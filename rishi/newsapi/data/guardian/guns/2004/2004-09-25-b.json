  "<p><strong>The Goldfish Bowl</strong><br>by Cherie Booth and Cate Haste<br>Chatto &amp; Windus \u00a318.99, pp321</p> <p>A goldfish bowl full of water, we know, has a distorting effect on its inhabitants. The convex glass means that at one moment the twinkly fish circling the bowl seem minuscule, while at the next an eye looms up at the apparent size of a marble.</p> <p>Perhaps it would have been a good idea for Cherie Booth to have pondered this optical illusion when she put together a study of the lives of Prime Ministers' wives with her friend, documentary maker and social historian Cate Haste.</p> <p>For although the goings on inside Number 10 are periodically fascinating, say, in the middle of a scandal or a political crisis, they are, at other times, bound to look trifling and irrelevant.</p> <p>For instance, the public was only briefly curious about what dinner times were like for Norma and John Major once they belatedly understood that, for a while at least, Currie was not a family favourite. For the rest of the time, we were content to imagine them scooping up their peas on forks and dressed in grey, like their caricatures on Spitting Image.</p> <p>In some respects, then, it was lucky for Booth and Haste's joint project that Melvyn Bragg made his veiled reference to serious domestic stress in the Blair household when he did.</p> <p>When the television presenter (and long-time partner of Haste) suggested in a recent television interview that the Prime Minister had just gone through a troubled patch in his private life, suddenly the goldfish bowl's magnifying effect was in operation with a vengeance and family matters inside Downing Street took on a greater significance.</p> <p>How on earth, we wondered, do the Blairs cope with constant observation and the pressure of work? The book's potential readership could not have been more agog.</p> <p>But the answer to this question is not found here. Instead, the book offers a mildly diverting survey of the views of the women (and the spouses are all wives, apart from Denis Thatcher) who have supported our country's leaders since 1955. The narrative pulls up abruptly at the instant the big black door closes behind Cherie and Tony in 1997.</p> <p>As a result, all readers get is an informed peek into the backrooms and kitchens of history. It is a jolly format, but unfortunately the canvas is rather too large and the people depicted too disparate for a binding theme to emerge. There is, it's true, an overarching feminist argument visible every now and then, but it is rather a hazy one and there are perhaps not enough examples of the slights and inconveniences suffered by wives over the years to strengthen this line.</p> <p>We do learn that when the news finally broke of Major's affair with Edwina Currie, it efficiently blighted an important Mencap charity event that Norma had been arranging for a year. She put it down, with saintly stoicism, to 'Sod's law', but the underlying point is that she, like all PM's wives, cannot really be heard to complain about her lot too vociferously because she would quite possibly never have been in a position to organise such a large-scale public event, or to have her own books published, if she had not married a future Prime Minister.</p> <p>Entertaining though the social insights thrown up by the contrasting backgrounds of 'first families' since the 1950s are, because of the wide scope of this study it is short on political context. This means the anecdotes that stand out are the naughty ones, the ones that offer a glimpse of family intimacies, or the lack of them.</p> <p>Over the decades, officials are repeatedly described barging into the Prime Minister's private apartment and even into his bedroom. So intrusive are the PM's aides that Clarissa Eden, wife of Sir Anthony, once declared she did not remember having one meal alone with her husband while he was in office.</p> <p>Cherie's personal contributions contain just the occasional hint of her own view. She does refer feelingly in passing to a sense that family life in Downing Street is successively 'sacrificed to the machine' and elsewhere to Tony having to take calls on a satellite phone even when he is climbing a mountain.</p> <p>She also highlights the fact she is the only mother to have raised young children at Number 10 since the tenure of the Asquiths, but there is no mention of the much-rumoured accommodation 'issue' with the Browns (who actually live in the smaller flat above Number 10).</p> <p>The only morsel we are offered is that Norma got the kitchen updated and that the larger flat in Number 11 (where the Blairs live) did not have a shower when Cherie arrived.</p> <p>Ultimately, of course, these are rather naive criticisms since this book is clearly a political work. It's not political in the parliamentary sense, although there is a jibe at Thatcher for not putting more women in the cabinet, but the fact is that Cherie still has to be guarded. Whenever this accomplished and opinionated woman has thrown caution aside and spoken out, it rebounds on her horribly.</p> <p>This will not always be the case. So what we have here is a coffee-table book that also serves as a marker reading 'watch this space'.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty</strong><br>by Kitty Kelley<br>Bantam Press \u00a320, pp706</p> <p>Kitty Kelley is the supreme bottom feeder of American biographers, nosing through a sludge of gossip columns and unattributed quotations for tidbits about the rich and powerful. But she finds genuine nourishment where others might turn away, revolted.</p> <p>It was Kelley who revealed that Nancy Reagan used astrologers to run her husband's White House, Kelley who exposed Nancy's affair with Frank Sinatra. And The Royals, her book about the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, never published in Britain, contains stuff that Gyles Brandreth can only utter in his wildest dreams.</p> <p>This latest volume, an unauthorised rootle through the three generations of Bush family powerplay is vintage Kelley. The family are 'thugs'. Bush 1 is a weak, corrupt Saudi stooge. His wife, Barbara is an icy control freak. Bush 2 is a reformed coke-snorter and recovering alcoholic, a draft-dodger and a bully. His brother, Jeb, is a serial adulterer. And so on.</p> <p>All of this is familiar to students of the National Enquirer and other American supermarket rags, but only Kelley has the nerve to weave it together into the gaudy texture of her Technicolor prose: 'Prescott [Bush] pointed to the young man's breakfast plate. \"It is the difference,\" he said, \"between ham and eggs. The chicken is involved. The pig is committed.\"'</p> <p>The 'young man' here is George W and, as if we needed any more evidence that Bush 2 is possibly the worst American President since Herbert Hoover, Kelley provides chapter and verse on his appalling record: his missing National Guard service record, his dysfunctional marriage to the chain-smoking Laura, and the binge-drinking excesses of his Yale years. A typical Kelley quote has a Bush contemporary remembering him 'roaring drunk, without a date, doing the Alligator... it's hard to see a guy like that holding down the highest office in the land'.</p> <p>But, like the potency of cheap music, sleazy biography has its own thrill, and its own rewards. Bush 1 always denied any involvement with Jennifer Fitzgerald, the White House gatekeeper who 'catered solely to the boss'. But Kelley nails the evidence and, although the secretive Bush family will not like it, demonstrates beyond doubt what the American press dared not print. One of the many paradoxes of American politics today is that it is publishers, not newspapers, which are playing the traditional role of the fourth estate.</p> <p>Kelley luxuriates in gossip about the Bush twins, boozy chips off the old block, and she conveys the strange Texan fundamentalist atmosphere that surrounds the President and his family.</p> <p>The Family claims to be 'an important polemic on wealth, power, and class in America'. But it's not: it's much more enjoyable than that. It's a prolix, well-researched, touchingly naive portrait of a political dynasty, but more Dallas than Camelot.</p>",
  "<p>There is no Lynda La Plante HQ at the address in Soho I've been given - just a copy shop. Oh dear. Fortunately, the man behind the counter has had a good lunch and volunteers the use of his phone. 'Nah, don't worry about it, love,' he says with a wink. 'Help yourself.' London. Don't you love it?</p> <p>Lynda La Plante doesn't. Finally traced to a first-floor corner office on the other side of the street, with a lordly wraparound perspective on the tourists and advertising creatives, she has a much bleaker view. People roll their eyes at 'the darkness' in her TV shows, she tells me, in her deep, unhurried, duchessy tones, but 'the darkness is all around us. It's very easy to see. It's down there in the street. We just had a guy screaming abuse, stark naked, trying to knife somebody over there in broad daylight. We've had four rapes in this street. Every single girl in my office has been mugged and burgled - sometimes repeatedly. It is life'.</p> <p>We live, La Plante assures me, in a very violent world. That's why people watch her tar-dark thrillers. They are a televisual comfort blanket, a fact I had not taken on board while watching the forthcoming Trial and Retribution - Blue Eiderdown (semen stains, bondage dungeons, pathologists saying: 'Now we get to the unsavoury bit'; all in all, a nastier vintage than the competition) through the grid of my fingers. 'People are drawn to the complexity of my games, the cleverness of the solution.' It's all about putting the pieces together, you see, a process unlike the irresolution of real life, where bits of the puzzle get lost under the sofa and you never manage to finish the sky.</p> <p>Since 1991, when the first Prime Suspect introduced audiences to the concept of event television, a devalued term nowadays, La Plante has been one of the UK's most successful TV dramatists. Yet the industry does not rate her particularly highly. She is viewed as a brand, a franchise, a bit of a cookie-cutter, unlike Paul Abbott, Tony Marchant and Stephen Poliakoff, writers who come at the medium from an predominantly literary tradition rooted in The Wednesday Play and the Royal Court.</p> <p>'La Plante's house style is to do with the format, not with individual scenes, twists or language,' says one TV screenwriter. 'It's almost as though she's a writer/producer in the American sense.' La Plante's strength is in her formula and she churns out different spins on it year after year. Prime Suspect was about a woman battling to prove herself in the police force, as is The Commander, with Amanda Burton, now in post-production, not forgetting The Governor, in which Janet McTeer battled to prove herself in the prison service. (A predominant theme in Trial and Retribution, set in both a knocking shop and a cop shop, is workplace misogyny.) From her first TV script, Widows (1983), La Plante's stories have centred on strong women struggling in a predominantly male world, a world perhaps not too unlike the industry which views her with a little reservation today.</p> <p>When asked whether she feels she has been undervalued because she sticks to a format, she agrees without any sign of rancour. She explains that Prime Suspect 'forced the issue of the way I work. It introduced me to the way I will now work forever'. She won't deviate because Prime Suspect 'was my intro to America, my calling card. I am, and will be, eternally grateful for it'. But yes, she finds her treatment galling. 'Totally. I am totally dismissed. My track record gives me no security at all. I have a letter from the BBC saying, \"Please send in your treatment and if we like it we may commission it to a script.\" My name means nothing. I could have sent it in as Warren Bittelbum and got the same reaction. And probably Warren Bittelbum would have been in with a far greater chance than anything I'd written.'</p> <p>She starts to pick at her Starbucks cup. Since setting up her own company and starting to produce, she has sold several dramas to US networks. In America, they understand her and what she pragmatically refers to as her 'product'. Right now, both Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford are pawing over a recent novel and there's something happening with Barry Levinson that sounds rather hush-hush. 'In America, I'm treated with far more respect. It's quite extraordinary, the difference.'</p> <p>La Plante may be 61 or 57 (whose account to believe?). She has a bright, ruddy bonfire of hair, expressive eyes heavily hemmed with mascara and fingers that clank with gold and diamonds. She is a trim little creature (she takes her latte skimmed and makes an 'ooh' face when I ask for a fat one) with a string of pearls and a bubblegum-coloured jersey slung around her neck.</p> <p>She looks and speaks like the character actress she used to be. With lots of eye-rolling, dramatic pauses and irritated laughter, she tells me about a trip to the BBC nine months ago to see Jane Root, then controller of BBC2, and how everyone messed up her name. 'The guy at the front desk asked me three times how to spell it. He kept saying, \"It's Linka La Planke.\"' When she was finally ushered up to the controller's office, after being kept waiting in reception for 45 minutes, Jane Root turned around, held up her hand, and said: 'Give me five minutes.'</p> <p>La Plante sighs. 'I thought, wonderful. Twenty-five years writing and I get, \"Give me five minutes.\" So I said, \"I'm sorry, I don't actually have five minutes now.\" It would be nice to feel that I was at least being shown respect.' Her Starbucks cup is, by this point, macrame. She chucks it in the bin with a shrug.</p> <p>If you want a crash course in La Plante's accomplishments as a TV writer/producer, you can do no better than pick up her new novel, forgettably entitled Above Suspicion. It's a routine police procedural thriller, in which a young and ambitious detective finds her feet in a murder investigation. The usual themes crop up: as in Trial and Retribution, there's a honeytrap, workplace discrimination, sex with inappropriate people. The difference is that Above Suspicion is as flat and plain and unshowy as a water biscuit. The sense of menace that penetrates her TV projects is entirely missing. This is her 10th novel. Her sales figures are always decent, but for all sorts of reasons (not least because she's worth something like \u00a325 million), I wonder why she bothers. 'I love it. I can never say that any TV project that I've written is mine, truthfully.'</p> <p>Does she accept that perhaps she is better at working collaboratively, with input from co-producers, directors, editors and actors, than on her own? Again, she doesn't take umbrage. 'I probably am,' she agrees. 'But a book is me. So when you pick up the book, it's my humour, my twists; no one else has had their hands on it but me and the police advisers. I love that process of unstoppable writing. Oh, it's lovely.'</p> <p>La Plante is famous for immersing herself in research. In the early days, she did it all herself, talking to victims, lawyers, scientists, detectives. Now, though she still turns up to high-profile court cases (she was in the public gallery at the Jeremy Bamber appeal and the Huntley trial), she has a team of researchers. The relationship she has worked hardest to maintain is the one with the police, who help her with access as well as fact-checking.</p> <p>'We get on. We work together. I never put anything in my script that isn't passed by them. My scripts have police fingerprints all over them: \"Your DNA result is too early\"; \"The blood spray is going the wrong way.\" Some people would find that very frustrating but I don't. It always advances the script.' She is a terrific advocate of the police (even though in her screenplays plenty of officers are rather bent).</p> <p>This interests me because a friend has said that in a film-school lecture many years ago, talking about researching the first Prime Suspect, La Plante remarked that she paid a notorious criminal's wife to facilitate a meeting with her husband and passed herself to the Broadmoor authorities as his sister-in-law. I ask if this is true.</p> <p>'You can't let that out,' says La Plante. Then she mumbles a bit. Sorry?</p> <p>'That was very early on,' she says, clearing her throat. 'I would never do that now. That was illegal. I can't ask the police to protect me and then do something like that. The prison authorities gave me open access for The Governor; if they'd known I'd done something like that, they wouldn't have helped me. To have these sessions is, you know, unbelievable. That [story] was told on the condition it was never repeated.' She doesn't deny it and she tells me that, in the early days, to get around the regulations, prisoners' wives 'would have a new fridge, stuff like that. Not a new car, but it would be a domestic thing that would help them, rather than cash'.</p> <p>Since the themes that she returns to are so specific, it's striking that her own background seems so innocent, so uneventful. La Plante - or Lynda Titchmarsh, as she was then - grew up comfortably in Crosby, Liverpool, the daughter of a sales manager. There was blackberrying, picnicking on Blundell Sands and elocution lessons. At 16, she won a scholarship to Rada, after which she found regular work at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre as well as on The Sweeney and Minder.</p> <p>One day, frustrated by the flimsiness of the script she was learning, she submitted her own. Widows was broadcast in 1984, six years after she married Richard La Plante, an American musician. Both were desperate for children, but La Plante became a mother only last year, close to a decade after they divorced. Lorcan William Henry was born in July 2003 in Florida. La Plante, who had been on the books of an adoption agency for years, saw him when he was two days old.</p> <p>With the help of her nanny, La Plante's productivity levels seem to be unaffected. At her home in Surrey, near Richmond Park, she gets up at 4.30am, as she always did, and writes uninterrupted for six hours. 'I have to stick to the same strict routine, I cannot deviate from it. They know not to contact me.' One day a week, she goes to Soho for business meetings. As much time as possible is spent with Lorcan.</p> <p>'I think I probably could not have been a good mother earlier on,' she says. 'There's a calmness now. I'm so much more knowledgeable. And I work at home. We had a severe panic recently because he got stung by a bee and he's allergic to bee stings... I carried him at a run to a medical centre, because I was there. Whereas, before, I would have been at the prison, the path lab, with the forensic department. Now I've got a team and I trust them. When I was younger, I felt that I had to do everything myself. I was draining myself. I was so tired. But now, if I go to a play, I'm honest enough to say I might nip out in the interval and go home.'</p> <p>She leaps up and does an imitation of Lorcan pacing, hands clasped behind back. He loves mobile phones, flushing lavatories, locking doors and feeding his tea to the Great Dane. 'He is a boy of all boys,' she says. 'I find everything about him amusing. You never know what's going to happen next. You sit down, thinking, \"God, I'm exhausted\", then he gets stung by a bee.'</p> <p>The other night, trawling through the TV channels after Lorcan had gone to bed, she caught a show that, though obviously aimed at his age group, had an unexpectedly soporific effect on her. 'What's the name of the one with the rainbow?' she asks urgently. 'Where they go \"Wheee-fphhhhh!\" like they're farting? \"Fphhhhh!\" Boohbah ! Yes, that's it! It's like watching something when you're on drugs. I love it. \"Fphhhhh!\"' La Plante has never had much need for downtime before, but now she's starting to see its appeal.</p> <p><strong>&amp;#183:</strong> Above Suspicion is published by Simon and Schuster, \u00a317.99</p> <p><strong>&amp;#183:</strong> Trial and Retribution: Blue Eiderdown is on ITV1, 11&amp;12 October</p>",
  "In the 1997 general election the Labour Party was rewarded with the biggest landslide since the war, a majority of 179 Labour MPs over all other parties. <p>Four years later, in 2001, the Conservatives added just a single MP to their benches, while Labour lost six and the Liberal Democrats gained six seats. Labour achieved an overall majority of 167, with 42 per cent of the vote. </p> <p>It's not going to be like that next time. Labour hasn't come close to 42 per cent for over a year. MORI has the party at just 32 per cent. The Tories are at 33 per cent and have bounced about a point or two higher or lower than Labour, but the Lib Dems, who polled only in the high teens in 2001, have consistently hit 20 per cent and more for over a year. On 25 per cent, registered recently by Populus and ICM as well as MORI, they are a threat to Labour's majority in an election. </p> <p>The decline in Labour support, with many Labour voters staying at home, would cause Labour to lose as many as 70 of their MPs. (Turnout looks to be between 50 per cent and 55 per cent, down from 59 per cent in 2001 and 72 per cent in 1997.) </p> <p>They are the disenchanted supporters of New Labour who are fed up with Tony Blair, the Old Labour socialists who voted for him in 1997 hoping they were electing a socialist government, and the Lib Dem supporters who, in 1997 (and a few in 2001), voted Labour in seats where their party stood no chance and they were desperate to keep the Tories out. </p> <p>Less than a third of the electorate is satisfied with Blair's performance, but then Michael Howard has only one person in four satisfied with him. </p> <p>According to MORI's analysis for the Fawcett Society, confidence in Blair is now as low as that experienced by Margaret Thatcher in the last 18 months of her premiership. </p> <p>Charles Kennedy is making much of being the only party leader with more people satisfied than dissatisfied with his leadership of the Liberal Democrats. But, when asked which party leader would make the best Prime Minister, Blair is still in first place, Howard in second and Kennedy a poor third. </p> <p>Iraq is a major worry for the British electorate, with 36 per cent saying that the war is one of the key issues facing the country, ahead even of the NHS. But when people are asked which two or three issues are the most important in helping them decide how to vote, health comes top, with 54 per cent choosing it from a list, down just seven points from the 2001 election. Then, education was second, crime third, taxation fourth and pensions fifth. Other than the issue of defence, not much has changed in terms of order of importance. </p> <p>But analysing those who say that the issue is important to them in deciding how to vote, there has been massive change since the last election. Then, Labour had a 35-point margin over the Tories on the health care issue; now it has fallen to 12 points, a 23-point drop. On education there has been a 30-point drop; on law and order, 15; on pensions, 20; and even on managing the economy, which Blair has 'delegated' to the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, there has been a 31- point drop. The Lib Dems are some way up from the 19 per cent of the last election, and if they do put three or four points on the 21 per cent to 22 per cent they've been scoring over the past year, they'd get another 20 or so seats. </p> <p>What is really interesting is that, of the 70 most marginal Labour seats, in only four did the Lib Dems stand second at the last election, while of the 70 most marginal Tory seats, in 23 the Lib Dems were the challenger. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> MORI's Political Monitor is from interviews with a representative sample of 1,924 adults aged 18+ at 192 sampling points across Britain, in-home on 10-14 September 2004.

  "David Blunkett increasingly fills the Dr Strangelove role in Tony Blair's government. Last week he gave an odd interview to the Guardian in which he offered himself as the Prime Minister's lightning conductor in the run-up to the election (Ja, ja, Mr President, let ze bombs rain down on me). He moved on to the subject of political apathy: 'People are dis-engaged because the world has changed so rapidly. That change causes greater insecurity and fearfulness, which reinforces alienation from the process of politics and from coping with change.' <p>The Strangelove analysis, naturally enough, did not dwell on the war - the government's failure to take notice of the vast anti-war movement and the unfolding disaster of Iraq which so many predicted, including, we know now, the most senior members of the Foreign Office. Neither did he refer to the corruption of the political discourse - the lies and manipulations which have so distorted debate in this country and were responsible for forcing the war on us. </p> <p>The electorate's disengagement, of course, has nothing to do with fear or people's lack of adaptability. </p> <p>It's just that we've been misled too often since Blair came to power and lied to on the most important foreign policy issue for the past 15 years. We understand that Labour is not going to bring the Prime Minister to book and that the party itself will never admit that the majority vote for war was an absolute calamity, so, yes, we think of something else. </p> <p>But this is not fear, Mr Blunkett, it's contempt and frustration. </p> <p>Blunkett's interview was not without value, because it underlined New Labour's tendency to pass the blame from the government to the electorate. If it's not the media's fault, they always blame the people. When hospitals founder and schools and transport systems do not meet the targets set at a more optimistic moment, the Prime Minister criticises the resistance and sluggishness of Britain's public service culture. </p> <p>Indeed, there is sometimes a sense that New Labour really doesn't much like the public and distrusts its addiction to tradition, which is presumably why the Prime Minister's office terminated the centuries-old post of Lord Chancellor by fax. Blair apparently has very little sense of history or the value of what's gone before, which I'm beginning to think is evidence of supreme egotism. </p> <p>After he became party leader, I did a series of interviews with him in his Islington home. It is the only time I've met him and I was struck by how likeable he was and how recognisably a part of my generation (we were born three weeks apart). Listening to the tapes now, I see that there is both certainty and shallowness in his deliberations. He was good at reeling off a list of policies without going into much detail. </p> <p>What I didn't understand then was that his faith in the programme of modernisation neatly replaced all the cumbersome requirements of a socialist ideology and gave him much more flexibility when he became Prime Minister. He could pick and choose the parts of the British constitution he wished to preserve and support. While he seems to rub along with the Queen perfectly well, he has a demonstrable lack of interest for Parliament. He has ignored the Commons often, has botched reform of the Lords, and has wrenched power away from his cabinet to a trusted inner circle at Number 10. </p> <p>There is also a surprisingly authoritarian streak in his nature, which I didn't spot in the Nineties. He appears to be relaxed on what one might call social freedoms - drinking and gambling laws, for instance - but is happy to preside over the restriction of important civil liberties. Anti-terrorism legislation has been used to lock up people without trial and arrest those demonstrating against the war outside airbases. </p> <p>Blair gets away with all this because he doesn't have to answer to anyone, even on the great issues of what to do in Iraq as terrorist cells now take root in the open wound like so many spores of MRSA. Most of those against the war concede that 90 per cent of Iraqis are glad to be rid of Saddam, but we were told this war was fought on a pretext of security, not regime change. </p> <p>Where there was once no terrorist problem, there is the gravest possible threat to Middle Eastern stability. The long-term preservation of the Saudi regime, one of the hidden motives, or at least collateral aims, of the US strategy, seems much less likely now there is a full-scale Islamist insurrection on its northern border. Iran is using this opportunity to test the will of both the UN and the West with its programme of nuclear development, in the belief that we don't have the stomach for a second confrontation. </p> <p>We are in trouble; the Middle East is in trouble. But so far Blair offers not the slightest apology or explanation. Neither is he particularly explicit about future strategy. It is plain that we cannot - and should not - leave the mess we have created, but how long are British troops going to be exposed in Basra? What will Blair do if the Iraqi elections in January are postponed or made unworkable by terrorist attacks? </p> <p>The Prime Minister has survived the Hutton and Butler reports, although a close reading of both leads you to have no doubt about his personality and the way Number 10 operates. It is a story of absolute power concentrated in a small number of individuals, most unelected, who ride rough-shod over the Labour Party, which now, incidentally, seems little more than the midwife to Blair's ambition. </p> <p>Yet Labour is ultimately responsible for Blair. There are many good people, such as Robin Cook, who saw what was going to happen in Iraq, but they have been unable to bring the party to focus on the enormous harm that has been done. The majority is still in the Prime Minister's thrall, to his power and apparent electability. </p> <p>Their duty, however, is much wider than many grasp. Imagine for one moment that Blair was deposed solely on the grounds of the Iraqi debacle. The damage inflicted on Bush in the run-up to the US election would be considerable, given the situation in Iraq. Surely this is something any good Labour member must want. Or has Blair skewed the party's judgment so much that it can't think straight on the actual nature of the Bush administration? </p> <p>The world needs to find a new coherence, reason and unity to fight the great evil which has arisen in Islam and that will not be done with Bush or Blair in power. We must hope that the Labour Party comes to its senses and removes Blair as soon as possible. He has nothing more to offer and, sooner or later, the electorate is going to see him for what he is - and the Labour Party will pay for it. </p> <p>But, there again, maybe they think Charles Kennedy deserves a chance.</p>",
  "<p>When he addresses the Labour Party conference in Brighton tomorrow, Gordon Brown will do so as the longest serving Labour Chancellor. What is more, in June he equalled Lloyd George's record of seven consecutive years at the Treasury, also becoming the longest serving Chancellor since Nicholas Vansittart (1812 to 1823). </p> <p>In his new book, Diaries 1980-2001 (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson), the Labour peer Giles Radice, a close observer and participant in the trials, tribulations and triumphs of Labour over many years, summarises Brown's chancellorship thus: 'Gordon Brown delivered a long period of low inflation, steady growth and falling unemployment. His decision to give operational management over monetary policy to the Bank of England, the tight control of public spending and sustained investment in education, health and policies to promote employment and help the less well-off were either the direct responsibility of the Chancellor or received his firm backing.' </p> <p>Although Lord Radice had a hand in helping Tony Blair win selection as a Labour candidate, he has always been his own man, and pays this tribute from the position of one who, while an admirer, certainly cannot be accused of being 'in the Brown camp'. But he also does so at a time when, after a long period in which he has enjoyed a very favourable public image, the Chancellor has become subject to adverse criticism over his putative role in the pensions crisis, and when more and more eyebrows have been raised about the viability of Brown's 'golden rule' with regard to public sector finances, not to mention the concerns about boom and bust in the housing market. </p> <p>In view of the extraordinarily good run Brown has had, these criticisms inevitably call to mind the Chancellor's favourite joke: 'There are two kinds of Chancellor: those who fail and those who get out in time.' But if there is one thing certain about Brown, it is that he does not want to go down as a failure; and if there is a second thing that is certain, it is that he does not wish to 'get out in time' by leaving behind a mess, because that would hardly redound to his credit, whether or not he proceeded to fulfil his ambition to succeed Blair. </p> <p>At the macro-economic level, Brown's record is certainly very impressive. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies may constantly be chiding him over his conduct of the nation's finances but, like the proverbial cat, this Chancellor has many fiscal lives. By comparison with those of the US and much of the EU, Brown's fiscal record is exemplary. Meanwhile, as the IFS has recently cal culated, the country's economic growth performance since 1997 has been impressive by past standards. Thus, against an average growth rate of 2.4 per cent from the Second World War to 1996/7, economic growth under Brown's stewardship has averaged 2.7 per cent, compared with 2.4 per cent in the Seventies, 2.3 per cent in the Eighties and 1.7 per cent from 1990 to 1997. </p> <p>The Treasury enjoys reminding us at every opportunity that the country has enjoyed the longest period of sustained economic growth for many decades. And it is not just partisan commentators in the UK who note that, unlike most other industrial countries, Britain under Brown has not experienced a single quarter of contraction, or what economic analysts like to call, in that frightful term, 'negative growth'. </p> <p>For this experience, it is widely acknowledged that much of the credit must go to the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which, after a long period when short-term economic management was out of fashion, has been managing demand in the economy by the month - and even, on occasion (such as the nervous period in financial markets after 11 September 2001), by the fortnight. </p> <p>In a sense, the MPC can hardly believe its luck. It is a standing joke among present and past members that, whenever someone retires, in his or her farewell remarks the point is invariably made that things must become tougher henceforth. And Mervyn King himself has often warned that it would be foolhardy to assume that things can go on like this. </p> <p>So far, however, so good. And it is Brown who takes the credit for the remarkable decision, for a Labour administration, to give operational freedom to the Bank of England. Under previous Labour governments, the Bank had often been regarded as a 'class enemy'. But Brown turned the conventional wisdom on its head and decided, that, if he was to fulfil his ambitions for public spending, he had to get the financial markets on his side. The way to avoid a 'bankers' ramp' was to hand authority over to the bank that bankers and traders most respect: the Bank of England. </p> <p>If anything, this strategy has been almost too successful. Although the pound has recently started to decline, it has, on average, been very high for most of Brown's chancellorship. This has affected the performance of overseas trade, with imports rising much faster than exports. Indeed, since 2001 the volume of UK exports has actually declined slightly. And the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development pointed out in June that 'the real exchange rate, measured in terms of consumer prices' was, in March, 'at its highest level since the early Eighties'. </p> <p>Although the pound has edged down since its further 6 per cent rise in January and February, the prolonged impact of its strength on our international competitiveness has been a counterweight to the myriad detailed measures the Chancellor has introduced to boost productivity. </p> <p>This Labour government, haunted by past failures to control inflation, has been lucky to hold office against a background of disinflationary trends around the world, associated with the ascendancy of independent central banks and intense price competition among multinationals under what is colloquially known as 'globalisation'. Nevertheless, it is a considerable tribute to the MPC, Brown's creation, that the macro-economic environment has been so relatively stable. </p> <p>How long this will continue is anybody's guess. While appearing, overall, to have moved from a hawkish to a dovish position in recent months, the MPC seems to be unclear as to whether it has got things under control or not. The August Inflation Report, and a subsequent speech by 'external' member Steve Nickett, gave the impression the MPC thought fears about 'excessive spending' and a consumer debt crisis had been exaggerated. Other members of the MPC are not so sure. </p> <p>The MPC's job is to control not the level of house prices, but the overall level of inflation. Whether or not the long-predicted fall in house prices is under way, and notwithstanding the MPC's latest assessment that 'the news from the labour market in the past month has been on the weak side', the OECD has just raised its forecast for UK growth this year from 3.1 per cent to to 3.4 per cent, and still sees the economy expanding at a rate that could put pressure on capacity and inflation, leading to a possible further rise in interest rates. The International Monetary Fund seems more worried about the possibility of a house price crash and slowdown in the economy. </p> <p>With regard to macro-economic policy, the buck stops at Brown's desk. So far, so good. But there is a lot of nervousness in the air.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> William Keegan's latest book, The Prudence of Mr Gordon Brown (Wiley), is now available in paperback at \u00a39.99.</p>",
  "<p>Bernie Ecclestone, Lakshmi Mittal, Paul Grayson: Labour has been so effective at snuggling up to business since 1997 that it has managed to get itself embroiled in the kinds of cash-for-access scandals that were once the preserve of the Tory party. </p> <p>Winning over doubters in the business world was key to the long, slow transformation that brought Labour into power: but with another election just months away, the government can no longer take the confidence of the money men for granted. </p> <p>It started with seafood. 'Never have so many crustaceans died in vain,' Michael Heseltine quipped at the height of then shadow chancellor John Smith's 'prawn cocktail offensive', in which he whirled around the Square Mile trying to convince traditionally Tory-supporting bankers, brokers and directors that he wouldn't threaten their prosperity. Labour went on to lose its fourth successive election in 1992, stung by Tory charges that it was about to drop a 'tax bomb' on middle England. </p> <p>But that was before Black Wednesday, in September that year, when Norman Lamont ramped up interest rates to 15 per cent in a vain attempt to prop up the pound against the Deutschmark, and wiped out the Tories' hard-won reputation for economic management at a stroke. Labour was handed the opportunity it had longed for, to take over as the party business could trust. </p> <p>Handing independence to the Bank of England as soon as he arrived in the Treasury in May 1997 is still viewed as Gordon Brown's master-stroke, bringing him an immediate credibility windfall, as the markets bet that borrowing costs would probably be lower once rate-setting was divorced from politics. </p> <p>Stephen Alambritis, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, says Brown is still reaping the political benefits of that early decision, and the stable economic environment it helped to create. 'There is a concern about the cumulative effects of regulation, but that is being cushioned by the low interest rates,' he says. </p> <p> Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, agrees. 'On the economic policy front, his best decision was his first decision,' he says. </p> <p>Over time, though, businesses have begun to take the more stable macroeconomic framework for granted, and quibbles about Labour's interventionist policies in other areas have begun to get louder. 'It's a very regulating government, it's a very interfering government,' says Digby Jones, director-general of the CBI. 'They regulate first, and they ask questions second. I wish occasionally they would reward ministers for doing nothing. That would be refreshing!' </p> <p>Leach at the IoD agrees. 'Survey after survey of our members shows that regulation is a major issue. And Brown's tax and spend policy is the wrong way around - you've got to get the system working effectively first; then you put more money in.' </p> <p>'Tax and spend' is a label the Brown Treasury has fought hard to avoid. It was very proud of the public consensus it consciously tried to build in the run-up to the 2002 Budget - that improving the NHS was a goal worth paying extra for. But the consensus never really stretched as far as businesses. </p> <p>The CBI and other groups reacted angrily to the announcement that firms' national insurance contributions would rise. They thought they had a close working relationship with the Treasury, and were delighted with measures such as research and development tax credits; but the \u00a34 billion rise in employer NICs came as a bolt from the blue. Iain Vallance, the outgoing CBI president, accused Labour at the time of 'cutting open the goose that lays the golden egg'. </p> <p>'Too much red tape' has long been a gripe of businesses, but Ruth Lea, of the right-wing Centre for Policy Studies, says firms don't like being used as tools to further other government aims. </p> <p>She singles out Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt, who mooted the idea of a year's paid statutory maternity leave last Monday. 'The gloves are off,' Lea says. 'Whatever [Hewitt] might have said in the past, what she's really about is social engineering.' </p> <p>Martin Temple, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, is also concerned about the weight of legislation on his members, many of whom are small businesses. 'The economy has been better than we expected, but the cost of government has been an issue, and remains an issue.' He points to energy costs, employment legislation and pensions as areas for complaint. </p> <p>Pensions policy has become a political minefield for Brown. With the dotcom boom in full swing, his decision in 1997 to prevent pension funds from claiming back the tax they paid on share dividends elicited barely a whimper from the markets. Its laudable aim was to persuade companies to reinvest their profits, instead of facing pressure from shareholders to pay them out as dividends. </p> <p>But once the market started to turn down, opening up giant black holes in many corporate pension funds, things looked very different. City investors now blame the \u00a35bn-a-year increase in pen sion funds' tax bills for exacerbating the funding shortfalls in many of Britain's corporate pension funds - and the lacklustre performance of the FTSE in recent years. </p> <p>Vince Cable, the Lib-Dem Treasury spokesman, says pensions policy, and in particular the removal of tax relief, is at the heart of City suspicions about Labour. 'It was a catalyst,' he says. 'What stuck in the craw was the spectacular naivete that the stock market bubble would go on for ever and they could just take money out of it.' </p> <p>Now, he says, 'there are massive worries about long-term pensions. I think there's a feeling that the current system isn't working, and can't be made to work.' </p> <p>The complex system of means-tested benefits for the elderly is aimed at giving most help to the poorest; but the financial institutions complain that it discourages saving, and consumers don't understand how it works. </p> <p>Beefed-up City regulation, led by the FSA, is another bugbear. When the Bank of England was in charge of banking regulation, it was seen as batting for the City, giving it a voice in government. The FSA is seen as meddling. 'It's a very, very intrusive regime,' says one City analyst. Callum McCarthy, the FSA's chairman, received a less-than-warm reception when he addressed the City banquet at the Mansion House last week. </p> <p>Notwithstanding the long list of niggles, however, there are still two great bulwarks that have prevented Labour's business support from ebbing away. The first is the strong, stable performance of the economy: unemployment remains at its lowest level for a generation, and Brown avoided the recessions that hit the US and much of the eurozone after the post 11 September stock market crash. </p> <p>More important, though, is the fact that the Tories still aren't seen as fully credible. Appointing a 'shadow secretary of state for deregulation' is an attempt to tap into business anxieties about Labour; but John Redwood is not the most hard-hitting political performer. And until the Tories can promise business a regime they think would be more to their advantage, they're unlikely to swing their weight - and their cash - behind electing Howard and his team. </p> <p>As one insider put it when asked about the City's relationship with Labour last week: 'The honeymoon finished long ago. We've had the divorce, but it's being followed by a long period of celibacy.'</p> <p><strong>How six key Number 11 decisions went down with business</strong></p> <p><strong>May 1997:</strong> Bank of England independence. Brown hands power to set interest rates to a new Monetary Policy Committee. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Universal applause. Independent monetary policy is seen as one of the key factors that has underpinned the economy since 1997.</p> <p><strong>July 1997:</strong> In his first full Budget, Brown announces that pension funds will no longer be able to reclaim tax on share dividends. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> At the time, indifference; more recently, fury. The \u00a35 billion-a-year extra cost is blamed for exacerbating what has become known as the 'pensions crisis'. But the Treasury points out it was part of a pro-business package that also included a 2 per cent cut in corporation tax.</p> <p><strong>April 1999:</strong> National minimum wage comes into force. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Suspicion, giving way to relief. Predictions of resultant job losses fail to materialise, partly because the wage is set lower than unions had hoped, at \u00a33.60. The Tories later drop their opposition to a minimum wage, underlining the fact that it has been seen as a success.</p> <p><strong>April 2000:</strong> Firms become responsible for administering the government's working families tax credit through the payroll. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Irritation at the extra costs involved. The Treasury later rescinds the decision, but the Institute of Directors says: 'It would have been better if it had never been introduced in the first place. Employers are going to have to pay significant amounts of money to amend their payroll systems yet again.'</p> <p><strong>April 2002:</strong> Employers' national insur ance contributions increase by 1 per cent as part of a tax-raising package aimed at pouring more money into the NHS. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Horror, giving way to resignation. Companies agree that Britain's crumbling infrastructure is in need of investment, but they hadn't planned on paying for it themselves.</p> <p><strong>Summer 2004:</strong> The government suggests that Crossrail, the long-delayed transport link through the centre of London, could finally go ahead - but only if business will stump up some of the cash. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Sceptical approval. The overcrowded transport infrastructure is widely seen as one of the major barriers to running a business in Britain; London mayor Ken Livingstone gets a big cheer at the City banquet for backing the line.</p>",
  "I can almost see the sheaf of papers, as white as the great curved walls, lying forgotten on the table by some Labour dreamer entranced by the view of the Salisbury Crags just beyond the committee room windows. I can almost imagine the nationalist hand reaching to pick them up. <p>There, on the page, were Adrian Colwell's reflections on the winning manifesto in the recent SNP leadership election. Colwell, one of Jack McConnell's advisers, wrote that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon's pledge to cut business rates and corporation tax was worth 'pre-empting'. He said that their plans for transport, for 'citizenship classes' in schools, and for lowering the voting age, were also 'worth considering'. He was like a magpie hopping over the 40 policy proposals. </p> <p>It's been a good week for the SNP. The summer's leadership election had seemed the last sigh of a sick party, with few listening to the arguments in a predetermined poll (few, it seems, except Scottish Labour). The party conference in Inverness could have easily been an expiration, yet it was not. </p> <p>Instead, the early froth gave way to stout depths. The picture of Salmond and Sturgeon standing on the bridge over the Ness may have had that curiously oleaginous sheen that still clings to the leader, may have failed to humanise Sturgeon, but their words caught the attention. The enduring impression was the thoughtful and expectant silence of their audience. </p> <p>Nothing aches in the nationalist heart like the suspicion that George Robertson, Labour's main proponent of devolution in the run-up to the 1997 election, was right when he said: 'Devolution will kill the SNP stone dead.' The SNP had really believed that it was just a stepping stone to independence and have sulked as the opposite proved true. Last week, it seemed that even the truest of the home rulers now realises that Robertson's must not be the last word. </p> <p>The philosophical strength of the SNP conference was provided by Kenny MacAskill, Sturgeon's erstwhile running mate in the leadership election before Salmond made his grand return, and now her deputy in the parliament. It has proved quite an advantage to the SNP that MacAskill found himself without work over the summer and, instead, concentrated on an 80-page book that James Mitchell, professor of government at Strathclyde University, calls an 'important, possibly seminal, contribution'. </p> <p>In Building a Nation, MacAskill warns against the nationalist urge for such showy separation as occurred when the Irish Free State was formed in 1922. He says there is no need for postboxes to be repainted. 'The existence of a nation state is no longer dictated by leitmotifs on a variety of services or a different name or colour for some organisations. It is designed by representation in the institutions that matter and control over functions that are essential to the economy and a distinctive society.' He doesn't think we'd need our own DVLA or Ordnance Survey. </p> <p>Such words lie in clever contrast to Sturgeon's furious cry last week that we had been prevented from keeping Scottish troops out of Iraq by Holyrood's 'cosy consensus'. It's a guess, but I suspect such words would worry many voters. Whatever people feel about the Iraq war, I can't believe there are many who wouldn't recoil at removing Scottish regiments from the plans of our military chiefs once a decision to go to war had been taken. </p> <p>It is in such statements that the distrust of the SNP as a party of government lies. The argument in MacAskill's book is that the SNP can only lead a sceptical Scotland to independence by 'expanding the powers of the parliament and increasing the ambition and self confidence of the people'. He believes, rightly, that the only way we will ever trust the SNP is if the party works to makes the parliament, and the country, a success. Hence the title; the SNP's job is 'building a nation'. </p> <p>He isn't satisfied with just making the case for a gradualist approach. He comes up with a plan to stop voters viewing the SNP as just another centre-left party, only less experienced in governing than Labour. 'The party needs to recognise that the arguments have moved on and both adapt to and lead the debate. Declaring itself in support of individuals and communities, not simply the state.' </p> <p>It still seems a pity that the SNP has chosen to return to the past and place Salmond back at the top, although his speech on Friday certainly wowed them. With \u00a3250,000 required to fight the next Westminster election, and its debt running at around \u00a3800,000, the party does need his fund-raising skills, not least with his greatest fan, Sean Connery. His entry into the race also allowed MacAskill the time to write his book, but it will be up to MacAskill - and Sturgeon - to make sure he never again eclipses other voices in the party. </p> <p>What is so curious is that the conference, and the confidence it has inspired, coincides with the opening of the new parliament building. Already, Sturgeon seems to be adept at skewering McConnell at First Minister's questions, just as the Labour leader has raised his game in response. Could Enric Miralles's design be working its magic? Both leaders said they needed to improve, and now it seems to be true. It has been a good week for Scottish politics. After this conference, there are signs of better times ahead.</p>",
  "<p>Denise, 62, wants to know how her health problems might affect her finances:</p> <p>'I was diagnosed with leukaemia shortly after I retired two years ago. As it is in the very early stages, I have not told my family: I want to save them unnecessary worry. </p> <p>I have an occupational pension of about \u00a38,000 plus a state pension, but I am not sure what to do about two freestanding FSAVCs, one worth \u00a338,000 and the other \u00a312,000. I have not converted them into annuities yet because I know the pension rules are being changed and that annuity rates are low. I am aware that I can get an enhanced annuity rate because of my leukaemia but I am not sure whether it would be better to spend my savings as and when I want and leave the FSAVCs so that they can form part of an inheritance for my children and grandchildren, take the annuities as soon as possible, or wait until the new pension rules come into effect, when I believe I can take 25 per cent cash. </p> <p>Regarding my health, I am feeling absolutely fine at the moment and have plenty of energy. I could live for 20 more years and die of something else, according to my doctor. On the other hand, an insurance salesman told me that they reckon seven years for leukaemia patients - not the most tactful person you could meet. </p> <p>At the moment I am working part time and expect to earn about \u00a38,000 this year. I have around \u00a325,000 in savings in Peps and Isas. I also have money set aside from my pension lump sum to pay off an outstanding mort gage of \u00a315,000 in two years' time. My current house was purchased for \u00a3150,000 in February 2003. I have an endowment policy with Norwich Union which finishes in 2011, but I am trying to get compensation for that as the final date is nine years after my retirement date. That policy is currently worth about \u00a316,000. It will pay \u00a326,000 on death but was originally projected at \u00a345,000. I have two other small endowment policies against loans, neither of which look like reaching its initial target. I have repaid the loans and now wonder whether it is still worth paying the premiums on these policies.'</p> <p><strong>First and foremost: enjoy life to the full</strong></p> <p>I am very sorry to hear about your leukaemia. You are doing the right thing by taking it into account in your retirement planning. Your first consideration, though, should be your own income requirements rather than the interests of your beneficiaries. Whatever your life expectancy, it is important that you enjoy your retirement to the full while you are still in good health. There is no point in leaving your money invested in your FSAVCs if your income in inadequate. </p> <p>Having said that, income does not seem to be your immediate problem as you are working part time. Indeed if you did take the annuity now, it would increase the amount of income tax you pay.</p> <p>Normally it makes sense to take the tax-free lump sum from a pension where this is available, even if maximum income is required. Investing the money in an ordinary life annuity is more tax efficient: part of the income from ordinary annuities is treated as a 'return of capital' by the tax man, which means it is tax-free. Payments on pension annuities, on the other hand, are taxed in full as earned income.</p> <p>If you don't need the income immediately, waiting until after April 2006 when the pension rules change will mean you can take a 25 per cent tax-free cash sum from your FSAVC funds. With your smaller FSAVC, you may be able to take the whole amount in cash, less a 20 per cent tax charge on the balance above the 25 per cent tax free sum. This is because after April 2006 the amount deemed to be a 'trivial pension' (and therefore available as cash) is also being increased from \u00a32,500 to \u00a315,000.</p> <p>Another potential advantage of waiting until 2006, points out Dean Mirfin of adviser Key Retirement Solutions, is that you will be older and may therefore receive a better annuity rate.</p> <p>You ask whether it would be better to use up your other savings before you take your pensions. John Turton, director of life and pensions at financial adviser Bestinvest, says this is a sound approach if you are likely to be liable for inheritance tax on other assets. He says 'Good succession planning (especially for someone in poor health) is to take privately held assets liable to inheritance tax first and the pension second. Unvested pensions are written under trust and will pay out inher itance tax free benefits on death before vesting.' However, it would appear that your assets may be under the inheritance tax threshold (\u00a3263,000 for 2004-5) so tax may not be an issue for you.</p> <p>To help you make a decision about your FSAVCs, you should approach an independent financial adviser to check what rate you could get for an 'impaired life annuity'. These annuities pay out higher amounts to those with health problems, depending on the extent to which the actuaries believe they will affect life expectancy. Peter Quinton, managing director of The Annuity Bureau, suggests sourcing an impaired life annuity through a specialist provider such as GE Life, Just Retirement or Pension Annuity Friendly Society.'</p> <p>Whenever you decide to buy an annuity 'the major risk is whether it will pay out enough should death occur prematurely', says Turton. 'This could be countered with a guaranteed period or via an alternatively secured pension from 2006. However, if this is done, the annuity rate will fall.'</p> <p>Under current rules you are not required to purchase an annuity until age 75. Mirfin says: 'If Denise can manage on her income/pension as it stands it may be advantageous to put off purchasing the annuity until she really needs to supplement her income.'</p> <p>If you decide to delay, it will be mean your FSAVCs remain invested and can continue growing in a virtually tax-free environment. However, Mirfin advises you to check that the charges and investment performance of your FSAVC providers are competitive. If not, you may get a better deal by switching to a lower-cost stakeholder pension.</p> <p>As regards your mortgage and endowment policies, you may be better off using your savings to clear your loan. The advantage of keeping your endowment policies is that they provide life insurance cover which, because of your health and age, you would otherwise find difficult to purchase.</p> <p><strong>Denise's to-do list</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> If you need extra income, do not put off buying an annuity for the sake of your beneficiaries. </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> If you wait until 2006, you will be able to take a 25 per cent tax-free cash sum from your FSAVCs and possibly take the remainder of the small policy in cash too.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> If you decide to buy an annuity, seek the help of an independent financial adviser with specialist knowledge of impaired-life annuities.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> If you are going to put off your annuity purchase until 2006 or later, check that your FSAVC policies are competitive in terms of cost and performance.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Consider paying off your mortgage.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> Bear in mind that your existing endowments are providing you with an element of life insurance.</p> <p><strong>Let us help you</strong></p> <p>Do you need some financial coaching?

  "<p>Poor Britney and her ghastly nuptials: tracksuits, chicken wings, burgers, it seemed less of a wedding than what you'd come across during a bank holiday toilet stop at a motorway service station. The generous might care to spin the event as a statement on the ridiculous overblown ceremonies of the rich and famous, a defiant refusal to keep up with the Zeta-Joneses, but that would be ignoring the fact that Britney already has one rushed, boozed-up, ill-conceived wedding under her belt, doesn't really a need a second, is actually, remember, a multi-million selling artist and young woman of note.</p> <p>And yet she still ends up making her vows in a room smelling of cheeseburgers, surrounded by people with 'Pimps' and 'Maids' written on their backs, that dancer husband of hers flashing a smile that seemed all dollar signs and subtext. I didn't think it was trashy. The young Elizabeth Taylor flashing diamonds as big as babies' heads was trashy; Roseanne Barr cackling about her liposuction on live television was trashy; 'Trashy' has often been good, self-affirming, especially for non-Wasp females in show business. Britney's wedding seemed something altogether different, such a long dark howl of desperation and low self-esteem she could have been auditioning in front of the priest to join Nirvana.</p> <p>Of course, serial weddings aren't new in showbiz circles. Watching J-Lo in action, it often seems as if we are coming to the point of adopting a damning new anti-female axiom: Never the bridesmaid, always the bride. However, while many might debate the long-term future of J-Lo's liaisons, the point is they also have no past, no history; no sense of emotional hangover. Even the one that came after Ben Affleck never seemed to be about Ben Affleck, but rather about a woman who just loves putting on big dresses and getting married and, rather like a cake-cutting Terminator, cannot be stopped. By contrast, Britney's weddings, both of them, indeed Britney's entire behaviour over the past few years, seems to be coming from the same place - her tortuous split from childhood sweetheart and fiance, Justin Timberlake.</p> <p>Look again at those chaotic boozy wedding snaps of the new Mr and Mrs Federline, and that's what screams out loud and clear - 'Rebound!' In Britney's case, such a huge and obvious rebound it's a surprise she's not pictured suspended in mid-air. Not much is known about the rebound probably because those people who are rebounding don't want to know. When you're newly enamoured, it's your fresh start, and you don't want to hear the word 'syndrome'. You don't want to be told that you're bouncing around like an out-of-control spacehopper trying to get anywhere else but where you used to be.</p> <p>A self-justifying madness takes over accompanied by the kind of grown-up reasonable behaviour you might expect from a toddler who's dropped their ice lolly in the puddle and won't rest until an ice cream appears instead. 'It just feels so right,' rebounders say, as they arrange to move in with the man or woman they met selling the Big Issue outside Sainsbury's two weeks ago, whose main claim to their heart seems to be a distinct lack in common with their previous partner. Could this be the future for Personal Ads: 'Man seeks woman who is not blonde, not 5ft 7in, and doesn't like chocolate, for temporarily fulfilling rebound relationship'? Either that or the new partner has lots in common with the ex, rather too much, in fact. Here I'm thinking of the man who told me his new girlfriend reminded him of his ex in all ways but the most important: 'I haven't pissed her off yet.'</p> <p>The only thing that sucks worse than being in a rebound relationship is being the third party in a rebound relationship - the bounced-upon, as it were. And that's because being in a relationship with someone rebounding is like trying to grab a snowflake: at first contact with the heat of reality, it melts. It was bad enough for Diana, and all that 'there were three of us in that relationship' stuff, but what about if the third person is a ghost, a memory, an itch that wasn't properly scratched; what if the main thing about you is just a negative - that you're not her or him, and that will do for now.</p> <p>It's mad really. If somebody knocked on your door and said: 'Hello, could I waste the next six months of your life brooding about my ex' you would probably scream and slam the door, but still you get people trying to turn their rebound into something real (true love, sharing last Rolos, weddings in tracksuits) simply to prove they've moved on, which is all-round sad and selfish. All this said, I hope Britney enjoyed her wedding. If she wants to get in touch I know a great caterer for her divorce. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Deadwood </strong> Sky One </p> <p><strong> She's Gone</strong> ITV1 </p> <p><strong> Property Ladder</strong> C4 </p> <p><strong> Changing Rooms</strong> BBC1 </p> <p><strong> Grand Designs Abroad</strong> C4 </p> <p>On paper, <strong> Deadwood</strong> has exactly the sort of pedigree to excite the casual consumer of glossy new US dramas, and even me: it's from HBO (The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Sex and the City, blah), is written and produced by David Milch, whose first ever filmed script (for Hill Street Blues) won an Emmy and who subsequently created NYPD Blue, it's directed by Walter Hill, who made 48 Hours, and stars Ian McShane. </p> <p>Come again? Surely not Ian McShane of Lovejoy fame, the 1980s antique dealer with a twinkly eye for posh totty whose smoothy charms and impressive tan must have greatly inspired David 'The Duke' Dickinson? Well, no, actually, it's not the Lovejoy McShane here, but the Sexy Beast version - McShane's Al Swearengen (you could only call a character Al Swearengen had he really existed) is less a saucy and twinkling bottom-patter and stroker of olde English oak than a downright dirty sonofabitch saloon proprietor, only partially recognisable beneath an impressive 'tache. Still, those Rada-rounded vowels do occasionally escape from somewhere deep inside McShane's ill-fitting American accent, which presumably explains why, within the first few minutes of the opener, another character was forced to accuse him of being a limey. It's a fair cop. </p> <p> Deadwood is set in a lawless South Dakota town of the same name: it's 1876, there's gold in them thar hills, Swearengen's clientele includes Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) and Calamity Jane, and the body count is running at an average of about one a day. In the first few minutes there was a hanging, some unveiled threats from a posse of angry men, the promise of a shootout, plenty of liquid shots at the bar and a beaten-up prostitute - all predictably par for the western course - but then again it's always nighttime in Deadwood, everybody wears brown and plot is often forgone in favour of people shouting 'Cocksucker', so I was already starting to lose my concentration. </p> <p>In the event it took 10 minutes for me to remember why my favourite western is Blazing Saddles. Though I am obviously loath to admit it, this is probably due to chromosomes: I have a problem buying into all that mythological wild west machismo, partly because, excluding the occasional Colt.45, there's not enough in the way of snappy accessorising but, more importantly, because there's never any wit or irony. </p> <p>I can quite see why Milch might want to drag the western genre kicking and screaming on the end of rope at the end of a horse into the 21st century, but there's no denying that Deadwood isn't really aimed at an overseas audience, even an overseas audience that admires the output of HBO. If you don't like horse operas, this one won't change your mind. </p> <p>Structurally, Deadwood is about as convincing as the 2-D plywood Main Street on the Universal backlot. It's got to be wrong to kick off a 12-part series with an almost incomprehensible (19th-century South Dakota meets 21st-century South Central) chunk of lengthy dialogue between two characters who have, as yet, no context, far less any names, and are shot in tight close-up, in the near dark. I feel duty bound to return to this show but, frankly, after one episode I was left feeling that if Deadwood was as good as it should be we wouldn't be watching its first run on Sky. </p> <p>Incidentally, I wonder whether McShane was their first choice. Since his recent (hirsute and evil) turn in Cold Mountain, Ian's Sexy Beast co-star, Ray Winstone, would have been perfect, too, but I tend to think Winstone is ideal for most roles that don't involve wearing lipstick. </p> <p>In last Sunday's ITV1 drama <strong>She's Gone</strong>, Winstone played Harry Sands, husband to Joanna (Lindsey Coulson), father of Michael (Gary Lucy) and Olivia. When the latter goes missing in Turkey during her gap-year job working for a charity, Dad flies off to sort it 'aht' but pretty soon discovers his princess's idea of charity work has less to do with bringing joy to disadvantaged children than it does with bringing pleasure to middle-aged businessmen: Olivia's been working nights as a pole dancer in a seedy club in Istanbul but, after a row with her flat mate, has apparently done a bunk. Or has she? </p> <p> She's Gone was a remarkable piece of drama, but unfortunately not for any of the right reasons. It was as if writer Simon Tyrell had quite purposefully made every character do the opposite of what anybody would do in a similar situation in real life, and then sat back to see whether he could get away with it without anybody noticing. </p> <p>This meant that Olivia's friend and flatmate (and, it was later revealed, Sapphic love interest), Manda, was charmlessly rude and confrontational, Our Man in Istanbul was implausibly aggressive ('Maybe your daughter shouldn't be flashing her tits to men twice her fucking age_') - and, when he wasn't staring into the middle distance looking pained (I'd never thought of Winstone as an impressionist, but this was an uncanny Amanda Burton), mild-mannered businessman Harry suddenly started waving a gun around, presumably because every Winstone character is contractually obliged to wield a weapon at some point. </p> <p>Meanwhile, She's Gone appeared to have been overseen by a director who had once read a book entitled 'How to Direct a Taut Psychological Thriller' but who had never previously had access to helpful stuff such as, say, actors, cameras and scripts. The parts played by Lindsey Coulson and Gary Lucy were entirely redundant and the Sandses' marital breakdown subplot both pointless and time-consuming; we'd barely seen them on screen together so it was hard to invest much in the relationship. </p> <p>This was all the more confusing because She's Gone was directed by Adrian Shergold, who usually knows what he's doing (he made last year's excellent The Second Coming). Unless, that is, it turns out that the auteur of this dreary, wearyingly plotted cliche was somebody who had merely stolen Shergold's identity - just like the Kurdish girl who, it turned out, had run off with Olivia's passport. </p> <p>Olivia wasn't dead, then, but I was fading fast. In the final scene she had a big reunion hug with her mum and dad and that was that: loose ends remained untied, Gary Lucy's end was presumed missing (was he dead? bored? or simply mourning the decision ever to leave Footballers' Wives ?) and I was, well, confused. Looking back at my notebook I see the words: 'It's OK, it's fine, don't worry, thank God it's all over now.' but it turns out that this was a transcription of the still, small voiceover in my head. </p> <p>Time, then, for some genuine escapism in the form of the first of the new series of C4's <strong> Property Ladder</strong>, presented by the excellent Sarah Beeny, in which we met the world's most irritating would-be property developer, Nathalie Milton, a young woman for whom pink is less a colour than a creed. </p> <p>Breathy-voiced Barbietastic Nathalie wore a different ab-fabulous outfit in every single shot and was a disciple of all things twinkly and spangly, thus her idea of 'developing' a crumbling art deco house in Dorset was to spend \u00a32,500 on purple 'digital' ceramic tiles (stylistic pointer: a set of coasters from Abigail's Party) for the downstairs loo, installing an aqua and lilac-coloured kitchen, (ideal for baking with Play-Doh) and investing \u00a3245 on a single roll of wallpaper . </p> <p>Nathalie bought the house for \u00a3375,000 and then went four times over budget on the development, spending a gobsmacking \u00a3259,000. When three agents valued the finished property at somewhere between \u00a3550,000 and \u00a3650,000, Nathalie ignored them and put it on the market for \u00a3750,000 where, needless to say, it languishes unsold today. </p> <p>Watching Beeny bite her tongue as the budget spiralled out of control and the awesomely ugly result was revealed made for a wildly entertaining hour, and, in the week that also saw the start of the final (15th) series of <strong> Changing Rooms</strong>, it's clear that while the makeover genre's days are numbered, the right sort of property show can still pull in the viewers, particularly if it includes pots of multi-coloured Schadenfreude. </p> <p>Immediately afterwards, in glorious contrast, <strong> Grand Designs Abroad</strong> introduced us to David and Leonie, who had a budget of \u00a316,000 to build guest rooms for their artists' retreat in Puglia. The result was beautiful and entirely hand-built by the couple and their friends, with 'lots of sweat, a little bit of blood and occasional tears'. There was infinitely more passion and raw humanity in these two ostensibly lightweight, low-budget TV hours than there was in either of the week's big dramas. And that can't be right, can it ?</p>",
  "<p>Kelly Holmes sets off to begin her overdue holidays today after rounding off a season that will live long in the memory with a record-breaking win in the Great North Mile. </p> <p>Holmes, in her first race in England since winning the Olympic 800m and 1500m golds in Athens last month, won in 4min 28.7sec, two seconds under the record time set last year by Sureyya Ayhan of Turkey, the European 1500m champion who beat Holmes into second place. </p> <p>'I was really nervous when I woke up this morning,' Holmes said. 'It was just like a major championship race with so many spectators. I would like to thank everyone, from the bottom of my heart, who has supported me this year.' </p> <p>There was only going to be one winner as Holmes, forcing the pace from the start, was always in control. It was the third time she has won the title in the four years of the competition. Helen Clitheroe finished second in 4:33.4 while the Olympic 5,000m finalist Jo Pavey was third with 4:36.70. </p> <p>The event was a taster for the main event this morning, when almost 50,000 people will line up for the Great North Run from the city centre to South Shields, the largest number for a half-marathon - 13.1 miles - in the world. And all but 30 of them will be doing it just for fun. </p> <p>Other half-marathons exist. San Francisco's dates back to 1977, four years before the first Tyneside race. The 13th world championship is run on Sunday in New Delhi. But the Great North Run is the most popular, numbering 49,000 entrants this year, one of whom will be the 600,000th to finish a course negotiated in the record time of 65min 40sec last year by Paula Radcliffe, who misses the race today. </p> <p>Just after 10am the 30 elite runners, women first, will start, followed by 48,970 amateurs. The route will be lined with a handful of musical attractions, among them the bands Dinosaurs From Hell, The Baghdaddies and Deadbeat Radicals. </p> <p>Fancy dress will be worn. Money will be raised for charity. A good day out will be had by all, among them the four-time Olympic rowing champion Matthew Pinsent, the former jump jockey Richard Dunwoody, celebrity chef and former Rangers footballer Gordon Ramsay, former Tony Blair adviser Alastair Campbell, and a host of actors from the television soap Emmerdale. This is a day for the fun runner rather than the professional. </p> <p>'It's a novelty, fun event that you do once in a while,' says Great Britain's No 1 men's marathon runner, Jon Brown, who was fourth in the past two Olympics. 'I didn't really plan on competing - I didn't think I'd be recovered in time from Athens.' Brown will line up today, though. 'There will probably only be half-a-dozen overseas racers and around 20 from the UK.' </p> <p>He would be surprised if he wins, though. 'I haven't really prepared for it. For a lot of athletes, it is the final fling of a long season. It's not like the marathon. That hammers you to death. Some athletes may run OK today, some might run terrible. </p> <p>'Today is not much of a step up from 10k. That's why the Great North Run is so popular. You've got 50,000 people and you just don't get those numbers for a marathon. It's a long-distance race that appeals to lots of people. The elite part of it is quite insignificant.' </p> <p>This casual perspective is reflected by 2000 Olympic 10,000m silver medallist Sonia O'Sullivan. 'You only really have to do a couple of long runs and you're generally ready. It's a way of keeping your fitness rather than just stopping. And it's good fun to go up there. There's a lot going on over the weekend, with the mile on Saturday and the kids' run. It's a big attraction for all sorts of people which makes it more enjoyable and relaxing for the elite runners.' </p> <p>And by way of a bonus, Holmes is the guest starter and will arrive in an open-topped vehicle with Pinsent.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Sir Bobby Robson has spoken out about his 'bewilderment' at being sacked by Newcastle. Robson, who was fired after Newcastle's first four games of the Premiership season, said yesterday that he remains frustrated that the club's board did not allow his four major summer signings to settle in before dismissing him. </p> <p>Robson, 71, told Des Lynam on Radio Five Live of his dismay at the treatment meted out to him by Newcastle chairman Freddie Shepherd. 'It was a shock to be sacked, I was bewildered,' he said. 'We had qualified for Europe and were looking forward to the new season.' </p> <p>Robson also expressed his annoyance at Shepherd's pre-season announcement that the 2004-05 campaign was to be the manager's last in charge. 'I didn't think it would make much of a difference but I was disappointed that it was announced in the way it was. I felt that the squad was the best we had assembled for many a year.' </p> <p>Robson denied the charge that he was losing control of the dressing room and that the players lacked discipline. </p> <p>'I didn't feel the players were moving away.' he argued. 'It's just newspaper talk that the players weren't with me. Team spirit was good. Maybe there was a bit of self-indiscipline with one or two players away from the club which you always try to remedy.' </p> <p> <strong> Norwich</strong> have released out-of-favour defender Keith Briggs almost two years before his contract was due to end. Right-back Briggs joined for \u00a365,000 from Stockport County in January 2003, but only made five appearances for the first team. </p> <p> <strong> Derby </strong> manager George Burley made two signings ahead of yesterday's game against Wigan, snapping up Poland striker Grzegorz Rasiak on a one-year deal and left-back Jason Talbot on loan from Bolton. </p> <p>Rasiak, 25, had signed a three-year contract with Italian club Siena, but the deal had not been registered meaning the player had remained available as a free agent. </p> <p>Talbot arrives at Pride Park on a one-month deal. Both signings went straight into yesterday's starting line-up. </p> <p> <strong> Watford</strong> are to sign defender James Chambers from West Bromwich in a deal which could eventually be worth more than \u00a3250,000 to Albion. </p> <p>The Championship side will pay an initial \u00a375,000 for the 23-year-old, with a further \u00a375,000 dependent on appearances and another \u00a3100,000 due only if Watford win promotion to the top flight with Chambers in the side. The three-year deal will be sealed tomorrow. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Everyone - except those in the England dressing room - is bellowing out the battle cry 'Bring on the Aussies'. Never mind yesterday's defeat: since Tuesday, when Michael Vaughan's one-day side thrashed Australia at Edgbaston, the pundit and the punter have been salivating about next summer's Ashes series. Who would you rather face, Harmison or McGrath? No contest. Doesn't Flintoff smash it farther than Gilchrist? The Aussies are creaking, while Vaughan's buoyant, relatively young side have yet to reach their peak. </p> <p>But Vaughan, unusually, was determined to play the killjoy after that semi-final victory. 'If we are honest, we are still way behind them [the Australians] in terms of experience and expertise,' he said. Tuesday was a one-off game and there are a lot of deliveries to be bowled 'in the right areas' before the Ashes series commences as autumn approaches next year. </p> <p>Amazingly, we will be kicking our heels next summer until 21 July 2005, which is the first day of the first Test against Australia. There will be the temptation to preview the Ashes series week in, week out for 10 months. We'll try to avoid that. Before next July there is the tour of South Africa, where England have yet to win a series since the hosts' return to the international scene. Then we will have to yawn our way through two Tests against Bangladesh and, even worse, a triangular series with Bangladesh and Australia. We cannot keep 'Freddie' and 'Harmy' permanently on ice until then. </p> <p>It is easy to understand why the captains of both sides refused to read too much into the game on Tuesday. Yet that victory in Birmingham does mean something, even if it took place in an autumnal gale at a half-empty Edgbaston at the back end of English cricket's longest season. They may not admit it, but England cricketers have been humbled so frequently by Australia that plenty of scars remain. Now this batch of players can at least recognise that Australia can be beaten; they are mortal. If you cut them, does the ball not speed for four? </p> <p>As Andrew Strauss, who had never played against Australia before, nervelessly cruised to his half-century without breaking sweat, I wondered whether he realised that those guys in yellow were in fact Australians. But Strauss is a bright bloke. He knew and then amazed me by saying that beating Australia last Tuesday was the highlight of his summer. This from a man who had hit a century at Lord's on his Test debut. That's how much it matters to beat the Aussies, whatever the form of the game. </p> <p>Strauss will not have forgotten his debut, but it seems a long time ago when he was handed his first Test cap on 20 May. Nasser Hussain, that polished TV commentator, was still playing the game and his new mates up in the media centre were all pronouncing sombrely that New Zealand posed a genuine threat. They did in that match, but England's victory at Lord's set the ball rolling for an unprecedented summer of Test success. </p> <p>Seven consecutive wins prompt our fascination about the Ashes series. Add the semi-final victory over Australia and you can understand why the few executives remaining at the England and Wales Cricket Board are purring. This week the ECB's negotiations for the new TV and radio deals for 2006 onwards are taking place. It is not a bad time to be selling cricket. </p> <p>That match against New Zealand at Lord's may be remembered as belonging to Strauss in his first Test, or Hussain in his last. They provided the melodrama: Strauss run out by blinkered old Nass just short of a second century before Hussain, hitherto hardly a Roy of the Rovers figure, cracks a cover drive to reach his century and win the game before announcing his retirement. Not a bad way to go. </p> <p>At the time I thought Hussain might be joined on the sidelines by Ashley Giles. For me, this was Giles's match. With my usual foresight I wrote in these pages: 'Unless he produces something special today [the Sunday when New Zealand were in their second innings] Giles could be condemned to the county circuit for a long time.' He had been humbled in the first innings. As soon as he was tossed the ball, the New Zealanders attacked him disdainfully. He could be allowed only five of the 103 overs they received. He yielded 32 runs. The perception was that anyone but Giles would improve the Test side. </p> <p>On that Sunday, Giles hardly shone, but he survived. Marcus Trescothick, captaining England in Vaughan's remarkably fortuitous absence (if he had been fit, we would not have discovered Strauss), shrewdly tossed Giles the ball early - a much-needed expression of confidence. Over the wicket he bowled and this time the Kiwis decided to sit on him. He settled; there were three middle-order wickets. They could not drop Giles after all. In the last five Tests of the summer he would go on to take 28 wickets. England's supposed weakest link had become a match winner. </p> <p>Giles himself acknowledges the help of Steve Bull, England's sports psychologist. The stubborn faith of Duncan Fletcher and Vaughan must have helped as well. In another era he would have been discarded. His game had transformed by the time he left Trent Bridge after the third victory over New Zealand. At the beginning of the summer he was bowling like Gary Rhodes, by the end he was more like Wilfred. Giles, not Flintoff and Harmison, whom we expected to excel, was the surprising star turn of the summer. </p> <p>Perhaps they would never have dropped him anyway. The treatment of Giles epitomises the approach of the England hierarchy. Trust and loyalty have become key elements. They do not discard anyone easily now; they have faith in their chosen players. Derek Randall and Jack Russell in different eras always adopted the philosophy of 'treat every Test as your last'. The current batch of England players can feel more secure. </p> <p>Recently they stuck with Flintoff and Harmison right through their barren spells to be spectacularly rewarded during the past nine months. When faced with the choice of Mark Butcher or Ian Bell for the winter tour they stuck with Butcher. Loyalty breeds confidence and now places must be earned. So just 15 players were used in this summer's Test series and all of them are comfortable with one another; all celebrate their colleagues' success. They are as close-knit as county sides of old. Indeed England is their side. They seldom play for anyone else. </p> <p>There have not been many 'Duncan days' this summer - the ones when England have performed so ineptly that the coach has to be wheeled out to talk to the press - and that's a blessing for all concerned. Fletcher makes Bernhard Langer and Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson sound like the Two Ronnies. </p> <p>Yet Fletcher deserves credit that he never craves as he hovers in the background. He is the consultant. He gives Vaughan freedom to run the show, thereby enhancing his captain's authority. He never criticises his players publicly. He is the modern style of coach, hardly oozing charisma but self-effacing, superbly organised and capable of instilling discipline with the raising of an eyebrow. Sir Clive may have to wait a while for that job to become available. </p> <p>Now Vaughan leads a side who mirror his own character. His team are at ease with themselves, relaxed and patently enjoying themselves (except, perhaps, for the last hour at the Oval yesterday evening). This could never have happened under Hussain; perhaps it could not have happened without Hussain, who was there, bristling and unsmiling, when the framework was established. Hussain's side became hard to beat. Vaughan's side believe they can beat anyone - except perhaps the Aussies. </p> <p>Against New Zealand, England were victorious even though their opponents notched up 386, 409 and 384 in the first innings of the three Tests. Apart from a blip at Old Trafford, when England started to believe their own publicity for a couple of days, West Indies were steamrollered. The killjoys may say that England have beaten only modest opposition. In the past they have had plenty of trouble trying to do just that. </p> <p>South Africa on their home turf should provide a sterner challenge, but I shall be surprised if England do not return victorious from the Test series next February. Flintoff and Harmison may be Vaughan's jewels, but the strength of his side is now that the supposed weakest links, the plain Janes of the bowling attack, Giles and Matthew Hoggard, have found a way to prosper at the highest level. </p> <p>Moreover, England now have seven batsmen they can happily toss into their Test team (the six who are destined for South Africa plus Bell). I do not think South Africa possess the same depth of talent. Australia do. But for the moment, Vaughan and his men are right to let everyone else speculate about that. </p> <p> <strong>Results</strong></p> <p><strong> Test series v New Zealand</strong> <br> First Test (Lord's) Won by 7 wickets <br>Second Test (Headingley) Won by 9 wickets <br>Third Test (Trent Bridge) Won by 4 wickets </p> <p><strong> One-day Triangular series</strong> <br> v New Zealand (Old Trafford) Match abandoned <br>v West Indies (Trent Bridge) Lost by 7 wickets <br>v New Zealand (Riverside) Lost by 7 wickets <br> v West Indies (Headingley) Won by 7 wickets <br> v New Zealand (Bristol) Lost by 6 wickets <br>v West Indies (Lord's) Lost by 7 wickets </p> <p><strong> Test series v West Indies</strong> <br> First Test (Lord's) Won by 210 runs <br>Second Test (Edgbaston) Won by 256 runs <br> Third Test (Old Trafford) Won by 7 wickets <br> Fourth Test (The Oval) Won by 10 wickets </p> <p><strong> One-day series v India</strong> <br> First ODI (Trent Bridge) Won by 7 wickets <br>Second ODI (Trent Bridge) Won by 70 runs <br> Third ODI (Lord's) Lost by 23 runs</p> <p> <strong> ICC Champions Trophy</strong> <br> v Zimbabwe (Edgbaston) Won by 152 runs <br>v Sri Lanka (Rose Bowl) Won by 49 runs <br> v Australia (Edgbaston) Won by 6 wickets <br> v West Indies (The Oval) Lost by 2 wickets </p> <p> <strong> Fixtures</strong></p> <p> <strong> One-day series v Zimbabwe</strong> <br> Fri 26 November (Harare) <br> Sun 28 November (Harare) <br> Wed 1 December (Bulawayo) <br> Sat 4 December (Bulawayo) <br>Sun 5 December (Bulawayo) </p> <p><strong> Test series v South Africa</strong> <br> Fri 17-Tue 21 December First Test (Port Elizabeth) <br> Sun 26-Thur 30 December Second Test (Durban) <br> Thur 2-Mon 6 January 2005 Third Test (Cape Town) <br>Mon 13-Fri 17 January Fourth Test (Johannesburg) <br>Tue 21-Sat 25 January Fifth Test (Centurion) </p> <p><strong> One-day series v South Africa</strong> <br> Sun 30 January (Johannesburg) <br>Wed 2 February (Bloemfontein) <br>Fri 4 February (Port Elizabeth) <br>Sun 6 February (Cape Town <br>) Wed 9 February (East London) <br> Fri 11 February (Durban) <br>Sun 13 February (Centurion) </p> <p><strong> Test series v Bangladesh</strong> <br> Thur 26-Mon 30 May First Test (Lord's) <br> Fri 3-Tue 7 June Second Test (Riverside) </p> <p><strong> Twenty20 v Australia</strong> <br> Mon 13 June (Rose Bowl) </p> <p><strong> One-day Triangular series</strong> <br> Thur 16 June (The Oval) v Bangladesh <br> Sun 19 June (Bristol) v Australia <br>Tue 21 June (Trent Bridge) v Bangladesh <br> Thur 23 June (Riverside) v Australia <br>Sun 26 June (Headingley) v Bangladesh <br>Tue 28 June (Edgbaston) v Australia</p> <p> <strong> One-day series v Australia</strong> <br> Thur 7 July (Headingley) <br>Sun 10 July (Lord's) <br>Tue 12 July (The Oval)</p> <p> <strong> Test series v Australia</strong> <br> Thur 21-Mon 25 July First Test (Lord's) <br>Thur 4-Mon 8 August Second Test (Edgbaston) <br>Thur 11-Mon 15 August Third Test (Old Traffotrd) <br>Thur 25-Mon 29 August Fourth Test (Trent Bridge) <br> Thur 8-Mon 12 September Fifth Test (The Oval) </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>It was pitch-black out on the field when this match came to its sensational climax at 6.36pm with an astonishing West Indies victory by two wickets. Moments later it must have been dark as thunder in the England dressing room. They will never have a better chance of winning a one-day trophy of international significance. </p> <p>The target they set was modest, 217, but when the West Indies were 147 for eight, those spectators eager to warm themselves up with an early ride on the tube, looked to be the wise ones. Enter two stout, barely known West Indians, Courtney Browne and Ian Bradshaw, stalwarts of the Barbados team. </p> <p>By now the light was already going. Michael Vaughan tossed the ball to Steve Harmison. They resisted; Browne even slashed him to the off-side boundary. Vaughan tried Andrew Flintoff, but this cagey pair knew that his overs were running out; they survived. And they knew that there were runs to be gleaned from the other bowlers. </p> <p>Vaughan had opted not to look to Ashley Giles, the arch tormentor of West Indies in the Test series. He must regret that now. Instead, with unusual reluctance he turned to Darren Gough. For Gough had a nightmarish day - out first ball and exposed when bowling. West Indies targeted him and Gough could do nothing about it. This maybe his last match and what a galling way to go. </p> <p>Forty-seven off 10 overs became 24 off five and soon they cantered home. A slashing square drive from Bradshaw sped to the point boundary. The England fieldsmen stood like statues, not just in despair. I doubt whether they could see the ball. </p> <p>So England were undone not by Chris Gayle or Ramnaresh Sarwan or Brian Lara, but by a discarded old wicketkeeper and a creaking left-arm seamer. They remained calmness personified as an unlikely run-chase developed into a reality. That's how Barbados have been playing for several seasons, but we do not expect such deeds from West Indies. </p> <p>Bradshaw, the man of the match, and Browne were the heroes, but this result may well help to transform West Indian cricket. It certainly strengthens Lara's hold on the captaincy. They could hardly ditch him now. Indeed Lara was inspirational. </p> <p>'Beware Lara' has been a common theme in team talks around the world. Beforehand England's think-tank would have given much attention to Lara the batsman, who had been felled by Shoaib Akhtar in the semi-final. They may have detailed Harmison or Flintoff to pepper him. There would have been no mention of Lara the fielder. </p> <p>Yet it was in the field that Lara tilted this final in the direction of West Indies. He's 35 now. During the Test series he strolled casually to first slip, for much of the time giving the impression that fielding was a necessary chore. Here he skipped around at midwicket like a young stallion just turned out to pasture. Maybe the chance to restore West Indies' pride and to reassert his right to the captaincy spurred him on; maybe it was the decision of the team to dedicate this game to the victims of the Caribbean hurricanes. Maybe it was the bang on the head from Shoaib. For whatever reason, Lara was a man transformed. </p> <p>In all he had a hand in four England wickets. Moreover his unaccustomed zeal infected his colleagues. Earlier in the summer West Indies were woefully lacklustre. Here they dived, harried and parried for the 49.4 overs that they required to dismiss England. </p> <p>One of Lara's interventions was critical. So you can guess that it involved Flintoff. England were stuttering at 93 for three and the young champion had just arrived at the crease as Wavell Hinds bowled his first delivery. It was just short of a length. Flintoff rocked on to the back foot and pulled the ball from the meat of his bat to midwicket. So it was travelling. Lara instinctively stuck out his left hand and that is where the ball lodged a couple of inches above the ground. Once he realised that the ball was in his hand he was as animated as he has ever been on a cricket field. It was a miraculous catch. </p> <p>The value of the early dismissal of Flintoff is incalculable. Lara's intervention to dismiss Marcus Trescothick was more easily measured. It must have reduced West Indies' victory target by 15 to 20 runs. Trescothick had hit his eighth one-day century for England, a mature innings, superbly paced given that he was denied any significant support until the arrival of Ashley Giles. </p> <p>This time Lara swooped unerringly on the ball and flicked a return to the bowler, Gayle, before Trescothick could regain his ground. As a result England's tail were incapable of wagging in the last two-and-a-half overs. </p> <p>Without the subdued brilliance of Trescothick, West Indies' victory would have lacked the final melodrama in dank, wintry conditions. The drizzle set in, yet there was a determination among both sets of players and the umpires not to let this season be prolonged any further. Had this been a Test match barely a ball would have been bowled. </p> <p>Upon winning the toss Lara, for a change, did the obvious thing and it was only during a seventh-wicket stand of 63, when Giles joined forces with Trescothick, that West Indies' control was threatened. </p> <p>Bradshaw soon accounted for Vikram Solanki and Vaughan. Andrew Strauss, attempting to sneak a single, was brilliantly run out by Dwayne Bravo, following through in his run-up. Once a flabbergasted Flintoff had departed, Paul Collingwood's reputation for pragmatism was dented as he heaved at Hinds, the surprise package of the West Indies attack. Jones could do no better so it was left to Giles to lend support to Trescothick. </p> <p>This was Trescothick's third consecutive major contribution in this tournament. There were few of his forays down the pitch. The game was too important and his colleagues were looking too fragile for such extravagances. Trescothick had given the England bowlers a chance. </p> <p>Clearly those bowlers were charged for the task. Maybe Gough was over-motivated. His first two deliveries were wides as he strained for extra pace. We kept expecting him to atone for such a ropey start. He could not do it. </p> <p>Harmison was a different proposition. Soon Hinds sliced a drive to cover, to bring in Sarwan, the man of the tournament. Sarwan departed to probably the second best catch of the tournament - it did not quite match Lara's, but Strauss's diving effort at second slip was stunning. </p> <p>Now West Indies tried to meet fire with fire. A limping Gayle cracked two boundaries off Harmison. Inevitably he sought a third. He almost middled a pull shot back to the bowler, who caught it with some nonchalance. </p> <p>Lara threatened, but again it was Flintoff, who won their duel. A flat-footed drive was edged to the keeper and England's scent of victory grew stronger as only Shivnarine Chanderpaul of the batsmen offered much resistance. Enter Browne and Bradshaw to remove the icing from England's cake. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>The temptation for gags, as Harry Redknapp put a bulldog puppy blessed with uncannily natural ball control through her paces at Portsmouth's training ground, was irresistible. You could imagine Pompey's manager finishing the session and meandering over for an impromptu press conference to introduce his latest signing. 'Well, you know, she's got the kind of strength and aggression that would be a real addition to the squad, especially with us being down to the bare bones.' </p> <p>In fact, probably for the first time in Redknapp's managerial career, his 'bare bones' catchphrase is redundant. The size of his squad, which has over the years been the subject of many an ode to moaning, is something he is reasonably happy with. He has options. Competition for places. Choices. The prospect of players banging on his door demanding to know why they are not in the side makes him break out into a grin. 'I've never had that before!' he cackles. 'It'll be a nice problem to have.' </p> <p>Strength in depth instils confidence in his team and their ability to attain the season's objective: survival. So positively did Portsmouth contribute to the Premiership last term that it is easy to forget that they were, as a newly promoted side on a meagre budget, favourites for automatic relegation. </p> <p>Redknapp sympathises with this season's newcomers who between them before this weekend endured 18 games without a single win. 'I wouldn't write them off, but I'll be honest: much as I love Iain Dowie, I think he's got it all on to keep Crystal Palace up, and if he does he should get manager of the year,' he says. 'Norwich and West Brom, who have had a go by spending \u00a312million, have got a better chance, but it's going to be tight. It's going to be a scrap for a dozen teams until you get that magic 40 points on the board. There is no danger of us being complacent. You've only got to look at Ipswich when they came up. What a year they had finishing fifth and the following year they were relegated.' </p> <p>He is mindful of how relegation would shatter the upward spiral Portsmouth have enjoyed since he and Jim Smith arrived two-and-a-half years ago. 'Like most clubs when you go down it is very, very difficult to get back. Look at clubs like West Ham, who attract 30,000 people every week. Look at Leicester, Wolves, Sunderland. These are all big clubs with great stadiums. Looking at the names in that division is good motivation for us.' </p> <p>A flurry of signings before the start of the season adds to the feeling that Portsmouth are healthy enough to emulate last season's 13th-place finish. Redknapp is particularly excited to have strengthened his strike force and now boasts four young, hungry attackers, who he expects to improve under coach Joe Jordan. They could have worse tutors than a Scottish warrior steeped in the goalscoring arts, and a man so keen to make a difference he was last off the training pitch after a few extra laps. </p> <p>Diomansy Kamara and Ricardo Fuller have impressed already. 'Kamara is settling in well and he's a real talent,' Redknapp says. 'It might sound silly and I don't want to put him under pressure by pinning this on him, but when you look at the way he moves he's the nearest thing I've seen to Thierry Henry. I'm not saying he's in Henry's class, but he glides across the ground with fantastic pace. He could be a real good player. Fuller is a handful with good ability on the ball, and it's nice to think I've got them in addition to Lomano LuaLua, who can tear the backside off anyone on his day, and Aiyegbeni whose 19 goals last season was a fantastic total. I thought we were going to lose Yak in the summer when Boro came in, but thankfully that didn't happen. He's still a kid and he's got a big future.' </p> <p>With seven goals in their last two home games, there are great expectations at Fratton Park. This afternoon they will aim to break down an Everton side whose flying start to the season has caught everyone by surprise. </p> <p>Redknapp admires the way Everton and Bolton are carrying the flag for the Premiership's relatively impoverished, but has his doubts that they can break into the establishment. 'Everton came into the weekend third, which shows what a marvellous start to the season they've had, but David Moyes will know they've got no chance of finishing in the top three. It's impossible. The top three of Arsenal, Chelsea and Man United are on another level completely; after that you've got Liverpool and Newcastle. That will be the top five again. After that,' he adds, glint in his eye, 'it's anyone from anywhere.' </p> <p>If there is anything limiting the possibility of that being Portsmouth, it's their defence. Redknapp may not have much to grumble about, but he is entitled to mention that he's 'a bit short at the back'. Over the summer he tried another transfer coup by courting Marcel Desailly. Talks went well, but the World Cup winner decided to rest his limbs and take up a television contract. Redknapp is still on the lookout for a sturdy defender. </p> <p>Now, where's that bulldog? </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The rights of the concubine have thrown Hong Kong's courts into confusion as lawyers try to resolve a battle between an ageing property tycoon and his partner of 46 years. <p>Lim Por-yen, 90, claims he lent around \u00a341 million to his former concubine Koo Siu-ying, 66, in a series of 60 payments between 1994 and 2001. Now he wants it back, plus an extra \u00a332m in interest charged on the loans. </p> <p>Koo claims the money - used for a Shanghai property project - was a gift, and she was his 'third wife'. </p> <p>Concubinage - where men were entitled to have more than one wife - was not abolished until 1971 in Hong Kong. Concubines in an established relationship before that are still acknowledged, although the extent of their legal rights has not been tested until now. </p> <p>At the centre of the Lim and Koo case is whether a concubine should be treated as a wife, acceptable under Chinese tradition but alien to the former colony's British legal system, which is based on monogamous marriage. </p> <p>Koo says the couple were married in 1956 when Lim announced at a dinner that she was his 'third wife'. Lim already had one wife and one concubine at the time. </p> <p>The couple had two children and lived together for 46 years until they separated in 2002. Koo claims Lim's family accepted her and that they were widely recognised as husband and wife. Therefore money given to her by Lim is a gift - the same presumption existing in law for marriage. </p> <p>Koo says that in the 1990s she wanted to emigrate to the US or Europe but Lim persuaded her to stay by giving her the money to invest in the Shanghai property project. Lim disagrees that the couple were ever married and took further legal action to try and prevent Koo's lawyers from describing her as his 'third wife'. </p> <p>In December he scored a victory when the court ruled the couple's status was irrelevant to the case. The real issue was whether the money was a loan or a gift under contract law, said Justice Muttrie, adding: 'There are men who, having vowed in a Church of England marriage ceremony \"With all my worldly goods I thee endow\", or its modern equivalent, will not give their wives a cent. There are men who will give their mistresses a fortune and never expect it back. No doubt the same applies in all cultures and religions.' </p> <p>But last week an appeal court overruled that judgment, putting the legal status of concubines back on the agenda and allowing Koo her 'third wife' status. </p> <p>Appeal court judge Anthony Rogers said: 'The question of whether a husband should look after a concubine... is obviously a matter which needs to be finally determined.' </p> <p>Koo's Shanghai company was taken to court by a Hong Kong bank to order the repayment of the firm's overdraft, while in 1999 Lim was sentenced to three years in jail after being found guilty of bribing Taiwanese officials over a multi-million dollar land deal. He is appealing against the verdict and has yet to serve time behind bars.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Informal talks best way to get promised pay rate</strong></p> <p>I work for an organisation that pays higher rates in the job I do if you have a particular qualification. Before I joined, I was sent a letter saying I would get the higher rate, as I have the qualification. But when the contract arrived, it was for the lower level. </p> <p>I rang the HR department, who expressed surprise at this but gave the impression that it was a clerical error that could easily be corrected later. I signed the contract because there would have been a delay in my start date otherwise. My employer is now refusing to pay the salary increase. It gets the money from an outside funding agency that has said it will not pay. Can you advise? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You do have some rights in law - but they do not greatly improve your position in practice. </p> <p>It is possible for the terms of a written employment contract to be overridden by arrangements agreed in a conversation. So, in theory, your overall contract could mean that you are due the higher rate. But some written employment contracts exclude this possibility by including a clause saying that they represent the entirety of the employment agreement and will overrule any agreements made orally. Look carefully at your contract, or you might want to take it to a solicitor. </p> <p>Assuming that your employ ment contract does not contain such a clause, the situation then is that your employer is in breach of contract for paying you less than the amount agreed. If it will not pay the higher rate, you could resign and take a claim against it in court. (You could not go the unfair dismissal route as you have not been there a year, the qualifying period for this.) But the most you would get through a court would be the difference between the two rates for the period you worked there and your notice period. (This is because the organisation could fairly dismiss you if it did not have the funding for the higher rate.) </p> <p>If you stay working there for more than a few months, you will be deemed by your behaviour to have accepted the lower pay rate. </p> <p>If you want to keep your job, then informal negotiation may be the best route, both with the person who sent you the original letter and with your HR department. Is there a chance, perhaps, that the funding agency would review the situation? It would be interesting to get the view of your trade union, which might be able to exert moral pressure and to fight your corner.</p> <p><strong>Redundancy offer is best you will get</strong></p> <p>I'm being declared redundant, but my pay-off is much lower than a friend received from his company. What are my rights? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In short, employees are entitled to the statutory minimum (which is not very generous) unless they are covered by a redundancy policy with their particular employer through which they will be paid more.</p> <p>So, if you are only entitled to the statutory minimum, you get a week's pay for each year of service you have clocked up under the age of 41. Older workers get 1.5 weeks of pay for each year of service after their 41st birthday. The particularly bad news is that the week's pay is capped at \u00a3270. (And if any of your years of service occurred when you were 21 or under, you get just half a week's pay per year of service for that period.) But many employers are more sympa thetic than this to employees who lose their jobs through redundancy. It is not unusual to find organisations offering one month's pay, uncapped, for each year of service.</p> <p>You do not have any kind of extra claim if your employer has complied with statutory requirements and with its own policies. The amounts paid by another employer are irrelevant here.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Legal advice from Law For All (020 8758 0668) and Human and Legal Resources</p>",
  "<p>When HBOS decided to scrap its plans to bid for Abbey National, it killed stone dead any lingering hope of mergers among the major UK banks. Quite simply, the regulatory risk is too high. True, for about a month it looked as if HBOS and several other big banks would fight for control of Abbey, which has agreed a merger with Santander of Spain.</p> <p>But after much soul-searching, not to mention risk analysis, Britain's financial juggernauts realised that nothing had really changed since Lloyds TSB was prevented by the Competition Commission from bidding for Abbey in 2001. </p> <p>The implications are enormous, as we discovered last week when Barclays Bank announced plans to buy a majority stake in Absa, one of South Africa's largest institutions. </p> <p>Commentators were transfixed by the historic symbolism. Nearly 20 years ago, the bank bowed to pressure from anti-apartheid campaigners and withdrew from South Africa; now it is returning, albeit to a very different country. But the commercial and strategic significance flows directly from HBOS's decision to withdraw from the battle for Abbey. HBOS underlined the reality that regulatory restrictions mean British banks must look abroad for growth. </p> <p>For years, analysts thought that mergers would be more likely in Europe, but Abbey and Santander aside, the Continent is a tricky place for British banks to do business. The cultural, economic and social differences should not be underestimated. It is far easier to cut deals in the US, as Sir John Bond of HSBC has already illustrated, or Ireland and Australia, where HBOS is now looking to expand. Or South Africa, for that matter. Of course, deals between English-speaking companies cut both ways: it is much easier for Citigroup to consider gobbling up Lloyds TSB or Barclays than to venture into Europe, where there are strict employment laws and government opposition to foreign takeovers. </p> <p>I suspect that UK banking consolidation will predominantly be a game played by companies that share the same mother tongue for the foreseeable future.</p> <p><strong>BE's shareholders should blow a fuse</strong></p> <p>Something sticks in the craw about Adrian Montague's decision to apply for nuclear power company British Energy to be delisted from the London Stock Exchange. Usually such action is taken with the full approval of shareholders. </p> <p>But in the case of BE, chairman Montague's motive is to sabotage an attempt by investors to seek better terms from a rescue plan that the company hammered out with creditors last year. As I report on page five, Montague has even threatened the company with insolvency.</p> <p>If British Energy is removed from the market, shareholders have few rights, so Montague reckons he is onto a good thing. But American investment groups Brandes and Polygon beg to differ and have secured enough support to call a special meeting where their proposals can be voted on by all shareholders. If Montague gets his way, that poll will be scrapped.</p> <p>Montague argues that his move was essential to protect the rescue plan. As the government is the biggest creditor of BE, there is no doubt that he was under pressure to take the action he did. But that doesn't make it right. I believe that the terms of the rescue agreement can be revised to ensure that shareholders get a better deal, whatever Montague says. And it is nonsense to argue that there is no commercial future for BE unless control passes to the bondholders and the government.</p> <p>Even with \u00a33.4 billion of decommissioning costs, BE could have been recapitalised via a large rescue rights issue of new shares. Now that electricity prices are soaring, and there is talk of a bigger role for nuclear as oil and gas supplies look more precarious than ever, Montague has missed a trick.</p> <p>From my own informal soundings, many investors would have put up fresh capital furnishing BE with cash and the opportunity to pay off the bondholders in full. Admittedly, BE is a complicated case, but if Montague wins, it will be a sad day for shareholder activism, a cause that this government has gone out of its way to champion in the past.</p> <p><strong>Vodafone makes heavy weather of 3G roll-out</strong></p> <p>Vodafone is spending about \u00a3100m rolling out its third generation mobile phone services, but the shares hardly moved. Clearly we need more than a fanfare of publicity to be convinced that the project will justify the \u00a36 billion Vodafone paid for its 3G licence five years ago. </p> <p>The company, headed by Arun Sarin, will from November sell 10 different types of 3G phone, but the bad news is that the handsets are heavier than those currently on offer. That may not put off consumers anxious to tap into the new hi-tech services, but it is hardly a selling point. Over time, of course, the phones will become lighter as the technology is finessed, but will 3G live up to its promise?</p> <p>There are a few encouraging signs. A mole tells me that 3, owned by Hong Kong group Hutchison Whampoa, finds punters are spending far more on 3 music clips, computer games and the like than originally forecast. DoComo in Japan says the same. But these are early days, and the industry has much to prove - Vodafone in particular as the industry bellwether and one of the largest companies listed on the London market.</p> <p>Since it failed to acquire AT&amp;T Wireless earlier this year, the company has gone to ground, and there has been little transparency about its plans. This week Sarin is meeting investors to try to restore confidence. Let's hope the briefings amount to more than lofty statements of intent and corporate spin.</p> <p><strong>It 'as to be Norman</strong></p> <p>Sir Ken Morrison, boss of Wm Morrison, is having an awful time trying to integrate Safeway. May I suggest he enlists Archie Norman, former boss of Asda? I hear Norman, Tory MP for Tunbridge Wells, is tiring of life on the backbenches, and would relish another challenge. </p> <p>Admittedly, he might not jump at the idea of playing second fiddle to Morrison. But the Yorkshireman is in his seventies and with no obvious heir in sight. Norman would surely be a worthy successor.</p>",
  "<p>What have bicycles to do with computer security? Answer: more than you'd think. Many geeks like bikes, especially high-performance, sophisticated ones. Since these are expensive, that means that geeks also take a keen interest in bicycle security. After all, there's no point in having a $1,000 bike and securing it with a $5 lock. </p> <p>For years, the premier bike locks in the US have been made by a company called Kryptonite (motto: 'Tough World, Tough Locks') named, we must presume, after the only substance that could defeat Superman. Kryptonite's premier product was the Evolution 2000, a D-lock tubular cylinder device. </p> <p>One proud owner of an Evolution 2000 was Chris Brennan, a San Francisco-based computer security consultant, who was dismayed to find that it did not prevent the theft of his bike. He mentioned the theft to a friend, who gave him one of those 'you-mean-you-haven't-heard' looks. Having picked himself off the floor, Brennan then posted a message last Sunday on bikeforums.net, a bulletin board for bike enthusiasts. </p> <p>'As you guys might remember,' he wrote, 'I recently had the nicest set of wheels I've ever had stolen from me. Today I was hanging out with a friend and we got to talking about that - he said his friend showed him just recently how to open a U-Lock with a ballpoint pen. Of course I didn't believe it. That is until just 30 seconds ago when I opened my own Kryptonite Evolution 2000 with a Bic ballpoint pen! This has to be the most absurd thing I've ever seen. Try it. Take the end off the pen, jam it in the lock, wiggle around and twist.' </p> <p>Now the funny thing is that this was apparently an old story. According to bikebiz.co.uk, the vulnerability of this particular type of lock was first described in a British bicycle magazine in 1992 - and allegedly even reported on the BBC. Five weeks ago, Marc Tobias, a lawyer and security consultant who takes an interest in these matters, posted news of the vulnerability on his (commercial) website - pointing out that all locks using an axial pin tumbler could be easily compromised with a pen or a toilet-paper tube. This applies also, he claimed, to certain laptop-security products marketed by Kensington, Targus and Compucage. </p> <p>But it was Brennan's message on bikeforums.net that triggered the avalanche. According to the site's webmaster, it was read by more than 400,000 people. Someone made a video of the ballpoint trick and it was downloaded more than three million times. All in the space of a few days. </p> <p>The impact on Kryptonite can be imagined. One day it was doing a nice business, with products that were regarded as the Rolls-Royce of the industry (someone described them as 'the Microsoft of the bike lock industry', but that was grossly unfair - to Kryptonite). The next day, it's in terminal trouble, with shops all over the US withdrawing its products from their shelves, its switchboard jammed, its website buckling under the load, and mainstream media such as the New York Times and Boston Globe weighing in with massive coverage. And of course there was the small matter of Kryptonite's guarantee to purchasers of its New York line of locks - if a bicycle was stolen by someone who broke the lock, Kryptonite would pay up to $3,500 to replace the bike. </p> <p>There are some instructive general lessons to be drawn from this little episode. </p> <p>The first is for company executives: if you screw up badly, then the world will know - and there's nothing you can do about it. The good old bad old days - when duff or unsafe products could be sold for years before some law enforcement or customer standards authority acted - are gone for good. And because of the net, it can happen in a week. </p> <p>Second, sunlight is the best disinfectant. Some people questioned whether Brennan was right to publicise the vulnerability of Kryptonite locks. Why tell the world - isn't that just encouraging thievery? The same whinge is regularly heard from software companies, banks and other agencies whose computer systems have security flaws. They always want to silence those who seek to expose the problems. </p> <p>The solution is the same for both bikes and computers. Openness is the best policy, because it alerts consumers and forces companies to address the problems created by their products. </p> <p>In Kryptonite's case, if it's true that the vulnerability had been in the public domain since 1992, why didn't the company do something about it in the intervening period? In Microsoft's case, why did it take it so long to have the firewall switched on by default in Windows XP? </p> <p>Meanwhile, faced with this corporate indolence, what should the hapless consumer do? Answer: cyclists should ride cheap, battered bikes that nobody would want to steal. And computer users should break the Windows habit.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/\">www.briefhistory.com/footnotes</a></p>",
  "<p>Scissor Sisters are midway through their set and, having identified Paris Hilton as emblematic of everything that's wrong with America, firecracker frontwoman Ana Matronic is now cursing the twisted values of Wal-Mart. The \u00fcber-retailer refuses to stock the band's self-titled album, on account of lyrical use of the words \"tits\" and \"shit\", but it will happily sell guns with which customers can mow down playgrounds of children. The crowd whoops with approval at Matronic's sweary remonstrations, then Scissor Sisters launch into another of the anthemic pop songs for which, along with polemic and performance, they've become famous. The audience - from skinny fashion kids to tops-off muscle marys, East Village arty types to middle-aged couples with matching Elton John tour T-shirts - dance in the pouring New York summer rain. </p> <p>An hour earlier, and the band are relaxing in the green room. In the corridor, there is a commotion. A group of people - mostly women and wholly beautiful - approaches. This is not simply a group, though: this is an entourage. There is Someone here. </p> <p>The Someone is Bono. With a space in his schedule between glad-handing presidents and raising awareness of pressing global issues, he has popped in to watch the gig and say hello. Not just hello, of course: he also says Scissor Sisters are the best pop band in the world. They take this in their unusually-trousered stride. It's what happens now in Scissor Sister world. In the year since their cover of Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb was first released in the UK, the lives of Jake Shears, Ana Matronic, Babydaddy, Del Marquis and Paddy Boom have undergone a remarkable transformation. Their rise, from singing along to CDs in shabby-chic New York clubs to, next month, playing a sellout gig at the Royal Albert Hall, is staggeringly steep. And maybe because Shears and Babydaddy are horror film fans, it reminds you of that bit in The Silence Of The Lambs when Hannibal Lecter charts the ascent of Agent Starling, \"Getting out, getting anywhere, getting all the way to the FBI.\" </p> <p>At home in the US, they are relatively unknown beyond New York, but here Scissor Sisters are ubiquitous, you hear their record constantly in high street fashion stores. This is nothing new: there's a history of more alternative US bands making their name in the UK first - Blondie, for example. British audiences seem more willing to embrace the different and the distinctive. It helps that our music isn't as rigidly compartmentalised as America's where the dominant genres of rap, rock and country are very fixed. There's also a more cynical theory: record labels like to use the UK as a test market for new indie bands because it's cheaper here. The payoff is that British buzz is worth more than US word of mouth. </p> <p>And there has been a buzz. Scissor Sisters are good: amid manufactured pop, misanthropic rap and dull rock, they stand out as honest, different and, say it quietly, authentic. \"The radio is full of liars, blatantly dishonest people who don't care about what they're doing,\" says Babydaddy. \"They see celebrity as an end in itself. We care about what we're doing. Our goals aren't contrived. We put out something that makes sense to people. But the big trouble with getting dressed up like we do is that a lot of people think we're some kitschy throwback to the 70s, and they ignore the music. I would hope that people would listen and realise we're not that at all.\" </p> <p>Bizarrely, the band has been compared to the Village People. This is partly due to rock nerds' outrage at the Comfortably Numb cover, as well as homophobia in the music press, where there's a suspicion of bands not consisting of angst-ridden, greasy-haired, guitar-wielding indie kids. Especially one without a definite article in its name (as opposed to, say, The Thrills, The Von Bondies, The Strokes and The White Stripes). But the absence of a \"the\" makes a point, one concerning inclusivity. As Shears says of their gigs, \"There's no hierarchy. The only reason the stage is five feet off the ground is so that everyone can see us. We're all there together to have a good time. It's all one room.\" Matronic succinctly tells an audience in Brighton, \"We are Scissor Sisters and so are you.\" </p> <p>It's the antithesis of the macho posturing of cock rock, and it works. They have sold just shy of one million albums and made the summer festivals their own, attracting the largest crowd at V and wowing Glastonbury twice. They appeal to a young, urban, stylish crowd and a more MOR set, blending disco glitter with dance music exuberance, the energy of punk with classic songwriting. Older musicians are keen to court them - it's a demonstration that their fingers are still on the pulse. Before Bono's blessing, they were anointed by Elton John, who was savvy enough to invite them to support him on tour. Scissor Sisters' Take Your Mama Out has been compared to Elton's funky 70s oeuvre. Kylie has also lured them into the studio. (By now, you may have spotted a queer sensibility and, yes, Shears, Babydaddy and Marquis are gay, while Matronic has described herself as a drag queen trapped in a woman's body. In fact, Boom, the drummer, is the only straight man.) </p> <p>The songwriting partnership of Shears and Babydaddy is the fulcrum of Scissor Sisters. They're not coupley or fraternal, but they share an intimacy. Like Rodgers and Hammerstein and Lennon and McCartney, their partnership produces an alchemy. Going into the studio is, says Shears, \"food for the soul\". Babydaddy says it's Shears who writes most of the lyrics. \"Sometimes we start with a musical idea of mine, or a lyrical or melodical idea of his - it just depends.\" Shears has an affinity to pop that he's passed on to Babydaddy. \"It's something that comes really naturally to him - wanting to have the big exploding chorus.\" Shears - who is a tornado of energy, one of those people for whom the world doesn't spin fast enough - agrees that the magic songs just come: \"It happens in just one moment. A song like Laura just came out - I just sang it. It's instinct or something; I don't necessarily think you're in control, and the songs I really love are the ones I don't even feel like I've written.\" Shears says he hates getting all new age, but making music is \"a spiritual thing\", euphoric. </p> <p>Babydaddy is responsible for the lush sound, a feat all the more impressive when you know that the record was created in his tiny home studio in Brooklyn. In public at least, he is diffident about the achievement. \"I haven't listened to the album too much since we finished it, and when I do hear it I wonder how it sounds to other people. To me, it's a very primitively made album, a polished turd. We turned sounds that were imperfectly recorded on cheap equipment into something unique. I want to keep doing it that way - I have a fear of coming into money for production. I think money ruins artists. I am a huge fan of Tim Burton, but the second he got big budgets, he ceased being interesting to me. There's something about the struggle that gives art its own life.\" </p> <p>As is often the way with ubiquitous things, Scissor Sisters' music may now be regarded as d\u00e9class\u00e9 in certain circles, but if you only listen, it's brilliant, bumptious - full of razor-sharp hooks, sublime lyrics and soaring choruses. </p> <p>Babydaddy and Shears met when Shears was 18, through a mutual friend who took him to visit Babydaddy in Lexington, Kentucky, his home town. \"He saw my mom's immaculately clean kitchen and got a bit frightened - as people usually do,\" says Babydaddy. They bonded over horror films and video games, and, months later, Babydaddy visited Shears at home in Seattle. \"He showed me Valley Of The Dolls, which freaked me out. And he had a full-time hooker staying with him at the time.\" </p> <p>Nothing out of the way there. Shears, born Jason Sellards, had an unusual childhood. He had his first gay relationship at 13 and came out to his parents in Las Vegas (as good a place as any, I imagine) two years later. He lived away from home for a time and had a terrible time at state school - he wore make-up and dresses, and became a target for the hatred of his mostly Mormon classmates. \"I don't know what I was thinking,\" he says of his early exit from the closet. \"I probably wouldn't recommend it to every gay 15-year-old, but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\" </p> <p>Stronger then, Shears transferred to a private school (\"Somewhere where I could be who I was and not be scared\"), where his creativity flourished. He was \"heavily into books\", and filled stacks of jotters and notebooks with poetry and prose. Leaving school, he ventured to LA and dabbled in filmmaking, but hated it. New York beckoned. \"I knew if I hated LA, I'd love New York, and I did, but it was really challenging for a long time. I was living in a really scary place [upstairs from a crack den]. I was on the pay phone on the corner telling my mom everything was all right when I was terrified. But in New York, you can't just throw your hands up and say, 'Things aren't going well, I'm leaving.' Well, you can, but that's why you're not cut out for New York. You have to stick with it.\" </p> <p>And stick with it he did. Go-go dancing in an East Village gay bar, Shears' penchant for performing was apparent. By this time, Babydaddy (real name Scot Hoffman) was at university in the city and the pair hooked up. They had plans to organise a club night where every month they'd perform a new song. The night never came about, but they did perform at other clubs on other nights, with Shears sometimes dressed as an abortion. This is when Scissor Sisters were born, emerging from Manhattan's electroclash scene. Electroclash was a new strain of dance music that took in the androgynous, debauched electro pop excess of the early 80s and married it to the musical advances of the techno age - it's a fair classification of Scissor Sisters' early work on bijou New York label A Touch Of Class. One of the seminal electroclash records (along with Fischerspooner's Emerge, Tiga's Sunglasses At Night and Miss Kittin's Frank Sinatra), Comfortably Numb was originally the b-side of Electrobix, a song about gym obsession and body dysmorphia among gay men. But the razzmatazz surrounding electroclash always outstripped the talent involved. Judiciously, Scissor Sisters extricated themselves from the scene, which soon withered. Their scorn for fashionability and their desire to appeal to a mainstream audience saved them from the fate suffered by the likes of Fischerspooner who, through little fault of their own, were crushed under the weight of hype. In truth, Scissor Sisters were bigger than the scene from whence they came. </p> <p>One of those other nights at which Shears and Babydaddy pitched up was organised by one Ana Matronic. The theme was \"origami orgy\", and the song they performed had \"a bit of a weird Asian sound to it that we described as Sisters Of Mercy meets Cher\", says Babydaddy. \"It was called Bicycle Of The Devil, a wretched, hilarious, bizarre, gothy techno-y nightmare.\" </p> <p>Matronic (n\u00e9e Ana Lynch) \"comes from a long line of wild women\". Her grandmother was a flapper in the 20s - \"she won a best legs competition at her university\" - and her mother moved to San Francisco in the 60s, when it was the hippy destination. When she was young, Matronic always identified with the wicked queen characters in Disney films (\"the ones that turned into dragons\") and wrote songs about outsider girls with weird haircuts. Suddenly, you can see the little girl the woman used to be. \"I was raised without boundaries,\" Matronic says. \"I was told I could achieve whatever I wanted with my life, and I was always blessed with an overabundance of love and support. The difficulties I've been through mean I'm pretty good with the hard stuff. I wouldn't be the person I am without the hardships I endured.\" </p> <p>First among Matronic's hardships - and decisive in her development into the fuck-you live-and-let-live gal that she is - was her parents' divorce when she was very young. Then, when she was six, her father came out. He died of Aids when she was 15. \"My grandmother, she of the best legs, died exactly a month before my father, and I was really close to her as well. That really was the worst year of my life. I was sad more than anything that I didn't really know my father as a person. That was the hardest thing.\" </p> <p>Matronic's father was the first person to have taken her to New York City - \"Getting off that plane when I was 13 and seeing Manhattan, I knew I was going to live there one day.\" She also inherited his love of music. Her mother is a painter of religious icons and, from her, Matronic got her artistic bent. \"My mother is amazing.\" </p> <p>Leaving Portland, Oregon, for San Francisco, where her family used to live, Matronic hung out on the gay scene. She says it might have been a subconscious attempt to form a posthumous closeness to her father. She performed at Tranny Shack (\"I took my mother on 'plastic surgery disaster' night, so she's seen it all\") and got into \"that instant gratification\" that comes with performance. She moved to New York and worked on a dance music project involving mathematical principles, \"because music is very scientific\". The Golden Mean forms part of the technicolour tattoo on her arm. </p> <p>When Shears and Babydaddy asked Matronic to join their sisterhood, she didn't take much persuading. Two weeks after their first performance together - at electroclash club Luxx in Brooklyn - they were signed to A Touch Of Class. </p> <p>While leonine lead vocalist Shears slinks on stage, throwing shapes as if in an improvisational dance class, Matronic is much more calculated in her performance, the legacy of her Tranny Shack years. The focused foil to Shears' spontaneity, she prefers playing smaller crowds: having conversations with the audience and reading them poetry. \"I got my start in cramped clubs, so it feels like a return to form,\" she says. The polar opposite of the blank pop princesses who clog up the charts, Matronic is the kind of friend you'd want. She's the heart of the band, the ringmistress, the queen of proceedings. \"I do have a dream of being the first woman ever to play the Emcee in Cabaret.\" </p> <p>The trio continued to perform in scuzzy-cool, below 14th Street clubs, but there was a realisation that, to rise above their electroclash origins, they would have to recruit - specifically, a drummer and a rhythm guitarist. Auditions were held. Paddy Boom (Patrick Seacor) and Del Marquis (Derek Gruen) made the grade. </p> <p>Boston-born Boom has been playing live since 1987. He's been in three bands: \"The only steady in my whole life has been playing music.\" An earnest, honest chap, he loves the life he's living. \"Keith Richards said that being in a band was like being a teenager for ever, and it's true. This last year has been a blast. I love travelling [he spent six months on a motorbike, driving from New York to Rio], so it's the ultimate fusion of my passions.\" </p> <p>The dinky, sometimes strangely whiskered, axeman Marquis met Shears while the latter was go-go dancing, and had seen the three Sisters performing: \"Babydaddy was doing choreography; he looked like a deer in headlights.\" A week after Marquis joined their ranks, they flew to Britain to begin touring and promotional duties. Marquis knew London already and was a habitu\u00e9 of the capital's more alternative gay clubs, Popstarz and the Ghetto. Growing up in New York, he'd been obsessed with Robert Smith, Johnny Marr and the Cult's Billy Duffy: \"I was a box bedroom guitar player, striking poses in my basement.\" He describes joining the band as \"stepping on to a moving train\". </p> <p>The train shows no sign of slowing, at least not for the next few months. Poached from A Touch Of Class by Polydor, their album was released in America at the end of July. In the US, they're at the stage they were here back in February. So it's appearances on cheesy radio breakfast shows such as New York's WPLJ (\"the best mix of the 80s, 90s and today!\") and support slots on bigger tours. The night before I met them for the first time, they supported the B-52's in front of an audience of Boston \"soccer moms\". They're the first to acknowledge their uneasy, prodigal status. </p> <p>\"We're a group of people who've always felt a bit estranged from America,\" says Babydaddy. \"You don't move to New York if you feel accepted in America. I was a kid who grew up gay in a town where I never knew a single gay person; I didn't have sex until I was 19 years old. It's a conservative country, much more conservative than the UK. I do feel very American, that we've made a very American album and America is home to me, but, in a way, we're estranged.\" </p> <p>Shears concedes that their \"outrageousness\" might work against them. \"We have our subversive moments, but we're wholesome. We're worldly, but what we stand for is moral. We stand for bringing people together. I don't care what someone's political beliefs are. What we do, the music rises above that. My family is rightwing and Christian; I could still have fun with a Republican. What I hope is that someone like that can listen to our song Mary and feel something.\" Marquis, meanwhile, says that getting airplay on \"mom and dad\" radio heralds \"a tiny revolution, a bit of subversiveness in middle America\". </p> <p>Tricia Romano, columnist on the Village Voice, who has long followed Scissor Sisters' career, says \"they don't have a shot\" at America. \"When anyone is any good, I have no hope they will break through. Thanks to the morons in the middle of the country, the music scene stinks. With the presidential election, even now the country is evenly split. Do you expect these people to make sensible decisions about music? If Scissor Sisters did succeed, they'd be in bad company.\" </p> <p>Still, Shears dreams of being \"one of those big touring bands we saw when we were growing up\". Babydaddy's world was rocked at 14 when he saw a spectacular M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce concert. \"Rock'n'roll grandiosity is not foreign to me: I saw Tommy Lee ride over the crowd on his drum set.\" </p> <p>\"We started in the US,\" says Shears, \"but we couldn't really muster up enough interest here, so we went overseas. Now we're coming back here, having learnt a lot more and having developed. And you know what, we fit the American model of what a touring rock'n'roll band should be better than we did when we left.\" </p> <p>So now they're touring, from Seattle to New York (where they played to 3,000 people), Atlanta to Cleveland (where they played to 30), before returning to the UK in October for a national tour and that gig at the Royal Albert Hall. Then, of course, there's the obligatory trip to Australia and Japan. </p> <p>Inevitably, though, ricocheting across the Atlantic is taking its toll. They are tired and Shears is frustrated at playing such similar sets night after night. Yet even that is providing impetus for writing another record. They've got \"a nice little nugget of songs\", though the ever-cautious Babydaddy adds, \"There's a lot of work to be done.\" Shears continues, \"Come February [when they finish touring], we'll be 100% ready to have a life again, to get back into the studio again. Or else ...\" he pauses, \"... someone will quit,\" Babydaddy concludes, firmly. </p> <p>On a New York rooftop, Scissor Sisters look a bit weary, waiting to have their picture taken. Babydaddy is applying sunscreen and explaining that the scar on his forehead, usually hidden by his trademark trilby, is a memento of when Marquis crashed the Scissor Sisters' van last winter. Matronic is relating the joys of $29 wigs and her love of pot and chocolate. A fidgety Shears is standing on sandbags as the asphalt is too hot for his bare feet. (Shears, as anyone who has seen the band live will know, has an ambivalent relationship with clothing.) </p> <p>When the photographer is ready, the band's tiredness evaporates. They are suddenly \"on\", all pouts and posturing. Even though they're just people mostly standing still, you can't help but stare. It is a reminder of the difference between people like them and the rest of us. They are pop stars. Bright young things under the sun </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mary is released on October 11.</p>",

  "George Bush's grandfather, the late US senator Prescott Bush, was a director and shareholder of companies that profited from their involvement with the financial backers of Nazi Germany. <p>The Guardian has obtained confirmation from newly discovered files in the US National Archives that a firm of which Prescott Bush was a director was involved with the financial architects of Nazism. </p> <p>His business dealings, which continued until his company's assets were seized in 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act, has led more than 60 years later to a civil action for damages being brought in Germany against the Bush family by two former slave labourers at Auschwitz and to a hum of pre-election controversy. </p> <p>The evidence has also prompted one former US Nazi war crimes prosecutor to argue that the late senator's action should have been grounds for prosecution for giving aid and comfort to the enemy. </p> <p>The debate over Prescott Bush's behaviour has been bubbling under the surface for some time. There has been a steady internet chatter about the \"Bush/Nazi\" connection, much of it inaccurate and unfair. But the new documents, many of which were only declassified last year, show that even after America had entered the war and when there was already significant information about the Nazis' plans and policies, he worked for and profited from companies closely involved with the very German businesses that financed Hitler's rise to power. It has also been suggested that the money he made from these dealings helped to establish the Bush family fortune and set up its political dynasty. </p> <p>Remarkably, little of Bush's dealings with Germany has received public scrutiny, partly because of the secret status of the documentation involving him. But now the multibillion dollar legal action for damages by two Holocaust survivors against the Bush family, and the imminent publication of three books on the subject are threatening to make Prescott Bush's business history an uncomfortable issue for his grandson, George W, as he seeks re-election. </p> <p>While there is no suggestion that Prescott Bush was sympathetic to the Nazi cause, the documents reveal that the firm he worked for, Brown Brothers Harriman (BBH), acted as a US base for the German industrialist, Fritz Thyssen, who helped finance Hitler in the 1930s before falling out with him at the end of the decade. The Guardian has seen evidence that shows Bush was the director of the New York-based Union Banking Corporation (UBC) that represented Thyssen's US interests and he continued to work for the bank after America entered the war. </p> <p><b> Tantalising</b><br> </p> <p> Bush was also on the board of at least one of the companies that formed part of a multinational network of front companies to allow Thyssen to move assets around the world. </p> <p>Thyssen owned the largest steel and coal company in Germany and grew rich from Hitler's efforts to re-arm between the two world wars. One of the pillars in Thyssen's international corporate web, UBC, worked exclusively for, and was owned by, a Thyssen-controlled bank in the Netherlands. More tantalising are Bush's links to the Consolidated Silesian Steel Company (CSSC), based in mineral rich Silesia on the German-Polish border. During the war, the company made use of Nazi slave labour from the concentration camps, including Auschwitz. The ownership of CSSC changed hands several times in the 1930s, but documents from the US National Archive declassified last year link Bush to CSSC, although it is not clear if he and UBC were still involved in the company when Thyssen's American assets were seized in 1942. </p> <p>Three sets of archives spell out Prescott Bush's involvement. All three are readily available, thanks to the efficient US archive system and a helpful and dedicated staff at both the Library of Congress in Washington and the National Archives at the University of Maryland. </p> <p>The first set of files, the Harriman papers in the Library of Congress, show that Prescott Bush was a director and shareholder of a number of companies involved with Thyssen. </p> <p>The second set of papers, which are in the National Archives, are contained in vesting order number 248 which records the seizure of the company assets. What these files show is that on October 20 1942 the alien property custodian seized the assets of the UBC, of which Prescott Bush was a director. Having gone through the books of the bank, further seizures were made against two affiliates, the Holland-American Trading Corporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation. By November, the Silesian-American Company, another of Prescott Bush's ventures, had also been seized. </p> <p>The third set of documents, also at the National Archives, are contained in the files on IG Farben, who was prosecuted for war crimes. </p> <p>A report issued by the Office of Alien Property Custodian in 1942 stated of the companies that \"since 1939, these (steel and mining) properties have been in possession of and have been operated by the German government and have undoubtedly been of considerable assistance to that country's war effort\". </p> <p>Prescott Bush, a 6ft 4in charmer with a rich singing voice, was the founder of the Bush political dynasty and was once considered a potential presidential candidate himself. Like his son, George, and grandson, George W, he went to Yale where he was, again like his descendants, a member of the secretive and influential Skull and Bones student society. He was an artillery captain in the first world war and married Dorothy Walker, the daughter of George Herbert Walker, in 1921. </p> <p>In 1924, his father-in-law, a well-known St Louis investment banker, helped set him up in business in New York with Averill Harriman, the wealthy son of railroad magnate E H Harriman in New York, who had gone into banking. </p> <p>One of the first jobs Walker gave Bush was to manage UBC. Bush was a founding member of the bank and the incorporation documents, which list him as one of seven directors, show he owned one share in UBC worth $125. </p> <p>The bank was set up by Harriman and Bush's father-in-law to provide a US bank for the Thyssens, Germany's most powerful industrial family. </p> <p>August Thyssen, the founder of the dynasty had been a major contributor to Germany's first world war effort and in the 1920s, he and his sons Fritz and Heinrich established a network of overseas banks and companies so their assets and money could be whisked offshore if threatened again. </p> <p>By the time Fritz Thyssen inherited the business empire in 1926, Germany's economic recovery was faltering. After hearing Adolf Hitler speak, Thyssen became mesmerised by the young firebrand. He joined the Nazi party in December 1931 and admits backing Hitler in his autobiography, I Paid Hitler, when the National Socialists were still a radical fringe party. He stepped in several times to bail out the struggling party: in 1928 Thyssen had bought the Barlow Palace on Briennerstrasse, in Munich, which Hitler converted into the Brown House, the headquarters of the Nazi party. The money came from another Thyssen overseas institution, the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvarrt in Rotterdam. </p> <p>By the late 1930s, Brown Brothers Harriman, which claimed to be the world's largest private investment bank, and UBC had bought and shipped millions of dollars of gold, fuel, steel, coal and US treasury bonds to Germany, both feeding and financing Hitler's build-up to war. </p> <p>Between 1931 and 1933 UBC bought more than $8m worth of gold, of which $3m was shipped abroad. According to documents seen by the Guardian, after UBC was set up it transferred $2m to BBH accounts and between 1924 and 1940 the assets of UBC hovered around $3m, dropping to $1m only on a few occasions. </p> <p>In 1941, Thyssen fled Germany after falling out with Hitler but he was captured in France and detained for the remainder of the war. </p> <p>There was nothing illegal in doing business with the Thyssens throughout the 1930s and many of America's best-known business names invested heavily in the German economic recovery. However, everything changed after Germany invaded Poland in 1939. Even then it could be argued that BBH was within its rights continuing business relations with the Thyssens until the end of 1941 as the US was still technically neutral until the attack on Pearl Harbor. The trouble started on July 30 1942 when the New York Herald-Tribune ran an article entitled \"Hitler's Angel Has $3m in US Bank\". UBC's huge gold purchases had raised suspicions that the bank was in fact a \"secret nest egg\" hidden in New York for Thyssen and other Nazi bigwigs. The Alien Property Commission (APC) launched an investigation. </p> <p>There is no dispute over the fact that the US government seized a string of assets controlled by BBH - including UBC and SAC - in the autumn of 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy act. What is in dispute is if Harriman, Walker and Bush did more than own these companies on paper. </p> <p>Erwin May, a treasury attache and officer for the department of investigation in the APC, was assigned to look into UBC's business. The first fact to emerge was that Roland Harriman, Prescott Bush and the other directors didn't actually own their shares in UBC but merely held them on behalf of Bank voor Handel. Strangely, no one seemed to know who owned the Rotterdam-based bank, including UBC's president. </p> <p>May wrote in his report of August 16 1941: \"Union Banking Corporation, incorporated August 4 1924, is wholly owned by the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. My investigation has produced no evidence as to the ownership of the Dutch bank. Mr Cornelis [sic] Lievense, president of UBC, claims no knowledge as to the ownership of the Bank voor Handel but believes it possible that Baron Heinrich Thyssen, brother of Fritz Thyssen, may own a substantial interest.\" </p> <p>May cleared the bank of holding a golden nest egg for the Nazi leaders but went on to describe a network of companies spreading out from UBC across Europe, America and Canada, and how money from voor Handel travelled to these companies through UBC. </p> <p>By September May had traced the origins of the non-American board members and found that Dutchman HJ Kouwenhoven - who met with Harriman in 1924 to set up UBC - had several other jobs: in addition to being the managing director of voor Handel he was also the director of the August Thyssen bank in Berlin and a director of Fritz Thyssen's Union Steel Works, the holding company that controlled Thyssen's steel and coal mine empire in Germany. </p> <p>Within a few weeks, Homer Jones, the chief of the APC investigation and research division sent a memo to the executive committee of APC recommending the US government vest UBC and its assets. Jones named the directors of the bank in the memo, including Prescott Bush's name, and wrote: \"Said stock is held by the above named individuals, however, solely as nominees for the Bank voor Handel, Rotterdam, Holland, which is owned by one or more of the Thyssen family, nationals of Germany and Hungary. The 4,000 shares hereinbefore set out are therefore beneficially owned and help for the interests of enemy nationals, and are vestible by the APC,\" according to the memo from the National Archives seen by the Guardian. </p> <p><b> Red-handed</b><br> </p> <p>Jones recommended that the assets be liquidated for the benefit of the government, but instead UBC was maintained intact and eventually returned to the American shareholders after the war. Some claim that Bush sold his share in UBC after the war for $1.5m - a huge amount of money at the time - but there is no documentary evidence to support this claim. No further action was ever taken nor was the investigation continued, despite the fact UBC was caught red-handed operating a American shell company for the Thyssen family eight months after America had entered the war and that this was the bank that had partly financed Hitler's rise to power. </p> <p>The most tantalising part of the story remains shrouded in mystery: the connection, if any, between Prescott Bush, Thyssen, Consolidated Silesian Steel Company (CSSC) and Auschwitz. </p> <p>Thyssen's partner in United Steel Works, which had coal mines and steel plants across the region, was Friedrich Flick, another steel magnate who also owned part of IG Farben, the powerful German chemical company. </p> <p>Flick's plants in Poland made heavy use of slave labour from the concentration camps in Poland. According to a New York Times article published in March 18 1934 Flick owned two-thirds of CSSC while \"American interests\" held the rest. </p> <p>The US National Archive documents show that BBH's involvement with CSSC was more than simply holding the shares in the mid-1930s. Bush's friend and fellow \"bonesman\" Knight Woolley, another partner at BBH, wrote to Averill Harriman in January 1933 warning of problems with CSSC after the Poles started their drive to nationalise the plant. \"The Consolidated Silesian Steel Company situation has become increasingly complicated, and I have accordingly brought in Sullivan and Cromwell, in order to be sure that our interests are protected,\" wrote Knight. \"After studying the situation Foster Dulles is insisting that their man in Berlin get into the picture and obtain the information which the directors here should have. You will recall that Foster is a director and he is particularly anxious to be certain that there is no liability attaching to the American directors.\" </p> <p>But the ownership of the CSSC between 1939 when the Germans invaded Poland and 1942 when the US government vested UBC and SAC is not clear. </p> <p>\"SAC held coal mines and definitely owned CSSC between 1934 and 1935, but when SAC was vested there was no trace of CSSC. All concrete evidence of its ownership disappears after 1935 and there are only a few traces in 1938 and 1939,\" says Eva Schweitzer, the journalist and author whose book, America and the Holocaust, is published next month. </p> <p>Silesia was quickly made part of the German Reich after the invasion, but while Polish factories were seized by the Nazis, those belonging to the still neutral Americans (and some other nationals) were treated more carefully as Hitler was still hoping to persuade the US to at least sit out the war as a neutral country. Schweitzer says American interests were dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The Nazis bought some out, but not others. </p> <p>The two Holocaust survivors suing the US government and the Bush family for a total of $40bn in compensation claim both materially benefited from Auschwitz slave labour during the second world war. </p> <p>Kurt Julius Goldstein, 87, and Peter Gingold, 85, began a class action in America in 2001, but the case was thrown out by Judge Rosemary Collier on the grounds that the government cannot be held liable under the principle of \"state sovereignty\". </p> <p>Jan Lissmann, one of the lawyers for the survivors, said: \"President Bush withdrew President Bill Clinton's signature from the treaty [that founded the court] not only to protect Americans, but also to protect himself and his family.\" </p> <p>Lissmann argues that genocide-related cases are covered by international law, which does hold governments accountable for their actions. He claims the ruling was invalid as no hearing took place. </p> <p>In their claims, Mr Goldstein and Mr Gingold, honorary chairman of the League of Anti-fascists, suggest the Americans were aware of what was happening at Auschwitz and should have bombed the camp. </p> <p>The lawyers also filed a motion in The Hague asking for an opinion on whether state sovereignty is a valid reason for refusing to hear their case. A ruling is expected within a month. </p> <p>The petition to The Hague states: \"From April 1944 on, the American Air Force could have destroyed the camp with air raids, as well as the railway bridges and railway lines from Hungary to Auschwitz. The murder of about 400,000 Hungarian Holocaust victims could have been prevented.\" </p> <p>The case is built around a January 22 1944 executive order signed by President Franklin Roosevelt calling on the government to take all measures to rescue the European Jews. The lawyers claim the order was ignored because of pressure brought by a group of big American companies, including BBH, where Prescott Bush was a director. </p> <p>Lissmann said: \"If we have a positive ruling from the court it will cause [president] Bush huge problems and make him personally liable to pay compensation.\" </p> <p>The US government and the Bush family deny all the claims against them. </p> <p>In addition to Eva Schweitzer's book, two other books are about to be published that raise the subject of Prescott Bush's business history. The author of the second book, to be published next year, John Loftus, is a former US attorney who prosecuted Nazi war criminals in the 70s. Now living in St Petersburg, Florida and earning his living as a security commentator for Fox News and ABC radio, Loftus is working on a novel which uses some of the material he has uncovered on Bush. Loftus stressed that what Prescott Bush was involved in was just what many other American and British businessmen were doing at the time. </p> <p>\"You can't blame Bush for what his grandfather did any more than you can blame Jack Kennedy for what his father did - bought Nazi stocks - but what is important is the cover-up, how it could have gone on so successfully for half a century, and does that have implications for us today?\" he said. </p> <p>\"This was the mechanism by which Hitler was funded to come to power, this was the mechanism by which the Third Reich's defence industry was re-armed, this was the mechanism by which Nazi profits were repatriated back to the American owners, this was the mechanism by which investigations into the financial laundering of the Third Reich were blunted,\" said Loftus, who is vice-chairman of the Holocaust Museum in St Petersburg. </p> <p>\"The Union Banking Corporation was a holding company for the Nazis, for Fritz Thyssen,\" said Loftus. \"At various times, the Bush family has tried to spin it, saying they were owned by a Dutch bank and it wasn't until the Nazis took over Holland that they realised that now the Nazis controlled the apparent company and that is why the Bush supporters claim when the war was over they got their money back. Both the American treasury investigations and the intelligence investigations in Europe completely bely that, it's absolute horseshit. They always knew who the ultimate beneficiaries were.\" </p> <p>\"There is no one left alive who could be prosecuted but they did get away with it,\" said Loftus. \"As a former federal prosecutor, I would make a case for Prescott Bush, his father-in-law (George Walker) and Averill Harriman [to be prosecuted] for giving aid and comfort to the enemy. They remained on the boards of these companies knowing that they were of financial benefit to the nation of Germany.\" </p> <p>Loftus said Prescott Bush must have been aware of what was happening in Germany at the time. \"My take on him was that he was a not terribly successful in-law who did what Herbert Walker told him to. Walker and Harriman were the two evil geniuses, they didn't care about the Nazis any more than they cared about their investments with the Bolsheviks.\" </p> <p>What is also at issue is how much money Bush made from his involvement. His supporters suggest that he had one token share. Loftus disputes this, citing sources in \"the banking and intelligence communities\" and suggesting that the Bush family, through George Herbert Walker and Prescott, got $1.5m out of the involvement. There is, however, no paper trail to this sum. </p> <p>The third person going into print on the subject is John Buchanan, 54, a Miami-based magazine journalist who started examining the files while working on a screenplay. Last year, Buchanan published his findings in the venerable but small-circulation New Hampshire Gazette under the headline \"Documents in National Archives Prove George Bush's Grandfather Traded With the Nazis - Even After Pearl Harbor\". He expands on this in his book to be published next month - Fixing America: Breaking the Stranglehold of Corporate Rule, Big Media and the Religious Right. </p> <p>In the article, Buchanan, who has worked mainly in the trade and music press with a spell as a muckraking reporter in Miami, claimed that \"the essential facts have appeared on the internet and in relatively obscure books but were dismissed by the media and Bush family as undocumented diatribes\". </p> <p>Buchanan suffers from hypermania, a form of manic depression, and when he found himself rebuffed in his initial efforts to interest the media, he responded with a series of threats against the journalists and media outlets that had spurned him. The threats, contained in e-mails, suggested that he would expose the journalists as \"traitors to the truth\". </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, he soon had difficulty getting his calls returned. Most seriously, he faced aggravated stalking charges in Miami, in connection with a man with whom he had fallen out over the best way to publicise his findings. The charges were dropped last month. </p> <p><b> Biography</b><br> </p> <p> Buchanan said he regretted his behaviour had damaged his credibility but his main aim was to secure publicity for the story. Both Loftus and Schweitzer say Buchanan has come up with previously undisclosed documentation. </p> <p>The Bush family have largely responded with no comment to any reference to Prescott Bush. Brown Brothers Harriman also declined to comment. </p> <p>The Bush family recently approved a flattering biography of Prescott Bush entitled Duty, Honour, Country by Mickey Herskowitz. The publishers, Rutledge Hill Press, promised the book would \"deal honestly with Prescott Bush's alleged business relationships with Nazi industrialists and other accusations\". </p> <p>In fact, the allegations are dealt with in less than two pages. The book refers to the Herald-Tribune story by saying that \"a person of less established ethics would have panicked ... Bush and his partners at Brown Brothers Harriman informed the government regulators that the account, opened in the late 1930s, was 'an unpaid courtesy for a client' ... Prescott Bush acted quickly and openly on behalf of the firm, served well by a reputation that had never been compromised. He made available all records and all documents. Viewed six decades later in the era of serial corporate scandals and shattered careers, he received what can be viewed as the ultimate clean bill.\" </p> <p>The Prescott Bush story has been condemned by both conservatives and some liberals as having nothing to do with the current president. It has also been suggested that Prescott Bush had little to do with Averill Harriman and that the two men opposed each other politically. </p> <p>However, documents from the Harriman papers include a flattering wartime profile of Harriman in the New York Journal American and next to it in the files is a letter to the financial editor of that paper from Prescott Bush congratulating the paper for running the profile. He added that Harriman's \"performance and his whole attitude has been a source of inspiration and pride to his partners and his friends\". </p> <p>The Anti-Defamation League in the US is supportive of Prescott Bush and the Bush family. In a statement last year they said that \"rumours about the alleged Nazi 'ties' of the late Prescott Bush ... have circulated widely through the internet in recent years. These charges are untenable and politically motivated ... Prescott Bush was neither a Nazi nor a Nazi sympathiser.\" </p> <p>However, one of the country's oldest Jewish publications, the Jewish Advocate, has aired the controversy in detail. </p> <p>More than 60 years after Prescott Bush came briefly under scrutiny at the time of a faraway war, his grandson is facing a different kind of scrutiny but one underpinned by the same perception that, for some people, war can be a profitable business.</p>",
  "For a brief time beginning in the 1960s, the Royal Court Theatre in London was the most important theatre in the west. From 1965 to 1972, Andy Phillips, who has died of throat cancer, aged 63, was the chief lighting technician and a revolutionary lighting designer. <p>He was a dominating presence. The significance of this should not be a surprise. Theatre begins with the Greeks and their daylight. He changed the appearance of the modem stage and influenced the theatrical work of a generation. His influence still lasts wherever theatre fulfils its ancient and modern task of helping us to understand ourselves. </p> <p>His background was surprising. The son of a priest, he was born at Cradley Heath, in the west Midlands, and educated at Dr Challoner's grammar school, in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. He dressed with a fastidious slovenliness - never shabbily - and seemed even over-casual. Behind the appearance was a crusading intensity. To know him, you had to see him work. I am surprised at how much I learned about writing by watching him lighting - but one work (act) of art is a commentary on all works of art. </p> <p>Like many people in theatre, he began by scraping together a career. He acted at Margate Theatre Royal (Scarlet Pimpernel; Nude With Violin) and, in 1960, formed Group One Productions to take plays by Bill Owen and Picasso to Edinburgh (Picasso's play was censored). He made theatrical props in Neal's Yard, Covent Garden. He was, first, a stage hand, and later a dayman electrician at the Royal Shakespeare Company (hourly rate 5s 3d). Then he moved to the Royal Court. </p> <p>He worked with all the Court's main directors and writers. His workload was enormous. Plays changed every three to six weeks, or oftener. A play finished on Saturday and the lighting rig was struck, and a new rig set up ready to \"tech\" the next play on Sunday morning. </p> <p>He worked pretty much round the clock. He took catnaps in the stalls. He once worked for 80 hours non-stop. He called himself a bum. There was no money to pay for more help. Judy Liebert, then his wife, was \"bowled over by this dynamic guy, who always said exactly what he thought and had the stamina of an ox\". </p> <p>The Court owed its pre-eminence, in part, not just to his radical innovations but to his sweat. He made himself a king of theatre - and was happy. </p> <p>He would not plot the light if the actors were not on stage. This was an unheard-of demand. Some directors thought it arrogance - a technician getting above his station. He said he was not lighting the scenery or the floor, but 6ft above the floor: \"I light the faces.\" </p> <p>He told me that he lit the whites of the eyes. It taught me that a writer must see his characters' eyes as he writes. If the eyes do not speak, nothing is said. We worked in Vienna on my play Lear (1972). In it, Lear's eyes are taken out. I wondered what Phillips would do. He seemed to concentrate the light on the hands. Uncannily, I became aware of Lear's fingernails. </p> <p>Phillips's trademark was white light. But it was the puritanical precision of the prism, in which are all colours, tones and shades. It was a microscope focused on the horizon. It showed what was there. Nothing could be richer or more colourful. </p> <p>Technically, he was influenced by the Berliner Ensemble's visit to London in 1968. He had a long relationship with the actor and Labour MP Glenda Jackson. It is said he was impatient of complicated political argument. I was never tempted to try it with him. I knew his mocking irony in advance. His socialism - with a touch of anarchy - was secure. He was incorruptible, with the hidden inner stateliness that belongs to good people. </p> <p>After the Court, his work was worldwide. He cooperated closely with John Dexter (two Tonies, plays, operas, The Merchant, The Party, Galileo, A Streetcar Named Desire). In 1984, both his agent Peter Crouch and Dexter died. He continued to work with the designer Hayden Griffin. </p> <p>It was an ideal partnership. They shared a vision of amplitude through precision and a deep responsibility for their craft. His last play was Mercy (at the Soho Theatre last July) - a symbolic title for someone whose work was so exemplary. He was planning to sail his boat to Calais; if you do not love the sea, you should not work in drama. His partner Jenny King, and his son Sam, will make the voyage with his ashes. </p> <p>An image is etched on my brain. It sums up what I learned from him. He was working at the Court. He stood alone on the stage, silent, slightly bent forward, very concentrated, and stared down at the small white card in his hand. Nothing was written on it. He studied the light that fell on it. He did it with the massive stillness of all great artists at their work. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Andrew Phillips, lighting designer, born December 30 1940; died September 1 2004</p>",
  "<b> Private lives are on public view</b> <br> <p>In <b>El Pa\u00eds</b> (September 20), Francisco Peregil examined how Spanish television increasingly pries into people's private lives. Periodismo de coraz\u00f3n (journalism of the heart) routinely presents stories based on \"rumour, insinuation, slander and invention\", and it now comprises as much as 30% of TV schedules. \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Pelayo - who runs Korpa, Spain's biggest agency \"dedicated to the gossip business\" - felt things had gone too far. \"The real problem is that more and more programmes are using non-professionals. These are people with no idea about journalism,\" he told Peregil. </p> <p>Gossip shows have continued unchecked thanks to Spanish law. Antonio Bernal, a media lawyer, said even successful libel or privacy suits rarely ended in compensation. \"When it comes to a choice between freedom of expression and the right to inform on the one hand, and the right to privacy and one's reputation on the other, the courts will always incline toward the first,\" he explained. And it can take as long as 10 years for the courts to reach a decision. </p> <p>But a change to the law would affect responsible journalism as well, said Peregil. A more workable solution would be a \"system of self-regulation for television stations\" as well as an independent audiovisual council. </p> <p><b> China's great drive forward</b><br> </p> <p>The scale of China's massive road-building programme is such that the country last year accounted for 40% of the world's cement usage. \"In 1989, China had lots of bicycles and only 168 miles of expressways,\" said Robyn Meredith in <b>Forbes</b> magazine (September 20). \"By the end of last year - a year during which China spent \u00a323bn building roads - it had 18,500 miles of expressways, and the plan is to reach 51,000 by 2008.\" </p> <p>The new motorways have slashed travelling distances between the big centres (of which there are many: 38 cities are home to more than a million people). \"Better roads mean that factories can be built in parts of China ... where labour and real estate are cheaper,\" said Meredith. \"Driving times from inland factories to ports will be cut dramatically.\" </p> <p>The roads, of course, create a fresh set of problems. \"The roads that bring more car sales bring more smog. And road safety is in its infancy.\" And it's not all rosy for western companies setting up in the inland cities, warned Meredith: \"Before you site your next Asian chip mill in the hinterlands, consider the downside ... It is one thing to be served dishes of slithery fish stomachs at a formal Chinese banquet, as might happen in Shanghai or Beijing. But it is quite another for western executives to be expected to host affairs with such delicacies for a dozen government officials in the middle of nowhere - and to add to their expense accounts the customary parties afterward with two dozen karaoke-singing hookers. Try explaining that roughly $4,000-a-night expense to niggling accountants back at headquarters.\" </p> <p><b> How to get foot out of mouth</b><br> </p> <p>Anyone with a squirmy situation fresh in their memory might find solace in the \"survival guide for mortifying moments\" offered by <b>Psychology Today</b> (October). Jen Matlack quizzed a number of experts on the best technique to cope with the flood of awkwardness that follows a faux pas or any similar scenario that \"can make us want to ... bury our heads in deep sand\". </p> <p>You know how it feels: \"Time passes more slowly. Normal silences in the conversation seem to drag on forever. You squirm. And, of course, paying attention to your discomfort makes you even more self-conscious, intensifying the experience.\" Matlack had found no miracle cure - her advice, instead, was not to over-inflate the situation's significance. \"Thankfully the way to cope with many of these mortifying moments is pretty simple: take a deep breath and realise that even though you may feel like your scarlet cheeks are visible from outer space, chances are that nobody will even remember this incident.\" They might, on the other hand, harbour a grudge for years, but it's probably best not to think that way.</p>",
  "<p>Twenty-three years after he vacated the Tardis with a scarf-flapping shrug of insouciance, Tom Baker has found himself occupying a unique position among the showbiz old guard. With one brogue plonked in the plush foyer of the establishment (courtesy of his career-based longevity and monumentally posh voice) and the other wedged firmly in the revolving door of anarchy (see: his involvement with Little Britain and an enduring reputation for sauciness), the actor is regarded with a fondness entirely bereft of the \"postmodern\" naffery that typically blights the children's TV veteran. While others remain pickled in the past by well-meaning fans, he's a great British eccentric, a booming bon viveur whose wit and general bonkersness ensures him an eminence that transcends mere nostalgia and becomes, instead, genuine affection, the sort that one might apply to a fond-remembered teacher or a favourite uncle. </p> <p>Baker's latest incarnation is Donald MacDonald, be-kilted brother of the late Hector (Richard Briers) in BBC1's Monarch Of The Glen. An \"aristocratic old buffer\", he galumphs and guffaws his way through the fictional Highland brae of Glenbogle, inciting all manner of cable-knitted fuss and nonsense with his unique brand of roaring irrationality. MacDonald is, of course, the latest variation on a theme (the theme basically being Tom Baker), with a panoply of attendant Bakerisms - toothsome mischief, sudden gales of deafening laughter, etc - echoing his equally galumphing, guffawing roles in Dr Who, The Life And Loves Of A She Devil and Vic &amp; Bob's shonky \"reinterpretation\" of Randall And Hopkirk (Deceased). His presence in Monarch ... may be akin to a pantomime horse with a tuba arriving at an Age Concern harp recital, but it is, as ever, good to have him back. </p> <p>It's 8am and Baker is busily rattling around his trailer, mulling over the morning papers (\"Do Scots really like the SNP? Really?\") and, being a spirited bag of beans, roaring with laughter at the drop of a fedora. \"I'm back in bed now, though!\" he booms down the blower, his voice an instantly recognisable thunderclap of tomfoolery. \"It's quite cold here in the Highlands, you know. Yeees, I'm in bed reading a book called 60 Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong because, you see, I live in France and I'm desperately trying to find out why. </p> <p>\"I've been eaten alive by midges,\" he continues, blithely charging off at a right-angled tangent. \"They've really gone for the ankles. I'm lying here rubbing my legs together like a bloody old grasshopper.\" </p> <p>Despite declaring his pins \"absolutely marvellous\", Baker has found that his knees are not what they were and now, at the grand old age of 70, finds it difficult to charge around with the gusto of yore. \"When I see someone scampering up stairs it brings tears to my eyes,\" he bellows. \"I was amazed to see an old chap in Marks &amp; Spencer the other day bend down and tie his shoelaces. I've been wearing slip-ons now for four years. In fact, I never go anywhere without a shoehorn. AH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAAAAH!!!\" </p> <p>Baker - a renowned peddler of Gallifrey-sized pork pies - describes Monarch ... as \"a particularly delicious kind of old nonsense\". In general, though, he thinks modern telly is rubbish. \"TV makes lots of people long for death,\" he sighs, thespianishly. \"It really is so formulaic and utterly predictable, dear God. I've been an actor so long, I've heard all the cliches. But then, if you tell a great cliche, people are reassured, aren't they? Playing that old alien Dr Who reassured people so much that they want to hold my hand.\" </p> <p>So enamoured was he with his powers of hand-holdery that during his spell as the beloved time lord (1974 to 1981), Baker \"left (himself) and floated about as a hero\". During this phase of transcendental self-avoidance, the avowed masochist briefly married co-star/assistant Lalla Ward, successfully vanquished the Stones of Blood (in The Stones Of Blood), drank copiously with Francis Bacon, inadvertently transformed jelly babies into playground-championed weapons of micro destruction (after an improvised scene in Planet Of Evil in which he used the humble sweet to threaten a recalcitrant resident of Zeta Minor), and found himself willingly enveloped by \"curious girls enthusiastic to lay a time lord\". Though he hated K9 (\"insufferable thing\") and was appalled by companion Leela's cave-girl costume (\"the ironies escaped me\"), he considers his stint as Britain's favourite unconvincing alien-obliterator a monumental blast: albeit a monumental blast that's now accompanied by a certain time-related weariness. It's perhaps unsurprising, then, that Baker is wary of the forthcoming series of Doctor Who, in which Christopher Eccleston - the ninth TV incarnation - will allegedly tackle \"social issues\" and \"romantic encounters\". </p> <p>\"Romance? Well, I shouldn't be surprised, really,\" snaps Baker, who once tried to murder his former mother-in-law with a hoe. \"They'll do anything to make people watch. But the Doctor was always a mystery. We know he had two hearts, but what of the rest? Four lungs, four balls and a sonic screwdriver? AH-HAH-HAH! It's best to leave people guessing.\" </p> <p>\"I read an interview with the guy who's playing Dr Who,\" he continues, audibly miffed. \"He was talking about Earth as if it was important! I was deeply, deeply disappointed. I mean, Christ, the next thing they'll be doing is talking about global warming. Oh, it's so sad, isn't it? I find a fantasy programme's preoccupation with this world so parochial.\" </p> <p>Nostalgia may trap lesser talents in the amber of their fans' childhood-rooted imaginations, but it's served Baker well, ensuring the actor frequently finds himself employed, rather than merely patronised, \"by the children who watched (Dr Who) and are now full of fondness\". Two such admirers are Little Britain's Matt Lucas and David Walliams, who borrowed his sublimely ludicrous NT roar for the similarly eccentric role of series narrator. He's evidently proud as parsley of his contribution, deeming the duo \"absurdly funny\". </p> <p>\"I like that dreadful layabout in the wheelchair,\" he barks. \"There's nothing wrong with him except he's idle. What an absolutely terrific idea!\" </p> <p>Although he claims his \"imminent death\" ensures he has \"absolutely no future\" (his lifelong morbidity has led him to erect his own pre-engraved gravestone), the truth - as is so often the case with this inveterate nonsense-monger - couldn't be further removed. Not only will he appear in the movie version of The Magic Roundabout (as misanthropic newcomer ZeBadDee), the heavily-jowled japester has also been approached with a view to turning both his brilliantly unpleasant children's story, The Boy Who Kicked Pigs, and his similarly belting autobiography, Who On Earth Is Tom Baker?, into films. \"Of course,\" he whispers, mock-conspiratorially. \"I agreed to everything. Actors always do.\" </p> <p>Does Baker - who embraced monasticism at 15 because, he claims, \"I was randy for martyrdom\" - ever suffer pangs of nostalgia? \"Yes, I find that I'm nostalgic for my youth and the time when I believed in God and loved my mother,\" he bellows. \"Of course, when I look back, I think I cheated on God a bit and I certainly could've loved my mother more. But I did my best. Yeeees,\" he muses, glumly. \"Nostalgia happens to us all, doesn't it?\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Saturday September 25</strong> </p> <p><strong> Lucky Break</strong> (Peter Cattaneo, 2001) <br>9.10pm, C4 </p> <p>Cattaneo's follow-up to The Full Monty is a disappointment: a prison break comedy that seems more suited to the small screen. James Nesbitt leads this tale of a group of prisoners who put on a musical stage show as cover for their escape attempt, and the cast also includes Timothy Spall, Bill Nighy and Christopher Plummer; but Cattaneo can't seem to decide whether he's doing broad comedy or character study. </p> <p><strong> Erin Brockovich</strong> (Steven Soderbergh, 2000) <br>9.10pm, Five </p> <p>Onetime indie maverick Soderbergh completed his move into the mainstream with this gripping true story of a single mum's battle against the giant power company that contaminated a community's water supply. It's told briskly and emotionally, but without opening the sentimental floodgates. Much of that is down to its star, Julia Roberts, in truly terrific form as Erin, who stumbles across the wrongdoing while working for a small-league lawyer (Albert Finney). At times it looks like a Roberts vehicle: \"This is where Julia gets to cry; here she struggles bravely with a cold;\" but she's pretty convincing, and great fun in the scenes where she tells the stuffy corporate and legal bigwigs to cut the crap. </p> <p><strong> Pleasantville</strong> (Gary Ross, 1998) <br>10pm, BBC2 </p> <p>1990s siblings Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) and David (Tobey Maguire) are whisked back through the television set to the nostalgic haven of a 1950s sitcom. There, life is happy, easy, but also monochrome and dull. Ross's directorial debut makes witty and affectionate fun of small-town American family life, and essays a brilliant cinematic trick, the presence of the modern teenagers gradually infecting the black-and-white TV world with colour. </p> <p> <strong> Cape Fear</strong> (Martin Scorsese, 1991) <br>11.30pm, ITV1 </p> <p>A screaming remake of J Lee Thompson's more restrained 1962 thriller. Robert De Niro is way over the top as Max Cady, the ex-con seeking vengeance on the lawyer responsible for putting him away. Cady, a rapist, attacks Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) through his wife and daughter (Jessica Lange and a shrill Juliette Lewis), sadistically working on the family's pressure points. The suspense slides into conventional, well executed shock-horror territory, but it's brutally gripping. Enjoyable cameos, too, from the original's stars, Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck. </p> <p> <strong> Tough Guys</strong> (Jeff Kanew, 1986) <br>12midnight, BBC1 </p> <p>Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas play former bank robbers emerging, after 30 years in stir, into a strange, brash world where they no longer count for much. Charles Durning and Eli Wallach are among those whose new realism contrasts with the old lags' romanticism; and some fun and games brighten the pervasive air of wistfulness. </p> <p><strong> Blue Thunder</strong> (John Badham, 1983) <br> 12.55am, C4 </p> <p>Blue Thunder is the name of a state-of-the-art military helicopter, bulging with smart weaponry and hi-tech surveillance equipment. Roy Scheider's LAPD flyer Murphy gets to pilot it, rooting out political corruption in the form of an old enemy from their Vietnam days - Malcolm McDowell's Cochrane. Plot and characterisation barely get off the ground, but there's plenty of exciting stunt flying, leading to a climactic aerial duel among the tower blocks. It also has the great Warren Oates in his last screen performance, playing Murphy's boss Captain Braddock. </p> <p><strong> Sunday September 26</strong> </p> <p> <strong> North To Alaska</strong> (Henry Hathaway, 1960) <br>3.40pm, Five </p> <p>A boisterous northern-western, starring John Wayne and Stewart Granger as gold prospectors seeking their fortune in 1890s Alaska. Problems proliferate: Granger's mail-order girl (Capucine) prefers Wayne; his kid brother Fabian is big trouble, and conman Ernie Kovacs is trying to swindle the pair out of their claim. But there's nothing that can't be settled by a rousing brawl. </p> <p><strong> Legally Blonde</strong> (Robert Luketic, 2001)<br>8.05pm, Five </p> <p>Reese Witherspoon's Californian sorority queen, Elle, is undeterred when her ambitious boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis) dumps her for more intellectual types as he heads for Harvard Law School: she enrols there too. Witherspoon is in her element as a pretty-in-pink bull in a china shop in Harvard's hallowed halls - even if the way in which her Valley girl street-wisdom proves superior to the political sophistication of her fellow students seems a tad implausible. </p> <p> <strong> Gladiator</strong> (Ridley Scott, 2000) <br>9pm, C4 </p> <p>Scott's stunning computer-generated recreation of imperial Rome reinvented a genre not seen since the days of The Fall Of The Roman Empire (in 1964), the film on which this is based. It's a bfull-blooded epic, full of fiery war and crunching gladiatorial combat, but clever enough to contain political intrigue and undying love too. Russell Crowe's Maximus, the betrayed general who becomes a Colosseum gladiator, fighting to avenge his family and to free Rome, is a rock-solid hero, and he's supported by Joaquin Phoenix as the ruthless-but-needy new emperor Commodus, Connie Nielsen as his sister Lucilla, and the last, poignant appearance of Oliver Reed as the wistful old fighter Proximo. </p> <p> <strong> Monday September 27</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Green For Danger</strong> (Sidney Gilliat, 1946) <br>1.35pm, C4 </p> <p>In an emergency war time hospital, a man dies under mysterious circumstances. When Sister Marion (Judy Campbell) cries murder, she too dies. Enter Alastair Sim's wickedly clever Inspector Cockrill to sift through the red herrings in this brisk thriller. Among the handful of suspects are Leo Genn and Trevor Howard. </p> <p> <strong> Waiting To Exhale</strong> (Forest Whitaker, 1995) <br>12.20am, BBC1 </p> <p>Whitaker's directorial debut is a disappointing tale of four black women in search of a decent bloke. It's a monotonous trawl through the battle-of-the-sexes cliches, with regular sex bouts thrown in to lighten things up. Angela Bassett is the pick of the ladies, the others being Whitney (as an actress she makes a good singer) Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon. </p> <p> <strong> Tuesday September 28</strong> </p> <p> <strong> My Darling Clementine</strong> (John Ford, 1946) <br> 1.30pm, C4 </p> <p>The most authoritative screen account of the gunfight at the OK Corral, and the most poetic. Ford turns the historic showdown into an allegory of the civilising of the west, and every scene - the square dance at the new church, even Wyatt Earp's trip to the barber - is loaded with rich significance. Measured performances, too, from Henry Fonda as Earp and Victor Mature as Doc Holliday. </p> <p> <strong> Besieged</strong> (Bernardo Bertolucci, 1998)<br>11.20pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Originally made for TV, this is a small-scale, fascinating love story from Bertolucci. It's set in Rome where Thandie Newton's African exile Shandurai is a live-in cleaner for the timid pianist Kinsky (David Thewlis). He is infatuated with her; she is intrigued, but has a husband back home, and rejects his advances. A beautifully crafted, engaging, and surprising tale. </p> <p> <strong> The Man Who Knew Too Little</strong> (Jon Amiel, 1997) <br>11.35pm, BBC1 </p> <p>An engaging parody of Hitchcock's thrillers: the great man made two films called The Man Who Knew Too Much. This has Bill Murray coming to London and getting all mixed up in an assassination plot, although he thinks he's involved in a drama workshop. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, Alfred Molina and Richard Wilson help keep it jolly-tense. </p> <p><strong> Kissed</strong> (Lynne Stopkewich, 1996) <br>2.40am, C4 </p> <p>Romance is dead for Molly Parker's Sandra - she's a young woman attracted to corpses, and takes a job in a funeral parlour to indulge her passions. Then a walking talking boyfriend, medical student Matt (Peter Outerbridge) turns up, but can hardly compete with her fatal attractions, the big stiff. There's a ghoulish embalming lesson that looks like something from George A Romero, but otherwise Stopkewich, in this low-budget indie debut, directs with style, confidence and discretion. And Parker's fine, sensitive performance is the beating heart of the film. </p> <p> <strong> Wednesday September 29</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Thirty-Nine Steps</strong> (Ralph Thomas, 1959)<br>1.30pm, C4 </p> <p>Thomas's version of John Buchan's famous novel about an English gent wrongly accused of murder and trying to clear his name is in almost every way inferior to Hitchcock's 1935 classic. It lacks both the suspense and humour of the original, and while Kenneth More works earnestly as the Boy's Own hero Richard Hannay, he's nothing like as smoothly charismatic as Robert Donat. But if you forget about the original it's an enjoyable yarn - and the Scottish scenery is marvellous. </p> <p> <strong> Play It To The Bone</strong> (Ron Shelton, 1999) <br>11pm, ITV1 </p> <p>Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas are second-rate boxers, well along the road to Palookaville when their big chance arrives: a chance to fight each other on the undercard of a Mike Tyson match. The friends have 12 hours or so to get from LA to Vegas, accompanied by Lolita Davidovich's Grace: Harrelson's ex, now Banderas's girlfriend. It's an absorbing look at the big fight world, with appearances by James Woods, Kevin Costner and even Rod Stewart; but it doesn't match Shelton's earlier bouts of sporting drama, from Bull Durham to Tin Cup. </p> <p> <strong> Thursday September 30</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Devil And Miss Jones</strong> (Sam Wood, 1941) <br>2pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Fluffy comedy that lends a light touch to industrial relations. Charles Coburn plays the enormously wealthy corporate boss who takes a job incognito at one of his department stores in order to get the lowdown on union activity. Jean Arthur is the salesgirl who gradually alters his worldview. Top quality script by Norman Krasna, and neatly directed by Wood. </p> <p> <strong> Friday October 1</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Raising Arizona</strong> (Joel Coen, 1987) <br>11.35pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Nicolas Cage is in his element in this wild farce. He's the world's worst robber, hitching up with police officer Holly Hunter and stealing one of a set of quins when the couple prove childless. Things go from bad to desperate when old convict buddies John Goodman and William Forsythe turn up, then the somewhat less friendly bounty hunter, the Lone Biker of the Apocalypse (Randall Cobb): a Coen brothers love-it- or-hate-it special. </p> <p> <strong> Liar</strong> (Jonas Pate, 1997) <br>12.05am, Five </p> <p>With its tough cops grilling a murder suspect on a lie-detector and a sleazy plot recounted mainly in flashback, the Pate twins' twisty indie thriller is a throwback to the 1940s. There's a convincing cast too: Michael Rooker as the senior cop, Chris Penn his young sidekick, Tim Roth as the shifty playboy in their spotlight and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as the victim. Intelligent and intriguing.</p>",
  "A trip forward in time to Head Office, 2020. You cannot even begin to think about the new skills required of you, the new methods of getting the day's graft done, because one thing keeps nagging at you: where are the desks? And where are the people who used to sit at those desks? There seems to be just a handful of people about, gathered in small groups. Some stand as they work on handheld computers, others sit in groups, on clusters of chairs. Even the office itself is tiny. The huge glass and chrome monstrosity the company put up in the 1980s has long since been sold off - with fewer people to accommodate, there will be no need for sprawling blocks. <p>Predicting the future of work is not a science. The vision above is that of Michael White of the Policy Studies Institute, the co-author of Managing to Change, which was published as part of the Future of Work research programme. Will his prediction be any more accurate than those of some of the illustrious names who have preceeded him in foretelling the future? </p> <p>John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1930, in The Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, that by the end of the 20th century we would all be working just five hours a week. In 1996, Jeremy Rifkin soothsaid the end of work altogether. In the 21st century, he predicted, employment would be phased out, at least in the industrialised world. Jobs would be taken over by machines and workers forced on to the dole. The German sociologist Ulrich Beck, in The Brave New World of Work, published in 2000, claimed the work society was disappearing. The working environment of the future, he said, will resemble that of Brazil, with no permanent jobs, only informal and insecure labour.</p> <p>Going by current trends, Keynes's proposition is impossible and Rifkin's and Beck's seem implausible. So can we take a guess at how we will be working in 2020?</p> <p>In 16 years' time, most employment in Britain will still be structured much as it is now: the majority of us will still be working for other people, mostly in a place other than our homes, doing a job instantly recognisable today. There probably will not have been a wholesale shift to an itinerant workforce. An example from the immediate past proves the need for caution when predicting change: the fastest-growing occupation in the 90s was not software engineering (although the numbers employed in that trade grew by 185% between 1992 and 1999) or even telephone sales or business consultancy (106% and 93% respectively). The real growth industry, at a massive 302%, was the distinctly low-tech job of hairdressing.</p> <p>In the words of Richard Pearson, the director of the market research centre the Institute for Employment Studies, rather than being about sweeping changes, the future is about \"evolution, rather than revolution\".</p> <p>So how will we be working in 16 years' time? The answer, of course, is far from certain. Most of the government's peering into the future takes us only as far as 2010 - such as the work done by the Department of Work and Pensions, and the Department of Trade and Industry's Foresight team. As Alexandra Jones, a senior researcher at the Work Foundation, says, predictions past that date become \"a lot wobblier\".</p> <p>But there is some evidence to provide us with ideas. From his base in Leeds, Professor Peter Nolan runs the Future of Work programme, a huge research project which has been running under the auspices of the Economic and Social Research Council for six years and across 22 UK universities. He paints a picture of a growing divergence between those employed in highly skilled, highly paid professions, and those at the bottom of the employment chain. The economy of work, he believes, will be increasingly hourglass-shaped.</p> <p>\"At the top end of the jobs hierarchy, people are likely to enjoy substantial discretion over their hours, places and patterns of working time. But this will be fuelled by the growth of low-paid and unskilled labour, doing jobs that would have been familiar 100 years ago,\" says Nolan. He predicts managers and those in the professions will have job security. And, contrary to the predictions of futurologists, the majority of employees are likely to continue working for an organisation, rather than for themselves, or for a series of different people. In 2020 nine out of 10 jobs will still be permanent, although maybe not full time, he says.</p> <p>Flexible working is the mantra of those who seek change in the way our working lives are structured - in the first six months of this year, this newspaper alone carried 67 stories that mentioned the phrase \"flexible working\". The government has given employees the right to request flexible working patterns, and last month's Guardian/ICM poll showed a strong appetite for greater flexibility, especially among young workers. That hunger is likely to have been satisfied by 2020, by which time the way our jobs are structured will have changed massively. Many people will work as employed freelancers. People will be trained to work on a wide range of different projects, liaising with experts outside the company when additional help is needed. Companies will be smaller and more specialised. Jones says management structures and hierarchies will flatten out, giving workers more control over their jobs.</p> <p>Offices will be for \"face time\" only, when meetings in the flesh are essential, says Jones. Everything that can be done from home, will be. That will have wider benefits, too. Half the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are the result of office work - people's journeys to and from their workplace, and heating and air conditioning once they are there - according to figures from the European commission. While homeworkers will still need to keep warm, there will be much less wasted energy use.</p> <p>But our connections with our employers might actually become more profound, even if we spend less time with co-workers. We are likely to stay in our jobs for longer as we learn and develop within the company, and so become less likely to look for another job. Keeping staff is vitally important in the service sector, and Jones believes employers will finally have woken up to the paradox that to keep someone on, you need to keep developing in them precisely those skills that would equip them to leave and find a job elsewhere.</p> <p>Companies that want to retain staff will also have to take a more relaxed attitude to time. Jones envisages careers being seen as a landscape, with peaks and valleys of working hours, allowing the young to work longer, those with families to work less, and retirement to be phased in gradually. All workers, not just those with children, will be allowed to take time out to study or travel. Inevitably, that would require us to manage our own careers and finances, particularly securing our pension provision.</p> <p>John Cridland, the deputy director general of the CBI, agrees. He thinks that by 2020 there will be no fixed hours, or job descriptions: everything will be up for negotiation. \"This will definitely be the case with managerial and professional jobs, but also in other service jobs too. Obviously you need staff in a restaurant at the same time as customers, but provided the basics are covered, there'll be no point in having lots of people with the same set of skills.\"</p> <p>More jobs will be open to more people as well. White hopes that by 2020 every other person working would be a woman, particularly in senior roles, \"although I think it's unlikely to be 50-50 by then\", he says. While gender parity will not yet be a reality, women in the 2020 workplace will be better able to realise their career aspirations. \"Put it this way, it's going to have to change because women are just not going to put up with things like glass ceilings in the future,\" says Nolan.</p> <p>That process will be aided by men playing a greater role in caring for their children and their parents: by 2021 there will be 12 million people over the age of 65, so the burden of care will have to be more evenly shared. Instead of men working 60 hours a week and women working 20, it is likely that many couples will opt to split the workload, as well as their responsibilities at home - so we could well see both partners choosing to work a 35-hour week, with the costs of additional care subsidised by the government. Care provision will be another area in which employers see the chance to build loyalty among their staff. Workplace nurseries will be more common, and technology will boost parental confidence in them, with webcams allowing mothers and fathers to check on their children whenever they choose.</p> <p>It will not only be women who secure higher status in the workplace. There are already a million disabled people who say they want to work, according to the Disability Rights Commission, and that figure will grow as the workforce ages - particularly as disability includes conditions such as diabetes and severe heart problems, as well as long-term depression. In the sardine-tight labour market of 2020, that will be a group employers will not be able to ignore.</p> <p>Cridland feels more progress will also have been made towards racial integration in the workplace. \"For instance, many African-Caribbean male teenagers have a greater tendency to rebel and opt out of education when they are younger, although they go back into learning when they are older,\" he says. \"Some employers are already realising they need to do more outreach work to get to these groups: in a tight labour market, and as service sector employers realise they need employees who reflect the communities where they work, they really need to attract them as employees.\"</p> <p>There may also be more Pakistani and Bangladeshi women at work by 2020. Those two groups are currently badly underrepresented in the workforce, but research from Manchester University suggests that more of these women, particularly those with qualifications, will want jobs.</p> <p>Older people, too, will be more prevalent in the workplace. Jones says the likely retirement age by 2020 will be 70, and many future-watchers predict that will rise even further - not only to counter the pensions crisis, but also to release the pressure on the labour market.</p> <p>Nolan, however, disputes the notion that older people would stay on at work out of choice. \"That's fine if you're a lawyer or company director where you can pick and chose your hours and projects,\" he says, \"but if we're talking about someone who's been working in a factory for 40 years, do you really think that they'd want to carry on for another five?\"</p> <p>The real beneficiaries of the changing nature of the workplace will be those who have low levels of skills but can none the less master technology, predicts White. At the moment, the opportunities open to those people may be no more exciting than working in a call centre, but new technologies should open up other possibilities. Cridland agrees, adding that everyone will be better qualified (by 2010 there will be 2m fewer jobs that require only GCSEs, for example), so employees will be valued for their skills rather than just for turning up. If they cannot master technology, however, the least skilled will have to settle for supporting the freer lifestyles of the their better-paid peers. And many, reckons Richard Pearson of the IES, will be forced to take second jobs.</p> <p>Outsourcing, the issue currently animating both the incumbent and the aspirational president in the US, will continue. Reservation agents, computer programmers, database managers, financial analysts - all those whose jobs that depend, in part, on an ability to master repetitive tasks performed on a computer - will have been relocated abroad. \"Only the customer-facing jobs will be left,\" says Cridland.</p> <p>But, he points out, the lost jobs will be replaced with shiny new ones, more suitable to our developing economy. He points to the banking giant HSBC, which creates two jobs for every one it sends offshore. </p> <p>The bottom line about work, of course, is that we do it for money. Those who do it for hard cash in the hand might not be happy about some of the changes ahead: identity cards and the decreasing use of cash will make back-pocket payments harder, in effect formalising the black economy. That will, however, be a positive for those people, mainly women, who work off the books not to avoid tax but because their employers want to avoid giving them full employment benefits. The minimum wage is also likely to increase, and childcare and housework are likely to attract tax breaks, meaning people can afford to pay their nanny and cleaner more.</p> <p>Ian Hopkinson, the head of employment tax at KPMG, thinks salaries will consist of totally flexible remuneration packages: we will be able to choose between pay and a combination of benefits, such as buying days off. While this is already happening in some workplaces, it will be the norm by 2020. He adds that while there are still likely to be behemoth salaries paid to City executives, wages will be far more transparent. Sadly, he also thinks it unlikely that teachers or nurses will see radical increases in their relative salaries. \"These are likely to remain in the private sector and future governments aren't going to be able to afford to pay them huge amounts,\" he says.</p> <p>Public sector workers will still negotiate their pay collectively, through trades unions. But in the private sector, where only 18% of the workforce now carries a membership card, the unions will have been transformed into professional service organisations.</p> <p>\"This needn't just be about providing things like insurance,\" says Cridland. \"The downside of negotiating individual contracts is that you're not protected by collective bargaining. Unions in the future are likely to step in to assist individual members to negotiate pay.\"</p> <p>The presence of more women in senior positions and in better-paid professions means the gender pay gap will narrow, but it will not disappear. \"For that to happen would require a major revaluation of the contribution of women at work. We'd have to see the political will for things to change,\" says Alastair Hatchett, the head of pay services at Incomes Data Services.</p> <p>The Work Foundation predicts there will be a major revaluation, however, in the measurement of work. Some method will be found to measure output - the number of books edited or meals served - rather than input, the number of hours spent at your desk, it says. Others, however, are more sceptical. Pearson says: \"Theoretically it's a good idea for output to be measured rather than input but in reality, for the majority of jobs, it just isn't possible to evaluate in an equitable and affordable way. You start getting into value judgements - how do you judge that the output of one person editing a book is better than that of another?\"</p> <p>Finally, to the most important question. Will we be happy in our jobs? Sadly, in spite of all the corporate attempts to woo us, and the chance to work from home a couple of days a week, it seems likely we will be as discontent as ever.</p> <p>\"People are being more intensely critical and demanding about everything. They expect more from their jobs. It could be harder for companies to make people satisfied: they'll do what they think necessary to make people committed and content, but I think they just won't be quick enough on the work-life balance issues,\" predicts Michael White. It seems the technological advances pictured by Keynes may not bring us joy. Look on the bright side though: at least we'll be able to discuss our woes via video-imaging, rather than by standing around the water cooler.</p>",
  "<p>A mouse has moved in under our fridge, and though it looks cute when it pops out to watch us eating, I know it'll have to go.

All agree that you should strive to prevent the problem in the first place. For mice and ants, block up gaps where an intruder might get in, such as those between the skirting and floorboards, and remove even the tiniest bit of food lying around - if there's not food to be had, it's obvious the pests will look elsewhere. </p> <p>With ants, you should then try to follow through by vigorously cleaning where they have made their trail. Among its wide range of tips for disposal of all sorts of pests, the <strong> Pesticide Action Network </strong> (020-7274 8895, <a href=\"http://www.pan-uk.org\">pan-uk.org</a>) advises pouring boiling water over their nests, sealing all food inside airtight containers and sprinkling vinegar or lemon juice over their trails.

According to moth experts <strong> Pest Control Direct </strong> (0845 450 1275, <a href=\"http://www.pestcontroldirect.co.uk\">pestcontroldirect.co.uk</a>), you can kill larvae and eggs by placing clothes in polythene bags and, after squeezing out the air, freezing them for 72 hours. Ironing infested areas (through a tea towel, if the fabric is delicate) is also supposed to do the trick. </p> <p>Again, prevention is easier than cure (at least from an environmental point of view). Environmental groups warn against using moth balls as a deterrent, because of potential health risks from the naphthalene in them. Moths don't like certain strong smells, so there are plenty of alternatives, which makes it all the more baffling why people use moth balls in the first place (why would anyone want their clothes to smell of naphthalene?) <strong> The Natural Collection </strong> (0870 331 3333, <a href=\"http://www.naturalcollection.com\">naturalcollection.com</a>) sells sachets of essential oils to put in clothes drawers, while cedar wood is a popular old-fashioned deterrent - try <strong> Chulmleigh Hardware </strong> (08708 484950, <a href=\"http://www.chulmleigh-hardware.co.uk\">chulmleigh-hardware.co.uk</a>) - as are rosemary and lavender. </p> <p>Never again will I snigger at those home-made lavender bags that are the staple of the village fete. </p> <p>Next month: credit cards.</p>",
  "We all think we know what cosmetic surgery is going to mean to us over the coming years. The path has been pointed out by a series of reality TV shows in which contestants go under the scalpel to look like their favourite celebrity, or have an \"extreme makeover\" at the hands of the surgical team. By 2020, surely, cosmetic surgery is going to be the tool of those who want a new look for their Saturday night out, an adjunct to the make-up compact. <p>Of course, that view rather typecasts cosmetic surgeons as Nip/Tuck merchants out to make a quick buck. The reality is rather different. Plastic surgery is the biggest trauma specialty after orthopedics and its practitioners are primarily concerned with function, not appearance. Its increasing use is because there are more complaints now that can be treated with surgery. And though it will be an even more important branch of medicine by 2020, with dazzling innovation in materials and techniques, it will still be used principally for sound medical reasons.</p> <p>\"It's driven by public demand,\" says David Soutar, a consultant plastic surgeon at Glasgow University and a past president of the British Association of Plastic Surgeons. He points out that even 10 years ago, a plastic surgeon would not have been called to A&amp;E when a child arrived with a cut on their face. Now such a call is routine, as is an offer of reconstruction after surgery on cancer around the breast, face or neck. And legs or fingers that would have been amputated are now expected to be saved. Soutar expects that level of demand to continue.</p> <p>There have been two major brakes on the use of plastic surgery so far, he explains. One is the problem of rejection, which limits the transplant of \"spare parts\" from donors. But the burgeoning field of tissue engineering is creating the possibility of \"tissues to go\", whereby tissues or structures such as ears are grown to order using the patient's own cells, eliminating the possibility of rejection. The mouse with an ear on its back that I introduced to a startled public on Tomorrow's World a decade ago was the start of this revolution, which should be fully realised by 2020. The field has been slower to advance than originally predicted, partly because there is more caution about the introduction of new technologies that are not immediately lifesaving, but that enhance appearance in the otherwise healthy.</p> <p>There are concerns that this approach will only work for elective surgery, for which doctors have time to prepare, but as Simon Withey, a plastic surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital in London, says: \"Even for emergency surgery, it may still be possible to close wounds temporarily, whilst growing new tissue to order.\" He suggests that a development we may see sooner is immunomodulation, in which the recipient receives bone marrow from the donor in advance, thus lessening the chances of rejection when the donor's tissue is introduced. Either way, the ability to grow bone and skin in 3D shapes, both essential to the plastic surgeon's art, will shape the practice of the science.</p> <p>The other big restraint on plastic surgery has been scarring. The shine on a burn victim's face, the loss of full joint function after injury, or the rough raised edges of a graft are all the result of scar tissue. But scar-free healing will be available by 2020. It has long been known that at extremes of life - among newborns and the old - scarring is minimal or, in the case of babies in the womb, non-existent. It is most extensive during adolescence and on certain parts of the body, such as the chest and shoulders. Over the past two decades, the science of wound healing and scar formation has been extensively investigated, principally by Professor Mark Ferguson and his team at Manchester University. Their research has helped in the development of drugs to prevent scarring after healing, and these will be available by 2020. They should have an immense impact on the use of surgery.</p> <p>The techniques, too, are developing rapidly. Withey is part of one of the two teams in the world serious about offering face transplants to the severely disfigured - though don't expect it to be anything like Face/Off. At the moment the disadvantages - the need to take lifelong toxic immunosuppressants after the surgery and the risks of the procedure itself - outweigh the benefits. What's more, the disfigured - rather patronisingly - are felt unable to give proper consent. The work to develop facial transplants has also foundered on the threat it poses to individual identity.</p> <p>As the demand for cosmetic surgery continues to soar, there may be a blurring in the public mind about what constitutes cosmetic and what reconstructive work, with the former being made unavailable on the NHS. But should a 14-year-old who has Poland syndrome, a congenital condition that causes only one breast to develop, have reconstruction available on the NHS, even though it is cosmetic work? Of course, but expect to see NHS funding bodies wriggle all the same. Soutar is clear, though, that cosmetic surgery offers real medical benefits. \"Cosmetic surgery may be more effective and do more for an individual than sewing a leg back on someone that won't ever work properly,\" he says.</p> <p>In fact, the real worry about cosmetic surgery and the NHS is that by 2020 the burgeoning private sector will have taken all the talented surgeons, as has already happened in the US, to the detriment of burns and trauma work in public hospitals.</p> <p>And what of the worry that, by 2020, cosmetic surgery will be an everyday lifestyle choice? Should we take action to prevent that possibility? Perhaps we should instead be asking why stopping people having surgery should be an option: if people are prepared to pay for it and it makes them feel better, then why shouldn't they do so? Professor Sheila McLean, the director of the Institute of Law and Ethics in Medicine at Glasgow University, does not see more cosmetic surgery as an ethical issue for the future, but she worries about what drives people to surgery. \"In an emotionally driven decision, there is every likelihood that people are duressed by an emotional perception of themselves and are unable to give proper consent.\" What concerns her is that, when the expectation levels for what surgery will achieve are so high, the risks must be properly explained.</p> <p>And while consumer demand may benefit patients by increasing what plastic surgery can do for them, the downside is that people think of surgery as a consumer purchase. Changing your appearance becomes the ultimate pick-and-pay choice. That trend will continue, underpinned by future government agendas on choice. But choice or not, some people feel serial patients - such as Jocelyn Wildenstein (below) - should be stopped, in order to avert the prospect of countless others following suit.</p> <p>That view is driven partly by snobbery and partly by envy, but there is also a genuine worry that in a sector dominated by profit, doctors working outside the NHS will say yes to every last demand for knee lift and stomach suction by the surgery junkies, putting their health at risk.</p> <p>So one of the major dilemmas for plastics in 2020 will be trust in doctors. \"Doctors have a legal right to refuse treatment,\" says McLean, \"if they don't think that it is in the best interests of the patient. They are under an obligation to positively do good but also negatively to do no harm.\" There is already a raft of civil and criminal law to protect patients in this regard and the General Medical Council is already noticeably tougher with dodgy cosmetic surgeons than other doctors - so there seems little need to fear cosmetic surgery becoming an ethics-free zone.</p> <p>\"We are a society obsessed by looks,\" observes David Soutar. Don't expect that to change, and expect our own desires to fuel the development of technologies that might make some beautiful. But remember that they will be few: those who benefit from improved function, social acceptance and comfort will be far more, and far more important.</p>",
  "The past 30 years has been a generation of dramatic change in the shape of family life. That pace will not be continued in the next 20. <p>The next two decades will be a period in which already well-established trends are consolidated. That is the consensus among researchers. And all are agreed that by 2020 it will be very hard to talk of a \"typical family\", such will be the variety of shapes and types of families.</p> <p>The most marked characteristic of families since the 1960s has been that the traditional conception of the British family has disintegrated. The married couple with 2.4 children is disappearing. The sequence of life events - marriage, sex and children - has been radically reordered. Marriage rarely comes first and increasingly does not happen at all. Over the past 30 years, levels of cohabitation have trebled, the number of babies born outside marriage has quintupled, and the number of single-parent families has trebled. </p> <p>The most dramatic change, however, has been to the \"happy ever after\" bit in the picture of family life. In the past 30 years, the rate of divorce has doubled; and half of all children now experience their parents' divorce before they are 16. </p> <p>All four trends - cohabitation, divorce, births outside marriage and single parents - are likely to be even more pronounced by 2020. There is no evidence that any of them are easing. Much has been made of the fact that the divorce rate appears to have reached a plateau - Britain has the highest divorce rate in Europe - but it is still rising in first marriages. Cohabitation arrangements are even more likely to break down than marriages. So what will be accepted as a general rule of family life in 2020 will be the brittle nature of the core relationship between the parents. </p> <p>\"There have been 20 years of dramatic change and the diversity of family structures is much greater. The proportion of single-parent families will probably continue to bob around 20%, but there will probably be more stepfamilies in the future,\" says David Utting of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who is also one of the authors of The Handbook of Parenting.</p> <p>While the underlying trends reshaping families will not change, our attitudes to those trends will. The recent period of revolutionary upheaval will bed down into social acceptability. The stigma that used to surround divorce and illegitimacy will be a subject only for the history books. Gay and lesbian partnerships, with rights enshrined in law, will no longer prompt comment. Family life will have adjusted to a pattern of serial monogamy, with a much larger number of stepfamilies. Lone parenthood will be a common phenomenon, but not necessarily a long-lasting one: on average, single parenthood lasts five years now, but that could drop lower by 2020 as the \"churn rate\" of relationship breakdown increases. </p> <p>The diversity of family forms will be striking by 2020. Children living with both their biological parents in the same household will be in the minority. There will be dozens of different types of co-parenting arrangements, with combinations of stepfamilies, or adults with children from previous relationships entering long-term relationships with others in the same position but choosing not to live together.</p> <p>From the vantage point of 2020, there will be some amusement at the heated debates this scenario inspired at the turn of the century. Talk of family breakdown will cause wry smiles as people attribute the kind of moral panic seen in the late 20th century to a particular kind of centennial angst. At least, that is the view of Christina Hardyment, author of The Future of the Family. She argues that the overriding picture is not so much one of family breakdown as of a radical restructuring that allows for just as much emotional commitment as ever.</p> <p>\"There is an alternative view to the doom-laden prophesy that families are falling apart,\" says Hardyment. \"In fact, the future of the family is stronger than ever - all the research shows that families are hugely valued and will continue to be.\"</p> <p>That is borne out by successive British Social Attitude Surveys, which show clearly that while family members live further apart, they turn to each other when important life events take place. Hardyment points to the fact that families are still responsible for the bulk of socialising in British life and that family members talking to each other account for a large proportion of telephone usage. For Hardyment, the most important factor is that \"the relationship between adults is chosen rather than one of economic necessity. That's a tremendous change in the basis of the relationship.\"</p> <p>One of the most dramatic social changes of the past 30 years has been in women's patterns of employment. In the UK the proportion of women in full-time employment has trebled in the past 30 years and maternal employment has leapt from 57% to 65% during the 1990s. With their new economic power, women are able to negotiate more equal relationships - already one in five women earn more than their partners. That proportion is likely to increase over the next decades as a generation of high-achieving schoolgirls arrives in the labour market. Women now make up more than half the intake of traditional professions such as law and medicine. </p> <p>The norm in families now is for one male full-time worker and one female part-time. By 2020, more women will be the primary breadwinner, though that shift will be restricted by the fact that while earning power is being redistributed within the heterosexual couple, caring responsibilities have proved more resistant to change. A disproportionate amount of housework and childcare is still done by women. </p> <p>This renegotiation of the economics of the couple is what the social theorist Anthony Giddens celebrated as the \"pure relationship\" in his Reith Lectures of 1999. He heralded a new era for the family as the old structures of patriarchy, duty and deference crumble to give way to a more democratic model between partners, and between parents and their children. Giddens argued that \"individualisation\" - how people define their identity - shapes family experiences, as people choose to develop only those relationships that promise them emotional integrity. </p> <p>Fiona Williams has led the Care, Values and the Future of Welfare research project at Leeds University for five years. She argues that Giddens' thinking has overstated the extent to which people are atomistic individuals who seek fulfilment in personal relationships. \"There may be seriality in sexual relationships, but that doesn't lead to fragmentation of the family,\" she says. \"People will have different experiences over their lifetimes - of marriage, of cohabitation, of single parenthood - but in many of them they are negotiating complex and deeply held commitments.\" </p> <p>In fact, the major characteristic of the 21st-century family is that the relationship between parents and children has been charged with a much greater intensity, commitment and pleasure. \"Parenting has gained in political, economic and emotional significance,\" says Williams. \"Parents and children have more emotional investment in each other. The issue is the quality of the relationship, not just its functionality. Children and their parents talk of each other as friends whom they can talk to - now, fathers want as much of that quality of relationship as mothers have. The relationship between parents and children has got stronger.\"</p> <p>What goes along with the greater emotional investment is a longer financial dependency. Children used to be off their parents' hands by 18, but the combination of student loans, university fees and rising property prices has already reversed that, and the trend is likely to continue. Parenthood is well on its way to becoming a minimum 25-year deal. The way generations in the family are connected by vertical links is sometimes characterised as the \"beanpole family\" - long and thin. As family sizes shrink, the number of siblings and cousins will dwindle while the intergenerational relationships become more intense. That beanpole family will present the state with some particular challenges in the 2020s, adds Williams. The strength of the parent-child relationship might mean that today's children will expect a lot of support from the state to care for their aged parents. Meanwhile, grandparents will want to help with the care of their grandchildren but will have to carry on working to fund their pensions. </p> <p>Many researchers believe the past 30 years have seen not so much the breakdown of the family as its reinvention. The baby-boomers adapted family structures in line with their aspirations to autonomy, self-definition and emotional integrity. Over the course of a generation, they have taken the family unit apart rather as a car mechanic might an engine. The great shibboleths of western family life have been dismantled: sex and marriage used to be interlinked - as did marriage and children, as did heterosexuality and marriage. Those links have been broken and people can assemble the bits as they wish: the worth accorded to individual autonomy has hugely increased and will continue to grow. </p> <p> Despite the moral panic generated by these shifts, one aspect of the reinvented family that has been less controversial - in relative terms - has been the delinking of genetic material and parenthood. Donated semen to help couples in which the man is infertile has been used since the 1960s, and donated eggs are a common part of infertility treatment. Test-tube babies and surrogate mothers are no longer a novelty. What has been firmly established is that parenthood does not always entail direct genetic inheritance; the bonding and strength of relationship is not determined by common genetic material. </p> <p>But the strong resistance in British public opinion to some developments of reproductive technologies - such as cloning and choosing a baby's characteristics, the creation of so-called designer babies - shows no sign of abating. By 2020, the techniques to develop a cloned embryo will almost certainly exist (the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has already given a centre in Newcastle the go-ahead to begin research) and will probably be practised elsewhere in the world. It will be almost impossible for the government to prevent people becoming fertility tourists, travelling to find the treatment they want. But it is a moot point as to whether public opinion will have shifted to allow parents these choices in their own country.</p> <p>The baby-boomers' reinvention of family has ensured that increasingly there will be no collective narrative about how intimate relationships should be structured and the order in which major life events should unfold. Adulthood will not carry with it expectations of achieving certain relationship milestones, such as getting married or becoming a parent. But while the options for personal freedom will have been enormously enlarged, that will bring with it a degree of confusion and disorientation, because individuals' wishes are sure, in many cases, to conflict: to have children or not; to marry or not; to stick together or separate. Without norms, some individuals will happily negotiate their way through the choices, but others will find it more difficult. </p> <p>Despite the rising tolerance of relationship breakdown and divorce, there is still a tremendous attachment to the ideal of a stable, lifelong commitment, points out Mary MacLeod, chief executive of the National Family and Parenting Institute. The vast majority of people tell surveys they want to spend their life with one other person. Children, in particular, are very attached to living in a household with both their mother and father. MacCleod acknowledges it is \"troubling\" that, in effect, children's expectations of family life are not, and increasingly will not be, met. There is some evidence we are getting better at divorcing - there is still a long way to go - but there is no getting away from the fact that the serial monogamy of the future will be disruptive and difficult for children. Research has already shown that children of divorced parents have, on average, a lower rate of educational achievement and higher incidence of mental health problems in adulthood. There will be increasing pressure on couples to achieve a \"good divorce\" for the sake of their children.</p> <p>The increased freedom of the reinvented family has also brought a doubling in single-person households and a sharp rise in the proportion of childless women. In part, these developments are attributable to increased choice but, in part, it is the cost that is paid for choice. In a significant minority of people's lives by 2020, family will not play a major role and friendship will be much more important in these people's emotional lives. Those friendships may often entail strong commitment to mutual support so friends can help each other through life crises. For many in 2020, \"significant others\" will be as likely to refer to a few close friends as a husband or mother. </p> <p>But the attenuated family structures will leave some vulnerable. Loneliness and depression will be more common, and some groups, such as the elderly, will be particularly vulnerable. As geographical mobility continues to spread families over greater distances and the smaller family size increases the dependency of the elderly on their one or two children, loneliness in the final decades of our longer lives will be a huge issue. Given that women live longer than men, they will be disproportionately affected; by 2020 we will be discussing the feminisation of loneliness and searching for strategies to develop greater peer sociability to compensate. </p> <p>The ageing of the British population by 2020 will be a major political and social issue - the number of people over pensionable age will increase from 10.9 million now to 13.2million in 2026. But the workers of 2020 will be bracing themselves for an even older age profile when they retire, because we are expected to reach the peak of 15 million pensioners in 2040. </p> <p>We know we will work for longer and live for longer. But the big unknown is how the medical treatment and care we need in our old age will be financed. Utting points to research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that indicates that by 2020 the funding implications for care will be acute. Will taxes have to rise to pay for the number of heart operations needed for octogenarians? These will be the dilemmas for the electorate in the 2020s. Alongside financing the huge costs of medical treatment will be the enormous challenge of funding the much more prosaic matter of caring for the frail elderly - dressing them, cooking their meals, doing their housework and helping them to wash. By 2020, we will be in the middle of the debate on the care deficit. This could be the single most difficult issue facing the family in the 21st century. </p> <p>Historically, women were responsible for care within the family. They raised the children and cared for the elderly according to the traditional, early-20th-century model. But the transfer of their labour from the family to the paid economy has opened up a care deficit. That is one part of family life the baby-boomers singularly failed to reinvent. Women are still expected to take on the bulk of the care responsibilities within the family and some research indicates that men (particularly those in professional jobs) are now doing fewer household chores and less childcare than they did 20 years ago. What is fuelling the care deficit is the growing pressure of long hours at work. The number of long-hour workers in the UK has doubled in the past five years to 26% of the workforce. </p> <p>At the moment, the centre of the debate over the care deficit is how to care for children, which is likely to be a major issue at the next general election as demand grows on the state to step in and help families with this part of the care deficit. As birth rates decline dramatically in countries such as Spain and Italy, the European Union will add to the domestic pressure in the UK for the government to adopt family-friendly policies, including state childcare provision and greater encouragement for flexible working. By 2020, it is possible that the childcare question will have been solved - there will be enough provision and the state will ensure it's affordable - but another part of the care deficit, the care of the elderly and chronically ill, will be provoking much greater concern. </p> <p>On every aspect of the care deficit over the coming decades, people will turn to technology for help. Japan, which has the highest proportion of those over 60 in the world, has already pioneered the kind of remote, web-based technology that can administer health checks such as taking a pulse rate and measuring blood pressure. There will be moves to further extend the role of technology in providing care.</p> <p>Webcams might by 2020 be playing the role the telephone did in the 20th century, a vital communication link for families who might live hundreds of miles apart. Already some nurseries are linked up to their parents' office by webcam so they can see their children at play. More and more communication within the family is likely to be mediated by technology - the internet, email or the mobile phone. Already, technology has facilitated the family life of people who have migrated from their home country. For example, a South African nurse working in the UK can now be involved in daily decisions about the upbringing of her children and care of her parents. Involvement in family life no longer requires geographical proximity.</p> <p>Technology will alleviate some of the loneliness arising from the care deficit, but it can offer few solution to the basics of sustaining a person's daily life. There have been suggestions that robots could be programmed to respond to a baby's crying and that they could play a role in the care of tiny babies. But there will be strong cultural reservations about such an idea, reinforced by the emerging research on the importance of affection towards babies in the development of their brains in the first year, so it is hard to see robot nannies being a major feature of family life. </p> <p>The big problem in 2020 will be to find the workforce to meet the care needs of families. It is predicted that by 2020 the US will absorb the entire global workforce of nurses, such will be the demand of its ageing population for medical care. It will be able to offer high enough wages to poach them from all over the world. </p> <p>The declining birth rate in many European countries - Britain's has been declining also but at a slower rate - will post the acute problem of finding enough people to care for their ageing populations. Perhaps governments will finally have to tackle the chronic low pay and low status of care work to recruit sufficient numbers. Or perhaps they will adopt the short-term solution of importing care, allowing women migrant workers on short-term contracts to staff our nurseries, old people's homes and hospitals.</p> <p>We do not yet know. But whatever course policymakers choose, they - and we - face some tough challenges.</p> <p><b>Madeleine Bunting is a Guardian columnist and the author of Willing Slaves: How the Overwork Culture is Ruling Our Lives (HarperCollins, \u00a312.99)</b></p>",

  "<p>I'm not sure what kind of history they teach nowadays in English schools. There seems to have been a reaction against the extremes of political correctness that prevailed until a few years ago, for now even the empire has begun to strike back. </p> <p>But I feel fairly confident that Sir Peregrine Worsthorne's recent essay, In Defence Of Aristocracy, is not yet a standard textbook. I doubt our history teachers are ready to follow his lead in crediting the hereditary nobility with all that is good in British society. </p> <p>In Italy, on the other hand, Tony Blair's friend Silvio Berlusconi has wasted no time in putting the schools' history curriculum to rights. Italian school textbooks are being rewritten to eliminate leftwing bias and to follow \"objective criteria that respect historical truth\". </p> <p>Here, provided by the historian Paul Ginsborg in his excellent new book about the Italian prime minister (Silvio Berlusconi, Verso, \u00a316), is one of the first products of this pursuit of objectivity. It is a passage from a new history textbook, aimed at 14-year-olds, about the first decades of Italian unity after 1870. </p> <p>\"The men of the Right were aristocrats and great landowners,\" it reads. \"They entered politics with the sole intention of serving the State, not to enrich themselves or climb up the social ladder. Furthermore, they administered the finances of the State with the same attention and parsimony with which they cared for their own patrimonies. </p> <p>\"The men of the Left, on the other hand, are [note change of tense] professionals, entrepreneurs and lawyers, ready to further their careers in any way. Sometimes they sacrifice the good of the Nation to their own interests. The great difference between the governments of the Right and those of the Left consists above all in their diverse moral and political attitudes.\" </p> <p>There you have it, then. We've all been quite wrong to credit people on the left in politics with good intentions. On the contrary, they are all self-centred, money-grubbing social climbers. Only those on the right care about the welfare of the nation and its citizens. </p> <p>It is odd of Berlusconi to be so admiring of aristocrats, when he himself is a self-made man, and so dismissive of entrepreneurs, when he is one of the most successful of modern times. Perhaps, with his vast properties and estates, he feels he has joined the aristocracy and put entrepreneurship behind him. </p> <p>In any case, he clearly feels that his right-wing government is being gravely misjudged because of the leftwing historical bias being taught in schools. Perhaps our own rightwing government feels similarly misunderstood. </p> <p>It will fall to some future British government to rewrite the history of the period we are currently living through, perhaps to a government led in 50 years' time by Leo Blair, eager to rehabilitate his father. </p> <p>\"At the end of the 20th century and during the early tumultuous years of the 21st, Britain was fortunate to be ruled by a party, known as New Labour, that cared only for the good of the nation,\" a new textbook might read. \"Its leader, Tony Blair, sought office not for personal advantage but to bring honesty and integrity into government. </p> <p>\"His purpose was to banish the corruption and 'sleaze' that had characterised the previous government of the so-called Conservatives, a party once dominated by high-minded aristocrats but later taken over by lawyers and entrepreneurs who sought to sacrifice the good of the Nation to their own interests. </p> <p>\"Tony Blair, in the aristocratic tradition, always put the Nation first, whatever the cost to his personal popularity. He courageously took the Nation to war against Iraq, despite cowardly claims by his opponents that this Middle Eastern country posed no threat to Britain, since it had neither weapons of mass destruction nor links to international terrorism. </p> <p>\"Conscious that, given time, it might acquire both, he farsightedly launched a pre-emptive attack which, despite the loss of life and mayhem that ensued, made sure that Britain would be spared any eventual danger from that quarter. </p> <p>\"He also restored the integrity of the House of Lords by ousting its degenerate hereditary members, resisting demands for direct election that would have peopled it with ambitious lawyers and entrepreneurs, and filling it instead with his own appointees - or 'Tony's cronies' as his opponents offensively called them - whose altruism could not be doubted. </p> <p>\"Not least among his virtues was a commitment to civilised values, which caused him to abolish the barbaric practice of foxhunting. Some people claimed that fishing and shooting were just as cruel, and that to single out foxhunting was to punish a particular minority that he found distasteful. But he treated such objections with the contempt they deserved.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you've ever wondered about the exact location of the state frontier, it's the counter of your local post office.

According to Patrick Collinson we are the idle, privileged rich and hysterical about the tax.

  "On a short concrete jetty in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a dozen judges and court officials took their first steps on Pitcairn Island yesterday, helped by the very people they have been sent to judge. <p>It was a hot, calm day and people wore shorts and T-shirts while legal documents, food supplies, books and people were handed down from a sleek white yacht and ferried to shore in longboats and dinghies. </p> <p>The lawyers are here to try seven Pitcairn men - four of them direct descendants of the mutineers on HMS Bounty, who settled on the island in 1790 in flight from a British naval court-martial - who have been charged with 96 counts of sexual abuse. </p> <p>The charge sheet stretches from the 1960s to 1998 and includes 31 counts of rape, as well as charges for indecent assault, gross indecency on a child and unlawful sexual intercourse. </p> <p>The remains of HMS Bounty still lie 10ft beneath the breaking surf, just a stone's throw from the Bounty Bay jetty where the judges disembarked. Two mutineers set fire to it in 1790 as a final severance of links with the outside world, but today British law is back on Pitcairn with a vengeance. </p> <p>Residents claim that the trial could result in the abandonment of this 2 sq mile British territory 4,000 miles from the nearest continent, after 214 years of almost continuous occupation. </p> <p>\"The Pitcairn people want justice, but they would like a justice that does not tear their island completely apart,\" says Herb Ford, director of the US-based Pitcairn Islands Study Centre. \"This trial done in this traditional downtown London mode is going to rip this place so far apart that you're going to be lucky to see anyone on Pitcairn a year or two from now.\" </p> <p>The sea was calm and the sky dappled with broken cloud yesterday, but Pitcairn's rocky coastline can be so windswept and treacherous that visitors and supplies must be ferried between the jetty and boats moored offshore. Many residents fear that these supply missions would be impossible if more than half of Pitcairn's able-bodied men were locked up inside the newly-constructed Adamstown jail. </p> <p>Publicity surrounding the five-year investigation and trial process has already damaged Pitcairn's image as a south sea paradise, but it has been many years since life here was the simplistic idyll praised in Victorian sermons. </p> <p>Locals get around on quad bikes and live in prefab bungalows. Diesel fuel to power the islands generators and vehicles make up the bulk of the supplies brought in from passing freight ships. </p> <p>All but a handful of Pitcairners have visited New Zealand, Australia, Europe or the US. Most houses have internet connections and exchange a steady flurry of emails with friends and relatives in the outside world. Pitcairn's primary school teaches the New Zealand syllabus, and children usually go to secondary schools in Auckland. </p> <p>But the population has dropped from a high of 200 in 1936 to just 47 now, alongside seven outsiders working as police, social workers, administrators, doctors and pastors. The 25 lawyers, officials and journalists attending the trial will push Pitcairn's population to its highest level since the 1960s. </p> <p>Islanders argue that they are still relatively green to the ways of the outside world. </p> <p>\"They come out for a few months to visit relatives and for medical treatment, but they are mostly in their Pitcairn environment with relatives out here,\" says Kari Young, a Norwegian-born Pitcairner who divides her time between Auckland and Pitcairn. \"They don't live the New Zealand life, they don't get much involved in the big politics.\" </p> <p>This disconnect is at the heart of the dispute over Pitcairn's law. Islanders say they have their own legal system, which dates to an 1838 constitution, has been used to try hundreds cases on the island and is contained in a 1971 book of legal code traditionally kept in the island office. </p> <p>They argue that the 1956 British sexual offences act, under which the seven defendants will be tried next week, is usurping laws that have been dealing with sexual offences on Pitcairn since the 1960s. The most recent such case was in 1999, when a 19-year-old New Zealander was sentenced to 100 days imprisonment for \"having carnal knowledge\" of a 15-year-old girl. That trial sparked the investigation, led by Kent policewoman Gail Cox, that has now landed seven islanders in Adamstown's dock. </p> <p>Islanders have pushed for some form of restorative justice to be taken, but the option has been turned down by governor Richard Fell.</p> <p>\"Because this has gone so far, the police and Pitcairn governor have to show some results, no matter how much it hurts the community,\" wrote one island resident, who did not wish to be identified, in an email to the Guardian this week. \"Since 1999 Pitcairn laws have been disregarded and English ones put in place, usually without Pitcairn input or practicality,\" she wrote.</p> <p>\"We are not a metropolitan city or even somewhere you can usually 'liken' our living conditions to. When a new problem came up [in the past] a new ordinance or law was put in place. In short I think the whole set of laws we have now are a farce.\" </p> <p>The bulk of the charges are believed to relate to underage sex, and most locals admit that sexual customs in Pitcairn have traditionally been different to those in Britain. But islanders point to the worldwide variation in age of consent laws, which are as low as 12 and 13 in Spain and parts of Latin America, and argue that to bring the full force of British justice to bear on Pitcairn is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. </p> <p>There are also deep concerns about the conduct of the three-year investigation. Several witnesses have withdrawn their statements after claiming that they had been coerced by New Zealand police and offered compensation as an incentive, in one case resulting in a complaint from the Norwegian ambassador. </p> <p>British law has only ever been used in one previous criminal case on Pitcairn, the murder trial of Harry Christian in 1897. Islanders say it was only invoked on that occasion because the island's legal code - much of which is concerned with seemingly trivial issues such as the correct way to kill a chicken - had no laws dealing with murder. </p> <p>\"All through the 200 years it's been the Pitcairn law book that has ruled the island,\" says Kari Young. \"That's all the Pitcairners have ever known. It was kept in the office and everyone could go and leaf through it. Until quite recently there's never been a British law book there.\" </p> <p>There is a clause in the 1971 legal code mentioning that British law applies in Pitcairn, but islanders say they had no means of referring to statutes passed 9,300 miles away until a full set of British law books was brought to the island in 2001. The trial, they argue, violates the legal principle of \"nulla poena sine lege\" (no punishment without a law). </p> <p>Arguments over the legality of the trial have raged in New Zealand courtrooms - reconsecrated as Pitcairn's supreme court and court of appeal - for nearly two years. The dispute will go before the Privy Council in London next month, but Pitcairn supreme court justice Russell Johnson said the appeal would not be likely to succeed. </p> <p>\"You'll be asking the Privy Council, in the death throes of the British Empire, to overturn the colonial law which has applied forever,\" he said.</p>",
  "Twenty-five years a social democratic city councillor and a party member all his adult life, Bernd Muelhaupt recently gave up the council work and is grappling with his conscience over whether to quit his party, too. <p>The reason for the dilemma can be summed up in two words: Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. </p> <p>\"He's destroying this party,\" says the D\u00fcsseldorf economist. \"So many elections lost. So many careers wasted. He doesn't follow social democratic policies. All he cares about is his own power. I know so many good people who have thrown away their party cards. I often think of doing the same.\" </p> <p>Mr Muelhaupt's crisis of conscience mirrors the crisis confronting Europe's biggest and oldest social democratic party as Mr Schr\u00f6der, the chancellor, marks six years in power, halfway through his second term. </p> <p>Last weekend in the eastern German state of Saxony, the social democrats [SPD] slumped to single figures, just over 9%, the worst party performance in a state election ever. </p> <p>In nine regional elections in a row since Mr Schr\u00f6der narrowly secured a second term in 2002, the social democrats have taken a pounding. </p> <p>In recent weeks, Mr Schr\u00f6der has been smeared with eggs and punched in the face. Tens of thousands of people, mainly in eastern Germany, have been taking to the streets every Monday to demonstrate against his policies, which in many respects are further to the right than those espoused by factions of the conservative opposition. </p> <p>Around 100,000 members have quit the SPD since Mr Schr\u00f6der came to power in 1998, 43,000 of them in protest in the 18 months since he announced his big idea: Agenda 2010, an ambitious programme of budget and welfare cuts aimed at shaking up an economy and a culture long in the doldrums. </p> <p>Tomorrow looks likely to serve up the latest ordeal. </p> <p>The crucial state of North-Rhine Westphalia, of which D\u00fcsseldorf is the capital, stages municipal and local authority elections, presaging the state election here next May which could determine Mr Schr\u00f6der's fate. </p> <p>The state is crucial because with 17m, it is Germany's biggest. Once the industrial heartland of Germany with its coal and steel sectors, it is also the bedrock of German social democracy. The SPD has governed here continuously for almost 40 years, since 1966. </p> <p>But with unemployment in the state running at almost 11% and the poor, the marginalised, and increasingly also the middle classes frightened of and outraged at Mr Schr\u00f6der's plans to slash unemployment benefit from next year, the opinion polls predict a devastating 30% for the SPD and victory for the opposition Christian Democrats. </p> <p>A high abstention rate is also predicted, with voters thoroughly disillusioned with establishment politics everywhere in Germany. </p> <p>\"The real SPD voters will stay away in protest,\" says Mr Muelhaupt. </p> <p>\"For the past 18 months, the government's ratings have been weaker than ever,\" says Klaus-Peter Schoeppner, chief of the Emnid polling agency. \"The economy's disastrous, there's high unemployment, there's a lack of credibility in politics. We're recording the highest levels of public anxiety ever.\" </p> <p>Amid this national mood of intense gloom and insecurity, the surprise is that the chancellor has seldom appeared so confident, so relaxed and so self-assured, as if he knows something that the rest of Germany does not. </p> <p>\"We don't need to tighten our belts so much as roll up our sleeves,\" he told the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper in an interview on Thursday. </p> <p>\"He's got nothing to lose. He's so far down, he can only go up,\" says Claus Leggewie, a political scientist at Giessen University. \"And he's been through all this before.\" </p> <p><b> Disillusioned voters</b><br> </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der has long been viewed as a formidable political tactician - opportunistic, shrewd and pragmatic. </p> <p>He came from behind to win his second term two years ago by exploiting German opposition to the Iraq war and through his energy on television handling a flooding emergency in eastern Germany. </p> <p>What is new is the steely resolve. </p> <p>Last November, he let it be known that he would rather stick to his painful prescription for welfare reform - the paramount issue in Germany by far - and be punished at the ballot box than give in to the entrenched resistance to welfare reforms and cuts. </p> <p>He has stuck to his guns ever since and that approach appears to be paying dividends with a public that is slowly and grudgingly admitting he may be right, as well as gaining respect from a party grassroots that loathes him ideologically, but admires his prowess at winning elections. </p> <p>Mr Schoeppner, the pollster, says that his surveys are detecting a shift in mood in recent weeks. \"It's a fading of the Christian Democrats rather than a strengthening of the SPD.\" </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der is also benefiting from displaying \"toughness, persistence, and statesmanship, the message that the entire nation is more important than the party.\" </p> <p>The conservative and politically astute mass tabloid, Bildzeitung, commented last week: \"It's two long years to the next election. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's political end is not yet sealed.\" </p> <p>The SPD is still lagging 15 points behind the opposition in the national polls, but only a few months ago the gap was nearly double that. The Bild verdict echoed the cautiously favourable coverage Mr Schr\u00f6der is receiving from influential parts of the conservative media. </p> <p>Over beer and sausages at an SPD election rally this week in the small town of Dormagen half an hour from D\u00fcsseldorf, Dieter, a company lawyer and SPD stalwart, admitted: \"Of course, the [welfare] reforms are long overdue. Everybody knows that. The Christian Democrats are just lucky they're in opposition and not carrying the can for the reforms.\" </p> <p>The SPD state prime minister, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, complained that in Germany the glass is always seen to be half-empty, never half-full and he bemoaned \"the German culture of outrage\". </p> <p>The SPD, he declared, \"has been on the ropes for months with a number of heavy defeats\", but the national mood was now shifting. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der enjoys the advantage of incumbency, pertinent in a country that rarely votes out a sitting chancellor, and he is also benefiting from the infighting and disarray among the opposition over the very same issues of welfare, health service, and pensions reform. </p> <p>The opinion polls consistently show little confidence in the Christian Democrats making a better fist of the reforms than the chancellor. </p> <p>And when it comes to personality politics, the governing duo of Mr Schr\u00f6der and Joschka Fischer, the leader of the SPD's coalition partner, the Greens, is twice as popular as the alternative duo of Angela Merkel, the CDU leader, and Guido Westerwelle, leader of the liberal Free Democrats. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der's challenges are immense. The economy has been stagnating for years. Unemployment, currently 4.6 million, is becoming a semi-permanent condition. </p> <p><b> Favourable coverage</b><br> </p> <p> Despite routine injunctions from politicians for people to look for jobs, a central bank survey in August found there were only some 250,000 vacancies in the country. </p> <p>Jobs are the key test for a chancellor who inherited four million unemployed from Helmut Kohl in 1998 and said he should be measured on whether he brought down unemployment. The economy is picking up slightly and is expected to grow at just under 2% a year over the next few years. </p> <p>Mr Leggewie thinks that will not be enough to generate jobs, while Mr Schoeppner fears Germany may be entering a phase of \"jobless growth\". </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der appears to be calculating that the cuts in unemployment benefit will be accepted by the time of the election in 2006 and be beginning to have an effect. </p> <p>The local elections tomorrow in North-Rhine Westphalia look likely to confirm that Mr Schr\u00f6der is very much down, but not at all out. </p> <p><b>The peaks and troughs</b></p> <p><b> The highs</b><br> <b>\u00b7</b> His is a rags-to-riches story: he left school at 14 and became the family breadwinner. He worked at a hardware store and studied law in the evenings </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> He was the first MP not to wear a tie at the dispatch box, to illustrate how far removed politics was from the 'real lives of young people' </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> He became leader of the Young Socialists in 1978 and led protests for leftwing causes, including opposition to the US war in Vietnam </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> After winning the elections in 1998, his popularity ratings were more than 60% </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This year he adopted a six-year-old orphan from Russia </p> <p><b> The lows</b><br> <b>\u00b7</b> In February 2003 he was dubbed the \"lonely chancellor\" as his support plummeted and he became isolated from colleagues and international allies due to his anti-war stance. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A year earlier, the chancellor sued the DPP news agency over claims that he dyed his hair dark brown </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Married four times, he has been divorced three and pays alimony to all his ex-wives.

  "<p>It was 2am. I'd been in Melbourne for 24 sleepless hours and was still wide-awake, feeling as though I were missing out on the essential glamour of a Lost In Translation moment because my low-rise hotel didn't have views of the city. Instead of raiding the mini-bar, I went for a nightcap at a sleepy local pub called Rush - a misnomer if ever there was one. Rain came down in Hollywood torrents, the wind whipped up and I began to question the wisdom of leaving Blighty's so-so summer for Melbourne's grey winter. </p> <p>At three-ish, I returned to the Lyall Hotel - a triumph of beige suede over good taste - turned the TV on and thought I was hallucinating when a woman said, in all seriousness: \"I've had an iconic wardrobing experience.\" Iconic? Wardrobing? </p> <p>Later, in a restaurant, I was told that eggs benedict, \"is our iconic dish, you'll be sure to have a fine-dining experience.\" Melbourne feels strangely Parisian, New York-ish and San Franciscan. It's because of the street cafes and news vendors, towers, grid system and trams - a beguiling urban identikit that makes for an attractive whole. There's also a hint of LA, in the wealthy suburb of South Yarra, and of course a splash of Ramsay Street elsewhere. </p> <p>Cranes stand all over the place, saluting building sites like so many anorexic Statues of Liberty, gaudy lights winking at the top of their extended arms. If it was possible to plump-up, Botox or lift a city's visage, then I'd describe Melbourne's face as well and truly tucked; it's had radical surgery. Squeaky and new, the good-looking veneer pulled tight, it has been thoroughly made-over, giving new life to its Victorian past. </p> <p>New people, too, like Hank, a Dutchman who speaks \"Strine\" with a Flemish drawl and wears crimson patent leather ankle boots and maroon socks with tweeds - a dazzling combo. As the proprietor of the Aboriginal Gallery of Dreamings, or AGOD, he is on a crusade to promote and, of course, flog Aboriginal art. </p> <p>Many people, Hank included, claim a very personal stake on Aboriginal artists and tell tales of how they personally encouraged, discovered or promoted certain individuals. It's as if Aboriginal art has become totemic in itself - a white totem, a middle-class badge of liberal respectability. Some of the artists Hank represents are extraordinary, as is his apparent grasp of the symbolism, nuance and intricacy of the different native cultures and styles. His enthusiasm is infectious, he's a man possessed, evangelical and verging on the combustible. I was entranced and had to steel my resolve to escape without buying anything - there again, if I'd had a spare A$100,000 the story might have been quite different. </p> <p>A quick escape wasn't easy, the pedestrians in Melbourne are probably the best behaved in the world and patiently wait in orderly queues for the green man to flash. I'm unused to such municipal obedience. </p> <p>Victoria's capital does weekends better than any other days of the week. Wealthy locals might drive up to Daylesford, a peculiar town that is famed for an unlikely combination of health spas, a large gay community and locally grown organic food - produced no doubt by the lesbian WI after an invigorating salt-scrub. It's also home to the chi-chi Lake House Hotel and its second- to-none wine cellar. Owner Alla Wolf-Tasker, a terrifying woman gated behind enormous spectacles and a shock of big black hair, extolled the virtues of all who worked for her, including the groundsman. \"He's the Australian shooting champion, and often takes out guests,\" she said. I know how he must feel, and regret not having the use of a sawn-off shotgun myself. </p> <p>For those who remain in town, Melbourne is a city that brunches - conspicuously so. Small groups of Melbournites, box fresh, newly streaked and well-shod, ruminate together on Chapel Street below the evocative, colonial Victorian shop facades before making their choice of restaurant. On Saturday and Sunday mornings, all the swanky eateries are full; smoked salmon &amp; scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, bagels and croissants filling, in turn, the diners. It's inevitably a family affair - children, very much part of Melbourne's culture of youth, feature heavily - an almost Mediterranean mentality. </p> <p> T hose hungering for culture are catered for, too: a leisurely amble to Federation Square does the trick. The newly built arts centre and public space is unremittingly hideous from the outside, but quite stupendous within. Fabulous interiors are splintered, labyrinthine and engaging, a bit like walking into a film maker's version of an art space: huge galleries with a permanent and excellent exhibition of Aboriginal art are beautifully hung and lit. And with hardly any punters to spoil the view, the space becomes even more airy and dreamy. I momentarily shudder as the words iconic and experience pop into my head. </p> <p>The good denizens are as proud of Federation Square as they are of the municipality in general. I got a powerful sense not just of community, but of care for the environment, too - the streets are incredibly clean. Likewise I felt the standard of living was high, the happiness threshold was regularly tipped and general satisfaction quotient was sated. Melbourne's history of radical trade unionism and politics somehow doesn't come across to the casual visitor enveloped in overwhelming niceness. It felt a bit illusory and saccharine, but then perhaps my jetlag was kicking in again. </p> <p>The Adelphi Hotel on Flinders Lane is the trendy, shiny haunt of fashion folk, designers and rock stars. A cantilevered swimming pool juts out 10 stories above the pavement below; the pared down interiors feel ever so slightly monastic. Everything, including the stainless steel furniture has been especially designed for the hotel. Teething problems meant heavy metal coffee tables and chairs with lethal edges were given shin pads. One wit described the additions as \"avant guards\". But isn't a place like this is designed to separate the haves from the avants? </p> <p>I met a couple called Robert and Jim in a pub called Vic's. The bar area was a bit like the set for an alcoholic version of Friends, chummy, intimate and slightly unreal. It's certainly none the worse for that. I mentioned my take on Melbourne's niceness and expanded it with my theory that street violence felt remote and unlikely. Jim boasted that the biggest problem was internal Mafia gang violence - there have been 26 deaths in the past few months. The statistic came as a peculiar relief. </p> <p>Caffe e Cucina is a Melbourne institution on Chapel Street famed for attracting the stars as well as for its exuberant waiters. Good food and wine is dispensed with much Italianate theatre and shouting. The Kiwi waiter serving me gave a bravura performance but sheepishly admitted that even though his accent was pretty good, he still had none of the language. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> </p> <p>Singapore Airlines (08706 088886, <a href=\"http://www.singaporeair.co.uk\">singaporeair.co.uk</a>) flies to Melbourne from \u00a3665 inc tax. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay:</strong> A Studio Suite at The Lyall Hotel (+3 9868 8222, <a href=\"http://www.thelyall.com\">thelyall.com</a>) costs from \u00a3159 per night (room only). </p> <p><strong> Further information: </strong> Tourism Australia on 09068 633235 for a free Travellers' Guide (calls 60p per minute). </p> <p>Flight time London-Melbourne via Singapore: 24hrs. <br>Country code: 0061. <br>Time difference: +9hrs. <br>\u00a31 = 2.45 Australian dollars.</p>",
  "<p>I'm a journey man, looking for arms at night, 20 years. Circling, London town. You might have seen me? Even got me. In and out, this way and that. I'm a black cab driver chasing his own tail, fishing late into the night with his yellow light burning bright, waiting to be taken into the blue, capture, with the meter running.</p> <p> But wait up; me and my girls are off. We've already got bags. Different sizes for different backs. </p> <p>\"What about school?\" \"'What about there education?\" The \"what abouts\" can stay at home. We haven't told the school yet. I'm going to walk in with a straight back, and clean teeth, like a gun slinger, with his smile. The head's going to be rattling on and on. And I'm going to say. \"Hold up, were off.\" And gently close that door.</p> <p>The girls are going to write journals and see what they see, eyeing different eyes. Swimming with dolphins, watching kick boxing, and stand by the side as Buddhas walk gently past. Beggars and bowlers, old and young. </p> <p>My back's getting yoga, even though when I stretch I fart. We're travel on trains, and the back of trucks watching colours and heat go past with conversation as a friend. Slowly moving in Asia, this way and that, tip toeing feet. Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.</p> <p>Then on to Australia and bloodstone boots. Buying a banger, hitting the dust. Kangaroos to hit, kolas to save. We'll have arguments and tears, but on certain days, we're going to be alive. On to New Zealand, looking at deco and tat, high mountains, clear water and clouds doing their thing. Then over the Pacific, to the land of popcorn bellies and chewing gum where winners take all. Giants of men, Sequoias reaching the sky. Down the coast to Mexico for Spanish, served up as a family dish. We'll learn and go to Spanish school. But we've got a ticking clock, I reckon that's the six months up.</p>",
  "<p>I lay back on the floor of my canoe and looked up at the cloud-studded sky, a fringe of dark green conifers swaying at the edge of my vision. The rise-and-fall hum of a speed boat passed somewhere in the distance. Closing my eyes I waited, and sure enough, the waves of its wake arrived, a liquid echo slapping against the hull of my canoe, rocking me gently into a warm, contented mid-afternoon doze. I allowed myself to feel a little smug. I said it could be done, and here I was, on my long weekend in Canada. Canoe? Check. Fir trees? Check. Glass-flat lake stretching into the distance? Check. Speed boats ... well, we'll get to them later. </p> <p>A long weekend in Canada. To be fair, it's not a sentence you often hear, so I understood why some of my friends looked at me as if I'd lost it. But, I assured them, it isn't as stupid as it sounds. At only six hours away, Toronto is as close as New York, and shoppers and stag parties don't think twice about going there for the weekend. So why not a weekend on the lakes of Ontario, a little shopping for the soul in the Canadian Shield instead of the department stores and boutiques of Manhattan? </p> <p>For the last 150 years, the urbanites of Ontario have been flocking to the shores of the great inland seas that are the Ontario lakes. This is what the Canadians call \"cottage country\" (and yes, what I'm doing is in theory \"cottaging\" as I find out to my surprise when I open the local paper to find an advertisement with two men standing outside a wooden house beneath a banner promising \"The Best of Cottaging\"!) Every weekend throughout the summer months, the highways north and east of Toronto bulk out with SUVs and trucks towing jet skis, speedboats and other watery outdoor stuff as families and couples escape the heat of the city for the swimming, fishing and cool breezes of lake country. Think New York and the Hamptons; only this being Canada, it's a more natural, more egalitarian and more, well, wholesome version of its American counterpart. </p> <p>Boarding my flight for Toronto on the Thursday afternoon (OK, so this is a long, long weekend) I'm sure I can get a slice of this Canadian weekend dream, but by the Friday morning, I'm not so convinced. </p> <p>It started at the airport. The chipper immigration officer asks where I'm going this weekend. \"Georgian Bay Islands national park,\" I proudly tell him. \"Oh, the Park Officers are on strike this weekend,\" he says cheerfully, \"Have a great day now!\" (In Canada, it seems, times and days are \"great\" as opposed to the American \"nice\" ... a significant difference I feel.) Then on Friday there was the drive north out of Toronto, through unpromising flat farming country and sheets of rain supplemented by the vicious backwash of SUV tyres. </p> <p>Things begin to look up, though, once I'm off the highway. The roads become undulating gravel tracks and home-made signs point down even smaller tracks to the rural promises of Getaway Cottage and Lakeside Cabin. My hopes are lifted further as the sun comes out when I arrive at Severn Lodge, a small resort on the eastern shore of Gloucester Pool in the Muskoka-Georgian Bay Lake area. The white-washed wooden main building and cabins are arranged around an inviting little beach beyond which a massive lake stretches into the distance, its taut surface broken by outcrops of fir tree islands. There are canoes on the decking and chipmunks in the undergrowth. \"This is more like it,\" I tell myself. </p> <p>Severn Lodge is typical of many of the small resorts that scatter this area, catering for those who haven't the funds or the time to build their own lakeside cabin. Family- and couple-friendly, Severn Lodge was originally the site of the Georgian Bay Lumber Company before passing into the hands of The Mordolphtons, a private club from Pittsburgh in the 1800s. It became a public resort in the early 1920s. The Lodge is now just a two-hour drive from Toronto, but for the Mordolphtons a weekend here meant a train ride, a steam boat and then an afternoon portaging over the rapids. Sepia photos of club members wearing full length swim suits and rugged smiles adorn the walls of the lodge and while they obviously stare out from a very different time, it is still possible to feel a connection with their hardier age of holidaying here. </p> <p>Waking early the next morning, I opened my cabin door to discover a thin veil of mist hanging just above the dark water. The fir tree islands appeared like outlandish ships adrift, or mountain peaks rising through clouds. There was almost complete silence with just the slow gulp and slap of water under the decking to accompany me as I slipped into the lake. Any worries I might have had about this trip dissolved immediately as I swam out into the mists and floated there on my back, watching a weak sun begin to burn its way through the morning clouds. </p> <p>This illusion of hardy Canadian holiday ing disappeared just as quickly as my worries, though, as a distant whine and a white fin of feathered water signal the arrival of the first water skier of the day. Because - be warned - the downside of having the lakes of Ontario within reach for a weekend is that they're in reach of everyone else, too. Yes, later in the day I get the Canadian canoe experience I'd dreamed of in the plane on the way over, but I do so having to accept that the signature tune of these waters is not the call of the moose or the mating cry of the loon, but rather the distant hum of outboard engines and the screams of adrenaline-hyped Sea-Doo riders. </p> <p>A (slightly) wilder time of it can be had in the Georgian Bay Islands national park. A short drive north to Honey Harbour brings you to the launch point into these 59 islands bought by the Canadian gov ernment in 1929 for \"national purposes\". In 1930, George Lynn, the first park warden, was appointed and charged with turning these remote, lonely islands into a public visiting place while preserving their natural state. It seems George was pretty successful. </p> <p> T The park now boasts the greatest diversity of reptiles and amphibians of any national park in Canada and judging from the stream of boats heading across the choppy waters, it's still pulling in the punters. The camping may be somewhat sanitised (tent shelters, stoves, sinks), but these islands do feel like a real piece of the Canadian wilderness - complete with black bear warning signs. Another sign informs me that the wardens are indeed, as I'd been warned, on strike - but that they've organised themselves so as not to disrupt the working of the park. It would seem this is a very Canadian strike. </p> <p>Walking through the tall forest of Beausoleil island over to Christian Beach on the west coast, I'm accompanied by the whirr of cicadas and a blustery warm wind, both of which feel to have arrived straight from the Mediterranean. I feel as if I'm in Greece or Croatia rather than Ontario. Emerging on to the sand and pebble beach at the end of the trail, however, the view is very much Canadian. White sailed boats and dinghies tack and rock on the ruffled bay against a backdrop of hardwood forest while above them a young osprey tries its wings, escorted by its more graceful parent. </p> <p>This is the type of terrain that first inspired Ontario's Group of Seven \"frontier artists\" in the early 1900s. Travelling through the wilds of Ontario in a converted freight car, the artists formed a new \"outdoor\" aesthetic, \"risking all for the glory of a great adventure\". The groups' favourite symbol, of a lone pine against a glowering sky, became not just a hallmark of their work, but of this entire region. A place where, as they wrote in 1922, \"nature was the measure of a man's stature\". When they visited these islands in Georgian Bay A Y Jackson described their appeal: \"About these harsh and barren islands there is an undeniable fascination, possibly inherent in the manifest struggle recorded in their line, perhaps in the sense of remoteness and stern resistance to the encroachment of man.\" </p> <p>That resistance may have been dented somewhat now, but sitting on the beach with the wind beating on my skin and a low sun striking off the waves, I still felt a sense of what Jackson refers to. And, I realised my long weekend feels just that - long, the hours like days and the days like weeks. To be honest though, as I drive back down into Toronto that evening and the lights of the city rise about me, it still hasn't felt like quite long enough. So, to answer my question at the start of this article: Yes, you can have a long weekend in the Ontario lakes, but if you're able, take a little longer and \"risk all for the glory of a great adventure\". After all with so many \"great days\" to be had, it's a shame to have to rush them. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> </p> <p>Frontier Canada (020-8776 8709, <a href=\"http://www.frontier-travel.co.uk\">frontier-travel.co.uk</a>) offers four nights' self-catering at the Severn Lodge in Ontario's Lakes Cottage Country from \u00a3853pp including Air Canada flights to Toronto and car hire. </p> <p><strong> Further information:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.travelcanada.ca\">travelcanada.ca</a>.

  "<p>For a while now, West Africa has been calling me. Like a drumbeat rising in tempo, it's been getting louder and louder. I am itching to go there. I lived in Kenya for a long time and I've always known that the other side of this great continent had a different vibe, a different beat. More raucous, more colourful, more maddening. It's Africa all right, but with the volume turned up. </p> <p>It's time I explored it a little and I don't mean the beach resorts of the Gambia. West Africa might contain some of the poorest countries on the planet, but it pulsates with an energy and vitality that I just have to experience. I want to feel the rhythm of Dakar and the madness of Lagos, and I want to journey down the great River Niger and see what all the fuss is about over Timbuktu.</p> <p>My journey will take in about a dozen countries, red-tape and security concerns permitting. In Senegal, I'll check out Dakar's reputation as the clubbing capital of Africa and perhaps catch Youssou N'Dour if he's in town. Heading south, I plan on wandering around the Fouta Djalon highlands, doing some trekking.</p> <p>From one of the least visited countries, my route takes me east to Mali - probably the most visited country in the region. Travelling on the Niger should be a highlight of the trip, taking in the slow pace of river life with stops in ancient towns like Djenne with its famous mud mosque. Following the river downstream and some rough travelling later, I'll arrive in Niamey, in Niger. Keeping my ear to the ground, I'll try to head north to Agadez, an ancient trading town on the edge of the Sahara.</p> <p> By the time I get to Burkina Faso, I think I'll be quite relieved. One of the more laid-back countries, I have a feeling I might end up spending more time here than I'd anticipated ... But C\u00f4te d'Ivoire beckons and I'll be sure to stop and stare at the incredible basilica in the capital. After checking out Abidjan, I head into Ghana - fantastic beaches, Ashanti culture and Accra will easily take up a few weeks.</p> <p>I don't know quite what to expect in Togo and Benin, but I'll be travelling through them to get to Nigeria, the one country on this trip I'm wary about. My challenge is to survive it in one piece! I'll finally end my trip in Cameroon, the most diverse country in West Africa from a cultural and scenic perspective.</p> <p>I'm not kidding myself that this is going to be an easy trip, but send me there and I hope I can show you just what a fantastic part of the world this is.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Bill Driscoll is planning a six-month trip to India. Should he take a water filter or buy bottled water?</strong> </p> <p>Take a water purifier. We use a fairly expensive one, but each cartridge filters up to 100 gallons, and produces microbiologically pure water suitable for drinking and cleaning teeth. There is a distressing amount of plastic waste lying around and buying plastic bottles adds to this problem. <strong> James &amp; Halcyon Leonard</strong> </p> <p>It is a lot easier to buy bottled - it is cheap and easily available, given the amount you will drink in the heat, and, most important, it is likely to be cold. If you are doing some serious trekking up in the mountains, it may be helpful to have a water filter (streams are seldom as pure as they look), but for general travelling around India there is always a shop. Make sure, however, that the seal is intact on the bottle (ask the shopkeeper/ waiter to bring it out unopened). On glass-bottled carbonated water, check that the sealed bottle cap matches the brand on the bottle label - unbranded gold caps are evidence of 'soda stream' style fill ups, potentially from the tap. Check out lime sodas without sugar - fizzy water with fresh lime juice, far more refreshing than filtered water. <br><strong> Toby Egelnick</strong> </p> <p><strong> Peter Jollands wants to go to the Do\u00f1ana national park in Spain in November.</strong> </p> <p>We can recommend the four-star Parador de Mazagon (0034 959 536300, <a href=\"http://www.parador.es\">parador.es</a>), located in the Park, near the beach and a great base for exploring.

  "<p>It's amazing how many bad things start with the letter D. Death, doom, damnation, despair, destruction, disaster, Davros, Des'ree, Da Republican Party ... and now <strong> Dirty War</strong> (Sun, 9pm, BBC1), the spiritual heir to classic BBC scarefests like The War Game and Threads - two shows that could convince almost anyone to commit suicide by the time the end credits stopped rolling. </p> <p>So how does it measure up? Could it give you nightmares? Does it leave you reeling with queasy, futile horror? Will it stink out your living room with a sense of looming cataclysm so overpowering you'll want to cry all the water out of your body and swim away to deadland? </p> <p>Not really. </p> <p>Simply put, the prospect of a dirty bomb going pop isn't quite as horrifying as the complete and utter destruction of the world, something The War Game and Threads had on their side. In fact, the body count is surprisingly low. </p> <p>Having said that, the programme as a whole feels uncomfortably authentic, and should leave you feeling, oooh, 70% less secure than you do right now. Depressingly, it also leaves you certain that a dirty bomb will DEFINITELY, ABSOLUTELY and UNEQUIVOCALLY go off at some point in the near future. That's a given. Threads urged the audience to reconsider the madness of nuclear proliferation; Dirty War simply asks the authorities to provide sufficient damage limitation. </p> <p>And it's gripping. There's a fair amount of clunky dialogue in which officials quote statistics at one another, but the overall sense of clammy hysteria is both undeniable and frightening. </p> <p>Still, it's not all bad news. For one thing, the need for immediate decontamination means that if a dirty bomb goes off near your office, you'll get to see all your workmates stripping off and showering, like, totally naked. Honestly, you'd see it all. I can't stress this highly enough - you will DEFINITELY, ABSOLUTELY and UNEQUIVOCALLY see your boss's bum. </p> <p>Secondly, since a dirty bomb would leave a large section of the capital uninhabitable for decades, house prices would tumble - thereby allowing me to finally gain a foothold on the property ladder. Christ, I could probably buy Clarence House for 25p. So there you go. Always a silver lining. </p> <p>There's more death on offer in <strong> Mediums: Talking To The Dead </strong> (Wed, 9pm, BBC2), a remarkable three-parter following some of the nation's leading corpse whisperers as they ply their trade. </p> <p>From where I'm sitting, the vast majority of them are despicable liars - ghastly, barefaced, ruthless, coin-eyed, opportunist, exploitative, nauseating lickpennies prepared to milk the grieving and bewildered for everything they've got, and I'd sincerely like to glue them face-first to a dining table and kick their arses purple with a pair of concrete boots. </p> <p>That's how I usually feel about mediums. Yet even I was flummoxed into silence by Gordon Smith, \"Britain's most accurate medium\", who's either the most amazing trickster I've ever seen, or genuinely psychic, or genuinely conversing with the dead. </p> <p>Not only is he the most humble medium involved in the show, he's the only one who doesn't seem to rely solely on guesswork and fibbing. Smith's communications are spot on, first time, every time - right down to the full Christian and surnames of the deceased. </p> <p>Every fibre of my being tells me it must be a trick, but I'm damned if I can see how it works. Mind you, I used to think that about Derren Brown, until his latest series seemed packed with stooges and he rather lost his mystic sheen. </p> <p>Speaking of Derren Brown, I recently noticed the publicity for his live shows contained a quote from this very column - \"Clearly the greatest dinner party guest in history ... or the scariest man in Britain\". </p> <p>The full sentence originally read: \"Clearly the greatest dinner party guest in history - he's either a balls-out con artist or the scariest man in Britain.\" </p> <p>He must've erased the con artist bit with some super-magic \"mind control\", eh? Now that's magic.</p>",
  "<p>Popping into a petrol station to withdraw some money at its cash machine? Look out for the creeping introduction of \u00a31.50 fees to gain access to your own money. </p> <p>Five years ago, virtually all cashpoints in the UK were free and the vast majority of machines operated by mainstream bank and building societies remain so. But a proliferation of new fee-charging \"convenience\" cash machines, set up mainly by independent operators, means that customers are nowadays charged at more than one in three machines. </p> <p>Nationwide building society says that in the first six months of this year, the number of fee-charging machines went up by 40% from around 13,000 to around 18,500. They now cost consumers more than \u00a360m each year and this will escalate, it believes. </p> <p>\"We think the number of fee-charging machines could overtake the number of free machines by the end of next year or the beginning of 2006,\" a spokesperson said. Not only are the majority of the new ATMs installed fee-charging (64% in 2003), but also some financial institutions are selling off free machines to companies who charge. </p> <p>HBOS (parent group of Halifax) has agreed to sell 816 of its non-branch machines, most of which are in petrol stations, to major charging machine operator Cardpoint. Last year, Abbey sold 50 machines located in Shell garages to Moneybox, another major player. </p> <p>While both HBOS and Abbey say they are committed to keeping their remaining ATMs networks free - each has a further 2,700 machines - the concern is that other banks may follow suit and sell off ATMs in remote locations, where low usage makes them expensive to operate as a free service. </p> <p>Another worrying new trend, says Nationwide, is the aggressive approach of the operators seeking to expand their networks by poaching sites where banks or building societies operate free machines. Typically they offer the owner - a corner shop, pub, garage or hospital - financial inducements to replace free cashpoints with ones that charge. </p> <p>The Royal Bank of Scotland also took an interesting step recently in buying the largest operator of fee-charging cash machines, Hanco. </p> <p>An RBS spokeswoman says: \"These machines, which are primarily owned by the retailer, are meeting a demand driven by the owners of convenience stores, retailers, pubs and clubs and their customers for access to cash in those areas where the level of demand does not justify the considerable investment required in a traditional cash machine.\" </p> <p>She insisted the acquisition is totally separate to the cashpoint networks of the group's retail banks (RBS, NatWest, Ulster Bank and Tesco Personal Finance). \"We have no plans to change our policy of providing free to use cash machines... for our customers and those of other banks.\" </p> <p>Stuart Bernau, Nationwide executive director, says: \"Nationwide is concerned that the UK's network of free cash machines is under threat. This is a serious issue for consumers particularly as machines that were free are being replaced with ones that charge, so it is very easy for people to be caught out and face an unexpected fee.\" </p> <p>ATM operators agreed that from April this year, all machines that charge a fee would carry a clear warning in the form of a sticker or on-screen message. But not all of them are playing fair. </p> <p>Some, for example, put warning signs at knee height. Others use stickers which are the same bright colour as the machine, making them hard to spot. In a Nationwide survey, one in four people who had used a charging machine since April said they didn't see any warning before requesting their cash and 97% thought the visibility of warnings should be improved. </p> <p>There is also concern that fee-charging machines tend to target people who can least afford to pay - the young being particularly vulnerable. </p> <p>The survey found that more than a quarter of those withdrawing cash from a charging machine took out \u00a320 or less which, with a typical charge of \u00a31.50, means the fee was at least 7.5% of the sum withdrawn. </p> <p>Nationwide is pushing for a tougher code of practice on this front among members of Link, the UK's cashpoint network, for operators of fee-charging machines. </p> <p>It's true that, in certain circumstances, any cash machine can be a godsend. Stuck in an out-of-town nightclub late at night, for example, you may welcome the chance to pay \u00a31.50 in order to withdraw your cab fare from an ATM in the foyer. </p> <p>But the worry is that people will use fee-charging machines either because they don't realise they'll be charged or because they don't know there's a free alternative nearby. </p> <p><strong>How to avoid the charges</strong></p> <p>To avoid being caught out by unexpected fees, Nationwide offers the following tips: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Try to use a cash machine that you know doesn't charge </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Check the machine for warning stickers or an on-screen warning message. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you see signs saying \"free balance inquiries\", beware: you are likely to be charged for withdrawals.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If the machine is going to charge and you don't want to pay, there is likely to be a free cash machine nearby if you're in a town centre.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If there is no free cash machine available use your debit card for purchases. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To find out if your nearest ATM charges, visit <a href=\"http://www.link.co.uk/atm/fr_atm_locator.html\">www.link.co.uk/atm/fr_atm_locator.html</a>. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If a machine tries to charge you, without carrying an up-front warning, report it to Link on 01423 356000 or by email to <a href=\"mailto:linkinfo@link.co.uk\">linkinfo@link.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>A decade after the infamous Hoover \"free flights\" fiasco, thousands of consumers are wondering if they may have signed up to a similar deal. BT customers tempted by the company's broadband plan following an offer of free flights to the US have told Jobs &amp; Money they are so fed up with chasing them they wish they hadn't bothered. </p> <p>It is believed that as many as half of the 10,000 people who have applied for free flights under the BT promotion are still waiting for their travel offers to arrive. </p> <p>Harry Cichy, who came to prominence after organising a class action lawsuit on behalf of those left without Hoover flights, says he has received hundreds of emails from frustrated BT consumers wanting to know if they are the only ones who are having difficulty in obtaining their flights. \"At one point I was receiving at least 50 emails a day and it did bring back a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It's almost as though the big companies have learned nothing from the whole Hoover affair - they keep coming up with these offers, and seem surprised when people get upset when the flights aren't forthcoming,\" he says. </p> <p>BT strenuously denies there is a problem and insists everyone who has applied will receive their flights. But Rise Travel, the company behind the promotion, admits that that there have been delays - which it blames on the Post Office. </p> <p>The BT deal was first advertised in May, and offered new subscribers to its broadband service a free flight on certain routes to America's east coast, or to one of several European destinations. Customers had to agree to take the \u00a319.99 a month broadband service for a minimum of 12 months to receive a flight worth around \u00a3200. </p> <p>Despite the fact that they had to agree to pay the airport taxes and the extra costs of flying from some regional airports, it was certainly an attractive offer. Of the people who took out a subscription, around 10,000 went ahead and applied for their free return flight. </p> <p>However, the promotion, handled by Rise Travel on BT's behalf, has been plagued by problems, according to those customers who have contacted Jobs &amp; Money and Mr Cichy. </p> <p>Those signing up for the offer are required to name three different destinations and a host of dates when they are happy to fly. </p> <p>Some BT customers have been sent vouchers after their applications have been processed, but others haven't received anything at all from either firm, and all their requests for infor mation as to how their application was proceeding have, they say, been ignored. </p> <p>Janet Copp and her husband Michael Stanway, who live in north London with Janet's son, contacted Jobs &amp; Money after becoming frustrated with the lack of response from BT and Rise Travel. </p> <p>They signed up to BT's broadband at the start of the summer and say they were heavily influenced in their choice of provider by the free flight offer from BT. </p> <p>\"My son has a girlfriend in America, so it was one offer that made a lot of sense for us. However, all our attempts to get our flight have, so far, failed. Emails have batted back and forward to no avail. </p> <p>\"At the start they just fobbed off our requests, then they keep asking us to send in the voucher with our chosen dates. When we explain that we haven't received the voucher, the whole thing falls apart,\" says Janet. </p> <p>Andrew Bryant, an IT consultant from Leeds, tells a similar story. He signed up to BT's broadband offer in June and was lucky enough to receive his voucher. He filled it in quickly and returned it, only to hear nothing more. </p> <p>\"The paperwork says you will be given a booking within 28 days. I waited around six weeks and then started trying to contact Rise Travel. Every time I rang them I would hold on for five minutes only to be put over to an answerphone.\" </p> <p>Next he tried contacting BT and it was the same story. When someone finally rang him back last week, they confirmed the flight details and said they would call back to confirm the booking within 24 hours - a deadline that came and went without a call. </p> <p>\"The free flight offer was the only reason I took out the subscription with BT. There are cheaper broadband providers out there; I'm starting to wish I hadn't bothered,\" he says. </p> <p>Both BT and Rise Travel have defended the offer as being very successful and say that everyone who has applied for a flight will receive one. </p> <p>John Cookson of Rise Travel says: \"It's true that we have had problems with the post in this area that has severely hampered our attempts to get vouchers out to those who signed up to the offer. The post was so bad that we took the matter up with Adam Crozier's (Royal Mail's chief executive) office. </p> <p>\"The delays were then exacerbated by the fact that we had to go back to BT and confirm that those whose vouchers had gone missing were eligible. There have been a few administrative delays but everyone will get their flights - and we will be extending the March deadline by which people have to have taken the flights if required.\" </p> <p>He says half the 10,000 applicants have been offered bookings on actual flights, although he declined to say how many people had actually flown, citing client confidentiality. He promises that the remaining 5,000 will be processed over the coming weeks. </p> <p>When we spoke to BT, its spokesman also declined to say how many people had flown using the offer. A BT spokesman told Jobs &amp; Money that 90% of applicants had been \"booked on flights\", somewhat contradicting Rise's claim that just half of applicants had so far been offered a flight. </p> <p>\"This is not going to be a Hoover and it's ridiculous to suggest it will become one - everyone who is entitled to a free flight will get one,\" said the spokesman. </p> <p><strong>Prepare for turbulence</strong></p> <p>Free flight promotion schemes are designed to attract the maximum publicity for the smallest possible cost. </p> <p>Typically they work by offering off-peak flights at inconvenient times that are being sold off cheaply by the airlines. The wording of the offers is such that you have very little say on when and where you get to fly. </p> <p>Those taking up the recent BT offer who want to visit the US had to name three airports which could be as much as 500 miles apart. They also have to be extremely flexible on dates - and the promotion companies effectively rely on most applicants being put off by such restrictions. </p> <p>The companies try to make up their income by selling add-ons such as travel insurance or extra flights to allow a partner or friend to accompany the person taking the free flight. </p> <p>But the promotions can go wrong when there is a considerably higher take up than anticipated. </p> <p>Californian wine company E&amp;J Gallo recently offered a free transatlantic flight just for buying a half case (six bottles) of wine, costing \u00a340, and in some supermarkets as low as \u00a324.99. </p> <p>Behind the offer is organiser Rise Travel, which also managed the BT Broadband offer. And like the BT offer, it has also kept Harry Cichy's inbox full with angry correspondents wanting to know what is happening. </p> <p>Sainsbury's, one of the retailers involved in the promotion, said it has had customers complain - largely over delays and lack of response - but said the complaints have been resolved now. </p> <p>E&amp;J Gallo's marketing manager Ian Belcher told J&amp;M that he recently called Rise Travel staff into his office to give them (in his words) a \"kick up the backside\" to speed up the distribution of flights to the 8,000 wine case buyers that had applied for flights. </p> <p>\"There have been a few delays but I can confirm that everyone who is entitled to a flight will receive one,\" he said. </p> <p>These offers are certainly back in vogue. The motorway catering firm Little Chef is currently offering a free weekend away in Europe or the US -including hotel accommodation - to anyone who eats five meals during September and November.

  "The Law Society is to split into two bodies, one to police solicitors' conduct and the other to act as their trade union, in the biggest change in its 179-year history. <p>The move comes in the face of growing criticism that the two functions are incompatible, and ahead of an inquiry by Sir David Clementi, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, which is expected to propose big reforms in the way legal services are regulated. </p> <p>The 105-strong governing council of the society, which represents and regulates the 92,000 solicitors in England and Wales, took the decision in closed session in Bristol this week. </p> <p>By an 82% majority it backed a plan to break apart its regulatory activities - investigating complaints and disciplining its members - from its representative and trade union functions. </p> <p>The society's president, Edward Nally, said: \"I believe we have demonstrated the society is willing to make the necessary changes to modernise its governance arrangements to become a more consumer-focused regulator.\" </p> <p>The reform would need an act of parliament to be fully implemented and would be up and running in 2007 at the earliest, he said. </p> <p>Since the 90s the society has faced government threats to remove its powers of self-regulation as it repeatedly failed to meet government targets for the resolution of complaints. </p> <p>Last February the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, appointed a legal services complaints commissioner to oversee complaints handling, and this month gave her powers to fine the society up to \u00a31m if its performance failed to improve.</p>",
  "<p>A crowded marketplace can be the loneliest of spots. The camaraderie of the traders, familiarities exchanged with regular customers, even the sight of the local traffic warden eyeing the illegally parked white vans: if the wrong mood is upon you, all of these can weigh down your heart. The same is true of the financial markets - just ask the average hedge fund manager. </p> <p>Stroll down London's Curzon Street and you will find doorway after doorway festooned with the discreet brass plates that identify the homes of Britain's hedge fund industry. These are the investors who chase absolute returns, rather than benchmarking themselves against an index such as the FTSE 100, in the fashion of a traditional insurance or pension fund manager. Crucially, they can go long or short of just about any asset they choose, as opposed to the \"long only\" manager who typically apportions money rigidly across the equity and bond markets. </p> <p>Walk through the door and you will probably find three or four men, no longer quite so young and no longer City-suited, amid a scattering of flatscreen monitors and working to the soundtrack of rolling financial news from CNBC. </p> <p>It is unlikely that you could discern at first glance whether they have a bare few million or many hundreds of millions of dollars under their control. An extra research assistant and secretary, a slightly more palatial meeting room: these might just provide a clue. However, this is an industry with enormous operational gearing. The same very small team can, with a following wind, grow the funds under its charge exponentially before it hits capacity constraints. </p> <p>In this industry you can start small but dream big and make the transition in very short order. The physical barriers to entry are low - all you need is a bit of kit, some space and a regulatory approval that should only take a few months to secure. The first real hurdle is finding investors willing to entrust their funds to your high-octane investment process. The next is delivering a return sufficient to attract more money to manage. </p> <p>In many ways attracting the second wave of money is more difficult. The original backers often get a slice of the equity in return for their seed money. Once the wagon is rolling, however, good performance (both in terms of absolute returns and their volatility) is really all that matters. But in pretty perfect markets, the majority of managers are likely to fall short of their marketing promises. This is when the loneliness can set in. </p> <p>Most hedge fund managers hail from the vast trading and investment floors of the City. Striking out with a couple of mates - even with the operational and financial help of a big bank - is an entrepreneurial move that is an alien experience for most. Past bonuses might provide economic insulation from the cashflow risks of a business start-up, but the emotional risks are less easy to hedge. </p> <p>On a crowded trading floor the slings and arrows of the market's outrageous fortune hit the armour of a corporate army: they may wound, but the pain is shared. The sharing experience is not always happy - just listen to a profitable trader moaning that his success has subsidised others' failures - and, of course, the bank's owners always want their slice. </p> <p>A new hedge fund manager in his short-lease office is as much part of the market as he might have been in the heart of an investment bank's dealing room. Today's financial markets are virtual places - if you have a screen, you are in the flow. But it is difficult to find the necessary tea and sympathy, or gallows humour, in a row of prices on a Reuters terminal. </p> <p>The majority of hedge funds do not develop beyond infancy. A mixture of poor investment performance, weak marketing, insufficient funding and emotional damage brings their lives to an early close. Their investors do not necessarily suffer great loss, merely thin returns which prompt them to look for something better a few doors down Curzon Street. </p> <p>Now the short lifecycle of the failed hedge fund may be becoming even more fleeting. In recent months poor performance has pushed the industry towards crisis. Most funds thrive on the volatility of asset prices or big investment trends, or both. For the past six months neither of these conditions has been in place. And six months is a long time in this sector. </p> <p>Overall hedge fund returns are now negative for 2004 as a whole. If this persists, investors may abandon them for something else entirely. For now, they are likely to churn their investments in search of the few real winning managers. Those Curzon Street leases are short for a very good reason. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group </p> <p><a href=\"\" \"mailto:edmond.warner@theguardian.com\">edmond.warner@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>With six movies awaiting release in the US this autumn, Jude Law seems determined to make himself over. Right now, despite an Oscar nomination for The Talented Mister Ripley, eye-catching parts in movies by Spielberg and Sam Mendes (a British director who's yet to make a British movie), and the starring role in Cold Mountain, Law still registers with American audiences as an actor rather than a star. These six movies seem like part of a plan to make his name resonate in the US the way it already does for British moviegoers.</p> <p>British men have an odd time of it in Hollywood. Set beside a reassuringly heterosexual roughneck like Russell Crowe, a Jude Law can easily come across as effete, and it's a minor fact of life that many tin-eared Americans think most British men sound gay (even as they \"just lurve\" our accents). Law, with his annoyingly perfect physical and facial beauty, is ripe for this misperception. His manner of speaking doesn't help him either, and too often his interviews make him sound like a bimbo, so we shall see if the current six-movie blitz achieves its aim and makes Law a one-name star in the land of the free and the brave.</p> <p>I hope it happens for him, because leaving aside the good looks and banal utterances, Law is one prodigiously talented actor. The sheer speed of his ascent to stardom is evidence of something out of the ordinary. In 1994 he had a false start with Shopping, but 1997 changed everything, giving him the toothsome role of Bosie in Wilde, a wilful little monster who remained humanly sympathetic thanks to Law.</p> <p>Then Anthony Minghella signed him up to play Dickie Greenleaf, rich, suave object of envy and desire to Matt Damon's Ripley. With an effortless American accent and an almost balletic grace, Law almost stole the movie out from under Damon, and the casting agents all took note. Two odd but compelling physical performances followed: as a Weegee-like psychotic photographer-assassin in the otherwise dreary Road To Perdition; and as Gigolo Joe in AI, a robot-seducer with a clanky, mechanical elegance. Thereafter Cold Mountain set him up as a leading man, and the six movies in the pipeline, particularly Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow (pictured), which he produced himself, should do the rest.</p> <p><strong>Career high</strong> Ripley, and his work for Mendes and Spielberg. His highs are all ahead of him, one suspects.</p> <p><strong>Career low</strong> Love, Honour And Obey.

  "<p>First the good news. Opera North's new production of Manon Lescaut is Richard Farnes's first as the company's music director, and it is a thoroughly auspicious beginning. He has total control of all that happens in the pit - the Opera North orchestra plays superbly for him - and every detail of Puccini's lustrous score is at his fingertips, with each throb and flicker of its dramatic pulse vividly conveyed. If other elements in the production are less than convincing, at least the quality of Farnes's contribution is never in doubt. </p> <p>Certainly, some of the singing makes good use of the secure orchestral foundation he provides, notably Brian Bannatyne Scott's all-too-plausible Geronte and Christopher Purves's weak-willed Lescaut. The two central roles are often vocally striking, too: the beefy, Italianate sound of Hugh Smith's Des Grieux is set against the edgier (and, in the lower register, uncomfortably thin) tone of Natalia Dercho's Manon, and they combine powerfully. But neither of the singers is remotely convincing visually. Smith lacks youthful vitality, and Dercho's Manon is short on charm, making her character even more unsympathetic than usual. </p> <p>But then, not much is convincing about Daniel Slater's staging. Robert Innes Hopkins' designs relocate the story to France immediately after the liberation in 1945. That is fine as far as it goes, but the protagonists have also been made into characters in a movie directed by the usually peripheral Edmondo (Gordon Wilson). The trappings of a 1940s film set - lights, camera, clapperboard - dominate the first act, but are subsequently more or less discarded until the end of the final scene, when the lovers die in the desert (a railway track in this version), only to get up and walk off the set as the \"director\" reappears with his clipboard. </p> <p>It is contrived and baffling, and adds absolutely nothing to any understanding of the story. The Lulu-style film sequence projected during the orchestral intermezzo before the third act, showing Manon having her head shaved in prison and being branded with a swastika (presumably because she is thought to be a Nazi collaborator), adds yet another gloss, and seems to hint at another production altogether. It's just a mess, really - though the glorious music survives. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In rep until November 5. Box office: 0113-222 6222. Then touring.</p>",

  "In June of this year, at the height of media speculation that Tony Blair was thinking of resigning, the now famous \"wobble\", a short piece appeared in the Spectator written by its political editor, Peter Oborne. It recounted, comically and briefly, a conversation between Boris Johnson, the magazine's editor, and Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff, conducted on their bicycles, at a traffic light. Powell, referring to Gordon Brown's political career, described it as \"a Shakespearean tragedy\". \"He's like the guy who thinks he is going to be king but never gets it.\" Quite which tragedy Powell had in mind is unclear, because the lights then changed. Macbeth, perhaps, but as someone has observed, \"only if Brown is Duncan\". Lear and Othello are clearly out. The most likely candidate seems to be Hamlet. Hamlet, the prototype of inaction, the man who thinks \"too precisely on the event\", and who, when he does act, unleashes a bloodbath. But even this won't do. Hamlet is a man who becomes progressively disillusioned with humanity - it is this that finally switches him from inertia to action. Brown, though there have been events in his life that could have led him to despair, remains an optimist. \"I do believe that tomorrow can be better than today.\" <p>Still, there is a paradox to Brown. No one questions his political skill. The longest-serving chancellor in modern history, he has succeeded in giving Labour an economic discipline and purpose inconceivable only 20 years ago. A high level of employment. A National Health Service budget that will have doubled by 2007, the longest programme of sustained growth in its history. He is regularly described as \"brilliant\", \"sophisticated\", \"not flaky\", \"operationally effective\". And yet the moment comments turn to his private persona, doubts start to creep in. He is \"dour\", \"workaholic\", \"opaque\", once described by historian Peter Hennessy as \"having the social skills of a whelk\". He is also perceived as a man who has, inexplicably, missed his moment - and not once but several times. Failing to challenge John Smith for the leadership in 1992. Not challenging Blair in 1994. Not capitalising on the wobble in the summer. And, again, with the recent reshuffle, being shunted aside as chief election strategist by Blair's appointment of Alan Milburn back to the cabinet. As if the very skills that make him such a formidable politician somehow elude him when it comes to his personal ambition. </p> <p>The question then is, is this pusillanimity on his part? Hamlet's \"vicious mole of nature\"? Does he lack the killer instinct? The instinct that enabled Blair to seize his chance in 1994, acting swiftly after John Smith's death to mobilise support, while Brown was still mourning his old friend. But Brown can be ruthless. In the July 1998 reshuffle, in a dispute over welfare reform, Brown blocked Frank Field's promotion to social security secretary. \"He got rid of him,\" I was told. \"That decision wasn't Blair it was Brown\" - albeit in a dispute over policy rather than personality. Brown was ruthless with Blair, too, over the euro, effectively outmanoeuvring him with the \"five economic tests\" and making Britain's decision to join the euro a Treasury decision. And, most recently, in announcing the redundancies of 84,500 civil service posts in the spending review. \"Prudent with a purpose\" is virtually Brown's motto. \"Ruthless with a purpose\" might be another. Though he would dislike the word \"ruthless\", preferring \"decisive\". \"Look, you have to get on with it.\" In his own mind politics, ambition and duty are identical - so for him there is no paradox. \"I think when I stood aside [in 1994] I did what I thought was right for the Labour party and for the long-term interests of the country. And out of a sense of duty.\" This is his declaration of intent. \"That's why it is quite difficult when people say I am driven only by personal ambition ... People will have to make up their own minds ... But they can't run two stories at once.\" That he is simultanously weak and powerful. </p> <p>In a sense, the running of two stories - Tony Blair on the one hand, Gordon Brown on the other - is the theme of this government. And you have to ask to whose advantage this has been. It has been the Tony and Gordon show, one pitted against the other, in some sort of sprawling soap-operatic chronicle, starting with suggestions as early as 1996 that Brown was not \"a family man\", something that led Sue Lawley to ask him about his sexuality on Desert Island Discs, followed by the unattributed jibe in 1998 that Brown has \"psychological flaws\". Both sides have been complicit in briefing against the other but there is no doubt that, particularly in the days when Blair was riding high, Brown was the loser. He lacks the gift, and perhaps the inclination, to make himself shine in the bright light of publicity. The more Labour became dominated by the energies of its advertising industry, spin, the more Brown's pedantic carefulness looked - well, boring. He will always look wooden, inexpressive, next to the mobility of a Blair or a Milburn. But now, post-Hutton, there is a growing distaste for spin that has even been felt in government - Estelle Morris, arts minister, announcing her intention to resign for the second time a couple of weeks ago, cited \"personalised politics\" as one of her reasons for going; Andrew Smith, departing pensions minister, similarly complained about briefings against him. </p> <p>I asked Brown if he felt that the perceived division between the chancellor and the prime minister had contributed to a lack of trust in the government. It was the only time in our conversation that he faltered. \"What did you say?\" And he asked me to repeat it. But by this time he was back on track. \"People will have to judge us by what we achieve - whether there is a consistency in what we promise and what we deliver.\" </p> <p>Brown is an impressive physical presence - more broad than tall - a reminder of the athlete he once was. A black mop of shiny hair frames a face with a permanently furrowed brow, and yet there is something languorous about him. He doesn't so much sit in a chair as fall into it. People say, and it's true, that he doesn't smile much, but he has a throaty chuckle and the disconcerting habit of laughing when he is cross. He is at his relaxed best in his home in his East Dunfermline constituency in Fife - a detached, double-fronted Victorian house with a large sloping garden behind. Here he spends most weekends, with Sarah, his wife of four years, and their son John, almost one year old. </p> <p>In the top corner of their garden is the small summer house that they have recently had built - just enough room for a table and two chairs - where, with his mobile phone, Brown works. \"The only place I can sit and not hear the house phones ringing.\" From here, he has a reassuring domestic view down past John's paddling pool and tortoise-shaped sandpit (\"Amazing what you can buy now\") to the kitchen that he and Sarah have recently modernised (\"We took out two walls, changed the structure a bit, and it's incredible how much light is let in\"). But for the most part the house looks untouched since he bought it almost 20 years ago. It is comfortable without being ostentatious and with no concession to \"designer living\". There are mementos from different parts of his life - a framed autographed football shirt, many photographs, his mother's piano. But otherwise there's a complete indifference to material things. In fact sometimes he doesn't seem to notice objects at all. I couldn't help remarking that he never remembered to close the fridge door. </p> <p>It used to be books, people say, that littered his floor but now it's kids toys, and little John runs the show. Brown says that he thinks he'll walk without bothering to crawl (\"No interest in crawling\") and worries that John has to travel so much to and from London, \"more than is probably good for a young baby. But we like to get him up here as often as we can for the air.\" In Sarah's company he visibly lightens. She jokes and gossips about some of his parliamentary colleagues, and though he doesn't join in, he does chuckle. He was 49 when he married and at one point I asked him, why Sarah? He admired her, he said. \"We have been through a lot together.\" And, he says, she has courage. \"Not the absence of fear, because we are all afraid. Courage is the belief that there is something more important than safety.\" Of all the things he said, the encomiums on decency, social justice, duty - this was the most radical. He is not talking about recklessness. This is Gordon Brown - he is cautious, he is prudent, he is careful, he is used to waiting. He waited a long time to get married. He is talking about safety as the enemy of progress - be it personal, be it political. </p> <p>There is a criticism of Brown that he has taken pains to command respect but none at all to inspire affection. It may be true. Affection, in his public life, is simply not his style. I think he would regard it as a kind of emotional cheating or play-acting - consciously to intrude the personality into the work. </p> <p>He is a man who speaks reluctantly, at least in public, of disappointment and griefs. In January 2002, his 10-day-old daughter Jennifer died after being born two months prematurely. At her funeral he declared that Jennifer had transformed his and Sarah's lives twice. \"Once by entering our lives, then by leaving.\" He tells me, \"It was a year after her death before I could listen to a piece of music.\" Occasionally he brings her up in conversation, or points to a photo of her. He cries when he speaks of her. \"When she was born everything seemed fine, even though she was premature. But after six days she had a brain haemorrhage. All we could do was sit and hold her hand basically.\" As he was saying this, his son John appeared and he broke off. \"We're fine now. John's very strong so we're very happy. You can see we're a happy home here, I think.\" In June of this year the couple launched the Jennifer Brown Fund to raise money to finance research into premature births. \"We were surprised when we received thousands of letters to realise how often this happens. We felt we had a duty to help others potentially in the same position.\" At the launch party in the garden of his home Brown was rocking his son in his arms and couldn't stop kissing him. </p> <p>It was a few days later that I was talking to him on the phone. He was explaining something about the International Finance Facility (IFF), a proposal to double current aid to the poorest countries, \"from $50 billion annually to $100 billion annually\". Development and aid is the subject on which Brown is most eloquent and passionate, though he says, \"I know it's a dry issue - not a lot of votes there.\" I know something about this, too, because I was there when he gave a speech in the Vatican in July to the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace on Poverty and Globalisation outlining the ideas for the IFF. In attendance were many cardinals, plus finance ministers and financial advisors from around the world. At the press conference that followed every question was addressed to Brown - even he seemed embarrassed. </p> <p>Anyway, Brown in full flow is pretty unstoppable, so I was surprised when he broke off our phone conversation. \"You'll never guess what's just happened. You remember John's paddling pool? Well, it's just blown away down the hill.\" I offered to hang up. \"No, no,\" he said. \"It's OK. I can talk as I run.\" So off he went, running across the hills of Fife to retrieve his son's paddling pool, all the while talking about international development policy. As he has said of more momentous occasions, \"Sometimes events arise and you have to respond ... \" Politics is action, politics is thought - long-term strategy. And you have to be able to do both at once. </p> <p>Some years ago, when Brown was shadow chancellor, he told me this. \"All power corrupts and no power corrupts absolutely.\" At the time I thought it was a clever inversion of an old adage, referring to Labour's 18 years in opposition. Looked at again, the last part of that quote is as close as you can come to an exposition of what drives Brown's political philosophy. Politics, he is saying, concerns everyone - too serious to be left only to politicians. \"People have got to feel that they can play a part in changing things.\" The quote might be seen to have a resonance for his own situation as leader in waiting, too. Clearly a chancellor has a great deal of power, but not quite the power of a prime minister. It would be surprising if there weren't some bitterness, but it would be demeaning to admit to it openly. \"When people talk about party politics it is almost purely in the sense of ambitions - who's up, who's down, who's in, who's out. But it would be outrageous if that's what drove people on. The only point of being around is to get something done - not to talk about it in the House of Commons.\" </p> <p>For some people, he says, politics is the art of the possible. \"For me it is the art of making the desirable possible. If I didn't think I could achieve any more ... if, domestically, the agenda we started off on could not be completed, it would be time to do something else other than politics.\" And, out of nowhere, he says, \"Leadership ... You can be in office and achieve very little.\" </p> <p>At one point in our interview he began a sentence, \"If I were to start again ...\", which I could not persuade him to finish. But the admiration with which he went on to praise \"charities, non-governmental organisations, pressure groups. The energy there is phenomenal and could be so much greater ... Party politics could learn a lot from that,\" makes you wonder if what he was going to say was, if he could start again he'd do something more direct, closer to the grassroots. </p> <p>Everyone who knows Brown concurs in one thing - that his formative influence was his background, and in particular his late father John, a devoutly religious man and a minister in the Church of Scotland. When Brown talks of his father it is in almost poetic tones. \"He towered before me like a mountain, not in any way forbidding but in the sense of his strength. He went through his life liked by everybody: I don't think he made one single enemy. That's a long way from politics, I can tell you.\" Brown was born in 1951 in Glasgow, the middle of three sons, and was three when his father went to the parish of Kirkcaldy. The town was then entering a period of industrial decline - Brown recalls people coming to the door begging when the linoleum factory closed down. \"My father saw it as his duty to help.\" </p> <p>Murray Elder, the former chief of staff to John Smith, and Brown's oldest friend from nursery school days, remembers Mr Brown as \"a very impressive figure, intellectually strong. Everyone knew that if he'd wanted to he could have become professor of divinity at St Andrews, but academia was too dry for him. All that really interested him was being a pastor with a parish.\" The picture given of their father by Brown's older brother John is of a man of strong conviction, who didn't insist on the same strictures for his sons. \"It's true he didn't like the idea of shopping on a Sunday, so we'd have to steal out to buy the Sunday papers. But he'd usually relent and read them by Wednesday.\" Writing his sermons in the evening, he would sometimes watch That Was The Week That Was with them. \"He didn't like the smuttiness of it but he enjoyed the politics.\" Both parents were ambitious academically for their children. Their father because he was the first member of his family to go to university. Their mother because she did not. \"It was something she could have done and always said she regretted,\" John says. He recalls that his father would leave home by 9am and frequently not return before 11pm. Not so much a work ethic, \"It was a simple basic philosophy, based on a Christian tradition, that as humans we are able to shape the circumstances in which we live.\" </p> <p>One of his deepest regrets, Brown says, is that he was unable to spend more time with his father later in life. He died suddenly in 1998. \"It's part of the tragedy of being in Westminster, being abroad a lot of the time. And I think he felt he didn't want to bother me. I spoke to him the night before. It's only in retrospect you realise ...\" His mother, Elizabeth, aged 86, was unwell throughout the summer and he and his two brothers, John and Andrew, took it in turns to visit her in Aberdeen and \"to talk to her a lot\". At one point the medics wanted to put her on morphine but the three of them intervened. She seemed to recover her old self. \"Amazing,\" says Brown, \"the strength of human will.\" But they all knew she was dying. \"And she knew. She was very realistic about it, very dignified.\" The night before she died, earlier this week, he took his son to see her. \"John gave her the most wonderful smile.\" </p> <p>All the brothers were bright, Gordon in particular. He was selected for an experimental fast stream at Kirkcaldy Primary School, went to secondary school at 10. Took his O-levels at 14. Highers at 15. At 16 he was awarded a place at Edinburgh University to read history. Brown's memory of himself at this time is not as a swot but as an all-rounder, \"very keen on sports\". Though even here he was precocious, playing in the school rugby team at 15: \"Difficult when all the other guys were 17, 18.\" It may not look like it now, he says, \"but back then I was very, very fit\". </p> <p>As Murray Elder describes it, Brown went up to Edinburgh a young man \"tremendously good at everything\", unused to setbacks. Within two terms at university he was flat on his back in a hospital bed, both his eyes covered with patches - unable to move or read. The diagnosis was a retinal detachment in his left eye probably caused, or exacerbated, by a rugby injury. Without resting, the prognosis was that the right eye might go in sympathy. Treatment involved a series of three operations, each an attempt to save the left eye, each a failure. \"After each operation I'd have to lie, in darkness, for three maybe four weeks at a time.\" He recalls just before the third operation his surgeon saying to him: \"Well, Gordon, we'll have another bash.\" By the end of the second term of his second year Brown was blind in his left eye. </p> <p>It was playing tennis one day that he realised he was having similar symptoms in his right eye. Back in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, a second retinal detachment was diagnosed. He says now that he didn't fully realise the seriousness of the situation: \"You don't when you are young, do you? You think nothing can ever happen to you.\" He saw the same surgeon and faced the same imprecise surgery. It was at this point, aged 18, that his luck changed. Hector Chawla, now a senior consultant eye surgeon, was at the time a registrar at the hospital who had been sent to Chicago to study innovative methods in eye surgery. He returned to Edinburgh, in 1969, with a new technique and a new instrument, a binocular indirect opthalmoscope, that enabled surgeons for the first time to see inside the eye. Though Brown recounts the experience with a reticent indifference - \"I think history tells you that people can adjust to almost anything. There is an initial shock, but you adjust\" - Chawla is very clear: \"He faced total blindness and he knew. He's not stupid, he's not without imagination, and he knew what had happened to his first eye.\" Chawla recalls him as \"a large young man who put on a bold and brave front but who must have been terrified\". His fourth operation, performed by Chawla, fully restored the sight in his right eye. \"So he was unlucky and then he was lucky.\" </p> <p>It's hard to assess what lying in a hospital bed in total darkness for weeks at a time and with an uncertain outcome might do to the mind. In his case, Brown says it focused him. \"One door closes, you can't play rugby any more, so you concentrate on other things.\" If his energies had been diffuse they now became focused. Brown had witnessed second hand, in his father's parish, other people's distress. Poverty, unemployment, the breaking-up of families. He had now experienced personal distress, the possibility of blindness and all that went with it. I recall him at his home in Scotland, where David Blunkett was a visitor for the launch of the Jennifer Brown Fund, at a time when the media was reporting a rift between the two men, guiding Blunkett around a room full of people. \"Whatever you may think of Blunkett, it must be lonely for him,\" he said later. </p> <p>At Edinburgh University in the early 1970s, Brown immersed himself in student politics, through journalism - his brother John was editor of the student paper - and spending three years as student rector, a position that involved chairing the governing body of the university, something that he now describes as \"not so much a waste of time but, in retrospect, there were other things more worth the effort\". He cites the anti-apartheid movement. Colin Currie, a fellow student, who remains a close friend, remembers Brown as a consummate political operator even then. He had two skills, Currie says: \"He was good at bringing people together, uniting them in a cause, in such a way that nobody felt exploited. And he was never concerned about having bright people around him, people who challenged him. That's a formidable trait in a politician.\" </p> <p>Loyalty, expected by Brown and in return given by Brown, and an intellectual self-assurance are two of the characteristics most commonly cited by people who work with him. Many of his closest advisers are also his closest friends - Ed Balls, Ed Miliband, Sue Nye - and have been with him since his days in opposition. Even Derek Scott, a former senior economic adviser to Tony Blair, whose book, Off Whitehall, is largely antipathetic to the chancellor, cites Brown's strong sense of allegiance: \"Gordon helped his people.\" Of course this can be represented, as in Scott's book, as a closed world - closeted and mistrustful, offputting to outsiders when Brown should engage with a wider constituency. </p> <p>Brown entered parliament in 1983, at a time when the Labour party was embarking on a vast restructuring following the defeat of 1979 and then the devastation of 1983, when Labour achieved its lowest polling since the first world war. He was given his first position in the shadow cabinet by Neil Kinnock in 1987, as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, and began to be noticed in October 1988 when, following John Smith's heart attack, he was asked by Kinnock to deputise as shadow chancellor. Opposite Nigel Lawson I remember someone saying \"his invective flashed like a scythe\". That year and again in 1991 and 1992 he topped the shadow cabinet polls. He was the heir apparent, if not immediately, then further down the line. </p> <p>He could have put himself forward as the modernisers' candidate, or as Smith's deputy, after Labour's fourth successive defeat in 1992 when Kinnock resigned - he clearly thought about it and dismissed it. \"I took the view in 1992 that John was a person of substance, perfectly able and the best person to show that the Labour party was able to govern. It would have been divisive to stand against him. It didn't strike me as the right thing to do, when you had someone senior who was capable of winning public support, to challenge him. And so I didn't.\" You have to infer he would have seen it as an act of betrayal. If Smith was capable of winning, it would have been an act of pure personal ambition. (Since every political statement that Brown makes is carefully weighed, you could take this as an indictment of Blair's decision to stand against him in 1994. There had been an agreement between them, dating back to 1992, that they would never stand against each other. Brown was \"senior\", \"a person of substance\". Blair could have taken the view that Brown was \"able\".) I asked him if he considered that Blair had betrayed him. \"I'm not going to answer that. It's not helpful.\" </p> <p>Though Brown would not challenge Smith personally for the leadership, as the new shadow chancellor he challenged his policy. I asked him if he thought it was Smith's shadow budget, including tax rises for the better-off, that was largely responsible for the 1992 defeat. He said no, \"I don't think that's right, I think we were all to blame.\" Nonetheless, following the election, he dropped the shadow budget. \"It wasn't a case of a Labour party that had deserted its principles,\" he said. \"But we had to change and we hadn't changed enough ... We were not seen as economically credible.\" Brown's supporters would say that at this time, 1992-93, Brown took the brunt of the opposition within the party to modernisation - he was regarded as too rightwing. Brown says the years 1992-94 \"were very difficult, yes\". Did they cost him the leadership? \"That's for others to judge ... That's the way it is. You've got to live with it.\" By 1993 his popularity within the party had reversed. He had moved to seventh position in the shadow cabinet polls. When John Smith died suddenly in May 1994, Brown was not as well positioned to go for the leadership as he had been two years before. </p> <p>Everyone who knew Brown and Blair in the 11 years up to John Smith's death - and it was always Brown then Blair in those days - agrees that theirs was a close, intimate friendship. Indeed, the commonest criticism of Stephen Frears' film The Deal - which dramatised the events surrounding the Granita dinner on May 31, 1994, when Brown agreed not to stand against Blair in return for assurances for an enlarged role for the Treasury and Blair's backing in any subsequent leadership contest - is that it failed to convey the warmth that existed between the two men. There were always differences of temperament, Blair more glitter, Brown the more sombre of the two. But this was part of the reason they made such a spectacularly successful team. Colin Currie recalls, \"I'd be working on a speech with Gordon, Tony would call and they'd spend hours on the phone. It was a highly effective partnership - it is not possible that they disliked each other then.\" This was at a time when both men saw themselves as headed in the same direction, passionately committed to the question of what sort of party they were a part of and what it should become. The choices open to them as individuals, and the future political choices for the party, were not distinct. </p> <p>The Granita deal is traditionally seen as the outcome of a personal contest between the two men for the leadership in which Brown came out the loser. But it's equally possible to see it as part of a long-term strategy. Blair, the more vivid of the two, the one able to capture the heart of middle England, was the front man. Brown, behind him, the strategic thinker. Once Labour had proved itself electable and able to govern, Brown would take over as the front man he had always conceived himself to be. Halfway through a second term would be the logical timing. This seems to be confirmed by Colin Currie: \"Gordon made a political calculation that was based on doing things rather than being things ... If he had stood against Tony there would have been a bloodbath that split the party.\" He was not Prince Hamlet and he did not intend to be. </p> <p>Which does not mean relations were always easy. In his recent biography of Blair, Anthony Seldon quotes one anonymous source as remarking in April 2004: \"If Gordon had treated Tony with more respect, I think there's a strong likelihood he would be prime minister by now.\" What neither had factored in was the mechanics of power, and that once Blair was in Downing Street it would no longer be just the two of them. The so-called Granita Mark Two deal would appear to confirm this - at a dinner held by John Prescott in his Admiralty Arch flat last November, all the evidence suggests Blair agreed to stand down this autumn to make way for a pre-election leadership contest, an arrangement on which he has since reneged. </p> <p>In hindsight, would Brown have played things differently? \"You learn, you learn.\" As it was, he did not challenge Blair in 1994, in his words, in the interests of the party and the country - so it follows that he thought Blair was the right person to lead the party? \"Yeah, I was happy to accept that.\" Later on in our conversation he goes a step further. \"I think I did what was right ... What we had to do was to get us out of the stop-go, boom-bust cycle that had dominated our economy for 40 or 50 years.\" Brown's entire career, apart from a brief shadow spell in Trade and Industry, has been in the Treasury. And he has kept his side of the deal: a stable economy, sustained growth, almost full employment. Blair, bringing Alan Milburn into the cabinet to develop the strategy for Labour's third term, could be seen as doing the reverse. Brown will not discuss Milburn's appointment. \"I don't talk about personalities.\" Similarly he will not answer a question about whether he wants to be prime minister, except to say, \"I don't think about politics in those terms.\" Of his position on Iraq, he says, \"I agree with Tony Blair's position on this. I am not going to walk away from decisions that we made as a cabinet. I made the finance available to do what we had to do.\" </p> <p>It has been said that Brown is a brilliant strategist flawed by his obsession with leadership. It could equally be said that he is a leader flawed by his obsession with strategy. One friend says, \"The thing you have to realise about him is that he is strategic 24 hours a day.\" There are many around Brown now urging him to make the tactical move in response to events of the past two or three weeks. \"It is war,\" they say. \"We are going to have our revenge.\" Various options are open to him. \"He could use the Labour party conference to set up his allies and give Blair hell.\" \"He could force Blair to sack him, go to the back benches and speak his mind.\" </p> <p>But Brown has not waited this long to make a strategic error. He believes that politics does not reward the Brutuses who bring a leader down. Labour has now been in power for the longest continuous period in its history, and if it wins a third term it will be as significant for the party as the election in 1997. While everyone around him, it seems, is waiting for a showdown in the Tony and Gordon saga, Brown has his eyes elsewhere. \"People want us to show that there is the possibility of a progressive consensus that is so strong, so right, that no government that followed would attempt to undo it. That, as I see it, is what the debate has always been about.\" Will it work? Gordon Brown is an optimist</p>",
  "<p>Did you know there are pills out there that claim to make your breasts bigger, rid your thighs of cellulite, strip away body fat and give you rock-hard muscles without exercise? Of course you did. You may even have bought - or considered buying - some of these miracle medicines, and you wouldn't be alone. It seems that when it comes to improving our bodies, we are suckers for a quick fix, no matter how dubious the claim. </p> <p>In a survey of direct marketing literature by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in 2001, the health sector was the worst offender when it came to violating the British Code of Advertising and Sales Promotion. Serious breaches were found in 43.8% of the material, most related to exaggerated claims for the products concerned. </p> <p>What makes normally discerning consumers swallow these far-fetched claims? \"Most people are largely ignorant about how the body works, which makes them vulnerable to the way these products are marketed, and unable to scrutinise the evidence before them,\" says Jeya Henry, a professor of nutrition at Oxford Brookes University. </p> <p>The Food Commission, which lobbies for safer, healthier food in the UK, is constantly complaining about the way \"miracle\" health products such as slimming pills are marketed. \"Typically,\" says policy officer Kath Dalmeny, \"the mailings have a photograph of a 'scientist' in a white coat, wild claims of efficacy and no adverse side effects, and plenty of before and after photographs to play on people's desire for a better life. It is a highly automated and manipulative trade.\" </p> <p>The Food Commission recently complained to the ASA about an advertisement for a herbal breast enlargement pill called Erdic. The ASA upheld the complaint, saying that Erdic UK had failed to prove that its product worked, and the company was ordered to withdraw the ads. Despite the media coverage of this, the pills - which cost \u00a3349 for three boxes (the amount purportedly needed to increase bust size by one cup) - still receive glowing testimonials in a number of women's magazines, according to the Erdic website. </p> <p>\"The trouble with herbal products and supplements is that they are covered by wishy-washy health food claims regulation, rather than robust medical products legislation,\" says Dalmeny. \"There is little enforcement of labelling regulations when it comes to supplements and quack medicines - unsubstantiated claims proliferate.\" The issue isn't just whether or not a product is effective; it's also about possible side effects or health risks. \"Manufacturers, for example, are not obliged to give medical warnings about any possible long-term effects,\" says Dalmeny. </p> <p>While people can and do get taken in by all manner of spurious advertising and marketing material, it seems that we have a particular weakness when it comes to alternative health products. There is an increasing trend for favouring these over orthodox medicine and science, whether it be for combating depression, losing weight or improving virility. As Peter Marsh, co-director of the Social Issues Research Centre in Oxford, puts it, \"It's like a quasi-religious faith. People don't apply the same sense of judgment to such products as they would in other areas of their lives.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the major differences between the Old World, European approach to wine-making and the New World, southern hemisphere approach is in the obsession the latter producers have about the single grape variety. Before Australia and California made chardonnay known as a grape, many drinkers of, for example, chablis (which is exclusively chardonnay) would not have had this grape at the top of their minds; indeed, many people who say they like chablis are surprised to learn it is a chardonnay. In the same way, before shiraz came along, the grape called syrah could stay comfortably in the background even in areas such as the northern Rh\u00f4ne where it is the only constituent of the local red wines. The words chardonnay and syrah never appeared on French wine labels (indeed, it was against regulations, on the elegantly preposterous grounds that a grape is merely the scaffolding of a wine; the architect is the vineyard, and therefore it is the vineyard that should be honoured on the label). These regulations have now been relaxed as a result of the success of New World wines in export markets. The emphasis on a grape variety on the label has led to certain grapes almost becoming brands in their own right. </p> <p>\"I'd like a glass of chardonnay, please,\" said a woman next to me at a pub bar the other night, and the barman responded, \"Coming up.\" I doubt she would have dreamed of saying, \"What I really fancy is a semillon, chardonnay and viognier blend\", and for the barman to nod and reach for the appropriate bottle. Did she get a 100% chardonnay? I have no idea. Even if the bottle claimed the wine to be so, it may have contained other grape varieties, because it is legal for wine from New World countries to be labelled as chardonnay or shiraz - or any other variety such as cabernet sauvignon or sauvignon blanc, for that matter - when that is only the major component of the blend (which may comprise just 85% of the wine). In my view, no wine should be permitted to say it is a grape variety on the label unless it is 100% that variety. </p> <p>How much more sensible, in this context, have been the traditionalist Europeans. Only the Alsatians, as far as the French are concerned, always put grape varieties on their labels, and if a wine is a blend it must use a different nomenclature. In Bordeaux, whatever its myriad other failings, wines are given chateau or domaine names and, in the absence of a back label, you may not know a wine is a blend of cabernet sauvignon and franc, merlot and malbec. In Australia, on the other hand, some years back now, I recall drinkers reacting in horror to the idea of blending semillon with chardonnay on the grounds that it was diluting the purity of the latter grape. But, in fact, the blend of those two grapes often results in a far superior, more complex wine, able to develop better in the bottle over a longer time. I am, then, greatly in favour of wines blended from different varieties. </p> <p>An excellent example is <strong>French Connection Classic C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Blanc 2003</strong> (16 points out of 20, \u00a35.03, Tesco). It crams in grenache blanc, clairette, marsanne and roussanne, creating a svelte liquid offering lime, melon, pear and pineapple. Not only does the blend have a complexity and richness that none of the constituent varieties could confer by itself, but the melange makes it a more commercial entity, able to be produced in quantity and thus priced sensibly. To add to these charms, it is screwcapped, so it will retain its vivacity. </p> <p>Thresher has <strong>French Connection Chardonnay/Viognier 2002</strong> (16 points, \u00a34.99), in which we get the silkiness of chardonnay with the slightly plump ripeness of viognier. Booths has <strong>D'Arenberg Hermit Crab Marsanne/Viognier 2003</strong> (16.5 points, \u00a37.99), from McLaren Vale, a wickedly oily marriage resulting in an eccentric dryness to the fruit. This throws up textured apricot and lime (with a hint of herb), and the finish has finesse. Being screwcapped, it will develop brilliantly in bottle and rate 18 points in three years. <strong>Matua Valley Malbec/Merlot 2002</strong> (16 points, \u00a35.99, Thresher), from Hawkes Bay in New Zealand, is an interesting blend, too - the malbec gives the wine a plummy savouriness, the merlot a soft raspberry edge; and the result is a delicious fish stew red (especially if lightly chilled). It, too, is screwcapped. </p> <p>More chocolatey than many a much-vaunted claret is <strong>Gold Label Reserve Cabernet/Merlot 2001</strong> (16.5 points, M&amp;S), a vin de Pays d'Oc from Domaine Virginie. A standard blend, you might think, with its savourily subtle berries and warm tannins, but how often does it come attached to a \u00a36.50 price tag? Richer, fierier, from the same retailer and boasting the same blend is <strong>Leon D'Oro Merlot/Cabernet Vina La Rosa 2002</strong> (16.5 points, \u00a39.99), from Chile. One of my favourite blends, outdoing even this miracle, is <strong>Domaine Paul Mas les Faisses 2002</strong> (18 points, \u00a37.99), from the Languedoc. This is a hugely engaging grenache and syrah get-together, chewy, complex and mighty from nose to throat. It is available, alas, in only two branches of the same small retailer: Wine Time in Milnthorpe, Cumbria (015395 62030), and Ormskirk, Lancashire (01704 821151). Either of these shops, as the French have it, vaut le detour. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Superplonk 2005, by Malcolm Gluck, is published by Collins.

  "<p>A ban on people with epilepsy from joining the police force and fire service will be lifted under a new law which comes into force next week. Asthma and diabetes sufferers will also be free to apply for jobs as fire fighters and police officers following implementation of part three of the disability discrimination cct. </p> <p>The act, which takes effect on October 1, supports job applicants who suffer conditions often termed \"hidden disabilities\". It argues that people with these disabilities should be given a chance to qualify rather than face an outright ban. </p> <p>Traditionally, diabetes, asthma and epilepsy sufferers have been excluded from firefighting and police work, which can place intense physical demands on employees. </p> <p>While the current rules were seen by some in the service as protecting the public, disability rights activists pointed out that a blanket ban discriminated against millions of people who were able to perform the tasks. </p> <p>They highlighted how the rower and winner of five gold medals, Sir Steve Redgrave, would have been prevented from signing up for the fire service after he was diagnosed with diabetes. Cricketer Ian Botham would also be excluded as an asthma sufferer. </p> <p>Individual applicants will now be considered on their own merit rather than discriminated against. </p> <p>Catherine Casserley, senior legal adviser at the Disability Rights Commission, says the act excludes the armed services, which have taken the opportunity of an opt-out in EU disability legislation. The DRC was in favour of bringing the army, navy and airforce under the act, but ministers supported the objections of the military top brass. Tony Buchanan, equality adviser at the London fire and emergency planning authority, says: \"The blanket ban will be lifted and each individual case will be considered. If a sufferer can get through the rigorous selection procedure, it means they are fit enough to become fire fighters.\" </p> <p>Applicants to the police force will also be considered on their own merits, rather than their condition. </p> <p>Jan Woodhouse, equal opportunities advisor for Essex Police Force, says: \"To become a police officer certain standards of physical fitness have to be met and officers must defend themselves and restrain people. However, conditions such as diabetes affect individuals differently and each application must be considered separately.\" </p> <p>The act requires that if a fire fighter or police officer become disabled during service, efforts must be made so the individual can stay in the job, either by relocation to another department, or making adjustments in the workplace. \"If an existing firefighter were to develop epilepsy, and he was advised not to work at heights, then he would be restricted from going into buildings.\" says Tony Buchanan. </p> <p>\"If, however, his medical history shows it is safe for him to drive, then he would continue to serve as a driver. The fire service, as an employer, is obliged to find a suitable vacancy where the newly-disabled person does not have to compete with active individuals.\" </p> <p>Jan Woodhouse added: \"A police officer who lost an eye through duty is now one of the senior officers in crime management. He was redeployed to a more operational role.\" </p> <p>If you want to know more about disability rights or complain about an employer contact the DRC on 08457 622633 or <a href=\"http://www.drc/gb.org\">www.drc/gb.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Tens of thousands of students will take up their college places next week and while in the past freshers week was about new friends and experiences, uppermost in many students minds will be how to find a job to cover their costs while at university. </p> <p>Government loans and bank overdrafts pay the rent, but they are unlikely to fund drinks in the student union bar. Research shows that almost 60% of students now work during term time. </p> <p>Debt among college leavers is at an all-time high with the latest figures showing the average student beginning their studies last September will be \u00a317,500 in the red when they graduate in 2006. And the situation is likely to worsen in that year when top-up fees increase to \u00a33,000. </p> <p>But once a student has found a job in a bar, restaurant or in a call centre working anti-social hours, their problems won't end there. </p> <p>One of the most infuriating things for student workers is having to pay \"emergency tax\". This is where the employer deducts income tax at the standard rate of 22% and national insurance at 11%, even though over the tax year (April to April) the student may earn less than their annual personal allowance. </p> <p>Currently, the personal allowance is \u00a34,745 for income tax and \u00a34,732 for national insurance. If you earn less over the tax year, then you should not pay any tax. </p> <p>But the trouble with students is that they will be turning up for work at their college town without a P45 or P60 from a previous employer and with no tax code. </p> <p>Employers have no choice but to put them on emergency tax, and then leave the individual to attempt to reclaim the tax back after the end of the tax year (see box). </p> <p>But few will make a claim because, as John Andrews from the Low Income Tax Reform Group points out, the system for reclaiming income tax is nightmarish. </p> <p>And in the case of national insurance, clawing back overpayments is almost impossible (though it will eventually count towards a state pension). </p> <p>A student exemption Form P38(S) operates if you are a student earning money during holiday times. But at the moment there is no facility for a similar exemption for earnings made during term time. </p> <p>Mr Andrews says more than 80% of students earn less than the personal allowance limit and don't need to pay tax at all. </p> <p>\"That is why we need to get rid of a system that penalises students working in term time, making them pay tax when they are almost certainly not liable.\" </p> <p>The Low Income Tax Reform Group believes the deduction of tax from student pay packets is scandalous and provides the chancellor Gordon Brown with millions of pounds of revenues that should stay in the pockets of hard-working undergraduates. </p> <p>Mr Andrews says the changes in funding arrangements over the last few years - the death of the student grant and reliance on loans and overdrafts - makes a change in the rules more important than ever. </p> <p>He says revenue officials have recently begun investigating how they can simplify the system. </p> <p>The problem centres on archaic Inland Revenue rules which date back to the days when only a select few attended university and student grants (or parental deep pockets) meant only the tiniest minority worked during term time. </p> <p>For some time the Revenue has provided the form that allows students to be paid gross when they work in the holidays. This form, however, has never been extended to apply when term starts. </p> <p>Figures from the Department for Education &amp; Skills show 58% of students work during term time. </p> <p>According to a 1999 survey by the National Union of Students (the most recent available) the largest group (42%) is pulling pints or cleaning cutlery in hotels, pubs and restaurants. A little less than a third are stacking shelves or on the tills in shops and supermarkets. A few are involved in office work or cleaning. </p> <p>One NUS welfare officer said some developments since 1999 will have affected student employment, including the rise of the call centre. </p> <p>He said cities with large numbers of call centres, such as Glasgow, Cardiff, Newcastle and Leeds, soak up thousands of students who are prepared to work unsocial hours to make ends meet. </p> <p><strong>What you can claim</strong></p> <p>Students who work only in the holidays have an easier time. There is a form to fill in that will allow your employer to pay you gross rather than net. </p> <p>This means a job paying \u00a35 an hour is just that, rather than a job at \u00a35 an hour but puts \u00a33.50 in your hand after deductions for tax and national insurance. </p> <p>You can claim back any tax paid but it is time-consuming. If you move around from one address to another, you may also find refund cheques go missing. </p> <p>So it is much safer to fill in the forms at the outset and prevent misunderstandings. The Inland Revenue says: \"If you are a student on a course in the UK and you work solely in the holiday periods (summer, Christmas, Easter) you may be able to receive your wages without tax being deducted. You will need to complete a student exemption Form P38(S).\" </p> <p>To receive your wages without tax deducted you must: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Be a student who is planning to continue being a student until after 5 April next; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Not have a total income from all sources - apart from student loans, scholarships and educational grants - in the tax year of more than \u00a34,745 in 2004/2005. </p> <p>There are occasion when the P38 does not apply, in which case you should ask your employer for a P46. </p> <p>This will generate a tax code and allow your employer to use your personal allowance of \u00a34,745 a year to depress the amount of tax and national insurance you pay. </p> <p><strong>How the system works</strong></p> <p>Students are treated the same as anyone else for tax purposes, despite rarely earning enough during the year to pay tax. </p> <p>Technically, if your income exceeds your personal allowance (\u00a34,745 for the year 2003/2004) you start to pay tax. If you have a tax code, either from a previous job or your new employer, you will pay tax on your weekly wages on the amount above 1/52 of your personal allowance. </p> <p>However, many employers will not bother to include the personal allowance in the calculation and will levy emergency tax (standard rate tax at 22%) on your entire pay packet, which coupled with national insurance at 11% will knock out a third of your pay. </p> <p>If you think you have paid too much tax, you can ask your local tax office for a repayment claim form P50. Or, you can ask your tax office (find them in the Yellow Pages) to review your tax position at the end of the tax year to see if you might be due a repayment. </p> <p>You can check whether the Revenue might owe you a refund by using its \"tax checker\" on its website at <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/students\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/students</a> . </p> <p>The time limit for making a repayment claim is five years and 10 months from the end of the tax year. </p> <p>More information from the Inland Revenue at <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/students/\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/students/</a> . </p> <p>Contact the Low Income Tax Reform Group, a charity that campaigns on behalf of taxpayers on low incomes at <a href=\"http://www.litrg.org.uk\">www.litrg.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Dyslexic workers are about to get some much needed recognition. With one in 25 workers appearing somewhere on the dyslexia scale, next week sees two important milestones in tackling the problem. Dyslexia Awareness Week starts on Monday in a bid to raise awareness and point people towards the help they need. </p> <p>And the disability discrimination act of 1995 will be updated, forcing all employers to make \"reasonable adjustment\" for workers with a disability, including dyslexia. </p> <p>Very generally, dyslexia can be described as a difficulty with letters and numbers, but in the workplace problems can be hard to spot. </p> <p>It can manifest itself in different areas, such as poor report writing, a struggle taking notes and general difficulties with filing. A poor short term memory can be another symptom, which can undermine confidence and performance. </p> <p>Mike Lane had been a successful social worker for more than 15 years working in children's homes and then latterly as the assistant manager of a care home responsible for the welfare of numerous children. But it was when he decided to move on in his career, taking a job with Portsmouth city council's fostering team, that his dyslexia became a problem. </p> <p>\"The role involved lots of assessment reports and things really came to a head when I had done all my interviews for a particular foster carer but couldn't seem to write up my notes,\" Mike says. \"I got extremely stressed - I knew it all but didn't seem to know why I couldn't write it up. There seemed to be some sort of block. My boss was understandably angry. Personnel was called in and it was suggested I got union representation, so I knew things looked bleak.\" </p> <p>However, in the depths of despair, Mike did his own research and contacted a disability employment adviser through the government funded Access to Work based at his local job centre. </p> <p>He says: \"She happened to mention that I might be dyslexic. All of a sudden it fitted. I read up about it, and felt it explained my difficulties with writing, spelling and planning my work.\" </p> <p>Vanessa Courtney, a senior fostering manager and Mike's boss, says: \"Initially, we were stumped. Mike had an exemplary record and then, all of a sudden, in his new role we were receiving complaints about him missing deadlines and not writing clear reports. We knew he had the ability, but couldn't understand why he couldn't do one of the most important aspects of the job.\" </p> <p>Access to Work, set up to help disabled people who face discrimination, called in dyslexia specialist Right to Write, which used an occupational psychologist. </p> <p>Mike, 41, says: \"It was just such a relief. I was given an 83% score on mental func tion but only 7% for short-term memory, so at least we were finding out where the problem was.\" </p> <p>It was decided that Mike should receive 10 weeks of half-day tutoring to help him cope with his dyslexia. </p> <p>This involved help with sentence construction, report writing and speed-reading techniques, as well as advice on stress and self-esteem. </p> <p>He also received speech recognition software (Dragon Naturally Speaking) and TextHelp, which allows text to be read aloud. Then he was given a hand-held dictation machine for recording thoughts instead of having to write them down, and Spark- Space, mind-mapping software that helps with thought organisation and planning. </p> <p>Mike said that Right to Write really turned his life around - not only professionally but personally. He said: \"I hadn't realised quite how grumpy and depressed I had been, not only at work but at home, too. </p> <p>\"They taught me that instead of seeing it as a disability I should capitalise on the things I excel at. </p> <p>\"They showed me how to use mind-mapping techniques to plan my work, which I find invaluable. By linking ideas I can plan projects and reports really easily. </p> <p>\"At first they were almost like counsellors with me as I was so low, but gradually I began to feel like a normal person again. They explained that there is a reason why I can't do certain things.\" </p> <p>Mike said that his confidence has since rocketed. \"I have recently been promoted to the role of fostering social worker and I specialise in recruiting foster carers. I'm in charge of 90 carers and 165 children, which is a responsibility I love.\" </p> <p>Elaine Ferguson, director of Right to Write, said that despite such a high percentage of the working population being dyslexic, employers were often unsure where to turn for help. She says: \"Mike is just one example of a situation that can be totally turned around. </p> <p>\"There is no miracle cure for dyslexia, but employers mustn't perceive it as a problem because handled in the right way, a failing employee can be turned into an asset. </p> <p>\"Richard Branson, Jamie Oliver and Michael Heseltine are just some examples of high-profile dyslexics.\" </p> <p>Elaine said she also does a lot of work with business owners who are dyslexic. </p> <p>\"Often part of a dyslexic person's coping technique is to carve out a niche for themselves,\" she adds. \"In their own business, they can play to their strengths not their weaknesses.\" </p> <p><strong>What the new law can do for you</strong></p> <p>The disability discrimination act came into force in December 1996 to end the discrimination disabled people face in both employment and access to goods and services, writes Sophie Borland. </p> <p>From October 1, the law will be extended to cover the fire service, police force, prison service and other \"uniformed occupations\" exempt under the current act (except the armed forces). Small businesses will also lose their exemption along with retailers and other service providers which must open up to disabled people. </p> <p>It is estimated a further 1.1m employers are affected and 7m jobs will be protected. </p> <p>A disabled person is defined as someone with a physical or mental impairment which has long-term adverse effects on his or her ability to carry out day to day activities. Hidden disabilities, such as diabetes, asthma and epilepsy, which are termed the big three, are covered by the new definition. Dyslexia is also classified as a disability. </p> <p>Employers are breaking the law if they treat disabled job applicants less favourably because of their disability. It is also unlawful if an employer does not make adjustments to the workplace to aid a disabled employee. </p> <p>Under the new law, shops, pubs, gyms, libraries, doctors and solicitors will need to make adjustments to provide better access. </p> <p>Ramps instead of steps and disabled toilets will now be a legal requirement. Large print signs will need to be put up for the visually impaired and notices translated into braille. If alterations and adaptations cannot be made, an alternative method of providing the service should be offered - in the case of shops this might mean a delivery service. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong>British Dyslexia Association helpline: 0118 966 8271,<br> Email: <a href=\"mailto:info@dyslexiahelp-bda.demon.co.uk\">info@dyslexiahelp-bda.demon.co.uk</a> </p> <p>Right to Write, dyslexia specialist, tel: 0870 2404809 <br>Website: <a href=\"http://www.right2write.co.uk\">www.right2write.co.uk</a><br> Email: <a href=\"mailto:info@right2write.co.uk\">info@right2write.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Last month I wrote in Jobs &amp; Money about the late payment charges made by most credit card companies. These typically involve the levying of around \u00a325 on the account of someone who pays a day late, even if this is caused by the company's late dispatch of the bill. </p> <p>Such charges are unlikely to be enforced by the courts: penalty clauses are legally void unless they reflect the loss the party enforcing them has suffered. </p> <p>This is hardly cutting edge law. None of the dozens of banks who issue UK cards, and who will lose out if people follow my advice not to pay them, has contacted Jobs &amp; Money, or me, to take issue with what I wrote. </p> <p>Over the years I have had a few of these penalties levied, and invariably when I have refused to pay I have been told that the charge would be \"refunded\" usually as \"a good will gesture\". </p> <p>If banks thought this argument wrong, they would have taken a test case through the courts to establish their entitlement to the money. </p> <p>Closely related to these penalties, as Bob Egerton a Cornish reader wrote to me to point out, are the charges most banks levy for unauthorised overdrafts. </p> <p>A typical scenario is a person allowed a \u00a3500 facility, with an interest rate of 7%, which amounts to about 67p per week. </p> <p>That person overdraws by \u00a3501 and it suddenly becomes unauthorised. The interest rate shoots up to 29% on the entire amount - about \u00a33.98 for the week - and a charge of \u00a325 is made, sometimes with a substantial amount for each day and each transaction on top. </p> <p>The bank is at no greater risk of losing its money because of the extra \u00a31. There is no significant extra administrative work, at most a computer generated letter. </p> <p>In reality, of course, these charges are punishment for doing something unauthorised, and are no more legally sustainable than credit card penalties. On the other hand, the vast majority of people assume that when a bank makes a demand of them, they are obliged to pay. </p> <p>Those who are not completely in control financially, and have to resort to unauthorised overdrafts, are particularly unlikely to assert their rights. </p> <p>This culture of acquiescence makes billions for the banking industry, and should be tackled meaningfully by those who are supposed to represent consumers. </p> <p>It was therefore disappointing to see the latest Which? report on bank charges. Using examples similar to the one above, the journal of the Consumers' Association points out how unfair most charges are, and calls on banks to change their practices. </p> <p>However the, at best questionable, legality of the charges is not dealt with. Nor is legal advice given to how those facing such a charge should respond. A call to banks to give customers \"a few days' grace\" is as robust as it gets. </p> <p> A profit driven industry is hardly going to surrender a substantial proportion of what Which? estimates as \u00a34bn worth of fees annually just because it is asked nicely to do so. </p> <p>The Consumers' Association has statutory powers to challenge unfair contract terms in the courts but rarely does. </p> <p>It is not, in any case, clear that these charges are actually susceptible to challenge on that basis, as penalty clauses are governed by the case law rather than legislation. </p> <p>It is a shame that the CA has not promised to back any member who refuses to pay penalty or unauthorised overdraft charges. Public calls for banks to behave decently have little impact and are soon forgotten. </p> <p>Forcing them to either fight or surrender in thousands of individual cases, would make their worst abuses unworkable. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Richard Colbey is a barrister</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 has been considering a bid to take control of Radio 1, which would give it a share of the licence fee that currently goes exclusively to the BBC. </p> <p>The broadcaster has been looking at the radical option as part of deliberations over its financial future, which have also included the exploration of a merger with Channel Five. </p> <p>The BBC would vigorously oppose such a move, as Radio 1 is the only service that connects the corporation strongly with a big youth audience. But Channel 4 has said publicly that it is interested in developing a radio business, and Radio 1's young audience would fit well with the television broadcaster's youth profile. </p> <p>A transfer of Radio 1 to Channel 4 could be made under the forthcoming act of parliament that will renew the BBC's royal charter. A green paper will be published early next year. In theory, the government could hand Channel 4 the part of the licence fee spent by the BBC every year to run Radio 1. </p> <p>Andy Duncan, the former BBC marketing director who succeeded Mark Thompson as chief executive of Channel 4, has said he is interested in collaboration with the BBC, particularly in the area of education. Channel 4 is also considering whether to bid for UKTV, the joint venture run by the BBC and cable operator Flextech, which includes channels such as UK Gold and UK History. </p> <p>It has been forced to consider these options because it believes that its television business is not viable in the long term. At the moment it must fund its core channel, which has legal obligations to promote diversity in British television, through advertising. </p> <p>Viewers are gradually moving away from main terrestrial channels towards the hundreds available via digital television. A declining audience share means less advertising revenue. </p> <p>Channel 4 has already launched digital television channels E4 and Film Four to protect its overall audience, but it believes these measures will not be enough. </p> <p>The Radio 1 idea was submitted along with a number of other options to the media regulator, Ofcom, which is compiling a report on the future of public service broadcasting in Britain. The ideas ranged from direct government funding to the merger with Five or complete privatisation as well as a transfer of some BBC assets, such as Radio 1, to Channel 4. </p> <p>If Channel 4 were to run Radio 1, it would not take advertisements, as this would be opposed by the under-pressure commercial radio sector, but it could be free to exploit lucrative sponsorship deals. </p> <p>But senior figures at Channel 4 now doubt whether Radio 1 could be as lucrative as was initially suggested, and it is thought the idea has moved to the back burner. It is likely that any deal to secure Channel 4's financial stability will involve a range of solutions, rather than one big fix such as the transfer of Radio 1. </p> <p>Channel 4 is still pursuing other interests in radio: it recently signed a development deal with UBC Media, the largest independent radio production company in the UK and owner of digital station Classic Gold. </p> <p>It has taken on Richard Park, a former director of programming at Capital radio group and better known to a wider public as the \"headmaster\" in the TV talent show Fame Academy, as a consultant to its radio project. There has been speculation that Channel 4 would be interested in turning UBC's digital books station, Oneword, into a broader speech network aimed at the same youth audience targeted by the television channel. </p> <p>But youth audiences are drawn more to music radio, and there have been doubts about whether a youth talk station would be viable. Digital radio is in its infancy and Channel 4 could not expect to draw significant revenue from the sector for some years. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Channel 4 and UBC each took stakes in Popworld, the music TV show format devised by former Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller. Popworld has a cult following on Channel 4's youth orientated T4 weekend programming, and also has a presence on MTV. It is unclear how this would fit with Channel 4's radio strategy. Channel 4 said yesterday that it did not want to make any comment. </p>",
  "<p>Look at any survey listing the favoured career choices of graduates, and business consultancy and working to improve the environment both usually feature fairly high up the list. Now, for the first time, there is a masters course that neatly combines the two subjects. </p> <p>Last week, the first students arrived at Leeds University ready to enroll on its new MA in environmental consultancy. Although literally in its first week - they are still accepting late applications - early indications suggest this is a course with a bright future. </p> <p>According to Louise Ellis, the woman behind the course and a former environmental consultant herself, it is aimed at both recent graduates and those who have been working in the field for a few years. </p> <p>\"We're not only looking for those who have come from an environmental background, we will also accept applications from geographers, engineers, development students - any of the major social sciences. Those who have been working will probably have experience within the regulatory bodies, policy development or some sort of technical field,\" she says. </p> <p>Students have the choice of studying full-time over one year or part-time over two, and the course breaks into three semesters. One of the interesting things about the syllabus is that around half of it is taught by professionals currently working as environmental consultants. Take a quick read down the list of core modules and you won't be disappointed. Social responsibility, business and the environment, stakeholder management in the environmental arena - they all feature. </p> <p>\"This isn't a course that just features taught modules and a dissertation at the end,\" says Louise. \"There are going to be a lot of workshops, projects, and a lot of emphasis on sustainability. I should say it all has a very strong business bias - there won't, at the start at least, be much on the actual science behind environmental projects, although that may be added at a later date.\" </p> <p>The other key factor about the course is that the students will spend the third term on a placement with an environmental consultancy practice, and their research project will be an actual piece of work for that company - either as part of a team or as individual project overseen by another member of the firm's staff. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Louise says she expects most of the students to go on to work as consultants in the field. She says the job market is pretty good at the moment. </p> <p>Home students have to find \u00a35,000 in fees alone, a price that reflects the number of working consultants who will teach. There are still a few places for this year if you can move very fast - overall, there are around 20 places. Applicants should have a 2:1 or first class honours degree in a relevant discipline and, ideally, two to three years' appropriate work experience. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:miles.brignall@tiscali.fr\">miles.brignall@tiscali.fr</a></p>",
  "<p>It's the CV highlight that all employers want to see - work experience. If you're entering your final year but still lacking this essential offering, don't despair. It's not too late to go hunting for opportunities. </p> <p> <strong> 1. Target employers</strong> </p> <p>Scott Foley is based in the business and careers division of the University of Manchester. It's his job to help students find work experience. \"Contact organisations you're interested in working for by sending a spec letter along with your CV. But make sure you do some research in advance,\" he warns. </p> <p>Understand the needs of the company you are applying to and find the right person to approach. \"Tell them you're looking to gain some experience in the industry on a paid or unpaid basis,\" says Scott. \"And make sure you follow up that letter with a phone call a week or two later. Otherwise you're likely to be forgotten.\" </p> <p> <strong> 2. Transfer skills</strong> </p> <p>\"Employers are looking for transferable skills,\" says Liz Hagger, e-guidance manager for prospects.ac.uk and career adviser for the past 30 years. \"These will vary according to the job you're seeking, but all employers want applicants to be good at team work, have good communication skills and the ability to solve problems.\" Initiative and self-motivation are also crucial. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Volunteer</strong> </p> <p>\"This is a very good way of getting work experience,\" says Scott. \"It can be a really useful for gaining new skills and it also looks good on a CV. It shows that you're prepared to support a particular cause and highlights some of your personal values as well.\" Even if it's for a couple of hours a week, voluntary work can add extra depth to a CV. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Talk small</strong> </p> <p>According to Liz Rhodes, director of the National Council for Work Experience, most students want to work in large organisations. The glossy brochures give the impression that it's the only place to be, she says. \"But smaller organisations can provide you with a lot of responsibility early on. You can help the company grow and move forward. And you can actually see the impact you have on business development.\" </p> <p> <strong> 5. Be an idealist</strong> </p> <p>Whatever the size of the organisation, Liz suggests you try to be as clear as possible about what you're letting yourself in for. \"Ideally, there ought to be an induction so you know what's expected of you.\" And she suggests that you should be paid at least the minimum wage or the going rate for the job. </p> <p> <strong> 6. Get stuck in</strong> </p> <p>Getting into highly competitive sectors is a different matter. Liz Hagger believes that your only option is to offer your time voluntarily. \"Get stuck in and show you can do it,\" she says. \"Seize any opportunity to get on. I use a rule of thumb for payment. If you do more than a month you should be paid travelling expenses at the very least. But sometimes it's more valuable for you to gain that experience whether or not it's paid work.\" </p> <p> <strong> 7. Already experienced?</strong> </p> <p>\"Most students have more experience than they realise,\" says Liz Hagger. \"In a lot of cases people have done extra-curricular activities at university. Staff-student committees are brilliant for improving problem-solving and negotiation skills, for example.\" Personal hobbies and interests may also give you valuable experience. \"Some students are in bands and spend time arranging venues and publicity. It's great experience but they rarely put that down on their CVs.\" </p> <p> <strong> 8. Network</strong> </p> <p>Many university career services have set up an alumni network. If you're nervous of networking then this database is a good place to start. \"Also, a lot of professional institutions are keen to encourage younger members and offer student membership,\" says Liz. \"That's a very good way into your chosen career. Most of them have regional meetings and you can go along and meet senior people in your profession.\" It's a great opportunity to make some useful contacts. </p> <p> <strong> 9. Get help</strong> </p> <p>Check out your careers service. As well as getting help with CVs and spec letters, some run presentations with major employers. Prospects.ac.uk runs a live online career chat with a different employer each week. Lloyds TSB is available this Wednesday at 2pm. Many students are lazy, says Liz. And though she feels studies should take priority in the final year, if your schedule allows it, varied work experience is invaluable. It may take immense motivation to find the right role but your effort is sure to be rewarded in the long run. </p> <p>Further information http://<a href=\"www.prospects.ac.uk\">www.prospects.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Not a pen has been lifted in anger, nor a textbook opened in earnest - but it's never too early to start thinking about life after university, and scouting out the internship and job opportunities available. </p> <p>Freshers' weeks are all about fun as new and existing students sign up to a motley assortment of eccentric clubs and sporting societies. But as soon as the Tiddlywinks Society and Tai Chi club have packed away their stalls, the suited-and-booted employers will be moving in for the autumn season of graduate fairs. </p> <p>They may lack the zany chaos of freshers' fairs, but graduate fairs are a unique opportunity for you to come face-to-face with employers who are seeking recruits and this year the Guardian is sponsoring a series of on-campus careers fairs organised by student organisation AIESEC, which describes it as the \"most pervasive nationwide careers fair programme in the country\". </p> <p>Between 15 and 150 employers attend these fairs - from blue chip consulting firm Deloitte to the Royal Navy and Royal Marines; from retailers Sainsbury's and Aldi to gap year specialists like Raleigh International and Trekforce. What began in 1948 as an organisation to help develop \"friendly relations\" between member countries is now the world's largest student organisation, with activities in 87 countries. </p> <p>Run by students and recent graduates, the core business of AIESEC - formerly an acronym for the \"Association Internationale des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et Commerciales\" - is to facilitate international traineeship exchanges. Alumni include former presidents of Finland, Poland and Colombia. </p> <p>AIESEC has since grown to encompass a much wider range of disciplines than economics and commerce and has been providing undergraduate careers fairs at UK universities for 22 years. It expects more than 30,000 students to attend its events this autumn. </p> <p>There's little that irritates employers more at fairs than ill-prepared students. So before approaching any at a careers fair, read the following checklist: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Are you clear about the vacancies each employer is offering? Are your qualifications relevant? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Do you know and can you express why you would be a good candidate? If not, read through your CV to focus your mind. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Can you explain why you are interested in the company and the particular vacancy on offer? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Never, ever utter the question: \"So what do you do?\" Swot up using the employer directory on AIESEC's website, <a href=\"http://www.careersfairs.org\">www.careersfairs.org</a> or read the fair guide. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Explain who you are and then ask a more in-depth question that would not be covered by the website or is personal, like what the average day at work entails. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you are given an application form, or you are directed to a website, write down any deadlines. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Note down who you spoke to at the stand - it looks good if you can refer to somebody in a covering letter, making your application many times more personal and hence more likely to succeed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Follow up the contact within two weeks to enquire further and show you really are as keen to work for them as they are to have you as an employee. </p> <p><strong>Diary dates</strong> </p> <p>The following AIESEC events are organised by students and open to students and graduates from any university and any subject background: </p> <p>Aberdeen Oct 7<br> Newcastle Oct 8 <br>Strathclyde Oct 11<br> London (LSE) Oct 12<br> Edinburgh Oct 14<br> Nottingham Oct 18 and 19<br> Manchester Oct 21<br> Leeds Oct 25 and 26<br> Loughborough Oct 28 <br>Hull Nov 1<br> Cardiff Nov 2 <br>Bristol Nov 4<br> Southampton Nov 8 and 9<br> London (City) Nov 11<br> Birmingham Nov 15<br> Sheffield Nov 16 <br>Aston Nov 18 <br>Warwick Nov 22 <br>Reading Nov 23 <br>Belfast (Queens) Nov 25 </p> <p>Entry is free at each fair - all visitors need to do is pre-register at <a href=\"http://www.careersfairs.org \">www.careersfairs.org </a></p>",
  "<p><strong>The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</strong><br> edited by Colin Matthew, Brian Harrison et al<br> 60 vols, Oxford University Press, \u00a37,500</p> <p> One of the great institutions of British life - a National Trust of human quiddity - the DNB was founded in 1882. It was originally projected, by publisher George Smith, as a dictionary of world biography. After a meeting with Leslie Stephen, Smith agreed to narrow his vision and focus on the lives of the men and women who have been important in British life. From the outset the DNB's scope was catholic: not only politicians, kings and queens, writers, lawyers, philosophers, scientists and diplomats but adventurers, gardeners and assassins. Quite a few assassins, actually.</p> <p>Stephen, Virginia Woolf's father, became the first editor (styling himself a \"considerate autocrat\" as far as contributors were concerned), and from 1885 to 1900, successive volumes were rolled out, crashing on the edifice of late-Victorian life like waves on a rock. Since then it has been the standard biographical record of first recourse, an invaluable tool for researchers. Now the whole monument - 54,922 specially written biographies - is published in revised and supplemented form; in effect, every entry has been rewritten. It appears simultaneously in 60 print volumes and online: while the print version is priced out of the range of individuals and will be bought mainly by libraries, the internet-access format is a reasonable \u00a3195 per annum.</p> <p>The revisions, made over a 12-year period, initially under the direction of editor Colin Matthew, represent the work of 10,000 specialists worldwide. Many distinguished figures in their own right, including something like half the academics in Britain, have added to and rewritten the work of Victorian men of letters; 16,315 new lives have been added, including Princess Diana, James Bulger and Linda McCartney. There are far more women in the new DNB, even though - as Kenneth Morgan noted in a debate on the dictionary in the House of Lords on September 10 - they still only account for a 10th of the entries.</p> <p>There is also a much wider racial, social and professional remit than in the original DNB, and a refreshed \"grammar\" for the layout of the entries. The temporal range of the dictionary now extends from Piltdown Man (4 million BC) and the original King Leir (820 BC) to December 31 2000: the cut-off point for the present edition.</p> <p>In between comes all of human life, from the great and the good to the quirky and infamous. It is the last two categories that make the DNB such a pleasure to browse. One advantage of the online edition is that you are now able to do this with ease, applying birth - and death - date filters, searching by term in the body text - the most powerful function intellectually, leading to the killer fact - or simply by scrolling through names alphabetically:</p> <p>\"Adams, Gladstone (1880-1966), motorist and inventor ... had the idea for a windscreen wiper after he had driven from Newcastle to London for the FA cup final at Crystal Palace on 25 April 1908, when Newcastle United were beaten 3-1 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. It began to snow, and he had to fold down his windscreen in order to improve his vision ...\"</p> <p>\"Baker [n\u00e9e Willcocks], Mary [alias Princess Caraboo] (bap. 1791, d. 1864), impostor, enjoyed a brief period of celebrity beginning when, on Good Friday 1817, a young woman wearing a black turban and speaking an unknown language was found wandering in Almondsbury, north-east of Bristol ... For the next 30 years she supplied leeches to the Bristol Infirmary, respectable, genteel, and apparently embarrassed (as when children ran after her calling 'Caraboo!') by her earlier notoriety ...\"</p> <p>\"Campbell, Duncan (c.1680-1730), soothsayer, was born in Lapland, the son of Archibald Campbell, seaman, and his wife, an eminent Laplander whom he met after being shipwrecked there. Following the death of his mother, Campbell returned to Scotland with his father. Being deaf and mute he received instruction in reading from a 'learned divine of the University of Glasgow' (Defoe, 33), and having already demonstrated remarkable gifts of prophecy went to London in 1694, where his predictions soon caught the attention of fashionable society ...\"</p> <p>\"Dagoe, Hannah (d. 1763), thief ... attacked her executioner, Thomas Turlis, daring him to hang her and punching him so violently in the chest that she almost knocked him down. She then threw her hat, cloak, and other articles of clothing into the crowd in order to cheat Turlis of the hangman's right to dispose of the possessions of the condemned. Eventually Dagoe was overpowered and Turlis got the rope around her neck. However, before the signal was given for the carts to move off and the condemned to be 'launched into eternity', Dagoe bound a handkerchief around her head and over her face and threw herself out of the cart with such violence that she broke her neck and died instantly.\"</p> <p>And so to Z, all magnificently done.</p> <p>Well, nearly all. Contrary to the entry on the half-Lap soothsayer above, leading authorities no longer think Daniel Defoe author of The History of the Life and Adventures of Mr Duncan Campbell , published in 1720. In the entry on the painter Rupert Shephard (1909-92), his daughter's Christian name is Marylla, not Murilla. I know this because she is my mother-in-law. And it was the same Rupert Shephard, not Rupert Shepherd, who painted the portrait of the fluid dynamicist George Batchelor (1920-2000) referred to in the entry on him.</p> <p>Moreover, the sources for the Batchelor entry refer to one JRC Hout. This is none other than the husband of the aforementioned Marylla, one of Batchelor's pupils and another fluid dynamicist; his true name is JCR Hunt.</p> <p>The entry for Hunt's grandfather [James Clerk] Maxwell Garnett (1880-1958) recognises his work as secretary general of the League of Nations Union, but does not mention his scientific achievements; his paper on the optical properties of composite materials, \"Colours in metal glasses and in metallic films\" (1904), is frequently cited by physicists to this day.</p> <p>From my own point of view, as one of the agency's clients, I am obliged to report that it was literary agent AP Watt, as in Alexander Pollock, who negotiated generous advances for the thriller writer Edgar Wallace (1875-1932), not AS Watt.</p> <p>Such errors of detail, magnified through the naughty lens of personal connection, are inevitable in an undertaking of this scale. Matthew - who sadly died before his great enterprise could see the light of day - and his successor Brian Harrison are to be congratulated for keeping them to a minimum. They can in any case be corrected in the online edition. On the broader canvas, Oxford University Press and its partners - including the National Portrait Gallery, which has supplied images for the new edition - have done a fantastic job. The editors deserve lavish tribute simply for having delivered the project on time, a rare distinction in Britain these days. Matthew (1941-99) rightly has an entry of his own, and not just on account of his courageous and visionary work for the DNB.</p> <p>The cost of the dictionary should not be underestimated: while the British Academy part-funded the new edition, OUP will probably have to run it at a loss for many years to come. They have laid out about \u00a322 million; the government a mere \u00a34 million. For comparison, Smith invested \u00a370,000 in the original DNB, about \u00a35 million in today's money. His philanthropy, which is what it really was, helped to establish one of the pillars of our heritage.</p> <p>One of the many dangers of our time - it is part of the current disorder in Iraq - is our willing embrace of an ever-lasting present. As Robert Skidelsky put it in the House of Lords debate on the DNB: \"We live in an unhistorical age. I do not mean that history is not read, but I do not think that we any longer think historically in the way that we used to.\"</p> <p>The great gift of the new DNB - without doubt the publishing event of the year - is that it reminds one forcibly that the human condition in all its shapes, from the tragic to the comic, with infinite degrees of variation, existed in bygone times. Having no alternative, the sun, as Samuel Barclay Beckett (1906-89) opens his novel Murphy, must shine each day on \"the nothing new\"; but we humans need shades by which properly we may see and understand history as it streams past us. Those shades are sometimes nothing less than the ghosts of dead men and women, as collected here.

  "<p>In the early 1970s, the supremely self-confident apartheid machine in South Africa set out to control all aspects of the lives of black people; it would determine where we could live, work, study, play, be treated when ill and buried when dead; even who we could love. Worst of all, it tried to make the oppressed complicit in their own repression; over and over, we were taught that black culture was crude and backward, rooted in archaic tribalism and ethnic division. Apartheid ideologues held that the concept of a black identity was a myth. \"Non-white\" South Africans comprised of disparate tribes and races - Zulu, Xhosa, Indian, Coloured, and so forth - were bound to destroy each other if the white man disappeared.</p> <p>But brutal repression, however beguiling its justification, inevitably invites reaction. Something had to give. Soon, the cycles of black revolt and white repression began. It did not require great vision to recognise that the struggle would be long and brutal - it lasted another 20 years - and that it would be fought on every terrain: military, economic, and, yes, cultural.</p> <p>About 20 of us got together and started a writers' group called Black Thoughts; we were determined to be part of the \"revolution\" we could see unfolding. Our self-assigned role was to correct the cultural distortions that apartheid was imposing on us. \"Civilisation\" was by definition not only western, but European, and civilised discourse could only properly take place in languages of European origin.</p> <p>At school, black students were forced to receive instruction in Afrikaans; English was relegated to a third language, and learners would be exposed to it only through the \"classics\". Shakespeare (except for Othello), Hardy, Dickens, Mark Twain, and so forth; worthy as they were in their own right, these were not African writers - looking for an African writer, our \"masters\" turned to H Rider Haggard.</p> <p>The Black Thoughts collective would correct that. Africa was emerging from colonialism, however falteringly, and, through its writers, we resolved to bring it to township audiences: small groups of students, civic activists, trade unionists, church congregations, anyone who would listen to us. We would infuse a new sense of pride in black people, even the informers who followed us everywhere, reporting with enforced zeal on those amateur troubadour events.</p> <p>The atmosphere was charged with romantic, clandestine energy; lookouts watched out for the police and upon a whistled warning a fiery poetry recital would quickly subside into the Lord's Prayer. It was at such a gathering that I first suffered my crisis of literary identity. I saw myself as a black writer, and indeed, an African writer. Yet it soon became apparent that what I was writing and reading out loud - poems and stories set in the city, in the dusty township, trying to find beauty in dimly lit streets and the hard echo of asphalt - was vastly dissonant from what most of my compatriots were presenting.</p> <p>Africa, it seemed, was the savannah, \"the silence of fatherly mountains and the slow grace of brown rivers\". At its heart was the idyllic, peaceful village, ruled over by grey-bearded sages endowed with an ancient, yet practical wisdom. In contrast, the city was transiently evil, a gigantic asphalt salt mine into which Africans had been thrust after imperial Europe had wrenched them from their rural innocence. Uhuru, freedom on African terms, essentially meant being able to leave the urban Sodom and return to the almost mythical rural refuge. This remained true even after the white usurper was forced out, ceding his privileged place to the black neo-colonialist.</p> <p>As Munira, a character in Ngugi's landmark novel of post-colonial disillusion and dissent, Petals of Blood, says as he leaves the city of Limuru to return to the remote village of Il morog: \"I wanted to go deep into the country where I would have no reminder of so bitter a betrayal.\"</p> <p>My Black Thoughts compatriots did not proclaim their yearning for this tranquil pastoral alternative as explicitly as did Ngugi, nor did they take on any of the sentimental tones of Leopold Senghor's early \"Negritude\" poetry.</p> <p>In the subtle rhythms of stories and poems, village-bred wisdom offered migrant workers salvation from the metropolis and its attendant white man's vices: fast women, alcohol, gambling dens and of course the thugs - tsotsis - that robbed those naive innocents of their dignity and their meagre, hard-earned \"wealth\".</p> <p>Most important of all, each one of my fellow writers had an authentic rural reference point, a village he or she may never have seen but that lived on in the family's anthology of moral tales.</p> <p>The closest I came to a country place to identify with was an uncle's small-holding on a deserted back road to Botswana. But it was a dark and narrow place and no haven at all. Because of its proximity to the border, it was \"being observed\" by the army and our canny relative soon discouraged \"known\" young people like me from visiting.</p> <p>Black Thoughts eventually disintegrated. Some of us were banned, others went into exile, some settled down to ordinary lives (normality was another enduring myth). Yet, as a writer, I persisted for some years in trying to capture that elusive pastoral serenity. It remained a lovely texture in my imagination, but I could not give it the meaningful life of words it deserved.</p> <p>Over the years my guilt diminished and I returned to the more familiar milieu of built-up places, of buildings that lean into each other, light falling sharply on darkened alleyways, avenues that flow with the slow grace of rivers. New York, where I have lived for the past few years, has been a wonderful haven.</p> <p>I have also observed with some relief how other African writers have taken to the streets, as it were. Yvonne Vera beautifully evokes Bulawayo in her novel The Stone Virgins, Moses Isegawa's depiction of Idi Amin's Kampala in Snakepit is heady yet claustrophobic. Zakes Mda's Ways of Dying accurately captures the sprawling, elegiac architecture of peri-urban South Africa. African writers are starting to reclaim the African city from the colonialists who by their association with it had poisoned it as a centre of culture and \"dark, gleaming light\".</p> <p>African literature can only be enriched by this.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bitter Fruit by Achmat Dangor is published by Atlantic Books.

  "<p><strong> Hatchet Jobs: Writings on Contemporary Fiction</strong> <br>by Dale Peck <br>228pp, The New Press, \u00a313.95 </p> <p> The reason why you're hearing about this book is simple: Dale Peck once wrote a spectacularly nasty review of a Rick Moody novel, a review so grossly unfair that Peck became notorious. Recalling this in the introduction to Hatchet Jobs , he begins: \"In July 2002, I raised a ruckus in the publishing world when I...\" Note the dramatic spotlighting of Peck's date with history, the reference to a \"world\" that he managed to disturb, the use of \"I\" twice in his book's first breath. Hatchet Jobs is marketed as an evisceration of the lazy writing that infests contemporary fiction, but more than anything else it is a clamorous display of ego. </p> <p>Peck maintains that \"there are two strains of literature currently in vogue... recherch\u00e9 postmodernism and recidivist realism - and both of them, in my opinion, suck\". Discount the adolescent pugnacity of that last verb, and you're left with the quite commonplace critical notion that the novel is in the doldrums, an enervated art form in desperate need of new directions. Peck rejects the amorphous experimentalism of David Foster Wallace and other heirs of Pynchon as a dead end, insisting that stories must be tightly plotted, credible and emotionally involving. But when such stories are on offer, they stick in his craw, for aren't they merely resuscitations of outmoded forms, unworthy of the contemporary era? And so his dissatisfactions cruise a circular route. </p> <p>The typical Peck review lambasts not just a newly published work but the 20th-century antecedents Peck considers to blame for it. \"Sometimes even I am overwhelmed by the extent of the re-evaluation I'm calling for, the sheer fucking presumptuousness of it. The excision from the canon, or at least the demotion in status, of...\" Whereupon he submits his blacklist - typed, he assures us, with shaking hands. The canon-mongering that serves as a pleasant hobby for the likes of Harold Bloom is thus transformed into a high-octane Olympic challenge. </p> <p>First, though, there's a score to settle with Sven Birkerts, a fellow critic who dared grumble that Peck's reviews \"subtly degrade the profession\". Peck responds with a 36-page extravaganza of scorn, of which the following is only one of several climaxes: \"Or, to put it another way (ready Sven? I've been saving this one up...), with friends like this, literature needs an enema. Ooh, that was probably a bit much, huh?\" </p> <p>Purged of his need to squash Birkerts, Peck tackles a pile of recent novels whose outrageous awfulness he feels has been covered up by a conspiracy of hype. To be honest, the line-up amounts to nobody's idea of the best novels written in the past decade, and many of these books suffered their share of dubious reviews. Peck's own objections are often frustratingly difficult to pin down. Black writers don't write about blackness in the right way. (What way is that? Peck doesn't say.) Gay writers betray their gayness by being too gay, or not gay enough, or something. Moody (\"the worst writer of his generation\") misuses dashes. Whenever Peck quotes a passage in order to demonstrate how bad it is, he tends to focus on (debatable) linguistic imperfections. What others would call style he rejects as illiteracy or redundancy; he cannot see the point of any words he himself would not have used. What galls him most, perhaps, is that this \"crap\", this \"bullshit\", this \"rotting flesh\", is peddled by a smug elite of authors whose \"massive literary advances and domination of display and review space have crowded out competitors\". </p> <p>\"Competitors\"? In the 1990s, before his breakthrough as a critic, Peck wrote three novels. Hatchet Jobs might therefore be shrugged off as sour grapes. But there's more to it than that. There is idealistic passion, and there are glimpses of insight. Peck's analysis of the queasy misogyny in Philip Roth's American Pastoral is worthy of Camille Paglia when she is most in control. Elsewhere, there is the odd aper\u00e7u worth pondering, such as \"soullessness in fiction is hard to come by (most bad writing actually suffers from too much soul)\". Typically, though, once the thought-pro voking assertion has been made, the application falters. Damning Julian Barnes as uniquely soulless, Peck describes a glib tepidity of which dozens of other middle-class English authors could be accused. A sharp appraisal of Kurt Vonnegut's \"cult\" status evaporates when Peck \"cannot imagine the use\" of analysing the books in depth, since he knows that nobody will be listening. </p> <p>It bothers Peck that his broadsides have got him branded as merely malicious. He longs to be \"read seriously, by which I mean holistically\", but concedes that \"mud-slinging is just more fun to read than a discussion of how stream-of-consciousness narration renders synaptic processes in prose\". What he doesn't admit is that mud-slinging is more fun to write. Unfair, extreme statements come easy, whereas fair, moderate ones take effort. Crafting a piece of criticism that is not just true but also succinct, and not just succinct but also elegant, is hard work. Whenever one's discourse grows tired, insults suggest themselves as a way of injecting pep. But a wicked putdown can dazzle the reader's better judgment, can make a great book seem small, can make a brave artist seem contemptible, and that is why reviewers should resist the temptation. </p> <p>Challenged by Peck's \"gut feeling\" about Moody's The Black Veil (\"if you honestly don't believe it's bad then you're part of the problem\"), I bought and read it. Duly branded part of the problem, I was curious to know what might qualify as the solution, so I bought and read two of Peck's own novels. Both were intense, wearying, fitfully brilliant expressions of sexual angst. Only by ignoring their merits and focusing exclusively on their flaws could a critic dismiss them as \"bad\". Peck is such a critic. I'm the kind who believes that fiction today is as unbounded and fertile a landscape as it ever was, and that our ancient friend the novel is limping along just fine. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Michel Faber's The Crimson Petal and the White is published by Canongate.</p>",
  "<p>They married at the Karlskirche in Vienna on March 9 1902. She was 21 and a half, he a little under 42. Their disparity had drawn them together: Mahler was attracted to Alma by her youth, vitality and intensity, while in Alma's eyes, Mahler was as much an object of worship as of love, as much a father-substitute as a husband. Furthermore, he was a star: she was marrying into fame and fortune.</p> <p>At the time, Alma Schindler was the darling of Viennese society - intelligent, musical, good-looking. \"I am the daughter of a great monument,\" she wrote. \"My father, the son of an old patrician family, was the leading landscape painter of the Austrian monarchy.\" Emil J Schindler was an artist of renown, but his origins were humble, and his married life a fiasco. Yet Alma loved him dearly, and his early death, in 1892, was a traumatic experience from which she never recovered.</p> <p>Six years later, at the age of 19, she entered into a clandestine relationship with Gustav Klimt. It was intense but short-lived. Alma plunged into a life of restless activity, turning to music as a means of expressing her grief and isolation. She composed (mostly lieder), studied counterpoint and sight-read every piece of music she could lay her hands on. In 1900 she met Alexander Zemlinsky, who brought discipline to her \"unruly attempts at composing\". Later they became lovers. For all the importance she attached to physical beauty, she remained unperturbed by his ugliness; despite her anti-semitic upbringing, she found herself \"greedily drinking\" kisses from the mouth of a Jew.</p> <p>So, when she met Mahler in November 1901, she was deterred by neither his age nor his ethnic background. \"I must say, I liked him immensely,\" she confided to her diary, \"though he's dreadfully restless. He stormed about the room like a savage\". She had sat enthralled through many a Wagner night under his direction. \"Siegfried! It didn't finish until 11.30. Mahler had opened all the cuts. As far as I'm concerned, it could have lasted till dawn.\" What she knew of his music impressed her far less. \"An unbelievable jumble of styles,\" she wrote of the First Symphony, \"and an ear-splitting, nerve-shattering din. I had never heard anything like it.\" The Second Symphony she knew only from an arrangement for two pianos, eight hands. \"It sounds hideous,\" she wrote. \"A potpourri of Wagner.\"</p> <p>Shortly after that fateful meeting, an anonymous poem fluttered through her letterbox: \"Who would have thought it right/ That harmony and counterpoint/ Should put a heart so out of joint.\" She recalled: \"Deep down inside me I knew the poem could only be from him.\" It was the first of 350 letters that he was to send her during the coming nine years: messages of adoration, admonition, hope and (later) despair.</p> <p>Once the first tremor of erotic tension had subsided a little, he examined the relationship with circumspection: \"A husband and wife who are both composers: how do you envisage that? If, at a time when you should be attending to household duties... you were befallen by 'inspiration': what then? From now on you have only one profession: to make me happy! You must renounce everything superficial and conventional, all vanity and outward show. In return you must wish for nothing except my love.\"</p> <p>Alma never published that letter. Later, in her memoirs, she reduced it to a crudely distorted paraphrase: \"Shortly after our secret engagement, Mahler left for Dresden. Unable to sleep, he lay in bed in a state of nervous excitement, and suddenly a thought occurred to him: 'What if I were too old for her?' And from that moment this anxiety never left him.\"</p> <p>It was by no means the only time her imagination ran away with her. On February 24 1901, Mahler conducted a midday concert with the Vienna Philharmonic, followed by an evening performance of The Magic Flute. Alma claimed to have attended both; in fact she did nothing of the sort. Her diary reveals that she went to the daytime concert, but spent the evening at home, playing through Die Meistersinger. This did not deter her from providing an eyewitness account of the opera performance, complete with remarks purportedly made by people sitting near her.</p> <p>Her diaries are more reliable and often amazingly frank: \"Today we all but joined in wedlock. He let me feel his masculinity - his vigour - &amp; it was a pure, holy sensation, such as I would never have expected. He must be suffering dreadfully. I can gauge his frustration by mine.\"</p> <p>Once they were married, Mahler wrote to Alma most frequently when he was on concert tours, hiking in the mountains or resting at his holiday home in Maiernigg. There can be little doubt that he conversed with Alma in much the same tone and on the same range of topics as he corresponded. Conversely, his studied avoidance of certain topics - notably his work in progress - implies that he steered clear of these issues even when he and Alma were together.</p> <p>During the summer of 1904, for instance, while Alma was convalescing in Vienna after the birth of her second child, he spent several weeks at Maiernigg, during which time he completed the Kindertotenlieder and substantial portions of the Sixth Symphony. On the genesis of these masterpieces, his letters remain silent. Instead, he writes in detail about a sandpit for the children, sends reassuring messages about water snakes, grumbles about an owl nesting in the privy. All in all, his letters to Alma are astonishingly down-to-earth; and, in a manner akin to that of his musical style, he spikes his language with witticisms and double-entendres, colloquialisms and quotations from the classics.</p> <p>Rather than leading the life of a peripatetic composer-conductor, he would have been \"perfectly happy to potter about in Heiligenstadt\". Rather than spreading the gospel of his symphonies around Europe (and later North America), he would gladly have spent his time writing new ones. \"I'm living here in style,\" he writes from Antwerp in 1906. \"A huge room with twin beds (what an irony of fate)! I also have a large, bright bathroom with hot water at the touch of a lever. The other side of the coin is the orchestra. Unspeakable! I would gladly do without my bath if the musicians played a little more cleanly.\"</p> <p>Just occasionally, Alma accompanied him on these excursions, as for instance in May 1902 when they travelled to Krefeld for the first complete performance of the Third Symphony. It was a resounding success. At the end of the first movement, Richard Strauss left his seat and walked through the hall to offer Mahler his congratulations. However, \"Strauss took a progressively passive part in the proceedings,\" Alma recalled, \"and by the end was nowhere to be seen. After the concert we went for dinner. He walked in, shook hands patronisingly with each of us in turn, then moved on. Mahler took it very badly, and sat for some time in stony silence.\" Professional jealousy? Thoughtlessness? No matter. In a relationship that Mahler later summarised as \"bliss without repose\", that performance, with Alma at his side, remained a fleeting moment of true happiness.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Antony Beaumont's Gustav Mahler: Letters to his Wife is published on October 14 by Faber &amp; Faber</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Berliner Philharmoniker with Bernard Haitink perform Mahler's Third Symphony at the Barbican, London EC2 (0845 120 7550), on Monday</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The complete Mahler song cycle begins at the Wigmore Hall, London W1, on October 9.

  "<p><strong> The Night Tree </strong> <br>by Jane Draycott <br>64pp, Carcanet, \u00a37.95 </p> <p> Poetry persuades by the precision of its language, and this necessary exactness is carefully and coldly won over years of drafting and redrafting. Jane Draycott's first collection, Prince Rupert's Drop, was well received and rightly so. Her work had a patient intelligence of practice, and concision of address, not only in every poem in that book but in the very philosophy of perception informing her poetics. Her collection set a lofty point from which to advance. Happily for her growing number of readers The Night Tree goes even further in its elegance and imaginative force. </p> <p>She succeeds because, in the end, it's down to her confidence: a writerly coolness coupled with a sense of a workable, completely engaged aesthetic. The price of precision can be perfectionism, an attitude that can result in freezing before the headlights of your own expectations. At this point in a poet's vocation, the resilience of the personality has a great say in whether artistic progress is made or not. In short, you either freeze or thaw. Everything experienced so far, everything written and read, decides that outcome. It is a learned process and the consequence is ultimately decisive and life-changing. It can precipitate artistic crisis: poetic careers can fall apart, the language becoming clinical or unraveled. </p> <p>Not so for Draycott. The Night Tree is a calculated, amazing thaw, made up from icy, prickly detail. Her attention to detail has paid off hugely; and she knows the price of it. One example, from the sequence \"Tideway\" (a series of meditations on the Thames), is the short poem, \"It begins as with razors\", the lift-off point for which is that lightermen on the river once bought their pipes pre-packed, then threw them overboard. Here it is in full:</p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;It begins as with razors or lighters,<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;its sharpness or fire akin to a ship<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;that is passing, a fragment or sample<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;of something much bigger and further away<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;such as fathomless caverns of silver,<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;whole acres of indigo, saffron or hemp<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;or hillside on hillside of spices or tea<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;laid out like a rug to lie down on or sleep.<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;By capping the bowl like the door<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;to a furnace some made it last longer,<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;run cooler for breathing in deeper<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;its skyfuls of clouds, so that burdens<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;grown lighter could rise in the water<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;like palaces turning to smoke,<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;for a pipe once alight is a dream<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;which is now or is never and ends<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;like a pile of disposable bones<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;washed up on the foreshore<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;where in the same place the body<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;of a river ran just hours before. </p> <p>What Draycott manages in two sentences contains a world. It isn't just the concise audacity of the imagery created here that is persuasive (\"sharpness of fire akin to a ship that is passing\"; \"capping the bowl like the door to a furnace\"), it's also her adroit control of language within the determined rhythmic clarity of what's almost a sea-shanty form (\"a pipe once alight is a dream / which is now or is never and ends / like a pile of disposable bones\"). It is very hard to write this simply, nor is it simple to set so many internal rhymes in place, their gears interlocking almost soundlessly, without making the poem clank as wildly as a cartoon grandfather clock. Draycott's confidence secures the registers and makes a fine, clear lyric. Moreover, she makes significance out of insignificance. Say it out loud; you'll want to sing it in time. Time's the theme. </p> <p>Like the best poets at the peak of confidence, Draycott can also be playful. The way she plays, however, is by making strange, such as in the poem \"How he knew he was turning to glass\", an artful examination of the proofs of that transformation: \"By the playing like wind in his hair of exhalations / from the distant leper colony. / By the images of himself repeated in the candelabras / of his erections...\" </p> <p>Or she can play on expectations by taking something familiar, setting it in another unrelated but again familiar context, and seeing what emerges. I enjoy any ceremony in which literature proposes to science. The children of such a coupling usually lack any dread of reason (while some poets fly the room at the smell of it). Draycott plainly enjoys this observance too, especially in a cunning poem in which Sherlock Holmes receives a fellowship from the Royal Society of Chemistry: \"He appears for a moment to fade, lost / in the fog which encircles his head. / The microphone leans towards him / like a question shouted into the wind / Who are you waiting for on such / a freezing night? Areas of his brain / are needles of fire, clear signals across / open ground. The carpet rolls its red road / out across centuries of snow. / And what is it you fear so greatly? / Disembodied mind swirls in free- fall / beyond the window pane, frost calculates / its way across the floor. As you value / your reason, keep away from the moor.\" </p> <p>As you value your reason, then you probably value good poetry. I've waited some time to read something this intelligent, this sensuous and this crystalline. In fact The Night Tree is the finest collection I've read for ages. What are you waiting for? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>David Morley's latest collection of poetry is Scientific Papers (Carcanet). He directs the Warwick writing programme at the University of Warwick.</p>",
  "<p>Never again will there come a time when the business of buying a recording by Albert Ayler feels, as it felt 40 years ago, like an act of insurrection. His music was born in an era of conflict and danger, when cold war paranoia, the civil rights struggle and Vietnam protests formed crosscurrents that appeared to threaten the stability of postwar American society, generating eddies that were felt across oceans. Yet even now - when the pioneering free-jazz saxophonist has received the posthumous accolade of a lavishly presented box of nine CDs, complete with a book, facsimiles of magazine articles and a pressed flower - to listen to him is to reconnect with a flow that runs against the prevailing tides. </p> <p>\"The music that we're playing now is just the blues of all of America all over again,\" Ayler said in the mid-1960s, in an interview preserved on one of the new CDs, \"but it's a different kind of blues. This is the real blues, the new blues, and the people must listen to this music... This is the only way that's left for musicians to play. All the other ways have been explored.\" </p> <p>From the collective polyphony of early New Orleans jazz to the oblique strategies of bebop, each new style of jazz emerged amid controversy. Free jazz, however, was the first to resist acceptance into the mainstream, probably because it could never be turned into background music. Unlike the classic works of Charlie Parker or Miles Davis, Ayler's music will never be found on a Starbucks sound system. It remains as disruptive and demanding as it was when new. </p> <p>Ayler was a virtuoso who sounded deceptively like a primitive, filtering the grotesque honks and squeals of R&amp;B saxophonists through a completely different sensibility. Whenever people try to describe the sound he made, particularly those who heard him in person, they remark first on its physicality. \"You had to be in the room to feel the full effect,\" said the trombonist Roswell Rudd, who worked with Ayler. \"The first time I heard him was shattering.\" A celebrated American poet likened his saxophone to the blare of a foghorn. Someone else compared its effect to that of a massive snowplough. </p> <p>Like many musicians whose work is noted for the apparent violence of its temperament, Ayler was a gentle, modest soul, devoted to peace and spiritual inquiry. The title of the new box set, Holy Ghost, reflects his desire to freight his music with religious connotations. All these decades later, however, his work has acquired almost nothing of the patina of familiarity that usually softens the work of a revolutionary. The unreleased recordings that nestle at the bottom of the box retain the power to astonish even those long familiar with the movement of which he was a leader. </p> <p>Many of the pioneering figures of free jazz played together and influenced each other, but they were not necessarily up to the same thing. Cecil Taylor, a conservatory-trained pianist, was trying to blend the sophisticated chromaticism of 20th-century western classical music with the rhythmic urgency of the African heritage. Ornette Coleman was developing a form of jazz that kept the stated beat but abandoned the closed structures of Broadway and other song forms, making the free melodies that issued from his alto saxophone into the music's binding agent. John Coltrane, inspired by Indian music, transformed his marathon-length harmonic investigations into a quest for spiritual elevation. </p> <p>Although Ayler remains the least celebrated of the four, he was the most radical in his approach to breaking down the post-Parker protocols of modern jazz. His method was to return to the ingredients from which the very first jazz emerged, to marches and hymns and dance tunes, and to the powerful vocalised effects of the early instrumentalists. Overlaying the music was a spiritual dimension influenced more by the Book of Revelation than by the eastern theologies that were becoming fashionable in the 1960s. </p> <p>He had received instruction in black church music, blues and jazz from his saxophonist father during his childhood in Cleveland, where he was born in 1936. Something of a prodigy, he studied at the local academy of music and played in school orchestras and marching bands, absorbing the classical literature. However, in his holidays he went on tour with Little Walter, the celebrated R&amp;B harmonica player. </p> <p>At 22 he joined the US Army and found himself stationed in France with the 76th Army Band. An informal recording of two pieces by this enthusiastic and accomplished outfit, featuring brief solos by Ayler, is included as a bonus disc in the box. On leaving the service after three years, he concluded that Europe would provide a more fruitful environment than an indifferent America and relocated to Scandinavia. </p> <p>At this stage, he was required to perform the standard jazz repertoire if he wanted anyone to play with him, although his tendency to use familiar tunes as a springboard into the unknown caused consternation among his listeners. The Swedish guitarist Ingemar Bocker, who heard Ayler in Stockholm in 1964, found himself strangely moved but could not help wondering: \"Is this the emperor's new clothes?\" </p> <p>Holy Ghost, however, contains a session that dispels all lingering doubts about his basic competence. During a radio broadcast in Helsinki in 1962, accompanied by a Finnish quartet, Ayler plays wonderful games with the vertical and linear structures of a 12-bar blues by Sonny Rollins, George Gershwin's Summertime and Bronislau Kaper's On Green Dolphin Street. His phrasing may be unconventional and asymmetrical, the strangeness of his playing exaggerated by the use of a pronounced (and highly unfashionable) vibrato, but his choruses are precisely shaped. </p> <p>Several other holes in Ayler's musical history are filled in by these new discs. A 23-minute improvisation with a quartet under Cecil Taylor's leadership, made in Copenhagen in 1962, provides the first recorded documentation of the relationship that brought Ayler to the attention of LeRoi Jones, the poet, playwright and critic (later known as Amiri Baraka), who, in his column in the jazz magazine Down Beat, gave the saxophonist invaluable early publicity. The piece with the Taylor group is described by Ben Young, the compiler of the box, as \"the first recording from anywhere in the jazz spectrum of a long-form improvisation with no overt synchronisation - of time, structural harmony, or song\". As such it was the forerunner of a genre that, within 10 years, would preoccupy large numbers of young jazz musicians around the world. </p> <p> Holy Ghost also features live performances in a Greenwich Village coffee shop by the trio with which Ayler recorded Spiritual Unity, the 1964 album that established his reputation. With this group, completed by the brilliant bassist Gary Peacock (now a member of Keith Jarrett's Standards Trio) and the unorthodox drummer Sunny Murray, Ayler performed a kind of extemporised chamber music of astounding subtlety. </p> <p>The marches and hymn tunes came to the fore a year or so later, when Cherry was replaced by Ayler's brother, Donald, whose technical limitations exerted an influence on the music. Suddenly, the group started to sound less like the next step in jazz and more like some sort of collision between the imminent future and the ancient past. A small group of fundamental themes - one closely resembling La Marseil laise , another based on Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child - were endlessly repeated, with wide variations in timbre and intensity. This group, too, is well represented in the box, notably through its performance at Coltrane's funeral in 1967. </p> <p>Next to the historic piece by the Taylor quartet, however, the music that resonates most powerfully comes from a 1969 concert at New York's Town Hall by a septet under Don Ayler's leadership, with Albert among the supporting cast. In the murk of a recording that barely achieves the standard of a bootleg, identifying individual musicians is virtually impossible. What emerges, however, is an enthralling continuum of blaring, squealing, battering noise, exploding with the anger and frustration of a world in uproar. </p> <p>An aura of otherness always surrounded Ayler's extraordinary music. When his corpse was pulled out of New York's East River in November 1970, the mystery intensified. Admirers concocted numerous theories to account for his premature death, some of them lurid. And while the 200-page hardback in Holy Ghost - beautifully produced and illustrated, with illuminating essays by Baraka and Val Wilmer, and a great deal of new biographical information and first-person reminiscence - fills in the details, the mystery remains. </p> <p>Late in his life, Albert Ayler retreated from worldly turmoil, attempting to devise - with the help of his partner, singer Mary Maria - a more palatable style that would incorporate elements of commercial soul music and psychedelic rock. He failed, and his death in 1970 may have been caused by a combination of dismay at his inability to attract a bigger audience and depression brought on by news of his brother's mental illness. The two CDs of interviews in this package contain strong indications of his vulnerability to public indifference. </p> <p>From his confident early work to his faltering final steps, Ayler was beset by a general misunderstanding of his methods and motives. Holy Ghost sheds new light on a career whose brevity was in inverse proportion to its significance. And what it demonstrates is that, almost 35 years after his death, Albert Ayler is still as far out as far out gets. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Holy Ghost is available from Revenant (price \u00a380) from October 5.</p>",
  "<p>TS Eliot is the most famous poet of the 20th century. For generations of students and academics, he is also its most important critic. Yet there was another sphere in which he formed modern literature, changing the fates of writers and the tastes of readers. This was as a publisher. For 40 years Eliot worked for Faber and Faber. It is often assumed that his position was a genteel sinecure, a respectable pretend-occupation for a man who was really a writer. In fact he was an energetic director of the company. Researching a short history of Faber and Faber to coincide with the 75th anniversary of its founding, I was continually struck by the evidence of his decisive influence. It was largely thanks to Eliot that this small, independent company shaped literary modernism.</p> <p>Eliot was with Faber from the beginning. He had joined its predecessor, Faber &amp; Gwyer, in the autumn of 1925 after having worked for Lloyds Bank for eight years. Its chairman, Geoffrey Faber, was looking for a literary adviser. Over dinner at All Souls College, Oxford (where Faber was a Fellow), literary journalist Charles Whibley suggested Eliot. On meeting the poet, Faber was so impressed that he immediately offered him a place on the board.</p> <p>Faber was himself an unusual and powerful character. He had worked for Oxford University Press before serving in the first world war, had administered the family brewing concern and served as estates bursar of All Souls (he remained so until the 1950s). He also wrote verse and fiction. His enthusiasm for experimental poetry seems incongruous given his background and his other interests (he was passionately fond of shooting and fishing). Faber &amp; Gwyer was named after himself and Lady Gwyer, whose father, Sir Henry Burdett, had left her his publishing company, the Scientific Press. It produced items such as the Nursing Mirror and the Hospital Newsletter. In 1924 Geoffrey Faber had arrived to become its chairman. When he re-launched it as Faber &amp; Gwyer in 1925, the medical publications remained. Their number grew over the years, bolstering Faber and Faber's profits for decades.</p> <p>Geoffrey Faber made it clear that he wished to publish Eliot's own work. In the first catalogue, among the books on health and nursing, was Eliot's Poems, 1909-1925, with The Waste Land (\"now out of print\") and a new sequence, \"The Hollow Men\" - \"all his verse, so far published, which he wishes to preserve\". Soon Eliot began introducing other leading contemporary writers to the list. In 1928 Faber &amp; Gwyer announced the Selected Poems of Ezra Pound, with Eliot's own introduction and notes. Pound had featured in the Criterion, the quarterly periodical that Eliot had been editing since 1922. (The Waste Land had appeared in its first issue, brilliantly establishing the Criterion's reputation.) He brought this journal to the company, editing it from the Faber offices until it closed in 1939. It introduced early work by Auden, Empson and Spender, among others, and promoted European writers such as Marcel Proust and Paul Val\u00e9ry.</p> <p>Richard de la Mare, son of Walter de la Mare, was also brought in as a director by Faber. De la Mare was soon offered Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man by Siegfried Sassoon because he was a family friend. It became the company's first bestseller. In 1929 Geoffrey Faber bought out Lady Gwyer and renamed the company Faber and Faber. There was no actual second Faber involved. Legend has it that Walter de la Mare suggested the euphonious repetition: another Faber in the company name \"because you can't have too much of a good thing\". The firm was ensconced in 24 Russell Square, originally the house of a prosperous Victorian family (Eliot's office, a garret with sloping ceilings, would once have been a maid's bedroom). Here the company committed itself to literary experiment in a peculiarly gentlemanly manner.</p> <p>The ambience suited Eliot - the polite, besuited avant-garde writer - very well. He was joined on the board by an American, Frank Morley, who would become one of Eliot's small circle of literary confidants. Morley, Faber and Eliot would sometimes communicate in exchanges of light verse. Faber directors combined gentility with idiosyncrasy. De la Mare was a connoisseur of East Asian porcelain and a pioneer of organic farming, who commuted to Russell Square from Essex in an open-top Lagonda. Later, a key figure was Charles Monteith, the man who discovered Faber's all-time bestseller, Lord of the Flies, rejected by 20 other publishers and discarded in a slush pile. Like Faber, Monteith was a Fellow of All Souls (the college was Faber's \"other office\"). And like Faber he had some surprising enthusiasms (science fiction, crime stories, Caribbean writing). All would find their place on the Faber list.</p> <p>The first Faber and Faber catalogue, for spring 1930, was clothed in bright yellow and announced the company's commitment to modernist achievement. It included Stuart Gilbert's exposition of James Joyce's Ulysses, widely condemned as obscene and still banned from the country. Laden with lengthy quotations, this was advertised as \"the only substitute for the masterpiece itself\". (Joyce had visited Gilbert in Torquay to help finish it.) Eliot wrote to Joyce in January 1934 to say that Faber \"were prepared to publish Ulysses as soon as publication proved feasible\". Joyce, grumpy at Faber and Faber's tardiness, dubbed the firm \"Feebler and Fumbler\".</p> <p>Eliot's caution about Ulysses conquered his admiration for it. Geoffrey Faber shared the admiration but feared prosecution. Eventually, in 1936, John Lane brought out the Bodley Head edition of the novel, the first printed in Britain. Yet Joyce still trusted \"my friend TS Eliot\" to shepherd his writing into print. The two men had met in Paris in August 1920 and Eliot had published a fragment of what was to become Finnegans Wake as early as July 1925, in the Criterion. In July 1931 he contracted with Joyce for Faber and Faber to publish the complete work. A further section, \"Anna Livia Plurabelle\", had appeared in 1930. More fragments followed over the next four years. Joyce sent rhymes designed to advertise some of these.</p> <p>Buy a book in brown paper</p> <p>From Faber and Faber</p> <p>To see Annie Liffey trip, tumble and caper.</p> <p>Sevensinns in her singthings,</p> <p>Plurabelle on her prose,</p> <p>Seashell ebb music wayriver she flows.</p> <p>They were used, with an editorial expression of sheer puzzlement, in a publicity release. The complete Finnegans Wake would not actually appear for another eight years. And even then, last-minute threats by the author to put the work aside just before completion drove Eliot close to his wits' end.</p> <p>In 1930 another ambitious writer, WH Auden, became connected with Faber and Faber. In June 1927, while still an Oxford undergraduate, Auden had sent some poems to Eliot at Faber &amp; Gwyer. They were rejected, but Eliot wrote to say: \"I should be interested to follow your work.\" In 1929 he accepted Auden's charade \"Paid on Both Sides\" for the Criterion. In spring 1930, Auden submitted a new volume of poems to Eliot, after rejection by Victor Gollancz, and this time Faber and Faber accepted it. Poems appeared in October 1930. Three years later the catalogue was offering Auden's The Orators to those who had been \"excited by the unfamiliar metric and the violent imagination\" of his poems. The same year, Eliot offered Stephen Spender's Poems explicitly as a companion to the work of Auden, further specimens of a \"poetical renascence\" (sic). In autumn 1933 there was Ezra Pound's A Draft of XXX Cantos, advertised with testimonies from Hemingway and Joyce. Three more volumes of Pound's Cantos were published by 1939.</p> <p>In retrospect, the 1930s looks like the decade when Faber and Faber was building a Modernist canon. Prominent was Eliot's own new work: Ash Wednesday in 1930 and Murder in the Cathedral in 1935, as well as several volumes of magisterial criticism. Alongside Pound and Auden, Eliot gave his seal of approval to Marianne Moore and Louis MacNeice. The blurb for MacNeice's Poems , the volume that first made him widely known as a poet, carried Eliot's peculiar, if anonymous, authority. It announced, in tones now unimaginable from a publisher, that this was not poetry sub specie aeternitatis : \"His work is intelligible but unpopular, and has the pride and modesty of things that endure.\"</p> <p>This is nothing, however, compared with the blurb for Djuna Barnes's Nightwood (1936). \"It is concerned with le mis\u00e9rable au centre de sa mis\u00e8re , and has nothing to offer to readers whose temperament attaches them to either an easy or a frightened optimism.\" When the company published William Empson's The Gathering Storm in 1941, the catalogue referred to him, with a fearless oxymoron, as \"the most brilliantly obscure of modern poets\". Readers were expected to have high aspirations. For Christmas 1931, the company published a guide to books as Christmas presents, complete with an \"Index of People and the Books they read\". One of the categories was \"People Who Take Literature Seriously\".</p> <p>Eliot's presence was often nearly explicit in the company's promotional material. Pound's 1938 Guide to Kulchur was announced as if it were a house publication. \"We take the liberty of boasting that it was our idea that Mr Pound should write this book - knowing perfectly well that it is impossible to say what kind of book Mr Pound is going to write until he has written it.\" Eliot composed \"thousands\" of blurbs, wrote Frank Morley - \"so many blurbs as to make it quite impossible that he should have had time or energy left over to write anything else\". He was proud enough of them to keep copies of Faber catalogues in which he marked the blurbs he had composed.</p> <p>Eliot gave the company its tutelary role in the publication of modern poetry, confirmed in 1936 by the appearance of The Faber Book of Modern Verse, edited by Michael Roberts. Eliot proposed this to Roberts, a teacher of physics and maths at Newcastle Royal Grammar School who had written for the Criterion. Roberts's widow Janet Adam Smith, recalling the project 40 years later, described how the anthology \"was to define the modern movement in a way that was not just chronological but a question of sensibility and technique.\" Absentees such as Edwin Muir, Edmund Blunden and Walter de la Mare (good poets, but not \"modern\") were privately dubbed \"the House of Lords\". The anthology took Eliot and Pound as its leading figures and promoted poets whose reputations were just being established: Auden, MacNeice, Empson, Graves, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens. It helped make \"modern\" the description of a special kind of poetry. It would prove one of Faber and Faber's best-selling books.</p> <p>Literary historians notice Faber and Faber's extraordinary involvement in the poetry and literary prose of this period, but these constituted only a fraction of the company's output. Commercially speaking, the company's medical books were more important to its health than anything by Pound or Joyce (though, over the decades, some of Eliot's volumes - Murder in the Cathedral, Selected Poems - would sell in their hundreds of thousands). Faber's star nursing author Evelyn Pearce, sister-tutor at the Middlesex Hospital, comfortably earned more money from her books than Eliot did. When a measure was taken of Faber's cumulative bestsellers at the beginning of the 1970s, the top three were Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet, William Golding's Lord of the Flies and Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral . Fourth, with sales of more than half a million copies, was Anatomy and Physiology for Nurses.</p> <p>Eliot, ever a lover of weekly routines, attended at Russell Square most days. He invariably came to the Wednesday meetings of the book committee, which decided future titles. Meetings lasted \"from lunch to exhaustion\" recalled fellow member Frank Morley. Looking back from today, these gatherings have a collegiate air. Lunch was cooked by Mrs Lister, wife of the resident caretaker in 24 Russell Square, and was served at one o'clock, preceded by the drinks tray. Usually Eliot would arrive just in time for a dry martini or a stiff gin. Charles Monteith liked to call this lunch \"the family meal\". Until the late 1950s, it was an all-male family. The female secretary taking the minutes would withdraw to leave the members to their repast.</p> <p>The masculine ambience undoubtedly allowed Eliot to express a side of his personality that was rarely suspected by admirers. Future Faber chairman Peter du Sautoy recalled that this \"aristocratic American gentleman\" enjoyed telling \"ribald stories\". Another former fellow director remembered the great man's \"Rabelaisian\" anecdotes. It might surprise many that his humour is often what is most vividly remembered by those who worked with him. This was delivered in the utterly straight-faced Eliot manner. \"Grave news from Cornwall,\" he intoned solemnly at a book committee meeting, \"AL Rowse has completed another book.\"</p> <p>By the 1950s, Eliot, now in his 60s, was withdrawing from some of the more tedious duties of the publisher, such as reading prospective detective novels (he had once ploughed through general submissions like anyone else). Members of the book committee were happy enough for him to do the Times crossword when proceedings did not engage him. Eventually it was decided to collect the items that would interest him separately as \"Mr Eliot's list\" so that he could skip the rest of the meeting.</p> <p>He continued as a director into his 70s. It is extraordinary that, as the 1960s began, three of those original Faber &amp; Gwyer directors - Eliot, Richard de la Mare and Sir Geoffrey Faber (he had been knighted in 1954) - were still in their posts. Eliot, however, was suffering ill health and becoming less involved in the company; Sir Geoffrey Faber gave way to Richard de la Mare as chairman in 1960. He died the next year.</p> <p>Eliot had always predicted that the company would not make money from some of its most important books, especially poetry: \"With most categories of books you are aiming to make as much money as possible, with poetry you are aiming to lose as little as possible.\" Yet the last major poet Eliot brought to the Faber list showed this need not be so. This was Ted Hughes. His Crow was published in 1970 and soon became, by poetry standards, a bestseller. His Birthday Letters in 1998 would comprehensively disprove Eliot's wise apothegm.</p> <p>Eliot died in 1965, but had one more gift to Faber and Faber. His poetic doodles had included verse about \"Pollicle Dogs and Jellicle Cats\" composed for Geoffrey Faber's son Tom, who was his godson. (Tom Faber later himself became a director of Faber and Faber; he died last July.) Eliot regularly visited the Faber family home in Hampstead to take baths, at a time when his own lodgings had no tub. The doodles led to plans for a collection of children's verses, which eventually became Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. Many years later Valerie Eliot was invited to Andrew Lloyd Webber's country home to hear his ideas for a musical based on her late husband's jeu d'esprit. She returned won over. In 1981 Cats opened in London, where it played 8,940 consecutive performances. It ran for 18 years on Broadway and is always being staged somewhere in the world (right now in Taipei). The royalties from Cats were providential, protecting the company at a time when other independent publishers were folding or being taken over. Old Possum had exerted his benevolent influence again.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>For further details of John Mullan's history of Faber and Faber, see <a href=\"http://www.faber.co.uk\">faber.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Three years ago in Stockholm I was visiting a photographic exhibition and saw an old book open inside a display case. The entry at the top of the left-hand page read \"Helplessness\" and the text beneath described how people raise their shoulders, turn their palms outwards and swivel their eyes upwards when experiencing it. The right-hand page featured sepia photographs of men enacting the same emotion. The tiny rectangular strip next to the book said it was written by Charles Darwin in 1873 and called The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. I was amused by the exaggerated facial expressions and charmed by the entry, which I copied down on the front of my catalogue. I promised myself I would track down the book but other projects got in the way and it slipped to the bottom of my list.</p> <p>Two years later I was doing some research into the Russian theatre practitioner Constantin Stanislavsky and stumbled on a reference to William James. In 1884 James had written an essay called \"What is an Emotion?\", which influenced Stanislavsky's later practice. Stanislavsky moved away from what he called \"affective memory\", which meant using the actors' real emotional experiences to build fictional characters, to what he called \"physical actions\", which meant working mainly with the body to create accurate representations of emotions. James, a leading 19th-century philosopher and brother of the writer Henry James, made a crucial observation about emotions: you are walking through the forest, you see a bear, you turn and run and then you realise you are afraid. (Before James, it was widely thought that you felt the fear first and ran second.)</p> <p>I could see how this might have affected Stanislavsky in the 1890s, but I wondered whether James's observations would hold water today, and therefore whether they would be of concrete use in my work as a theatre director.</p> <p>I was complaining about my ignorance of biology over fish soup at a friend's house when the name Antonio Damasio came up and a big book with a blue cover hit the dining room table. Damasio is a Portuguese-American neuroscientist and his book The Feeling of What Happens (1999) uses emotions as a gateway to understanding consciousness. There was something rather quaint and digestable about James and his bear, and Darwin's photographs of uncomfortable men demonstrating helplessness, but consciousness seemed altogether more difficult.</p> <p>However, my patience was rewarded when I quickly discovered references to James and Darwin. It turned out that the observations of emotion made by these two men more than 100 years ago have not yet been discarded by neuroscience, although with modern brain-imaging techniques a fuller and more complex picture has emerged. Perhaps Stanislavsky's practice has stood the test of time because he based it in part on the writings of a scientist whose key observations remain undisputed? My attitude to those quaint sepia photographs started to change and this process was accelerated when I read that there has been comparatively little work done on emotions since the late 19th century.</p> <p>Damasio, like James, argues that an emotion consists primarily of a visible change in the body. This change is legible in our facial expressions, tone of voice, posture and even our internal bodily processes. There is a gap of about half a second between the stimulus - seeing the bear in the forest - and becoming conscious of the emotion - fear - and by the time we are conscious of what is happening we would naturally have run several metres away from the bear. All this seems a far cry from theatre until you start to apply it, which is what I promptly did in a workshop with five actors, supported by a Nesta Fellowship.</p> <p>We re-enacted situations involving one or more of the six primary emotions which are universally recognised by people throughout the world. They are happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust. The situations included a rat in a flat, a sudden, heavy rainfall in Queensland, a child's first phone call to his father, a surprise birthday party on Hampstead Heath and a finger trapped in a car door. We studied what happened to the body in minute detail and quickly discovered that it was the half-second delay between the stimulus and becoming conscious of the change in the body that was either edited out of our perceptions altogether or the hardest to recall.</p> <p>In the cases of fear and surprise, we noticed that in this half-second we could perform high jumps on to tables or leaps of several metres. We realised that the delay occurred because the body jumped before we became conscious of the emotion and so we didn't always \"remember\" what we had done. We moved on to social emotions, like embarrassment or jealousy, and secondary emotions that are bodily changes caused by the imagination. Finally we explored background emotions, which are feelings operating at a low level, like when you say you're feeling \"a bit down\" or \"under the weather\".</p> <p>In our exercises James's observation of the delayed recognition of emotion stood up. We realised that we tended to do a slightly more discreet and tasteful version of emotions on stage, compared with what actually happens in life. It was also sobering to find out that there is part of the brain that is dedicated to recognising emotions in other people, and that this information is gathered by reading the body. If we were to edit out vital frames in the film of an emotion as it is played by the body then it might not be legible to the audience.</p> <p>All this work was duly airlifted into my production of Iphigenia at Aulis, which played recently at the National Theatre and in which, if you looked closely enough, you might have noticed the constant flutter of the background emotion of anxiety in the chorus, or Achilles's three-metre leap backwards when he is told he is going to get married, or Menelaus's panic attack when Iphigenia arrives. If the work was clearer I owe it to three scientists and to the bravery of the ensemble cast for taking the risk of acting differently.</p> <p>It was Damasio's book that drew all the threads together and it is a strange coincidence that he not only uses a play, Beckett's Happy Days, to illustrate core consciousness, but also opens with a story about an old man getting on a boat in Stockholm, the city where I first saw Darwin's book with its sepia photographs taken by the French scientist, Dr Duchenne, in 1860.</p>",
  "<p>On September 25 last year, I was sitting at the kitchen table trying to write an essay on Camus's La Peste. In order to analyse a pattern of words in it, I opened Edward Said's Culture and Imperialism, which has an incisive chapter on Camus. I'd read it several times -most recently at Columbia University where I'd taught during the previous year in the same English faculty as Said, and discussed Camus and many other authors with him. Said criticises Camus's plain style, his \"extraordinarily belated, in some ways incapacitated colonial sensibility\", and his declaration that an Algerian nation never existed.</p> <p>I wanted to link this to the way Camus plays on the French word but (target, goal), when the phone rang - it was a friend from Columbia telling me that Edward Said had died that morning. It was very distressing and also uncanny - I could see his words on the page in front of me, hear his voice in their cadences alongside the voice of my friend telling me how Edward had slipped into a coma the previous night and died in the early hours. Ten minutes later I was on the phone to a friend of Edward's and mine in Israel - the three of us had last met one long summer's evening in a country garden outside Stratford-on-Avon three months before - and we reflected on how grief is compulsive in its need to share memories and stories. Then, some time later, I went back to Said's writings to remember him and write about the epic intellectual endeavour that was at the centre of his life.</p> <p>In 1988 he came to London for the launch in the National Theatre of his pamphlet, Yeats and Decolonisation, which had been commissioned by the Derry-based Field Day Theatre Company, of which I was a member. I met him there and we immediately became friends - our conversation, I recall, was mostly about Gerard Manley Hopkins, whose poetry fascinated us both. Three years later, he was diagnosed with the debilitating form of leukaemia he fought for the last 12 years of his life, enduring every month the most terribly painful treatment. He never gave in, and I remember trying to persuade him not to travel to Spain in August last year, because his health was so bad. \"I want to go,\" he said, \"I'm going to make a film with Daniel [Barenboim].\" So he flew to Spain and took part in the film with Barenboim and the young Arab and Israeli musicians of the East-West Divan Orchestra, which was shown on the South Bank Show last winter.</p> <p>Said was born in Jerusalem in 1935, and educated at Victoria College, Cairo (Omar Sharif and Ralph Nader were fellow pupils). During his rebellious adolescence, his father, a successful businessman, sent him to a boarding school in Massachusetts. He survived the displacement and culture shock to become a brilliant student at Princeton and Harvard. He became a professor at Columbia in 1963, and succeeded to Lionel Trilling's chair there. His major work, Orientalism, was published in 1978, and made him world famous. It was translated into 36 languages, and continues to prompt debate and inform argument against certain ideological and racist attitudes that still shape ideology in the United States and Britain.</p> <p>For many people, academic works exist outside politics and history but, as Said shows, generations of scholars have shaped and lent credence to imperialist expansion. In a new introduction to Orientalism, written a few months before he died, Said states that among the major influences on George W Bush's Pentagon and national security council were \"experts on the Arab and Islamic world\" such as Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami who helped the American hawks to think about such \"preposterous phenomena\" as the Arab mind and \"centuries-old Islamic decline\" that only American power could reverse. For Said, the role of the intellectual was to \"say truth to power\", and it was this Promethean truth-telling that drove him tirelessly, ceaselessly until his death. He was attacked in print, received death-threats, had his office at Columbia vandalised, was libelled and dubbed \"the professor of terror\" - he was also attacked for wearing stylish clothes and living in Manhattan - but he refused to stop telling the truth or to stop arguing for peaceful progress towards institutions in Israel and Palestine that were not ethnically based. The solidarity he proclaimed was multi-racial, and he rejoiced in an enormous circle of friends that stretched across the world.</p> <p>Although his many enemies attacked him as an ideologically driven writer, the foundation of all his work is the concept of disinterested aesthetic pleasure. Like Hazlitt, whom he greatly admired, he refused to allow his political principles to distort his admiration for particular works of art. When Culture and Imperialism was published in 1993, the chapter on Jane Austen's Mansfield Park aroused anger among some critics, because of his discussion of the \"dead silence\" (Austen's phrase) that occurs when its heroine, Fanny Price, asks her uncle about the slave trade. The family owns a sugar plantation on Antigua, and Fanny is troubled by this, though to no real narrative purpose (the film in which Harold Pinter plays Fanny's uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram, draws on Said's discussion to make the point more sharply).</p> <p>Discussing the novel, Said argues that it is silly \"to expect Jane Austen to treat slavery with anything like the passion of an abolitionist or a newly liberated slave\". Said refused to engage in what he termed \"the rhetoric of blame\", and attack Austen retrospectively for being \"white, insensitive, complicit\". Rather, he criticised card-carrying postcolonial critics for such attacks, and insisted that Austen's novel is a \"rich work\" whose \"aesthetic intellectual complexity\" requires a longer and slower analysis. Austen belonged to a slave-owning society, but we should not therefore jettison her novels as \"aesthetic frumpery\". This affirmation of aesthetic pleasure, which is the central energy of all his writing, is made again in Culture and Imperialism, where he says that Kipling should not be dismissed as an \"imperialist minstrel\". Kim is a work of \"great aesthetic merit\", and cannot be dismissed as the racist imaginings of one \"disturbed and ultra-reactionary imperialist\". Almost uniquely, Said combines an unrelenting appreciation of a literary text or a piece of music with the pizzazz and ethical witness of what that great Puritan writer Samuel Richardson called \"writing to the moment\".</p> <p>Said didn't begin his academic career as a politicised writer, and anyone reading his first book, Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography, would be hard put to detect a political subtext. Only a short passage on the tragedy of Polish history and on \"doubleness\" glances at a political theme. The Conrad book was published in 1966, but the Arab-Israeli war the following year affected Said deeply, and he began to combine political writing with literary criticism and scholarly research. It was this ability to move from discussing a sonnet by Mallarm\u00e9 to indicting the Israeli authorities and their supporters in Europe and the US that was to make Said into what one scholar has called \"probably the best-known intellectual in the world\". Like Mallarm\u00e9, he had read all the books, and it is one of the daunting pleasures of his work to be given reading lists - Auerbach, Adorno, Blackmur, Derrida, Foucault, Lukacs, Vico, whom he had read in depth, as well as a host of other critics, scholars, historians, musicologists. A brilliant linguist who was also a gifted pianist, and in his last years a devoted friend and collaborator with Barenboim, he wrote and lectured and broadcast with the rapt inspiring delight and joy of a great performer.</p> <p>One of his heroes was that supreme Tory anarchist, Jonathan Swift, whom he praises in an essay, \"Humanism's Sphere\", written in the last months of his life. He saw Swift, as Yeats did, as the most \"demonic and tigerish writer as has ever lived\". Swift did not settle into untroubled patterns of tranquillity and unchanging order - instead he remained \"unsatisfied, unappeased, unreconciled\".</p> <p>Said's death, in his 68th year, was untimely, and it is the theme of untimeliness which he confronts in another, posthumously published essay, \"Thoughts on Late Style\", where he challenges the received idea that old age confers a spirit of reconciliation and serenity on late works, and argues that in late Beethoven and Ibsen there is instead \"intransigence, difficulty and contradiction\". The word \"intransigence\" is a favourite with him (sometimes he gives the Arabic sumud), and it informs his writing without ever making it seem rigid, narrow or obsessive. Like his friend, Noam Chomsky, he takes issue with the separation of politics from art and scholarship, and he also draws on Barthes and Foucault, on whose work he was an expert, to argue against the platonic view of an author or, say, a novel as set apart from history and circumstance.</p> <p>This rejection of the separation of history from culture can be seen in The Question of Palestine, which was published in 1979, a year after Orientalism. After discussing the demolition of more than 16,000 Arab houses during the early years of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, which began in 1967, he turns to the moment some 50 years before, when the British foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, issued a declaration in which the British government undertook to \"view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\".</p> <p>In this powerful, always gracefully written polemic, we see several important themes emerging. One is the failure of western intellectuals to recognise how the Palestinian people were made invisible: \"Check the disgraceful record and you will find only a small handful - among them Noam Chomsky, Israel Shahak, IF Stone, Elmer Berger, Judah Magnes - who have tried to see what Zionism did to the Palestinians not just once in 1948, but over the years. It is one of the most frightening cultural episodes of the 20th century, this almost total silence about Zionism's doctrines for and treatment of the native Palestinians.\"</p> <p>Said celebrates the work of certain contemporary intellectuals, who were often dear personal friends, like Chomsky and Shahak. His work brings the life of the mind and high culture to the struggle for justice and recognition. This struggle is pitched against powerful forces - vested interests, embedded ideologies, racism, and those so-called intellectuals whom, quoting Gramsci, he characterised as \"experts in legitimisation\" - the paid scribes of power who are silent about its excesses.</p> <p>We don't tend to see critical writing as performance - at least not those of us who were brought up on the lumpy writings of FR Leavis. But Said's prose, unlike Leavis's, always sings, and has epic, bravura moments, like this immense sentence from the opening chapter of Orientalism :</p> <p>\"To restore a region from its present barbarism to its former classical greatness; to instruct (for its own benefit) the Orient in the ways of the modern West; to subordinate or underplay military power in order to aggrandise the project of glorious knowledge acquired in the process of political domination of the Orient; to formulate the Orient, to give it shape, identity, definition with full recognition of its place in memory, its importance to imperial strategy, and its \"natural\" role as an appendage to Europe; to dignify all the knowledge collected during colonial occupation with the title \"contribution to modern learning\", when the natives had neither been consulted not treated as anything except as pretexts for a text whose usefulness was not to the natives; to feel oneself as a European in command, almost at will, of Oriental history, time, and geography; to institute new areas of specialisation; to establish new disciplines; to divide, deploy, schematise, tabulate, index, and record everything in sight (and out of sight); to make out of every observable detail a generalisation and out of every generalisation an immutable law about the Oriental nature, temperament, mentality, custom, or type; and, above all, to transmute living reality into the stuff of texts, to possess (or think one possesses) actuality mainly because nothing in the Orient seems to resist one's powers: these are the features of Orientalist projection entirely realised in the Description de l'\u00c9gypte, itself enabled and reinforced by Napoleon's wholly Orientalist engulfment of Egypt by the instruments of Western knowledge and power.\"</p> <p>Again, this is like one of those magnificent moments in Hazlitt, where he will suddenly unleash vast sentences which assume an unchallengeable authority and take written prose into the living flow of intense oratory (as everyone who attended his lectures knows, Said was a wonderfully inspired and inspiring speaker).</p> <p>It's unusual for critical prose to be submitted to any kind of formal analysis; indeed, if we survey literary criticism we'll find few discussions of the prose style of novelists, let alone critics, but it is one of the joys of reading Said that we are prompted to examine his formal strategies. He dislikes what, discussing the distinguished Orientalist Hamilton Gibb, he called \"quietly heedless but profoundly sequential prose\". Said breaks with such prose by using parentheses in the long sentence I've just quoted, introducing a pause and change in vocal rhythm which acts as a counterpoint. He had a strong interest in the contrapuntal, noting it in the music he admired, and characterising it as essential to the practice of criticism. This effect is extended by the three stressed nouns \"shape\", \"identity\", \"definition\", and by those six, again strongly stressed verbs, \"divide\", \"deploy\", \"schematise\", \"tabulate\", \"index\", \"read\". Said's prose gives character to the arguments of the Orientalist scholars, travellers, members of government think tanks, whom he then confronts and challenges.</p> <p>His ambition is to prevent sentences from becoming routine, tranquil, unchanging, and his use of dashes and parentheses helps to shape the vocal inflections and pauses of his prose, and to assist a quick passionate intelligence, which knows that often abstract vocabulary, which critical discourse necessarily demands, could dull the prose.</p> <p>Conrad, like Swift, is a conservative anarchist and a major influence on Said, and it is this openness to a point of view that is other than progressive which gives Said's thinking and his style its complexity. In a passage from Heart of Darkness, Conrad offers this seminal image of western imperialism:</p> <p>'Near the buildings I met a white man, in such an unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for a sort of vision. I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clean necktie, and varnished boots. No hat. Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand. He was amazing, and had a pen-holder behind his ear ... His appearance was certainly that of a hairdresser's dummy; but in the great demoralisation of the land he kept up his appearance. That's backbone.'</p> <p>This passage and Conrad's whole novella, which also influenced TS Eliot, particularly in The Waste Land, is near the centre of Said's imagination, and helps shape his writing.</p> <p>Part of the effectiveness of Said's analysis stems from his attention to Orientalist prose style. Gibb speaks of \"the characteristic difference in the Oriental\". But what is the meaning of \"difference\", Said asks, when the preposition \"from\" has dropped from sight altogether? Said argues that Camus's \"plain style and unadorned reporting\" conceal complex contradictions. In \"Reflections on Exile\", he says that a plain reportorial style can \"coerce\" history and knowledge into \"mere events being observed\". Out of this has grown the eye-witness, seemingly opinion-less politics of contemporary western journalism.</p> <p>The cadences of Said's prose resist the consistency of plain style, as when he argues that the intellectual must choose \"the method, the style, the texture\" best suited for the purpose of saying the truth to power. The texture of his prose challenges that blurred, evasive, timid judiciousness which lies at the heart of much academic writing. His prose is pitched against what he calls \"the academic flaccidity\" of English Studies, the determination of its practitioners to show themselves \"to be silent, perhaps incompetent\" about the social and historical world.</p> <p>Here, we return to the subject of silence, and in Orientalism he explores how a liberal, progressive confidence in civilisation sought to denigrate the achievements of other civilisations. This confidence is enshrined in a famous minute on Indian education, written by Macaulay for the East India Company in 1832, which Said discusses early in Orientalism.</p> <p>Macaulay admitted he had \"no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic\", but went on to assert: \"The intrinsic superiority of the western literature is indeed fully admitted by those members of the committee who support the oriental plan of education ... It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected in the Sanskrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the paltry abridgements used at preparatory schools in England.\"</p> <p>As Said remarks, this is no \"mere expression\" of an opinion, because Macaulay has an ethnocentric opinion with ascertainable results: speaking from a position of power he was able to make an entire subcontinent submit to studying in a language not its own. It was reading Said on Macaulay and then reading the complete minute that made me realise that the beautiful standard English RK Narayan employs in his subtle novels is pitched at such a perfect level - a level with no vernacular resonance - that it reads, with a deliberate irony, as though it is translated from Narayan's native Tamil. Narayan, I remember, was attacked by VS Naipaul, and from time to time Said criticises Naipaul as a writer who tells western power what it wants to hear about its former colonies. He is \"a sensibility on tour\". For Said, the yeast of culture, as Louis MacNeice phrased it, is debate and argument - his address as a lecturer was never shrill or monologic, and the same is true of his written prose.</p> <p>Looking at the legacy of critical theory, which had challenged traditional critical assumptions, his conclusion in the early 1980s was that oppositional Left criticism contributed very little to debate in the culture. Though he lectured to packed audiences throughout the world, and though he had many followers and admirers, I think he always felt that too many people were evasive, too concerned with making careers and with not giving offence. Many liberals had made common cause with the ANC and criticised the apartheid state of South Africa, but they turned their backs on the Palestinians. It's here that we can begin to see the grief and anguish that informs his writing, as he details the \"vulgarities\" of the White House ceremony where Arafat and Rabin made a hopeless doomed peace in 1993. He discusses this humiliating ceremony in Peace and its Discontents (1996), where he speaks of the \"shabby, undemocratic Palestinian Protectorate\" over which Arafat still presides.</p> <p>Said's frustration with Arafat is discussed in the introduction to The Politics of Dispossession (1995), where he discusses the shaping influence he very nearly had on the Camp David agreements of 1978. He felt the Palestinian position was \"extraordinarily rigid\", and along with others who had contacts in the Carter administration, made an effort to make it more flexible. Through his old friend and college classmate, Hodding Carter, who was then assistant secretary of state in Jimmy Carter's administration, he met the secretary of state, Cyrus Vance. That year Said had become a member of the Palestinian National Council (he was never a member of the PLO). Without mentioning his predecessor, Henry Kissinger, Vance made it clear he was trying to shake off the \"hobbles\" that had been placed on the process. The way was now open to a direct dialogue between the PLO and the United States. A message was sent to Arafat, he received it, but nothing happened.</p> <p>The Carter administration gave Said a document agreeing the text of the statement the PLO would issue to get US recognition. Said flew with it to Beirut. He met Arafat around midnight the same day, but the discussion was inconclusive and confused; they met the following midnight and Arafat and his advisers rejected the American offer. Deeply disappointed, Said returned to New York and conveyed the refusal to Vance. The PLO went on to make many more mistakes, which Said details, and the result eventually was the hopeless Oslo agreement, and its sequel Oslo Two. The PLO became more and more bureaucratic, as wealthy Arab governments and states stopped funding it, and still Arafat blustered \"we are on the threshold of a state\".</p> <p>The story of Said's attempt to influence the PLO and shape a settlement is a haunting missed opportunity, and it stayed with him for the rest of his life. In The End of the Peace Process (2000), Said concluded that Oslo Two gave the Palestinian Authority the \"trappings and appurtenances\" of rule without the reality. Like a defeated figure in one of Baudelaire's Spleen poems, Arafat and his people \"rule over a kingdom of illusions, with Israel firmly in command\". The genius of Said's prose, his passionate communicativeness, the warmth and love and marvellous wit of his conversation - captured in print and on film - survive his untimely death. Reading him, talking to him, listening to him lecture, watching him take questions after a lecture or in a seminar, I was inescapably reminded of how Milton characterises Abdiel and the Archangel Michael in Paradise Lost as immortal forces who have the courage to dissent and try to build what Milton calls \"the great place now of light\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tom Paulin will speak at a conference on Edward Said to be held at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, on October 3.

  "<p><strong>Inside Story</strong><br>by Greg Dyke<br>352pp, HarperCollins, \u00a320</p> <p>Thanks to Greg Dyke, I know what it is like to be a popular hero. When we both left the BBC following the Hutton report in January, I was frequently stopped by well-wishers in the street. \"You're that bloke from the BBC, aren't you?\" they would say. \"I am never going to vote for Blair again. You were shafted, Mr Dyke.\"</p> <p>It was a privilege to be confused with Greg at that time. We were both in the same agonising boat - mostly in the right, but completely out in the cold. Inside Story recounts the saga of Alastair Campbell's war against the BBC accurately and well, right through to its grisly ending. Greg found the narrative almost too painful to write, and I found it almost too painful to read. For the rest of the world, though, it tells it like it was.</p> <p>Like the good journalist that he is, Greg has a high regard for the truth and his version of history pulls no punches. His final chapter on \"Why Hutton was wrong\" has scandalously received little attention but it is carefully researched and deadly in its aim. If there is any intelligent person left who still agrees with the beleaguered Lord Hutton, they owe it to themselves to check their consciences against this chapter. It would be a great pity if Greg's book generates yet another outbreak of BBC navel-gazing, rather than outrage at the behaviour it reveals at the heart of government.</p> <p>For Greg, the villains are Campbell, the prime minister, John Scarlett, Lord Hutton - oh, and Dame Pauline Neville Jones and Sarah Hogg. I have told Greg that I think he is much too harsh in his judgments about these two \"posh ladies\", as he calls them, and about the BBC governors in general. At the time of greatest heat last summer, the governors fulfilled their most crucial role by politely telling the state that it was misbehaving and could get lost. I am still proud of them for that.</p> <p>Greg has lived his life as a rebel, and one of his most admirable features is that he has no automatic respect for those \"in authority\". This means that his relations with boards and regulators have been uneasy throughout his career. But his reputation inside broadcasting, not in the House of Lords, is the true measure of the man. Greg is a complex mass of warm humanity, who rose from the very bottom of a back-biting industry, making myriad friends and almost no enemies. The friends are still with him. </p> <p>He is sometimes misconstrued as a rabble rouser, perhaps because he relishes nothing more than a good punch-up with those who do not share his acute sense of morality and justice. When his 88-year-old mum told him that she hoped his book would not cause too much trouble, he simply thought \"I sincerely hope it does.\" In retrospect, I think a clash with the governors was brewing throughout the depressing Hutton summer. I tried hard to prevent it, because I believed that the BBC should remain united when under remorseless attack from the government's spin machine, and I thought it dishonourable for the chairman to blame those below him for the Gilligan affair.</p> <p>The governors had all stood behind the BBC's decision to broadcast the story, rightly as it has turned out, and I told them that I would not sack Greg and remain in post myself. After Hutton's report, for all of its gullible absurdity, it became untenable and unprincipled for me to try to cling to my post. I did hope that, through my immediate resignation, I could deflect the barrel of vitriol coming towards the BBC from Number 10, and create circumstances in which Greg could stay. But I can understand why the governors, faced with most difficult circumstances which were partly and unintentionally of my own making, decided that the BBC needed a new start. How could Greg and I have negotiated a new BBC charter with Downing Street, believing what we continued to believe about the Gilligan story? It was never on.</p> <p>When I was appointed BBC chairman, Greg's verdict on hearing the news was \"well, at least he is not pompous\". Not an overwhelming endorsement, I thought at the time. But, as the book reveals, Greg's enormously admired father had instilled in him, above all else, a hatred of pomposity. His father apparently wanted him to be an insurance clerk. Having been his boss for a few years, I can exclusively reveal that he would have made the worst insurance clerk in the history of the world. But as an inspirational leader of 30,000 people in the BBC, he had the mantle of greatness on his shoulders. It is a crying shame that this mantle was prematurely snatched from him, but at least that has freed him to say what he really thinks about Campbell and Hutton. As director general, he could never have done so.</p> <p>The book remedies that gap. Greg does not claim that everything we did at the BBC last year was perfect. How could he? We made errors. But he does squarely lay the blame where the bulk of it should properly lie. Greg says that, in pursuing an illegitimate complaint, Campbell behaved like \"a deranged, vindictive bastard\", on the verge of losing a full set of marbles. In my view, Campbell has many admirable qualities, but was undoubtedly going through a bad patch which made life for the rest of us (the prime minister, for example) almost impossible.</p> <p>Contrary to current myths, the BBC painstakingly investigated the Campbell complaint, and repeatedly asked him to bring evidence showing that the Gilligan story was \"a mountain of untruth\" (Blair), or \"100% wrong\" (Campbell). It is just plain ignorant to accuse us of failing to investigate Campbell's complaint. We lived with nothing else for weeks, and knew that parts of the Gilligan report were not directly corroborated by his notes of his conversation with Kelly. But Gilligan stated repeatedly that his notes did not cover the whole conversation, and said that Kelly had told him everything that had been reported. We believed him - and I am not sorry that we did, for the tape recording of Kelly's conversation with Susan Watts subsequently showed that Gilligan had been much closer to 100% right than 100% wrong. The failure of Newsnight to divulge the content of this tape to the director general except under legal duress, even after Kelly had died, was a serious failing, perhaps the most serious made inside the BBC last year. Only in the BBC could the \"protection of sources\" from the editor-in-chief himself be defended as sensible behaviour.</p> <p>Had he been in the right, Campbell could easily have brought forward the successive drafts of the September intelligence dossier, thus ending the debate immediately. After the Hutton report, Campbell chose to label both Greg and myself, personally, as liars. Yet Greg reminds us that Campbell had deliberately misled the FAC by telling them that the successive drafts of the dossier had never been changed on the 45-minute point. If he had cooperated with a normal BBC complaints process, this would have been shown to have been completely untrue.</p> <p>Hutton of course missed this and almost everything else. Inspector Clouseau would have been a more forensic sleuth. But Lord Butler dug deeper, and in the most effective chapter of the book, Greg shows how the Butler report substantiates much of what Gilligan had broadcast. The 45-minute claim had indeed been sexed up, in order to justify a decision to go to war which had in effect been taken months earlier. Butler shied away from saying who was to blame, but Greg's account is formidable and suggests that Campbell, alongside the now-promoted Scarlett, did the deed. We cannot precisely say whether Blair knew as much at the time. I still trust not.</p> <p>In Britain, there are several public offices where the incumbents have a duty to serve the entire public, and not the narrow interests of the government of the day. Among them are most certainly the chairman and director general of the BBC, as well as the heads of the intelligence agencies and the civil service, the judiciary and the select committees of the House of Commons. Greg and I have the consolation of knowing that we maintained these standards of independence during the BBC's most testing period in recent years. Can all of the others really say the same?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Gavyn Davies is a former chairman of the BBC</p>",
  "Hundreds of rural bus routes in England may be stopped under government plans to merge two national agencies and hand funding to regional bodies. Campaigners said yesterday that some networks were already being slashed as a prelude to big cuts forced by a sweeping reorganisation of countryside services. <p>The cuts are an unintended consequence of a rural review by the Labour peer Lord Haskins. He recommended merging the Countryside Agency, which helps fund bus services and other, innovative transport schemes, with the conservation body English Nature. </p> <p>Next year the two bodies are to combine informally. Legislation will be needed to create a new rural organisation after the general election. But from 2006, part of the Countryside Agency's budget will be handed to eight regional development bodies, with little guarantee the money will go to transport. </p> <p>Colin Speakman, a transport consultant, said the cuts were already being felt. \"Many excellent schemes helping the most vulnerable in rural areas are either threatened or cut. If this had been done by a hard-nosed, cash-saving Conservative government, there'd be outrage.\" </p> <p>Part of the problem arises from the scrapping of the Countryside Agency's rural transport programme, which channels about \u00a312m annually to fragile and new services, with county councils often providing matching funds. </p> <p>\"Exactly how the government's objectives for a socially inclusive countryside is serviced by scrapping this programme is impossible to understand,\" said Mr Speakman. </p> <p>Research he has undertaken found that 86 rural transport schemes had been supported over a 2-year period. \"Cutting this is an act of bureaucratic meanness if not madness,\" he added. \"Local councils strapped for cash will not be able to fill the gap.\" </p> <p>Jaki Bayly, the Countryside Agency's head of transport, acknowledged that some services could be at risk. Since 1998, the agency had supported about 1,000 services: \"There is concern about services because of the changes in the way funding for transport is run ... and other schemes are coming to an end.\" </p> <p>The agency has introduced other projects which risk being scrapped. One is a \"wheels to work\" scheme under which young people looking for work in remote areas - or travelling to a new job - can hire a moped cheaply for six months.</p>",
  "<p>You are at work. The morning coffee break has occasioned a need to visit the loo. As you get back to your desk a red-tinged internal company email message flashes on your computer screen. \"Analysis of your urine deposit at 11.24am shows that you have consumed excessive alcohol in the past 24 hours.

Please contact your local police station. Do not drive.\"</p> <p>It is a bad morning already, but it is set to get worse. A message from the NHS Genetic Monitoring Authority pops up in your email inbox (snail mail ceased to operate years ago). \"From your recent blood sample we have detected serious flaws in one your genes. You are hereby notified that you are to cease any sexual relations until you have undergone genetic rectification therapy. Failure to comply is an imprisonable offence.\" It sounds a bit far-fetched, doesn't it? But maybe it's not such a leap. Much of this surveillance technology is already in place or under development. And this scenario is just one example of the power of data matching - the sharing of someone's personal data across different computer systems to draw up a complete detailed picture of their lifestyle.</p> <p>A Japanese company has already developed a toilet - targeted for use in large companies - that can analyse whether an employee has recently used illegal recreational drugs such as cocaine or heroin. Numberplate recognition cameras are in place in a number of key British motorways, enabling police to track stolen or suspect vehicles. Facial recognition for CCTV is still in the early stages of development but has already been tried out in the London borough of Newham and other locations. The trials were not wholly successful, but the technology will improve. Leeds University's Institute for Transport Studies has developed a communication box that could be fitted to all vehicles to regulate traffic speed and flow. Immobilisers will be no great problem. </p> <p>As for gene surveillance, experts only need a tiny piece of hair or other cells from our bodies to draw all sorts of conclusions about our genetic inheritance, our parentage, the diseases we are prone to and what is likely to cause our eventual death.</p> <p>All that technology will be at the service of the government, and by 2020 its use will force us to consider the delicate balance between the freedom of the individual and intrusion into our daily lives by the state. </p> <p>The excuse given to justify this technological encroachment into our everyday lives is that our rulers are acting for the \"common good\". Forcibly restricting a heavy drinker's alcohol intake seems like a mundane intervention - and almost a helpful one - compared with the threats from totalitarian regimes of the past. Does punishment for drink-driving really compare with being carted off to the gulags in the days of the Soviet Union? It should do: it is part of the same continuum of state intervention, and it raises the question of where that intervention will end.</p> <p>The apocalyptic school of civil libertarianism holds that the freedom of the individual is already being seriously compromised, and that the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 gave politicians an excuse to introduce ever more repressive laws and technology. \"The 'war on terrorism' has turned into an ongoing 'war on freedom and democracy', which is now setting new norms - where accountability, scrutiny and human rights protections are luxuries to be curtailed or discarded in defence of 'democracy',\" says Tony Bunyan of Statewatch, which monitors civil liberties in the EU.</p> <p>The members of this apocalyptic school believe liberal democracy, which historically has protected us from the tendency of the state to encroach in our lives, is now either dying or already dead. It is being replaced by a creeping authoritarianism. </p> <p>Bunyan says liberal democracy reached its zenith during the last days of the cold war. \"During this period liberal democracy had to have some substance, some tangible reality in opposition to Soviet-style communism. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 it was not just the USSR that disappeared but with it, too, the content of liberal democracy's political culture.\" </p> <p>Simon Davies of Privacy International has an equally bleak take on the state of civil liberties: \"The default has clearly shifted from privacy to surveillance. Almost all large government projects attempt to compromise the right of privacy. The proclaimed need for the protection of children and the fight against terrorism has often been shamelessly used as the pretext for privacy invasion.\"</p> <p>Others, such as Barry Hugill of Liberty, take a less pessimistic view of the state of our freedoms, but even these relative optimists warn that many threats to personal liberty have already manifested themselves. But, Hugill warns: \"People are not aware of much of what is happening.\"</p> <p>Twenty years ago, fears of a Big Brother state were commonplace. Not only were we in the year of Orwell's dystopia, but during the miners' strike the Thatcher government had used the state's ability to make covert interventions in our lives in its fight against the National Union of Mineworkers. The undercover operations of MI5 and the police have disgusted many who bore no sympathy for Arthur Scargill or his fight. Surely we are really in much less danger from the thought police than we were then?</p> <p>The answer, of course, is no, not least because the battleground on which we fight to preserve our liberties and privacy is now so much wider. Civil libertarians are now as concerned about the right to individual privacy as about the issue of political control. \"Privacy is the right on which all other rights rest,\" says Davies. That is why campaigns against developments such as mandatory ID cards and the surveillance culture are couched in the terms of protecting individual privacy.</p> <p>\"What has occurred in the last 15 years is that there has been a systematic attack on the concept of individual rights, especially privacy,\" says Davies. Where has the state extended itself too far into the private sphere? \"It is easier to give examples of where it hasn't gone too far. Nearly every piece of legislation in the past five years has gone too far.\" </p> <p>Why, then, have we not risen up in protest? Perhaps because we trust our government more than we used to. That is the perspective of Conor Gearty, the director of the Centre for the Study of Human Rights at the London School of Economics. He believes there has been a profound political shift over the past 20 years. \"Maybe I'm getting old but I think we live in a different world from the days of Mrs Thatcher. The days when my Irish mates would get hauled out of their homes in Kilburn by the police are gone, I hope,\" says Gearty, an Irishman whose view of state power was shaped by the Troubles. \"My impression is that there is not an inevitable spiral towards Big Brother and the repressive state. I think this culture is much more open than people expected. The detention [of terror suspects] is a huge political crisis, but I would be cautious about saying 'Oh, Big Brother is just around the corner.'</p> <p>\"Where I would differ with some of the more republican/socialist libertarians is that I do not believe that advance of technology always fuels the antagonistic state.\"</p> <p>He thinks a new social contract has been drawn up between the government and the public. That is what has allowed the recent legislation to extend the powers of the state, through the police, in dealing with terrorism and crime. \"These laws are passed but the public expects checks and balances to them to be put in place. The issue for me is one of accountability.\" </p> <p>As long as people are sure the state can be held accountable in the event of an abuse of its powers, says Gearty, they are willing to see changes to their liberties as a process to be managed rather than resisted. He cites the recent ruling by the House of Lords that allowed the police to take DNA samples of suspects even if they are not charged. The Lords were willing to allow the police that right, he says, because the safeguards concerning the use of the DNA were sufficient to ensure there was no contravention of human rights legislation.</p> <p>Simon Davies profoundly disagrees with Gearty's analysis. He believes the current government's authoritarian tendencies have been heavily influenced by the philosophy of communitarianism, as espoused by the US sociologist Amitai Etzioni, the author of The Limits of Privacy.</p> <p>The Etzioni model of communitarianism holds that individual rights must be balanced against the concern for the common good. He favours testing infants for HIV, opposes encrypted messages, favours national ID cards, and proposes isolating sex offenders in villages akin to leper colonies. \"If you look at Labour's policy documents and legislation it is riddled with concepts of 'the common good' which take their cue from Etzioni's philosophy,\" says Davies. \"It is this concept of acting in the interest of the majority that has caused the erosion of the idea of individual freedom and privacy. In this dogma all individualism is seen as an expression of selfishness. It allows the government to justify potentially repressive laws.\" </p> <p>But do we not still have privacy in much of our personal life? No, says Davies, we don't. \"You might not want your bank account to be public knowledge, but just look at the tranche of people, from the police to civil servants, who are now entitled to look at your account without your knowledge. That's not privacy.\"</p> <p>Gearty, however, argues there is no immutable right to privacy. \"What's the big deal about privacy? I'm not just for individual autonomy,\" he says. \"It's just out of kilter with the way we live. Part and parcel of society is the invasion of privacy, it is why we live together. It is part of civilised society.\"</p> <p>He suggests the public do not share campaigners' concerns about the multiplication of CCTV cameras - of which we have more per head of population than any other country in the world - and other surveillance devices. The reason is that people see the benefits - helping the police crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour - as outweighing the drawbacks. \"The disjunction between state and the public may be less wide than we may generally think,\" he says. \"Liberal concerns over CCTV and its impact on privacy may not be shared by the public at large.\"</p> <p>It matters that these issues are thrashed out now, because the rights we are currently surrendering to the state are those we will not have in 2020. And governments - the bodies that exercise the powers we grant them - change. So while you may trust Tony Blair, David Blunkett et al to use wisely the powers to interfere in your life that they have accumulated since 1997, how will you feel if a government of a different shade comes in and takes a different view about what constitutes appropriate usage? </p> <p>The possibility of today's anti-crime legislation becoming the planks of tomorrow's repressive state increases with every rise in global tension, because a threatened government is a dangerous government. What happens if Britain's security is in question? What if Islamic fundamentalism develops into an even more potent political force, or if oil shortages lead to global political instability? How, then, would the government of 2020 use the powers it will have at its disposal?</p> <p>\"That's a serious point,\" says Gearty. \"I don't see that happening at the moment, but if we did have a new Thatcher who saw the enemy within and if the police reverted to their ways of the 1980s, that's a real concern. It is not vacuous.\"</p> <p>Some argue the repressive state is already taking root in our society. Tony Bunyan suggests some sections of the community are already bearing the full force of new laws. British Muslims, for example, have felt pressure from both the state and non-Muslim Britons with the launch of large-scale anti-terrorism operations over the past three years. Nor is the fear confined to radical Islam: moderate community leaders in areas where young Muslim men have been arrested under the Terrorism Act fear that Muslims - like the miners and black youths before them - will become tainted as the enemies within.</p> <p>For many, though, the most likely threat to liberty in 2020 will be not political control but overweening nannyism. You are more likely to see your privacy encroached upon \"for your own good\" than because you pose a threat to the peace and democracy. So if you have an obesity problem but cannot resist slipping an eight-pack of burgers and half a dozen doughnuts into your supermarket trolley, expect trouble at the checkout. It is not too far-fetched to believe that the supermarket, under mandatory government requirements, will have programmed your storecard to stop you buying food with a high fat content. You might be prevented from buying more than 10 cigarettes a day or 12 units of alcohol a week. And the government will fall back on a \"common good\" argument to justify this: why should responsible eaters and drinkers have to pay the costs to the NHS of treating indisciplined sybarites who brought their woes on themselves? \"My sense is that by 2020, if current trends continue, the right to privacy for the individual will be an exception,\" says Simon Davies.</p> <p>But in another curious twist, there will be those who will benefit from the extension of surveillance technology. People who at present are, of necessity, dependent on others may find themselves gaining a greater measure of personal independence.</p> <p>Jeremy Myerson, who is professor of design studies at the Royal College of Art, has examined the relationship between design and social and technological change and sees benefits accruing from surveillance. \"By 2020 it is forecast that more than half the European population will be over 50. This is going to have a dramatic effect on the way we care for people, and the burden it puts on the NHS,\" he told the Guardian in July last year. \"Surveillance systems in the home can monitor people and keep them out of institutions. It may seem Big Brotherish, but it's actually about giving people their independence.\"</p> <p>There are no easy answers to the questions raised by the incursions into our liberties. If people are going to accept ever increasing surveillance - in the home, at work, on the street, in the shops - they will need to be convinced it really is for their benefit, not for some sinister purpose. The problem we face in securing the future is that we live in a time of centrist government and economic prosperity, where there are no great issues rending society: exactly the kind of period in which freedoms can be limited without anyone kicking up too much of a fuss. As Gearty, who rejects the view that our liberties are doomed, says: \"We need to keep the culture vigilant about abuse of executive power and to keep parliament mindful to insist on safeguards to new laws.\"</p> <p>We might also recall the observation of another Irishman, the Georgian statesman and judge John Philpot Curran: \"The condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance; which condition if he break, servitude is at once the consequence of his crime, and the punishment of his guilt.\"</p>",
  "<p>Parents worried about where their children are will be able to check up on them using technology that can locate their mobile phones, under new industry guidelines released yesterday.</p> <p>The code of practice has been drawn up by the five British mobile networks in conjunction with the Home Office, police and children's charities. It also allows firms to sell services based on data that locates the position of a mobile user.</p> <p>Several firms are planning to offer services which parents can use to find out whether their children are at school or out with their friends.</p> <p>\"This is a revolutionary step change,\" said John Carr, of the children and technology unit at the charity NCH. \"The secret service and police have had access to this data for years but never before has the mass market had the ability to locate a handset.\"</p> <p>Under the guidelines unveiled yesterday, the phone being traced receives regular text messages reminding the user that he or she can be tracked.</p> <p>Unlike a similar scheme in Finland where children under the age of 14 have no right to cancel the service, British children will be able to opt out of being located by their parents. The service also stops working if the handset is switched off.</p> <p>Mr Carr stressed that he did not want to see parents using the services as a replacement for talking to their children.</p> <p>\"The point about this service is that for it to work properly the phone has to be on and if it is on and you're worried about where your child is why not call them?\" he said.</p> <p>The guidelines, which have taken over a year to draw up, govern the way in which companies can use the information that the mobile operators have to collect in order to place calls. They set down the information, such as home address and credit card details, that parents must disclose in order track a child's phone.</p> <p>Police chiefs, however, are adamant that they do not want anyone marketing a new location-based service by playing on parental fears about the possibility of their children being abducted. Already one police force has reprimanded a firm that was looking to market a service along these lines.</p> <p>\"Children are subject to the same dangers whether or not they are using a location service,\" according to Stuart Hyde, of the Association of Chief Police Officers. \"We will oppose any organisation that uses marketing in such a way as to increase public fears. Cases of abduction are extremely rare.\"</p> <p>The guidelines cover data about a phone's location which can be calculated by detecting how far it is from the nearest phone mast.</p> <p>Several companies offer location-based services to parents using this data, but the guidelines will produce an industry standard across all the networks.</p> <p>MapAmobile, available to parents through high street retailer Carphone Warehouse, has thousands of users. But Niki Torrance, the company's marketing manager, stressed that the technology will not provide a pinpoint location. \"In a city where there is quite a density of masts it is possible to get a location down to about 50m, although 100m to 200m is more likely. In rural areas, however, it could be 1 or 2km.\"</p>",
  "<p>We live, literally, off the fat of the land. We've never had it so good. Life has never been so easy. And it's killing us. We used to die of disease. In 2020 we will die of life - or more specifically, of the way we live. Modern life is storing up trouble for us. Our health is paying for our convenience. </p> <p>Do you want to know how bad it could be? \"Should the gloomier scenarios relating to obesity turn out to be true, the sight of amputees will become much more familiar in the streets of Britain. There will be many more blind people. There will be huge demand for kidney dialysis. The positive trends of recent decades in combating heart disease, partly the consequence of the decline in smoking, will be reversed. Indeed, this will be the first generation where children die before their parents as a consequence of childhood obesity.\"</p> <p>That comes not from the Daily Mail, but from the House of Commons' health select committee, which issued its report on obesity in May.</p> <p>It all seemed to be going so well in the late 20th century. Life expectancy has been steadily increasing. Medicine has conquered diseases such as pneumonia, typhus and cholera, which used to kill young as well as old. But the truth is that many of us will not enjoy healthy, long life. We will be burdened for years by chronic, debilitating illnesses brought on by our lifestyle, which will also be cause our death. Men born in 2001, who will be 19 in 2020, can expect to live to 76, but will be healthy only until 67. Women will live to 81, but healthy life expectancy is 69 years. That gap between the end of good health and the end of life is increasing.</p> <p>How do we live in 2004? We live fast. Our food is fast. Our communications are fast, by phone and internet, allowing us to work fast without leaving our desks. Our supermarkets allow us a one-stop fast shop, which we load into our car and drive home quickly. Most of the effort we make and will continue to make involves pressing keys and pushing buttons, not digging, hewing or heaving as we did just a few decades ago.</p> <p>Today's children are the NHS chronic disease patients of the future because of the way we live: the boy who goes into a burger bar for breakfast before school, the girl who is driven from door to door because her parents are afraid she will be knocked down by a car while crossing the road. They eat crisps at break and a chocolate bar at lunch. She sneaks a cigarette with friends behind the bike shed. They go home after school and play on the computer for two hours or watch cartoons while snacking on biscuits and more crisps. Dinner is a microwave meal.</p> <p>This big-food, little-effort lifestyle is a recipe for obesity, with its attendant risks of heart disease and diabetes. Obesity links directly into diabetes - a chronic condition that takes two forms. Type one can set in young for genetic reasons and require lifelong insulin, while type two can develop later in life, usually because of weight problems. There can be distressing complications, involving blindness, kidney problems and foot amputation. Our lifestyles also put us at risk of stroke and cancers, a risk exacerbated if we smoke, as girls and young women are doing in increasing numbers. Heart disease and strokes are the leading causes of death in the UK today, accounting for 39% of fatalities, followed by cancers at 26% and respiratory disease at 13%, according to the Office for National Statistics. </p> <p>In all regions of the world except Africa, where HIV is wreaking such devastation, these chronic non-communicable diseases are the biggest killers, says Robert Beaglehole, the director of chronic diseases prevention and health promotion at the World Health Organisation. \"The situation in 2020 will remain the same, even if we get serious,\" he predicts. </p> <p>We know what to do to fight the problem, he says, but we're not doing enough of it. \"Obesity is one risk factor for these conditions. The most important and the most preventable one is tobacco smoking. We have known about the deleterious effects for 50 years.\"</p> <p>We have made an effort with tobacco control in the UK and smoking rates are going down. Lung disease and the cancers and heart disease and strokes associated with cigarettes should also decline, but the improvements are much more marked among the best educated, most affluent groups in the country, who find it easiest to quit. \"For a single mother living under terrible conditions on benefit, smoking might be her only succour,\" says Beaglehole.</p> <p>And so with diet. Obesity is more prevalent in poorer parts of the country. Junk food is cheap and filling. \"The availability of fruit and vegetables is socially patterned,\" says Beaglehole. \"If you go to a poorer neighbourhood, the supermarkets will have a different approach to what they are flogging. There might even be some price differentials. Hence the important role of governments in setting the environment. The government has a fundamental obligation to protect the health of its population. You can call it a nanny state if you like. I would say it is setting the conditions which allow individuals to make healthy choices.\"</p> <p>But first recognise your enemy. In 2004, it appears that obesity has crept up on us almost without our noticing. Our lives have been transformed over just a few decades - an extraordinary pace in evolutionary terms - and the consequences have taken until now to be realised. But according to Weight Concern, a charity that is trialling programmes to help overweight families, the perceptions of many of us have also altered so we do not recognise obesity when we see it, because in some parts of the UK it is all-pervasive. Jude Cohen, the charity's executive director, says it has had angry calls from parents or grandparents who have calculated a child's body mass index (BMI - a formula based on height and weight) on the website and refused to believe there is a problem. \"They are really upset. They say, 'According to your website my grandson is obese but he's not - he's just chunky.' It is more likely the child goes to a school where so many children are obese or overweight that they are beginning to think that what their child looks like is normal.\"</p> <p>Jane Wardle, a professor of psychology who works in the Cancer Research UK health behaviour unit at University College London, and who also works with Weight Concern, thinks the prognosis for 2020 is bleak. \"Nothing yet suggests this inexorable rise is going to plateau, because we're running a few years behind the US,\" she says. The situation across the Atlantic is even worse. Will obesity-related diseases increase in the UK as well? \"I'd say that will happen and they will be coming on progressively earlier in people's lives.\"</p> <p>We can try to modify our culture, she says. \"There's quite a strong political will to do this, motivated by the potential health costs, but not a very strong public will at the moment except in relation to children.\" </p> <p>The problem is that the changes we would have to make would unpick the advances of the convenience society. Do we want to have to walk further than the fridge, take hours instead of minutes preparing food, eat less and cut out the high-fat tastes we have come to like? \"I think it is going to be quite difficult to make changes in the world because the things that have caused obesity are more convenient homes and workplaces. We have designed physical activity out of modern life and it is difficult to design routine physical activity back in. We have designed convenience into our food supply,\" she said. </p> <p>The alternative, she suggests, is to help people to take deliberate physical exercise and limit themselves in the face of food temptation, so they say: \"I'd like this but I won't have it; I'd like more but I won't have it; I'd like it now but I'll have it this evening.\"</p> <p>But that route depends on a cultural shift. She notes the numbers of young girls in cropped tops, showing off rolls of fat around their middles in a way that used to be unusual. She wonders whether a concern about anorexia has gone too far the other way. Parents, and she includes herself, she says, have become worried about suggesting to their daughters any other relationship to food than a free-for-all. \"A spectre has hung over us and while we weren't looking, the world changed,\" she says. </p> <p>Professor Sir Charles George, the medical director of the British Heart Foundation, is not so pessimistic as the MPs of the health select committee. Although overeating and lack of exercise will push heart disease rates up, he thinks we can stave off the worst of the problems with medical interventions, such as widespread use of the class of drugs called statins, even if we face an uphill struggle convincing people to change their lifestyles. \"We will have more and more people over the age of 65 and a still greater proportion over the age of 75. But we're going to see postponement of coronary heart disease events by quite a long period. There's going to be a still further decline in death rates in the under-65s and some deferment of those aged 65-74 into a later age,\" he says. Prevention is key, though, he says, whether by better diet and more exercise or through preventive drug treatment. </p> <p>Other chronic diseases that will become more prevalent for the foreseeable future are harder to prevent. Asthma, for instance, has a whole panoply of possible underlying causes and triggers. But it is undoubtedly a disease of our times and our lifestyle: it is possibly associated with diet, possibly with modern hygiene and possibly with the quality of the air we breathe. Nothing looks likely to derail the upward trend in the incidence of asthma.</p> <p>Cancers, too, are linked to our lifestyle in complex ways that are not fully understood. The numbers of cancer cases will continue to rise, although the mortality rates will probably also continue to fall with ever better treatment, as has been the pattern for some years now. Breast cancer is linked to the decline in breast-feeding, as we have fewer children, later in life, and hurry to wean them, but diet may also play a part, as it does in many cancers. Some chemicals in general use are known carcinogens.</p> <p>We can do something to improve our environment and our lifestyle, but we can't do anything about the genes we inherit, and these can play a big part in our health expectancy. However, by 2020 we may choose to stop ourselves passing them on. Fertility clinics can already test and select embryos, created in the laboratory, that carry certain genes, such as the gene for early-onset Alzheimer's disease and for some cancers. These could be replaced in the womb with disease-free embryos. Only a few of the \"problem\" genes can be identified as yet, but within 16 years we may well all have the option to choose our future child's health and \"breed out\" certain genetically determined conditions.</p> <p>But even genetically perfect babies, free of all the disease genes we can identify, can become couch potatoes doomed to a life of medication and chronic disease clinics. We will undoubtedly have a longer life expectancy in 2020, but how good a life may depend on how much we are willing to scrutinise our lifestyle and reform it in the years to come. It may be that life will have to become just that little bit less easy if we are to enjoy it to the full. </p> <p>Sarah Boseley is the Guardian's health editor</p>",
  "<p>Midnight in Dublin on the north side of the river Liffey. Busty Lycra, a drag queen at the Guru club, and her friend Miss Misdemeanour huddle together for warmth as they shift from foot to foot and inhale deeply on their cigarettes. Their elaborate wigs and the white tassels of Miss Misdemeanour's red cowboy jacket flap in the chill wind.</p> <p>Later on stage, Busty asks clubbers for their opinion. \"What do you think of the smoking ban?\" As she turns her microphone in the direction of the audience, there is a loud roar - broadly of approval, but tinged with the occasional boo. \"What do you think? Yes? No? Fuck off?\". She laughs. </p> <p>As the evening wears on, more people head outside for cigarette breaks. They are laughing and joking as they collectively light up and attempt to shield themselves from the cool September air.</p> <p>\"I think it is a lot better, I like the clean air,\" says Laura Eustace, 35, as she takes a drag of her cigarette. \"I must admit when I first heard about it, I was absolutely horrified. But I have never spoken to so many people as I now have outside bars - it has a very sociable aspect to it.\"</p> <p>She says it is nice to go home \"and find that your hair and clothes don't stink of smoke the following day\". </p> <p>Six months after smoking was banned in workplaces (which includes bars and restaurants) Laura reckons there are still places \"out in the country\" where it is being defied. \"There are places in Kerry where people are smoking in pubs,\" she says. \"They just whip out the ashtrays when you get a lock-in. It is not as strict as Dublin. I have not found anywhere round here where you can have a cigarette.\"</p> <p>The Dubliners aired their views of the ban as a group of politicians and health officials from Greater Manchester visited this week on a fact-finding mission; they are hoping to make workplaces in the conurbation - population almost 3 million-smoke-free. If they are successful it will be the first place in England to enforce such a ban. On Thursday the health secretary, John Reid, indicated that the government would take action to tackle smoking in public places as he met campaigners from anti- and pro-smoking groups. He is expected to publish his long-awaited public health white paper next month. </p> <p>\"I have listened to all sides of this debate very carefully,\" he said. \"The balance of both evidence and opinion on this issue is such that the status quo cannot continue.\"</p> <p>In Dublin, the absence of smoke in pubs is startling. Instead of a thick, fuggy swirl hanging in the air, it smells different - the aroma of hearty nursery food and stale beer instead of tobacco. The brightly painted pubs and restaurants around Temple Bar are still busy with people drinking pints of Guinness. </p> <p>\"I have felt much healthier since the ban,\" says a woman who has worked behind a bar for four years. \"I used to get a lot of colds and problems with breathing after I had been at work. Now I don't have to wash my clothes and hair when I get home just to get rid of the smell of smoke.\" </p> <p>The Greater Manchester delegation met the Irish health minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin. He said around 7,000 people had given up smoking since the ban on March 29 - and the government would see the bene fits in reduced healthcare costs. The majority of hospital admissions, he said, were due to smoking-related illnesses. </p> <p>\"The world has not collapsed since the smoking ban,\" he said. \"Irish people continue to drink and go out. People now enjoy eating and drinking in a smoke-free atmosphere. When we visited New York, to find out about the smoking ban for ourselves, I asked if they had any regrets. They said the only regret was they wished they had done it sooner.\" </p> <p>He acknowledged there had been a reduction in tax revenue from tobacco, as fewer people are smoking, but said it would not make a significant difference as they would spend their money on other commodities. </p> <p>This month the drinks company Diageo said the ban had affected sales of Guinness in Ireland - which had fallen by 6%. Its chief executive, Paul Walsh, blamed lifestyle and demographic changes, price competition \"and the initial impact of the smoking ban\". </p> <p>Gallaher, the maker of Benson &amp; Hedges and Mayfair cigarettes, noted that cigarette sales in Ireland in the first five months of the year had fallen by 9%. </p> <p><strong>Sales fall </strong><br> </p> <p>What has been surprising has been how Ireland has wholeheartedly embraced the ban - the Office for Tobacco Control, which enforces it, reports there has been 96% compliance. </p> <p>There has, however, been a minor rebellion. The owners of Fibber Magees in Galway flouted the ban until they were threatened with legal action. Their protest was dismissed as something of a publicity stunt, rather than a serious uprising. </p> <p>Councillor Pat Karney, the head of Smoke Free Greater Manchester, described the delegation's visit as the most important 24 hours in the history of the campaign. </p> <p>\"In Greater Manchester, all workplaces will be going smoke-free as soon as possible,\" he vowed. \"Do not say it can't be done.\" </p> <p>He said the campaign was not about going after smokers, but about creating a healthy, smoke-free environment in the workplace. </p> <p>\"In Greater Manchester we are ahead of nearly every other region in the country - such as Birmingham and Newcastle - and we will move really quickly once the route map is outlined by health secretary John Reid.\" </p> <p>Another delegate, Lord Smith, the leader of the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, said there was no reason Greater Manchester should be any different to Ireland, where the ban has been self-policing. \"Landlords don't want to break the law and nor do members of the public,\" he said. </p> <p>In Ireland, any contravention of the ban can result in a fine of \u20ac3,000 (\u00a32,000.) </p> <p>Danny Byrne, the owner of the Eliza Blues restaurant overlooking the Liffey, is broadly supportive of the ban. But he says if he were a bar owner he would have preferred segregated smoking areas and improved ventilation. \"It was too much to go for a total ban,\" he says. </p> <p>Not everyone is enamoured of the ban. In the Bagel Bar, smokers Julie O'Connor and Carol Conway say they never go to pubs any more. \"We don't mind a ban in a little coffee shop like this,\" Julie says. \"But we don't really go to pubs any more after work. </p> <p>\"Instead, we will go around to friends' houses to have a drink and a smoke. I am surprised that people have taken the smoking ban so well.\" </p> <p>Carol adds: \"My family lives in Northern Ireland and I was back up there at the weekend. I was smoking in the pub more than ever - just because I knew I could. </p> <p>\"Now when you walk into pubs the smell is disgusting. All you can smell are the toilets, the dirt and the musty upholstery.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was when he hit 40 and his children started school in north London that Michael first remembers being impressed by the teachers. It was at a time when the Teacher Training Association was doing its \"you'll always remember a good teacher\" recruitment campaign. </p> <p>Michael recalls having an \"internal voice\" that kept speaking to him. \"And one day it said 'I want to be a teacher' and it was no longer a joke. I can't explain it rationally,\" he admits. \"But I like children and I was engaging more and more with how my own children were learning. </p> <p>\"I suppose it was something to do with positive input, too. Something about getting them young before they reach the criminal courts. I liked the idea of working with children in a less cynical environment than in the legal profession, where the truth sometimes gets obfuscated. </p> <p>\"I was lied to by all kinds of people in the profession, almost on a daily basis. Lying is a bit strong, but it was a case of playing fast and loose with things. I'd go home at the end of the day and then try to explain things to my children and inculcate values about not lying.\" </p> <p>Which is when he listened to his heart and decided to change direction. </p> <p>\"It happened one morning when I woke up. I was doing well as a lawyer and it was a bright sunny day. It was as if my eyes had been opened. I was following my heart.\" </p> <p>Michael recognises similarities between his former and current work spaces. </p> <p>\"In the legal profession you meet a variety of people: clients, lawyers, judges and police. In teaching you meet parents, children and teachers. In both, it's about knowing your audience: you have to be sensitive to a tribunal. You have a sense of that with the children in your classroom.\" </p> <p>Used to standing up in court, he was also unfazed by standing at the whiteboard, the computerised screens that replace blackboards. \"I've got no problem with public speaking or dealing with parents and other adults. When I did my teacher training in Camden I was immersed and inspired.\" </p> <p>He moved south into Sussex to follow his wife's career and now teaches in the Maidenbower Junior School in Crawley. </p> <p>\"It's a new school on a new development and it's very well resourced. There are 550 children and there's a very supportive team.\" </p> <p>He feels at home in the classroom. \"Classrooms are very individual and mine isn't the tidiest. Inkwells are long gone; it's now whiteboards and pens and dust on computers. </p> <p>\"I don't wear a suit any more but I suppose you could say my dress is smart casual. We don't have school dinners - it's all packed lunches - but in the staff room biscuits and cakes are brought in and there's always masses of tea. </p> <p>'That's why I wanted to be a teacher - to find out what goes on in the staff room.\" </p> <p>He says that teaching Year Five has helped him to rediscover the joy of imagining things. \"You have that as a child but you lose it a bit as an adult. Teaching helps you to get back in touch with your imagination.\" Teaching can also be as stressful as law but in a totally different way. He gets up early, leaves school late, then works at home. </p> <p>\"It's hard work but I am as deeply fulfilled as I have ever been. As a lawyer I was running on empty. </p> <p>\"When I got my first pay slip as a teacher I felt proud. It was a blue slip of paper and I remember thinking 'I really earned that and I deserve this money'.\" </p> <p>When asked if he has any regrets about making the change and taking a massive pay cut, his answer is immediate. \"Not for one nanosecond - 40 is an interesting age because you can still change. </p> <p>\"At 50 it would have been harder. At 40 you think about what would really make you happy and I think you need to rediscover perhaps what you were looking for as a kid. As for the money, we are generally more affluent now. How many more needs can we have?\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Teacher Training Agency: <a href=\"http://www.tta.gov.uk\">www.tta.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "Is it possible to combine a free-enterprise economy with the serious pursuit of equality? This is the question that Labour strategists might find hard to avoid as they gather in Brighton searching for a third-term \"big idea\". The traditional Labour answer was always no. The real gulf, it argued, was not between rich and poor, but between \"workers by hand and brain\" and the owners of the means of production. There could be no meaningful progress towards equality while the commanding heights of the economy remained in private hands. <p>New Labour did away with all that. Clause 4 was dropped, while Tony Blair declared it was never a burning ambition \"to make sure that David Beckham earns less money\". But it did not do away with questions about equality. And as the latest report from the Institute for Public Policy Research reveals, in the past two decades the richest 1% has seen its share of total income double from 6.5% to 13%. Finding progressive answers to the stark iniquities of a market economy is surely what a third term should be about. And some powerful solutions can be found in the Labour party's pre-history. </p> <p>In its earlier years, New Labour could avoid talking about strategies for reducing inequality. With the collapse of communism, it was widely agreed that Clause 4 could no longer be defended. Socialised economies had, it seemed, only exchanged one form of inequality for another, at the cost of mounting inefficiency and stagnation. In the 1997 election it was sufficient that Labour possessed a strong leadership and had accepted Mrs Thatcher's destruction of the politics of collectivism and class. The most important thing about Blair's party was that it was not \"old Labour\". In 2001 as well, little was said. A prosperous economy, sound financial management and Tory disarray were enough to secure a landslide victory. </p> <p>This time, Labour may have to be more specific. The problem is not middle England, which has shown little sign of reverting to the Tories, but Labour's other constituencies. Spin, disquiet over Iraq, disgust with Blair's proximity to Bush, panic about asylum seekers, hostility towards Europe and anxiety about public services could lead to support drifting away. Party membership has fallen; activists are demoralised; protest votes have grown; and erstwhile supporters are opting for everything from the Scottish Socialists to Ukip. More ominously, there is a growing number of non-voters. </p> <p>A commitment to the principle of equality is precisely what is needed to re-enthuse Labour's more questioning supporters. New Labour can already claim some achievements. Doggedly, if covertly, it has reduced child poverty, supported controls over the global environment and increased aid. Poorer families have also benefited from the reduction of unemployment, the increase in nursery places, and the minimum wage. But Labour has never been able to take much credit for this laudable record because it refuses to make a connection between the elimination of poverty and a more equal society. </p> <p>Most obviously, Labour is terrified of the E-word because it fears the reaction to higher taxation for the rich. This would be understandable if it were simply a tactical concern. But it seems more basic. For the evidence suggests New Labour agrees with the new right critique that greater equality could only be at the expense of a free-enterprise economy, and that its pursuit would consequently lead back to an ever more entrenched public sector. In short, a return to Old Labour. Therefore, giving up \"socialism\" means abandoning the goal of greater equality as well. </p> <p>This is a fallacy. It is based upon a foreshortening of history, in which the intellectual origins of neo-conservative laissez-faire are dated back to Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, of 1776. Omitted from the story is the fact that Smith's original reputation was that of a progressive whose work provided the foundation of the radical critique of aristocratic monopoly and of the bellicose state that protected it. </p> <p>It also forgets that the first thinkers and activists to build on Smith's work were libertarians of the left. They included people such as the English radical Tom Paine and the French revolutionary Condorcet, both of whom believed growing inequality was not the inevitable price of a free-enterprise economy, but could be remedied by science and \"the social art\". They were the first to propose universal pensions and schooling, death duties and tax-based systems of social insurance as remedies for poverty and ignorance. For them, two obstacles confronted social advance: \"force\" (aristocratic or oligarchic rule and the laws that protected it); and \"fraud\" (unreasoning superstition and prejudice born of ignorance). Unshackled from this legacy of injustice and oppression, capitalism went together in their minds with scientific progress, increasing equality, free trade, feminism, anti-slavery, anti-colonialism and anti-racism. </p> <p>This was not the founding moment of neo-conservatism. That came a few years later at the end of the 18th century with the frightened reaction to the French revolution. In England, loyalists burned Paine's effigy. In France, Condorcet died in prison. In this climate, anti-revolutionaries such as Edmund Burke and Thomas Malthus denied the radical implications of Smith's work, ridiculed Paine and Condorcet and set in motion the long-term association between liberal economics and conservative politics. </p> <p>But an accurate account of this period shows that the pursuit of equality can be conceived in terms quite other than those of socialism. The language of Paine and Condorcet was that of the coming together of commercial society and the modern democratic republic elaborated in the era of American and French revolutions. Greater equality with a minimal state, universal education, moderate redistributive taxation and social security belonged together in a language of reason and citizenship. As little reliance as possible was to be placed upon the state, since it was associated with a legacy of tyranny and corruption. </p> <p>Instead, the inequality and uncertainty constantly generated by a modern exchange economy was to be curtailed by a democratic constitution in which a framework of law was maintained by a combination of voluntary associations and local authorities - in modern terms, mutual associations, friendly societies, cooperatives, elected local boards, ethically oriented companies and trade unions. </p> <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, this new language of citizenship and democratic enlightenment was increasingly pushed aside by opposing extremes: on the one side, laissez-faire individualism and a language of markets; on the other side, socialism and the language of worker and capitalist. </p> <p>In the 21st century, Labour's \"big idea\" might be to start again from the true birthplace of social democracy, the Enlightenment of the 1790s, with its ambition to combine the benefits of individual freedom and commercial society with an ideal of inclusive citizenship and the public good. The needs of the market can be combined with policies fostering greater equality. New Labour needs to rediscover the first way. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Gareth Stedman Jones is professor of political science at Cambridge University and director of the centre for history and economics, King's College.

  "<b>Dear Peter</b> <br> As a lawyer you must be aware of the steady erosion of civil liberties we are witnessing in an increasingly authoritarian Britain. Now the Home Office is considering banning BNP members from the civil service. Surely encouraging public bodies to sack or veto people for their political views can only be yet another nail in the coffin of freedom. The fact that progressives can even contemplate such a move shows just how cavalier we have become about free speech and freedom of political belief. <p>You might say that a ban would only apply to members of an abhorrent party such as the BNP, but on principle we should be robust in arguing for the right of every citizen, every worker, to espouse the political views of his or her choice. Employment discrimination against members of any political party is McCarthyism by any other name dressed in the radical clothes of anti-racism. Giving the green light to any home secretary to ask would-be civil servants, \"Are you or have you ever been ... ?\" will affect all of us. </p> <p>And would you really trust David Blunkett, the most illiberal home secretary of the modern era, with even more power to police people's politics? Isn't that the same David Blunkett whose punitive treatment of asylum seekers and new immigrants can only make the cranks in the BNP full of envy? <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> There is a line to be drawn between the right to freedom of expression as balanced against the need for members of all communities not to experience racism and differential treatment in their everyday lives.</p> <p>The BNP, despite its recent attempts at adopting a cloak of democratic respectability, is an openly racist party that advocates policies that dictate people's rights depending on the colour of their skin. There is an expectation that with the exercise of power comes responsibility, particularly when one considers the exercise of public duties that often impinge on the rights of others.</p> <p>It is not unreasonable to propose that it is unacceptable for the promoters of certain political views to hold public office. I cannot, as a member of this society, expect my son to be taught by a racist or a sexist, or expect my freedom to demonstrate to be curtailed by such people purporting to be police officers or magistrates. </p> <p>I understand that the German constitution prevents Nazis from holding public office. The question should be whether the UK should have a lesser test. History provides some hard lessons of where democracy surrenders too many freedoms in the name of liberty. The BNP should be exposed for what they truly are, and the principle of balancing the rights of all citizens should not be dependent on the views of a rightwing and populist home secretary. <br><b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>Dear Peter</b><br> Your talk of \"drawing and line\" and \"balancing ... rights\" actually means curtailing rights. Rights are not divisible; you cannot have the \"right to free speech unless your speech offends someone\". To qualify rights with conditions makes them gifts of the state, handed out and withdrawn arbitrarily. This is a matter of principle. However much you object to the BNP, that objection must not become the vehicle through which democratic gains are eroded for us all. </p> <p>You ask me to learn the lessons of history. You might remember the House Committee on Un-American Activities grew from a committee established in 1938 aimed at Nazi activity in the US. It became a permanent committee in 1945, and while little came from its investigations of Nazis it came into its own when it dealt with those who supposedly had communist sympathies.</p> <p>Public office-holders should be held to account for their capacity to do their jobs. If their political prejudices mean they actually abuse their power, then of course they should be disciplined. It would be as unacceptable for a housing officer with Christian views to deny housing to an atheist as for a BNP member to discriminate against an Asian. But neither should be denied a job simply because they hold particular views. </p> <p>The example of teaching is pertinent. I used to teach in further education. To many, my views were \"offensive\", especially my espousal of an open-door policy and an end to all immigration controls. As a trade union office-holder, I also led several strikes. None the less I was able to teach English and history as required and my students got good results. Those members of management who suggested my \"certain political views\" were incompatible with my teaching role were wrong, and it is a good thing they did not have the sanction to get rid of me. <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> I am afraid you fail to understand that the European court does not agree with your views as the right to freedom of speech is always balanced with my right not to be offended by what a racist or fascist might say.</p> <p>To suggest that BNP members can legitimately be police officers, judges or teachers appears to miss the point: BNP members' views are so fundamentally opposed to the democratic norms of society that they cannot perform the roles of police officers, judges or teachers without the strong suspicion that they will be inherently biased against the black and minority communities. On a rational basis, what confidence can we expect black and minority Britons to have in democratic institutions if they are supposed to expect equal treatment from card-carrying BNP civil servants?</p> <p>I recently had the pleasure of playing Paul Robeson at the Tricycle theatre in the play entitled Are You Now or Have You Ever Been a Communist? The ideological hysteria against communism is not to be confused with the attempt to restrict the BNP from holding public office. As Robeson said before the Congressional hearings: \"I am not being tried for whether I am a communist; I am being tried for fighting for the rights of my people, who are still second-class citizens in this United States of America.\"</p> <p>The ability of journalists such as Taki, writing in the Spectator, to express race hatred and anti-semitism has to be linked to the thug who then commits the racial murder on the street. Anyone who believes that holders of public office should be card-carrying members of the BNP should spend some time with a victim of race hate crime. Should we carry adverts inviting BNP members into the police force? I think not. <br><b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>Dear Peter</b><br> I am sure you don't seriously expect me to take my lead in political principles from the unelected European court. Free speech is a political right that has to be defended by all of us, not a mere clause in some document dreamed up by bureacrats.</p> <p>I consider the fight for equality and against racism to be an important political focus but I think we are in danger of talking up the significance of the BNP in this context. The rise in votes for the BNP is accompanied by the rise in support for anyone who represents \"none of the above\", from a candidate dressed as a monkey to support for a ragtag of independent candidates. </p> <p>As many commentators have noted, many of those who vote BNP do so not because they are hardcore racists but rather as a way of giving two fingers to mainstream parties. This obsession with Nick Griffin and his nasty little coterie is actually helping transform them into the talking point of British politics. Ironically, it is policy proposals such as this employment ban that help build the BNP into a national political force.</p> <p>I am also worried by the ease with which you conflate speech with action. You move seamlessly from racist rants to racial murder. The distinction between the expression of certain views and the committing of specific acts is a crucial one, a bulwark against the insidious notion of thought crimes. </p> <p>Every section of society, of whatever ethnic origin, has far more to fear from a state that is able to criminalise views it considers unacceptable and treat them on a par with violent actions than any individual Pc Plod in the BNP. <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> You forget to recognise that the European convention is not some bureaucratic nicety interpreted by a few remote figures in Strasbourg. The convention, like the Geneva convention on refugees, has been endorsed by democratic governments and indeed was created from the desire not to have Europe descend into government-led dictatorships of the far right or left. On the one hand, you decry governments as being oppressive, but then denounce the articles of the European convention, which has the task of restraining governments and upholding the rights of individuals.</p> <p>Maybe my ability to link racist rhetoric and the physical attack derives from experiencing the aftermath of verbal abuse. The men, women and children who experience the aftermath of a BNP march and who are prevented from venturing out do not have the luxury of an academic debate with racist members of the BNP or their supporters. As a child growing up in the north-east, there was not a great deal of opportunity for someone who calls you a nigger to engage in the freedom of speech semantics in some cosy debate. </p> <p>Would you take your complaint of racial harassment, sexual assault or homophobia to a BNP police officer or magistrate? I doubt it </p> <p>The suggestion that by leaving the BNP to fester it will simply go away is, I believe, normally called appeasement. Pay a visit to the Holocaust museum in Washington, dwell for a moment in the slavery museum in Liverpool, or walk in the killing fields of Rwanda. Listen and look to the children of all races who are left to wonder what a world we have created. We owe a duty not to engulf them with the same complacency, indifference and laissez-faire attitude that is the hallmark of the oppression of one group by another.</p> <p>At the London Race Hate Forum we are aware of the clear link between the presence and activity of the BNP and the rise in racial violence and tension. An international prosecutors' conference in Stockholm two years ago found a well-organised and international fascist network, of which the BNP was clearly part. Ideas, funding, policies and strategies have been coordinated in Europe and North America for some time. The BNP are not the isolated thugs they may appear to be, and the sinister ability to move to the mainstream, as in Holland or in eastern Germany, should not be brushed aside.</p> <p>As a person likely to be on the receiving end of racism, I would rather see the BNP excluded from public office than wake up one day to say: \"I told you so.\" History rarely awards communities a second chance. At the end of the day you cannot enjoy your freedom at someone else's expense. <br><b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>Dear Peter</b><br> I am not interested in defending the employment rights of BNP members per se any more than I am interested in the free speech of racists to racially abuse others. But once the principles of political freedom and free speech are compromised for those we despise, they are compromised for everyone. </p> <p>I agree about the importance of equal treatment under the law, and that is why I am not complacent about attempts to give legal endorsement to unequal treatment in the workplace. Have you noticed how convenient the BNP bogeyman has become for mainstream politicians who want to claim the moral high ground of anti-racism? </p> <p>No matter how reactionary Howard or Blair are on quotas, holding camps, or discussions about swamping, they never tire of issuing warnings against the extremists in the BNP. This is little more than a phoney moral crusade allowing those who really wield power and make discrimination a reality to dress themselves in the cloak of anti-racist virtue. Finally, do I trust government - local, national, or European - with even more power to finger people as a potential threat to democracy? Let's give the last word to Yusuf Islam (aka Cat Stevens). <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> The freedom to work is an important human right, but you place undue reliance on those holding public office declaring their personal and political bias. It would be naive to suppose individuals within the BNP would not wish to infiltrate public bodies.</p> <p>The issue of Yusuf Islam has little to do with employment rights and is an example of the clear difference between the Islamophobic approach of the US government and the legitimate protests made on his behalf by the Muslim community and the British government.</p> <p>Racial bias is by its very nature often an insidious threat, and in order to produce an inclusive society we need all citizens to have confidence in our democratic institutions. <br> <b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Claire Fox is director of the Institute of Ideas.

  "The government's crisis command unit, Cobra, is monitoring tension levels around Britain to guard against extremists using the plight of the British hostage Ken Bigley as an excuse to attack Muslims. <p>As the hostage crisis entered its ninth day, efforts in Britain and Iraq intensified to secure the release of Mr Bigley, 62, who is being threatened with being beheaded by one of the most ruthless groups in Iraq, led by the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. </p> <p>Cobra, which sits in the Cabinet Office and is made up of ministers, civil servants and law enforcement officials, fears that if the Iraqi extremists carry out their threat, Muslims in Britain could face a backlash. </p> <p>The moderate Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said it had received 2,000 threatening emails, and the Association of Chief Police Officers yesterday gathered information from forces about tension levels and threats in their areas. </p> <p>British Muslims were last night scheduled to fly to Baghdad to plead for Mr Bigley's life, in a mission organised by the MCB. It said the mission was partly designed to show that British Muslims were as appalled by Mr Bigley's plight as anyone, and to reiterate the belief among British Muslims that Islam forbids the taking of civilians as hostages, let alone their killing. </p> <p>In a separate development, the Foreign Office yesterday distributed 50,000 leaflets in the Baghdad suburb where Mr Bigley was captured, appealing for information. </p> <p>The Iraq government confirmed yesterday that six more hostages, Egyptians working for Iraq's biggest mobile phone company, have been seized. A spokesman for the company in Cairo for which the men worked hinted that the kidnapping was criminal rather than politically motivated. </p> <p>As violence continued throughout Iraq yesterday, four Iraqis were killed in a rocket attack in a square in the middle of the capital. </p> <p>On the British Muslim mission to Baghdad were Dr Daud Abdullah, lecturer in Islamic studies at Birbeck College, London, and Musharraf Hussain, from the Karimia Islamic education institute in Nottingham. </p> <p>They are hoping to meet leading Iraqi Sunni scholars to press them to use their influence to save Mr Bigley's life. </p> <p>Dr Abdullah said: \"We're going there to lend our support to whatever efforts are being made by the scholars. We hope our presence will add credence and weight to whatever efforts are being taken.\" </p> <p>He said his pleas would have weight and credibility because the MCB opposed the invasion of Iraq. Hours before flying out, Dr Abdullah said he blamed the hostage crisis on Mr Blair's decision to go to war: \"We are now called upon to clean up the mess made by our government and its partners in the coalition.\" </p> <p>Sources say the MCB suggested the idea of a British Muslim delegation three days ago, but the Foreign Office only gave the go-ahead yesterday. </p> <p>A spokesman for the council, Inayat Bunglawala said: \"It may lessen any backlash if our people go out there. This is about showing that Muslims are just as appalled by this barbarity as anyone else.\" </p> <p>The police have drawn up contingency plans on how to protect Muslims if the worst happens to Mr Bigley. A source with close knowledge of their efforts said: \"Our anxiety is that there will be some who seek to exploit it. We have to be prepared for anything from fighting in the streets, to low-level incidents such as graffiti.\" </p> <p>Muslims met for Friday prayers at the Ar Rahma mosque in Toxteth, Liverpool, yesterday, where they dedicated part of their prayers to Mr Bigley and his family. Last night more prayers were said at a multi-faith candlelight vigil at the Anglican cathedral in the city. </p> <p>Mr Bigley's mother, Lil, 86, was released from hospital yesterday after falling ill following a live television appeal on Thursday evening.</p>",
  "<p>The cast of characters when Wigan play St Helens tonight in the latest, sudden-death instalment of British rugby league's oldest rivalry will be almost unchanged from their last high-profile meeting, in the Challenge Cup final at the Millennium Stadium in May. </p> <p>Sean Long will be there, perhaps with a slightly different arrangement of his blond locks, aiming to repeat the man-of-the-match performance he produced in Cardiff, having returned only last week from the three-month betting suspension imposed shortly after the cup final. </p> <p>Wigan will again be led by Andy Farrell, albeit in a new position - prop, where he has made such a success of a switch enforced by a series of injuries to the club's specialist front-rowers - and with a slightly reshaped nose, the legacy of a bloody home battle against Leeds. </p> <p>It is only in the Wigan dugout - or more accurately, the top of the JJB Stadium stand, where coaches choose to sit these days - where there will be a significant change in personnel. </p> <p>The cup final was Mike Gregory's last game in charge of Wigan before he flew to Texas for treatment on the neurological illness which had cast a shadow over the club's build-up to the big day. Since then his former assistant Denis Betts has taken over, although the fact that there has been no change in his official job title - as assistant coach filling in for Gregory on a temporary basis - underlines the unique difficulties he has faced. </p> <p>Betts, who turned 35 last week, admits the Wigan post, his dream job, dropped into his lap far more quickly than he expected. But as a close friend, as well as colleague, of Gregory's, it has done so in harrowing circumstances. </p> <p>\"We're just waiting, hoping and praying for Mike,\" he reflected this week. \"First and foremost you just want him to get well, to be right, without talking about the job. The priority is Mike Gregory.\" </p> <p>But since the cup final, Wigan have had to become Betts's priority, and finishing fourth above Saints to secure home advantage tonight has been a worthy achievement. \"I wouldn't say it's been a learning curve, more of a learning climb, and a bit of a scramble at times,\" he admits. \"But I've got a lot of belief in myself and the players in the team. Farrell, [Adrian] Lam, [Craig] Smith, [Kris] Radlinski - it's not like you're trying to teach them how to suck eggs. </p> <p>\"What gets lost is that my importance is minimal. I'm there to guide and to push, but the most important people are the ones who take the field. It's their body that hurts, it's their head that's sore.\" </p> <p>As that indicates, one aspect of the unexpected promotion that was never going to worry Betts was the higher media profile. \"Throughout my career I've always liked a chat,\" he agreed. \"I wouldn't say I've been gobby, but I've liked a chat. I was al ways that kind of kid, I had no problem standing up in front of people and talking - I think it comes from my parents.\" </p> <p>Betts had a good story to tell from the start of his distinguished playing career, as a talented all-round sportsman from Salford who had trials with Manchester United before signing for Wigan. He was a second-row mainstay in all but the first of their eight consecutive Wembley wins from 1988 to 1995, taking the Lance Todd Trophy as man of the match against St Helens in 1991, and named British rugby league's Man of Steel in 1995 before joining the Auckland Warriors for their debut season. </p> <p>Things did not work out so well for him in New Zealand, with the size of his salary at the height of the Super League war becoming a matter for national debate, although he was an outstanding vice-captain to Farrell in winning the last three of his 30 Great Britain caps on tour in his adopted country in 1996. </p> <p>In 1998 he returned to Wigan's pack, sharing in their dour victory over Leeds in Super League's first grand final, but three years later his playing career reached an abrupt and unsatisfactory end in a record Old Trafford defeat by Bradford. </p> <p>\"I never expected that to be it, and in some ways I still regret not keeping my boots on for longer,\" he says. \"But an opportunity arose for me in coaching, and the people I spoke to saw it as the start of something. I set down a plan, I wanted to be a Super League coach within five years of retiring from playing. This is my third year since retiring, and I've already been a year and a half coaching a Super League side. So it's been a bit of a baptism of fire. </p> <p>\"To be in charge of the greatest club in the world of rugby league - I sometimes have to pinch myself.\" </p> <p>But remembering how he came to be in charge acts as Betts's reality check. \"You can talk about Super League grand finals, Wigan against Saints, and obviously it's a massive match for all of us,\" he said. \"But the most important person is Mike Gregory. That puts everything in perspective.\" </p> <p><strong> TV: Sky Sports 1, ko 6.05pm</strong><br></p>",
  "<p>Ian Millward has sprung plenty of surprises in his five seasons as the coach of St Helens, but if Jamie Lyon plays in tonight's elimination play-off at Wigan he will have surpassed himself. </p> <p>Lyon is not due to join Saints until next season but Millward played along this week with rumours that the young Kangaroo centre has already been registered with the Rugby Football League, fuelling speculation that he could make a shock debut at the JJB Stadium. </p> <p>But that would be news to Lyon's uncle, who also acts as his agent. He had not heard from his nephew by Thursday but guessed that he would be \"somewhere on the piss in Wee Waa\" - the outback town where he has been playing this year - after spending last week pig shooting in the bush with Hull's new signing Nathan Blacklock. </p> <p>Still, Millward's wind-up gave Wigan something extra to ponder for a few days, just as he has been left to wonder whether Terry Newton might make a surprise return for the Warriors. The Great Britain hooker was ruled out for at least a month after dislocating his thumb at London two weeks ago, but the pot came off this week; the sort of situation which always provokes intrigue ahead of a Wigan-Saints derby. </p> <p>Even the venue produced some lighthearted banter, disguising a developing rivalry between Millward and his latest Wigan counterpart Denis Betts at Monday's official play-off launch. Wigan have not lost at the JJB Stadium for over a year and Saints have not beaten them there since 2000, suffering eight consecutive defeats including two in the play-offs. </p> <p>So when Millward said \"We like the place, we'd probably rather play there\" Betts bit back quickly: \"I'd rather be playing at the JJB as well.\" For both the stakes are high, with tonight's winners moving to within two matches of the grand final and the losers bowing out. It should be quite a night.</p>",
  "<p>In a land where the pushbike is king and the banknotes still bear the image of Chairman Mao, formula one opens up its new frontier tomorrow. When the lights go out to signal the start of the first Chinese grand prix, the world's most technologically advanced and capitalistically motivated sport will acquire an additional audience of 1.3 billion people, all of whom have hitherto been denied the opportunity of falling asleep during yet another victory for Michael Schumacher. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, there have already been cultural misunderstandings between the grand prix circus and its new public. \"Do you race in red,\" the world champion was asked soon after his arrival in Shanghai this week, \"because it is lucky?\" </p> <p>Traditionally symbolising strength and good fortune, red has had other meanings in China. Since 1949 it has been so closely identified with the People's Republic that when the Cultural Revolution was in full spate there was a serious proposal to modify Shanghai's traffic lights so that red meant \"go\". </p> <p>This weekend, however, red has suddenly acquired an extra meaning. Images of Schumacher's Ferrari, in Italy's historic racing livery, now adorn billboards and banners lining the boulevards of formula one's latest host city. </p> <p>China's own red flag is flying over the brand-new Shanghai international circuit. A ribbon of tarmac twisted into the approximate shape of a character meaning \"ascension\", built on reclaimed swampland 25 miles outside the city at a cost to the People's Republic of around \u00a3350m, the track symbolises the country's desire to re-engage with the outside world. </p> <p>Sport is being given a significant role as China plays its game of catch-up. An impressive haul of medals in Athens made an ominous prelude to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, where Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams are currently competing in the China Open. Golf is everywhere, and the seven-course Mission Hills golf complex outside Shanghai is said to be the largest of its type in the world. </p> <p>Sometimes the results can seem incongruous. Before yesterday's opening practice sessions at the Shanghai circuit, men in coolie hats were arranging pots of flowers and sweeping dust from the pathways with wooden-handled brooms made from bound twigs. Inside the paddock, clustered in a village of steel and glass bungalows designed with feng shui in mind and surrounded by moats and ornamental gardens, marketing men were working out how to exploit formula one's latest voyage into a brand-new market. </p> <p>To a sport under siege, China's awe-inspiring new racetrack offers a vision of optimism to offset the growing fear, following last week's announcement of the imminent demise of the Jaguar team, that formula one is on the brink of engineering its own collapse. </p> <p>\"What's going on is absolutely stupid,\" Max Mosley, the president of the sport's governing body, said yesterday during a discussion about the inability of the grand prix teams to agree on the measures that would avert potential disaster for some of them. But even those managers, designers and mechanics whose jobs and livelihoods are under threat found their jaws dropping in admiration as they walked through the ornamental wooden gate at the entrance to the Shanghai paddock this week. </p> <p>\"This is a statement to the world that China is arriving and is one of the most modern nations on the planet,\" Tony Purnell, the Jaguar team's beleaguered boss, observed. </p> <p>\"What we see here is absolutely amazing,\" added Eddie Jordan, whose own team is also up for sale. \"These people have set the benchmark.\" </p> <p>That paddock gate, the sort of thing found at the entrance to a more conventional kind of temple, is virtually the only visible acknowledgement of the past. In every other respect the Shanghai circuit, which will become the 63rd to have staged a grand prix since the world championship began in 1950, is a pure product of Playstation culture. Designed, like the new tracks in Malaysia and Bahrain, by the German architect Hermann Tilke, it offers a synthetic racing experience owing little to the sport's hallowed traditions. </p> <p>When a country agrees to pay Bernie Ecclestone \u00a340m a year to stage a round of the championship, a Tilke design becomes an automatic part of the package. Each Tilkedrome offers superb viewing facilities, carefully devised safety precautions, spacious and beautifully equipped pits and hospitality suites, and an almost total absence of individual character. </p> <p>For Shanghai's 3.4-mile circuit, Tilke may have set his sights a little higher than usual. \"It's quite an interesting technical challenge,\" Schumacher said last night after completing the day's practice. \"There are some blind corners that are pretty tricky, and it looks like there might be some chances to overtake.\" </p> <p>The sight of the seven-times world champion helping a marshal to push his broken car back down the pit lane at the end of yesterday's morning session offered the sprinkling of spectators a rare glimpse of the human face of formula one. Once what Schumacher described as \"a software issue\" had been resolved, the No1 Ferrari ran untroubled throughout the afternoon, although its best time was nowhere near those of the BAR-Hondas of Anthony Davidson and Jenson Button, which topped the timing sheets. </p> <p>Jacques Villeneuve, returning to the track at the wheel of the second Renault after an absence of 11 months, was more fulsome in his praise of the circuit. \"It's gorgeous,\" he said. \"There's a bit of everything, with a good mixture of quick and slow corners. It isn't easy, but if you can find a good rhythm it really flows well, which is unusual for a new circuit. In a way it's more like the old tracks.\" </p> <p>That may not be quite so apparent to those watching the race on television. Sitting at home in Europe, admirers of Monaco, Silverstone, Spa and Monza - the venues of this season's most exciting races, all of them more than half a century old - will watch and perhaps weep as the drivers negotiate bends owing very little to natural topography and almost everything to a man with a protractor, a pair of compasses, a drawing board and a set of strict instructions. </p> <p>And, like formula one itself, the track is built on something less than solid ground. Tilke's latest creation is perched on 40,000 concrete pillars sunk to depths of between 25 and 80 metres. Even the deepest of the pillars does not plumb the depths of the old swamp, and to ensure that the track \"floats\" on its supports, a bed of styrofoam lies beneath the upper layers of earth and Tarmac. Nevertheless the track does have its spectacular features, not least the two huge aerofoil-shaped bridges that span the finishing straight, connecting the pits with the vast main grandstand and containing the VIP boxes and the media centre. </p> <p>On the other side of the circuit, a banked turn catapults the cars on to a longer straight, a heat-haze blurring their outlines as they hold a speed of 220mph before braking down to 50mph for a sec ond-gear corner which, according to most of the drivers, offers the best opportunity for an overtaking manoeuvre. It remains to be seen whether the noticeable bumps in the braking zone will contribute to the entertainment, and whether they will worsen with use. </p> <p>Merely to have completed such a huge project on schedule, less than two years after the promoters signed a contract with Ecclestone, indicates the seriousness of China's approach at all levels. Playing a game of catch-up with the developed world before fulfilling its threat to become the dominant economic power of the 21st century, the People's Republic is encouraging inward investment and offers huge opportunities to the major manufacturers who supply and fund the top teams. </p> <p>Only one in 15 Chinese currently owns a car, but the proportion is growing fast across all sectors of the market. BMW, which already manufactures its range of mid-sized cars in China, will soon be followed by Mercedes-Benz, whose sporting director, Norbert Haug, described this weekend's event as \"potentially the most noticed event in motor sport history\". And yesterday Ferrari, which sells 80 cars a year here, announced the formation of a new company with two Chinese partners, with the intention of raising the figure to 300. As several of the formula one drivers noted yesterday, most of China's car-driving population appear to reside in Shanghai, where the roads are clogged with saloons, buses and trucks driven by people whose anarchic notion of lane discipline is combined with an urgent desire to reach their destination in the shortest possible time. Expressways are littered with shunted cars and recovery vehicles; urban gridlock appears to be an everyday occurrence. </p> <p>\"People say that the traffic in Brazil is the reason why so many racing drivers come from there,\" Rubens Barrichello said last night. \"If that's true, then China will have a lot of top racing drivers very soon.\" </p> <p>China's champions of the future are already being trained at Shanghai's three kart tracks, and some of them are in the grand prix paddock this weekend. The 20-year-old Franky Cheng Congfu is being groomed by the McLaren-Mercedes team. Tung Ho-Pin, two years older, races in the German formula three championship and has already tested for Williams-BMW. Jiang Tengyi, a Shang hai-born teenager, is racing in Italy and has links with Toyota. So important is China to formula one's future that it would be no surprise to see one of these drivers fast-tracked on to the grand prix grid within two or three years. </p> <p>The speed of China's invasion of world sport matches the pace of change in downtown Shanghai, where ranks of outlandish skyscrapers and the 438m high Oriental Pearl Tower loom over the art deco banks and hotels of the celebrated Bund on the far side of the Huangpu River. Although almost an hour's drive away, the Shanghai circuit was planned with the same adventurous spirit, and all 200,000 tickets are said to have been sold for tomorrow's race, at prices far beyond the reach of the average Chinese citizen. </p> <p>But this is a country where the gap between rich and poor is once again growing fast, driven by an unchained desire among the emerging middle class for the products of McDonald's, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Rolex and BMW. Maybe, as some financial analysts believe, this is all part of a new power struggle in which China is using the west's weapons against itself, deploying its economic power to shore up the US dollar and attracting western manufacturers to open factories until the point at which it can pull the plug, jettison its dollar holdings and bring the old enemy crashing down. </p> <p>Meanwhile the teenagers of Shanghai want to look like Posh and Becks, and the return of consumer power is also symbolised by the billboards for Bridgestone tyres on the Shanghai-Nanjing expressway and the Coca-Cola parasols lining the approaches to the circuit. To gaze on these things and to recognise the vastness of the market they represent is to acknowledge the accuracy of Ecclestone's vehemently expressed view that the future belongs here. </p> <p>This, finally, is where history goes out of the window. Memories of the past - theirs and ours - have no place at the Shanghai international circuit. Mao and Moss are equally irrelevant to what will happen here tomorrow. Old values are not going to make a comeback. Although the Chinese grand prix is only a motor race, it demonstrates the extent to which new forces are in control now, their interests temporarily coinciding even if their motives are far apart. </p> <p>So once again, in the words of the Maoist slogan, the east is red. But now red really does mean \"go\".</p>",
  "<p>Wandering through the sitting room last weekend, my eight-year-old daughter paused in front of the Ryder Cup coverage for a moment and then asked, \"What are the crowd saying?\" I explained to her that the patriotic folks at Oakland Hills were chanting \"USA, USA\". </p> <p>\"Oh,\" she said, \"I thought they were shouting 'Feed my face! Feed my face!'.\" </p> <p>Somehow I can't help feeling that this charming yarn illustrates more than merely the need to add Waxol and Q-Tips to our shopping list. </p> <p>At Brussels airport a few years ago I saw a large man in a T-shirt bearing the slogan \"I support two teams: New Zealand and Whoever's Playing Australia\". From the comments I've heard over the summer it seems a majority of people in Britain take a similar \"anybody-but\" view when it comes to the United States. The mood of anti-Americanism is so palpable that even primary school kids have subliminally absorbed it. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly given the prevailing mood, Europe's victory in Michigan has been warmly celebrated. But for those of us of a less prejudiced mindset, the defeat of the US was a source not of joy but of deep regret. Because to anyone with a spark of creativity, it is plain the Americans deserved to win, if only for their imaginative choice of team captain. </p> <p>The lateral thinking that had been applied across the Atlantic didn't become obvious until the photograph of the skipper in question appeared in this newspaper on the opening morning. The caption erroneously identified him as Hal Sutton, but with that Stetson hat perched above a head so big and solid you could beat horseshoes on it, and that meaty face contorted into a wounded yet determined expression that called to mind Deputy Dawg trying to free his foot from a mangle, there was no mistaking who it really was. </p> <p>Whereas Europe had taken the stolid, conservative decision to appoint a top golfer, Bernhard Langer, to lead the side, the Yanks had gone radical and given the job to Hoss from Bonanza. </p> <p>The genial Hoss has no golfing background whatsoever, but the Americans were clearly hoping that the TV cowboy's wealth of experience in everything from cattle-driving to bank robbing to professional rabbit-breeding (and breeding a professional rabbit is no easy task let me tell you, all members of the family Leporidae tending naturally towards flamboyant amateurism) would do just as well. </p> <p>Those of us who have campaigned in the past for the Football Association to appoint the silver-haired country and western giant turned fried-chicken restaurant magnate Kenny Rogers as manager of England's football team could not fail to be impressed. </p> <p>Sadly things did not work out for the beefy, big-hearted lunk from Nevada and in the States Hoss has come in for a good deal of unwarranted criticism over his handling of the US team. With the benefit of hindsight many have argued that he should never have been given the job in the first place. \"If the US PGA was determined to appoint someone from the Ponderosa Ranch to head up our Ryder Cup challenge,\" wrote Hoosier Van Moustache of Pacific North-West Golf Illustrated Monthly, \"then it is clear that Ben Cartwright was the only one for the job. After all, he runs the damn ranch.\" </p> <p>Dick Loudshirt of Orange County Bunker World Quarterly concurred, adding: \"And if Ben was unavailable due to his commitments to standing on the porch at dusk with a cup of coffee in his hand grieving for his three dead wives, then surely eldest son Adam was next in line?\" </p> <p>Zane E Braces of New England Classic Iron noted: \"OK, so Hoss can rescue Little Joe when his younger brother has had his first slug of redeye then wandered into a bordello after mistaking it for a candy store, but what in tarnation's use is that when it comes to helping Phil Mickelson focus?\" </p> <p>Other writers claimed that the US management had not only got the wrong man but the wrong television series. \"If the guys in charge were looking for somebody from a 1960s ranch-related western, then you'd get no arguments from your average Joe that the cattleman they needed was Big John Cannon of the High Chaparral,\" commented Stingy Brimhat of Lone Star Practical Wood, </p> <p>\"After all, the Arizonan took the disparate talents of brawling, drunk Uncle Buck, hot-headed Mexican gunslinger Manolito, ornery half-breed Wind and wet-eyed doofus Billy Blue and welded them into the kind of formidable outfit that could weather tornadoes and Apache raids, never mind the challenge of some fat Scotch guy and an elderly Spaniard who looks like he once played bass in Weather Report.\" </p> <p>Gravy Cravat of the New York-based Vanity Fairway went still further: \"With Mr Magoo-esque myopia, the US PGA not only got the wrong character from the wrong ranch, they also got the wrong era and the wrong genre,\" he wrote. </p> <p>\"If there was anyone capable of genuinely motivating Tiger Woods with something less tangible than big bucks, then surely Tony Soprano is that man?\"</p>",
  "<p>A year ago, Roy Jones was rated the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world and arguably one of the outstanding boxers of recent decades. </p> <p>Some suggested he had earned the right to be mentioned in the same bracket as Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler and, perhaps, even the great Sugar Ray Robinson. </p> <p>But two match-ups with the southpaw Antonio Tarver - the first of which Jones won last November by a contentious points decision, before Tarver prevailed in the return in May with a shattering second-round knockout to take Jones's championship belts - have left Jones fighting for his credibility in Memphis tonight when he challenges Glen Johnson for the International Boxing Federation version of the world light-heavyweight title. </p> <p>Jones's brilliance was always built around reflexes which helped him score wonderful victories a decade ago over James Toney and Bernard Hopkins. </p> <p>His only other defeat in 51 fights was a disqualification against Montell Griffin, subsequently brutally avenged, and his dominance was such that Jones seemed untouchable - even when he audaciously stepped up to heavyweight to outclass the then World Boxing Association champion, John Ruiz, in March 2003. </p> <p>But there was evidence in the first Tarver fight that Jones was slowing up, and who knows how much might have been taken out of him by the knockout loss in his last contest? </p> <p>At 35, Jones may be in a rapid and irreversible decline. Johnson, also 35, is a game if predictable journeyman who will be earning the biggest pay cheque of his career against Jones, of around $1m (\u00a3550,000), and earned his chance by defeating Sheffield's Clinton Woods in February. </p> <p>Woods was outclassed by Jones in a world title fight two years ago, when he was stopped in six rounds, while he twice went the distance against Johnson. </p> <p>But the Sheffielder said: \"Johnson has a decent chance. Jones's last fight could mean he's on the downward spiral. Johnson's got good workrate, he keeps coming at you, and this may give Jones problems. Johnson definitely hits harder with head shots.\" </p> <p>The Jamaican-born Johnson has been on a wrong end of several judging decisions and has been one of the sport's unfashionable figures. But he is a likeable and honest professional who will have huge motivation to succeed. </p> <p>The Jones of old would have been expected to outbox Johnson and carve out a big points win, but Tarver showed Jones is, at best, on the slide and, at worst, possibly a \"shot\" fighter. If so, the unsung Johnson could give the old superstar all the problems he can handle. </p> <p>Howard Eastman's European middleweight title defence against the Spaniard Jorge Sendra, scheduled for Nottingham Arena, had to be called off last night because Sendra (whose ring nickname is \"Savage\") was unable to provide the MRI brain scan which the British Boxing Board of Control insists is presented by all those fighters due to box in this country.</p>",
  "<p>Sven-Goran Eriksson received a twin dose of good news yesterday, with Sol Campbell and Wayne Rooney on course to be available for England's World Cup qualifiers at home to Wales and away to Azerbaijan next month. </p> <p>Campbell is expected to play his first game of the season today when Arsenal visit Manchester City. The central defender has recovered from an achilles problem and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger also plans to use him in at least one of next week's two matches, at Rosenborg on Wednesday and against Charlton next Saturday. </p> <p>\"I believe if he plays two out of three games in the next week he will be available for England,\" Arsenal's manager said. \"I feel he should be OK because he's worked very hard. If he has no reaction after the games he should be capable of being fit for selection.\" </p> <p>Wenger noted not just Campbell's value to Arsenal because of his power, pace and organisational skills, but also the 30-year-old's importance to the national team. For his part, like Eriksson, Wenger feels a pairing of Campbell and Rio Ferdinand, who returned for Manchester United on Monday, is England's best. </p> <p>Of Campbell, Wenger said: \"In the World Cup and European Championship, Sol was outstanding. When he is committed to something he is really a gladiator. He dies for the cause.\" </p> <p>The bulletins for Eriksson were not all encouraging, especially the news that Michael Owen has a leg strain, forcing him out of Real Madrid's squad to play Athletic Bilbao this weekend. Although Real described Owen's problem as minor, his lack of competitive action is a risk to his match sharpness. The striker played just 10 minutes as a substitute in midweek after making his only Real start, before being replaced on the hour, last Saturday. </p> <p>In midfield, Eriksson has definitely lost Kieron Dyer for both games with a hamstring strain that will keep the Newcastle player out for up to four weeks. </p> <p>This compounds the loss of the latest metatarsal victim, Steven Gerrard, whom Eriksson signalled yesterday would be replaced by Dyer's club-mate Nicky Butt. \"He could be a very important player for us in these games,\" said England's manager of the October 9 date with Wales at Old Trafford and the visit to Azerbaijan the following Wednesday. </p> <p>The concern over Owen makes Rooney's availability all the more important. Sir Alex Ferguson has ruled the \u00a327m striker out of today's game at Tottenham but confirmed that the teenager will almost certainly be involved in the Champions League meeting with Fenerbahce on Tuesday. </p> <p>Rooney, who suffered his metatarsal injury at Euro 2004, has come through a week of full contact training. Playing some part in midweek, and a possible full debut against Middlesbrough a week tomorrow, when Eriksson names his squad, should present Rooney with two meaningful outings just in time. </p> <p>Ferguson said: \"We're trying to learn everything we can about the boy. He's still only 18 and that is different from someone who is 25. At that age, players are still growing and there is every reason to suggest that Wayne is still growing. </p> <p>\"Sometimes with young players their bones are not fully matured and that's maybe why his metatarsal went, you never know. He's been great since he joined. He's shown great enthusiasm in his training.\" </p> <p>Eriksson said: \"With Wayne Rooney, it is also positive that he is progressing. He is a very interesting player for us and, for sure, I will be watching how he does before I name my squad.\" </p> <p>England's manager was also encouraged by the good progress made this week by Gary Neville, out since suffering a knee injury against Poland earlier this month. </p> <p>\"At the moment it looks positive for us,\" Eriksson added. \"If all these players can come back, we will have very many options and I will have the kind of dilemmas that every manager should want.\" </p> <p>Today Eriksson will check Tottenham's trio of England internationals, as well as Ferdinand, at White Hart Lane.</p>",
  "<p>Brian Clough's players were not inclined to punch opponents or mob referees. True, his brief stewardship at Leeds United did see Billy Bremner sent off, along with Liverpool's Kevin Keegan, after the pair had scrapped during the Football Association's first showpiece Charity Shield match at Wembley in 1974, but that Leeds team was never really Clough's to command. </p> <p>When he was manager at Derby County and Nottingham Forest he did not criticise referees in public. The players took their cue from the manager and though both County and Forest contained some hard nuts it was unusual for any of them to crack to brawling point. </p> <p>Clough might cuff invading fans or frogmarch clowns off the pitch but he expected his players to show restraint. Unconventional and scornful of football's hierarchy though he was, he had enormous respect for the game itself and this was reflected in the conduct of his teams. </p> <p>It is difficult to imagine any of them behaving the way Fulham did at The Hawthorns a week ago when they not only had two players sent off, along with one from West Bromwich Albion, but throughout the game harangued the referee Mike Dean in a manner which recalled the anarchic days of the late 60s and early 70s. </p> <p>It was surely no coincidence that Fulham's persistent browbeating of Dean came a week after Mark Halsey had changed his mind about awarding them a penalty against Arsenal and later admitted that his decison had been influenced by the reaction of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side. </p> <p>Halsey's subsequent disallowing of what appeared to be a perfectly good Fulham goal, after which the champions scored three times, prompted the losing manager Chris Coleman to claim that officials were favouring the big clubs. If his players were trying to put this to the test against West Bromwich, when they hotly disputed a penalty awarded against them for handball (it was missed anyway), they merely dug an even bigger hole for themselves. </p> <p>Fulham have since been charged by the FA with failing to control their players; to be precise \"failing to ensure that their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and refrained from violent and/or threatening and/or provocative behaviour\". If found guilty they could be fined up to \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>Andy Cole and Albion's Neil Clement, who scrapped after Clement had been dismissed for a professional trip on Luis Boa Morte, have each been charged with violent conduct. Pape Bouba Diop, who clashed with Darren Purse, was also sent off and allegedly failed to leave the technical area. </p> <p>Cole faces an additional charge of abusing officials, and Coleman's earlier comments have caused his name to be added to the sheet. The cases come up on Wednesday week. </p> <p>All this follows an otherwise unremarkable if entertaining 1-1 draw between teams whose indifferent starts to the season demanded that they keep both sheets and noses clean. Yet neither club has a history of ill-discipline and neither Coleman nor Albion's Gary Megson is apt to confuse commitment with loss of control. </p> <p>It could be argued that the charge of failing to control players can be fairly levelled at a club only if its team has a consistently bad behaviour record over a long period or makes a habit of donnybrooks, neither of which applies to Fulham. </p> <p>Both, however, have applied to Arsenal. In 1989 and 1990, when George Graham was manager, Arsenal were involved in mass brawls first wth Norwich City at Highbury and then with Manchester United at Old Trafford. The latter led to their being deducted two league points but did not stop them winning the championship. </p> <p>A year ago, as the number of red cards under Wenger soared beyond 50, there was another bust-up at United when Arsenal players, believing that overreaction by Ruud van Nistelrooy had helped get Patrick Vieira sent off, rounded on the Dutchman at the final whistle, continuing the confrontation in the tunnel. </p> <p>Subsequently the FA charged six Arsenal players (plus two from United) with misconduct, leaving Highbury to face the prospect of losing more than half the side for a total, between them, of 19 matches. Wenger himself did not help the situation, for although he apologised for what he regarded as overreaction by his team he felt the incident had been exaggerated. </p> <p>Three weeks later, however, Arsenal admitted all charges and got off relatively lightly with Lauren banned for four games, Martin Keown for three and Vieira and Ray Parlour one apiece, plus fines all round. </p> <p>Fulham, though prepared to fight some of the charges facing them, have said they will fine Cole and Diop heavily, which flies in the face of Coleman's assertion after the West Bromwich match that he would not be disciplining his players. Perhaps Fulham, like Arsenal last season, felt the need to get some mitigation in first. </p> <p>Either way the FA now has to maintain discipline and uphold the authority of the referee while keeping a sense of proportion about what happened at The Hawthorns. It was ugly, certainly, but Fulham are not hardened criminals even if they did have Leroy Rosenior sent off in the Carling Cup this week.</p>"
