  "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso had thought he would be presenting a dream team to the European parliament today. Instead he is embroiled in a nightmare row over politics and morality in a power struggle that has injected rare passion and drama into an EU debate - and might, just, end up bringing ordinary people a little closer to the distant institutions that represent them. <p>It was not clear last night whether, or how, the fight over Rocco Buttiglione, Italy's controversial candidate for the Brussels executive - the commissioner-designate for justice and home affairs - can be resolved after a marathon bout of horsetrading in the Strasbourg assembly. If it is not, then many MEPs will be cock-a-hoop. But it will be at the cost of plunging the EU into a grave and unprecedented crisis. </p> <p>In any event, this is the worst start for Barroso, Maoist revolutionary turned centre-right Portuguese prime minister, taking over the presidency from the lacklustre Romano Prodi just as the EU adjusts to the reality of having 25 members and 450 million people - and is about to start years of difficult accession talks with Turkey. </p> <p>On Friday, heads of government gather in Rome for a ceremony to sign the new constitutional treaty. This is designed to make the union function more efficiently and democratically. But with referendums looming in several countries, including Britain, and apathy and Euroscepticism as bad as ever, it may never take effect. And then next week the EU will have to come to terms with the result of the US presidential election, with many leaders rooting privately for John Kerry, and thus risking exaggerated expectations of a man who may speak French and like working with allies, but will probably be unable to deliver a significantly better relationship between the old and new continents. Europe, so often trapped in the gap between aspiration and reality, does not seem poised to play a bigger, more coherent role in the world stage. </p> <p>That global role, though, must begin at home, and Buttiglione is not the only joker in the commission pack: MEPs also raised objections to the Dutch businesswoman appointed to take over the competition portfolio, the Hungarian unsuited to managing energy and the Danish agriculture commissioner married to a farmer enriched by CAP subsidies. </p> <p>None of these candidates generated much interest beyond the Brussels beltway. But the Italian conservative and friend of the Pope has raised hackles because of his views on homosexuality, single mothers and the family - classic beliefs of the conservative Catholic that he is. Feelings ran just as high during negotiations on the EU constitution, with the Italian, Polish and Irish governments - backed by the Vatican - demanding a clear reference to Christian values, but being defeated by the secular-minded majority which decided, correctly, that this would be the wrong message to send to Europe's multicultural societies - with 12 million Muslims, as well as those Turkish wannabes. </p> <p>Buttiglione was justified in arguing that there is a difference between law and morality, and he is entitled to his private views. But he showed a breathtaking lack of judgment in answering MEPs' questions the way he did. The row escalated when his supporters protested about an anti-Catholic \"inquisition\". Yet there is no such inquisition. Joe Borg, the Maltese commission candidate, is a staunch opponent of abortion, but that is irrelevant to his duties running fisheries policy. It is understandable that Barroso did not wish to cede too much ground to parliament. But he was foolish to reject a reshuffle that could have ended this fight quickly and simply. </p> <p>Some of this is the inevitable outcome of the sheer com plexity of the EU's hybrid, Heath Robinson structures. Buttiglione was nominated by Silvio Berlusconi just as Peter Mandelson was by Tony Blair, for similar reasons of domestic politics and the desire to set the policy agenda. The appointed commission president then has to find jobs for these national nominees - who must all pass muster in today's all-or-nothing vote by MEPs. </p> <p>It is a good idea for the European parliament to have a bigger say in the make-up of the union's supranational executive (those \"Brussels bureaucrats\" beloved of British newspapers) and disingenuous to say it should not have one because of poor turnout - a dismal 44% last June - in the European elections. Most people know little about an institution routinely scorned as a talking shop on a gravy train - though some may remember the jaw-dropping gaffe last year when Berlusconi compared a German MEP to a Nazi camp guard. Extraordinary misjudgments and a vicious skirmish over institutional power have come together to create a moment where the stakes for Europe's disenchanted union of states and peoples are suddenly very high. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Ian Black left Brussels this summer after four years as the Guardian's European editor </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ian.black@theguardian.com\">ian.black@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The House of Lords debated hunting, yet again. Or rather, peers discussed the Parliament Act, which the Commons has threatened to use to force through a ban on hunting. <p>Their lordships were not pleased. They thought this was unfair. The fact that the Commons has voted many times for a ban, always by huge majorities, does not strike them as a complete irrelevance, but as a sort of regrettable side issue, which can be resolved by goodwill on all sides. </p> <p>They are mistaken. Yesterday they spent three hours on a possible compromise, a register which would control hunts but allow people to go on hunting. They voted for this wheeze by a whopping majority of 322 to 72. </p> <p>They have a touching, even pathetic, belief that because the government originally proposed this very idea, there is a good chance it will be accepted. </p> <p>They just don't get it. For one thing, the compromise isn't a compromise. You might as well compromise on capital punishment - either you have it or you don't. You can't condemn people to be hanged by the neck until they feel a bit poorly. </p> <p>And anyway, the Commons won't agree to anything that allows people to chase after a furry animal until it is ripped to bits by hounds, whether the huntspersons are registered or not. And the pro-hunt protesters who invaded the Chamber last month will have made things worse for themselves. They instantly turned it into a great issue of democracy v civil disorder. </p> <p>I cannot believe that the Countryside Alliance and their supporters imagine that any MP will say, \"Hmmm, I was all in favour of a ban on hunting until the cradle of democracy was invaded by a bunch of thuggish young men in T-shirts. They certainly changed my mind!\" </p> <p>Lord Donoughue, one of the peers who came up with the compromise, spoke first, his voice as old and creaky as the door into the snug of an ancient coaching inn. He said the government was about to be shamed and humiliated by its actions. </p> <p>He had, he told us, been an adviser to the programmes Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime Minister. \"We would have been happy to have used this as a plot scenario: the government using the Parliament Act to overrule its own proposals. But the writers would have told me, 'We can't use that, it's simply not credible'.\" </p> <p>This is a new one on me, the argument from TV shows. I could do the same; having been adviser to the thriller serial State of Play, I could warn their lordships: \"Never arrange for your mistress to be murdered! They won't even need the Parliament Act to bang you up!\" </p> <p>Poor Lord Whitty, who has the wretched job of piloting the bill through the House, told the peers that \"we are in deep water here\", a remark greeted by angry rumbling, which might not be noticed in the Commons but in the upper house sounded as threatening as Mount Saint Helens before it blew. </p> <p>The arguments grew more recherch\u00e9. Lord Waddington, a former home secretary, accused the government of preaching tolerance on one hand, while letting itself be railroaded by bigots. </p> <p>\"Hitler banned hunting!\" he exclaimed, which may well be true, except that he also painted watercolours and we doubt that will be banned. </p> <p>Norman Tebbit stood up, gaunt and pale, a spectre without a feast. He accused the Commons of being \"the awkward squad\", which is not quite how he put it when he and Margaret Thatcher were making use of their huge majority.</p>",
  "The government is facing a battle with MPs and peers over new rules for employment tribunals which keep whistleblowing claims over corruption, fraud, disregard of public safety and other misdeeds under wraps. <p>Under the little-noticed change in the rules, which came into force on October 1, details of 100,000 employment tribunal claims a year, including those for whistleblowing, are now kept secret from the public. </p> <p>Claims come to light only if and when they go to a tribunal hearing, which is open to all. </p> <p>MPs, peers and the whistleblowers' charity Public Concern at Work point out that only one of three whistleblower claims ever reaches a tribunal hearing - the others are privately settled. </p> <p>They argue that the blanket of secrecy encourages employers with something to hide to buy off a whistleblower with a settlement, preventing valid concerns about safety and corruption reaching the ears of industry regulators. </p> <p>The change to the rules was brought in by the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedures) Regulations 2004. </p> <p>Concerned peers, including Lord Borrie, a former director-general of fair trading, and Lady Dean, a former trade union leader, will call on the government to lift the veil of secrecy in a debate today. </p> <p>They will argue that it will be impossible to monitor how the whistleblowing legislation is working if information about all the claims which are settled without a hearing is kept secret. </p> <p>MPs are due to debate the issue tomorrow in the standing committee on delegated legislation. Richard Shepherd, the Conservative MP who introduced the 1998 Public Interest Disclosure Act, which gives whistleblowers the right to bring tribunal claims for victimisation, said: \"Information about whistleblowing claims was public when the legislation was passed and no organisation has since called for it to be made secret.\" </p> <p>Ministers argue that publicity hinders the conciliation service in trying to settle cases before they reach a hearing. They also claim that publishing details exposes claimants and employers to ambulance chasers, and could lead to the blacklisting of employees with a history of bringing claims.</p>",
  "A specific criminal offence of forcing someone into marriage will be created under proposals to be published today by the Home Office. <p>The announcement is part of a package of measures intended to curb a cultural practice which affects girls as young as 13. </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, is also to introduce immigration rules which will see the minimum age for those coming to Britain to marry raised from 16 to 18 in an attempt to help teenagers resist family pressure to marry without their consent. </p> <p>A Foreign Office community liaison unit, set up in 2000 to tackle the problem, has dealt with more than 1,000 cases in the past three years. </p> <p>The unit has helped to rescue and repatriate about 200 young people who had been brought to Britain mainly from Pakistan and Bangladesh. </p> <p>Ministers will make it clear that the measures are not aimed at curbing arranged marriages. They say that although the families of the two partners often take a leading role in an arranged marriage, the final decision is left to the spouses. </p> <p>A recent government working party found that although the victims of forced marriages can use the law to nullify their partnerships, in practice they rarely know about such provisions or are unable to use them. The law can only be used within the first three years of marriage and family pressure often prevents this. Attempts have been made to use the laws of rape, false imprisonment and kidnapping to deal with the problem. </p> <p>Ministers want to consult on whether a specific offence of forcing someone into marriage will help to deal with the problem.</p>",
  "The Lords last night threw down another hunting gauntlet before the equally implacable Commons when peers voted by 322 to 72 to restore the \"third way\" compromise that would allow hunting with hounds under local licence. <p>During yet another indignant debate on the most disruptive social issue of the current parliament, the junior environment minister, Lord Whitty, faced repeated demands to explain the government's position. </p> <p>Although the bill is a private backbench one, Lord Whitty was asked to confirm if the \"draconian\" Parliament Act would be used to push it through to law. This is what MPs and peers expect, not least because last night's amendment was subtly different from the third-way clause proposed by Alun Michael, the countryside minister, before the Commons voted it down. \"There are loads of loopholes, including deer hunting,\" one anti-hunting Labour peer claimed last night. </p> <p>But both sides are anxious that the other should be blamed for unreasonable tactics. MPs say they have voted many times for an outright ban and have public opinion behind them. </p> <p>Tony Blair's spokesman confirmed that the prime minister personally backed a third way compromise but that his MPs had overruled him. \"Let us wait and see what the ... Lords does, but the prime minister has not changed his view at any point that it would be better if a compromise is agreed.\" </p> <p>Pro-hunting peers and MPs in all parties insisted that the government was abusing its power, in order to attack a traditional country pursuit for narrow party gain - based on class warfare and Mr Blair's urgent need to appease his own backbenches after being weakened over Iraq. </p> <p>They believe there must be a compromise that will keep hunting with dogs in some form and save the government from the kind of militant tactics, in an election campaign, that saw pro-hunters this September invade the floor of the Commons. </p> <p>They also think hunting is the least cruel way of culling foxes compared with gassing or shooting - a claim which enrages their opponents. </p> <p>Lord Whitty showed no sign of blinking in what has become a parliamentary poker game. He insisted it was up to the Lords to present \"a proposition which is likely to engage the majority in the House of Commons\". He added: \"If not, it is you who are putting us on course for the potential deadlock and therefore potential use of the Parliament Act.\" </p> <p>Lord Donoughue, a veteran Labour peer, emerged at the forefront of the pro-hunting lobby. He said that if the government \"does not accept this rational compromise, and also uses the draconian Parliament Act against its original proposals, then my government ... will ... be shamed and humiliated by its actions.\" </p> <p>Lord King of Bridgwater, a former defence secretary, said: \"It is ministers and the government who will have to pick up the mess if this goes through in a way that ministers have already admitted is unworkable and which could lead to serious tensions in this country.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair knows his MPs are fed up with waiting seven years to get a ban and that he will almost certainly have to use the Parliament Act - the act that allows a manifesto-pledged bill to be pushed through against Lords opposition after it has been rejected by peers in two successive sessions. The power dates from the Lloyd George budget crisis of 1911, but has rarely been used. Nowadays the issue is complicated by the European charter of human rights which pro-hunters will try to deploy. </p> <p><b>Battle lines</b></p> <p><b>A complete ban - chances 7/10</b><br> Labour MPs are in no mood to accept a compromise even if offered one. When the legislation returns to the Commons next month they are all but certain to vote once again to stop all hunting with dogs. This paves the way for the Parliament Act to be used and a ban becoming law. Any other result would be a surprise. </p> <p><b>A partial ban - chances 2/10</b><br> The prime minister still backs middle way proposals, banning some forms of hunting. Many pro-hunt campaigners are now prepared to accept this compromise. MPs have already rejected this option. </p> <p><b>No change - chances 1/10</b><br> Both houses seem to accept that the law should change - the question now is how. The bill could still fail if parliament runs out of time, or if a legal challenge blocks the use of the Parliament Act.</p>",
  "<b> Times</b> <br> Editorial, October 26 <p> \"It is ... bizarre that the government should now be preparing to drop its veto on asylum and immigration issues within the EU with barely any explanation and little attempt to forestall the outcry that Britain is surrendering sovereignty on an issue of crucial social and political importance ... </p> <p>\"Labour obviously fears that any talk of majority voting on asylum will be seized on by the Conservatives as a surrender to 'Europe', stoking anti-EU feeling.

  "<p>David O'Leary declared himself \"disgusted\" and \"embarrassed\" after his Aston Villa side's involvement in this season's Carling Cup came to an abrupt end at the hands of Steve Cotterill's patched-up Burnley side.</p> <p>Having picked his strongest XI with the aim of improving on last year's semi-final appearance, O'Leary had to concede that his team had been outplayed by a side who lie in the bottom half of the Championship and boast only 16 senior professionals, three of them missing last night.</p> <p>Burnley were in control from the moment Graham Branch rose to head home their ninth-minute opener and would have won by a more convincing margin had Robbie Blake not missed a 55th-minute penalty, the only blemish on an otherwise outstanding individual performance.</p> <p>\"As a Villa man it was embarrassing,\" said O'Leary. \"I don't want to take anything away from Burnley, because they were the better team by a mile. But I am disgusted by my players because the Villa fans deserve better than that. We came here with our best team because we wanted to take this competition seriously, but their keeper didn't have a shot to save before Angel scored.\"</p> <p>Burnley's third goal illustrated their confidence. Jean-Louis Valois, signed on a short-term contract only last month, weaved past two defenders before rifling an excellent shot into the roof of the net beyond the beleaguered Thomas Sorensen.</p> <p>Villa could have few complaints. Inspired by the effervescent Blake, Burnley went ahead when the home skipper out witted Villa's right-back Mark Delaney at the byline before picking out Branch at the far post. Blake's penalty miss did nothing to dent Burnley's confidence and Mo Camara made it two with a smart header in the 65th minute. Juan Pablo Angel gave Villa hope with another header in the 81st minute but this was always going to be Burnley's night.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Strachan and Micky Adams are expected to be among the leading candidates to become manager of West Bromwich Albion after the departure last night of Gary Megson. </p> <p>Megson's exit from The Hawthorns, after a 4-year spell that saw him twice take the club into the Premiership, had been on the cards for some weeks. </p> <p>Not only had his increasingly fractious relationship with the club's chairman Jeremy Peace become irreparable, the team's performances had also made his position tenuous. </p> <p>The team have won one game out of nine since returning to the Premiership and the nadir was reached at Crystal Palace last Saturday with a display Megson described as the worst he had witnessed since he succeeded Brian Little in the spring of 2000. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there was nothing straightforward about the parting of the ways. Megson had earlier revealed that he had informed the club's board he intended to leave in the summer when his contract was due to expire. He is now likely to claim he has been sacked and seek compensation, but the club claim that, by making it clear he would not prolong his stay, he effectively resigned. </p> <p>A statement issued by the club read: \"Gary Megson today informed the board of West Bromwich Albion by letter that he wishes to leave the club at the end of his current contract in approximately eight months' time on 30th June 2005. </p> <p>\"The club accepts this letter as a resignation and the board believes it is now in the best interests of West Bromwich Albion that Gary Megson no longer remains in charge of team affairs. As such, he has been relieved of his duties while contractual matters are resolved. </p> <p>\"This is a crucial period for the club and the board regards the timing and manner of Gary Megson's announcement as extremely unhelpful, particularly following the team's disappointing performance at Crystal Palace on Saturday. </p> <p>\"The board intends to move swiftly to appoint a new manager who will be fully focused on the job of taking the club forward in the Premiership. Until such time, Frank Burrows will act as caretaker manager. The board would like to acknowledge Gary Megson's major contribution during his term as manager and wishes him well in the future.\" </p> <p>The 45-year-old Megson has been expecting the sack for some time now - indeed some believe he courted it so he could take over as manager of Leicester City or Wales - and he effectively forced Peace to act by making his intentions clear. </p> <p>\"I think it's important that we all know where we stand,\" he said earlier yesterday. \"I won't sign a new deal at West Brom when my current contract finishes. I have sent a letter to the chairman and the board. All this does is make the situation clear. The current situation is doing nobody any good. I have made my mind up but I will keep doing my job until my contract finishes.\" </p> <p>Megson's statement presupposed that Peace would have offered him a new deal, which in itself was unlikely. </p> <p>Now Strachan, who has taken a break from football management since leaving Southampton last January, is understood to be Peace's favoured candidate. </p> <p>Southampton were in a similarly precarious position to West Brom when Strachan became manager in 2001 but he followed up the preservation of the club's Premiership status by taking the Saints to their first FA Cup final for 27 years. </p> <p>Adams, who resigned as Leicester City manager this month, also meets with the board's approval, as does Crystal Palace's Iain Dowie, a less likely recruit because he has just signed a five-year contract. Other out-of-work managers expected to be interested in the position include Glenn Hoddle, G\u00e9rard Houllier, John Gregory and Sir Bobby Robson, a former West Brom player. </p> <p>Megson, meanwhile, is understood to have expressed an interest in succeeding Mark Hughes as manager of Wales, but taking control at Leicester City appears the likelier option. </p> <p>His record of twice winning promotion to the Premiership appeals to the Foxes and he is believed to be the favoured candidate of Leicester's director of football Dave Bassett. He has also worked alongside Leicester's operations director, Paul Mace, when the latter managed West Brom's press and public relations department. </p> <p> <strong>Rivals for Hawthorns hot seat</strong></p> <p><strong> Gordon Strachan</strong> </p> <p> Former Coventry and Southampton manager, now television pundit and Guardian columnist; has also been linked with the Scotland job should it become vacant. </p> <p> <strong> Micky Adams</strong> </p> <p> Resigned from Leicester job this month. </p> <p> <strong> G\u00e9rard Houllier</strong> </p> <p> The former Liverpool manager has been out of work since leaving Anfield last May. </p> <p> <strong> Bryan Robson</strong> </p> <p> Has been linked with a variety of jobs since leaving Bradford this year.</p>",
  "<p>Portsmouth are ready to use the superglue approach to keep their record signing Diomansy Kamara on the pitch and away from suspension.</p> <p>The Senegalese striker was yellow-carded last night for removing his shirt after scoring - the second time in three days he had committed the offence.</p> <p>He fell foul of the law, which states that the removal of the jersey is to be punished with an automatic booking, after scoring his first Premiership goal at Middlesbrough on Sunday. And the \u00a32.3m forward clearly had not learnt his lesson when he repeated his misdemeanour after his 14th-minute strike against Leeds.</p> <p>Kamara's goal, which set Portsmouth on their way to the fourth round, was sublime.

  "<p>Rudyard Kipling's cat who walked alone had the right idea. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh have found that the pressures of shared living bring sensitive felines down with stress-related illness. The biggest source of anxiety is a rival cat in the house, but moving home, the arrival of a baby and not venturing outside were stressful. </p> <p>Danielle Gunn-Moore of the university's school of veterinary studies said: \"The neighbour's dog barking or the postman arriving on a Thursday isn't particularly stressful. We're looking at longer term stress and the classic source is living with a cat with which they don't get on.\" </p> <p>The relentless anxiety overstimulates nerves leading from the cat's brain to its bladder and provokes cystitis. </p> <p>Up to 60% of cases of the feline bladder condition seen by vets show no obvious cause, but a similar problem in people is linked to stress. \"We believed stress could be a trigger and wanted to identify differences in the cats' environments and temperaments which might cause this condition,\" Dr Gunn-Moore said. </p> <p>Her team compared 31 cats with bladder disease brought to the university's hospital for small animals to 24 healthy animals from the same households and a separate control group of 125 healthy cats. They found animals with a diseased bladder were more likely to be in conflict with a housemate. The results appear in the Journal of Small Animal Practice. </p> <p>\"In a household situation often a dominant cat will camp out on the stairs and prevent another, more timid one from coming past,\" she said. </p> <p>Other sources of anxiety included not venturing outside, having owners who worked night shifts and left their pets alone, and obnoxious children. One cat was made ill by the constant noise from low flying aircraft. </p> <p>The experts recommend that cats with the stress-related condition should be fed wet food and encouraged to drink more water, perhaps by adding tuna-flavoured ice cubes.</p>",
  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer surprised the City yesterday by announcing an unexpectedly high price for its offer to buy back shares from existing investors. </p> <p>The tender offer, at \u00a32.3bn the largest made yet by a British company, was the crucial plank in the strategy put together by chief executive Stuart Rose to fend off the unwanted \u00a39bn takeover attempt by Arcadia and BhS owner Philip Green in the summer. </p> <p>The City had been expecting the price at which M&amp;S would buy the shares to be about 356p a share - the middle of the offer range. But yesterday the retailer set the price at 362p, a 5p premium to Friday's closing price of 357p. The shares closed last night at 358.5p. </p> <p>There had been continued disquiet from some investors that the buyback had been priced below Mr Green's offer of 400p a share, but the company yesterday reiterated the arguments for the price range it chose last week by M&amp;S chairman Paul Myners at the extraordinary meeting. </p> <p>\"Mr Green's offer represented a premium to compensate the shareholders for los ing control of the company but investors will retain control under this tender offer,\" said a spokesman for M&amp;S. </p> <p>The chairman, who is also chairman of GMG, publisher of the Guardian, said he was pleased the offer had been successfully completed. </p> <p>As the offer was oversubscribed, investors who tendered their shares at the strike price will have their allocations cut by 43.4%. All offers below the strike price will be accepted in full and those above will be void, said M&amp;S. </p> <p>Rebecca McClellan, an analyst at the broker Exane, said: \"I think that this expresses a certain degree of confidence in what Rose is doing.\" </p> <p>Although details about which shareholders have taken up the offer will not emerge until later in the week, interest is thought more likely to have come from institutional rather than private investors, who hold about 25% of the company. This means private shareholders will have increased their level of control. </p> <p>\"Private investors want the new management team to improve the operating performance of the company so that the share price rises above 400p a share,\" the company spokesman said. </p> <p>About 20% of the M&amp;S share capital is thought to be held by hedge funds who bought shares to gamble on the takeover battle - and the huge tender was designed in part to flush out such short-term holders. </p> <p>The number of shares in issue will be cut by 635.4m and could boost earnings per share by as much as 20%. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the company said: \"The fact that the offer was priced so close to the mid-value indicates that we got the offer range correct.\"</p>",
  "I find it very hard to get worked up about cocaine use, and harder still to get outraged about punching members of the paparazzi in the face. Those pap guys love getting punched - they have facial scarring instead of CVs. I also find it hard to get exercised about the activities of young royals, or anyone connected with them, though I do seem to have an uncanny memory for what they've been up to. <p>So, when James Green, one-time boyfriend of Princess Beatrice of somewhere (does she have a somewhere?), was kicked out of Harrow for taking coke in a local restaurant, it reminded me in passing of some other toffs who've been nobbled for non-prescription drugs. Tom Parker Bowles, son of Camilla, admitted cocaine use in 1999; Lord Frederick Windsor, 28th in line to the throne, also admitted using the drug in 1999; Tara Palmer-Tomkinson regaled the world at around this time with tales of her cocaine addiction, though she'd become rather pantomimey thanks to her hard-won public profile, so the news didn't seem to rock the establishment that much. </p> <p>You may be wondering what that has to do with Harry \"Don't call him the Party Prince\" Windsor, whose recent antics were nothing to do with cocaine, and everything to do with mild assault. The connection is that all this behaviour is illegal. All those new initiatives, where you can ban people from city centres for \"yob-like\" acts such as talking too loud, drinking too much, dressing in matching Burberry check in a sinister fashion, fail to take into account the most salient point. There's just no call for new laws or initiatives: we have all the laws we need to lock up as many young and boisterous people as we like. But, ah yes - they're the wrong sort of young people. </p> <p>Frederick Windsor made a telling remark in apology for his drug disgrace: \"I admit it is true. It is very difficult to avoid getting into this sort of thing when you move in these circles, but I don't blame anyone else for the incident.\" Well. That's big of him. The interesting bit of that statement is \"when you move in these circles\". All of us, including the rich themselves, have a tendency to think of this set as a loose, ham-fisted cross between Brideshead and F Scott Fitzgerald. They have different rules of moral engagement, since everything they do is filed under the ethically neutral category of impossible glamour. </p> <p>It's all such revolting nonsense - cocaine doesn't limit itself to any social circle. There's absolutely nothing exclusive or glamorous about it. Everyone, everywhere who is slightly too old to drink all night without falling over takes this banal and workaday drug. It's as cheap as chips. Plus, you can offset the cost of the chips that you didn't have to buy because the coke killed your appetite. </p> <p>Likewise, everyone, everywhere, who's had a lot to drink and gets discombobulated by some rude jostling might consider throwing a punch. It has nothing at all to do with \"facing pressure as a young man trying to make his way in the world\", or whatever other guff the palace spokesman came out with on Harry's behalf. All of this is caused by straightforward, standard-issue over-indulgence. It does not relate to class in any way, but the way we react to it varies wildly, according to the parentage of the culprit. </p> <p>We affect great moral outrage when it comes from the upper classes, but we would rarely take a guy like James Green to be emblematic of a breakdown in wider society. People only tub-thump about social disintegration when they're talking about delinquency from the working classes. The shock reaction to delinquency from the rich is of a much more fawning, lickspittle kind, which ultimately amounts to: \"You people are supposed to be setting us an example!\" </p> <p>Nobody ever talks about \"trends\" or \"crime waves\" in relation to the rich, even though if Beatrice's boyfriend, Prince Charles's common-law stepson and Princess Michael of Kent's firstborn are at it, you can be damn sure they're not the only ones. Waves of drug use only ever occur among the proles. Is this because there are so many more poor people than there are rich ones, and we're just applying an uncharacteristic rigour to our use of words like \"wave\"? Or is it because we see the working classes as an undifferentiated and uncontrollable mass, and the upper classes as these exotic individuals, who - gasp! - did a bad thing in front of the servants. </p> <p>On balance, I think drugs should be legal and photographers should have better manners. But pending those twin improvements I'd like to see these \"circles\" of young aristos being marched to cash points and fined, being banned from city centres, maybe getting slapped with an Asbo and barred from hanging out together, even in respectable gatherings involving ponies. Our double standards are confounding and, worse, horribly passe. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:zoe_williams@ntlworld.com\">zoe_williams@ntlworld.com</a></p>",
  "Ariel Sharon opened a bitter debate in parliament yesterday over his plan to remove Jewish settlers from Gaza by saying it paves the way towards a Palestinian state while strengthening Israel's grip over its West Bank colonies. <p>Mr Sharon was repeatedly interrupted and heckled as he defended the \"disengagement plan\" ahead of a vote today that is expected to split his ruling Likud party and force a realignment of Israeli politics. </p> <p>\"I learned from experience that one cannot be victorious by the sword alone. We do not wish to rule forever over millions of Palestinians whose population is doubling every generation. Israel wishes to be a democracy and cannot do it. The disengagement is a gateway to another reality,\" the prime minister said. </p> <p>\"I am absolutely determined to implement this measure to the bitter end. I am absolutely convinced that this disengagement will strengthen Israel in its control over the territory which is vital for our survival, for our continued existence.\" </p> <p>Israeli politicians interpreted Mr Sharon's oblique reference to vital territory as meaning the main West Bank settlements which he has long championed as a crucial part of the country's defence. </p> <p>Hours earlier, Israeli forces killed at least 14 Palestinians, including an 11-year-old boy, two policemen and several armed men, in a tank and missile raid on Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza. At least 70 people were wounded, many of them civilians. </p> <p>The army said the operation was aimed at curbing rocket attacks on the neighbouring Gush Katif Jewish settlements, but Palestinians said the timing suggested an attempt by the government to influence the debate in parliament. </p> <p>Mr Sharon opened the session on his plan to dismantle all 21 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and four small ones in the West Bank by praising the settlers but warning that some, who stake a biblical claim to the land, had developed a Messianic complex. </p> <p>He described the decision to shut the Gaza settlements as the most difficult of his career and said he felt responsible for the settlers because he was instrumental in encouraging them to live in there, but he denied misleading them. </p> <p>Mr Sharon pointedly said that his unilateral strategy is not a replacement for the US-led \"road map\" following comments earlier this month by his chief aide, Dov Weisglass, who said the disengagement strategy was designed to freeze peace talks and prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. </p> <p>\"The disengagement plan is no substitute for negotiations nor does it wish to have a complete stalemate forever,\" the prime minister the prime minister said. </p> <p>But a reference by Mr Sharon to \"dividing up the land, the [occupied] territories\" confirmed that he has not shifted from his desire to solidify Israel's control over 120 settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem that are home to about 420,000 Jews while carving out an emasculated Palestinian homeland on the rest of the territory. </p> <p>Three MPs were ejected from the chamber for heckling Mr Sharon, including Uri Ariel. \"You are tearing the nation apart. Go home. You must not expel Jews,\" he shouted at the prime minister. </p> <p>Thousands of settlers and their supporters plan to ring the parliament today to protest against the vote. </p> <p>Mr Sharon is likely to win the vote on the plan but as many as half of his own party's MPs will oppose it, forcing him to rely on the opposition Labour party to push it through.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> Last week Ruth Winston-Jones went to the high court to oppose an application by two NHS trusts for a declaration that her severely ill baby should, in effect, be allowed to die without the doctors trying too hard to prolong his doomed life. Two weeks ago Debbie and Darren Wyatt were at the same court for the same reason. <p>The two babies had different conditions, but in each case the prognosis was early death, though they might live a little longer if the medical teams took certain action. The doctors felt that such intervention was not in the best interests of the child. The parents, understandably, disagreed. In both cases - and, as far as I know, in every similar case that has come before the courts - medical opinion was preferred over parental wishes (though Winston-Jones did gain some concessions). </p> <p>There is one aspect of the two cases that troubles me. Both cases were fought out in public, in open court. Usually such sensitive disputes are handled by the court in private, because everyone involved wants it so. But parents are entitled to ask that the proceedings be in public. What made me slightly uneasy was that, soon after the decision in the Wyatt baby's case, the parents' exclusive story appeared in the Daily Mail; last Sunday Winston-Jones's exclusive story appeared in the Mail on Sunday. Both stories were paid for. </p> <p>I don't believe these parents were motivated by money, but might not their experience serve as a signal to other parents to go public and get public trials, to ensure the subsequent sales of their stories? Is it a good thing for such cases to be held under full media coverage, with the courts being used as a sort of springboard for even greater publicity? </p> <p>Yet why shouldn't the parents who have suffered so, not make what money they can from their misfortune, money which may be of better use in their hands than lying in newspaper coffers? I am still a little uneasy, but I'm not sure why. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I fear for justice. Yesterday the home secretary took steps towards implementing a profoundly dangerous law - one that would allow juries to be told about an accused's previous convictions. From mid-December, for most criminal offences, there will be a presumption that juries will be told of the accused's record for the crime for which he's standing trial. </p> <p>Yes, the trial judge will have the power to rule such evidence inadmissible, and yes, there have been cases where guilty offenders have been acquitted because the jury hadn't been aware of their past. But I have little doubt that many innocent people will be convicted, not on the basis of the evidence given in court, but on the assumption that \"he's done this sort of thing before, he must be guilty this time\". A sad day for English justice. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The television advertisement opens with a blurry image of children at play. \"He used candy to lure the children into the house,\" a doom-laden voice intones, accompanied by sinister music. \"Once inside, the three children were sexually molested, a four-year-old girl raped. And then the punchline: \"Despite prosecutors' objections, Judge Lloyd Karmeier gave him probation.\" This was an ad shown recently in Illinois, as part of another election - for judges of the state's supreme court. </p> <p>Judicial races in those states (the majority) which elect judges used to be relatively dignified affairs, but campaigning this year has been dirty and vicious. Millions of dollars are being raised from business interests and lawyers; television ads, sparingly used in the past, are proliferating, and many of them are unpleasantly personal. Any judge who has shown any hint of being (in his opponent's eyes) soft on crime is vilified. </p> <p>Doesn't it make you feel good that our unaccountable judges are still chosen in such a secretive and untransparent manner? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> There's a racehorse called Marcel, who keeps winning (four in a row, so far). I've refrained from mentioning him to you before because I'm not sure he fits the criterion for my turf investment advice service - the name of the horse must be closely and obviously linked to the law or the justice system. The only possible link is me. Am I entitled to say that I, as a legal columnist, am the necessary connection? Frankly, I doubt it. But Marcel is running tomorrow at Cheltenham and he may win, though probably at poor odds, so I thought I'd better tell you about him.</p>",
  "Last week Yvonne Hossack, a solicitor who has campaigned for seven years against care home closures, had to sell her much-loved Y-reg Vauxhall Astra to keep her Northamptonshire-based law firm afloat. \"It's no Porsche but I'm going to miss it,\" she says. When it comes to totting up her personal sacrifices, that one is strictly minor league. Hossack reckons she is now facing bankruptcy. She is also splitting up from her husband and selling her share in the family house. <p>\"I've given my life for this work, gladly, and lost everything - business, marriage, home. But I've done it for a reason. I hear my clients sobbing. I come in to work to letters telling me they've died. We all have to die. It is important, though, to die a good death - not in the hands of strangers in unfamiliar surroundings.\" </p> <p>For Hossack the enemy isn't the local authority bean-counters who shut down care homes or faceless Whitehall bureaucrats drawing up policy, it's the Legal Services Commission (LSC), which operates the legal aid scheme. She is preparing a libel case against the LSC over correspondence she discovered through an application under the Data Protection Act in February. Hossack claims that the LSC is \"waging a campaign\" against her, freezing payments and trying to shut down her practice because of the politically charged nature of her work. The commission denies this and argues that local solicitors around the country could and should be mounting the challenges to the closure of care homes. By Hossack's own reckoning, she has 700 clients in 24 local authorities. </p> <p>Elizabeth Howard's 87-year-old blind and deaf godmother is one of 36 frail and elderly residents at the High Haven residential home in Downham Market, Norfolk, which was threatened with closure last year. \"We were distraught because Norfolk county council was going to shut High Haven down and sell it off, probably, to property developers,\" Howard says. \"It is shameful that no one gives a damn for the lives of the very elderly any more - no one, that is, except for Yvonne Hossack.\" </p> <p>Elderly People in Crisis, a charity founded by Hossack, tracked the fate of 41 elderly residents at one home that closed who were subsequently rehoused. Within a year, 15 had died. </p> <p>The High Haven relatives had given up the fight when they were handed Hossack's name by a BBC producer, Ken Kirby, who was reporting on care home closures. \"Yvonne Hossack used the law and the press to scare the living daylights out of Norfolk council and if it wasn't for her the home would have closed and many of our loved ones would be dead,\" Howard says.\"It really is as simple as that.\" She was one of many people who nominated the solicitor for this year's Legal Aid Lawyer of the Year award, given by the Legal Aid Practitioners Group. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, when there are problems with the availability of public money for controversial cases, frustrated claimants often hit out at the LSC for allegedly doing the bidding of their political masters. But that charge is not often made by claimants' lawyers. </p> <p>Phil Shiner, the Birmingham-based solicitor who represented CND in its legal action against the government on the legality of the Iraqi war, has come into conflict with the LSC over his equally sensitive action on behalf of Iraqi civilians injured by UK troops. Tabloid opprobrium was heaped on him for sending out a case worker, Mazin Younis, to Iraq to take instructions from people whose relatives had allegedly been killed by British troops. The Labour MP Gisela Stuart described his work as \"disgraceful ambulance chasing\". </p> <p>Shiner applied for public funding in February, and signed up to a special legal aid contract for high cost cases in July. But the LSC still has not paid out. Despite the press vilification, he hasn't made a penny out of the Iraqi cases. In fact he has remortgaged his house to raise some of the \u00a335,000 cost of pursuing the case so far. </p> <p>Shiner alleges that the government \"attempts to make it impossible for human rights lawyers to challenge its most controversial decisions\" and seeks \"to intimidate us through an increasingly Draconian funding regime\". </p> <p>He adds: \"It seems that the end game is to force us to give up our contracts, go out of business or to an early death through the stress of it all. If the government's decisions go unchallenged as a result that is a crucially important constitutional deficit.\" </p> <p>The LSC calls any suggestion of political interference in its decision-making \"an insult\". A spokesman says: \"We are totally operationally independent from any government department. There is a strict set of corporate governance procedures drawn up and absolutely no avenue whatsoever for government to influence any of our decisions.\" </p> <p>He says Shiner should finally be receiving legal aid for the Iraqi cases this week. Why the delay? \"He's a campaigning solicitor and he's breaking new ground. But we have to check there is legal merit in what he's applying for and, if there is no precedent, then that is going to take a little longer.\" </p> <p>Campaigning lawyers support the way that Shiner and Hossack have gone about approaching clients. The solicitor Louise Christian has had her own fights with the LSC, most recently in her work on behalf of the victims of the Potters Bar rail disaster. Christian defends Shiner's methods. She argues that there is a \"huge difference between ambulance-chasing of an ethically obnoxious kind\" by claims companies such as the now defunct Claims Direct and \"a campaigning lawyer going out and creating a case to highlight a cause\". She says that distinction appears to be lost on the LSC. </p> <p>Hossack alleges that the internal LSC correspondence about her is evidence of a concerted effort to shut down her practice. In the exchange, a senior LSC official fires off an email complaining about solicitors \"rampaging far and wide across the country taking on work in which they profess expertise (where there are other solicitors who profess the same expertise and may even possess it)\". A colleague responds, saying that the firm \"that we wish to subject to the distant solicitor condition is, of course, Hossacks of Kettering\". (The condition says solicitors outside the area can claim only the same travelling expenses a local solicitor would incur.) </p> <p>He then talks about the possibility of curtailing Hossacks' work outside the East Midlands but expresses caution because of her apparent readiness to resort to judicial review. \"[If] we lose or concede on the basis of a technical error it will only encourage her to pursue her eccentric path free of constraint,\" he adds. </p> <p>The LSC denies Hossack's claims \"absolutely\" and insists that it will \"robustly defend its position\". \"We would like to reassure Yvonne Hossack that, contrary to her belief, the LSC is not 'waging a campaign' against her or her firm,\" a spokesman says. \"We are simply trying to ensure that we obtain the best possible value for money in funding services.\" </p> <p>Such assurances do little to convince Hossack. \"I don't believe that the actions that have been taken against me are the actions of particular individuals on a whim of their own. If they had been, those individuals would have been suspended. I believe these actions were not only sanctioned by, but also encouraged by the government.\" </p> <p>What does the exchange reveal about the commission? \"It's worrying that there is a personal tone that seems to indicate that the LSC hasn't been able to take an entirely dispassionate view of the matter and approach it in a calm and proper man ner,\" says Richard Miller, chairman of the Legal Aid Practitioners Group. </p> <p>But Miller is not convinced that the intemperate language reflects much other than understandable LSC concerns. \"You can see a legitimate argument as to why taxpayers shouldn't be paying for a solicitor to be travelling around the country doing cases when there are local solicitors who are capable of doing the job,\" he adds. The LSC points out that there are as many as 60 solicitors around the country with legal aid franchises to do community care cases who are more than capable of doing the work. </p> <p>Among the nominations supporting Hossack for the Legal Aid Lawyer of the Year award, one supporter noted that her clients were \"among the most vulnerable, least articulate, of least socio-economic power, least fashionable and ... abominably represented\". Elizabeth Howard asks: \"If Yvonne Hossack wasn't on our side who would be?\"</p>",
  "Sebastian (Bas) Pease, who has died aged 81, was a distinguished physicist and a remarkable man. The director of Britain's fusion research programme at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) for many years, he was a leading member of the Pugwash Group, the international movement of scientists concerned about the social impact and misuse of science. <p>His scientific expertise and social conscience echoed his family background, with its Quaker roots. His paternal grandfather, Edward Reynolds Pease, was a co-founder of the Fabian Society and of the Labour Party. His father was a geneticist, while his mother was the daughter of Josiah C Wedgwood, who became a member of the first Labour Cabinet. Pease was educated in the stimulating and liberal atmosphere of Bedales school and took a degree in physics at Trinity College, Cambridge. </p> <p>In 1942, he joined the operational research unit at the headquarters of RAF bomber command, High Wycombe, where he worked on the development of \"blind\" bombing equipment and the use of aluminium \"window\" foil to deceive the German radars over the location of the D-day landings. He moved to the general physics division at Harwell in 1947 to work on solid-state research, producing some of the classic work on radiation damage and neutron diffraction. </p> <p>His main work on controlled nuclear fusion started in 1955, when, still at Harwell, he became leader of the physics research section, and later came to play a leading role in the Zeta (Zero Energy Thermonuclear Assembly) research team, which worked on the containment of hot plasma in a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) magnetic field. (When the results of his work there were published, the Daily Mail placed him on its shortlist of the most attractive men in the world.) </p> <p>The British fusion programme's work was transferred to Culham, Oxfordshire, in 1964, where he became division head and later, in 1967, director of the Culham Laboratory. Budget cuts and difficult times followed, but he managed to ensure that Culham maintained a broadly based fusion programme, including the initiation of a programme of commercial research in which Culham's skills were put to the needs of industry. </p> <p>Notwithstanding the cold war, Pease collaborated with Russian fusion experts, which was crucial in establishing the credibility of their tokamak - a pioneering plasma containment concept - claims. Pease formed a close and life-long rapport with their leader, Lev Artsimovich. </p> <p>In 1970, he opened a dialogue with Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community) on British participation in its programme, though Britain was not yet a member of the European Community. When Britain did join, in 1973, Culham became involved in the Joint European Torus working group (Jet), and Pease pushed for the tokamak experiment to have a more ambitious design objective, to achieve a full-scale demonstration of thermonuclear fusion. He was subsequently involved in a long political wrangle over the location of Jet, and deserves much of the credit for the eventual decision of the EU council of ministers in 1977 that it should be at Culham. </p> <p>While Jet remains the world's leading fusion research apparatus, Pease was already pushing for its successor, Iter (international thermonuclear experimental reactor), itself now quagmired in geopolitical debate. He retired in 1988. </p> <p>His many honours included election to the Royal Society in 1977 (he became a council member and vice-president), and the award of the Glazebrook medal, the premier award in Britain for physics, in 1989. However, with his exceptional combination of long-range vision and tactical skill, his outstanding contribution to the British fusion programme was as a manager of what had become \"big science\". In the nuclear debate, Bas was a crossbencher - a strong advocate for the use of nuclear power, but equally opposed to nuclear weapons. He was a prominent member of the British Pugwash Group and a member of its international council when the Nobel peace prize was awarded jointly to it and its then president, Joseph Rotblat, in 1995. He contributed to a number of Pugwash publications, including one giving the case against the replacement of Trident. </p> <p>Bas was very much a family man. His first wife, Susan, had five children, and he used to take the whole family, including grandchildren, on holiday - though was sometimes heard to mutter that \"a round of ice cream would set you back\". Accomplished on both the clarinet and piano, he played in the Newbury amateur symphony orchestra. He also loved walking and entertaining his friends in his Berkshire home. </p> <p>After Susan's death in 1996, he married Jean, whom he had known at Culham. She died in 2000, and he married Eleanor, who survives him along with his three sons and two daughters. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Rendel Sebastian Pease, physicist, born November 2 1922; died October 17 2004</p>",
  "<p>There is always plenty to admire in Angela Hewitt's piano playing - clarity, control and intelligence perhaps most of all - and a strong contingent of the Wigmore Hall audience clearly felt there was nothing missing from this particular recital. Yet even as she rounded off her encores by bringing a lovely, understated touch to Schumann's Traumerei, Hewitt left us feeling that she hadn't quite plumbed the nethermost emotional depths this time. </p> <p>Admittedly, her slightly dry programme in the first half was unlikely to have taken us there. Still, her delivery of the opening work - the 13\u00e8me Ordre from Couperin's third book of keyboard pieces - was enough to make us glad that the authenticity police have not yet declared it a crime to perform this composer's music on the piano rather than the harpsichord. Hewitt's light, seamless playing brought out its richness where other pianists, bogged down in the relentless ornamentation of Couperin's style, might have made it sound cumbersome. The final movement, a sombre lament almost reminiscent of Purcell, provided some of the recital's most heartfelt moments. </p> <p>Couperin shared the first half with Mendelssohn, whose two Preludes and Fugues in E and F minor were a reminder that the composer who rekindled interest in Bach's music could spin a mean fugue himself. There was much thunder here, yet some of the loudest stretches sounded harsh. </p> <p>The second half proved more interesting. Hewitt brought a haunting touch to the sixth of Faur\u00e9's Op 73 Variations in C sharp minor, her hands at either extreme of the keyboard; each successive variation on the almost grumbly theme was more intriguing. </p> <p>After so many fugues and variations, it was a relief to encounter a work as free in its inspiration as Schumann's Humoreske. Between its wistful first movement and its slowly flowing close, the piece found Hewitt showing a quirkier, more playful side that bordered on the exhilarating. Perhaps, though, Hewitt is too reliably in control to get us right to the edges of our seats. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Repeated tonight. Box office: 020-7935 2141.</p>",
  "<b>Paul Joseph writes: </b>One outstanding ability of Ray Simons, known politically as Ray Alexander (obituary, October 18), was to understand the role of black people, particularly the black workers in the struggle for a democratic South Africa. <p>She made sure to train men and women to take over the leadership.

  "The Israeli government has given Yasser Arafat permission to leave his Ramallah headquarters for the first time in two years to receive medical treatment, following visits by two teams of foreign doctors to treat the 75 year-old Palestinian leader for what his aides insist is only flu. <p>The defence ministry said Mr Arafat would be allowed to visit a Ramallah hospital on condition he returns to the battered headquarters, still partially destroyed after an Israeli assault in 2002, that has become his de facto prison. </p> <p>But Palestinian officials said Mr Arafat had made no request to visit the hospital and would not be doing so. </p> <p>Mr Arafat has previously refused to leave the compound, known as the muqata, because he feared Israeli forces would move in to seize a number of wanted Palestinian combatants sheltering there. </p> <p>The Palestinian leader's health has been the subject of intense speculation over recent days following the visit of two teams of doctors, from Egypt and Tunisia, to examine him. </p> <p>A delegation of five Tunisian doctors arrived at the muqata at the weekend after the Tunisian president, Zine al-Abidine, asked the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, to allow them in. </p> <p>Although Palestinian officials stuck by the story that their leader only has flu, Israeli officials said that the specialists among the Tunisian team suggested he was being treated for something much more serious. </p> <p>The Tunisian doctors carried out a series of tests including an endoscopy to check his stomach. Speculation has centred on the possibility of intestinal cancer. </p> <p>The doctors declined to talk to reporters. Palestinian officials said the doctors had concluded that Mr Arafat did not need surgery at this stage. They denied he had cancer. </p> <p>Ten days ago, Egyptian doctors visited Mr Arafat after he was unable to complete the first day of Ramadan prayers and did not follow his usual ritual of receiving delegations at the muqata for his holiday blessings. </p> <p>Israel's Channel Two television reported that both teams of doctors concluded that Mr Arafat was suffering from gallstones and had an intestinal infection. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's personal doctor, Ashraf al-Kurdi, said his patient is in relatively good health but had suffered a bout of acute flu. </p> <p>A Palestinian cabinet minister, Saeb Erekat, said Mr Arafat's health was good. </p> <p>An Arab Israeli MP, Ahmed Tibi, a doctor who is close to Mr Arafat, told Israeli radio the Palestinian leader's health was normal. \"He was struck by the flu recently but is better,\" he said. </p> <p>Concerns about Mr Arafat's health has also prompted discussion about whether he might be granted permission to travel abroad for treatment. </p> <p>The Israeli government is divided about whether to permit him to leave the country. Some politicians would like to drive him into exile, others argue that it is better to keep him imprisoned and isolated in Ramallah. </p> <p>Mr Arafat is likely to reject any permission to travel without a guarantee from the Israelis that he could return to the occupied territories. </p> <p>Sakher Habash, a central committee member of Mr Arafat's Fatah movement, said he believed that if the Palestinian leader left the occupied territories, Israel would use the opportunity to expel him or to kill him, \"in a way that his death would seem to be a normal death\". </p> <p>He added: \"It seems that Israel is trying to spread rumours about Arafat's health and his need for a surgery.\"</p>",
  "Worried about ageism? Not me. Unlike you retired-at-60 lot, I'm still working in my 70s and will go on until - well, whenever. And not because the government tells me I have to. <p>You see, I'm an actor and, despite bleatings from 50-60 year-olds about there being no parts for older women, I'm living proof that they just have to be patient and keep at least fit enough to hobble to castings. At an audition I attended recently with a 90-year old, I think her Zimmer Frame helped to get her the part instead of me. </p> <p>My husband sometimes lets his age get to him.

  "Whether George Bush or John Kerry wins the White House next Tuesday, the next president faces an overflowing in-tray of international problems. <p>America's global power has never been greater. But never, since the September 11 catastrophe, has America's global leadership been under such sustained challenge. Rarely have issues of foreign policy had such a direct, existential bearing on America's sense of itself and its security. Rarely has what the American president decides mattered so much to so many. </p> <p>The most immediate worry is the security situation in Iraq. As the US tries to steer the country to elections in January, the predicted surge in violence may be compounded by a Sunni Muslim poll boycott. The insurgent redoubt of Falluja is again the likely, lethal flashpoint. </p> <p>Iran's nuclear ambitions are moving up the agenda. On November 25, the International Atomic Energy Agency must decide whether to report Iran to the UN security council. If it does so, punitive sanctions could follow. If the UN fails to agree, the White House will come under pressure, not least from Israel, to consider unilateral measures including possible military action. </p> <p>The next president will also quickly face demands, from Britain's Tony Blair among others, to launch a new drive to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict - which many European and Arab governments view as a precondition for winning the \"war on terror\". </p> <p>Other problems in need of action include the humanitarian crisis in Sudan that Congress has termed genocide but which is proving resistant to international remedies. </p> <p>Some European diplomats fear a second Bush term could open the way for a sweeping expansion of Republican neo-conservative policies. This would only exacerbate existing divisions over issues such as the Kyoto climate change treaty, global trade and development, and international law. </p> <p>Victory for Mr Kerry would entail different kinds of uncertainty. A sort of interregnum would ensue until his inauguration next January. Once in office, a new Democratic administration would take months to settle in - confronted in all probability by a hostile Republican-controlled Congress. </p> <p>Whoever wins, these are some of the principal issues facing the next president: </p> <p><b> Anti-Americanism </b><br> </p> <p>The Bush presidency has brought a surge in anti-American sentiment, notably in the Arab, Muslim and European spheres. This phenomenon is undermining US influence and effectiveness across the board, making it difficult to persuade others to follow America's lead. </p> <p>For the first time, the US is seen by majorities in many countries, especially by younger Muslims, as a potential enemy rather than a friend. </p> <p>Such conclusions are borne out by a clutch of international opinion surveys and by an official worldwide study undertaken last year by a former US ambassador, Edward Djerejian. He found the US was losing the battle for hearts and minds. Since then, the Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Abu Ghraib abuse scandals have further damaged America's standing abroad. </p> <p><b>Terrorism </b><br> </p> <p>While the next president will be under intense pressure to win the \"war on terror\", it remains unclear exactly who or where the enemy is - or how it can best be defeated. </p> <p>Despite the elimination of some leading al-Qaida figures, Osama bin Laden remains at large. Meanwhile, al-Qaida's cause has devolved to loose-knit, copycat groups in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Chechnya and Pakistan. The Iraq insurgency has proved both magnet and recruiting sergeant for Islamist extremists. </p> <p>Mr Bush has repeatedly claimed to have al-Qaida and its affiliates on the run. But a report this month by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London estimated that al-Qaida can potentially draw on 18,000 operatives in 60 countries. Al-Qaida, it said, had been \"galvanised\" by the Iraq war. </p> <p>Unless remedial action is taken, the \"war on terror\" will continue to be destabilising in geo-political terms. It has been used by states such as Israel, Russia and China to justify harsher treatment of nationalists and separatists. It has drawn the US into problematic alliances with undemocratic regimes in central Asia. And it has led to divisive erosion of civil liberties abroad and in the US. </p> <p><b>Proliferation </b><br> </p> <p>Mr Bush and Mr Kerry agree that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the single most serious threat to international security. While the next president's focus will be on Iran and North Korea, a bigger fear is that non-state actors such as al-Qaida will obtain WMD. North Korea claims already to have nuclear weapons. Multilateral negotiations to induce it to disarm have stalled. Mr Kerry says he will talk directly to Pyongyang, something Mr Bush refuses to do. </p> <p>Syria is another concern, as is a region-wide Middle East WMD arms race should Iran obtain the bomb. Unsecured WMD-related stockpiles in the former Soviet Union and smuggling rings like that uncovered in Pakistan are also a big worry vis \u00e0 vis future terrorist capabilities. </p> <p>All these problems are compounded by the weakness of international regulation, inspection and verification regimes and by the \"double standards\" of existing nuclear powers which refuse to renounce their weapons. </p> <p><b>Conflict zones </b><br> </p> <p>The US urgently needs more international military and UN civilian support in Iraq. Washington will ask Nato and Muslim countries to contribute additional troops at a conference in Egypt next month. Severe US military over-stretch lies behind the recent, controversial request for British redeployments in Iraq. Overall, meeting America's myriad global military commitments is becoming increasingly expensive and problematic in terms of personnel, hence the speculation about a post-election draft. </p> <p>The US remains heavily committed in Afghanistan, with 20,000 troops still fighting the Taliban and al-Qaida. There are also growing concerns about a reviving instability in the Balkans, particularly in Kosovo where final-status talks are due to begin next year. </p> <p>Israel-Palestine and Iraq apart, the Middle East as a whole remains a critical national security concern for any US president, given America's chronic dependence on oil. Bilateral post-9/11 relations with Saudi Arabia are especially fraught. </p> <p><b> Old rivals</b> </p> <p>China's rapid economic growth is creating political and geo-strategic challenges for America which the next president will be forced to address. </p> <p>Bilateral trade is booming. The Olympics are coming to Beijing. But China remains an undemocratic Communist state with a poor human rights record. President Hu Jintao is an unknown quantity. Yet the US needs China's good offices if, for example, the North Korean stand-off is to be ended. </p> <p>Russia is another potential problem, despite relatively greater stability under Mr Putin. Moscow's reaction to the Beslan school tragedy has revived questions about the Russian president's authoritarianism - which also affects countries in the \"near abroad\" like Ukraine and Georgia </p> <p>Like China, Russia is developing new long-range missiles in response to Mr Bush's \"son of Star Wars\" ballistic missile defence project, prompting fears of a new arms race. </p> <p><b> Multilateralism </b><br> </p> <p>US relations with leading European Union countries, especially France, are in need of repair. But trade and other disputes with the EU will certainly figure on the next president's agenda. </p> <p>More fundamentally challenging is the EU's gradual emergence as a global political player. Its development of a collective military capability, potentially undermining Nato, is a gauntlet that the White House may be obliged to pick up. This in turn relates to knotty questions about the legitimacy of intervention and \"just war\" concepts. </p> <p>Radically different European attitudes to the UN and upholding international law through institutions such as the world court and the international criminal court are key areas of contention. UN reform is another pressing issue. </p> <p>Underlying all these concerns is the European insistence on multilateral approaches to common problems, in contrast to Bush-era unilateralism. For the next president, perhaps the most difficult challenge will be to decide if and when the US goes it alone. If Mr Bush has proved anything, it is that even America cannot do it all.</p>",
  "<p>Theressia Gresham's unemployment cheques stopped arriving two months ago. Ms Gresham, who lives in Cleveland, Ohio, lost her job as a forklift driver at the beginning of the year and has been unable to find work since. The United States government will pay just 26 weeks of benefits before cutting workers loose to fend for themselves. The Bush administration, convinced that the economy is on the rebound, recently ended a programme extending the payments a further 13 weeks. She can't afford to be ill because she has no healthcare insurance, although she has developed high blood pressure and diabetes since being unemployed. </p> <p>Ms Gresham, 42, who has worked all her life, now spends her days at the United Labor Agency, a federally funded organisation that helps people get back to work, sending out job applications, researching on the internet and hoping. America's flexible labour market is much admired by the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, but the downside to the dynamism is that for those who fall on hard times life is cruel. There are 93,000 people in Ohio who are now living without unemployment benefits and Theressia is one of them. </p> <p>\"I've exhausted everything,\" she says, looking close to tears. \"I have no income. Sometimes my mother loans me money but she is an elderly woman. I can't get the medications I need. I didn't even know the unemployment was going to stop. My rent was due Saturday and I told my landlord I would have it by the end of the week, but I probably won't. This is just awful.\" </p> <p>The United States treasury secretary John Snow last week told an audience in Ohio that the oft-cited jobs lost under the presidency of George Bush were a myth. He later had to retract the claim: Ms Gresham and millions like her are the reality - a working-class that the government and much of America would rather ignore. </p> <p>According to the census bureau, another 1.3 million Americans fell below the poverty line last year, taking the total to 35.9 million, around 12.5% of the population. The number of people without health insurance grew by 1.4 million to 45 million. Since Bush arrived in the White House, the number below the poverty line has risen by 4.3 million, the number lacking healthcare by 5.2 million. </p> <p>Cleveland, in the battleground state of Ohio, was recently judged to be the poorest big city in America by the US census bureau, toppling Detroit. Steve Newman, who runs the United Labor Agency, says the number of people coming through the organisation looking for work has tripled over the past three years. </p> <p>Bush, he notes, has at least increased the agency's funding. </p> <p>Built on manufacturing, Cleveland has suffered the fate of many industrial cities in America's north-east. With its grand buildings from a more prosperous era, it has the feel of one of Britain's northern industrial cities, hollowed out by de-industrialisation. The population has steadily fallen as people headed for the new jobs in the suburbs, leaving behind a city with dwindling tax dollars and needy people. Lay-offs have not been confined to manufacturing. The city has shed 700 teachers and in East Cleveland, a lack of money has forced cuts in the numbers of police officers patrolling some of Ohio's meanest streets. </p> <p>According to Ohio Policy Matters, a bipartisan thinktank based in the city, any recovery from the recession that began in 2001 has passed the state by. </p> <p>The state lost jobs for three consecutive years since the peak in 2000. There have been meagre job gains so far this year, but the state still has 217,000 fewer employed than in March 2001 when the nationwide recession officially began, a 3.9% drop. At the same point after the 1991 recession, the state had posted a 1.3% increase. At the current rate it will take Ohio six years to reach pre-recession levels of employment. </p> <p>\"There has been no previous recovery with this little job gain,\" says executive director of the thinktank, Amy Hanauer. \"Many of the jobs that have left Ohio are not coming back.\" </p> <p>At the same time, wages are getting lower, partly the result of the loss of good paying unionised factory jobs and growth in service sectors, the so-called \"Wal-Mart effect\". The median wage last year was $13.14 (\u00a37.15) an hour. Accounting for inflation, the median Ohio wage in 1979 was $13.44. </p> <p>Ohio is not alone in suffering. Michigan, with its high concentration of car plants, has had an even tougher time, while neighbouring Pennsylvania has also seen its manufacturing base affected by the double whammy of weak demand and competition from China. Anger over what is seen as Beijing's illegal manipulation of its currency is palpable. John Kerry's proposal to review all trade agreements within his first 120 days in office is popular in Ohio, not least because government figures show that between 1995 and 2004 52,265 jobs were lost in the state as the result of international trade. In truth, however, the loss of jobs in manufacturing is not new. Estimates suggest that 40% of the job losses have been the result of higher productivity, but even so the past four years have been especially tough. Manufacturing employment in the US has been cut from 17 million to 14 million and those that have survived have had to become leaner and - in many cases - meaner. </p> <p>Todd Weddell is president of a steel workers' local union in Niles, 60 miles south east of Cleveland. He and his 360 members have been locked out for a year after refusing to accept a 15% cut in their compensation package. Their employer, RMI Titanium, said it needed to save $3.5m from of its wage bill. \"The whole situation is totally grim,\" Weddell says. </p> <p><strong> How do we compete?</strong><br> </p> <p> Both Kerry and John Edwards have been on the picket line at Niles in one of their many visits during this knife-edge contest, but some of the steel workers are now looking for jobs that are likely to pay around half as much as the $16 an hour they were previously getting. If Kerry won, Weddell said, there would at least \"be someone in the White House who cared about working people in America\". </p> <p>Disappointment with Bush is not confined to organised labour. Steve Schler, president of Pro-Mold, which makes plastic moulds in Akron and has sales of $1.6m, said the downturn since the boom of the late 90s \"has been the worst that I have experienced. Prior to that I thought the early 1980s was the worst. </p> <p>\"We have felt competition from the far east - China, Taiwan, Korea. How do we compete? I haven't got a clue.\" </p> <p>The other significant issue facing ProMold, as it is facing workers themselves, is healthcare. Premiums are getting ever more expensive. In 2002, ProMold's premiums rose by 13%. Last year, the cost was 17% higher and this year 18% higher. The result has been to scale back coverage and make workers pay a higher portion of the costs. </p> <p>Ed Herman, the Republican candidate for Ohio's 10th district, including much of Cleveland, says Bush's ideas for tackling big structural problems such as social security and healthcare recognise that the world has moved on from the days of the industrial plants of the 30s and that a more individual approach is required. </p> <p>\"The Democrats' old tactic is class warfare and they do it effectively. It is a myth perpetuated that Republicans want to destroy the welfare system. That is not the case. The services are being expanded not shrunk and as that awareness spreads more people will consider themselves Republican.\" </p> <p>Zack Schiller, at Ohio Policy Matters, disagrees. While the president has directed tax cuts towards the wealthy and large corporations, the American working-class is feeling threatened, he says. \"Many welfare programmes are under attack. Medicaid [which helps poor people buy prescription drugs] will probably be cut back; they have lowered the threshold on subsidised childcare; they are trying to reduce housing subsidies. To an extent this election is a referendum on the welfare state.\" </p> <p>An outsider might have difficulty understanding why Ohio is even a swing state. But the Bush administration has been effective in directing attention away from the economy and making it instead about homeland security and social issues such as abortion and gay marriage. The president is more popular in the rural south of the state, but even in Cleveland, union organisers say 30% of their members vote Republican. </p> <p>John Ryan, who runs the local chapter of the AFL-CIO, the umbrella union organisation in the US, explains that many of his blue-collar members are Republican. \"We have devout Catholics or Christian right who have strong views on abortion or gun owners who want to own a bazooka.\" In the end, though, he believes that the mass registration campaign organised by the Democrats will win the state for Kerry. \"God and guns can't compete.\"</p> <p><strong>State of the nation's health: Plans and pledges</strong></p> <p><strong> Bush's first-term record </strong> In 2002, 75% of Americans were covered fully by health insurance, 44 million were not covered at all and 70 million either had no cover or were not covered for part of a year; those not covered were more likely to be children, young adults and Latinos; average healthcare costs are estimated to be $14,500 (\u00a37,800) per family by 2006 </p> <p><strong> Plans</strong> </p> <p><strong>Bush</strong> Tax credit of $700 per low income individual or $2,000 per family to help the uninsured; no change to drug pricing, which prevents imports of cheaper drugs because they could be tainted </p> <p><strong> Kerry</strong> Tax credits to make healthcare cheaper for small businesses, those near retirement and workers between jobs; use IT to cut red tape, saving $350bn annually; allow drug imports from Canada</p>",
  "Jose Manuel Barroso, the incoming European Commission president, is preparing to head off the prospect that MEPs will vote out his entire commission tomorrow with key concessions over his choice of a new justice chief. <p>It is understood that Mr Barroso is making clear to Socialist, Liberal and Green opponents that he has definitively stripped Rocco Buttiglione, the Italian Catholic and outspoken critic of gay and women's rights, of all civil liberties duties. </p> <p>But he will insist on retaining Mr Buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner. </p> <p>Senior colleagues yesterday indicated that the new president is also prepared to go further and agree to promote a new EU law banning all forms of discrimination on sexual, gender or religious grounds on a pan-European basis - a key demand of liberals and other critics. </p> <p>Mr Barroso will also pledge that the new commission, due to take office this weekend, will beef up the Vienna-based EU monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia. This will nominally become Mr Buttiglione's responsibility but will effectively come under the control of the commission president and senior colleagues. </p> <p>Last week Mr Barroso offered relatively minor, and confusing, concessions to his opponents over Mr Buttiglione, but raised the prospect of an institutional crisis within the EU by provoking the 200-strong Socialist group of MEPs to threaten to vote as a bloc against his whole team. </p> <p>The Liberal leader, Graham Watson, has urged him to go further or risk a majority vote among the 732 MEPs against him and his 24 colleagues. Last night Peter Mandelson, the new trade commissioner, said: \"I think we are on the way to finding a solution that should leave both sides happy. </p> <p>\"Parliament must be listened to and we have to show we understand its concerns but, equally, parliament cannot take a sledge hammer to this issue by insisting on the reconstruction of the commission.\" </p> <p>Mr Mandelson has lobbied leading Socialist MEPs in favour of a compromise in advance of tomorrow's vote. Intensive efforts to avert a full-blown crisis took place in Strasbourg last night and are to continue today. </p> <p>In Brussels, Romano Prodi, the outgoing commission president, said he and his team were prepared to carry on in a caretaker capacity if an emergency arose. \"I hate the idea, but we must be ready to step in.\"</p>",
  "Non-Iraqi prisoners caught by US forces in Iraq may no longer be treated under the protections of the Geneva convention, according to a report in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/26/politics/26detain.html?hp&amp;ex=1098849600&amp;en=625cd03fa770bac7&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage\">today's New York Times</a>. <p>Citing anonymous Bush administration officials, the report said that in recent months a new legal opinion has been reached that not all prisoners in Iraq should necessarily enjoy the full protections of the convention. </p> <p>Human rights groups fear that elements in the US military and intelligence leadership want to detain some prisoners outside the Geneva convention so they can attempt to obtain more information with harsher interrogation techniques.</p> <p>The reports follow a weekend story in the Washington Post that the CIA had secretly transferred a dozen non-Iraqi prisoners out of Iraq. It was not clear where they had been taken to, the paper said, but there was speculation they may have been transferred to allies of the US such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>In Geneva today, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which is guaranteed access to prisoners of war under the Geneva convention, said it could not confirm or deny the reports that prisoners had been moved, Reuters said. </p> <p>An ICRC spokeswoman told Reuters that regardless of whether the convention applied, all prisoners must be covered by some law whether it be international, Iraqi or American. She said: \"Some law has to apply. The important thing is not to detain people outside of any legal framework. That is what we have always said about Guant\u00e1namo.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office insisted that British forces were still beholden to the Geneva convention. A FO spokeswoman told Guardian Unlimited that a legal memorandum of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), which was still in force despite June's handover of power to the Iraqis, said that all detainees were protected by the fourth Geneva convention. </p> <p>The New York Times says that the new legal opinion about foreign combatants in Iraq followed an approach by the CIA to establish the legality of secret transfers of prisoners. </p> <p>US officials, including the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, have said in the past that all detainees in Iraq were protected by the convention which stipulates no prisoner should be moved to a hostile country.</p> <p>But the New York Times said that a new opinion represented a fresh consensus reached by lawyers from the departments of state and justice, as well as other agencies such as the Pentagon and the National Security Council. </p> <p>An official source quoted by the newspaper said officials had concluded \"not everyone who might be in Iraq after the occupation began is a protected person\" under the convention. </p> <p>The new opinion would mean those not protected could include foreign fighters including suspected members or sympathisers of al-Qaida or other terrorist groups. </p> <p>The new opinion would mean al-Qaida fighters detained in Iraq could potentially be transferred to the American base in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, where some 550 alleged \"illegal enemy combatants\" have been detained, most of them following the invasion of Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks in 2001. </p> <p>Recent reports suggest that there could be as many as 20,000 insurgents fighting US and coalition forces in Iraq. Last week a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London said that among these were perhaps 1,000 foreign \"jihadists\" who had entered Iraq to fight.</p> <p>Attacks by insurgents have increased in recent weeks, with a reported increase of 25% since the start of the Muslim holy-month of Ramadan. A major offensive by US marines on the insurgent stronghold of Falluja, a city west of Baghdad, is widely expected. </p> <p>Meanwhile today, an official from the Swedish government said a Swede held for more than two years at Guant\u00e1namo Bay will get financial help if he pursues his planned lawsuit against the United States.</p> <p>Mehdi-Muhammed Ghezali, a Swede of Algerian origin, was released in July without charge from the US naval base and plans to file a joint lawsuit together with other European prisoners who were released this summer.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Town</strong></p> <p>Brunel sells itself as a compromise between the lure of the big city and the effort it takes to live there. And true enough, its four west London locations - in Uxbridge, Runnymede, Twickenham and Osterley - are far enough away from the hustle and bustle to keep your blood pressure at manageable levels, while still allowing you to dash into the capital should you get overexcited by your latest copy of Time Out. The western reaches of London can be a delight, too. Syon, Osterley and Richmond Parks, Kew Gardens and the picturesque stretches of the Thames are lovely, and alleviate any sense of being stuck out in the sticks.</p> <p><strong>Gown</strong></p> <p>The main campus, Uxbridge, was the film set for Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Fortunately, it's no longer a vision of futuristic dystopia: the brutal architecture has been softened somewhat by landscaping and greenery.

Science professors and engineering researchers fare comparatively well, on \u00a352,000 and \u00a321,000 respectively.

  "Ready for your lifestyle health check-up? According to a leaked white paper on health this week, every patient in Britain is to be offered a personal health consultation - a body MOT - by their GP. Patients, apparently, will be followed up by email and a new service, Health Direct, will offer health promotion advice. <p>You might think it sounds like a fabulous new advance, but I, for one, feel deeply cynical. </p> <p>Superficially, offering people a check-up sounds good. Preventative medicine is, after all, the ideal. But in fact, we general practitioners have been sneakily doing this kind of lifestyle advice thing for ages - offering help to stop smoking, weight loss advice to those overweight, and sexual health advice - for example, where relevant, to use a condom along with the pill. It's been the kind of thing doctors have been opportunistically squeezing into consultations, and we know that some of this - for example, advice to stop smoking - does work. </p> <p>But offering people a separate appointment to discuss their lifestyle is different. My cynicism rests on my concern that the very people who are existing on junk food, smoking heavily, overweight or drinking dangerously are the least likely to come along for an appointment to talk about what they are doing and how best to improve on it. The truth is that most smokers do realise it isn't a very healthy addiction - after all, in the UK, tobacco kills 300 people a day - and most people know if they need to eat more fruit and vegetables. </p> <p>The real reason why some people have poor diets and smoke heavily is not one that can - or should - be easily medicalised. The problems run broader and deeper. Those most likely to come along for an MOT-style appointment are those who are highly motivated about their health - and probably don't need much help to stop smoking or change their diet anyway - if they need to at all. </p> <p>However, the other question is whether using doctors' and nurses' time purely to offer lifestyle advice is a good use of resources. For many years, the NHS has been grappling with the idea of \"evidence-based medicine\" - which in effect, means that we are meant to be using things that work and not using things that don't. While this isn't always possible - sometimes there simply is not the science to back up one treatment over another - it means that there is a bigger emphasis on using the limited resources of the NHS to best effect. This can only be a good thing. </p> <p>But I can't find any science behind this MOT idea - which is not part of the new GP contract. From what I can gather, general practices would have to be reimbursed separately for these health checks as an extra service. But since staff and time are all limited, the question for many may be - if we offer these appointments, then what will we not do instead? </p> <p>Of course, in an ideal world, we would know that this shift of resources would be worthwhile, because we would end up with a very healthy populace who would have less heart disease and cancer, thus balancing the books. Of course this is what I - and, I reckon, every other doctor in the country - would want: but the problem is that we seem about to pour in resources without knowing if giving out this kind of lifestyle advice in this way actually works. </p> <p>Take, for example, the Healthy Eating Line. This was a Scottish telephone advice service set up as part of a major advertising campaign - costing \u00a31.7m - to try to improve on the traditionally unhealthy Scottish diet. However, calls were so infrequent, that at one point, it cost \u00a3120 to fund just one call to the service. </p> <p>However, if this lifestyle advice was part of an investigation to find out how best to improve the long-term lifestyles of those people most likely to benefit, then I could see the point of it. This isn't likely to happen without direct targeting of patients. Offering a lifestyle check-up to everyone who wants one may not be the way to do it. </p> <p>The idea of targeting people most likely to benefit is behind the National Institute for Clinical Excellence's (Nice) new guidance on dental check-ups, due to be released tomorrow. From having the recommended six-monthly check ups, it seems that it will be now recommended that those with healthy teeth are to have fewer appointments, and those who have a history of gum disease or unhealthy teeth, more frequent appointments. This seems to make sense - the people who need most dental care get it, based on research. </p> <p>In 2002, the Audit Commission made what seems like a fairly rational judgment regarding how best to fund NHS dentistry. For example, they reported that 11% of the NHS family dental budget was spent on scaling and polishing. The commission noted: \"For most people this procedure is mainly of temporary cosmetic benefit, and rarely prevents or cures gum disease.\" </p> <p>Time and money have to be wisely spent. Crucially, however, Nice is recommending more research - fully supported by the British Dental Association - into how frequent check-ups should be. I don't see why an evidence-based approach should only apply to dentistry. The public shouldn't be expecting anything else.</p>",
  "<p>In Weybridge, Surrey, a 10-year-old boy sees a tutor to prepare him for the 11-plus. He stands a decent chance of passing and getting a place in a much favoured boys' grammar school across the border in Kingston-upon-Thames. But he won't now be sitting the 11-plus. His parents can't risk it because, paradoxically, a new system introduced in England to make school admissions clearer and fairer is actually working.</p> <p>Of course, it doesn't feel fairer to parents of 10- and 11-year-olds who are tearing their hair with anxiety about school choice at the moment. But, at least in theory, the new system will ensure that, on March 1 next year, more children will be offered a secondary school place that they and their parents find acceptable.</p> <p>It's a long way from the fable of parental choice, but it has to be better than the near anarchy that has beset the admissions process in some areas, most notoriously London, in recent years.</p> <p>But will it make parents happy and satisfied, or will they be left feeling fed-up and cheated - forced to compromise in a system where there are too few brilliant state schools and not enough good ones for everyone? Reports of confusion from some secondary school information evenings in London and its surrounding areas, with conflicting advice being given on what they should do, suggests there will be a lot of the latter about.</p> <p>\"It's what I predicted,\" says Barry Sheerman, Labour chairman of the education select committee, which damned the distress caused by the school admissions system in a report published in July. \"By being fairer, the new system is going to cause greater disappointment to the articulate people who were very clever at playing the old system, because they had the advantage of higher levels of knowledge, information and networks. It makes it much more difficult, if nigh on impossible, to play the system any more.\"</p> <p>Under new coordinated admissions arrangements being introduced for entry to secondary school from September next year, parents are able to express a preference to their local education authority for a minimum of three schools in rank order; some areas allow up to six selections. A computer program, run by the LEA, compares the applications with the vacancies and offers of places made on the basis of the published admissions criteria of individual schools. The LEA picks the highest-ranked offer and passes it on to the parents.</p> <p>The idea is that as many children as possible will receive one offer from their list of preferences on March 1 next year. This should end at a stroke a system that allowed parents to make multiple cross-council-border applications; receive multiple offers from schools in different local authorities; and sit on them, waiting to see if their favourite came up, because there wasn't a single national date for offers to be released. This left some children waiting for months without a place - one child's horde of offers was another child's no offers.</p> <p>It sounds simple, but it isn't. For a start, city technology colleges are outside the scheme, so that's one complication. Independent schools are also outside it.</p> <p>Then, there are two versions of the scheme running: one, known as equal preference (which ministers prefer), where the schools applied to do not know where they come in the parents' ranking order; the other, known as first preference, where they do. Most authorities are believed to be operating equal preference systems, but schools in Kent, Essex and Luton - including church schools and single-sex schools - have challenged this and demanded to know where parents have ranked them. In law, it appears, there is nothing to prevent them finding out.</p> <p>Surrey is one of the authorities operating first preference, the only one to do so of 41 LEAs that have joined together in a unique admissions group to act as a clearing house for school vacancies across London and the surrounding authorities. (It is, however, in the early stages of a consultation with schools and parents about equal preference.)</p> <p>A coordinated admissions scheme was the brainchild of Tim Brighouse, the commissioner for London schools, but gained general support across the capital's LEAs. A grant from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister paid for it to be set up as an \"experiment\", but now that the complicated software is in place - and assuming the system is seen to be fair - it seems unlikely it will not continue.</p> <p>Across the border from Surrey is Kingston-upon-Thames, home to the prestigious grammar school Tiffin boys'. George James, who runs his own IT company in Weybridge, and his wife decided last year that they would like their son to sit the 11-plus for entry to Tiffin. To this end, they hired a tutor to help him prepare.</p> <p>Their son is still going to the tutor but will not now be sitting the Tiffin entry test. This is because their second choice, after Tiffin, would be the well regarded, and oversubscribed, comprehensive local to their home, where their daughter is already a pupil.</p> <p>Because they are local and their son has a sibling at the school, they are virtually guaranteed a place for him - but only if they rank it first in their list. If they don't, the Surrey first preference scheme means the school will know it was ranked second and their son's application will be pushed behind those of people who made it their first choice.</p> <p>That wouldn't matter if he passed the 11-plus, but it would if he didn't. \"Then we would probably end up with our third choice, which is not a good school,\" says James. \"It's absolutely maddening that he is going to be denied a chance of trying for the grammar school when less good people may get a place because their parents are willing to take the risk, because they can afford to go private if they have to.</p> <p>\"I'm philosophically opposed to that, so I don't have that choice. I don't know whether I agree with the principle of selective education, but it is the system at the moment, so he should have the opportunity if it's there. For the rest of his life, the decision we take now could have a big impact on him - I'm not gambling with that.\"</p> <p>The Jameses are not alone. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), which includes grammar school teachers, has received reports about a reduction in the number of children being put forward for school selection tests for exactly this reason. But Mary Bousted, general secretary of the ATL, feels this has to be accepted to achieve more equity in the system.</p> <p>\"Last year, some children in London were not getting a place in a secondary school until the beginning of the academic year,\" she says. \"That is not in the interests of social justice, children's justice or the effective planning of secondary education. You have to weigh the benefits of this scheme with the losses.\"</p> <p>Ian Birnbaum, chair of the London schools admissions system and director of education for Sutton, which has a number of selective schools, has been in talks with Surrey over its decision to stick with the first preference system. He would like the government to tighten the rules so first preference is used only in exceptional circumstances. \"It sits very uneasily with a coordinated system,\" he says.</p> <p>A ministerial reply to the education select committee's call for more teeth in the admissions system code of conduct is imminent. Changes to legislation could be made in the Queen's speech. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education and Skills points out that the current admissions framework leaves scope for LEAs and schools to design the coordination scheme they feel best meets the needs of the local area: \"The coordinated admissions scheme will not affect the ability of foundation and voluntary-aided schools to consult on and determine their own admission arrangements. However, where LEAs or schools feel that 'first preference first' is not working in the best interests of local parents and children, they can object against operation of such criteria to the schools adjudicator, providing supporting evidence. The adjudicator can decide to rule out first preference first as an admission criterion if he decides that there is sufficient justification to do so.\"</p> <p>But even where equal preference is the order of the day, parents feel forced into making strategic choices, even more than they did with the uncoordinated system, under which they could end up with more than one offer. As one parent in London put it: \"You read the information booklets and after about five reads and numerous cold towels you think you understand it, and then you go to the school information evenings and you are told something completely different: 'if you don't put us first you haven't a hope of getting in'. It's complete confusion. Even the teachers don't seem to know what's happening.</p> <p>\"There was chaos in the past, but you were dealing directly with the schools and you could have more than one offer and assess them. I can see why there was a need to simplify and reform the system, but it's not feeling very comfortable being in the experimental year.\"</p> <p>But problematic as it is, something did have to give in the old admissions system. London, for example, has an acute shortage of secondary school places in certain boroughs and a particular shortage of high-quality secondary schools.</p> <p>Under the old system, some children might sit nearly a dozen entry tests in different boroughs. In Birmingham, children could sit up to a similar number because of the same urban proliferation of selective schools of all kinds. Brighouse, who was director of education for Birmingham before becoming the London schools tsar, tells a story of parents who accepted two offers of school places in London, purchased two sets of uniform and sent the child part-time to each to see which they preferred. \"It was picked up when the odd pattern of absence showed up,\" he says. \"Meanwhile, other kids have to wait for a place.</p> <p>\"It would be wrong if someone's strategic first preference denied the genuine first preference of someone else, but this is better than the old system. There was a lot of patent unfairness in that. It will be fairer and it is a first step towards improving a chaotic system.</p> <p>\"It doesn't, of course, address the admissions criteria of the schools and they are still the ones making the offers. I would say to parents, for God's sake, look at the admissions criteria, because you might choose five schools and not get a single offer because your child doesn't meet the criteria of any of those schools.\"</p> <p>He believes the new system will push up the number of appeals over secondary school allocation. Hertfordshire, which has been running an equal preference coordinated admissions scheme for the past three years, has seen its appeals rise, but then so has everywhere else - nationally, school appeals almost quadrupled in the 10 years to 2001. With league tables laying bare GCSE success rates for all to see, increasing numbers of parents have bent over backwards to get their children into - or keep them out of - certain schools.</p> <p>Competition for some schools is maniacal. Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College, a city technology college in Lewisham, south London, is thought to the most oversubscribed school in the country, with 2,000 children chasing just 200 places.</p> <p>Parents with the money rent or buy homes in the catchment areas of favoured schools, or dig out religious allegiances to make their children qualify for a faith-based school. Or they drag in spurious health issues to back their applications. The parents who don't seek to bend the rules - or don't know how to - can be left out in the cold.</p> <p>David Chaytor, Labour MP for Bury North and a member of the education select committee, says: \"The system that has been developing in recent years has put more and more emphasis on what we laughingly call parental choice. But it's a grand deceit. In reality, parents have only the right to express a preference, which is severely constrained at the end of the day. In secondary education, in many, many cases, it is the schools that choose the pupils.\"</p> <p>He would like to build a national system based on feeder primary schools, which is already done in some parts of the country. Crucially, he would like the feeder schools to be socially diverse, so a mix of pupils would qualify for entry to secondary schools, and the house price effect - houses in catchment areas of well-regarded schools being higher than those in otherwise similar neighbourhoods - would disappear.</p> <p>Cyril Taylor, chairman of the Specialist Schools Trust, believes the admissions nightmare will be alleviated by the proliferation of specialist schools. \"Most schools will be specialist schools by 2007 and that will change things, because more schools will be good. Specialist schools with a similar intake to community schools do better. Justice will only begin to work with admissions when there are fewer underperforming schools.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, parents would do well to heed the advice of Philip Hunter, the chief schools adjudicator. He would like them to be more realistic about the schools they apply for. He would also like LEAs to consult parents about the type of admission arrangements they prefer - he urged Calderdale to do it in one of his most recent decisions.</p> <p>\"Whatever system you have got, there is a market among schools,\" he says. \"Some will be oversubscribed and someone will have to decide which kids get in and which don't. In time, more and more of these problems will be ironed out. Admissions arrangements will become more out in the open and clear and objective.\" In time.</p>",
  "<p>Supermarket group Asda was today fined \u00a35,000 after admitting making illegal claims about the anti-cancer properties of its mangoes. </p> <p>The company, a subsidiary of US retail giant Wal-Mart, pleaded guilty to contravening two rules under the food labelling regulations 1996. </p> <p>Swindon borough council's trading standards department prosecuted the chain after one of its officers spotted a sign in a store in Swindon, Wiltshire while shopping last year. </p> <p>The sign read: \"Mangoes are a great source of vitamin C and beta-carotenes, which are good for healthy eyes and skin. Their anti-oxidant properties help to fight cancer.\" This contravened the regulations, which prohibit any labelling claiming that a food prevents, treats or cures a disease. </p> <p>Magistrates in Swindon fined the company the maximum penalty of \u00a35,000 and ordered it to pay \u00a31,140 in costs. </p> <p>Asda had argued it made a genuine mistake, did not mean to mislead customers and though words in the claim were illegal they were not untrue. </p> <p>The court heard that Swindon's senior trading standards officer Russell Sharland seized the \"point of sale\" sign and wrote to the company saying he was investigating the circumstances surrounding it. </p> <p>Phillip Wirth, for the council, said correspondence was \"ignored\" until the end of October when Asda's trading law manager, Gordon Madden, wrote to say the sign had been prepared by a company nutritionist to promote greater consumption of fruit and vegetables, in line with the government's \"five a day\" campaign of healthy eating. Mr Wirth said the case touched upon serious illness and individuals who suffer from these illnesses were \"particularly vulnerable members of our society\". </p> <p>For Asda, Nicholas Haggan QC said the sign was put up in error, having been written by a qualified company nutritionist but not approved by the company's trading standards team before publication. </p> <p>Though the wording had been emailed to the trading standards team, it was not immediately responded to. Mr Haggan admitted it was \"uncertain\" what happened next, but the decision was made to proceed to publish the sign without the necessary approval. </p> <p>The sign's wording was drawn to the attention of Mr Madden in January 2003 but Mr Haggan conceded \"no steps were made to recall the notice,\" and it remained in place until June. </p> <p>The lawyer said that it was \"a genuine mistake made in good faith\", and he believed Asda was \"morally blameless\" for its actions. </p> <p>He said the company had \"fallen foul of legislation never meant to be used to prosecute a responsible, respectable company such as Asda\" and argued it was not in the public interest to prosecute retailers over the promotion of healthy eating. </p> <p>But magistrate David Rogers said there had been a clear failure of quality control procedures over the publication of the sign, which he said was \"clearly misleading\". </p> <p>Outside court, a group of six Asda employees dressed as fruits demonstrated with banners which read \"Healthy Not Guilty\". </p> <p>Spokeswoman Rachel Fellows said: \"It seems crazy to us that you can state the specific benefits of eating plenty of fruit and vegetables and the undisputed benefits appear on department of health and food standards agency websites but that we cannot echo those statements in our stores. </p> <p>\"We would absolutely endorse that customers need to be protected from potion peddlers but we think this law goes too far. We don't think it's right that you can state exactly why you should eat lots of fruit and vegetables anywhere except the place where people want to buy them. That's why we think the law must change, and now.\" </p> <p>In a statement, the head of trading standards at Swindon borough council, Robert Taylour, said: \"Current government recommendations are that everyone should eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day to reduce the risks of cancer and coronary heart disease and many other chronic diseases. We fully support this message.</p> <p>\"However, in this instance the claim went beyond the message of prevention and suggested a treatment or cure. It is clearly unacceptable for the public to be misled in this way.\" </p>",
  "<p>Superstition is a pretty slippery concept, and we need to examine what we mean by it. The simple statement that a superstition is an irrational belief is quite adequate for most purposes, as long as we don't enquire too closely into the meaning of the word 'irrational'. But not every irrational belief gets labelled as superstition, so we need to look a bit closer. One of the key characteristics of superstition is a belief in the existence of luck, as a real force in life, and that luck can be predicted by signs, and can be controlled or influenced by particular actions or words. Other key elements include a belief in fate, which again can be predicted and manipulated, and a belief in fate, which again can only be described as magic - the idea that people can be harmed or protected by spells, charms, amulets, curses, witchcraft, and so on.</p> <p>Superstitions are also unofficial knowledge, in that they run counter to the official teachings of religion, school, science, and government, and this is precisely why - even in the 21st century - many of us like to hold onto a few, to show that we are not totally ruled by science and hard fact.</p> <p>The Pocket Guide To Superstitions is a book of historical research, the result of years of searching for examples of superstitions in every source we can think of - novels, plays, poetry, children's books, newspapers, magazines, diaries - going back as far as we can. We also listened to people on buses, on the radio, in the playground, in the supermarket, and so on, to learn what is being said and done now.</p> <p>We examined statements, and asked questions. It is frequently said, for example, that the fear of spilling salt goes back to the Last Supper and, to prove it, that Leonardo Da Vinci's painting of the event shows Judas spilling salt. But it doesn't. One piece of 'evidence' put forward to support the completely groundless idea that 'Ring a ring a roses' goes back to the plague is that sneezing was a main symptom of that disease. It wasn't. It turns out that Friday 13th is a Victorian invention. 'Touch wood', it is claimed, is based on a belief in tree spirits, but is there evidence we ever believed in tree spirits?</p> <p>What we ended up with was a mass of material on the subject, which was organised and analysed to provide data for informed judgements instead of guesses. The first principle of the historical approach is that if a superstition cannot be found before, say, 1850, the idea that it has survived from an ancient fertility ritual or pre-Christian sacrifice 1,200 years before seems a bit far-fetched. If it existed in that time, how come nobody noticed it? And if there is no evidence for its existence, how can we base our theory of origin on it? If it had existed underground for all that time it would probably have changed beyond all recognition anyway (imagine a game of Chinese whispers lasting for 1,200 years), so an examination of the modern version is unlikely to tell us anything about the original. Our historical approach enabled us to make estimates of the age, development, and relative popularity of particular beliefs, and start to make general statements about how superstitions function. Occasionally, our research also threw light on the question of how superstitions arose in the first place. </p> <p>One thing which became obvious when we compared a whole mass of reported superstitions was that most are based on a small number of principles which are repeated time and time again in different guises, and the formulae can tell us a great deal. The two most widespread, for example, are that you must not tempt fate (don't count your chickens before they're hatched) and that beginnings dictate the future course of events. The concern for good beginnings is reflected in the first-footing customs at New Year, giving a baby a coin to ensure future good fortune, getting out of bed on the correct side to start the day well, and so on. On the negative side, don't stumble as you leave the house, don't see an unlucky person on the way to your fishing boat, and so on. A third principle, far more complex if fully analysed, is that the natural world 'knows' what is going to happen in human life - a robin tapping at the window means a death in the house very soon; a dog howling at your door means the same.</p> <p>The world of superstition is essentially a symbolic one, although in most cases only on a very simple level. Money in the pocket at a key moment (for example, when hearing the first cuckoo in spring) stands for prosperity in the coming year, whereas an empty purse symbolises want. A piece of coal carried by a first footer represents warmth and comfort; an upturned bowl in a seafaring family stands for an upturned ship. This feeling for the symbolic is often little more than a weak pun - washing on certain days 'washes one of the family away', for example, or 'turn your chair to turn your luck'.</p> <p>Another conclusion that is clearly supported by a historical review is that we, as a society, are much less superstitious than we were 100, or even 50, years ago. Although few people (myself included) can claim to be completely free of superstition, many of us only play at it nowadays. This claim can be demonstrated in several different ways, most notably by asking someone to name 10 superstitions; most people will not be able to get beyond five without really thinking hard about it, whereas a century ago, the average person would have known dozens.</p> <p>Even those we still know are relatively colourless, being nearly always simply a matter of 'bad luck', whereas in the past they would have had more individual meanings - a death, you won't get married, a stranger is coming, and so on. Regional differences have been largely ironed out, and the same beliefs are found all over the country. But the real acid test is that however superstitious a person may think they are, few act on their superstitions in the way previous generations did. Who would accept being turned down for a job because they had red hair or the wrong sun sign? Who would phone work and say, \"I can't be in today because I saw a magpie as I left home\"? We might try a traditional cure like a key down the back for a nosebleed, but who would accept a verbal charm rather than hospital treatment to stop real bleeding? Who would tell a young mother that her baby will die if she weighs it, or lets it see its reflection in a mirror? And so on, through hundreds of different superstitions which were believed and acted upon only a century ago. </p> <p>But why were people so superstitious? It is usually assumed that superstition is the result of fear and uncertainty - an attempt to control the parts of life that are in fact beyond our understanding or control. This is largely true, and there is some evidence that superstition is more prevalent in people involved in dangerous occupations, and increases in times of particular uncertainty, such as during a war. But there are other forces involved. Superstitions are passed on from person to person, often within a family, and take on the authority of tradition. It must be said that, in the past, various people made a living out of their neighbour's willingness to believe in magical cures, love potions, and the need for protection against ill-wishing.</p> <p>The main reason for the decline of superstition in modern times is that many of these uncertainties have declined - whole areas of life, from the trivial to the life-threatening, have had the mystery and danger removed from them to a large extent. Childhood diseases still exist, and parents still have worries, but nothing compared with a century ago. Changes in everyday technology have brought almost instant death to many beliefs. The light-bulb and the radiator provide little scope for superstition, or romance, whereas the candle and the open fire had plenty. Baking bread, turning the bed, churning butter, washing by hand, sweeping the house, laying out a corpse n the front room, killing a pig - all these activities were highly charged with beliefs, but have changed beyond recognition, or disappeared from our lives completely. How many of us know the phases of the moon?</p> <p>It could be argued that superstitious impulses in society are not dead, but are simply resurfacing in the guise of alternative medicines, unofficial pick-and-mix religions, astrology, conspiracy theories, and new-age cults and gurus of various kinds. But one major area where most of us can claim to be less prone to irrational thinking is in the matter of witchcraft. However badly things are going, however ill we may feel, few would think that the cause was our neighbour's spite or the spells of a witch. In this area at least, people nowadays have more sense.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is an edited extract from A Pocket Guide to Superstitions of the British Isles, by Steve Roud, published by Penguin.</p>",
  "<p>Two senior judges today criticised a local education authority for pursuing all the way to the high court the parents of an emotionally-disturbed girl who said she was being bullied and refused to go to school. </p> <p>The London Borough of Sutton appealed to the high court against a refusal of local magistrates to convict the parents for failing \"without reasonable justification\" to ensure their daughter attended classes. </p> <p>The appeal by way of case stated was, however, rejected as \"hopeless\", and the judges heavily criticised Sutton education chiefs, saying the appeal should never have been brought. </p> <p>Wallington magistrates concluded in June last year that the parents of 14-year-old K, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were \"doing their best\" and acquitted them. </p> <p>K, who had become aggressive and violent towards her mother, had only attended her school 29 out of a possible 174 occasions between October 15 2002, and March 14 2003. She had not attended at all since December 2002. </p> <p>The magistrates were \"greatly disturbed\" about the seeming lack of early direct support from the authorities for the girl's serious emotional and educational problems and said these should be addressed as \"a matter of some urgency\". </p> <p>Today, Sutton's barrister, Tim Compton, faced an extraordinary heated barrage of criticism from two senior judges when he attempted to overturn the magistrates' decision. </p> <p>The judges appeared incensed that \"perfectly, reasonable parents\", who had obtained a good education for their other children up to university and A-level standard, had been put through the \"appalling\" ordeal of extended legal proceedings. </p> <p>Lord Justice Thomas said it had been \"perfectly proper\" to bring the prosecution, but, having lost, it was \"a monstrous injustice\" for Sutton to put the parents \"through this agony\" for the past year. </p> <p>The judge also said he was \"very, very concerned\" the safeguards that were supposed to be in place to protect parents from unjustified legal action under the 1996 Education Act might in fact be failing. </p> <p>Mr Compton told the court that the education authority had come to court seeking guidelines for future cases. </p> <p>But, when it came to judgment, Lord Justice Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Fulford, said: \"This appeal is completely and utterly hopeless and should never have been brought.\" </p> <p>The judge called for \"humanity\" to be shown to parents when education authorities consider bringing prosecutions that could result in prison sentences. </p> <p>It was not a case where the court had just to answer points of law in the abstract, but concerned \"the obvious distress\" of parents who, if the case went against them, were liable to suffer penal sanctions. </p> <p>\"It is important to stress the human factor when the opinions of this court are sought.\" </p> <p>At one point in the three-hour hearing, the 51-year-old mother, Mrs S, turned to confront the council's legal team and told them that, if she had had the money, she would have prosecuted them for the \"agony\" her family had been put through. </p> <p>She said: \"I would like to turn it round the other way and take them to court. We have been through utter hell. It is a disgrace. </p> <p>\"I did everything I could to get help. I asked the school, social services, and even the police for help. We only got a social worker on the day of the magistrates' court hearing. </p> <p>\"I think this case was an absolute shambles and I would not like anybody else to go through it.\" </p> <p>Later, outside court, she said: \"She [K, now 15] was a lovely girl before the bullying started. Now she is just at home and has no confidence to do anything and no friends. This has really brought her down and the family is split.\"</p>",
  "A majority of voters, especially women, are opposed to the government's plans to allow a new generation of mega-casinos to open in Britain, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published today. <p>The finding follows Tony Blair's uncompromising defence yesterday of the government's proposed gambling bill, insisting that it is \"90% about better regulation, better protection for children\" and the removal of existing slot machines from 6,000 high street premises where youngsters now play them. </p> <p>Faced with an outcry against a bill widely discussed for several years, the prime minister showed no sign of backing down on what he insisted is unavoidable modernisation - and regulation - of a fast-expanding industry which can also be used to help regenerate resorts such as Blackpool. </p> <p>But the ICM survey shows that the prime minister faces an uphill struggle, with only 34% of the public supporting his casino expansion plan against 53% who want to see it halted. </p> <p>There is, however, some evidence that the jibe by the culture secretary Tessa Jowell that her critics had a \"whiff of snobbery\" about them has some foundation, with the poll showing that her gambling bill is a popular measure among skilled working class voters and so does appeal to a key section of Labour's core vote. </p> <p>The poll confirms that Britain remains overwhelmingly a nation of gamblers, with 73% saying they have had a flutter in the past year. At present, the gambling legislation proposes a voluntary levy on the industry to fund charitable help for those who develop a chronic gambling habit. But the poll shows that 59% of the public want the government to go further and provide free NHS treatment in the same way that smokers and problem drinkers are given state help. </p> <p>The October ICM survey also shows strong support for the government's plans to relax the drinking laws so that pubs can stagger their closing times with 57% backing liberalisation and only 37% expressing disapproval. </p> <p>At the same time two-thirds of the public want to see smoking bans in all enclosed public places, including pubs, restaurants and offices. </p> <p>The results of the ICM poll suggest that voters reject claims that the Labour government is acting as some kind of \"state nanny\" when it tries to regulate the nation's smoking, drinking and gambling habits, with 61% regarding such regulation as necessary \"for the benefit of others\". </p> <p>Mr Blair justified the casino expansion plan yesterday at his monthly press conference saying that in return for a new gambling commission with powers to regulate the multi-billion pound industry \"we are giving the power to local authorities to grant planning permission for these larger leisure complexes, including casinos, which will probably add around about 20- 40 casinos to the 120 that there already are in this country\". </p> <p>Backbench Labour anger with the bill is intense. Critics predict that the casino element will be removed via a cross-party revolt. </p> <p>The Conservatives announced that they will vote against Ms Jowell's bill because it does not fulfil its original promise to \"protect children and the vulnerable\". The Liberal Democrats demanded stronger powers for local authorities to reject casino applications - something ministers say the bill provides. </p> <p>Mr Blair repeatedly said that he understands the concerns of his backbenchers. He said the bill would help keep organised crime out of UK casinos and derided as \"nonsense\" overnight claims that ministers have agreed to slash taxes on gambling - to a unified rate of 15-20%. Gambling interests are urging such a move to draw in investment and prevent it moving offshore. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between October 22-24, 2004.

  "Tony Blair should have been in a buoyant mood as he left the Downing Street state dining room at lunchtime yesterday after his first monthly press conference since his health scare. <p>For the first time in months, the hour-long exchange was not dominated by the two issues which have been the bane of No 10: splits with his chancellor and Iraq.</p> <p>In what should have been a dream scenario for the prime minister, who has desperately tried to focus on domestic politics, the first two questions were about gambling and asylum. But the prime minister appeared hesistant and struggled to explain the government's thinking on these two potent issues which could cause him grief in the run-up to the election. Unsettled by a Daily Mail campaign against his plans to liberalise the gambling rules, Mr Blair tried to explain that 90% of the changes would actually introduce better regulation.</p> <p>As he came up for air after explaining the gambling reforms, Mr Blair found himself on the defensive again as he was questioned about the weekend claim that Britain has abandoned its veto on asylum. His answer would have done Yes, Minister's Sir Humphrey Appleby proud. Nothing had changed because Britain still retained the right to keep its own border controls, he said. Where Britain decides to opt into pan-European measures, it will lose its veto. But ministers will choose which measures to accept and so the veto effectively remains in place.</p> <p>\"We will retain the absolute right not to participate, never mind not vetoing it, not to participate. Where we have decided to participate, where we take a decision that we want to participate so it is a measure we actually want Europe to do, then we can get it done more easily.\"</p> <p>Such a convoluted response dismayed loyal supporters of Mr Blair, who admit the prime minister is struggling to focus on domestic policies and is finding himself wrong-footed on issues he once mastered with ease. \"We are all out of practice because we are used to questions about Iraq and personality splits in government,\" one supporter said. \"What today showed is that Tony sometimes does not focus on issues, such as gambling, until late in the day.\"</p> <p>Aides say that the key theme Mr Blair will bang on about in the run-up to the election will be security. This is designed to marry the two concerns voters have at the moment: a worry that the world is less secure after 9/11 and alarm at the rise of anti-social behaviour back home.</p> <p>Mr Blair gave a taste of the importance he attaches to security when he kicked off the conference with an announcement that juries will next month have the right to know of previous convictions. \"I accept this is controversial,\" he said. \"There are people who believe this undermines the defendant's rights, but for too long the scales of justice have been weighted in the defendant's favour and against the victim.\"</p> <p>His remarks show that, with the Tories adopting an ever more strident approach on law and order, Labour will not concede an inch on such sensitive territory.</p> <p>The Queen's speech next month will include a range of measures to reassure voters that the government is tackling anti-social behaviour. But supporters admit it is dangerous to link Iraq with domestic security because British voters have never accepted the link between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein. One explained his thinking: \"Tony has now accepted that he cannot get away from Iraq because everyone is talking about it. The logic is to bring security back home.\"</p> <p>His message appears to have hit home after a leading supporter of the prime minister called for a \"small steps\" approach. David Miliband, schools standards minister who wrote Labour's last manifesto, said: \"This government has in the main gone for a small steps strategy [which] are actually making a big difference [rather] than a series of bold steps that would or wouldn't have worked. I think we should be confident therefore to stick with the strategy, which is to keep making changes that actually speak to people's lives.\"</p>",
  "Co-op workers in search of a pay rise went on strike yesterday and set up what may turn out to be some of the most restrained picket lines in recent trade union history. <p>They carried banners but lit no braziers and cut down on the slogans in an action designed to show both solidarity with the cause and sensitivity to the feelings of the public.</p> <p>\"We have been reasonably discreet,\" said trade unionist Derek Ormston, who helped organise the Scottish end of a national one-day strike by administrative staff, pall bearers and hearse drivers employed by Co-operative Funeralcare, which has branches throughout Britain.</p> <p>\"We have some placards just saying Transport and General Workers Union - official picket,\" said Mr Ormston, the T&amp;G's regional industrial organiser in Scotland.</p> <p>\"It's a delicate situation - we are not dealing with a factory that makes a can of beans but with human beings.\"</p> <p>Mr Ormston said pickets had gathered at more than a dozen of the Co-op's funeral parlours in Scotland.</p> <p>\"We do not want to unsettle members of the public during what is a stressful time for them anyway. We have stuck to the law and had six pickets at each site and we have concentrated on the main homes.\"</p> <p>Steven Inglis, funeral director and a T&amp;G branch secretary, went on strike with three colleagues from Funeralcare's Stirling branch, which was forced to close.</p> <p>\"The job itself offers great job satisfaction,\" he said. \"But we know that today people have been let down or had their plans postponed. You think about that at the back of your mind and there is a great deal of anxiety regarding that.</p> <p>\"We had no other option. It's a regrettable action but we have been forced into it by the reluctance of the management to improve on their position.\"</p> <p>Other Co-op workers set up pickets in London and some regional centres in a move to win a pay rise bigger than the 3.5% offer they have rejected.</p> <p>A Co-operative Funeralcare spokesman said that almost 80% of its staff, most of them members of the union Usdaw, had already accepted the pay deal and its commitment to a review of working hours.</p>",
  "<p>India took three late wickets on the first day of the first Test after a brilliant Damien Martyn century had put Austalia in control in Nagpur.</p> <p>The tourists had seemed on course for an immense total with Martyn - who was eventually out for 114 - occupying the crease, but his dismissal sparked a mini-collapse. Michael Clarke stabilised the ship, but day one ended more evenly than the home team had dared expected.</p> <p>The Indians had had mixed fortunes before the game started, with Sachin Tendulkar declaring himself fit to return to the fold after a six-month absence, but skipper Sourav Ganguly, Irfan Pathan and Harbhajan Singh ruled out.</p> <p>Batsman Rahul Dravid took over the captaincy, but promptly lost the toss as Adam Gilchrist elected to bat first.</p> <p>That seemed a wise decision as Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden provided a solid foundation on a good pitch, putting on 67 for the first wicket.</p> <p>But left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan broke the partnership when he had Hayden caught behind for 23, and Langer soon followed his partner back to the pavilion when he edged Khan to Dravid in the slips for 44.</p> <p>Anil Kumble then dismissed Simon Katich for four when he inside-edged the spinner straight to Aakash Chopra at short leg.</p> <p>That brought Darren Lehmann to the middle with Martyn, a partnership that was to prove very fruitful for Australia. The pair safely survived until lunch, and then launched a series of devastating strokes in the afternoon session in a partnership of 148.</p> <p>Lehmann, though, was in some discomfort with a hamstring strain, requiring Hayden to act as a runner. After twice being dropped, his luck eventually ran out when he was caught by Dravid off the bowling of Murali Kartik just before tea.</p> <p>Martyn brought up his hundred after the interval, continuing his elegant knock with some fluent drives. He was ably supported by Clarke, the duo putting on 80 for the fifth wicket before Martyn was finally out, caught in the deep off Kumble's bowling.</p> <p>Australia then lost Gilchrist and Shane Warne in quick succession to give Partik his second and third wickets - Gilchrist caught and bowled, and Warne stumped by Parthiv Patel - to provide India with a huge boast before the close.</p>",
  "Downing Street today signalled a willingness to live with an amendment proposed by pro-hunting peers which would ensure a future for foxhunting, albeit under a licensing scheme. <p>Questioned about the amendment to the hunting bill due to be debated in the Lords this afternoon, Tony Blair's official spokesman declined to confirm that the government would use the Parliament Act to push through a complete ban.</p> <p>MPs voted last month for a complete ban of hunting with hounds, amending a government \"compromise\" bill to that effect. </p> <p>Ministers had been seeking to introduce legislation to license hunting, establishing a regulator to test whether hunts where excessively cruel and without the merit of controlling the fox population. </p> <p>Pro-hunting peers from all the main three parties are today seeking to amend the hunting bill to restate the government's initial plan, defying government threats to use the Parliament Act to enforce the will of the Commons.</p> <p>Asked about today's vote, Mr Blair's spokesman said: \"Let us wait and see what the House of Lords does, but the prime minister has not changed his view at any point that it would be better if a compromise is agreed.\"</p> <p>Lord Donoughue, a Labour peer who is moving the amendment, this morning said there was a \"reasonable chance of getting this through because we had a majority of more than 300 for the 'middle way' option [licensed hunting] when that was voted on.\"</p> <p>The rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, said at the weekend that he hoped the issue could be resolved in a less confrontational way, and urged peers to engage with the Hunting bill by proposing changes to the all-out ban approved by the Commons which could at least be considered by MPs.</p> <p>But he acknowledged any amendments proposed by peers would still face opposition in the Commons, which has repeatedly voted by large majorities for a ban.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, anti-hunting Labour MP Tony Banks said: \"Having not been prepared to tackle licensed hunting the last time it was offered to them, to go back to it now is quite clearly a waste of time and, honestly, it is the last throw of fairly desperate people.</p> <p>\"In the end, the matter really at issue is whether or not the elected house will prevail over the unelected house.</p> <p>\"Whatever they come up with today, if it is less than a total ban, it will be unacceptable to the House of Commons.\"</p>",
  "<p>Councils are deliberately refusing to accept genuinely vulnerable people as homeless because they do not have the homes or resources to help them, housing lawyers have warned MPs.</p> <p>The Housing Law Practitioners Association (HLPA) is calling for the law to be changed to prevent councils failing in their duty to help homeless people.</p> <p>The move comes as a new report shows that a 'bottleneck' caused by a shortage of council accommodation is preventing many people living in London's hostels from finding a permanent home.</p> <p>In written evidence to a select committee inquiry into homelessness which opens today, the association complained that a \"lottery\" was operating on decisions about homeless applications.</p> <p>It explained that since it was so difficult to challenge council decisions on homelessness cases, a number of authorities were getting away with turning down deserving homeless applications because they do not have the homes to cope.</p> <p>Speaking to SocietyGuardian.co.uk, barrister David Watkinson said: \"We can see that in some parts of the country you are much more likely to get favourable housing applications than in other parts - and it seems to be related to the availability of housing. It's most acute in central London.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The Homelessness Act gives local authorities a wide range of discretion in dealing with homeless applications. And they are also under resource pressure because of the decline in housing stock and conditions.\"</p> <p>Mr Watkinson, who is convenor of the HLPA's law reform committee, added: \"Without a change in the law this unfairness will continue.\"</p> <p>Under the current law, if councils refuse to accept someone as homeless, the applicant can only appeal to the council itself to review that decision. If they are still refused housing they can only appeal to the courts on a point of law and not on the merits of the case. </p> <p>And the shortage of social housing in London is trapping homeless people in a \"bottleneck\" of temporary accommodation, according to new figures from St Mungo's.</p> <p>Up to a third of the estimated 2,474 people living in the capital's homeless hostels cannot move out because there is nowhere suitable for them to go, the charity said. In some cases people are remaining in hostels for 16 months.</p> <p>The survey found that 34% of residents across eight London hostels were awaiting vacancies, a projected total of 841 residents.</p> <p>Hostels are usually the first step off the streets for long-term homeless people, and most expect to move on after six months.</p> <p>But the survey found that the average stay across all hostels was 303 days, almost double that time, with some hostels averaging 477 days. Some individuals had been residents for even longer.</p> <p>The charity, which surveyed a sample of 434 residents, estimated that over 800 homes would need to be built or made available to clear what it called a \"bottleneck\" of former rough sleepers. </p> <p>Homes would not necessarily be individual flats, as some residents would need support or shared accommodation before living independently.</p>",
  "<p>New fathers need more government cash to enable them to afford to take paternity leave, research suggested today. </p> <p>The survey, which researchers said had implications for the government's future family-friendly policies, found less than half (46%) of fathers said they would take paternity leave if they had another child. </p> <p>Fathers are currently entitled to up to two weeks' paid leave which, according to the DTI, is set at \u00a3102.80 a week or 90% of average weekly earnings if this is less than \u00a3102.80. </p> <p>But the research for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and Hammonds solicitors found four out of five fathers would take up their statutory leave if paternity pay increased to 90% of full pay. </p> <p>And 87% said they would take up paternity pay if they got full pay. </p> <p>Duncan Brown, assistant director general at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: \"We would have expected the rate of paternity pay to be one of the factors in the decision to take paternity leave. </p> <p>\"But with less than half of fathers willing to consider taking leave at the current \u00a3102.80 a week, and four out of five wanting to take up the opportunity at 90% of full pay, the implications for any further family-friendly legislation are clear. </p> <p>\"Flexible employment policies are becoming embedded in the UK world of work. But fathers tell us they can't afford to spend time with their newborn children at current rates of paternity pay.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the DTI said figures for the take-up of paternity pay would be available next year, but the low rate could be due to the scale of pay or could be \"a cultural issue, with many fathers in the workplace still not seen as having a legitimate role in childcare\". </p> <p>The research comes as the trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, warns today at the gender and work summit at Downing Street that getting rid of \"career sexism\" is vital to closing the pay gap between men and women. </p> <p>According to the Equal Opportunities Commission, the pay gap between men and women stands at 19%.</p>",
  "<p>Labour backbench discontent with the \"toothless\" watchdog on university admissions is surfacing as ministers try to reassure Oxbridge and other elite institutions it will not interfere with how they pick their students. </p> <p>Yesterday the Conservatives tried to exploit Labour divisions and set up Offa - the Office for Fair Access - as an election issue. Their debate in the Commons provoked a flurry of reassurances from the higher education minister, Kim Howells, to universities and ended by passing an anodyne government amendment that stressed the universities' freedom to set their own admissions policies. </p> <p>The concessions prompted Barry Sheerman, Labour chairman of the Commons education committee, to call it the equivalent of \"a meal in the Atheneum discussing shortcomings with a vice-chancellor\". He told the minister: \"I think the message will get across that it is not quite what some Labour members expected when it was first mooted and when their votes were needed in the top-up fees debate. That is to be brutally honest; it seemed to be part of the package, but we have moved away from that.\" </p> <p>MPs voted for an amended motion that agreed that it is for institutions themselves to decide how to implement the principles of the Schwartz report on fair access, and notes that the most powerful driver of increased participation is to raise standards in schools - rather than action by universities themselves. </p> <p>\"Universities' admissions policies will be outside Offa's remit,\" it added. Today Mr Sheerman said Offa, as described by the minister, looked \"totally toothless\" and added: \"Given it's present toothlessness, it is not surprising that some colleagues will be disappointed.\" He said it was not clear that Offa would be able to do act even if a university or group of universities had appalling procedures. </p> <p>But the Conservatives argued that the powers of Offa could result in fines of millions of pounds if they were found to have breached their agreements because under the new law they can be made to repay all their fee income. And John Maples, Tory MP for Stratford-on-Avon, launched a strong personal attack on the newly appointed director of Offa, Sir Martin Harris, the former vice-chancellor of Manchester University. </p> <p>He said ministers might have performed a \"clever trick\" by persuading Labour backbenchers to vote for tuition fees on the grounds that they would interfere in the admissions process, \"and then produced this toothless tiger to reassure people such as me\". </p> <p>He added that unfortunately the government then appointed \"a real old, hoary left-winger to run Offa. That was presumably to reassure the people who had become unassured by the lack of teeth in the tiger. I was provoked to get involved in the debate by the remark by Sir Martin Harris, who said: 'class underlies almost all the inequalities and unfairnesses in our system'. </p> <p>\"Do people like that still exist? The government must have found that guy in some intellectual Jurassic park. Apart from anything else, I thought that new Labour had abolished people who thought like that; I thought that that was not allowed any more. I find it unbelievable that a serious academic, the vice-chancellor of one of our universities, appointed to this job by the government, can actually think like that.\"</p>",

  "Victim support groups today called for clarification of the law after a burglar shot during a raid on a farmhouse was jailed for seven years while the farmer who fired at him was backed by a judge. <p>Derby Crown Court heard how John Rae, 22, had targeted 73-year-old Kenneth Faulkner's isolated home three times last year before the pensioner hit back. </p> <p>Mr Faulkner's treatment contrasted with the prosecution of Tony Martin, who was jailed for the manslaughter of a burglar at his isolated Norfolk farmhouse seven years ago. </p> <p>Mr Martin served two-thirds of his five-year sentence for killing 16-year-old Fred Barras before being freed in July last year. </p> <p>His conviction provoked a tide of public sympathy and his supporters said the 58-year-old should not have been jailed for protecting his property. </p> <p>Today, victim support organisations called for clearer guidelines for householders on what constitutes \"reasonable force\" when protecting their homes against intruders. </p> <p>Norman Brennan, director of the Victims of Crime Trust, backed Mr Faulkner. </p> <p>He said: \"The law does not need changing, it just needs to be explained in layman's terms to the public about what reasonable force can they use to protect themselves, their families and their homes. </p> <p>\"Every householder has the right to protect themselves and their property and the law says that they can use what force they believe is necessary. </p> <p>\"The law is on the side of the householder, not the criminal.\" </p> <p>Victim Support spokesman Andrew Buckingham said: \"We would not condone people taking the law into their own hands. </p> <p>\"The law says you are allowed to use reasonable force, but the Home Office itself says there is a lot of confusion about what is reasonable force. </p> <p>\"As a law-abiding organisation, we believe that home-owners should follow the letter of the law but the home is the one place you expect to feel safe. </p> <p>\"When there is confusion to what reasonable force is, coupled with residents' anger at being targeted, it makes for a very complex set of circumstances.\" </p> <p>Describing Rae as \"an absolute menace\", Judge Andrew Hamilton said Mr Faulkner \"could not be criticised\" for defending his home at Ockbrook, Derbyshire. </p> <p>Rae, of Stanton by Dale, suffered a pellet wound to the leg when he was shot while returning to steal from the property for the third time. </p> <p>Mr Faulkner was originally questioned by police but the Crown Prosecution Service later ruled no charges should be brought against him after deciding he had been acting \"in legitimate defence\" of his property. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Derby Crown Prosecution Service said: \"The decision was not taken lightly, only after a thorough review of all the available evidence and careful consideration of the specific circumstances of this case. </p> <p>\"I would suggest that our decision was reached only after taking into account the particular circumstances of this incident. </p> <p>\"It does not mean that anyone using violence against an intruder is above the law and would not face prosecution.\" </p> <p>Derby Crown Court heard yesterday how Rae had taken an array of weapons and a mechanical digger from the farm. </p> <p>During the first raid, in July 2003, he and two other men broke into a gun cabinet and took five shotguns, a longbow, arrows, a crossbow and bolts. </p> <p>Rae alone then returned early in August, when he took a mechanical digger from Mr Faulkner's garage. He returned the next day but this time his victim was armed. </p> <p>Mr Faulkner fired at the intruder in a bid to frighten him away, the court heard - but ended up shooting him in the leg. </p> <p>Rae admitted three offences of burglary and one of burglary with intent at the farm as a result of his three raids. </p> <p>Passing sentence, Judge Hamilton said Mr Faulkner had lost his wife, was 73 years old and had been burgled twice before. </p> <p>It was \"very sensible\", he said, for the pensioner to take out a shotgun when he heard an intruder in his home. </p> <p>\"For him, it has been a most harassing and terrible incident,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>You can call it an estate car if you like, but people in the know prefer to think of it as a BMW 5 Series Touring, with the emphasis on the \"Touring\". Who can blame them? We all know, deep down, that the word \"estate\", when appended to the name of a car, tends to come across like a sigh of resignation, interchangeable with other words such as \"compromise\" and \"sensible\". </p> <p>\"Touring\", on the other hand, appears to have something of the alpine air in its hair. It smacks of freedom, the open road, baggage-free adventure in unchartered regions, and all those other things one has generally drawn a thick line under by the time one buys an estate car. In a BMW 5 Series, we are not merely going to the dump to dispose of our sacks of garden waste - we are touring. </p> <p>OK, so it's not a perfect verbal fit. But we need a term to set this sophisticated and life-enhancing slab of German engineering apart from all those other cars with big boots. \"Touring\" will have to do. </p> <p>It's not often an estate car shows any interest in gladdening the heart. Most of them are too busy fulfilling their roles as glorified wheelbarrows to have time for flirtation and witty repartee. As long as they have seats and a steering wheel, stop and start when told to, and come with a tailgate that doesn't take your head off on the way up, nobody much complains. </p> <p>The 5 Series, however, even while boasting a load-space of 500 litres and enough airbags to quiet the most eagerly cosseting parent, generously and heroically retains at least a vestigial interest in stirring your soul, or regions thereabouts. This is partly a matter of the car's undeniably dinky body panels - a sexy arrangement of convex and concave surfaces in the new, rather superior BMW style. (It seems to be the mission of all new generation BMWs to resemble, in so far as is possible within EU regulations, the Batmobile.) </p> <p>Couple this with the way the tailgate folds around into the sides of the car and it is fairly clear that we are not merely looking at a saloon on to the back of which someone has hammered a tea chest. Still more engaging is the confidence-inducing way in which the car handles - by no means a given in a vehicle roughly the shape and length of a hearse. I drove an automatic 530d - the turbo-charged, three-litre diesel version - which was so frugal it almost seemed embarrassed about asking me for fuel, yet which, at the same time, gave that sense one gets from a good BMW saloon that one is driving a spongier, more buttock-pampering sports car. </p> <p>The refinements in this case are BMW's Dynamic Drive system, some electronic stabilising gear (first used on the 7 Series), and active steering that alters the amount of tug needed to work the steering wheel in relation to the speed at which the car is travelling. The combined effect of these gizmos makes it possible to motor unflinchingly through sharp corners without necessarily having to see, in your wing-mirror, the unnerving sight of your own rear end pulling out to overtake you. </p> <p>The car is now in its third generation, and, in keeping with broader developments in the evolution of motoring, the new model is taller, wider and longer than the outgoing one, and therefore potentially just that little bit more difficult to park. That said, mine came with BMW's parking distance control system. </p> <p>The system is both audio and visual, with a colour diagram appearing on the central screen on the dashboard, showing the car surrounded by a range of zones, darkening from green to red as those menacing stationary objects grow nearer. Meanwhile a bleeper gibbers away with increasing nervousness. (Contrast the soothing, almost therapeutic harp sound the car makes when you attempt to leave it without switching its headlights off.) </p> <p>What with the general sense of electronically generated panic, it is a bit like being beckoned into a space by Corporal Jones from Dad's Army. My feeling, having tested the system extensively in a city environment, is that if you trusted completely in the PDC's paranoid verdict on what constitutes too close for comfort, you would never find a space big enough to park in and would be forced to drive around in circles until you ran out of petrol. </p> <p>Fortunately, there is an off-button on the dashboard for anyone willing to fly solo and help revive the ancient and increasingly neglected art of reverse-parking in urban conditions. </p> <p>The interior of the BMW 5 Series Touring, as is traditional with the company, takes the form of a small symposium on leather and ergonomics. Even the boot has been expensively upholstered. </p> <p>It was with some guilt that I put a dog in it. And it was with some reluctance that the dog eventually returned to live in the house. But that is the Touring lifestyle. It gets a hold on you and won't let go. </p> <p><strong>The lowdown</strong><br>BMW 530d Touring</p> <p><strong>Price:</strong> \u00a333,930 <br><strong>Top speed:</strong> 151mph <br><strong>Acceleration:</strong> 0-62mph in 7.4 seconds <br><strong>Consumption:</strong> 39.2mpg (combined) <br><strong>At the wheel:</strong> Boswell <br><strong>On the stereo:</strong> BBC Radio 6 <br><strong>En route for:</strong> The Western Isles</p>",

  "The redeployment of British forces in Iraq to support a US assault on Falluja marks another stage in a creeping return to the colonial era, when popular revolts against occupation were routinely suppressed by overwhelming force. These past episodes, revealed in declassified British government files, provide numerous parallels with Iraq, and suggest a pattern of future blunders and atrocities. Those in Britain who like to regard more recent military interventions as humanitarian might dwell on those parallels as the latest phase of the Iraq war unfolds. <p>British ministers' claim to be defending civilisation against barbarity in Iraq finds a powerful echo in 1950s Kenya, when Britain sought to smash an uprising against colonial rule. Yet, while the British media and political class expressed horror at the tactics of the Mau Mau, the worst abuses were committed by the occupiers. The colonial police used methods like slicing off ears, flogging until death and pouring paraffin over suspects who were then set alight. </p> <p>British forces killed around 10,000 Kenyans during the Mau Mau campaign, compared with the 600 deaths among the colonial forces and European civilians. Some British battalions kept scoreboards recording kills, and gave \u00a35 rewards for the first sub-unit to kill an insurgent, whose hands were often chopped off to make fingerprinting easier. \"Free fire zones\" were set up, where any African could be shot on sight. </p> <p>As opposition to British rule intensified, brutal \"resettlement\" operations, which led to the deaths of tens of thousands, forced around 90,000 into detention camps. In this 1950s version of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, forced labour and beatings were systematic and disease rampant. Former camp officers described \"short rations, overwork, brutality and flogging\" and \"Japanese methods of torture\". </p> <p>Guerrillas resisting British rule were routinely designated \"terrorists\", as now in Iraq. Britain never admitted that it was opposing a popular, nationalist rebellion in Kenya. Similarly, leftwing Malayan insurgents fighting British rule in the 1950s had strong popular support among the Chinese community but were officially called \"terrorists\". In secret, however, Foreign Office correspondence described the war as being fought \"in defence of [the] rubber industry\", then controlled by British and European companies. </p> <p>But under the banner of fighting communism, British forces were given free rein in Malaya. Collective punishments were inflicted on villages for aiding insurgents. A shoot-to-kill policy was promoted, tens of thousands of people were removed into \"new villages\" and used as cheap labour, and British soldiers had themselves photographed holding guerrillas' decapitated heads. The idea that the revolt was ended through \"winning hearts and minds\" is a myth; it was crushed by overwhelming force, such as massive aerial bombing. </p> <p>The brutality needed to be kept secret, a key theme in suppressing revolts. After Britain intervened to crush a rebellion in Oman in 1957, an internal Foreign Office minute stated that \"we want to avoid the RAF killing Arabs if possible, especially as there will be newspaper correspondents on the spot\". The British army commander in Oman later noted that \"great pains were taken throughout the Command to keep all operational actions out of the press\". </p> <p>The reason for this was that Britain committed numerous war crimes in Oman, including the systematic bombing of civilian targets such as water supplies and farms. These attacks \"would deter dissident villages from gathering their crops\" and ensure \"denial of water\", officials stated in private. Bombing was intended to \"show the population the power of weapons at our disposal\" and to convince them that \"resistance will be fruitless and lead only to hardship\". </p> <p>Britain was defending an extremely repressive regime where smoking in public, playing football and talking to anyone for more than 15 minutes were banned. Yet Harold Macmillan told President Eisenhower in a 1957 telegram that \"we believe that the sultan is a true friend to the west and is doing his best for his people\". </p> <p>As Blair and Bush claim to support democracy in Iraq, it is as well to remember that London and Washington have almost always opposed popular, democratic forces in the Middle East, preferring strong regimes capable of bringing \"order\". </p> <p>Britain's stance on the US war in Vietnam offers other useful lessons. Just as Tony Blair poses as providing a brake on US tactics in Iraq, Harold Wilson claimed to do the same over Vietnam. Yet Britain secretly backed the US in every stage of military escalation. </p> <p>In July 1965, when the US doubled its ground troop numbers in Vietnam, Wilson privately reassured President Johnson of his support for US policies \"in the interests of peace and stability\". </p> <p>The Wilson-Johnson correspondence highlights a shocking level of connivance between No 10 and the White House to deceive the public. When the US first bombed Hanoi and Haiphong in June 1966, Wilson issued a statement disassociating the government from the bombing. Yet this statement had been passed to the US for approval while Wilson assured Johnson that \"I cannot see that there is any change in your basic position that I could urge on you.\" The myth in Iraq that Britain is not complicit in US brutalities has its precedent in Vietnam. Declassified files show that, in 1962, Britain covertly sent an SAS team to south Vietnam under \"temporary civilian status\", to help train soldiers of the dictatorial regime of President Diem. Britain secretly provided arms and intelligence support to the US to improve US bombing. </p> <p>Moreover, brutal US \"counter-insurgency\" programmes were based on prototypes developed by British advisers. Britain's \"Delta Plan\" for the south Vietnamese regime, described by the Foreign Office as intended \"to dominate, control and win over the population\" in rural areas, became the US \"strategic hamlets\" programme, which forced millions of Vietnamese peasants into fortified villages that resembled concentration camps. </p> <p>As in Iraq, the publicly proclaimed search for peace was largely a charade. A senior Foreign Office official wrote in 1965: \"The government are fighting a continuous rearguard action to preserve British diplomatic support for American policy in Vietnam. They can only get away with this by constantly emphasising that our objective, and that of the Americans, is a negotiated settlement\". </p> <p>These episodes highlight the gulf between what ministers have told the public and what they have understood to be the case in private. The declassified secret files point to some harsh truths about current policy in Iraq: that the war is not about what our leaders say it is (democracy), is not primarily against who they say it is (terrorists) and is not being conducted for whom they say it is (Iraqis). </p> <p>Iraqis are in practice regarded as \"unpeople\" whose deaths matter little in the pursuit of western power; the major block on committing atrocities is the fear of being exposed and ministers will do all they can to cover them up. The public is the major threat to their strategy, which explains why they resort to public deception campaigns. If, as must be expected, atrocities now multiply in Iraq - with Britain complicit - we cannot claim we were not warned. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Mark Curtis' new book, Unpeople: Britain's Secret Human Rights Abuses, is published next month by Vintage. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mcurtis30@aol.com\">mcurtis30@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday October 27, 2004</b> <br> In the report below, we say that President Mbeki criticised \"bigots\" who regard black people as \"sub-human disease-carriers\". Mr Mbeki did not use these words, though the infelicitous addition of quote marks in an editing stage suggested he did so. What he said was that people \"whose minds have been corrupted by the disease of racism\" accused black people of being \"diseased, corrupt, violent, amoral, sexually depraved, animalistic\". <p>President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa has caused a race row by making a scathing attack on white people who link HIV/Aids to the alleged promiscuous and predatory behaviour of black Africans. </p> <p>Mr Mbeki turned a parliamentary debate on HIV and rape into a broadside against \"bigots\" who he said regarded black people as \"sub-human disease-carriers\". </p> <p>The president was asked about his silence on a pandemic which infects 5.6 million South Africans, more than in any other country, and replied that the real issue was prejudice, which endured a decade after apartheid. </p> <p>\"I will not keep quiet while others whose minds have been corrupted by the disease of racism accuse us, the black people of South Africa, Africa and the world, as being, by virtue of our Africanness and skin colour, lazy, liars, foul-smelling, diseased, corrupt, violent, amoral, sexually depraved, animalistic, savage and rapist.\" </p> <p>Using language which disconcerted some of his own supporters, Mr Mbeki said certain white people regarded black people as \"rampant sexual beasts, unable to control our urges, unable to keep our legs crossed, unable to keep it in our pants.\" </p> <p>The main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said the comments were a a disgrace which made false accusations of racism, and the president was ignoring a disease estimated to kill at least 600 South Africans every day. </p> <p>Since succeeding Nelson Mandela as president in 1999 Mr Mbeki has queried the connection between HIV and Aids and the safety of anti-retroviral drugs, citing research by dissident scientists who have suggested that the disease is not transmitted by sexual contact. </p> <p>Critics said he had fallen for crank theories, and after a wave of protest inside and outside South Africa he announced that he would \"withdraw\" from the debate. </p> <p>The government started a national treatment programme earlier this year but the target of treating 53,000 people by March has slipped, prompting lobby groups to complain about a lack of urgency. </p> <p>Earlier this month Mr Mbeki broke his silence and edged back into the controversy in a column on the African National Congress party website which lambasted white commentators for complaining about high rates of sexual violence. </p> <p>Official statistics showed that serious crime was falling, he said, but people who were racist and wanted the country to fail falsely claimed South Africa was the world's rape capital. </p> <p>This prompted the opposition to table written parliamentary questions about the extent of rape and its contribution to the spread of HIV. </p> <p>In reply Mr Mbeki said he would not discuss Aids but would stick to the central issue, which was the bigotry that thrived a decade after the end of white minority rule. </p> <p>\"Millions of Africans in our country, in Africa and the world did not fight against apartheid racism and white domination to create space for them to continue to be subjected to dehumanising, demeaning and insulting racism,\" he said. </p> <p>Tony Leon, leader of the largely white Democratic Alliance, said Mr Mbeki had ducked a simple yes-or-no question about whether he was prepared to lead the fight against HIV/Aids. </p> <p>\"Instead ... he recited a litany of racist caricatures that bordered on the pornographic and implied that the DA believed them.\" He accused the state broadcaster, SABC, of editing reports of the debate to spare Mr Mbeki embarrassment. </p> <p>The Johannesburg paper the Sunday Times said Mr Mbeki had reason to harp on race, but his \"rising anger\" had prompted hyperbole and \"unpresidential venom\" which demeaned the debate. </p> <p>\"For a man who claims membership of the African intelligentsia, that is a crass representation of the challenge we face as a nation seeking redemption after a history of unspeakable bigotry,\" it said.</p>",
  "<p>We're used to seeing credits for set and lighting designers in theatre programmes, but how often does someone get a mention for the violence? Denis Agnew - for it is he - brings a very credible level of violence to Roxana Silbert's production of A Whistle in the Dark. It is the debut work by Tom Murphy, in which a family of five Irish brothers bring their vicious and ultimately self-destructive values to bear on early-1960s Coventry. </p> <p>In truth, the violence is attributable to no one but Murphy himself. Written in 1961, the play is an unromantic study of the Irish expat. It shows these men as brutish, regressive and inward-looking, carrying with them an us-against-the-world sense of identity that is equal parts aggression, hypocrisy and self-hatred. Initially the Abbey Theatre rejected it, claiming the characters \"did not exist\", according to the director, Ernest Blythe. But sadly, they are all too real. And one reason the play works so well today is that it stands for the experience of not just the Irish emigrant, but anyone who strikes out on their own in spite of their social background. </p> <p>Michael Carney (Dermot Kerrigan) is the elder brother who has left home to marry an English girl in an effort to better himself. When the family follow him, he counters their tribal belligerence with a soft-spoken pacifism - only to appear feeble and disloyal. </p> <p>Those social bonds are so strong, argues Murphy, that they will damage anyone who tries to break them. His anger manifests itself in a brutal drama that exposes the bullying, sexism, sentimentality and tribalism of this male world to uncomfortable effect. </p> <p>If Silbert's production misses some of the period precision of Conall Morrison's staging at the Abbey in 2001, it still pulses with a raw energy thanks to electrifying performances from Cal MacAninch, Damian Kearney and Ciaran McIntyre as the Arthur Miller-esque father. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until November 13.

  "<p>Entrepreneurial flair is alive and well according to a new survey that shows more than two-thirds of A-level students would consider setting up their own business, and that many already have the \"big idea\" they hope will make them their millions.</p> <p>Nearly 70% of sixth-formers said they would consider starting their own company after they finish in full-time education, and almost a fifth said they were studying with the specific intention of going it alone. Almost a third of those asked said they already had an innovative business idea that they were keen to explore.</p> <p>However, among university students the reality of debt appears to catch up with the most aspiring entrepreneurs. Just one in 10 undergraduates said they intended to set up their own business.</p> <p>The findings were contained in a report from NatWest, following a survey that asked more than 3,000 graduates, current students and sixth-formers about their views on student life and their career aspirations.</p> <p>Respondents identified the desire for independence and the possibility of earning more money as the key reasons for wanting to go it alone after they finished in full time education. </p> <p>Budding Richard Bransons also said they were not afraid of the hard work involved in being their own boss. Some 69% said they expected to dedicate more than eight hours a day to making their business a success, with men more likely to put in these hours. And nearly half of sixth-formers thought they would take fewer than 20 days holiday a year when they were paying their own wages.</p> <p>Students also knew how they would spend the fruits of their labour. Both sixth-formers and current students favoured using the money their business might afford them to work more flexible hours. Current students who hope to run their own business were also keen to buy a new property as a reward for making their business a success.</p> <p>The head of student banking at NatWest, Ann-Marie Blake, said the survey results were encouraging. \"Young people are our future and it's great that so many are actively thinking about starting their own businesses because that will bring new ideas and fresh blood to drive the British economy,\" she said.</p> <p>\"It's also good to see that young people have an appreciation that starting your own business can be hard work, with money scarce and holidays few and far between at the outset.\"</p> <p>Ms Blake added that the drop in the number of students expecting to start their own business between sixth-form and university was probably a reaction to debt. \"The focus in the years immediately after graduation is around repaying the debt accrued during your study. And with the level of graduate debt being as high as it currently is, I think a lot of people realise that starting their own business is something they will have to do in the future.\"</p> <p>James Faulkner, who recently graduated from Cambridge University, said he hoped to set up his own business in the future, but realised why many students were hesitant to do upon leaving university.</p> <p>\"I've always wanted to run my own business because of the freedom it gives you to control your own destiny,\" he said. \"But at university you build up debts and realise just how incredibly difficult running your own company can be. You feel that you really have to get a job and put your plans on the back burner for a while; the only problem is that back-up plan can become very comfortable and spiral until you're in a stable position, which it's very difficult to leave.\"</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>WINNER AND LOSERS STOKE GAMBLING FEARS</b></p> <p>The Wrap doubts that William Hill is taking bets on the likelihood of the gambling bill clearing parliament. But the chances of this piece of legislation becoming law are looking worse every day.</p> <p>The Daily Mail, which is energetically pursuing its Kill The Casinos Bill campaign, enlists Michael Winner to the cause. \"Mumsy died broke. She was literally hooked on casinos,\" the director explains. Winner's mother, he writes, lost GBP35m in the casino at Cannes. \"It was supposed to have been my inheritance,\" he adds regretfully.</p> <p>According to the Times, Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary, is already being urged by her cabinet colleagues to establish a cap on the number of new casinos or restrict them to five or six zones. But Tony Blair defended the bill at his monthly press conference yesterday. \"Denying he gambled himself, except politically, Mr Blair said 24-hour gambling was a fact of life in Britain, whether it was horses, dogs, football pools or on the internet,\" the Telegraph reports. He spoke of \"20 to 40\" new casinos and said they would be confined to areas in need of regeneration.</p> <p>The Guardian weighs in with a poll suggesting that just over half of voters (53%) oppose new casinos, with a third in favour. \"There is, however, some evidence that the jibe by the culture secretary that her critics had a 'whiff of snobbery' about them has some foundation, with the poll showing that her gambling bill is a popular measure among skilled working class voters.\" Seventy-three percent of Britons \"have had a flutter\" in the past year, it emerges.</p> <p>\"'Snobbery' is the panic-button word of Labour ministers,\" writes Max Hastings in the paper. \"The casinos bill troubles many of us for the same reason as the national lottery ... I love opera and ballet and the great collections. But I feel a twinge of bourgeois discomfort that the money for upgrading our arts institutions has come from people least able to afford it ... The more 'accessible' gambling becomes, the more likely it is that ordinary families will suffer temptations and miseries that can prove crippling to their happiness, and are best kept as inaccessible as possible. The casinos bill stinks.\"</p> <p>Nonsense, says David Aaronovitch: the debate over the merits of a few more casinos is beginning to take on the characteristics of a \"moral panic\". \"It's unlikely that the Mail and the Guardian - when they agree with each other - will be right.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gambling/story/0,15248,1336129,00.html\">Public rejects Blair's casino plans</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1335841,00.html\">David Aaronovitch</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1335925,00.html\">Max Hastings</a> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1329261,00.html\">Times: Chaos over casinos</a> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/26/nbets26.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/10/26/ixhome.html\">Telegraph: Blair stands firm</a></p> <p><b>KERRY GAINING PACE</b></p> <p>\"The unmistakable sense yesterday was that Mr Kerry had the wind in his sails, pulling slightly ahead or closing in some of the most important states,\" reports the Telegraph.

  "I've just spent Saturday night helping the police with their enquiries. Not that I had done anything wrong. I had arranged to go out on a tour of duty with the evening shift based in Didcot. I knew that it would give me the chance to see what sort of problems the police in this part of the world have to face. <p>This sort of thing is, of course, all the rage with Conservative politicians. Only a few weeks ago, Michael Howard toured the streets of Brixton. He encountered little trouble (and no policemen). Though he was mugged on his way home - by The Guardian's Polly Toynbee. Now that Polly's lot are in power, she will brook no criticism of the forces of law and order.</p> <p>South Oxfordshire is not quite Brixton, but there is still huge concern about crime in this part of the world. Just to put you in the picture. Didcot lies within the Thames Valley Police area. The police station at Didcot covers an area of more than a hundred square miles. The police there look after Didcot, Wallingford and Berinsfield, as well as all the villages in the surrounding area. In Didcot in recent weeks there has been a shooting, a rape and several serious woundings. People in the area complain about an increase in anti-social behaviour. And they also worry that they do not see enough police on the streets.</p> <p>They are right to be concerned. In Didcot (and Wallingford, and Berinsfield, and the villages ...), on a typical Saturday night, there are just six police officers. Six. It is a thin blue line. So I was a little nervous before my patrol. I had been out before with the police, many years ago, in Bristol. As I set out to walk through St Paul's the young policeman turned to me and said: \"I'm a little bit nervous, this is the first time I've been here on my own.\"</p> <p>I needn't have worried this time. The six officers I met were of the highest quality. I was genuinely impressed by their professional, calm approach. Most of them grew up in the area, and they know their patch extremely well. Their chief constable, Peter Neyroud, should be proud of them. But he knows that his resources are stretched thin. Thames Valley Police competes with the Met. A police officer living in Didcot can earn \u00a310,000 more working in London, and benefit from free rail travel. Not only are there few police officers, the number of special constables has declined as well, down from around 20 to just five.</p> <p>I spent the evening touring the area in a transit van. It was a quiet night. The police were helped by the weather - cold and rainy - which tends to reduce trouble. Nevertheless, I saw for myself what so many constituents complain to me about. Low-level anti-social behaviour. A typical example was a group of four lads wandering through the streets of Wallingford. They stopped our van - and asked for a lift to Didcot. When we passed them again, they greeted us with a few casual insults.</p> <p>While the police I was with took the trouble to chat with the lads and to show them that there was a police presence in the area, there was little more they could do. With a few more police, they might have forced them to go home, or even arrested them. That may sound harsh, but it is what is needed. In our market towns there is a growing problem with low-level anti-social behaviour. It will get worse unless we tackle it.</p> <p>In Wallingford, the community has stepped in. Simon Harrop, a town councillor, has organised a group of volunteers to patrol the town once a week. Although they have no powers, they wear official yellow jackets. They engage local teenagers in conversation and let them know they are being watched. The initiative is backed by the excellent town mayor, Theresa Jordan, and her feisty predecessor, Betty Atkins. When I went out with the volunteers last Wednesday night - all burly men - we came across Theresa and Betty already hard at work admonishing a group of teenagers for rowdy behaviour.</p> <p>I hope the Wallingford volunteers continue their hard work. Even if we get more police, it is important for a community to be involved in supervising itself in this way.</p> <p>What more can be done? Conservative-controlled South Oxfordshire council has recruited community wardens to support the police, and is installing CCTV in Wallingford and Didcot. And for the first time, special constables will be paid - \u00a31000, about seven times less than a retained firefighter or a county councillor.</p> <p>My visit proved to me that Conservative policy is going down the right road. We do need more police officers, so it is absolutely right that we should be pledging to recruit 40,000 more over the next eight years.</p> <p>We do need to reduce the burden of paperwork. I was delighted to find that all the Police officers I spoke to had heard Michael Howard's pledge to cut the new form that officers have to fill in every time they stop someone - and that they supported it. Thames Valley police officers have just succeeded in stopping another new form - one to show that you are filling in all the other forms correctly!</p> <p>Like any public service, the police service breeds bureaucrats - people to monitor police work, and people the monitor the monitors. It is a cliche but it is true. The men and women who join the police do so to serve the public. One step change we could make immediately is to reduce their paperwork burden and let them get on with the job.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ed Vaizey is Conservative parliamentary candidate for Wantage</p>",
  "<p>There have been no shortage of insane, over ambitious ideas on the internet. Most of them never make it further than the pub they are conceived in. Some generate hype but quickly fall flat on their face. Others survive, but prove to be minnows rather than the giants they set out to be. However, every so often, one sneaks through. </p> <p>Wikipedia is one of the rare ones that made it. Even by the admission of its founder, the 38-year-old technology entrepreneur Jimmy Wales, it was a \"completely insane idea\": a free online encyclopedia that anyone can contribute to and anyone can edit. There is no editor, no army of proof readers and fact checkers; in fact, no full-time staff at all. It is, in other words, about as far from the traditional idea of an encyclopedia as you can get. </p> <p>There are dozens of reasons why it shouldn't work, and it is still far from perfect, but in less than four years, it has grown to have more than 1 million entries written in 100 languages from Albanian to Zulu. </p> <p>To its fans, it is a fantastic research resource - albeit one that you should use with caution; and an incredible example of what can be achieved by collaboration and cooperation over the internet. To its detractors - mostly those from the traditional world of encyclopedias and librarianship, it is barely worthy of the label \"encyclopedia\". </p> <p>To put Wikipedia's achievements in numerical context, at the same time it was celebrating the publishing of its one millionth entry (a Hebrew article on the Kazakhstan flag) in less than four years, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography launched its latest edition. It had taken 12 years to complete, yet contained a comparatively tiddly 55,000 biographies. It also cost some \u00a325m to create. Wikipedia has so far been bankrolled by Wales, but the total cost so far is still around \u00a3300,000. </p> <p>The current Encyclopedia Britannica has 44m words of text. Wikipedia already has more than 250m words in it. Britannica's most recent edition has 65,000 entries in print and 75,000 entries online. Wikipedia's English site has some 360,000 entries and is growing every day. </p> <p>But numbers mean nothing if the quality is no good. And this is where the arguments start. </p> <p>\"Theoretically, it's a lovely idea,\" says librarian and internet consultant Philip Bradley, \"but practically, I wouldn't use it; and I'm not aware of a single librarian who would. The main problem is the lack of authority. With printed publications, the publishers have to ensure that their data is reliable, as their livelihood depends on it. But with something like this, all that goes out the window.\" </p> <p>Wales responds by acknowledging that Wikipedia's model leaves it anything but error free (something they make clear on the site) but he also points to an article in a German technology magazine this month, which compares Wikipedia with two established, traditional digital encyclopedias: Brockhaus and Microsoft's Encarta. All three were tested on breadth, depth, and comprehensibility of content, ease of searching, and quality of multimedia content. Wikipedia won hands down. </p> <p>Dan Gillmor, the Silicon Valley commentator and author of We the Media, is one of many independent fans: \"I don't think anyone is saying Wikipedia is an absolute replacement for a traditional encyclopedia. But in the topics I know something about, I've found Wikipedia to be as accurate as any other source I've found. </p> <p>The roots of Wikipedia lie in the open source software movement, which took off in the early 90s with the development of Linux, a free version of the Unix computer operating system. This was developed in the mid-90s and posted on to the net, giving anyone the right to adapt and improve it. It has become the only real challenger to Microsoft's dominance of the market. </p> <p>The programmer and author Eric Raymond analysed the Linux phenomenon in his 1997 paper, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, which has since become the manifesto for the open source movement. Raymond compared the traditional school of software development to cathedrals, which meant they were \"carefully crafted, by individual wizards or small bands of mages (magicians) working in splendid isolation\". </p> <p>The open source community he wrote, \"seemed to resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches ... out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles.\" </p> <p>The critical law of the bazaar school of publishing, Raymond claimed, was that \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\". And this is at the heart of how Wikipedia works. Because it has so many people swarming over it all the time errors and abuses of the system are all quickly picked up. </p> <p>Indeed, research by IBM showed that acts of \"vandalism\" (ie people deliberately writing either rubbish or abusive comments) were normally cleared from the site within five minutes. </p> <p>For example, at 23.23 on September 27 this year, a user under the name Hitler edited the entry on Judaism by proposing that it be put forward for a \"Vote For Deletion\" (ie it should be removed entirely from Wikipedia). He summarised his edit as \"HOLOCAUST LOL\" (Laughing Out Loud). At 23.29 another user removed this from the page. And at 23.44, \"Hitler\" was been banned indefinitely from using the site. </p> <p>But, this isn't always the case. One blogger, who goes under the name of Frozen North, made a point of deliberately making a number of minor errors on a number of entries at the start of September. He made five changes and it took at least 20 hours for them to be changed. Some of his implanted errors were there for five days before he removed them himself. </p> <p>As Wales admits: \"The average quality of the entries is pretty good, but on any given day, any given entry might be up or down.\" </p> <p>The truth is that Wikipedia is continuously evolving. There are now around 3,000 new entries being added each day (about 700-800 of which are in English); and as the site has got bigger, so has the amount of editing that takes place on it. In September this year, there were an average of 11 edits per article. The entry on the Israel-Palestinian conflict has been edited more than 250 times this year alone. </p> <p>The most contested entry, though, is that of George Bush, which has caused so much controversy that it has been frozen from editing. It had had more than 500 edits between August and the start of October, and there are more than 13 pages of discussion about the entry. </p> <p>The truth is that Wikipedia reveals what is normally hidden in an encyclopedia: the countless decisions that lie behind each entry. The only difference is that in Wikipedia, the decision-making never stops and the debates are often robust to say the least. </p> <p>Wales says an entry in his encyclopedia is \"like a sausage: you might like the taste of it, but you don't necessarily want to see how it's made\". </p> <p>It might seem like anarchy. And, given the lack of central control, it technically is. However, there are three elements that make it work. </p> <p>The first is its ownership, and lack of commercial imperative. The site is manned by volunteers, and now owned by a foundation, which means people willingly give their time and intellectual property to the venture. It manages to run on less than $100,000 a year. </p> <p>The second is that the overriding editorial principle that all articles should show a \"Neutral point of view\" (NpoV). According to Wales, this is as much \"a social technique for getting people to work together\" as it is an editorial policy. </p> <p>The third - and perhaps most critical - has been the evolution of an incredibly intricate and democratic social order to keep this vast sprawling project in order. </p> <p>There are hundreds of thousands of \"Wikipedians\" who have contributed or edited articles. But the core community, according to Wales, is about 200 people who, by now, know each other quite well. Outside this inner-inner circle is a core of about 2,000 people who make more than 100 edits each in the last month. Beyond this, you have around 10,000 people who will have made more than five edits. There are administrators, bureaucrats, stewards and developers all with different levels of technical and administrative authority. </p> <p>Where individuals get into a dispute, such as an \"edit war\" where they are constantly undoing each others changes, or just an endless debate over a particular point, they can hold a vote on the issue. If this doesn't work, there is a formal mediation process, and if this fails, the case can go to an arbitration committee. In very extreme cases, Wales himself intervenes in his role as \"benign dictator\". </p> <p>Random acts of violence - such as Hitler's activities above - are not a major problem, ac cording to Wales, because they are clear to spot and obvious to redeem. </p> <p>\"When someone just writes 'fuck, fuck, fuck', we just fix it, laugh and move on,\" he says, \"but the difficult social issues, are the borderline cases - people who do some good work, but who are also a pain in the neck.\" </p> <p>One such case was a contributor called Wik. \"He violated some rules, but he also had a lot of supporters, so there was a huge debate over what we should do. Eventually, the arbitration committee decided he should be banned for a week.\" </p> <p>There are rewards as well as punishments. Those who have done good work - either for editing, or for dealing with vandalism - are awarded \"BarnStars\" to put on their profile page. </p> <p>This entire order is all there for everyone to see online. Policies and strategies are posted online, discussed and voted on. While the content develops automatically and anarchically, nothing happens to the social structure of Wikipedia without the consent of the core community. </p> <p>All of this, however, fails to impress their rivals over at Encyclopedia Britannica. During a 20-minute conference call, two of their most senior editors and their head of publicity, acknowledge that Wikipedia is a remarkable phenomenon, before getting their knives out. </p> <p>Executive editor, Ted Pappas, is the most extreme in his criticism: \"The premise of Wikipedia is that continuous improvement will lead to perfection, that premise is completely unproven ... with many of the pieces you don't know who it's written by, and who the administrators are ... one of the administrators over seeing the political coverage openly encourages people to vote for John Kerry ... 30,000 articles were created by a bot [an automated program that goes round causing havoc] ... hyperlinks, bulletpoints and cut-and-paste press releases do not an encyclopedia entry make.\" </p> <p>Editor-in-chief Dale Hoiberg is no less damning: \"People write on things they're interested in, and so many subjects don't get covered; and news events get covered in great detail. The entry on Hurricane Frances is five times the length of that on Chinese art, and the entry on Coronation Street is twice as long as the article on Tony Blair.\" </p> <p>Wales is quite sanguine when confronted with this assault. Pointing out that Wikipedia is still less than four years old and still improving. And, that he is looking at new techniques to improve the quality. </p> <p>His current plan is to create a \"stable version\" of some entries: in other words, one that has been fact-checked by one of a number of approved editors (although they are still working on the details of this). It is a radical change, but Wales is willing to do whatever it takes to give his project the authority it needs. </p> <p>The truth is that Wikipedia is far from finished, but even now, flaws and all, it is already one of the wonders of the digital age; and a pin-up for a growing movement that sees the internet evolving as a true \"citizens' medium\". However, Wales and his community of volunteers are not resting on their laurels. He is in negotiations to print part of the content, and distribute it in Africa as part of their ambition to \"put a free encyclopedia in the hands of every person on the planet\". Insane and over-ambitious? Definitely. But after everything they have achieved in the last three-and-a-half years, you would be equally insane to bet against them.</p>",
  "<p>The battle to win control of Warner Chilcott, the maker of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies, intensified yesterday when it announced a third takeover approach valuing the company at \u00a31.5bn. </p> <p>The latest bid is understood to have come from a consortium of private equity firms associated with Goldman Sachs, The Blackstone Group and Texas Pacific. </p> <p>Shares in the Northern Irish-based drug maker - formerly known as Galen Holdings - rose 2% to 834p but they have already risen 30% over the last three months after a series of other approaches. </p> <p>\"The company confirms it has received an approach from a party concerning an offer at a price of 837p per ordinary share subject to certain pre-conditions,\" a statement said. </p> <p>A successful takeover would bring windfall profits to chairman John King and his finance director, Geoffrey Elliot, who have been with the company for a combined period of 36 years. Mr King stands to gain more than \u00a3100m and Mr Elliot more than \u00a340m, but previous approaches have come to nothing. </p> <p>Yesterday Robin Gilbert, an analyst with stockbroker Numis Securities, advised investors to buy WC shares up to \u00a310 but Jonathan Senior, at Evolution Securities, urged sell for fear takeover discussions fail. </p> <p>WC has been through a transformation in recent years with the original Galen being sold to former chairman Allen McClay, who has also sold his holdings in what is is now WC. The name change to Warner Chilcott came when the US unit was acquired in 2000. WC now employs 120 staff in Britain and Ireland, 510 in America and 300 in Puerto Rico. </p> <p>The two other bidding groups talking to the WC board are believed to involve first, the Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and Thomas H Lee; and second, Credit Suisse First Boston's private equity arm and JP Morgan Partners.</p>",
  "Six descendants of the original mutineers on the Bounty were found guilty yesterday of 32 sexual assault offences in one of the last and remotest outposts of the British empire. <p>The month-long trial, conducted under British and Pitcairn flags in the island's whitewashed courtroom, was only sporadically attended by the islanders, many of whom regarded it from the outset as an unwelcome imposition. </p> <p>\"The outcome comes as no surprise to us,\" one of them, Mike Warren, wrote in an email yesterday. </p> <p>\"We believe this whole thing was a setup from the beginning, and no matter how well the defence argued the case they were fighting a losing battle.\" </p> <p>The six all claim descent from the men who settled on Pitcairn, which lies 4,000 miles east of New Zealand and 4,000 west of South America, after the infamous 1789 mutiny. </p> <p>The mayor, Steve Christian, 50, and his son Randy, 28, sweated profusely in the subtropical heat as they were found guilty on 14 counts of rape and indecent assault. </p> <p>Steve Christian was found guilty of five rapes on girls as young as 11, Randy of four rapes and five indecent assaults. </p> <p>Steve Christian's brother-in-law Dave Brown, 46, entered the court with laughter but left in tears after he was found guilty on six charges of indecent assault, in addition to three indecency charges to which he had already pleaded guilty. </p> <p>Steve Christian's father-in-law Len Brown, 78, was found guilty of two rapes dating back to the 1960s, and Terry Young and Dennis Christian were found guilty of 10 rapes and indecent assaults. </p> <p>In all, 32 of the 55 charges brought to trial received guilty verdicts. Only the island magistrate Jay Warren was cleared of all charges. </p> <p>Kari Young, a Norwegian-born Pitcairner currently living in New Zealand, said they had expected the verdicts but were still disappointed. </p> <p>\"I think it's quite a blow to actually have the rubber-stamp of child-molester,\" she told the Guardian. She insisted that the allegations of rape and indecent assault appeared different to Pitcairn islanders. </p> <p>\"Nobody believes that these girls were raped time and time again. There was a sex culture on the island, but nobody molested girls.\" </p> <p>Robert Vinson, the Kent police officer who led the investigation, disagreed. \"These judgments today have sent a clear message that the abuse of children is not acceptable in any culture anywhere, and Pitcairn Island is no exception,\" he said outside the court. </p> <p>The trial has revealed almost as much about the tense divisions in the three extended families who make up most of Pitcairn's population of 47. </p> <p>Several of them who were expected to give evidence withdrew their statements and gave an informal press conference when journalists arrived on the island to say that there was nothing wrong with Pitcairn's culture of under-age sex. </p> <p>The men convicted yesterday are due to be sentenced on Thursday, but the proceedings will remain subject to appeal. </p> <p>Legal argument about the status of the trial may continue well into next year. Two separate cases will argue that Pitcairners never properly incorporated British laws into their own legal codes. </p> <p>None of the victims of abuse still live on the island; they testified by video link from the northern New Zealand city of Auckland. </p> <p>A police officer who told the eight women of the verdicts said they had welcomed the outcome. </p> <p>\"They were all extremely relieved - as if a lifetime of emotional turmoil has been concluded,\" PC Karen Vaughan told TVNZ. </p> <p>\"Some were overwhelmed, but on the whole they feel justice has been done.\"</p>",
  "Spain's Roman Catholic church has in effect placed itself in the frontline of political opposition to Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's six month-old government by calling the first major demonstration to protest against its plans to introduce gay marriage, make divorce and abortion easier and amend religious education in schools. <p>The demonstration, to be held in Madrid in December, is part of the church's attempt to build a grassroots movement against the government's social reforms. </p> <p>According to church documents published in Spanish newspapers yesterday, letter-writing campaigns and petitions are being organised through its national network of dioceses and parishes. </p> <p>\"In the month of December there will be a great demonstration in Madrid, called by all the dioceses and Christian movements, associations and groups,\" said a letter from the archbishopric of Alc\u00e1la de Henares, 30 miles from Madrid. </p> <p>The demonstration would concentrate on \"the family, life and education\". </p> <p>It went on to accuse Mr Zapatero's government of doing \"little negotiating\" with the church on its future plans. </p> <p>The government has already scrapped an education bill approved by the previous, conservative People's party government which would have made religious education a compulsory exam subject for Spanish school children. </p> <p>Although Mr Zapatero's government has not yet said exactly what plans it has for religious education, it has indicated that schools will still offer non-compulsory religion classes by teachers appointed by Roman Catholic bishops but paid by the state. </p> <p>It has also proposed that religious classes may be taught by people from other churches or religions. </p> <p>It also wants to introduce a new compulsory subject called \"education in citizenship\" to teach \"democratic values\". </p> <p>Church leaders have argued that the new subject may be used to turn students away from the church or to \"indoctrinate\" them in the government's own beliefs. </p> <p>A recent opinion poll for the leftwing Cadena Ser station said 61% of Spaniards supported the government's most controversial new measure, the legalisation of gay marriage. </p> <p>And 72% said the Roman Catholic church, which currently receives an estimated \u20ac140m (\u00a395m) from state coffers, should be left to finance itself. </p> <p>Among the reforms being prepared by the government is one to give other Christian churches - Anglicans and other Protestants - and Jews and Muslims some of the privileges currently enjoyed exclusively by the Roman Catholic church. Although some Protestant church leaders have welcomed this, a spokesman for the archbishopric of Alc\u00e1la de Henares said that other confessions would be joining the protest. </p> <p>\"There are others who are worried about some of the measures too,\" he said. </p> <p>Yesterday Cardinal Renato Martino, president of the pontifical council for justice and peace, dismissed accusations that the church interfered with social issues. </p> <p>\"The church ... is really the one which defends the secular nature of the state, urging all to render to God what is God's and to Caesar what is Caesar's,\" he said in Rome. </p> <p>His comments came as the Vatican published a 525-page work on the social teaching of John Paul II and other recent popes intended as a handbook for the guidance of, among others, politicians. </p> <p>In one of the most robust denunciations ever, the Vatican described abortion as a \"horrendous crime\" and a \"particularly serious moral disorder\". It told Catholics that they had \"a grave duty of conscience not to cooperate, not even formally, in practices which, although permitted by civil legislation, are contrary to the law of God.\" </p> <p>\"Such cooperation in fact can never be justified, not by invoking respect for the freedom of others nor by appealing to the fact that it is foreseen and required by civil law.\" </p> <p>But when he was asked if Catholics could vote for a politician who backed legalised abortion, the Vatican spokesman, Dr Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said: \"[the Holy See never gets involved in electoral or political matters directly.\"</p>",
  "<p>Intriguing developments at Manchester United, where directors have terminated talks with a potential cash bidder (Malcolm Glazer) because the resultant highly leveraged financial structure would not have suited \"the future operation of the football club\". </p> <p>This sort of statement is guaranteed to get right up the nose of publicly listed company purists: the directors are stewards of the business, who are under a statutory duty to operate in the best interests of the owners, the shareholders. Cash is cash and deserves serious consideration. </p> <p>All of which is true. This has echoes of Philip Green's abortive, condition-laden proposal to pay 400p-a-share for Marks &amp; Spencer - a move that was partly repulsed using an argument that M&amp;S enjoyed a wider, more social sense of ownership beyond the handful of institutions and hedge funds that might control a significant portion of its share capital at any one time. The difference that time, of course, was that the M&amp;S board believed PG was simply failing to offer as much as the business was worth. </p> <p>At United, there have been no such claims - just an observation that the new financial structure envisaged by Glazer would not be appropriate. </p> <p>But before Glazer's advisers, American bankers JP Morgan, get too hot under the collar about this, we should humbly point out that under UK takeover rules there is an established process to challenge such a declaration. </p> <p>It's called launching a takeover bid. The predator states, publicly, how much cash and/or stock it is willing to pay for each share in the target company. The financial adviser then stands behind the bidder to guarantee the terms. Shareholders usually then have 60 days in which to accept the offer, sell their shares in the market or reject the terms. </p> <p>Demanding access to the books, just because you have turned up and made a lot of noise (without putting real money on the table), is a Philip Green trick. </p> <p>There is no reason why any established, solvent company should cave in to such bullying. We have reached a point where Glazer and JP Morgan should either bid or shut up. If neither happens then the Takeover Panel should use its guillotine. </p> <p><strong> Leighton learning </strong><br> </p> <p> The Financial Services Authority, in its role as Britain's all-powerful financial watchdog, has a thing called the Financial Services Practitioners' Panel. </p> <p>In the lingo, this is supposed to act as \"a statutory body that represents the interests of practitioners within the regulatory framework, principally by ensuring that the FSA takes account of the views and concerns of regulated firms in the development of regulatory policy and in its operation generally\". </p> <p>Which is all well and good. Aside from the immediate challenges faced by the panel's chairman, Prudential chief executive Jonathan Bloomer, struggling to sell a \u00a31bn rights issue to his disbelieving investors, the members of this body are a worthy, uncontroversial lot who should be able to offer a shoulder or two when it comes to keeping the FSA on a sensible regulatory road. </p> <p>Then yesterday the panel announced the promotion of one Roy Leighton to be deputy chairman. </p> <p>Mr Leighton certainly knows the financial coal face: he was closely involved in one of the greatest regulatory failures London has seen in modern times, when Sumitomo of Japan lost billions through the London copper market and various British-based operators made off with profits that ran into the hundreds of millions. </p> <p>Back in 1996, Mr Leighton ran Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais Rouse, a wing of the French bank now known as Caylon. His firm facilitated a string of trades between Sumitomo's chief copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, and an innovative British copper broker called Winchester Commodities - business that mushroomed into a string of huge deals involving numerous investment banks and ultimately brought Sumitomo to its corporate knees. </p> <p>While regulatory inquiries in Britain did not result in any action against the individuals involved, the affair exposed the London Metals Exchange as being hopelessly out of date when it came to monitoring the complex trading happening under its regulatory nose. </p> <p>Similarly, it exposed the failure of what was then the Securities and Futures Authority (now part of the FSA) to understand the huge business that was done \"off-market,\" around the fringes of this physical exchange. </p> <p>Only now, eight years later, is the role of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais Rouse and Mr Leighton being examined thoroughly in public as Sumitomo pursues a \u00a3400m high court claim for damages. </p> <p>It may be that this civil litigation exonerates Mr Leighton and his colleagues once and for all. </p> <p>It may also prove to be the case that when Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais met this newspaper's inquiries into the Sumitomo affair with legal threats, this was simply a case of institutional nerves. </p> <p>Either way, it would be good to get these things straightened out before Mr Leighton is placed too close to the heart of the City's regulatory process. He might be the UK chairman of a French bank, but this isn't France.</p>",
  "<p>Somerfield is embarking on a rapid expansion by buying small Safeway stores that are no longer wanted by WM Morrison. </p> <p>Having fended off an unwanted takeover bid last year, Somerfield raised \u00a351m through a share placing to help finance the intricately structured deal. </p> <p>The grocer, which also owns the downmarket Kwik Save chain, is taking over 114 Safeway stores it will rebrand as Somerfields by next spring. </p> <p>It is buying 63 stores directly for \u00a3115m and leasing another 51 from a consortium formed by Barclays bank and R20, the vehicle owned by property investor Robert Tchenguiz, which is buying the stores from Morrisons. </p> <p>The Barclays-R20 consortium, known as Northwharf, is also buying a distribution centre at Welwyn, which will be used by Somerfield. </p> <p>Shares in Somerfield, which raised the \u00a351m by placing shares at 130p, ended 2.75p higher at 131.75p, while Morrisons fell 2.25p to 217.75p. </p> <p>Bob Stott, the joint managing director of Morrisons, said the disposal - for which the Bradford group will receive \u00a3260m in cash - would allow it to focus on larger stores and help it speed up the process of converting Safeway stores into Morrisons. </p> <p>The sale of the smaller stores was not required by the competition authorities as a condition of the Morrison's takeover of Safeway, although two of the stores sold yesterday were among the 52 Morrisons was required to sell. Morrisons has now sold off 45 of the stores it was told to sell when it gained regulatory approval at the end of last year to take control of Safeway. </p> <p>Steve Back, the Somerfield chief executive, said each of the Safeway stores would take three days to refit. </p> <p>Mr Back, who was elevated from finance director six weeks ago, said 35 would be completed before Christmas. The refit would then be temporarily stopped until mid-January, when Somerfield aimed to fit out five Safeways a week. </p> <p>Analysts said the acquisition of the Safeway stores, which are barely breaking even for Morrisons, would help dilute the presence of Kwik Save for the overall Somerfield group. The acquisition of Kwik Save has provided a constant stream of problems for the group since it was bought by Somerfield in 1998. </p> <p>Analysts at Shore Capital said the new Safeway stores might help to make the Somerfield business less attractive as a takeover target. \"Only a leveraged buyer, for which there appears to be no clear exit, is likely to be interested in an expanded Somerfield. We have our doubts about the likelihood of corporate activity in the short term,\" the Shore Capital analysts said. </p> <p>However, they wondered whether the Safeway brand was more attractive to shoppers than Somerfields and questioned the impact that the price war between the bigger players - Tesco, Asda and Morrison - might have on Somerfield, which is not known for its positioning in the market on price.</p>",
  "Juries in trials for a range of offences under the Theft Act or for child sex offences may be told if a defendant has previous convictions in the same group of crimes, under proposed legislation unveiled by the government yesterday. <p>Under an order laid before parliament, which has to be debated by both houses, judges will be able to order that juries should be told if a defendant standing trial for an offence in one of these groups had an earlier conviction for an offence in the same group. An offence for burglary, for example, would be considered relevant if a defendant was charged with theft. </p> <p>Provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 which come into force in December will allow much wider disclosure of previous convictions and other \"bad character\" in criminal trials generally. </p> <p>At present such evidence is inadmissible unless a defendant is alleged to have carried out repeated crimes in a \"strikingly similar\" way. </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said the two categories had been chosen for special treatment because these were crimes where there was a propensity to repeat the offence - making it more likely that previous convictions would be relevant. </p> <p>But the defence would still be able to argue that the previous convictions should not be admitted because prejudice against the defendant would lead to an unfair trial. </p> <p>Research with mock juries has shown that jurors are likely to believe a defendant guilty if they know he has committed a similar offence in the past, particularly a sexual offence against children. </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, said the measure would allow juries to have greater access to information about previous convictions and other types of misconduct \"without unduly prejudicing the fairness of the trial\". </p> <p>Generally, evidence about a defendant's bad character has been inadmissible in trials and disclosing such information to a jury would usually lead to the abandonment of the trial and a retrial ordered by the judge. </p> <p>\"Trials should be a search for the truth and juries should be trusted with all the relevant evidence available to help them to reach proper and fair decisions,\" said Mr Blunkett. </p> <p>\"Bad character\" is defined to include not only previous convictions but other current charges faced by the defendant, and \"relevant evidence of disposition\" such as an admitted sexual interest in children. </p> <p>The act, which will apply in crown courts and magistrates courts, will allow prosecutors to argue for the introduction of such evidence in criminal trials generally, if they can show that its value as evidence outweighs the prejudice it may create. Courts will have discretion on whether or not to allow previous convictions to be made known. </p> <p>The Law Society said the decision to bring in the reform in December, rather than next spring as originally planned, would lead to \"chaos in the courts\" because there was not enough time for training judges. </p> <p>Barry Hugill, of the human rights group Liberty, said the measure was sure to lead to miscarriages of justice. </p> <p>\"With the best will in the world, most jurors would find it very difficult not to be influenced by admission of previous convictions,\" he said. </p> <p>Rod Dalley, vice-chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: \"On too many occasions my colleagues have watched the devastation and anger on the faces of victims and the astonishment of juries as a whole catalogue of relevant previous convictions are read out at the end of a trial as the defendant walks free.\"</p>",
  "It's shortly after 9am and Tony Borg has done well on the roulette by his standards - he started with $50 (\u00a320) and has already doubled his money. After a daily 15-mile round trip, Mr Borg returns home out of pocket thanks to the Panthers' entertainment complex in Penrith in the outer suburbs of Sydney. <p>\"When do I win?\" he laughs. \"I never win.\" But Mr Borg is undeterred. If he wants to, he can stay until 6am the next day when by law the machines must be switched off until the doors open again at 9am . </p> <p>Mr Borg is in good company. Around 82% of Australians gamble and 40% of the population does it at least once a week. The Penrith Panthers' World of Entertainment, owned by the rugby league club of the same name, claims to be the biggest club of its kind in the southern hemisphere and is keen to promote its family-friendliness by hosting children's events, rodeos and discos. Its playbill includes Elvis impersonators and comedians Hale and Pace. For a population of fewer than 180,000, the club's annual $52m turnover from 50,000 punters is a huge commercial success. </p> <p>Australians spend nearly 4% of their annual household income on gambling; three-quarters of that gets fed into slots in gaming machines known as pokies. But behind the family-friendly face of gambling, there is a seedier side to the nation's real favourite sport that wrecks families. </p> <p>The Panthers' mix of light entertainment and family restaurants would not look out of place at an out-of-town shopping centre in Croydon or Salford. But the club's main attraction are the banks of 900 poker machines spread over two floors which are gradually filling up with punters. Bingo calls to win the meat draw on show in the fridge can be heard just above the jangle of coins showering into metal trays. </p> <p>Leanne Kirkman has dropped her son off at day care. \"I popped to Krispy Kreme, so I thought I'd come in for some time to myself,\" she confesses. Her biggest win was $600 on a ranch-themed pokie. \"I only come once in every blue moon and have a $20 limit,\" she says. </p> <p>If Mrs Kirkman shows restraint, some of her fellow gamblers cannot. An estimated 1.5%-2.5% of Australians have severe problems with gambling. </p> <p>Access to gaming encourages problem gambling, according to the Rev Chester Carter, manager of the Wesley Gambling Counselling Service in Sydney. It was set up 10 years ago when permission was granted for Sydney's only casino which pays the service 2% levy on its profits each year. The counselling service supports 1,000 gambling addicts and their families each year with a 30% success rate. Most are hooked on the pokie machines found in almost every club and pub. </p> <p>\"Ease of access and cash is a deadly combination,\" he says. \"Problem gambling is like alcoholism. They have to stay away from these places, otherwise they'll never be right. One bet for a gambler is like one drink for an alcoholic.\" </p> <p>Such thirst for gambling comes from payouts of up to $100,000. And for those who lose a lot, the humiliation is not as great as playing on the baize of a real roulette or blackjack table. </p> <p>But it's not just individuals or commercial enterprises which find the gambling irresistible. The average profit from a pokie is $40,000 and in 2001/2002 takings from gambling in New South Wales alone was worth $5.7bn. </p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly for a country that loves to gamble, there are only eight casinos in Australia. But what they lack in number, they make up for in size. The ranks of cash machines in the marble lobby of Star City's harbourside casino allow for no illusions that this place is all about big losers, not big wins. The cavernous Vegas-style glitz inside features a red rock and waterfall installation. Beneath the symbols of aboriginal dreamtime hundreds of young men throng around the only gaming tables in the city placing up to $100 stakes on Caribbean stud or pontoon. </p> <p>Mr Carter says the UK regulators should learn from Australia's mistakes. \"England must watch out. The laws must not be made lax without safeguards. Constraints must be in place before it causes problems.\"</p>",
  "The public see government action over gambling, smoking and drinking as proper regulation rather than as \"nanny state\" meddling, according to the results of this month's Guardian/ICM poll. <p>The survey shows that more than 60% of voters believe that the government should \"regulate for the benefit of others\" where and when adults smoke and drink and where casinos are allowed to open. </p> <p>Only 35% say they oppose such government interference. The low level of support for the general proposition that adults should be left alone to decide for themselves when and where they drink, smoke or gamble runs right across the political spectrum. Conservative voters are just as much in favour of such state regulation as Labour and Liberal Democrat voters. </p> <p>The detailed October ICM poll results show that the nation is on balance against expanding the number of casinos, but that Britain remains overwhelmingly a nation of gamblers who like a flutter, especially on the lottery. </p> <p>However, the survey does provide some evidence to substantiate the \"whiff of snobbery\" charge levied by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, against the critics of her gambling legislation. </p> <p>For the ICM poll shows that it is Labour voters who most like a flutter, with 82% saying they have taken part in some gambling activity over the past year. This compares with 73% of Conservative voters and 63% of Liberal Democrat supporters. </p> <p>Once you take out those who regularly do the lottery, the poll confirms that Labour voters are the most enthusiastic gamblers, with 38% having played the slot machines, used a bookmaker, played bingo, visited a casino or gambled online in the past year. </p> <p>The poll also shows that the one social group narrowly in favour of expanding the number of casinos are C2 voters, the skilled worker class which forms the backbone of the government's core support. They back the idea by 48% to 42%. </p> <p>The ICM poll shows that the public take a sophisticated \"case-by-case\" approach to making up their minds as to what amounts to appropriate state intervention when it comes to the traditional vices of smoking, drinking and gambling. </p> <p>There is strong support for the proposal recently raised by Manchester and Liverpool city councils to impose a smoking ban on all enclosed public places, including pubs, restaurants and offices. </p> <p>Two-thirds of voters say they would now support such a move, including one in three smokers - a result which would have been inconceivable 10 years ago when Californians were widely ridiculed for taking such a step. </p> <p>Among non-smokers support for such a blanket smoking ban rises to 78%. The poll shows that the age profile of the 28% who admit to being smokers is still defying the best efforts of the government health campaigns with 38% of those aged 18-24 saying they are smokers compared with only 18% of those over 65. </p> <p>Yet when it comes to drinking, the public give almost equally strong backing to the government's plans to relax the law so that pubs can stagger their closing times. The ICM result showing that 57% support liberalising the drinking laws will come as some relief to embattled ministers who have faced a barrage of press criticism over the move. </p> <p>Support for staggering pub closing hours is strongest among the young with 75% of 25 to 34-year-olds saying they are in favour compared with only 32% of those over the retirement age of 65. Men are also greater fans of the idea with 62% support compared to women who still think it is a good idea but only among 53% of them. </p> <p>The results suggest that if the government does press ahead with its controversial gambling legislation, it may face a turbulent time with a hostile press but it will not necessarily be alienating its core support in the process. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between October 22-24, 2004. </p> <p>Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.</p>",
  "We regulate, you restrict and they interfere. The political declension is straightforward but, as this government has found to its cost, any attempt to change social behaviour in Britain carries with it implications that vary according to viewpoint. Today's Guardian/ICM poll and yesterday's comments by the prime minister on the gambling bill are examples. From one end of the telescope - Mr Blair's - the bill is a necessary adjustment of the law in the face of market pressure and a changing society. \"In a few years' time, people will be asking what all the fuss was about,\" he told the press yesterday. \"Gambling goes on. People gamble.\" Peering down from the other end the government's reckless deregulation of an industry that brings with it social ills appears well nigh inexplicable - hence the rash of weekend stories pointing out the scale of lobbying by an industry determined to get the law changed in its favour. <p>On gambling, today's poll gives weight to the government's critics. Most voters - 53% - oppose casino expansion even though 73% gambled in the last year. The fact that this habit was largely restricted to the gentle indulgence of the lottery - only 6% admitted to visiting a casino and only 2% gambled online - may reflect a lack of demand for the hard stuff or it may show that the law as it stands makes stronger forms of gambling tricky to get hold of. Either way it does not make a compelling case for relaxing the law. </p> <p>Voters sensibly cut through scare stories about the nanny state by giving clear backing to at least some state regulation of smoking, drinking and gambling - 61% agree individuals should not be left to decide for themselves. That balanced view shines from the response to a ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces such as offices and pubs: 66% say there should be one, including 78% of non-smokers. But before the nation's nannys push their prams too far round the park they should note a contrary verdict on drinking. The Licensing Act, which among other things relaxes pub opening hours, fell foul of the same sort of criticism now thrown at the gambling bill, not least that it was shaped by lobbyists and harmed the public good. But 57% back it, including 75% of 25-34-year-olds. They might come to regret that choice - but they have made it. Voters will only accept restrictions on their behaviour if they can see the benefit. So on public smoking there is no ban - but people want one. On drinking there is a ban - but people want it lifted. And on gambling the law is strict - and people want it to remain so.</p>",
  "One might imagine that prison officers the world over have much in common. They all have to do the difficult job of locking up the people whom societies and governments have decided, rightly or wrongly, should be confined. But over the past week prison officers here in Britain and far away in California have been engaged in two very different and conflicting enterprises, both of which could have great repercussions. <p>The Prison Officers Association in Britain last week voted overwhelmingly against the government's plans to \"market test\" our prisons, which they believe could lead to the increased privatisation of our prison system. With a 70% turnout, they decided by 87% to 13% not to take part in the \"market testing\" that the prison department wants to introduce next year and which could take more prisons in to the private sector. The POA's general secretary, Brian Caton, warned that industrial action was on the cards if the government continued with its plans. </p> <p>Over in California, the union that represents prison officers, the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, is also heavily engaged in a political battle. But the officers there are on a very different side of the razor-wire fence. They are spending their members' money in a desperate bid to defeat a measure which will go before the California voters on November 2, the day of the presidential elections. </p> <p>The measure, Proposition 66, concerns the so-called Three Strikes Law which was introduced a decade ago in response to the violent murder of a young girl by a criminal who had committed more than three offences. The aim of the law, as originally proposed, was that violent reoffenders should have to serve a minimum of 25 years if they committed three crimes. However, in an emotionally charged climate, a harsher version of the law was passed that affected minor, non-violent re-offenders too. The result is that more than 4,000 non-violent offenders are now serving 25-year minimums. One shoplifter is serving a 50-year sentence for stealing some videos and there are many other similarly inappropriate sentences, disproportionately being served by African Americans and members of ethnic minorities. </p> <p>Gradually, the injustice of this system has become known to Californian voters, and next week they will have a chance to amend the law so that it applies to violent rather than to minor, non-violent offenders. This would inevitably cut the number of people in prison there. The prison officers thus see their jobs threatened. To this end, their union is frantically trying to ensure that this medieval system of punishment remains, publishing inflammatory and inaccurate material about the measure. The prison officers' union was the biggest single financial backer of the former governor Gray Davis who obligingly kept the three strikes law in place. </p> <p>Disappointingly, the current governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has also shown himself to be unwilling to take on this powerful union and their friends in the prison business. Despite this, next week Californian voters could well pass Proposition 66, which limits the application of the \"three strikes gets you 25 years\" principle to violent offenders. (And far be it from any pointed-headed, lily-livered, interfering limey commentator to urge any on-line readers resident in that wonderful state to vote Yes on Proposition 66.) </p> <p>There is a prison-industrial complex in California, as elsewhere in the US, and it is seeking to expand into this country. Small communities with high unemployment may welcome the building of a prison that provides jobs. What the battle over Proposition 66 demonstrates is the danger of introducing the profit motive into the criminal justice system. </p> <p>Countless lives in California have been ruined by the combination of this ill-conceived law and a prison system motivated by profit. The POA in Britain is right to resist the spread of the private prison system here, even if in doing so may not be motivated by what has happened in California. The case against prison privatisation was put very eloquently in 1993 by a young shadow home secretary called Tony Blair. He said then: \"I believe that people who are sentenced by the state to imprisonment should be deprived of their liberty, kept under lock and key by those who are accountable primarily and solely to the state.\" As the POA's Duncan Keys said this week, Labour came to power committed to fighting the continued privatisation of the system. \"Prisons should not be run for profit,\" he said. \"They [the government] have done a 180-degree turn since they came into office. Enough is enough.\" </p> <p>With our record prison population, the government is inevitably looking for ways to lock people up on the cheap. Private prisons, with their lower paid staffs, offer a tempting alternative, and we already have, with 10 jails, the most privatised prison system in Europe. Next year's plan to make state prisons compete with private companies could well lead to an increase in this number. While some of the innovations of the private system may be welcome, there is no reason why they could not be incorporated into the state system. As the Prison Reform Trust concludes in a paper on private prisons that it will publish next month, there still needs to be a far wider public debate on the issue. The PRT's Geoff Dobson said this week: \"We take the view that it is unethical to make a profit from incarceration, and that to do so necessarily builds inflationary pressures into the system.\" </p> <p>What has happened in California should be a reminder that there is something inherently immoral in any system where jails have to be kept full for reasons of economy rather than justice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:duncan.campbell@theguardian.com\">duncan.campbell@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "David Blunkett yesterday claimed to have blocked a headlong rush to set up a common EU asylum policy which would include a Europe-wide border police force and a single agency processing asylum applications for all 25 member states. <p>The home secretary spoke as Britain abandons its historic veto on asylum and immigration - fulfilling an agreement made in the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty. He and Tony Blair insisted that the new policy \"actually gives us the best of both worlds'.' </p> <p>Proclaiming the value of the \"opt-in\" deal he negotiated in Amsterdam, the prime minister told his monthly press conference at No 10 that it allows Britain to embrace EU proposals it approves - such as curbing people-trafficking - while retaining a domestic veto on unacceptable measures. </p> <p>At yesterday's meeting of the 25 justice and home affairs ministers in Luxembourg, other EU countries, led by France and the European commission, signalled their determination to press ahead and secure common asylum procedures by 2010. Downing Street does not deny the other members now have that right and that London cannot stop them. Nor does it wish to. As an island state Britain has different perspectives, the premier explained. </p> <p>Mr Blair emphasised: \"There is no question of Britain giving up our veto on our border controls. (At) Amsterdam seven years ago, we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in Europe. Unless we opt in we are not affected by it.\" </p> <p>Whether that quells the controversy being fanned by the Tory tabloids - with shadow cabinet support - remains to be seen. Last night the Liberal Democrats endorsed the adoption of qualified majority voting (QMV) instead of each nation retaining a veto. It is \"sensible and pragmatic\", said the party's home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten. </p> <p>One such example, biometric ID cards with fingerprints and irises included on passports, was cited yesterday by Mr Blair and will be discussed by Mr Blunkett and fellow-ministers in Luxembourg today. </p> <p>The asylum issue has become highly emotive in Britain, with lurid headlines asserting that the UK is giving up its independence by handing to Brussels the right to decide asylum and ultimately immigration policy as a whole. </p> <p>Tories have seized on the EU's approval of a new five-year plan, the \"Hague programme\", for a joint approach to cross-border problems such as terrorism, crime and human trafficking as a betrayal of the British national interest. </p> <p>David Davis, shadow home secretary, said the adoption of QMV voting - to be ratified by an EU summit next week and come into force in April - was the \"thin end of the wedge.\" It would lead to a common asylum policy with the UK \"opt-in\" eroded by pressure to comply with expanding EU law in the next few years. </p> <p>Labour believes those risks are slight and more than outweighed by the benefits of a reformed asylum policy. Eastern EU states, especially Germany, where the issue is even more potent than in Britain, appear to agree. They also share the Blunkett claim that a common processing centre was \"nowhere near coming\". </p> <p>\"This would require quotas and we would use the opt-out ... There is no threat to the opt-out and, if we don't like something, we can remove ourselves from it ... there's no slippery slope of scare scenario and I shall use the British (EU) presidency in the second half of next year to make sure of that,\" Mr Blunkett said yesterday. </p> <p>Despite calls from France and others for greater burden-sharing, he added: \"All we want is practical action rather than visionary dreams.\" </p> <p>That could mean sharing expertise over border controls rather than setting up a joint agency. Mr Blair cited Anglo-French cooperation to close the refugee centre at Sangatte outside Calais, a change that has helped cut asylum applications by 70%. </p> <p>But Dominique de Villepin, French interior minister, called for a swift timetable to respond to popular pressure for action to stem a \"flood\" of illegitimate asylum-seekers. Britain should \"act in a European manner,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>From his campus office atop the hills surrounding the New Zealand capital, Paul Morris beholds a panoramic view. It's a picture-perfect morning at the Victoria University of Wellington, and the city's immense harbour lies flat as a tabletop, gleaming and sparkling under a blue southern hemisphere sky. In the far distance, a cruiseliner chugs across the waters, and in the sky the sun hangs like a picturesque lemon.</p> <p>\"You wouldn't mistake this for Birmingham now, would you?\" the British-born professor of religious studies says with a chuckle.</p> <p>Everyday scenes like these were what spurred Morris, who was born in Southampton and taught for a decade at the University of Lancaster, to decamp for the antipodes in the late 1980s. It was to be a decision the 50-year-old would not regret. Although he still visits his homeland each year \"for the intellectual climate\", he sees little chance of any permanent relocation.</p> <p>Morris is one of a growing number of foreign-born scholars opting for an academic life in the South Seas. While exact numbers are hard to quantify, departmental resumes and anecdotal reports suggest the trend is steadily upward. International security concerns, New Zealand's attractions as a relatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly place to raise families, and the country's recent efforts to fashion its eight universities into more research-friendly institutions of higher learning are all part of the new professional allure of this South Pacific island nation of 4 million people.</p> <p>What's more, the New Zealand education system, which draws on both the English and Scottish models, makes the country \"a very recognisable setting for British academics\", says Morris. And, adds Brenda Porter, a British-born professor of accounting who is head of Victoria's school of accounting and commercial law, even the lower salaries seem less of an obstacle now than they were in the years before 2003, when she resigned her position as a reader in accounting at the Warwick business school.</p> <p>Allowing for the relative cost of living, she says, reflecting on her time at Warwick and as director of accounting research at Cranfield University, \"there's no question in my mind that most academic salaries here are better. And more than that, there just isn't the same squeeze on budgets. There aren't the restrictions on attending conferences and so forth that you'd find at some British universities.\"</p> <p>Of course, salary packages at British institutions are known to be famously tight-fisted. This is not the case at the leading American universities, however - but even here some recent arrivals to New Zealand are beginning to draw favourable comparisons.</p> <p>Elizabeth Styron is one such newcomer. A 27-year-old fine arts graduate from the University of Virginia with a strong literary background - the novelist William Styron, author of Sophie's Choice, is a relative - she first came to New Zealand in 2001, on a Fulbright scholarship to pursue graduate research at Victoria in her specialist area of creating digital copies of scholarly and classic books.</p> <p>The university went on to offer her the inaugural directorship of its New Zealand electronic text centre, which opened in 2002 and is styled after similar centres at the University of New Brunswick, in Canada, and Australia's University of Sydney, along with Styron's own alma mater.</p> <p>Today, the New Zealand centre has established a searchable electronic archive of colonial texts and writings from the 19th century, when New Zealand was founded by its erstwhile British overlords. The new centre has made available digital copies of the early writings of authors such as Katherine Mansfield, the logbooks of the explorer James Cook, and other texts no longer covered by copyright.</p> <p>\"In New Zealand,\" says Styron, \"you can have more of an impact, enjoy a greater breadth of experience and just generally do your own thing.\" In terms of annual salary, she calculates she currently makes \"at least\" as much as she would have commanded at this point in her career if she had remained in the same line of research work in the United States - around $50,000 (\u00a327,700).</p> <p>In Britain, a small number of her counterparts may earn more, \"but as far as I can tell they tend to be older guys who have reached the top of the totem pole in places like Oxford,\" she says.</p> <p>\"All of that said, it's much more difficult to get funding or grant money here than it is in the States, which is definitely frustrating. But on balance, I still prefer the experience that's available to me here.\"</p> <p>Would she consider going to Britain? \"Probably not. In the US, I was relatively junior, and that would have been even more true in Britain, but here I enjoy the space and impact of somebody much senior.\"</p> <p>The drawbacks? \"Institutions here struggle. Academic institutions in New Zealand, I like to say, operate in the spirit of a business but the efficiency of a university, which is the opposite of the US.\" Sometimes, too, the \"cultural asphyxiation\" of working in a small intellectual environment can weigh heavily. \"Now and then it really does feel like the end of the world.\"</p> <p>For Paul Morris, and others, even the smallness of the antipodean scholarly climate can be sort of beautiful. In his more poetic moments, he likens his parent institution to the \"University of Middle Earth\", a reference to Wellington's role in providing the setting for the recent Lord of the Rings films.</p> <p>\"There's a cache of magic here, a sense of new possibilities,\" says Morris. All the same, he admits, \"there will always be real advantages in Britain in terms of libraries, professional associations and so forth, which I miss\".</p> <p>Then he sneaks another satisfied glance out of the office window.</p>",
  "<p>When the young Celia Hoyles first went into teaching, there was such a serious shortage of maths teachers that graduates like her were allowed to go straight into schools to train \"on the job\". She recalls the initial challenge of working in a tough secondary school in London's East End, which could not have contrasted more with her middle-class Essex background and girls' grammar school education.</p> <p>\"It was an eye-opener, and I enjoyed it,\" says the government's newly appointed maths adviser, who has this month started work as the country's champion for the subject. \"But at times it was very difficult. I did my PGCE while I was teaching. It was quite tough.\"</p> <p>The shortage of maths teachers came under the national spotlight again recently, when Tristram Jones-Parry, head of independent Westminster school - and a maths teacher - was blocked from switching to the state sector because he did not have qualified teacher status, a condition of registration with the General Teaching Council. The news attracted howls of outrage that a maths specialist with 30 years' experience should be prevented by a procedural anomaly from using his talents in state schools that are crying out for teachers.</p> <p>Significantly, it was Hoyles who led calls for the \"huge shortage\" of maths teachers to be eased by employing people in Jones-Parry's situation on \"a case-by-case basis\", which could lead to fast-tracking to registration through a more flexible accreditation system. \"We have to support a well-qualified teaching profession,\" she says. \"However, there is a huge shortage of qualified maths teachers and perhaps we could be flexible and take experience in the place of qualifications.\"</p> <p>In her new role, Hoyles is increasingly speaking publicly about issues such as these, and says she is not afraid to give the government a kicking when she feels it deserves one. But the new job is about practicalities - crucially, helping to implement the government's maths strategy, which was set out in June in its response to Adrian Smith's inquiry, Making Mathematics Count.</p> <p>Her brief now is to revitalise the study of maths and to raise its profile for everyone, not just pupils and teachers, and its use in everyday life. A report published last Friday by the Institute of Financial Services, for example, highlighted worrying levels of financial illiteracy among adults and proposed that a new A-level (or equivalent) qualification in financial management should be launched.</p> <p>\"There are problems at every level, from primary right through to adult skills,\" Hoyles concedes. \"But I'm not going to think that I can transform the world. I have enormous support from the maths community and from the DfES and Charles Clarke. So everything is going positively, but I've got to have just a few short-term goals.</p> <p>\"And I think that, although primary is very important and I will do what I can to make sure the momentum is kept up in innovations for that age group, my first effort will be subject-specific, continuing professional education for maths teachers, because there is a shortage of maths teachers who know enough about their subject and the teaching of it.\"</p> <p>Also high up on her agenda is the 14-19 programme, for which major proposals have just been published in the Tomlinson report. The report advocates that all pupils study \"functional maths\" as part of the core skills element of the new diploma, and Hoyles is strongly supportive of this idea - although she favours the rather funkier label \"techno maths\".</p> <p>Tomlinson was shocked to learn from employers and universities that they feel they have no guarantee that someone who has attained a top grade in GCSE maths is actually any good at the subject. Although 94% of GCSE students sit maths, only 50% achieve a C grade or above and 90% drop the subject at 16; the Smith report highlighted a 25% drop since 1991 in the numbers taking A-level maths. Increasingly, students taking science and maths degrees are having to take remedial maths courses.</p> <p>\"Maths underpins so much and we have been in a quite steep downward spiral, where students are not continuing with maths at school, because they perceive it as hard, boring or even irrelevant, which is incredible, when it's so crucial,\" Hoyles says. \"We have had a debate among maths educators, some of whom think people should give up maths at 14 because it is so tedious.</p> <p>\"In a way, they are right. There is absolutely no value in being bored and failing. If we really want students to continue, we must think of ways that don't distort the subject: I'm very keen on making more use of computers. Initially, I will be trying to devise a new communications strategy to get more pupils to continue studying maths.\"</p> <p>She is taking up the post \"gradually\", eventually doing it on a 75% basis, to allow her to continue her own research. She will be seconded for two years from the Institute of Education to the DfES, and will be closely involved with the government's formal response to Tomlinson, due in a white paper early next year.</p> <p>Hoyles recalls Charles Clarke's now famous tale, that when he summoned the main official for maths at the DfES, 20 people turned up. \"I think an important part of the job will be joining things up,\" she says, \"and providing a link between the different specialist subject associations, the curriculum division, the standards unit and so on.\" But she is to make it a priority to visit schools to talk to teachers and pupils.</p> <p>Many challenges lie ahead, not least the possible need to tinker with maths GCSE in the short term. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority will shortly publish the results of its pilot of a new two-tier maths GCSE, while there is a recommendation in the Smith report to make maths a double award, worth two GCSEs. The latter will be controversial, given many pupils' inability to grasp even basic numeracy.</p> <p>Over to the QCA, she says. \"I think the QCA needs to work with the maths community to sort out the worst anomalies. We don't have to live with things that are wrong, but we must make sure the different maths pathways within Tomlinson are something the maths community is happy with and will give students the right grounding.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Additional research by Rebecca Smith</p>",

The majority of teachers in this country do wonders on behalf of our children and young people.

Walking the corridors, I witness daily the imagination, passion, enthusiasm and stamina of people in schools. All they need, as we all do, to truly learn, is to feel valued and to have the opportunity and freedom to express themselves professionally in secure and supportive environments. Let's recognise and celebrate the professionalism, vocation and commitment of the thousands of teachers and support staff around the country.</p> <p><strong>Kay North</strong><br> <strong>Parent, London</strong></p> <p>Miss Croft, who taught me maths years ago for O-level and showed me numbers weren't scary.

I hated the water and my sports teachers at school weren't very sympathetic and tried to push me to get on with it. Julie took after-school classes at the pool down the road from our house; they were called the Froglets classes, and she was really encouraging. I can still remember how pleased she was when I first got my feet off the floor - even more pleased than I was.</p> <p>She was really kind and understood that I was scared, and she would even get into the water with us. I've had lots of good teachers but I really remember Julie, because she was so nice. I can swim a mile now and it's my best way of keeping fit and de-stressing. She probably won't remember me from 10 years ago, but thanks, Julie.</p>",
  "<p>Every parent wants to send their child off to school for the first time happy, confident and eager to learn. As well as preparing the basics, such as coping with buttons and laces, meeting the teacher in advance, and locating the dining room and the loo, most will make an attempt to give their four- and five-year-olds a grounding in the three Rs.</p> <p>A new survey suggests over 90% of primary school teachers believe that children with a basic notion of reading and writing are more confident when they enter the classroom, and nearly half think they are happier at school.</p> <p>Almost three-quarters say that beginning to learn both reading and writing at the same age is more beneficial for children than being taught these skills separately. The same survey, however, finds that parents are far more likely to concentrate on reading and that they aren't confident of their abilities to help their children to learn to write.</p> <p>The report was commissioned by LeapFrog Toys (UK) Ltd, makers of technological learning systems. Not entirely coincidentally, they have just launched a new product, the LeapPad Plus Writing system, which aims to teach four- to eight-year-olds to form letters and numbers. A LeapPad system consists of a \"platform\", like a flat computer, with electronic cartridge \"books\" that offer different activities.</p> <p>Toy manufacturers are gearing up for the Christmas season, and there is no question that parents are increasingly turning towards hi-tech methods of teaching the most basic skills. The LeapPad is already the UK's second best-selling toy and has won the British Association of Toy Retailers pre-school toy of the year award two years running. But is this kind of gadget really any better than the more traditional (and cheaper) book, pencil and paper?</p> <p>Four-year-old Ella Wakefield was given her first LeapPad some time ago and has just received the Plus Writing system for her birthday. Her mother Liz says she loves the toy. \"She's very independent and she can put the cartridges in and work the pen on her own. She likes being able to achieve the tasks. When we get a new book, we go through it together and then she can do it all for herself.\" Wakefield feels the games are well thought-out and that Ella engages with them as fun rather than as an obvious learning exercise.</p> <p>Teresa Ceballos, vice-president of marketing for LeapFrog Toys, is keen to stress that a LeapPad is not a substitute for parental involvement. \"What we are trying to do is not just keep the child engaged but keep the parent engaged, too,\" she explains. \"If a parent is trying to figure out how to teach their child to write, we are prompting them with nice visuals and games.</p> <p>\"Mums don't want their children to be super geniuses, but they want them to know how to sit in a chair and hold a pen. If you talk to teachers, they are looking for similar things, including the ability to focus on a page.\"</p> <p>Jean Robb and Hilary Letts run Successful Learning, a scheme that helps parents to help their children learn at school. \"An expectation that children should turn up in school able to read puts pressure on parents,\" says Robb. \"We also need to remember that age in the class can range over a year, and if the youngest four-year-olds can't manage it, that doesn't mean there is any problem.\"</p> <p>Gadgets, she says, can help parents in certain areas, such as the idea of how to break down words for reading practice. \"You couldn't lose out by having one, but you could gain just as much from good picture books, jigsaws and practising drawing and shape recognition,\" she points out.</p> <p>Making shapes such as circles and straight lines is the basis of writing, she says. \"The most important tool is the child telling themselves, for example, 'I start here, go round and go back again' or 'I need a line that starts here and finishes here'.\" </p> <p>Jean Robb says she and Letts see children of nine and 10 who have no idea how writing \"happens\" - they have been expected to copy letters, but not shown how to do it. \"A lot of writing practice is done at home and some parents don't know how to help. There is a definite teaching element, sometimes right down to explaining how to hold the pencil, where to put your elbow and wrist, how to sit.</p> <p>\"Some children hate writing because, for example, they are trying to do it with their elbow tightly tucked into their side - it's physically uncomfortable, they get very tired, and their work turns out a mess, which is discouraging.\"</p> <p>Primary school teacher Judith Cartney, from Cheshire, has many years of experience with early years classes, and also works as a reading recovery teacher. \"Electronic toys might have some value, as long as they are something you share with your child rather than handing them over and leaving the child to get on with it,\" she says. \"But they are not a must-have, especially if you are on a tight budget.\"</p> <p>The most important thing for pre-school children, she says, is simply to get used to making marks on paper and to gain motor control by scribbling, colouring in shapes, using a variety of pencils, chalks, paints and felt pens, gripped correctly. \"If they can recognise their name when they come to school, that's brilliant, but there's no need to be over-anxious about it. If you do teach them to write it, don't use all capital letters, because it becomes confusing when lower-case letters are introduced.\"</p> <p>Talking about books, says Cartney, is as important as reading them for young children. \"Using phrases like 'What do you think this book is about?' and 'What do you think happens now?' helps children to become familiar with books and get used to phrases that go together, even if they aren't yet reading. But don't labour it. This is meant to be fun time, a shared experience, and pre-school years are very short and very precious.\"</p> <p>Wakefield, however, feels her daughter's toy has improved not only her skills but her confidence. Ella starts school next September. \"School is about confidence as much as ability and that has to come from the beginning. Ella loves the fact that she can already write her name.\"</p>",
  "<p>I wasn't picked out as being bright at school. The teachers just didn't think I had brains.

I wanted to be a doctor, but I was told I was too thick.

  "<p>In a hectic office overflowing with toys, harvest festival offerings and scrapbooks of school life, Sue Seifert is trying on a hat. The headteacher of Montem primary in Islington, north London - winner of the lifetime achievement award in this year's national Teaching Awards - recalls how she donned the elegant little number, complete with veil and black feather, for the first assembly of term, \"to remind the kids I was queen\". </p> <p>Seifert, who left awards judges almost speechless with admiration at her inspirational leadership, commitment and determination to see children in Montem's deprived inner-city catchment succeed, has the kind of confidence in her capabilities, borne of over 30 years' experience, which allows such pleasing eccentricities free rein. In a world where many heads pace their corridors clutching a management manual in one hand and a set of league tables in the other, Seifert can be seen joining enthusiastically in the school's Friday morning family aerobics session, or in her socks playing \"hunt the shoe\" with the children who come to a \"playclub\" in her office during lunchtimes. </p> <p>\"I think playgrounds are the most uncivilised places in the world,\" she says, though she has helped to transform the Victorian school's own grounds with a garden and a colourful anti-bullying slogan designed by a graffiti artist. </p> <p>Underpinning her many innovations - unconventional and otherwise - at Montem is a powerful sense of purpose, directed squarely at improving education, in the fullest sense, for all pupils. The school, lying on the busy Hornsey Road, is a far cry from the fabled Islington of minimalist restaurants and soaring house prices, serving instead one of the borough's poorest areas, with a high number of first-generation immigrants, as well as asylum seekers and other families with no permanent home. </p> <p>When Seifert arrived as acting head in 1998, however, Montem was signally failing to meet such challenges. With no permanent headteacher, and a poor educational track record, it was sliding into chaos and haemorrhaging staff and pupils. </p> <p>\"I had been a trouble-shooting head,\" she recalls, \"but I said 'the last person who did a job like this walked on water and was crucified'. It was awful - the children were out of control, the staff were not playing in a team: it was a complete jumble sale, a mess. I just felt as if everyone was drowning.\" </p> <p>The new head swiftly set about bringing order from chaos, drawing on experience gained running Islington's successful Thornhill primary for 16 years, and then helping struggling schools in the borough as a trouble-shooting head. Her reorganisation extended from the large - ensuring the best staff stayed and were properly deployed - to the seemingly small, such as creating an orderly stockroom where the scissors were all in one box and exercise books were colour-coded by subject. \"Staff had been stockpiling equipment,\" she explains. \"They never knew when there might be a chance to order some again.\" </p> <p>Two years into her tenure, Ofsted gave the school a clean bill of health, and governors persuaded their acting head formally to take on the job. Montem has never looked back, turning into a caring and secure community respected by parents, loved by pupils and with rising educational standards. </p> <p>Testimonies to Seifert's talents recorded by Teaching Awards judges all pay tribute to her hands-on style - a characteristic demonstrated during the Guardian's visit, as she toured the building's five storeys inspecting flood damage caused during refurbishment work. When the leak happened, on the first day of the autumn term, the head grabbed a mop, determined to ensure children returning after the holidays were not affected. </p> <p>\"Sue is front-line,\" the school's award nomination concluded. \"She is the person who mops up the sick in the classroom, does the extra duty when someone is off sick, cleans out the fridges, washes out the sofa covers and takes the lost property down to the charity shop.\" </p> <p>Still more important, perhaps, are the head's individual relationships with parents and children. </p> <p>Judges also noted how her \"uncompromising, yet unlimited love\" was demonstrated as she greeted parents and youngsters arriving at school, telling one father sternly \"You are late, dad!\", while offering cuddles in passing to the youngest children and commanding another youngster who had failed to return home, to his parent's despair, to \"see me later\". </p> <p>\"She knows all the kids by name and has an individual rapport with every child,\" said one parent quoted in the school's nomination, while a former pupil recalled: \"I will always remember Mrs Seifert for her witty yet strange sense of humour that always had an underlying sense of seriousness about it, helping you believe in yourself.\" </p> <p>A belief in her pupils and a determination to encourage them to have faith in themselves lie at the heart of her philosophy. The undeniable obstacles facing many of Montem's youngsters - some of whom have come from war zones, or from the most vulnerable family backgrounds - simply spur her to push them further. </p> <p>\"The duty I have to these kids is to put them out into society where they can operate, and if standard English and manners is what they need, that is what they will bloody well get from me.\" A child coming to the head's office at playtime to ask for a ball is smartly asked to \"say please\", and told: \"I like your smile, but at the right time.\" </p> <p>Almost three-quarters of Montem's pupils have English as a second language, and more than half qualify for free school meals, but none must be written off - as some staff did under the school's former regime - stresses the head, who relates the children's experiences directly to her own background as the granddaughter of Jewish refugees \"chucked out of Poland\". </p> <p>\"When I first came here, one of the teachers said to me 'What do you expect from these kids?' That phrase was like a red rag to a bull to me, and I said 'I expect them all to have places at Oxford University by the time they are 11 - is that too much to ask?' What right has anyone to condemn any child?\" </p> <p>Ask Seifert what she hopes Montem pupils will gain from their time at the school, and she is utterly serious. \"I can teach them to read and write and do maths, but if they leave me never wanting to open another book then I have actually done something seriously wrong. </p> <p>\"It's about the whole child. I want them to leave me with a love of reading, but also able to make decisions, to be people who can think, people who can debate, people who can make choices, and who care about other people.\" She grins broadly, and shoves back an escaped strand of grey hair. \"Basically good trade unionists!\"</p> <p><strong>The results</strong></p> <p><strong>The judges say</strong> <br>\"She has truly given her professional lifetime to generations of children and, through them, to parents, governors and colleagues. Her children's success is far more important to her than any recognition we can offer.\"</p> <p><strong>Regional winners</strong> <br>Sue Seifert, Montem primary school (London); Keith Chance, Hamilton community college (East Midlands); Helen Penny, Brentwood Ursuline Convent high school (east); Richard Townsend, Dunraven school (London); John Graham, Hurworth primary school (north-east and Cumbria); Patricia Johnston, John Spence community high school (north east and Cumbria); Tony Storey, the Hayfield school (north); Christine Charnock, Turton &amp; Edgworth CE/Methodist primary school (north-west); Tony Charnock, Holy Cross RC high school, (north-west); Anne Tanney, Holy Cross girls primary school (Northern Ireland); Aedan Kerney, Boundstone community college (south east); Pat Hallett, Fox Hill primary school (south); Joy Pritchard, Kingsbridge community college (south west); Carol Field, Ysgol Gwaenynog infant school (Wales); Eric Evans, Dyffryn Taf (Wales); Ray Speakman, Nicholas Chamberlaine school (West Midlands); Irene Hunt, Headlands school (west)</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow, in York, the Higher Education Academy is being launched for the sixth time - and it's unlikely to get any more headlines than on the last five occasions. Eclipsed in the media by coverage of last week's Tomlinson report on the school curriculum, the academy's existence is not yet a hot topic of discussion in university staffrooms. There, the juicy gossip is more likely to be about who is being poached by which university for the 2008 research assessment exercise (RAE).</p> <p>Now that whole teams of researchers, and not just individual stars, are being wooed in an increasingly cut-throat race for rankings, the academic transfer market is becoming an entertaining spectator sport. So is now the time for an antidote to the research obsession and an initiative to reinstate the importance of teaching in universities? It is, after all, supposed to be their main job.</p> <p>The introduction of undergraduate tuition fees and the prospect of students being charged \u00a33,000 a year has made universities more aware that their teaching, and the \"student experience\" as a whole, is going to be under more rigorous scrutiny. They all at least pay lip service to the idea that teaching needs to move up the agenda. But is the Higher Education Academy the way to do it?</p> <p>There are other national initiatives under way already, in addition to a mass of about 170 different training courses at individual universities - Southampton, for instance, puts all new entrants through a master's course in higher education teaching. Universities are currently bidding to become centres for excellence in teaching and learning; more than 70 bids are into a second round, and over five years 70 more are to be set up by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, at a cost of \u00a3300m.</p> <p>These come on top of the existing 24 subject centres around the UK, which make up the Learning and Teaching Support Network, ranging from bioscience to hospitality and sport, from law to performing arts. These seem to have achieved some success over the past four years in promoting teaching by appealing to what academics really care about - their subjects - rather than more abstract discussion of pedagogy or new technology. An additional \"generic centre\", based at York, attracts far less traffic.</p> <p>This summer, an evaluation of the subject centres concluded that awareness among academics had grown, but added: \"Evidence of direct impact on the student experience was difficult to discern. However, there were reports of reported improvements, improved sensitivities, a wider repertoire and knowledge of student learning, a more serious approach to learning designs etc that we can say is indicative evidence of a better 'learning environment' for students that can be traced directly to the work of the subject centres.\"</p> <p>There is still resistance among lecturers - one told the report's authors that the subject centres were an attempt to impose a national curriculum on universities. And, not surprisingly given current RAE fever, the report comments coyly: \"There are some hints that in mid-2004, teaching is less of a priority for heads of departments and programme leaders than it was in December 2002.\"</p> <p>Paul Ramsden, chief executive of the Higher Education Academy, argues that the new body is necessary to bring coherence to the confusion of different initiatives to improve the student experience. As universities gear up to market themselves to fee-paying students, at home and overseas, he believes the academy can help them with strategies and ideas, such as how to link international research performance with student teaching.</p> <p>He told last week's launch in London: \"We reject the idea of forcing every academic to get a 'licence to practise'. We'll work in partnership with higher education institutions and other agencies. We'll recognise that institutions are different, and have varying missions, diverse student profiles, different staff, and distinctive histories - and avoid a 'one-size-fits-all' approach.\"</p> <p>Ramsden, author of Learning to Teach in Higher Education, was recruited from the University of Sydney, a research-intensive institution that brought in a series of measures to improve its teaching, from peer review of departments to earmarked funds to improve teaching and promotion policies that meant no one became a professor without demonstrating outstanding teaching.</p> <p>His time there convinced him that research does not have to squeeze out teaching. \"The desire to find out and restructure knowledge on the one hand and on the other hand to communicate it to other people go naturally together for most academics. Most do the job because they want to help people learn things.\"</p> <p>But he is agnostic on the fixed belief among many academics that higher education teaching is impossible without doing research as well. Asked about teaching-only universities, Ramsden says his own experience of studying at Rutherford College of Technology (later Newcastle Polytechnic and now Northumbria University), where staff were not doing research, was a good one: he recalls sociologist Bill Williamson as an inspiring teacher.</p> <p>When it comes to raising teaching standards, his primary target is younger academics. \"New entrants to the profession are keen and interested and leaders of the future. They will get more time to research if they can teach more efficiently.\"</p> <p>The Higher Education Academy replaces the Institute of Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (ILT), which claimed 14,000 members, who will now be transferred to the new body. Ramsden is confident that numbers of \"registered practitioners\" will rise as more come through accredited courses at universities and colleges.</p> <p>The leadership of the Association of University Teachers has higher hopes for the new academy after meeting Ramsden, says Paul Cottrell, the union's assistant general secretary, although he adds: \"I don't think it's really filtered down to the ordinary member yet.\"</p> <p>He thinks Ramsden has grasped the fact that academics can be won over but not dragooned. \"The emphasis was much more on the importance of the academy gaining credibility with the profession by demonstrating its usefulness, rather than trying to impose things on the profession.</p> <p>\"I hope it will be done in a more imaginative and efficient manner than the ILT, which wasn't a terribly exciting organisation - it didn't set the profession alight. In the early days it took a very bureaucratic approach, which it did draw back from, but the damage was done and it never really recovered. Ramsden has a much more sophisticated approach and feeling for the nature of academic culture and how to get them on board.\"</p> <p>The union supports the academy's focus on training for new entrants. But Cottrell warns that, despite more recognition for teaching, the RAE still seems to be the driving force in universities and the academy still has a massive task ahead of it. \"They are still going to find it quite hard to gain acceptance and credibility in some areas of the system that have yet to be converted. It's a huge challenge - it's still about changing a culture.\"</p>",
  "<p>The public have turned their backs on the government's Individual Savings Account scheme, with figures yesterday revealing that for the first time more money is pouring out of the plans than going in. </p> <p>The sales flop is acutely embarrassing for the government, coming weeks after the Pension Commission chief, Adair Turner, told ministers that 12 million people are failing to save enough. </p> <p>The Investment Management Association said there was a net outflow of \u00a323.5m from share Isas in September, the first time the figure has been negative since their introduction in April 1999. However figures for cash Isa sales remain positive. </p> <p>Isas were launched by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, as a replacement for Peps and Tessas and initially boomed. Sales of share Isas soared to a rate of more than \u00a32bn a month in early 2000, as small savers ploughed their cash into technology funds at the height of the dotcom era. But nearly everyone who bought a shares Isa in 2000 is still nursing losses, and although the stock market has recovered from its March 2003 low, most technology funds remain 50% or more below their peak. </p> <p>The slide in sales has been exacerbated by a change in the tax status of Isas in April this year. Isas were initially completely free of income and capital gains tax, but in April the Chancellor withdrew a 10% tax credit, making them far less attractive for basic rate taxpayers. </p> <p>The investment industry is now lobbying hard to restore and extend the tax benefits of Isas. Richard Wastcoat, managing director of Fidelity Investments said: \"In an environment where people aren't saving enough for their retirement and the government is urging us to take control of our financial future, it is vital that there is sufficient encouragement from the government in terms of tax relief. </p> <p>\"The decision by the chancellor to reduce the tax relief on Isas has not been helpful in boosting confidence in the savings market and we would urge him to reconsider the move. The forthcoming pre-budget announcement is an ideal opportunity to do just that and to provide the added incentive for more people to start saving again.\" </p> <p>Isas were an important element of Gordon Brown's inaugural budget speech in 1997. At the time he said: \"Half the adult population of our country hardly save at all. So in order to encourage personal savings the government will introduce from 1999, individual savings accounts, extending the principle of Tessas and Peps, continuing to offer favourable tax reliefs for saving. </p> <p>\"Through the new Isa we intend to encourage the habit of saving among people who have never saved before.\" </p> <p>Isa managers say there is now an accelerating trend among savers to cash in their Isas. Simon Ellis, head of retail at Axa Investment Managers, said: \"The Isa in its watered-down form is becoming irrelevant. This is a real pity, since they were working for a broad swath of the population.\"</p>",
  "<p>The St Louis Cardinals made it through to the World Series on the back of their home form - six post-season wins out of six - but, when they face the Boston Red Sox in game three at home this evening, they must start making inroads into a 2-0 deficit or they may soon be staging a wake on their own ground. </p> <p>Game four is also scheduled for Busch Stadium tomorrow, with game five due there on Thursday, and, despite the reverses of the past weekend, St Louis are still outwardly confident of winning all three. </p> <p>\"We get to go home to a place we feel comfortable and a place we played well all year,\" said the catcher Mike Matheny, more than aware that their regular-season record of 105 wins was the best in the country and that the National League championship pennant was secured by winning four home games against the Houston Astros, and that after trailing 3-2. </p> <p>The downside of keeping the record going is that they may not have seen the back of the patched-up Curt Schilling, the Red Sox pitcher who did for them in game two. But the 37-year-old, in his third World Series and who uniquely gained his third win for a third club (Philadelphia in 1993 and Arizona in 2001) will be a happy man if his season's work is over. </p> <p>Schilling hobbled to the middle on Sunday with his right ankle again held together by stitches, the tendon sheath torn in the division series against Anaheim Angels still needing an operation. He then pitched six innings with blood seeping into his sock, conceding only one run, and did as much as anyone to secure the 6-2 win that seized control of the 100th World Series. </p> <p>Pedro Mart\u00ednez takes over this evening, well rested after pitching only one inning in last week's American League series decider against the New York Yankees. He comes up against Jeff Suppan, who pitched brilliantly in St Louis's game-seven win against Houston. </p> <p>Schilling actually woke up on Sunday and decided that he was in too much pain to play game two after coming in for, and winning, the must-win game six of the American League series against the New York Yankees with the same tendon stitched down. The pioneering surgery was conducted in 20 minutes under a local anaesthetic. </p> <p>\"I wasn't going to pitch [on Sunday]. I couldn't walk, I couldn't move,\" Schilling said afterwards. He set out for Fenway Park, nevertheless, his car journey punctuated by hosts of good luck messages fixed to telegraph poles, buildings and bridges and, when the doctor looked him over, they stumbled on the solution. </p> <p>\"Somehow we put an extra stitch in this time because there were some issues we wanted to try and avoid from last time and somehow we caught a nerve in the leg,\" Schilling said. \"We took the stitch out and things started to change almost immediately.\" </p> <p>He had another local anaesthetic before the start and turned in a gritty 94-pitch effort, allowing only four hits, to earn the victory despite some shoddy fielding from his team-mates, including three errors from the third baseman Bill Mueller. The Red Sox runs all came with two men out - Jason Varitek's two-run triple in the first inning, Mark Bellhorn's two-run double in the fourth and Orlando Cabrera's two-run single in the sixth. </p> <p>\"I just wish everyone on the planet could experience the day I've just experienced,\" said Schilling, who has been told the operation might be too dangerous to repeat. \"It depends what his tissues look like this time,\" said Bill Morgan, the team doctor. </p> <p>\"Hopefully I won't have to pitch again this season,\" Schilling added. \"My body is just breaking down on me right now. It's the first time in my life that I've felt my age.\" </p> <p>It is hard to imagine he will not play, if required. But, if the Red Sox get the job done without the man who was signed in November to help them capture the title that has eluded them since 1918, he can console himself during convalescence with the fact that a huge windfall is heading his way, with his salary increasing from $12.5m to $14.5m and a $13.5m option for 2007 becoming guaranteed.</p>",
  "<p>The New England Patriots survived a stern test from the previously unbeaten New York Jets to set an NFL record with their 18th consecutive regular-season win. </p> <p>Corey Dillon ran for 115 yards to help the Patriots win 13-7 and break the record set by the Chicago Bears 70 years ago. Tom Brady survived three sacks to throw for 230 yards, the rarely used receiver David Givens caught five passes for 107 yards and the defence held the formidable Jets in check. </p> <p>The Patriots won, as usual, by making two huge plays - both by veteran defenders - when the game and the streak were on the line. </p> <p>Trailing 13-7, the Jets had driven 64 yards from their own nine-yard line when Willie McGinest sprang out of the backfield to dump Curtis Martin, the league's leading rusher, for a three-yard loss. </p> <p>\"The draw is one of their favourite plays, always, and you have to account for [Martin],\" McGinest said. \"He's gashed us before with it. He just happened to run in my gap.\" </p> <p>The next play - fourth down and eight yards to go - also proved too familiar to the Patriots. When Chad Pennington threw to Wayne Chrebet, there were two defenders on the wide receiver and the pass was swatted away. </p> <p>\"For once,\" said the New England coach Bill Belichick, \"we had him covered.\"</p>",
  "\"A giant leap for television, a small step in high heels,\" the presenter promised, unveiling France's first gay television station which aims to make gay culture mainstream and marks a new climate of tolerance in Roman Catholic France. <p>Pink TV, which launched last night, promises viewers a mixture of Wonder Woman repeats, prime-time opera and gay and lesbian porn. A daily cultural review will look at issues like tourism, health, poetry and clubbing from a gay perspective, in a style which aims to be \"more cosy than cheeky\". </p> <p>Supported by France's three main commercial television networks, the cable and satellite channel benefits from a relatively new atmosphere of openness towards homosexuality in France. </p> <p>Pascal Houzelot, the station's founder and president, said the country was ready for the channel: \"Pink is coming at the right moment. There's been a real change in mentality. We've seen society change, we've seen the law change ... Gays in France have gone from the era of tolerance to the era of legality, which simply means equality.\" The channel's creation has been met with enthusiasm in the French press. </p> <p>Gay rights have been hovering at the top of the French political agenda for months. The government is pushing through legislation which allows anyone found guilty of making a homophobic remark to be punished. </p> <p>Same-sex couples are recognised legally, and the fact that Paris has a gay mayor is now barely even remarked upon. However, anti-gay feeling remains; SOS Homophobia recorded a doubling on attacks on gays in 2003, with 86 reported cases, against 41 in 2002. </p> <p>The government is firmly opposed to attempts to legalise same-sex marriages and adoption by gay or lesbian couples. But Pink TV's backers are keen to stress it will not be a ghetto station, nor particularly militant in tone. </p> <p>Its target audience will be among France's 3.5 million gay and lesbian population, (between 7 and 8% of the total, according to the channel's figures). But for commercial reasons, Pink TV hopes to attract a large number of straight viewers to pay the \u20ac9 (\u00a36) monthly subscription fee, too. </p> <p>Sport will be presented by a transgender newsreader in a mini-skirt, who admits to a fondness for obscure sports like underwater hockey. But the station also offers Japanese manga cartoons, documentaries on subjects like being gay in Africa, and debates and interviews presented by one of the nation's most popular broadcasters, Claire Chazal. </p> <p>Pink TV will be retransmitting old episodes of Channel 4's So Graham Norton, as well as the series Queer as Folk, Tipping the Velvet and French and Saunders. </p> <p>The station's financial backers hope advertisers will be eager to cash in on the power of the pink pound, but it is not clear whether their optimism is well-founded. </p> <p>Lib\u00e9ration reported yesterday that there was a shyness by large advertisers to come forward. The only two comparable channels, Italy's Gay TV which launched in 2002 and Pridevision, established in Canada in 2001, are both struggling. </p> <p>Mr Houzelot believes the presence of porn films broadcast after midnight four times a week will help make things work commercially. </p> <p>\"Porn on Pink is editorially the right decision and economically necessary,\" he said, estimating that of the 180,000-odd anticipated subscribers, some 100,000 will come for the porn.</p>"
