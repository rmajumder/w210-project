  "<p>The big four accountancy firms earned more in consultancy fees from FTSE 100 companies than from selling audit services last year, according to a report yesterday. </p> <p>Tax advice, due diligence and corporate finance services propped up the earnings of Britain's biggest accountancy firms despite pressure on FTSE 100 companies to bar their auditors from bidding for extra work. </p> <p>The report shows that, while fees paid to the accountancy firms recorded a steep decline last year, non-audit fees remained strong. </p> <p>The figures will fuel concerns after the Enron scandal that accountancy firms are reluctant to shed lucrative consultancy work to satisfy investor demands for auditor independence. </p> <p>The big four audit firms - PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG - suffered a 14% fall in income from their FTSE 100 audit clients, according to the survey, with the result that their earnings fell from \u00a3714m to \u00a3611m. </p> <p>Figures from the firms, which between them audit all of the top 100 companies, would have been far worse but for a much slower decline in non-audit fees. Of the \u00a3611m total, \u00a3348m was from non-audit work while \u00a3263m was audit fees, according to Accountancy magazine. </p> <p>A spokesman for the magazine said there was evidence that FTSE 100 firms were increasingly putting non-audit work out to tender, but that the winning bid almost invariably came from one of the big four. </p> <p>\"There is something of a work merry-go-round happening. The individual firms might be losing work to each other, but they are also picking it up from each other. </p> <p>\"What they are really worried about is work leaking out to other professional advisers such as law firms, merchant bank and boutique specialists. However, the fact that all of the Big Four firms are undertaking recruitment drives at the moment indicates that they are not suffering too badly.\" </p> <p>Almost all FTSE 100 companies now include notes in their accounts stating they have introduced policies for appointing auditors to non-audit services, or making some sort of statement as to the independence of their auditors. Such notes were rare two years ago. </p> <p>HSBC put a price cap on its auditor, KPMG, limiting fees to \u00a32.5m, while Emap told PwC it would be allowed only to provide certain services. </p> <p>E&amp;Y, PwC, and KPMG sold their IT services businesses after the wave of financial scandals; Deloitte has not done so yet. All four firms have resisted hiving off other parts of their businesses, arguing it would affect the quality of audit work.</p>",
  "Scottish art-rockers Franz Ferdinand tonight scooped the prestigious Mercury music prize with their debut album. <p>The Glasgow-based four-piece band were firm favourites with the bookies to win the honour and walked away with a \u00a320,000 cheque. </p> <p>Their debut album has sold over a million copies worldwide since its release in February this year and has also been heavily praised by the music critics. </p> <p>Franz Ferdinand were nominated following their triumphant performance at this summer's Glastonbury Festival. </p> <p>When the winner of the Mercury prize was announced by the event's host Jools Holland, the audience of music executives, music fans and other guests rose to their feet and applauded the Scottish group as they walked to the stage. </p> <p>Singer and guitarist Alex Kapranos told the crowds: \"We really didn't expect to win this. We haven't got a speech or anything - we're truly gobsmacked, it's fantastic and we're very chuffed, very honoured.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Every band (on the short list) deserved it more than we did.\" </p> <p>He told the audience his band's success came at a \"fantastic\" time in British music. </p> <p>Franz Ferdinand were among 12 acts in the running for the prize, although the reputation of winning the award is traditionally more valuable than the money. </p> <p>Other nominees included Joss Stone, Amy Winehouse, Keane and Belle and Sebastian, while British dance and urban music also had a strong showing, with Basement Jaxx, Jamelia and rapper Ty. Northern Irish quartet Snow Patrol and 59-year-old British musician Robert Wyatt were also on the list as were Liverpool newcomers The Zutons and rapper Mike Skinner, alias The Streets. </p> <p>The Nationwide Mercury prize, now in its 13th year, honours the best album of the year by a British or Irish band and is dubbed the Booker of the music world. It is judged on talent and innovation rather than commercial sales and the winner can usually expect a surge in sales and publicity. </p> <p>Last year's winner, garage star Dizzee Rascal, otherwise known as Dillon Mills, announced this year's winner. </p> <p>Pete Wishart, MP and Scottish National Party culture spokesman, who attended the ceremony, said: \"I am very pleased for Franz Ferdinand and this award is more than well deserved. </p> <p>\"Scottish music is very much on the up just now and it was great seeing Snow Patrol and Belle &amp; Sebastian joining Franz Ferdinand on the shortlist. </p> <p>\"I very much hope that Scottish popular music is given a further lift by this victory. </p> <p>\"The Mercury Award is a particular important accolade in that it recognises the musical contribution of the artist, and honours the best album of the last year by a UK or Irish act, chosen from a wide range of musical genres.\" </p> <p><b>Background</b></p> <p>Franz Ferdinand stormed the charts with a manifesto to make girls dance using guitar riffs last heard amid the death throes of punk. </p> <p>Their biggest single, Take Me Out, has a famed opening riff which has sent dancefloors wild across Britain all year. </p> <p>The Scottish band are the standard-bearers for Britain's \"artrock\" movement, which is inspired by everything from Joy Division to Talking Heads. Franz Ferdinand, which was the name of an assassinated archduke, have also named obscure bands like Orange Juice and Josef K among their favourite artists. </p> <p>They are part of a wider surge in guitar music which can rival dance tracks for DJs' nightclub playlists. For many, they are a welcome relief in a British music scene frequently criticised for pushing too many acts in thrall to conventional influences like The Beatles. </p> <p>Their story is classic rock'n'roll folklore, a band who emerged from typically impoverished beginnings to become the toast of the music industry.</p> <p>Lead singer Alex Kapranos was given a bass guitar by a friend near the end of 2001, \"provided he did something useful with it\". He in turn gave it to Bob Hardy, now bassist for Franz, who originally wanted to concentrate on his career as an artist. Nicolas McCarthy, who met Alex at a party dressed like Adam Ant, eventually joined the band as guitarist while Paul Thomson became drummer. </p> <p>The band's first gig was in a friend's bedroom and their next was in a disused warehouse in a part of Glasgow once known as the Gorbals, then infamous for its slums and poverty. They even connected up electricity illegally in their base, called the Chateau, and used sunbeds to provide occasional light for hundreds of revellers. But police soon broke up the fun and were forced to intervene again when the band used an old Victorian courtroom. </p> <p>Famed independent label Domino Records soon signed them up and their second single, Take Me Out, released in January, reached number three in the charts. Their self-titled album also entered the UK chart at number three the following month and has also gone gold in America. </p> <p>The band has played across the world, wowed the Glastonbury music festival this summer and even won deals to wear designer clothes.</p>",
  "David Blunkett, the home secretary, today offered repeat offenders the choice of help to mend their ways or being fast-tracked through the courts. <p>At the launch of a government initiative to curb recidivism, he said the 5,000 most persistent offenders would be identified and targeted with programmes to help steer them away from crime but risk spending lengthy periods behind bars if they broke the law again.</p> <p>\"The message I am getting across is if you want help, we will help you, if you don't want to be helped we will come down on you like a tonne of bricks,\" he told an audience at Millgarth police station in Leeds.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett said the \"common sense\" initiative would give offenders a chance to mend their ways. He should have been done many years ago but it had taken a while to get all the relevant agencies working in partnership.</p> <p>\"We have to give them a way out,\" he said. \"We have to ensure that when they come out of prison someone meets them, their immediate housing and employment needs are looked after and there is someone they can call on.</p> <p>\"Above all we can get them out of the situation that got them into jail in the first place. And that's in our interest because these people by their very nature are repeat offenders and have done this time and time again.\"</p> <p>Mr Blunkett said it was communities that paid the ultimate price for repeat offenders.</p> <p>The initiative received backing from Ian Rayner, who presented the home secretary with his autobiography The Biggest Issue?, which details his descent into a life of drugs and crime following an unhappy childhood.</p> <p>Rayner, 38, who now works as a plumber's mate and lives on the Isle of Man, spent several periods in jail, including a three-year stint for burglary to feed his drug habit.</p> <p>\"At the end of the day if you are locked up in prison, with no rehabilitation then the chances are you will re-offend once outside,\" he said.</p> <p>But Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union Napo, said the Home Office still needed to increase its funding and address the underlying causes of crime.</p> <p>\"All the criminal justice agencies have been concentrating on this work for the last 30 years. Unless the Home Office fund probation and police to deliver, it will just be another empty slogan.\"</p> <p>\"The government needs a strategy to tackle the underlying causes of crime, which is principally stealing to feed drug and alcohol addiction.\"</p>",
  "<p>For generations, the islanders of Sao Tome and Principe made a meagre livelihood by cultivating cocoa. The recent discovery of oil in its territorial waters took the tiny west African state somewhat by surprise. The islands' 170,000 inhabitants lacked even an effective banking system in which to deposit their sudden windfall. </p> <p>Oil exploration and production has left its mark across the African continent over the last three decades. Oil has all too often has provided the catalyst for corruption, economic mismanagement, civil unrest and even attempted coups as with the botched attempt in Equatorial Guinea that led to the arrest of Sir Mark Thatcher last month.</p> <p>Angola is often cited as a prime example of the curse of black gold. Figures from the International Monetary Fund earlier this year suggest that over $1bn (\u00a3563m) a year of the country's oil revenues have gone unaccounted for since 1996. </p> <p>In Nigeria, meanwhile, the former military dictator, General Sani Abacha, is estimated to have siphoned off $2-5bn in oil revenues directly into his personal account during his five-year reign in the mid-1990s. The average per capita income of the two countries stands at $710 and $300 respectively. Sao Tome and Principe has already experienced its fair share of instability. Dissident army troops briefly took control of the highly indebted country in July last year, anxious to gain control of the expected oil wealth. </p> <p>The decision by the restored president, Fradique de Menezes, to publicly disclose all transactions resulting from oil activities in Sao Tome and Principe's territorial waters has therefore been warmly welcomed by international lenders and development agencies.</p> <p>Nigeria, which has joint ownership of the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, also put its name to the nine-point Abuja joint declaration, signed in late June. The transparency pact marks part of a wider programme of public financial management ushered in by the country's current president, Olusegun Obasanjo. </p> <p>The disclosure agreement explicitly endorses the <a href=\"http://www.eitransparency.org\">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)</a>, a UK-led campaign to promote the disclosure of payments to governments from the oil, gas and mining industries. </p> <p>Announced by Tony Blair at the world summit on sustainable development in September 2002, the EITI aims to ensure that revenues from natural resources go towards public expenditure on basic needs such as health and education, rather than into the pockets of the corrupt few. </p> <p>The EITI requires countries to establish ongoing independent audits of extractive revenues and to publish all payments by companies in the participating country. </p> <p>Nigeria is one of four initial nations working with the World Bank and the UK's Department for International Development to implement the scheme. The resource-rich state is also participating in parallel transparency initiatives run by the G8 and the New Partnership for Africa's Development.</p> <p>From an international investment and development perspective, the emphasis given to public transparency in recent years is easily justified.</p> <p>\"Lack of transparency undermines public confidence in the legitimacy of the state,\" Mr Blair argued in a speech supporting the EITI last year. On the positive side, transparency can help attract foreign investment, reduce investor risk and increase the efficient use of public expenditure, the prime minister said. </p> <p>Unfortunately, keeping the books as opaque as possible benefits the immediate interests of too many people in the world's poor-but-rich countries. </p> <p>In the last couple of years, pressure groups such as the <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org\">Publish What You Pay campaign</a> have turned their eye to the corporate sector to act as a catalyst for change, arguing that the publication of oil revenue receipts should be made mandatory. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly the position finds little support among extracting companies, few of whom are prepared to publicly break down the payments they make to individual countries. Confidentiality clauses, competitive disadvantage and non-participation by national companies have, by and large, combine to keep the data under wraps. </p> <p>Yet, some promising examples of more open book-keeping are slowly emerging. In May this year, the Angolan government took the unprecedented step of revealing that US oil major ChevronTexaco had paid $300m for the extension of a drilling concession. The government of Chad also agreed to an innovative revenue management plan for a 1,070 km (665 mile) pipeline led by US oil giant ExxonMobil. In a deal brokered by the World Bank, all the oil royalties and dividends from the project are paid into an offshore sequestered account. The oil funds are then reinvested in the country in the form of high priority poverty relief programmes. </p> <p>Essential to both cases, however, was the initial willingness of the national government to pursue a policy of openness. When BP famously decided to go it alone in 1999, disclosing its payment of a $111m signature bonus for Angola's block 31, the state oil company threatened to kick the British company out of the country.</p> <p>The example served as a convenient pretext for every other oil company since to sit on its hands, nodding assent to the principles of transparency but waiting for national governments to make the first move. With no obvious incentive for corrupt elites, such political will has been a long time in coming. When it does come, however, as with Sao Tome and Principe, oil companies will have little choice but to open their books. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Oliver Balch is managing editor of the bi-monthly journal, <a href=\"http://www.ccbriefing.co.uk\">Corporate Citzenship Briefing</a></p>",
  "<p>A union has set the date for legal action against the government on behalf of 1,000 steelworkers who have lost a huge part of their expected pensions, it was announced today. </p> <p>The Community Union said its lawyers will present a case in the high court between November 9 and 11 claiming that the government failed to implement European law to protect workers' pensions when employers are declared insolvent. </p> <p>The union is representing 1,000 former workers at Allied Steel and Wire in Cardiff and Sheerness in Kent who lost most of their pensions when the firm was declared bankrupt two years ago. </p> <p>The general secretary, Michael Leahy, said: \"Some of the members affected have made 30 years of compulsory pension contributions but now face destitution instead of the safe and comfortable retirement they had saved for.\" </p> <p>The union will ask for the case to be referred to the European Court of Justice, warning that it could cost the government up to \u00a32.5bn.</p>",
  "<p>Andy Robinson has vowed to try and do things his own way after taking over the reins as acting England coach. </p> <p>Former Bath and England flanker Robinson has stepped into the hot-seat vacated last week by World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward's shock resignation. </p> <p>Robinson, 40, has initially been appointed for England's November Test matches against Canada, South Africa and Australia at Twickenham. </p> <p>But he will be applying for the full-time position, and is a clear favourite as the Rugby Football Union prepare to begin their selection process. </p> <p>A panel is likely to be set up within the next 24 hours, and Robinson could even make a presentation to it as early as next week. </p> <p>Robinson today fronted his first press conference - at England's training base in Surrey - since he was handed the caretaker role. </p> <p>And having spent four years working alongside Woodward as an integral member of England's World Cup coaching team, he is clearly in pole position to take over. </p> <p>\"I firmly believe I am good enough to do the job - my presentation for the management board will underline that,\" said Robinson. </p> <p>\"I have got every confidence in myself. It is an honour that I have been asked to do this role, and I will hopefully do it my way. </p> <p>\"I am excited about the challenge. I have come from a background where everything is about winning, the winning mentality and the winning edge. </p> <p>\"It is about putting the players first - player management is massive.\" </p> <p>Robinson revealed he has no plans at this stage to make any additions to the England coaching team while the identity of Lawrence Dallaglio's replacement as captain has not yet been decided. </p> <p>Jonny Wilkinson, Richard Hill, Phil Vickery and Will Greenwood were all mentioned by Robinson today as players with leadership qualities, and he added: \"The captain has got to be guaranteed his place in his team, he has got to have the respect of everyone and he must lead from the front. </p> <p>\"I don't see the captain as a short-term matter, you expect him to be there for a long time.\" </p> <p>Robinson's first England training session at the helm will be on September 20, by which time the RFU selection process should be well under way, if not completed. </p> <p>\"We are not going to hang about, the process will be under way very shortly,\" said RFU chief executive Francis Baron. </p> <p>\"We are setting up the panel, and we have an established process that we go through. Andy has been England coach for four years - he is in pole position for the job.\" </p> <p>Other candidates, such as Newcastle rugby director Rob Andrew and Gloucester boss Nigel Melville, have publicly distanced themselves from the job. </p> <p>It is not beyond the realms of possibility that a candidate could overtake Robinson in the running for the job, but everything is pointing to him becoming Woodward's long-term successor. </p> <p>Robinson also weighed into the debate over whether Sir Clive Woodward should take the British and Irish Lions to New Zealand next year.</p> <p>\"In my opinion, he should lead the Lions - he's the right person for them,\" he said. \"There were major headlines last week, but it mustn't be taken away, the role that Clive had, which was to make England the No.1 team in the world and win the World Cup. That came from Clive, his inspiration and his enthusiasm. </p> <p>\"In everything that Clive has ever done, he's been successful. I am not his historian, but in my dealings with him and through my knowledge of him, he's always been successful. </p> <p>\"What he brings with him is that enthusiasm, that passion and that belief in himself and in what he is trying to do.\" </p> <p>Robinson, an obvious candidate for Woodward's coaching staff, was non-committal about his own prospects of making the trip. </p> <p>\"The Lions is a little compartment of eight weeks, and there will obviously be a lot of England players going on that tour,\" he added. </p> <p>\"The comment I will make is that I learnt a lot on my last Lions tour (Australia 2001), good and bad. I learnt a lot about the players, I learnt a lot about myself, but I also learnt a lot about Australia and the way they performed.\" </p> <p>Earlier this week, Lions manager and former England captain Bill Beaumont stated the committee meeting was simply a case of \"clearing the air\". </p> <p>Beaumont said: \"The appointment stands no matter what. My own view is that Clive will be taking the squad to New Zealand.\" </p> <p>And Wales coach Mike Ruddock yesterday also threw his weight fully behind Woodward, pledging he and the Welsh Rugby Union management would give the Lions every help they could in the run-up to next summer. </p> <p>\"I think he definitely has to do the Lions job,\" said Ruddock. \"I don't know Clive too well, but we texted him messages of support when he got the Lions position. </p> <p>\"Also, the WRU has decided on our policy not to restrict our coaches to working solely on our tour of America and Canada next year, so that we can help him with his Lions preparations if he wishes.\"</p>",

  "<p>Paedophiles who \"groom\" children with the intention of meeting and abusing them will face up to 10 years in jail, under legislation announced by Scotland's first minister, Jack McConnell, today.</p> <p>The protection of children from sexual harm (Scotland) bill will create a new offence of \"sexual grooming\" similar to that which came into force in the rest of the UK at the end of last year. It is partly designed to stop paedophiles contacting children on the internet.</p> <p>The bill was one of 12 outlined by the first minister on the first day of business for the new Scottish parliament at Holyrood.</p> <p>The legislation also proposes a new risk of sexual harm order (RSHO), which could be used to ban potential sex offenders from contacting children or loitering near schools - even if they are not convicted due to lack of proof or corroboration.</p> <p>A chief constable would be able to apply for an RSHO to be imposed on a suspect if they consider it is necessary to protect children. The order would apply for a minimum of two years.</p> <p>The bill would also allow a judge to impose sexual offences prevention orders, which restrict what activities an offender can do for a minimum of five years, when sentencing a convicted criminal. At present the orders can only be made by the courts, at the request of a chief constable, if the offender's behaviour after conviction continues to present public risk.</p>",

  "<p>An independent inquiry into physical restraint, strip searches and segregation in children's prisons was announced by a penal reform group today. </p> <p>The investigation has been prompted by the death of 15-year-old Gareth Myatt, who died four months ago in Rainsbrook secure training centre (STC) in Northamptonshire while being restrained by three staff.</p> <p>The inquiry has been set up by the Howard League for Penal Reform and will be chaired by Lord Carlile of Berriew QC. </p> <p>New figures released by the Howard League today showed that physical restraint techniques had been used 11,593 times in the three STCs in England since 1999, even though the institutions hold on average just 190 children at any one time. </p> <p>Lord Carlile's involvement with the inquiry will make its conclusions more difficult for ministers to ignore, as the QC is the government's own independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. </p> <p>Apart from looking at the routine practice of strip-searching children on arrival at jail and serious concerns about the use of restraint techniques, the inquiry will also examine the use of segregation - holding children in isolation. </p> <p>Lord Carlile said: \"My inquiry will consider the various ways that children are treated in penal custody that in any other circumstance would trigger a child protection investigation and could even result in criminal charges.</p> <p>\"We recognise that many of the children held in custody exhibit challenging behaviour and have complex health and social needs, but we are concerned about the forcible stripping of young people, long periods of isolation as punishment and the physical restraint of children. </p> <p>\"I hope that we will be able to make a sensible contribution to the treatment of children in custody.\"</p> <p>The director of the Howard League, Frances Crook, said: \"Lord Carlile's involvement will certainly give weight to this inquiry. I also hope the home secretary will take the inquiry and its eventual conclusions seriously because he obviously trusts the judgement of Lord Carlile.\" </p> <p>The three STCs, which are operated by private companies, hold children aged 12 to 17.

  "Black schoolboys have been betrayed by the education authorities for almost half a century and are struggling to overcome racism from many of their own teachers, according to a damning new report out today. <p>Members of an influential education commission say the failure of the schools system and individuals within it to successfully engage with students of African-Caribbean origin has severely hindered them and contributed to massive underachievement. </p> <p>Last year 70% of African-Caribbean boys in London left school with fewer than five or more GCSEs at the top grades of A*-C or equivalent, while African-Caribbean men are the least likely of any group to have a degree. </p> <p>During the research, which was commissioned by the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, and conducted over the past year, black boys complained of racism and stereotyping from teachers. They said chances of success were also limited by an archaic curriculum. </p> <p>Their parents told researchers they felt schools did not welcome their input. Black teachers spoke of discrimination. Only 7.4% of London's teachers are from ethnic minorities and 2.9% are black. </p> <p>The 285-page report, which represents the most exhaustive study to date of the educational underachievement of black boys, concludes that \"the English schooling system has produced dismal academic results for a high percentage of black pupils for the best part of 50 years\". </p> <p>Mr Livingstone, who has called for action to ensure that the number of ethnic minority teachers in the capital rises to least 33%, said: \"The composition of the teaching staff, governors and other professionals dealing with the education of our children must change dramatically to fully reflect the diversity of London's children.\" </p> <p>His officials have organised the London Schools and the Black Child conference to be addressed by schools minister Stephen Twigg on Saturday. </p> <p>In the study, conducted under the direction of the mayor's London Development Agency and an advisory board led by MP Diane Abbott, focus groups reached a wide degree of agreement: \"The consensus was that low teacher expectations played a major part in the underachievement of African-Caribbean pupils. In addition, inadequate levels of positive teacher attention, unfair behaviour management practices, disproportionately high levels of exclusions and an inappropriate curriculum took their toll.\" </p> <p>Pupils were acknowledged to suffer from negative peer pressure and many are said to be disadvantaged by inadequately funded schools with a high turnover of teachers. The insufficient level of involvement by some black parents is also singled out. </p> <p>The commission also heard evidence of direct discrimination. \"Racism manifested itself most harshly in being over looked for answering questions, verbal aggression from teachers and harsher reprimands than for students from other ethnic groups for the same misdemeanour.\" The report says that relationships between black pupils and white teachers was generally characterised by \"conflict and fear\". One participant complained: \"When it is white boys, it is a 'group' but when it is black boys it is a 'gang'. I think that's wrong.\" </p> <p>The commission found that in 2002, black boys started to lag behind from primary school year two. The gap widened every year after that. It plays down the role of social backgrounds because working class boys from other communities outperformed middle class African-Caribbean boys. </p> <p>In a series of recommendations, the commission calls for intervention on several levels. It urges ministers to give every parent three days a year paid leave so they can play a part in the schooling process. It also says black teachers should benefit from fast-tracking and \"golden handshakes\". </p> <p>The commission calls for urgent action to reduce the number of black pupils excluded. Controversially, it suggests that heads should not exclude pupils for a first serious offence unless the catalyst is an incident involving a knife or gun. It calls for clear procedures which would allow pupils to report racism by teachers. But they also call on black parents to play a more proactive role with their children and schools, \"regardless of resistance\". </p> <p>Last year the government launched a new package - Aiming High - backed with \u00a310m of extra funding to tackle the problem of African-Caribbean pupils' underachievement in both primary and secondary schools. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Education and Skills said: \"We recognise that many pupils, particularly from African-Caribbean backgrounds are not achieving their full potential. That is why we are working with parents and community representatives to raise the achievement of minority ethnic pupils.\" </p> <p>Steve Sinnott, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"It is grossly unfair to blame teachers alone for a phenomenon which is more complex than the report appears to make out.\" </p> <p> Rampton Revisited, The Educational Experiences and Achievements of Black Boys in London Schools , published by the LDA Education Commission. </p>",
  "The \"McLibel two\" today began the latest phase of their long-running legal struggle at the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. <p>Helen Steel, 39, and 50-year-old David Morris contended that their 1997 defeat by the fast food giant McDonalds at the libel courts had followed a \"patently unfair\" fight.</p> <p>The two claimed that their original high court trial - at which they were ordered to pay McDonald's \u00a360,000 in damages - had breached their rights to a fair trial and freedom of expression under human rights laws.</p> <p>Keir Starmer QC told the judges there had been a \"vast inequality of arms\" at the original court battle between Ms Steel and Mr Morris, who represented themselves, and the team of lawyers at the disposal of a major corporation.</p> <p>\"This case is about the rights of two ordinary people, without power or wealth, to engage in a public campaign on matters of public interest and importance,\" he today told the judges. </p> <p>However, a government lawyer, Philip Sales, denied the government had been in any breach of the human rights convention, and defended decisions not to award the pair any legal aid. McDonald's was not involved in today's hearing, saying in a statement that it was a matter for \"UK government, and not McDonald's\".</p> <p>Ms Steel and Mr Morris began campaigning against McDonalds during the mid 80s, attracting a libel writ from the fast food firm in 1990 after dispensing, but not writing, leaflets criticising it. Despite their high court defeat, which came after an English legal record 314 days in court, the judges ruled that part of the leaflet was correct. </p> <p>They said it told the truth when it accused McDonald's of paying low wages, being responsible for cruelty to some of the animals used in its products, and exploiting children in advertising campaigns.</p> <p>\"Although the so-called McLibel case came to court in 1994, the allegations related to practices in the 80s,\" McDonald's said in a statement today. \"The world has moved on since then, and so has McDonald's.\"</p> <p>So far, Ms Steel and Mr Norris have paid none of the damages, which were reduced to \u00a340,000 on appeal. In 2000, they launched a bid for the case to be heard at the European court of human rights.</p> <p>During today's hearing, which lasted for just over two hours, Mr Starmer told the court that, when the McLibel trial began, there were around 11,800 McDonald's restaurants in 53 countries, with total sales valued at around $18.75bn (\u00a310.2bn). </p> <p>\"By way of contrast, during the same period, Helen Steel's maximum income was \u00a365 a week when she was employed as a part-time bar worker,\" he said. \"David Morris, a single parent, was unwaged, and entirely dependent on income support.\"</p> <p>Legal aid for the pair had been refused, and they lacked legal resources or experience with no legal training of any kind, he said. </p> <p>Domestic law on defamation was also weighted heavily against the defendants, the court was told. Not only had they lacked financial support, they also - under English libel law - had to establish the exact truth of every statement contained in the leaflet. </p> <p>Mr Starmer said this differed from libel law elsewhere, in which the onus was on the accused to prove statements were inaccurate. </p> <p>\"For the duration of the trial, all the applicants could hope to do was to keep going,\" Mr Starmer said. \"On several occasions, they had to seek adjournments because of their physical exhaustion and, when Helen Steel was certified as suffering from stress and exhaustion by her doctor, the trial continued in her absence. </p> <p>\"The result was that, without legal assistance, the case was underprepared, unready for trial and was advanced by two inexperienced, untrained and exhausted individuals who were pushed to their physical and mental limits. In short, it was patently unfair.\" </p> <p>However Mr Sales told the judges that the fact Ms Steel and Mr Morris had ultimately lost their libel battle was not evidence that they had been let down by English libel laws. </p> <p>He claimed that the fact the trial had lasted so long and had gone into such detail demonstrated they had the fullest access to the domestic courts in England. </p> <p>\"They were given every possible latitude in the presentation of their case,\" he said. \"Indeed, the trial judge went out of his way to a quite extraordinary degree. It is clear the applicants had a fully effective opportunity to present their case.\" </p> <p>He said the government had to consider how to use limited funding in assisting legal proceedings.</p> <p>Afterwards, Mr Morris said he was satisfied with the hearing, claiming the government had been forced on the defensive by acknowledging that legal aid for libel cases could be made available in exceptional circumstances in the future. \"We will continue our fight because the environment and the planet is in a mess,\" he said. </p> <p>The judges adjourned the case, and were expected to deliver a verdict either later this year or early next year. </p> <p>Whatever the judges rule, the European court cannot overturn any rulings by the UK courts, but can only declare that the complainants' rights were infringed.</p> <p>However, it can award damages - usually small - for any infringement, and the government would then have an obligation to reform whatever aspect of the law had infringed their rights.</p>",
  "<p>It was one of the sights of the Piccadilly line rush hour for several years in the mid 1990s: Dave Morris and Helen Steel, a postman and an unemployed gardener, preparing legal notes under the armpits of commuters as they headed to the high court to defend themselves against \u00a32,000-a-day libel lawyers employed by one of the world's richest corporations. </p> <p>McLibel, as the case became known, was England's longest and most one-sided civil court case. The food giant McDonald's and its crack legal team had expected to take just a few weeks to get an easy judgment against the two legally-naive Londoners. </p> <p>The issue was an A5 pamphlet, written in the 1980s and distributed to just a few people, which accused the fast-food multinational of dozens of malpractices. </p> <p>But it ended up being a 313-day court experience, costing McDonald's \u00a310m and acres of bad publicity, and obliging Ms Steel and Mr Morris - the \"McLibel Two\" - to give up more than 10 years to fight for the principle of free speech, without legal aid or a jury. </p> <p>Both sides claimed victory when the case ended in 1997, but the judge, Mr Justice Rodger Bell, awarded damages against Ms Steel and Mr Morris of \u00a376,000, which they have not paid. </p> <p>This morning, the last and perhaps most significant act of McLibel will be played out in the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. Lawyers for Ms Steel and Mr Morris will appear for two hours in front of 15 judges to try to force the British government to change the libel laws which many believe stifle free speech, favour the rich and are out of step with other states. </p> <p>To the relief of the McLibel Two, they will not have to say anything. The evidence will be presented in written form, with a 10-page summary of more than 40,000 pages of court testimony and legal arguments made at the time. </p> <p>Their lawyers will claim that the UK courts breached two articles of the human rights convention, giving them neither a fair trial nor the right to freedom of expression. Being made to prove the absolute truth of every assertion in the pamphlet contravened the principle of free speech, they will say. They will also argue that it was impossible to defend themselves properly without legal aid, and that multinational companies should be in the same position as governments and local authorities and not be allowed to sue individuals. </p> <p>\"The contrast and inequality between the two parties' legal assistance could not have been greater,\" says their submission to the European court. \"McDonald's were represented by a QC specialising in libel law, a junior barrister, two or three solicitors and the resources of a large firm of solicitors ... All [Steel and Morris] could hope to do was keep going ... two inexperienced, untrained and exhausted individuals who were pushed to their physical and mental limits.\" </p> <p>If they win, the government will be under serious pressure to amend the libel laws. </p> <p>\"The thrust of the case is that the British judicial system is based on an adversarial model, where each party is equally armed,\" said Mark Stephens, of Finers Stephens Innocent law firm. \"It will be argued that because Steel and Morris had no legal aid, they were unable to get witnesses and scientific expertise.\" </p> <p>Mr Morris, 50, a former postman and union activist, is still a community activist with the Haringey solidarity group in north London, which works with unions and community groups. Ms Steel, 38, a gardener before taking on McDonald's, is now an electrician.</p>",
  "<p>The earth moved for me in Santiago last week. Pottering about my hotel room, I suddenly felt the floor shudder and reverberate. I even had a fantasy of filing a story to match the famously boring headline once concocted by Claud Cockburn for the Times: Small Earthquake in Chile. While the tremor left me mildly shaken, it had its metaphorical uses. Later that day, a Chilean dramatist told me it symbolised the fragility of democracy in his country. For me the tremor came to represent, rather more optimistically, the signs of artistic upheaval I saw in my short stay. </p> <p>No one can underestimate the havoc wrought by the Pinochet military dictatorship from 1973 to 1990. \"Culture,\" in the words of my dramatist friend Benjamin Galemiri, \"was seen by Pinochet as an act of terrorism.\" Under the dual threat of state censorship and physical intimidation, many artists were silenced. Admittedly, one satirical theatre group, Ictus, was allowed to continue - partly as a safety valve and partly because it was too popular to be quashed. But I was told a horrific story of how one night an Ictus actor was informed, during intermission, that his son had been killed by the regime. Unwilling to reveal his grief to the oppressors, the actor carried on performing. </p> <p>The Pinochet years are, thankfully, past - but not forgotten. While I was in Santiago, it was legally decided that Pinochet is no longer immune from prosecution. And the most popular Chilean film of the moment, Andr\u00e9s Wood's Machuca, shown at the Edinburgh film festival, vividly deals with the overthrow of the democratically elected Allende. But my overwhelming impression was that Chile - a long, thin sliver of a country geographically isolated by the Andes - is rapidly changing. Architecturally, it is full of extravagant new skyscrapers collectively known as Sanhattan. Theatrically, too, it is opening its doors to the outside world - not least to the sceptical, oppositional drama of modern Britain. </p> <p>I was in Santiago, as a British Council guest, for the fourth festival of modern European drama. Eight plays from France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and Britain were presented over a two-week period. What struck me was the variety of work on offer and the ravening curiosity of the young audiences. Marc Becker's Nosotros en la Final used football as a metaphor for our competitive, win-or-lose culture. Dea Loher's Inocencia was a weirdly atmospheric Germanic piece about urban desolation. Sergi Belbel's Forasteros offered a Spanish vision of the disintegration of the family. But the mood was considerably lightened by Caryl Churchill's Anhelo de Coraz\u00f3n (Heart's Desire), which was one of the festival's biggest hits, performed in manically comic style. </p> <p>This may come as a slight surprise to Churchill since her play - the first part of a double bill called Blue Heart - was widely seen as darkly absurdist when shown in Britain in 1997. Admittedly, there is something bizarrely funny about the way the action is halted and replayed as a married couple nervously await their daughter's return from Australia. But in Santiago, the family were played as gaudily clad grotesques who might have stepped out of an Almod\u00f3var movie; even the father's implied lust for his daughter was noisily foregrounded. What did come across from Paulina Garc\u00eda's exuberant production was Churchill's fascination with one of the great themes of modern drama: from O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh to Beckett's Waiting for Godot, the act of waiting is itself seen as inherently dramatic and symbolic of the human condition. </p> <p>Outside the festival, I also saw another Royal Court export, Sarah Kane's 4.48 Psychosis, playing in one of Santiago's 20 established theatres. It was an extraordinary occasion. The tickets, at \u00a35 a head, were cheap. The audience, again, was young. And the two actors and the director, Alfredo Castro, were all performers in a popular daytime soap who had taken time out to present Kane's uncompromising dramatic poem. </p> <p>Precisely because it is a text that doesn't allocate lines to individual speakers, Kane's play is susceptible to endless reinterpretation. In James Macdonald's original, the lines were democratically shared among three actors. In Castro's equally hypnotic production, the text became a confrontation between Francisco Melo's watchful, taciturn, occasionally bored psychiatrist and Claudia di Girolamo's anguished, ravaged patient. In a sense, it was more like a conventional play: an opposition between cool reason and authentic pain. But Di Girolamo, in singlet, baggy trousers and boots, cut an unforgettable figure, running the gamut from anti-authoritarian rage to wry, self-deprecating humour. And Castro's production, set against a clinical background filled with myriad light-bulbs, was masterly in its control of mood. </p> <p>Meeting Castro afterwards, I learned that he had also directed Kane's Blasted and an adaptation of King Lear but was wary of taking on the work of living Chilean dramatists. When I spoke to Benjamin Galemiri, a major Chilean dramatist and screenwriter heavily influenced by Pinter and Bu\u00f1uel, I gathered that he was equally nervous of directors: one of them had apparently added a fourth person to one of his three-character plays. But even if there is a power struggle going on between dramatists and directors, Chilean theatre still has vast potential at a key moment in the country's history. </p> <p>\"We are a society in transition,\" says Galemiri. \"We have shaken off the military dictatorship. But survivors like myself are left with a sense of guilt. We are also confronted by the emptiness of public discourse, the power of advisers over politicians and the fragility of our democracy. We are a foolish and crazy people but the raw material for drama is all around us.\" </p> <p>As I left the ironic, witty Galemiri scribbling dialogue in a cafe, his last words rang in my ears: \"Please stand up for writers.\" Which suggests that what Chilean dramatists really need, aside from continued exposure to the best of world drama, is the freedom to work unhampered by either censorious politicians or equally power-addicted directors.</p>",

  "Conditions at the largest prison in the country have worsened since a critical report 16 months ago, according to an inspection report released today. <p>Wandsworth, in south London, is holding inmates in ever more cramped conditions due to the rising prison population, the chief inspector of prisons' report said. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the prison was warned it would be contracted out to the private sector unless significant improvements were made. </p> <p>While there have been improvements - including the induction process and access to showers and telephones - on other indicators the prison had slipped back since its last inspection. </p> <p>There were more complaints of victimisation by staff among minority ethnic prisoners than white prisoners - 48% compared with 39%. Inspectors noticed racist language and action were commonplace and often went unchallenged. </p> <p>Anne Owers, the chief inspector, said the underlying culture at the jail, which has more than 1,400 prisoners, had not been addressed and some staff were actively disrespectful to prisoners. </p> <p>The report said control and restraint techniques were overused in response to minor incidents. </p> <p>Michael Spurr, the Prison Service director of operations, said: \"Wandsworth has had to operate at maximum capacity during a period of significant population pressure.

  "Any gallery visitor who has peered, baffled, from the bewildering splodges of colour on the wall to the bewildering splodges of prose on the label, is invited by the Tate to do better. <p>From today visitors to Tate Britain, or to the gallery's website, can write their own label for any painting on display. </p> <p>Now is the time for every good botanist, fashion expert, engineer, and theologian to come to the aid of the painting - along with anyone who can explain the Fairy Feller's Master Stroke, or who has broken their heart in a dribbly shower like Tracey Emin. </p> <p>Tate Britain's director, Stephen Deuchar, said he would particularly welcome contributions from visitors who may know far more about the subject matter of a painting than his art experts or the artists themselves. </p> <p>The 30 most vivid contributions will go up on the walls, beside the efforts of the curators, in time for British Art Week, starting on September 20. More will be added, and may remain for as long as the paintings stay on display. </p> <p>This is the first time the gallery has invited members of the public to join a contentious debate about how to label art. </p> <p>The gallery has, in the past, solicited contributions from musicians, writers, celebrities and other artists. </p> <p>Designer and punk music guru Malcolm McLaren wrote, of Henry Wallis's Death of Chatterton, one of the gallery's best loved 19th-century paintings: \"The Death of Chatterton is pure unadulterated fashion and so contemporary for that. It is far better than any cover of Dazed and Confused. It is sex translated into fashion and therefore by that becomes fetish. Fetishism is the embodiment of youth, for youth has to behave irreverently, believe in its own immortality, it has to take drugs and Chatterton did.\" </p> <p>Designers loathe labels, feeling they clutter up the purity of their bare walls even more than the pictures do. Curators hate labels because they worry that people read the words instead of looking at the art. In recent years the Tates Britain and Modern have experimented with labels at the tops and bottoms of walls; no labels at all except a tiny number referring to a pamphlet; or labels clumped together just inside the door of each gallery. </p> <p>This time they are inviting visitors to choose any work they like from the re-display of British art which has just opened - and asking website users to choose from dozens of pre and post-1900 works. Elucidation is sought for some of the most puzzling paintings in the British collection. </p> <p>Richard Dadd's 1855 masterpiece The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke is also up for grabs: nothing, including the title, made sense to anyone except the artist, who painted it in Bethlehem Hospital where he had been confined after murdering his father. </p> <p>The Tate hopes people who have lived near a landscape or experienced an event shown in paintings will explain what the works mean to them. </p> <p><b>Says who? Getting the public view</b></p> <p><b> Francis Bacon, Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, circa 1944</b> </p> <p><b>Tate label</b> \"Bacon often appropriated art traditions linked to Christianity. The triptych or three-part painting, for example, is closely associated with altarpieces and devotional art. Figures at the base of the Crucifixion are a stock image of Christian iconography. In this painting Bacon used these devices to depict three mutant organisms in agony. But, whereas in traditional Christian paintings the object of grief and pain is the crucified body of Christ, here there is no such motif. Instead the creatures appear confined in a hostile and godless world.\" </p> <p><b> Jill Purdy and Joe Coombe, both 24, Pennsylvania, English graduates</b> \"Even though the images depicted are completely foreign, their emotions are distinctly human. Although displaced, each body part is also easily recognised as part of the human body.\" </p> <p><b> Holly Robinson, 17, Northampton, studying history of art at A-level </b> \"I think it probably shows pain - which is maybe Bacon's pain. The use of colour, the props and the facial expressions all heighten this feeling of pain. The three stages are a little like the idea of the three monkeys who see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil.\" </p> <p><b> Luke Williams, 16, Essex, beginning AS-levels</b> \"It is an abstract view of life from three different perspectives.

  "<p>The editor of Russia's best known daily, Izvestiya, was sacked yesterday, two days after the newspaper carried strong criticism of the government's handling of the Beslan school tragedy. </p> <p>Raf Shakirov lost his job after the paper questioned the fact that officials claimed the number of hostages was only 350, reported that parents of the hostages were the first to enter the school ahead of the security forces, and published a powerful column denouncing the censored coverage of the events by state TV.</p> <p>Under the headline The Silence of the State Broadcasters, Irina Petrovskaya said the state channels panicked when the shooting started last Friday and failed to give live coverage like CNN, BBC and the independent Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy. They had to wait for instructions on what to show and what to say, she said.</p> <p>This was the approach which dominated the coverage from that moment, and it would continue. \"I'm sure that when the official version of what happened is worked out and approved on high, we'll be showered with more lies and muck. I'm also sure that those who used their own understanding of professionalism and reported things which they should not have done will be reprimanded,\" she wrote.</p> <p>NTV, the only national channel which was independent of the government when President Putin came to power, was taken over by the state four years ago. It was reporting live when the shooting started at 1pm local time on Friday. The channel quickly switched to prerecorded material.</p> <p>It went back to its reporters 30 minutes later and gave three hours of live coverage but stopped again when troops approached the school. The two main state channels waited until 2pm before broadcasting an edited 10-minute bulletin from Beslan. Channel One then resumed normal afternoon entertainment programmes, starting with a soap opera called Women in Love.</p> <p>Two of Russia's leading journalists with independent views on Chechnya were not even able to get to Beslan, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>Andrei Babitsky, of Radio Liberty, was arrested at Moscow's Vnukovo airport on Thursday and stopped from flying south as police searched his bag claiming he might have explosives. After they had finished, two strangers came up and started a scuffle. They and Mr Babitsky were detained and Mr Babitsky was charged with hooliganism. The next day he was sentenced to five days in prison.</p> <p>Anna Politkovskaya, a reporter for Novaya Gazeta who received death threats for her reporting on Chechnya and has denounced the Russian forces for atrocities, was mysteriously taken ill on a plane from Vnukovo to Rostov.</p> <p>After drinking tea supplied by the stewardess, she fainted.

  "The Liberal Democrats today put pensions in the electoral frontline, with a promise to boost payments to everyone over 75 by \u00a3100 a month. <p>With the Conservatives on the attack over pensions with a debate in the Commons tomorrow, and last night's shock resignation of the pensions secretary, Andrew Smith, the Lib Dems rolled out an election platform which would see the basic state pension break the \u00a3100-a-week barrier for the first time.</p> <p>The renamed \"citizen's pension\" would be increased from just under \u00a380 to \u00a3105 a week for the four million oldest pensioners, and the link between average earnings and pensions restored, in a \u00a32.7bn scheme which is set to form a central plank of the Lib Dems' agenda for the upcoming general election.</p> <p>The party also promised to make pensions fairer, especially for women, by basing eligibility on residency, rather than national insurance contributions. </p> <p>The party will also propose a new low-cost personal pension run by National Savings to offset concerns about private policies following the Equitable Life crisis. </p> <p>According to the party, couples over 75 would have an extra \u00a333.70 a week, with a million people removed from the indignity of means-testing.</p> <p>The new \"citizens' charter\" would be based on residency rather than national insurance contributions, and the Lib Dems claim it would benefit women currently reliant on a husband's pension or penalised for caring for children at home.</p> <p>It would also restore the link, broken by Margaret Thatcher, between pensions and average earnings.</p> <p>The party says the \u00a32.7bn bill for the changes would be met through savings from the abolition of the Department of Trade and Industry, another key Lib Dem policy.</p> <p>Plans would also include making occupational pension schemes \"opt out\" rather than \"opt in\" so that employees have to make a conscious decision not to save in the scheme, and a \"kitemark\" system so employees can check how their company's pension scheme rates.</p> <p>With pensions - both state and private - shooting up the political agenda, to the extent that fledgling \"pensioner parties\" have been founded and regular demonstrations are held outside parliament, Lib Dem strategists are hoping to capitalise on the so-called grey vote. Pensioners are statistically much more likely to vote than younger people.</p> <p>Private pensions are also set to be a key battleground in the election expected next spring, with growing unease among voters following the Equitable Life debacle and the experience of 80,000 workers who lost their pensions when their companies went bust.</p> <p>The Lib Dems also plan to increase incentives for individuals to save for their old age by reducing means-testing, which has been a vital element in Labour's approach of targeting money for the elderly at the least well-off. </p> <p>The Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy, took the press conference himself, such is the importance the party attaches to the issue, with a proposal to help people get a clearer idea of what income they can expect in their retirement by allowing them to check their future \"pension balance\" through cash machines. Annual forecasts would also be given to everyone paying into a private pension. </p> <p>The \u00a325-a-week boost for the oldest pensioners would eventually be rolled out to all 11 million people receiving the state pension, he promised. </p> <p>The Lib Dems' pensions spokesman, Steve Webb, said that those with modest savings now effectively pay tax at a rate of 40% on the first \u00a325 a week of their private pensions. </p> <p>\"Pensions need to be simple, flexible and reliable,\" said Mr Webb. \"So much of pensions is rooted in the industry of the 1960s and the family structure of the 1940s, and we need a pension system that fits with the modern world.\"</p>",
  "The world's newest parliament building opened today, 10 times over budget and more than three years late, as Scotland's politicians filed into work at Holyrood for the first time. <p>The Scottish first minister, Jack McConnell, shied away from any razzmatazz, telling reporters: \"It's what we do in the building that really matters.\"</p> <p>The Queen will officially open the building next month - a ceremony the republican Scottish Socialist party and the Greens in the parliament have vowed to boycott.</p> <p>Until now, the parliament's 129 members (MSPs) have squatted temporarily in Church of Scotland premises up the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.</p> <p>The new building was principally the brainchild of the late first minister, Donald Dewar, and the Spanish architect Enric Miralles, who also died before the project could be completed.</p> <p>As he prepared to spell out the first legislative programme to have been unveiled in the building, Mr McConnell, the third Scottish first minister in five years, described the building as \"stunning\".</p> <p>\"Built, I know, from controversy and argument, it has also been built to capture the promise of devolution and challenge all of us to meet that promise,\" Mr McConnell said. </p> <p>\"This building is a testament to those who worked long and hard to win devolution - generation after generation for whom this was the dream that made long nights and dark days worth it.\" </p> <p>\"But for the people of Scotland, it's not this building that really matters. It's what we do in this building that really matters.\" </p> <p>McConnell is set to outline 12 bills at Holyrood, including a crackdown on paedophiles who use the internet to groom young victims. The new law is expected to bring in jail terms of up to 10 years for those convicted. </p> <p>Reform of licensing law is also expected, although the decision on a smoking ban in pubs and restaurants will come later.</p> <p>Bills looking at changes on budget, health, housing, higher education, environmental, charity law, female genital mutilation and Gaelic issues are also expected.</p> <p>Other plans will cover the reform of Scots law, the creation of a Scottish transport authority, and education. Another five bills left over from the last session of parliament will continue their progress.</p> <p>MSPs took their places in the debating chamber before the presiding officer, George Reid, opened the new session at 9.30am.</p> <p>The Reverend Charles Robertson, minister at the nearby Canongate Kirk, then led MSPs in reflection.</p> <p>Mr Reid called for an end to the pessimism which has cast a shadow over devolution's early years. \"We must not now go back to the old Caledonian culture which simply reinforces doubt. </p> <p>\"We must look to the future, look over the horizon, think out of the box, raise our game and set about what the parliament is really for. </p> <p>\"That is making a difference to people's daily lives in Scotland, it's about building a Scotland that's enterprising and compassionate, about a confident Scotland at home and a Scotland at ease in the global economy.\" </p> <p>Lord Fraser's Holyrood inquiry report, due next week, could bring \"closure\" to the controversy over the \"massive failure of public procurement\", he added. </p> <p>The deputy first minister and Scottish Lib Dem leader, Jim Wallace, praised the new building, but said devolution was \"not about bricks and mortar\". </p> <p>He said: \"The challenge we face as MSPs is not just to live up to our surroundings, but to live up to the hopes and aspirations of the people of Scotland.\" </p> <p>The SNP deputy leader, Nicola Sturgeon, commented: \"The new building should be a motivation to MSPs from all parties to raise the quality of debate and focus on the issues that really matter,\" while Scottish Tory leader David McLetchie said the move offered \"the perfect opportunity for a change of approach\" to public service reform. </p> <p>Green group leader Robin Harper added: \"I believe those who aren't already ecstatic about the new parliament will learn to love it and realise it's not just for MSPs, but for all who visit it and work in it, for democracy, and ultimately for Scotland's people.\" </p> <p>The Scottish Socialist leader, Tommy Sheridan, said: \"If we are going to prove ourselves fit to sit in such an austere building then tackling poverty and inequality must be our number one priority.\" </p> <p>The UK government's 1997 white paper on devolution estimated that a new parliament building would cost between \u00a310m and \u00a340m. </p> <p>The 129 MSPs, who have had devolved law-making powers in areas such as health, education and justice policy since 1999, were originally due to move into their permanent home by summer 2001. </p> <p>The Queen will officially open the new parliament building on October 9.</p>",
  "<p>Mathematicians could be on the verge of solving two separate million dollar problems. If they are right - still a big if - and somebody really has cracked the so-called Riemann hypothesis, financial disaster might follow. Suddenly all cryptic codes could be breakable. No internet transaction would be safe. </p> <p>On the other hand, if somebody has already sorted out the so-called Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, then scientists will understand something profound about the nature of spacetime, experts told the British Association science festival in Exeter yesterday. </p> <p>Both problems have stood for a century or more. Each is almost dizzyingly arcane: the problems themselves are beyond simple explanation, and the candidate answers published on the internet are so intractable that they could baffle the biggest brains in the business for many months. </p> <p>They are two of the seven \"millennium problems\" and four years ago the Clay Mathematics Institute in the US offered $1m (\u00a3563,000) to anyone who could solve even one of these seven. The hypothesis formulated by Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann in 1859, according to Marcus du Sautoy of Oxford University, is the holy grail of mathematics. \"Most mathematicians would trade their soul with Mephistopheles for a proof,\" he said. </p> <p>The Riemann hypothesis would explain the apparently random pattern of prime numbers - numbers such as 3, 17 and 31, for instance, are all prime numbers: they are divisible only by themselves and one. Prime numbers are the atoms of arithmetic. They are also the key to internet cryptography: in effect they keep banks safe and credit cards secure. </p> <p>This year Louis de Branges, a French-born mathematician now at Purdue University in the US, claimed a proof of the Riemann hypothesis. So far, his colleagues are not convinced. They were not convinced, years ago, when de Branges produced an answer to another famous mathematical challenge, but in time they accepted his reasoning. This time, the mathematical community remains even more sceptical. </p> <p>\"The proof he has announced is rather incomprehensible. Now mathematicians are less sure that the million has been won,\" Prof du Sautoy said. </p> <p>\"The whole of e-commerce depends on prime numbers. I have described the primes as atoms: what mathematicians are missing is a kind of mathematical prime spectrometer. Chemists have a machine that, if you give it a molecule, will tell you the atoms that it is built from. Mathematicians haven't invented a mathematical version of this. That is what we are after. If the Riemann hypothesis is true, it won't produce a prime number spectrometer. But the proof should give us more understanding of how the primes work, and therefore the proof might be translated into something that might produce this prime spectrometer. If it does, it will bring the whole of e-commerce to its knees, overnight. So there are very big implications.\" </p> <p>The Poincar\u00e9 conjecture depends on the almost mind-numbing problem of understanding the shapes of spaces: mathematicians call it topology. Bernhard Riemann and other 19th century scholars wrapped up the mathematical problems of two-dimensional surfaces of three dimensional objects - the leather around a football, for instance, or the distortions of a rubber sheet. But Henri Poincar\u00e9 raised the awkward question of objects with three dimensions, existing in the fourth dimension of time. He had already done groundbreaking work in optics, thermodynamics, celestial mechanics, quantum theory and even special relativity and he almost anticipated Einstein. And then in 1904 he asked the most fundamental question of all: what is the shape of the space in which we live? It turned out to be possible to prove the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture in unimaginable worlds, where objects have four or five or more dimensions, but not with three. </p> <p>\"The one case that is really of interest because it connects with physics, is the one case where the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture hasn't been solved,\" said Keith Devlin, of Stanford University in California. </p> <p>In 2002 a Russian mathematician called Grigori Perelman posted the first of a series of internet papers. He had worked in the US, and was known to American mathematicians before he returned to St Petersburg. His proof - he called it only a sketch of a proof - was very similar in some ways to that of Fermat's last theorem, cracked by the Briton Andrew Wiles in the last decade. </p> <p>Like Wiles, Perelman is claiming to have proved a much more complicated general problem and in the course of it may have solved a special one that has tantalised mathematicians for a century. But his papers made not a single reference to Poincar\u00e9 or his conjecture. Even so, mathematicians the world over understood that he tackled the essential challenge. Once again the jury is still out: this time, however, his fellow mathematicians believe he may be onto something big. </p> <p>The plus: the multidimensional topology of space in three dimensions will seem simple at last and a million dollar reward will be there for the asking. The minus: the solver does not claim to have found a solution, he doesn't want the reward, and he certainly doesn't want to talk to the media. </p> <p>\"There is good reason to think the kind of approach Perelman is taking is correct. However there are some problems. He is very reclusive, won't talk to the press, has shown no indication of publishing this as a paper, which you would have to do if you wanted to get the prize from the Clay Institute, and has shown no interest in the prize whatsoever,\" Dr Devlin said. </p> <p>\"Has it been proved? We don't know. We have good reason to assume it has been and within the next 12 months, in the inner core of experts in differential geometry, which is the field we are speaking about, people will start to say, yes, OK, this looks right. But there is not going to be a golden moment.\" </p> <p>The implications of a proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture would be enormous, but like the problem itself, very difficult to explain, he said. \"It can't fail to have huge ramifications: not only the result, but the methods as well. At that level of abstraction, that level of connection, so much can follow. Differential geometry is the subject that is really underneath understanding everything about space and spacetime.\" </p> <p><strong>Seven baffling pillars of wisdom</strong></p> <p><strong>1 Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture</strong> Euclid geometry for the 21st century, involving things called abelian points and zeta functions and both finite and infinite answers to algebraic equations</p> <p><strong>2 Poincar\u00e9 conjecture</strong> The surface of an apple is simply connected. But the surface of a doughnut is not. How do you start from the idea of simple connectivity and then characterise space in three dimensions? </p> <p><strong>3 Navier-Stokes equation</strong> The answers to wave and breeze turbulence lie somewhere in the solutions to these equations </p> <p><strong>4 P vs NP problem</strong> Some problems are just too big: you can quickly check if an answer is right, but it might take the lifetime of a universe to solve it from scratch. Can you prove which questions are truly hard, which not? </p> <p><strong>5 Riemann hypothesis</strong> Involving zeta functions, and an assertion that all \"interesting\" solutions to an equation lie on a straight line.

  "<p>New terrorist threats have stimulated a massive response from British universities in an effort to counter attacks and understand what is going on in regions of conflict.</p> <p>In times of danger Britain has often had to live on its wits - just look at the impact of sonar research and the cracking of the Enigma code during the second world war - and academic work that could be of use today or tomorrow comes in all guises. </p> <p>Long before the Beslan school atrocity, for instance, Cerwyn Moore, of Nottingham Trent University, was studying the role of female suicide bombers in Chechnya. As he told EducationGuardian.co.uk in February the act of a suicide bombing is incredibly barbaric and seems irrational. \"But the planning that goes into it indicates that it has been rationalised. It seems to be very, very planned, but how do we accommodate this and what can we do about it? It's too simple to say these people are 'just fundamentalists'.\"</p> <p>Research varies from directly-related practical efforts to improve baggage scanning at airports to acquiring knowledge about other cultures that may help in the longer term - for example, the different ways in which Islamic societies have responded to capitalism.</p> <p>The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council is funding work on how bomb blasts affect neighbouring buildings - how different building materials behave and how the force of the blast is amplified in narrow streets. At Northumbria University a team is looking at creating microwave holographs when scanning baggage that would make it easier to detect suspect items. At the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) scientists are working on more sophisticated ways of recognising faces on CCTV - something humans are good at, but computers are not. One of the main problems is that staff get bored watching hours of closed circuit images and so miss telltale details, and what sounds like a simple problem may well involve researchers from a range of disciplines collaborating to make progress. </p> <p>On a different level, Charles Tripp, of the School of Oriental and African Studies, (Soas) is looking at Islamic responses to capitalism, which range from cooperation to violent resistance. Without equating Muslims and terrorists, scholars are trying to understand the background to current conflicts. </p> <p>In the same spirit, the Arts and Humanities Research Board gave a warning earlier this year that a new generation of researchers on the Balkans and eastern Europe was needed to replace those who were retiring. These countries are of strategic importance in the 21st century. \"Several countries of eastern and central Europe are about to join the European Union, while others lie on the ancient frontiers between Christendom and Islam. Researchers trained in these areas could have a role in the diplomatic service, industry and commerce, as well as academia,\" noted the board. </p> <p>But there is always the possibility that knowledge can aid the terrorist as well as the defence, and the government this summer put in place restrictions under the Export Control Act on the dissemination of information that might be used against the UK. The research councils, universities and bodies like the Wellcome Trust, which fund research, lobbied hard to make sure that ministers did not strangle scientific or scholarly work for fear of it falling into the wrong hands. </p> <p>Scientists will be warned if the government thinks their work could be used to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), or if they suspect it themselves - that covers personal communications as well as software and academic papers. For the moment researchers seem happy that freedom to research and collaborate internationally remains intact. Nick Winterton, of the Medical Research Council, said: \"None of the guidance would really place unreasonable constraints on researchers. You need to have some suspicion that the people you are dealing with are using the information for WMDs and, under those circumstances, I can't imagine any sane researcher is going to feel that's a restriction on their activities.</p> <p>\"I don't think, at the moment, we have any reason to fear that the regulations in the Export Control Act are going to damage normal scientific research, collaboration and development,\" said Mr Winterton.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Moore will not submit Fahrenheit 9/11 for consideration in the best documentary category at this year's Academy Awards - but he will try for best picture.</p> <p>Moore and his producing partner, Harvey Weinstein, believe the documentary will stand a better chance if they focus solely on the top Oscar. </p> <p>But while best picture would be a massive scoop for Moore, he has his sights set on an even bigger prize later this year. \"For me the real Oscar would be Bush's defeat on November 2,\" he said.</p> <p>Moore's decision not to put Fahrenheit 9/11 forward for the documentary award was also influenced by his wish to be \"supportive of my teammates in non-fiction film\", referring to films such as the fast-food satire Super Size Me, and Control Room's sober look at Arab television news. </p> <p>Moore, who won the best documentary Oscar last year for Bowling for Columbine, says he would like to give others a chance at the honour. </p> <p>He can afford to be generous. Fahrenheit 9/11, which cost only $6m (\u00a33.36m) to make, has so far taken a sensational $117.3m (\u00a365.8m) at the US box office, despite an early roadblock when the Walt Disney Co banned its Miramax Films division from distributing the politically controversial film</p>",
  "<p>When Stephen Carter was appointed to run Ofcom, the media industry's first super-regulator, there was little sound coming from the chattering classes - their jaws had universally dropped. </p> <p>At the time of his appointment, Carter was an unemployed 38-year-old whose last job was presiding over the bankruptcy protection proceedings of NTL, the cable company crushed by \u00a312bn of debt. </p> <p>Nineteen months on, most media commentators say it is too soon to pass judgment on the regulator - or on Carter's influence. An early report card would probably say it has surpassed expectations but has yet to deliver on its promises. </p> <p>Lord Currie, the Ofcom chairman who helped make the appointment, recently raised a glass to the decision with his deputy, Richard Hooper. \"Had we made a different appointment, Ofcom would have been a totally different organisation,\" he says. </p> <p>Carter does score well on sheer industriousness. Nearly all those interviewed, from those who remember him as a graduate trainee to his Ofcom colleagues, mention his prodigious work rate. </p> <p>Lord Currie said: \"He is a very hard worker and works people hard ... If there is any fault, it is that he drives himself too hard.\" </p> <p>Tim Suter, Ofcom partner in charge of content and standards, says one of Carter's strengths is \"restlessness\" which \"can be tiring for the rest of us\". </p> <p>Such hard work has produced the blizzard of consultation documents and reports that characterised Ofcom's first year. It is also necessary if the regulator is to fulfil its challenge to tackle big industry issues: public service broadcasting, digital switchover and telecommunication pricing, to name a few. </p> <p>It has also made Ofcom much more noticeable, says Lord Currie. \"In the TV area they have seen more of us in six months than they saw of ITC [the former regulator] in six years.\" </p> <p>Harry Macauslan, the deputy chairman of advertising agency JW Thompson, compares Carter with a \"swan, with lots going on under water\", an effortless style that accompanied a mad dash from graduate trainee to chief executive by the age of 30. </p> <p>Macauslan, who remembers Carter as a fresh-faced graduate, believes the industriousness runs deeper than pure ambition. \"Scottish puritanism runs through him, He does things because he thinks he should.\" </p> <p>Even his hobbies are characterised by this sense of utilitarianism. Golf is taken up because \"it's a social tool\". </p> <p>Carter, Macauslan says, is a deeply moral and political man. \"He's not a great hedonist and very rarely lets go .... He is always in control. He's a bit scary in that way.\" </p> <p>Carter is intensely private. He is married to Anna, an Australian whom he met at JWT, and has a young family, but other than a regular dinner date with David Currie and his wife, he rarely socialises with work colleagues. He has many friends and associates; hundreds of guests are expected to attend the couple's joint 80th birthday party at their country house this month. </p> <p>\"He is certainly not a lad,\" says Macauslan. Perhaps fittingly for a man now spearheading a 21st century experiment, he is more akin to a \"19th century pioneer\". </p> <p>From the beginning of his career, Carter was focused and intelligent.\"Stephen was fabulously ambitious and remarkably good at what he did,\" says Macauslan. \"He always made people above him feel slightly uncomfortable.\" </p> <p>He was also self-confident enough to wear Frank Spencer-inspired knitted tank tops in a trendy ad agency. He still drives a Mini. </p> <p>A sense of humour leavens Ofcom's apparently stakhanovite work rate. Several close colleagues says Carter is \"fun\" to work with. Sandra Jenner, director of human resources, says she \"laughs a lot\" at work. </p> <p>The only criticism of a man praised for charm and communication skills is that he does not appear to have the common touch. Although several people cite his ability to stand up for almost three hours and give a rallying speech to some 800 employees last year, Carter is accused by some of running an exclusive, even cliquey, operation. </p> <p>Speak to more junior members of Ofcom and many feel they don't get enough time with the boss. </p> <p>Even his close associates recognise this. One senior member of staff admits: \"If you're not part of that culture [at the top] it must feel a very windy and lonely place.\" </p> <p>Jenner says: \"People can think he is dismissive when I think ... his brain is operating very fast and he knows he has a lot of work to do.\" </p> <p>A former colleague at NTL, who declined to be named, says Carter always preferred negotiating with industry stars rather than talking to junior members of the troubled company. \"He likes talking to bigwigs like ministers, senior civil servants and industry chiefs, rather than operational staff.\" </p> <p>This led to criticism at NTL: \"He was more interested in the product than the service, he liked dealing with Sky but the reality of that business is that, as long as the televisions, phones and internet connections work, it's OK.\" </p> <p>Carter's seeming regard for industry bosses is mutual. Media executives like his light-touch regulation and the sense that he was not so long ago one of them. </p> <p>Christy Swords, ITV's director of regulatory affairs, says: \"It has been refreshing for us to deal with someone ... who actually has more past experience of being regulated.\" </p> <p>Other words used to describe his leadership style by industry executives are \"approachable\" and \"open\". </p> <p>His ad-speak causes some mirth. One industry executive, who also declined to be named, says Carter opened their first meeting by saying: \"I've always believed that you get more flies with honey than with vinegar.\" </p> <p>When asked what his greatest achievement has been, most of those interviewed suggest it is putting an effective team together and getting Ofcom running so effectively. </p> <p>Tim Suter says: \"Within a very short space of time he took something that had been designed in committee over many years and turned it into something that had a culture and anambition.\" </p> <p>Some even praise Carter's performance at NTL. Stuart Ross, former finance director, says Carter's greatest achievement was \"getting NTL through the restructuring\". </p> <p>Carter's reputation is still blemished, however, by the cable company's collapse. One former colleague, who opted to remain anonymous, said Carter showed little understanding for consumers. \"He did not understand the need to cut costs and improve customer service quickly enough.\" </p> <p>That critic wondered where a slight preference for economic, strategic and structural issues over consumer-oriented ones would take Ofcom. </p> <p>His career failures have been few, however. One old friend says: \"Stephen doesn't do mistakes.\" </p> <p>At Ofcom, insiders blame the speed of execution for some errors. \"To take some risks it means you may make some mistakes,\" says Jenner. </p> <p>Currie admits to one error, putting out consultation on newspaper mergers. \"We didn't realise just how sensitive it was going to be,\" he says. \"It was an example of a thing that could have been handled better.\" </p> <p>The jury is still out. Christy Swords at ITV says: \"The heavy lifting for Carter is probably still to come. </p> <p>\"Implementing digital switchover, helping shape the BBC charter review process, not to mention some hugely important and complex work on the telecoms side - these are the areas which Carter knows over the next few years will really establish Ofcom's reputation.\" </p> <p>As well as that of Stephen Carter. </p> <p>As a snapshot of performance we have drawn up a list of 10 qualities of an effective manager. </p> <p>Assesors, marking anonymously, were asked to award scores out of 10. </p> <p>Stephen Carter scored so highly that one assessor asked us to change the list. Carter, we were told, is such a consummate manager we would have to ask about \"softer\" issues such as patience or work-life balance in order to get a truer measure of the man. </p> <p>His vision, leadership and communication skills were almost universally admired. He is also a fantastic networker. Lord Currie says: \"He puts me to shame. He knows everybody.\" His lowest mark, an average 5.4, was due to time management. His morning meetings are the only ones that run on time. He is too much of a leader to be a strong teamworker. One ex-colleague likens him to Michael Caine's character in the Italian Job when he says: \"Right, we're going to work as a team.

  "<p>The LGA today sets out a manifesto, to join cause with the next Government; a partnership of equals to improve public services and devolve power to local people.</p> <p>Our manifesto argues that a bold and radical decentralisation is essential - to improve public services; to join together in each area the totality of public services; to make better use of the public's money; and to bring power closer to people.</p> <p>The UK is unique. Of all the major economies and democracies of the world, our government exerts the highest degree of central control over public services and local government. For a decade or more Government have sought to raise standards through increasing central control - they have introduced new plans, legislation, guidance, financial controls, targets, performance indicators, bidding systems and inspectorates. This has absorbed and wasted public money. It has weakened innovation, flexibility and responsiveness which are the hallmarks of the world's most successful public and private sector companies. It has eroded the energy and motivation of those who work across the public sector and has failed to harness their deeply held commitment to public service.</p> <p>It was different from this once.</p> <p>TV historian Tristan Hunt's \"Building Jerusalem\" shows, in the 19th Century, councils at the forefront of change. Local government used to be an engine of innovation. Nearly all public services that we now take for granted were invented locally. Running water, sewerage, gas, electricity, universal education, much of the health service, a safety net for the poor; all of these were pioneered by enterprising local corporations whose leaders were great men of their times such as Joseph Chamberlain and Herbert Morrison, who gave civic leadership and brought real social change to their cities. In this new century we see examples of this. Last month at the Olympics, it was the Athens City Mayor that provided visible leadership; in 2001 in New York, Giuliani brought the city together inspiring action and courage.</p> <p>The LGA's vision is of independent, self-governing communities. Communities that support themselves with, and through, their local elected representatives - free from central interference. Communities where people have a sense of pride, a sense of belonging and feel a responsibility to each other and to their community.</p> <p>In our manifesto we argue for decentralisation to local councils and through local councils so that we in turn empower local residents, local organisations and communities that we represent.</p> <p>At the core of our manifesto, we seek an enhanced role for local government in order to improve public services, to make better use of the public's money, and to improve the quality of life in our cities, towns and counties and communities.</p> <p>For this we need a bold decentralisation. Small incremental change is not enough. It is time for government and the political parties to get off the fence and support radical devolution. </p> <p>First we call on Government to consider and agree with local government, which are the very few aspects of public services that require national standards. The rest should be freed from central control mechanisms, plans, regulations, targets and financial constraints; local people should be left to assess local needs and decide local priorities.</p> <p>We must recognise that there has always been a difficulty in co-ordinating and joining central government. We believe that democratically elected, autonomous and accountable councils are best placed to join locally the totality of public services.</p> <p>We must build on the success of Local Strategic Partnerships and Local Public Service Agreements. The LGA is committed to go forward with Local Area Agreements and Public Service Boards which join public services together locally in Council-led governance across the public sector. Councils are now ready to offer to take on responsibility and to shift visible accountability from ministers to Local Government.</p> <p>Today the difficulties of co-ordination and ensuring the proper use of public money are more acute with the increasing number of new initiatives, task groups, quangos and agencies - unelected, unaccountable and many insufficiently audited. These quangos, trusts and agencies now spend more than four times that of local government. There must be a bonfire of quangos and a re-balancing back to accountable and democratic councils. The Government's 10 year plan for local government must therefore include a review of these national bodies and quangos.</p> <p>At the same time, we are calling for at least a halving of the \u00a3730m spent on inspection, and the much larger cost to local councils themselves.</p> <p>Too many managers across public services are forced to permanently look to Whitehall, its inspectorates and targets. This should be turned around. Local public managers should be allowed instead to look more to the customers, and to tailor their services accordingly. More use should be made of existing annual External Auditor reports. National inspection must be reduced, and be proportionate to risk.</p> <p>On funding for local government, local people should be able to see a clear relationship between the services they receive and what they pay in Local Tax. The useful work by the Ministerial Balance of Funding Review is too important to be kicked into touch. The LGA supported a number of options: reformed property tax; return of business rate with inflation safeguards; assigned income tax; and a basket of smaller taxes. The LGA and the public wait for a clear recommendation from Government and a sign up by other parties to rebalance local government funding.</p> <p>Local Government now has a track record of improving service delivery. A bold decentralisation to Local Government will release the huge potential of our staff. We are determined to take forward our commitment on efficiency and effectiveness. The LGA commits to work to see that within 3 years no council will be labelled 'poor' or 'weak' by the Audit Commission.</p> <p>Finally the need for decentralisation is essential because of democracy itself. The last General Election turnout was the lowest since World War 1. Polling shows that the problem is not apathy. It is frustration. Too many people feel that politicians of all parties are irrelevant to their lives. They feel they have no influence on the process. There is a cynicism about both competence and integrity. Trust is eroded.</p> <p>Yet the majority of issues that most concern the public are the local ones. Recent surveys show that the public regard councils as twice as relevant to their lives as government itself; and that the overwhelming majority wish to see councils, not government or agencies, delivering public services. The potential is real for a resurgence of civic pride and civic renewal. The democratic arguments for localism are irrefutable. They lie alongside the potential to dramatically improve public services. </p> <p>We see the UK now out of date. Left behind in an old centralist system of governance. One that ignores the turn of the tide of localism. The Local Government Association calls on the national political parties to say where they stand. Do they, or do they not, support a bold and radical decentralisation? Do they, or do they not, support a democratic localism?</p>",

  "<p>One in five children as young as 11 could be showing early signs of future heart disease, according to a new study. </p> <p>Tests on children aged 11-14 have revealed that 20% had damage to blood vessels which is normally seen in heart disease or stroke patients.</p> <p>Dr Faisal Khan, who led the study, has told of how the warning signs could lead to earlier detection of a potential heart disease, meaning children could change their diet or lifestyle to prevent a later heart attack.</p> <p>\"It does worry me,\" he told the British Association Festival of Science at Exeter University yesterday. \"These are early warning signs that we need to be taking some kind of action in children. These could perhaps give us predictions of people who might be candidates for later cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart disease.\"</p> <p>Dr Khan, from the University of Dundee, said that when he examined the blood vessels of 11-14-year-olds he was shocked. The results have been collated from a large study conducted in the 1980s of 158 children living in Dundee who were originally recruited for a larger study on breastfeeding.</p> <p>There was a strong connection, Dr Khan found, in children who showed signs of damage of blood vessels with raised blood glucose levels, or greater than average amounts of fat around the middle of their bodies.</p> <p>He told the association that his results showed changes occurring from a very early stage in lives.</p> <p>\"This is a stage in life where changes that have occurred are potentially reversible,\" he said. \"When we leave it into the 30s and 40s these factors become much more difficult to control.\"</p> <p>He added that testing of blood vessels could prove to be a stronger predictor of heart disease than cholesterol levels.</p> <p>Around 2.7 million people in the UK are living with heart disease.

  "Vladimir Putin takes all questions about his policy on Chechnya personally. He has good reason to: his failure to end significant rebel military resistance after launching his political career on the back of an invasion of Chechnya is his achilles heel. <p>So few inside Russia or outside will necessarily be taken in by his insistence, given in an interview with the Guardian and driven home by striking the table with his hand, that there is no link between his policies in Chechnya and events in Beslan.</p> <p>But that does not mean Mr Putin is wrong to say the aim of the raid was to destabilise the whole of the North Caucasus. </p> <p>Shamil Basayev, the Chechen warlord who has personally led two similar hostage-taking raids into southern Russia and Dagestan and who was thought to be closely involved with this one, makes no bones about it: he has said many times his aim is to establish a Muslim fundamentalist state that stretches from the Caspian to the Black Sea.</p> <p>This is an objective no leader of the Kremlin, no matter how liberal minded, could rationally tolerate. There are significant Muslim populations, as Mr Putin says, along the Volga, in Tatarstan and Bashktostan - but you do not have to travel as far as that to see the danger Basayev's strategy poses to the Russian federation.</p> <p>From the Caspian to the Black Sea there stretches a fraying patchwork quilt of states and peoples. Here are republics of the Russian federation few people outside Russia have even heard of, such as Adygeya republic, Karachayevo-Cherkesskaya republic and Kabardino-Balkarskaya republic. </p> <p>Many are Muslim, but hundreds of tribes and ethnically distinct peoples are jammed into a relatively crowded area of fertile land. North Ossetia, which is shoehorned between the slopes of two of Europe's highest mountains, the Elbrous and the Kazbeck, is one patch of territory that has known more war than peace. </p> <p>Ingush, Ossetians, Chechens, Cossacks, Orthodox Christians and Muslims have jostled for land and power in one of the most densely populated, multicultural republics in the Russian federation. </p> <p>If we are to believe the testimony - taken under duress - of an alleged hostage-taker captured alive and paraded on Russian television, this is the reason Chechen separatists targeted Beslan. The aim was, apparently, not only to hit back hard at Russia but also to light a fire that would burn throughout the region. </p> <p>This is not as far fetched as it sounds: the embers of the last war between the Ingush and the Northern Ossetians, 13 years ago, are still glowing and could yet reignite.</p> <p>Little is yet known of the identity of the hostage-takers, but survivors said the leader in the Beslan school siege introduced himself to his victims as Magas, or Magomed Yevloyev. Yevloyev is one notch worse, in Beslan's eyes, than an associate of Basayev - and it matters not that Yevloyev, a radical Islamist, led an identical raid a few months ago against Ingushetia in which many of his fellow Ingush were killed. </p> <p>The only fact that will count for Beslan's grief-stricken parents is that Yevloyev is Ingushetian. To understand why that is so important, you have to wind the clock back to 1992, 1944 or even 1917: here, as elsewhere in the Caucasus, larger events such as the Russian revolution are distorted through the prism of ancient local feuds. </p> <p>The conflict between the Ingush and the Ossetians that blew up in November 1992 was the first large-scale war in the newly born Russian federation. But it was not the first time the two nations, whose capitals, Vladikavkaz and Nazran, are only 13 miles apart, had clashed. </p> <p>With the outbreak of the revolution in 1917 the largely Christian Orthodox Ossetians, who had historically received privileges from the Tsarist regime, sided with the White Guards; the Muslim Ingush joined Bolshevik units, drawn not least by their promise to redistribute land. </p> <p>To the rest of Russia it was a civil war. But when it was over and the Bolsheviks had emerged as winners, the Ossetians called it a \"victory by Ingushetia\". </p> <p>In 1944 Stalin deported 1.5 million people from the North Caucasus and Crimea, forcibly resettling them in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kirgizia and Siberia. Chechens, Ingush, Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks, Balkars, Karachai and Meskhetians were all loaded into cattle trucks and thousands died in transit in midwinter.</p> <p>Noticeably missing from the list were the Ossetians, who were allowed to take part of the land - Prigorodny region, near the regional capital, Vladikavkaz - that the Ingush had been forced to leave behind.</p> <p>Rehabilitating the victims of Stalin's purges proved as thorny an issue as the deportations. In 1956 Nikita Khrushchev condemned the deportations in his \"secret speech\" to the 20th party congress, and later that year the Soviet government issued decrees on the restoration of the Chechen-Ingush autonomous republic, among others. </p> <p>The Ingush and Chechens returned to their lands but Prigorodny region stayed in North Ossetian control. Moscow also kept its two main military bases in the North Caucausus, in Vladikavkaz and Mozdok.</p> <p>While the liberal politicians in the final years of the Soviet Union advocated the full return of rights and property of all who had been repressed, the law was short on details. In the vacuum that was created, everyone started to grab power for themselves. Djokar Dudayev, a former Soviet air force commander, seized power in Grozny in 1991 and proclaimed Chechen independence. This left Ingushetia in limbo but it also left the Ingush free to pursue all territorial claims over Prigorodny. </p> <p>Tensions soon arose between the Ingushetian inhabitants of Prigorodny and their North Ossetian neighbours. Large numbers of Ingush were burned out of their homes. Moscow dispatched 8,000 troops, who took up positions on the border between North Ossetia and Ingushetia, reinforcing the North Ossetian case that Prigorodny was part of their country.</p> <p>Legend has it that it took the death of just one taxi driver to trigger a full-scale war. Of more than 40,000 Ingush who were forced to flee in that conflict, only half have returned to their homes 13 years later.</p> <p>Today something much worse than the death of one taxi driver has taken place. The tide of grief that is overwhelming the beleaguered parents of Beslan, who feel bitterly let down by their own republican government and by Moscow, could so easily turn into a wave of revenge. There are already reports of Ingush fleeing Prigorodny. </p> <p>The air is thick with threats. Moderates on all sides will have their work cut out to hold people back. Everyone is armed, anguished and angry. Present horrors fit into a template of recrimination and revenge that is as much part of the dramatic landscape of the Caucasus as the high mountains and their narrow, squeezed foothills.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Hearst is the Guardian's assistant foreign editor and was Moscow bureau chief between 1995 and 1997</p>",
  "The Department for Transport last night intervened in a BBC expos\u00e9 of security lapses at Manchester airport, citing national security for demanding a preview of the programme. <p>The BBC agreed that a government security expert could view the film, which is due to be shown tonight, to see if it reveals information that could be of assistance to terrorists. </p> <p>An undercover reporter, Michelle Cox, recorded dozens of hours of material while working as an aviation security officer at the airport between April and July. The programme, the first in a new BBC1 series Whistleblower, is understood to reveal a series of alarming lapses at the heart of security operation. </p> <p>Cox found problems with metal detectors, intended as the first line of defence against terrorists. On one occasion a machine failed to detect a 20cm (8in) knife carried by a manager on a test; the same manager then tested another machine in the same area with a large pair of scissors, which failed to set off the alarm, but passengers were still allowed to use it before boarding planes. </p> <p>She also filmed as staff apparently fiddled the records that were meant to demonstrate they had carried out the required number of bag searches. When she inquired about what was happening, the colleague said: \"We cheat.\" </p> <p>A supervisor adds: \"Every hour we get that figure, then we add it up, we divide it and subtract it and multiply it and turn it inside out and throw it out the window a couple of times and come up with this sort of figure. It tells us that you keep up to your ratios, keep up to your standards.\" </p> <p>In the film, Cox is seen boarding an aircraft left unlocked overnight. Over the 15 planes she inspected on the tarmac, two were unsealed, 12 had steps leading up to them - against DfT regulations - and one was fully open and unguarded. She also saw that staff were tipped off about the arrival of government inspectors. </p> <p>A spokeswoman at the transport department said last night that it took the allegations seriously, pointing out that it made announced and unannounced inspections. She said the DfT wanted to be sure there was no information that could compromise security, and hoped the BBC would comply with any requests for amendments. \"We have concerns that [the programme] could be of use to terrorists.\" </p> <p>The BBC insisted it had the final say on what would be broadcast. </p> <p>The film has taken the edge off what was meant to have been a triumphant autumn for the airport. Last month it reported record passenger figures and announced a leap in profits from \u00a360m to \u00a389m. </p> <p>In a statement, the airport said: \"Manchester airport's procedures, systems and equipment are part of a robust, effective defence system comprising several different levels, which changes and evolves as necessary. </p> <p>\"Together with regular reviews and inspections, this provides an intricate system of checks and cross checks which, taken together, provide a robust security net. The integrity of this security system works as a whole and is not dependent upon any one single element. </p> <p>\"We take any allegations of shortcomings extremely seriously and any breaches in procedure are rectified immediately.</p>",
  "The militant Iraqi group holding two French journalists hostage last night demanded a $5m (\u00a32.8m) ransom for their release and set a 48-hour deadline for the request to be met. <p>In a statement that could not be authenticated, the Islamic Army of Iraq suggested that it had been prepared to free the two men earlier but had abandoned the plan after a major military operation in Latifiya, south of Baghdad, at the weekend. \"We warn you not to bombard us as you did ... on the day when we intended to deliver them [the hostages] to you,\" the statement, posted on a radical Islamist website, said. </p> <p>The message appears to be the first confirmation for more than a week that Georges Malbrunot, 41, who works for Le Figaro, and Christian Chesnot, 37, of Radio France International, are still alive. </p> <p>The news came after several days of uncertainty during which the French government and various Muslim negotiators had repeatedly indicated that the signs were positive for the men's release, but the details of the handover were proving hard to finalise. </p> <p>The French prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, said the statement was being taken seriously. \"We are trying to check its authenticity, which is not established at this time,\" he said. Mr Raffarin told RTL radio the situation was \"worrying\", but added: \"Nothing is calling into question the confidence we have in a favourable outcome of the situation.\" </p> <p>As well as setting the ransom, the kidnappers called for a truce with Osama bin Laden and demanded a promise of no military and commercial dealings with Iraq - demands that appeared to be directed at France. </p> <p>They would release the men if only one of their demands was met, they added. </p> <p>The French government now faces the dilemma of whether to pay the ransom, after the apparent failure of its earlier diplomatic efforts. </p> <p>The kidnappers appear to have been rattled by a huge raid last weekend by Iraqi police and US troops in Latifiya, the rural Sunni town 40 miles south of Baghdad where the journalists were almost certainly seized last month while travelling to Najaf. More than 500 suspects from Latifiya were rounded up in a seven-hour operation. </p> <p>After taking the men hostage, the kidnappers at first said they were giving France 48 hours to revoke a controversial law banning all conspicuous symbols of religious faith, including Islamic headscarves, from state schools. Paris refused, and the law came into effect last Thursday. </p> <p>The kidnappings stunned France, which was strongly opposed to the war in Iraq and is seen as one of the west's most pro-Arab countries. </p> <p>An impressive diplomatic offensive by Paris has since resulted in expressions of support from numerous Arab countries and several Islamist groups. </p> <p>Yesterday's ransom demand came as a car bomb exploded just north of Falluja, killing seven US marines and wounding several others, in the deadliest attack on the US military in Iraq since May. </p> <p>The blast, nine miles from the Sunni town, destroyed two Humvees, witnesses said. Medical teams in helicopters carried away the injured, and troops sealed off the area. </p> <p>Four Iraqis were wounded when US troops opened fire afterwards, Ahmed Bassem of the Falluja general hospital told the Associated Press. </p> <p>US forces have not patrolled inside Falluja since April, when they withdrew after a three-week siege. Since then the town and neighbouring Ramadi have come under the control of the Sunni resistance. </p> <p>Yesterday, meanwhile, another militant group released a Turkish driver it had taken hostage. He was freed after the company he worked for said it was withdrawing from Iraq.</p>",

However, cancer is generally a disease of old age and more people now live longer because the very research she opposes has led to effective prevention and treatments for diseases from which millions used to die before reaching old age - smallpox, whooping cough and polio, to name three. </p> <p>This country has some of the most tightly regulated animal research and some of the world's best biomedical scientists. As a nation, we cannot have it both ways. The improvement in length and quality of life we have experienced over the past 50 years, as a result of improved and safer medicines, has only come about because of research involving animals.<br> <strong>Prof Chris Higgins</strong><br> Director, Medical Research Council </p> <p>Of course, Karen Dawn, in her wildly inaccurate account of research using animals, dare not dwell on one fundamental aspect - British people do not agree with her. No one, scientists included, wants unnecessary animal experiments. However, that does not mean we disagree with the concept of cost to the animal and benefit to the patient (animal patients too, by the way) that justifies experiments for the purpose of medical advancement. Some 87% of us, according to a Mori poll in 2002, can accept such research provided there is no alternative and suffering is minimised. Those conditions are met under British law and practice. </p> <p>Animal research is only a small part (around 10%) of the effort to find better treatments. And, despite Dawn's assertion to the contrary, these efforts are having an impact. To take her example of cancer, the death rate from cancer has decreased by 12% over the past decade.<br> <strong>Philip Connolly</strong><br> Director, Coalition for Medical Progress</p>",
  "<p>Church of England and Roman Catholic bishops have united to condemn as misguided and unnecessary a bill allowing carers to help people die. </p> <p>Although the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill bill is a private member's motion - sponsored by Lord Joffe, the former chairman of Oxfam and a human rights lawyer - and stands little chance of becoming law, it has reached a Lords select committee and the bishops' action is a pre-emptive move to stop it getting any further. It is unusual for both sets of bishops to oppose legislative proposals jointly. </p> <p>The bill would enable terminally ill people to be helped to die if that is their settled wish, having been informed of the medical alternatives. </p> <p>In a covering letter, Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury and Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales, warn: \"We believe very strongly that respect for human life at all its stages is the foundation of a civilised society and that the long-term consequences of any change in the law to allow euthanasia in limited circumstances would be immensely grave.\" </p> <p>The bishops claim the bill's definition of a \"unbearable suffering ... which the patient finds so severe as to be unacceptable\" is too subjective and that its application to those whose death is likely to result \"within a few months at most\" is too vague. </p> <p>They claim: \"It is deeply misguided to propose a law by which it would be legal for terminally ill people to be killed or assisted in suicide by those caring for them, even if there are safeguards to ensure it is only the terminally ill who would qualify. </p> <p>\"To take this step would fundamentally undermine the basis of law and medicine and undermine the duty of the state to care for vulnerable people.\"</p>",
  "<p>The dreaming spires of Oxford University have long been a bastion for liberal greenies, people who like to slow the traffic by marching to save the whales. But Oxford is rapidly becoming home to another brand of environmentalist, one who wants to join big business and change it from within. And one who wants to take pragmatic steps to mould our relationship with the environment. </p> <p>The masters course in environmental change and management is something of an explosive mix. People with wildly varying backgrounds converge from all over the world for an intense training in the critical issues of environmental policy, only to scatter themselves a year later in diverging sectors of employment. </p> <p>Sumalee Khosla, an Indian biology graduate, has spent several years in management and came to the course hoping to link her former life as a scientist with her experience in business. American Carolyn Snyder came from a heavily research-influenced background involving environmental studies, geology, chemistry and physics. </p> <p>There are non-scientists, too. Megan Ceronsky, an American graduate in international relations, felt her background fitted perfectly with dealing with the decidedly uneven environ mental policy of the Bush administration. \"The US is a huge challenge and my own fields are probably best suited to trying to address that. The course for me is a background in science, and science as it is useful to policy,\" she says. </p> <p>For Kunal Mehta, an environmental studies graduate from India who wants to specialise in how best to produce energy for a rapidly expanding developing world, the course is a way of opening doors into areas of work he might otherwise have skipped over. </p> <p>Ishmael Dodoo, a Ghanian, wants to use his experience to push his country to acknowledge and begin to deal with the degradation of the African environment. \"Compared with the UK, environmental concerns are not very important in Ghana,\" he says. \"It's not something people really think about.\" </p> <p>Such a broad intake of nationalities and disciplines mirrors what John Boardman, director of the course and a reader in geomorphology at Oxford, says is crucial to current environmental policy-making. \"Gone are the days when the building of a dam is a matter of an economic analysis and an engineering report,\" he says. \"Today the needs of indigenous peoples or water-users also need to be considered.\" </p> <p>His interdisciplinary approach has undoubtedly been a success: 10 years on and with nearly 300 applications a year for 30 places, it is one of Oxford's most sought-after courses. Students from 48 countries have passed through the doors of the Environmental Change Institute, and its alumni occupy positions of influence around the world in environmental consultancies, national governments, the EU and the UN. \"At the Hague 2000 Kyoto protocol meeting, 13 alumni were representing governments and NGOs [non-governmental organisations],\" says Boardman with some pride. </p> <p>The competition for places inevitably filters only the most committed and ambitious. This is a group of students who are clear not only where their aspirations lie, but about how to persuade the world at large to be more environmentally conscious. </p> <p>They recognise that campaigning and educating the general public on their subject has to be more subtle than angry flag-waving. \"This generation of environmentalists doesn't go to extremes,\" says Khosla. \"They tend to get into mainstream businesses in a way which is much more effective than trying to be sensational about things.\" </p> <p>But a hint of anarchy remains. \"Direct action still has a role to play - there are certain issues people need to get angry about,\" says Jonathan Avis, a British geography graduate who sees himself working for an NGO in the future. </p> <p>And meeting the original enviromentalists is an important part of the course. Field trips include visits to the Lake District and South Downs, with talks by experts on traffic, farming, planning and tourism. Three years ago, the students met Lakeland farmer Willie Tyson, hailed as their favourite lecturer after a farmyard discussion of economics and sustainability. \"Teaching quality assessment may have problems with that one,\" quips Boardman. </p> <p>Being exposed to so many different ideas has worked well and the students already have some big plans. Avis, for example, argues that people still do not feel personally responsible for the state of the planet. \"I don't think it goes down to the individual enough. People read about it and, if it doesn't affect them directly or their children, then it really goes over their heads,\" he says. </p> <p>But Ceronsky argues that perhaps the only way to reverse environmental damage is to remove responsibility from the individual: \"Instead of look ing at behaviour change, should we be looking to change the context in which behaviours are taking place so that those behaviours are no longer so environmentally destructive?\" </p> <p>She says, for example, that there is a role for the development of a new technology to move to a renewable energy-based economy. When the environmental implications of energy consumption are not as damaging as they are today, it will cease to be an issue that needs constant attention at individual level. </p> <p>A trip to the Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales outlined the progress already being made on that front. But it also brought frustrations. </p> <p>\"The feeling I got after staying in that alternative energy centre was that it's unfortunate it's still seen as alternative,\" says Mehta. \"Centres like this breed the notion of these things being alternative. I don't think there's enough effort to make us feel it is not alternative, it is commercially viable.\" </p> <p>And with this realisation comes responsibility. Because it will be this unsatisfactory world of oil companies and suspicious members of the public that students from this course will have to engage with and, ultimately, change. </p> <p>But whatever they end up doing, the spires of Oxford may be serene in the knowledge that noisy marching probably won't be involved.</p>",
  "<p>The threat of a national shortage of care homes for older people intensified today with the disclosure that nearly 10,000 places were scrapped in Britain last year.</p> <p>Laing &amp; Buisson, the sector's leading analysts, said 585 private residential homes closed as owners cashed in on higher property values. This left 89,000 fewer places than at the peak in 1996. </p> <p>The latest closures left a perilous shortage of places to house an expected increase in numbers of older people needing supported accommodation. </p> <p>The most recent government forecasts indicate that demand for places would nearly treble from 444,000 residents in 2004 to 1,200,000 by 2051. </p> <p>William Laing, author of the report, said the reduction in places had not caused a problem over the past four years, due to the lower birth rate during the first world war. This had depleted the number moving into advanced old age. </p> <p>But he said: \"That period is now over. We project an increase in underlying demand for care home places of about 14,000 across the UK in the year to mid-2005.\" </p> <p>Some of the extra demand could be satisfied by expanding home care arrangements, as the government intended. \"Nevertheless, we believe it is imperative that commissioners of care services focus on the need to rebuild traditional care home capacity as well,\" he said. </p> <p>He added: \"There are few areas where fees are sufficiently high to justify new capital investment in new care home facilities for state-funded clients.\" </p> <p>Simon Burns, a Conservative health spokesman, said the erosion of care home places \"is causing excessive harm and misery to thousands of elderly and vulnerable people\". </p> <p>Sandra Gidley, the Liberal Democrats' spokeswoman for older people, said: \"The care home sector is in meltdown yet the government sits idly by. While ministers twiddle their thumbs, the victims of these closures are vulnerable elderly people whose lives are lost through the trauma of an eviction from what they thought was their home for life.\" </p> <p>The National Care Homes Association said: \"After successive years of home closures, we remain frustrated and disappointed at the lack of any real action to stop the haemorrhage of care home beds.\" </p> <p>A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"We do not accept the view that an increase in the number of older people in the coming years will inevitably result in an increase in demand for places in care homes. </p> <p>\"Successive generations have different ideas about how they will spend their old age. For many, retaining control and independence at home through the use of a direct payment, or living in an extra care facility with their own front door is what they really want and what we aim to achieve for the vast majority of older people.\"</p>",
  "<p>The charities watchdog has shut down the charity behind an evangelical church after an investigation found evidence of misconduct and mismanagement, including unauthorised payments to its pastor, it has emerged.</p> <p>Pastor Douglas Goodman, of the Victory Christian Centre, north London - who along with his wife and a number of the trustees received \"significant unauthorised salary payments\" - was jailed for three years in May for sex attacks on members of his congregation.</p> <p>He had been credited with building the Victory Christian Centre (VCC), a registered charity with a 2001 income of \u00a33.5m, into one of the most powerful black churches in Europe. The pastor also became personally wealthy, owning a \u00a31m house and a fleet of cars that included a Ferrari.</p> <p>The Charity Commission's investigation was sparked by allegations made in April 2002 that large sums of the church's money had been \"misapplied\" and that the pastor and his wife had received personal benefits from its funds.</p> <p>The commission's inquiry report, due to be published later today, says the investigation found that the trustees were not in control of the charity and did not know how its money was being spent. Goodman signed most cheques as sole signatory, in breach of the charity's constitution.</p> <p>A receiver and manager sent in to take over the running of the charity found that the church had also run up large debts and could not pay its creditors. This led to the church being closed down on December 18 2002.</p> <p>The inquiry report does not state how much of the charity's money was spent in unauthorised payments to Goodman, nor does it specify the level of debt. But the charity's accounts the year ending March 31 2002 reveal that one employee was paid between \u00a380,000 - \u00a390,000, while another was paid between \u00a390,000 - \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>The report says the charity was formally removed from the charities register last month. The watchdog ruled out moves to recover unauthorised benefits paid to trustees as disproportionately costly.</p> <p>The closure of VCC - and the separate jailing of its pastor - are exceptional. But the rapid growth of evangelical churches and the tradition of paying pastors from tithes raised from the congregation have highlighted questions about how well they can fit into the structure of charity law.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the 10,000-strong Kingsway International Christian Centre (KICC) threatened to walk away from its \u00a325m assets and abandon its charitable status after interim managers were sent in by the Charity Commission.</p> <p>The church had also begun to organise a demonstration in London's Trafalgar Square amid allegations - denied by the charity commission - that the watchdog was acting in a racist manner and had failed to understand how the black Pentecostal church operated. </p> <p>An agreement was later reached between KICC and the commission to settle outstanding issues and transfer the church's assets to a reconstituted charity. </p> <p>The commission is now working with the African and Caribbean Evangelical Alliance on model governing documents for churches that are also registered charities, to ensure they include proper provision for any payments made to pastors. Similar model documents have been drawn up for school parent-teacher associations. </p> <p>Under current charity law, trustees must not be paid for their trusteeship, although they may be paid for professional service if this is specified in the charity's governing documents or with the permission of the charity commission. The draft charities bill, now being discussed by a parliamentary committee, includes measures to make such payments easier.</p> <p>Mary Cridge, the head of customer service at the Charity Commission, stressed: \"Most independent charitable churches are well run and deeply committed to their congregations. There have however, been some anomalies between charity law and the way that pastors are sometimes paid. </p> <p>\"Working closely with the African and Caribbean Evangelical Alliance to deepen our understanding of independent churches has been of great benefit, and will result later this year in the launch of new governing documents for independent churches.\"</p>",
  "<p>A couple of years ago, while judging a poetry competition in a boys' grammar school, the headteacher told me that as a punishment to unruly pupils he often gave them a poem to learn by heart, something \"classic\" such as Wordsworth's Daffodils, Blake's Tiger or Keats's On a Grecian Urn. Setting aside the question of what is classic, I was appalled by the notion that poetry should be an alternative to writing lines from the blackboard. This could, the head continued in all seriousness, take place in detention or as part of the pupil's homework. </p> <p>Such a blinkered notion of poetry as punishment reinforced my view that some in education have very little awareness of what poetry is about, and continue to perpetuate a myth that poetry is bunk in the real world. And this, I'm afraid, also applies to higher education. </p> <p>Although senior management in universities pays lip service to a literary culture by occasionally appointing resident poets, it could be argued that poetry and HE management have as much in common as quantum physics has with bird-watching or stamp-collecting. Having held residencies in several universities and further education colleges over the years, I've noticed a startling commonality running through my experiences that is quite revealing. </p> <p>First, depressing as it may sound, it doesn't seem that management wants to commit itself to poets for more than a fixed period of time, a year or two at most. I suppose this is partly because they find it difficult to assess the poet's contribution to students' overall work. Universities can measure the work of academic staff by referring to performance indicators, but they have no real mechanism to measure the effectiveness of the work poets do. Perhaps, as a result, even some lecturers tend to be a little wary of poets, eyeing them with a hint of suspicion and keeping them at bay. </p> <p>So a poet is often left to his own devices, qualifying and quantifying the work undertaken at the end of each semester as if he were a business analyst. As one line manager said to a poet, the idea is to be as entrepreneur ial as possible. </p> <p>Naturally, the hapless resident poet will, therefore, do the obvious entrepreneurial stuff: set up creative writing workshops; set up and supervise the running of a literary publication; invite other poets to read at the university; offer consultation to students wishing to take up writing as a career; act as a PR/marketing object for the host university - and generally spread the word of poetry. </p> <p>It is only if the poet has a second degree related to literature or language that he will be invited to teach on one or two English modules, which will (hopefully) have a course description setting out the syllabus. Apart from that, the poet will be out in the dark. </p> <p>As a result, the poet, in turn, will set up everything on a temporary basis, with a view that it might not continue when he has left. Senior management rarely makes poetry and its long-term objectives a priority unless its presence can contribute significantly to a department's research assessment exercise score. </p> <p>However, such is the nature of HE funding that one can't blame the management completely. Take the widening participation fund given to universities by central government, in part to encourage pupils from socially disadvantaged inner-city schools to continue into higher education. This has partially sponsored the work of a number of poets who work with students in schools and colleges. But from this academic year, it will no longer be available. Instead, individual faculties can, at their discretion, allocate money from their own budget to target this area. </p> <p>It is also the case that some senior managers show very little commitment towards the artist and his work. And as for knowledge of the poet's style and themes, it sometimes makes him wonder if they have read his work. Some may even be members of the \"I don't know much about modern poetry but I know what I like\" brigade, who will chat to the poet and rubbish modern poetry at a singular puff ofexasperation. Perhaps the poet should consider providing poetry awareness workshops for senior university staff _ </p> <p>Some managers have only a vague concept of how poets work and their reliance on inspiration and creativity. Many come from a science or business-related background and sometimes their language reflects this. Recently a manager asked me to produce a business plan that would justify and quantify the value of the work I did with students in the English department. </p> <p>Bizarre as it might sound, he could not see a correlation between the study of literature, in which intertextualisation is a core part, and the creative process employed by poets. Instead he wanted a PowerPoint presentation. </p> <p>The use of a poet in a university can become a purely synthetic exercise, which the poet has to learn to live with. The work of a resident poet has got to be taken seriously if it is to have any real impact, or creative or educational value. </p> <p>Perhaps management could consider that resident poets need a brief, some kind of job description that will enable them to prioritise their work. It's no good simply saying \"develop a literary culture in the university\". That is far too vague to have any real meaning. </p> <p>The poet needs clearly defined directives. Senior managers have to be precise, pinpoint the overall aims for the poet, work with him on a detailed plan of action as to how those aims are to be attained, and agree on a set of realistic targets for the immediate and long-term future. Essentially, the poet needs to know just how he will fit into the grand scheme of the university's five- or 10-year plan. </p> <p>In particular, funding has to be carefully organised for a longer period of time, to give the poet a degree of financial security. For the work to be effective, the poet needs the collaboration of, and commitment from, the whole university. Or, at very least, the department in which he is housed. </p> <p>Without this, at the end of his tenancy, the poet will move on, frustrated and demoralised, hoping his next post will be better, and that he might encounter managers who have the same passion for poetry as he does. <br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Roshan Doug is a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and formerly poet-in-residence and visiting professor in poetry at the University of Central England.

  "<p>It's hard to tell whether you're sorry that your autocratic regime may be coming to an end, or pleased that you'll be getting some help in ensuring that 11 pupils turn up at the right time on the right day with the right equipment. Anyone who's ever given up more than half an hour of their free time to get a bunch of kids on to a soccer pitch will know the basic requirements are a sound understanding of logistics and crowd control. Sporting excellence - or even endeavour - is an accidental by-product. </p> <p>Rest assured that nothing will happen for the foreseeable future. It's all very well for the government to announce a few populist, attention-grabbing headlines in the middle of a successful Olympics, but it's a different ball game when it has to fund its ideas. </p> <p>Let's face it, sporting success doesn't come cheap. Since the lottery has been underwriting the athletes' training to the tune of millions of pounds a year, what have been Britain's most successful events in Sydney and Athens? Rowing, sailing, cycling and modern pentathlon. Now even someone with a devalued GCSE in maths would be able to tell you that getting that lot going in schools is prohibitively expensive. (Except for Eton, which has its own rowing lake.) All other schools will struggle to lay on the array of sports that are traditionally only encountered by the middle classes on a two-week Club Med holiday. </p> <p>If the point of getting specialists into schools is to up the medal count at future Olympiads, then the savvy way to go about this is to target the softer sports that no one really gives a monkey's about. Rhythmic gymnastics, synchronised swimming, ping pong, beach volleyball and softball - none of these are games that would raise a flicker of interest at a youth club. </p> <p>Come to think of it, they're not really sports at all, but you could still wind up with a bronze medal just for turning up because no one else is interested. If London wins its Olympic bid for 2012, we can probably add mud snorkelling to the mix, as the International Olympic Committee will be desperate to make sure we win at least one gold. </p> <p>Truth is, kids are a conventional bunch and the chances are they will want to do the same sports they always have: soccer, rugger, netball, cricket and track and field. In short, the very sports in which you are a specialist. Think about it. If you look around, who in Britain would you want to bring in to coach your kids? Bobby Robson has a bit of spare time now, but at 71 he's getting on and his recent track record of results has been abysmal. </p> <p>Now, it would be nice to get Kelly Holmes to coach your middle-distance runners, but what with a forthcoming appearance on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, she's going to be a bit pushed for time. Which will leave you with a few bods who fell over their hurdles in the heats to inspire your pupils. </p> <p>No. You're back on your own. Where you've always been. So get out there and give the kids hell. Your school needs you.</p>",
  "<p>Any would-be graduate student is only too aware of the research councils. These all-powerful colossi hold such sway over the moneybags that it seems one's entire academic future lies in their hands. </p> <p>So are the funding options exhausted once they have declined to cough up? Certainly, the choices are limited. \"Outside the research councils, there are very few sources,\" warns Dr Douglas Halliday, deputy postgraduate dean at Durham University. But there are options. </p> <p>Scottish student Francesco Rao left Edinburgh University with a 2:2 in biochemistry - \"so standard funding was impossible\" - but eventually secured masters funding from the department at Dundee through determination and a very sympathetic supervisor. </p> <p>For arts students in particular, dependent on the massively oversubscribed Arts and Humanities Research Board (only 28% of eligible applicants secured funding from the AHRB in 2003), it is essential to pursue all avenues. </p> <p>That said, scientists have it better even outside the research councils. \"Arts students don't have quite the same access [to funding],\" says Dr Joan Chandler, head of the graduate school and director of graduate studies at Plymouth University. </p> <p>The main options for UK students are university scholarships, charity or society funding, or support from employers. There are other alternatives for overseas students, who will find the British Council a useful source of <a href=\"http://www.britcoun.org\" target_new\"> advice</a>. </p> <p>With all funding, start looking around early, as competition is intense. One first point of call is the potential supervisor, who will be aware of the options and should be able to assist with applications. \"We encourage students before they apply to look for funding themselves and they will be in contact with the member of staff here in their particular area,\" says Chandler. </p> <p> <strong> University scholarships</strong> <br> </p> <p> Most universities have a range of internal scholarships for postgraduate students. \"We offer 15 fully funded doctoral fellowships,\" says Halliday. \"Three years of funding at home fees plus a nationally agreed stipend. Each department is invited to submit two nominations.\" </p> <p>Students apply in the first instance by specifying on their application for study that they would like to be considered for funding. Predictably, the university looks for academic excellence, strong references, a sound research proposal and a supporting statement from the relevant department, \"saying how they would fit into the strategy and contribute to the overall research of the department\". </p> <p> <strong> Charities and societies</strong><br> </p> <p> Of the charities, by far the best known is the <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.\" target_new\">Wellcome Trust</a>, which focuses on medical-related research and offers 12 four-year PhD placements on specific courses. The trust provides a four-year stipend as well as university fees for home students, and contributions towards laboratory rotation expenses, research expenses and travel. </p> <p>The substantial support provided is intended to attract high-quality applicants, the trust stresses, and it demands at least a 2:1 undergraduate degree. Applications are made to the individual programmes, and must be completed at least nine months before the uptake in October each year. </p> <p>That aside, it is very much a question of taking the time to look around and identify the right society or charity for a particular subject. Hero (Higher Education and Research Opportunities) points students in the direction of the Association of Medical Research Charities (www.amrc.org.uk), the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (www.jrf.org), the Leverhulme Trust (www.leverhulme.org.uk), the Royal Academy of Engineering (www.raeng.co.uk), the British Academy (www.britac.ac.uk) and the Royal Society (www.royalsoc.ac.uk). </p> <p>The Royal Institute of Philosophy (www.royalinstitutephilosophy.org) offers fellowships and bursaries to philosophy graduate students unlucky with the AHRB. But be aware that applications have to be returned in May, shortly after the AHRB deadline. </p> <p>\"There are smaller charities that offer funding but they are quite small schemes in comparison to the research councils,\" says Halliday. \"Mostly they can't afford to advertise.\" Again, he advocates consulting first of all with the supervisor, who will be \"more likely to identify sources of funding than students themselves\". </p> <p> <strong> Companies</strong><br> </p> <p> Arts students can pretty much forget this option. Keen as firms might be to support research into a cure for Aids, or even some new widget to put under the car bonnet, they are less likely to fund three years' study of Hamlet's soliloquies, or an obscure branch of metaphysics. </p> <p>However, scientists - even those already supported by a research council - can find employers a useful source of funding. According to Chandler, employers and industries are a principal source of non-research council funding, offering studentships or knowledge transfer partnerships (www.ktponline.org.uk). Essentially, the industry wants a specific project to be carried out and is prepared to fund it. </p> <p>But Rao adds: \"Most of the PhD students in our group are funded by an industrial company as a top-up, as council funding is not that much.\" </p> <p>Unless already connected to an employer, would-be students should, once again, begin by consulting their potential supervisor. </p> <p>If all this fails, it becomes a question of just how determined you are to get into postgraduate education. Career development loans are available for a number of vocational courses. They can provide tuition fees and/or living costs of anything from \u00a3300 to \u00a38,000. But, warns the National Postgraduate Committee, you need to be confident that the extra years in education will have an immediate pay-off in terms of gainful employment: you have to be able to repay the loan within six months of finishing the course. This explains, of course, why these loans are usually used for employer-friendly subjects such as law, business management or IT. </p> <p>For everyone else, that leaves self-funding, from savings, loans or gifts from relatives, or part-time work. It is hard to manage more than a day or so a week in paid employment when on a full-time course. However, many postgrads, especially on arts courses, opt to pursue the course part-time. </p> <p>A final note of optimism: those who stick it out through a masters are likely to find it easier to get funding for a PhD. \"There is a difference between masters and doctoral degrees,\" says Chandler. \"For masters students, the funding is not as extensive in range and the bulk of our masters students are self-funded. But for the PhD a large percentage have funding from all these diverse sources as obviously it is a pretty expensive thing to do.\" </p> <p>It is even possible (though it should not be relied on) that the AHRB or one of the research councils will fund PhD students whom they earlier rejected at masters level. Rao, two years on and working on a PhD in X-ray crystallography at Dundee, is now supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. </p> <p><strong>Wellcome Trust programmes</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> Cambridge </strong> Developmental Biology<br> </p> <p><strong> Cambridge </strong> Infection and Immunity <br></p> <p><strong> Dundee </strong> Molecular and Cellular Biology <br></p> <p><strong> Edinburgh </strong> Cellular and Molecular Basis of Disease <br></p> <p><strong> Glasgow </strong> Molecular Functions in Disease <br></p> <p><strong> Imperial </strong> Molecular and Cellular Basis of Infection <br></p> <p><strong> Leeds </strong> Molecular Basis of Biological Mechanisms <br></p> <p><strong> Liverpool </strong> Cellular and Molecular Physiology <br> </p> <p><strong> Manchester </strong> Biochemistry of Cellular Systems <br></p> <p><strong> Oxford </strong> Neuroscience<br> </p> <p><strong> Oxford </strong> Structural Biology: from Molecules to Cells <br> </p> <p><strong> UCL </strong> Neuroscience</p>",
  "<p>How on earth have we reached a situation where every tiny detail in education is laid down by the state? If \"creative teaching\" really is the government's aim for the future, how can schools shake off the suffocating embrace of nationalisation? </p> <p>Thirty years ago, ministers often said the only power they had was to shut temporary buildings in schoolyards. This orthodoxy had been confirmed by RA Butler during the 1944 Education Act debates. It was not for ministers, he declared, to tell schools what to do, as if by some obiter dictum , otherwise policy would lurch from whim to whim. </p> <p>In 1980, I wrote an article entitled \"State-approved knowledge: 10 steps down the slippery slope\". It was intended as a dire warning that a determined government could seize control of education and the minds of those within it. </p> <p>At that time we only had the first step, broad general aspirations, such as \"educate the whole child\". A senior civil servant described the article as \"unnecessarily alarmist\", saying no government would ever dream of going beyond step three, specifying which subjects should be taught and for what period of time. </p> <p>By the early 1990s all 10 steps of my Orwellian nightmare were in place, as the Conservative government introduced a legally enforced state curriculum, state tests, league tables, etc. Step 10 was reached when the first teachers were sacked for not teaching the national curriculum. Ministers took 366 additional powers in the 1988 Education Act, and their successors followed suit. Today state control is regarded as the norm. </p> <p>Recently I was asked to devise 10 further steps, but I refused. The original, meant to be a horror story, had become a blueprint. Why give the buggers even more ideas? Anyway, the next 10 steps are already there. Step 12 or so would be state-decreed minute-by-minute lesson plans - ie the literacy hour. Step 14 might be the 117-item state assessment schedule for five-year-olds. Step 16-ish is the hundreds of state-determined competencies prescribed for trainee teachers. Step 18 is the 2002 Education Act requirement to send in a form to the minister if you want to innovate. Step 20 came when state bureaucracy finally became satire, as the government set up two committees to look into the problems of duplication. </p> <p>Many teachers are too scared to innovate, so what steps are needed to drag us back up the slippery slope? Working against gravity is much harder than flowing with it. In political terms, power and control must be shed and devolved, rather than augmented, a gymnastic impossibility for many politicians. </p> <p>It is not just a case of turning back the clock. The future should distil the best of the past, while avoiding its cock-ups, and then add to it. A national curriculum is an entitlement, not just a legal prescription. Nor need anarchy prevail. Dropping Sats and league tables would not mean the end of assessment. Quite the reverse. It would allow better use of diagnostic testing, showing teachers what children need. </p> <p>National progress can be measured through sampling, instead of the current 25m annual tests. Monitoring the progress of five-year-olds need not involve over 100 largely meaningless state-imposed categories; there are better methods. Trainee teachers should concentrate on becoming skilful class managers, honing their powers of questioning and explaining, not on collecting ticks in official boxes. Ofsted should be helping schools to improve, instead of acting as the instrument of state terror and compliance. </p> <p>There is one huge obstacle. Power is a narcotic. For years politicians have become addicted to it in education. No sooner had the government announced schools were going to be set free than ministers were telling heads they must introduce uniform and a house system. Some freedom. </p> <p>Giving up control of the minutiae would be like coming off heroin: not a sign of weakness, but of strength. Unfortunately such detox is seen by anyone possessing power more as a fly pulling off its own legs and wings, one by one, until it can only hop around. The pain would be unbearable.<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ted Wragg is emeritus professor of education at Exeter University</p>",
  "<p>If it's green and wiggles, it's biology; if it stinks, it's chemistry; and if it doesn't work, it's physics. These words of wisdom and the image of a tousle-haired Albert Einstein sticking his tongue out set the tone for the homepage of the free, inspirational and fun key stage 3-4 maths/science website, <a href=\"http://www.skoool.co.uk\">www.skoool.co.uk</a>, produced by Intel and backed by the Association for Science Education (ASE) and the London Grid for Learning. </p> <p>Science teacher Andrea Coates uses Skoool with small, mixed-ability groups of 14- to 16-year-olds at the Reotas Centre in Skipton, a unit for the reintegration of permanently excluded pupils. </p> <p>The site, which introduces difficult stuff like Pythagoras's theorem in interactive, bite-sized steps and pathways, carries exercises ideal for mixed-ability classes with content linked to the national curriculum. </p> <p>\"With its numerous extension questions for SATs and GCSE exam syllabi, and its down-to-earth mix of theory and real world examples, Skoool delivers on all counts,\" says Coates. \"Teachers can customise the site to create their own lessons. </p> <p>They could select an introductory activity, follow up with a practical experiment and then conclude with revision exercises. The website can be downloaded at school or at home with an access code - ideal for students who have missed a lesson or who want to catch up.\" </p> <p>In fact, there is an enormous appetite among schools for good online resources, and Skoool is the latest in a growing number of free education websites published by companies, public sector organisations and charities. But how do teachers judge the value of free websites and incorporate them within the syllabus they are teaching? </p> <p>Peter Stevenson, manager of Gateshead City Learning Centre, assesses sites for over 30 schools in the area. \"We look at who's written it and who's put it up,\" he says. \"[We ask] is it just a company that's jumping on the bandwagon or has the material been written and developed by teachers? The reason why the BBC website <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools\">www.bbc.co.uk/schools</a> is so popular is that it has been carefully vetted. A good independent primary website we recommend is <a href=\"http://www.sparkisland.com.\">www.sparkisland.com.</a> It's full of educational games.\" </p> <p>Local authority ICT advisers are an excellent source of information about how to make best use of free websites. \"Teachers need to ask who's producing this website and why?\" says Irene Krechowiecka, e-learning development manager for Cumbria local educational authority. \"There's a lot of information about global warming, for example, on the American Petroleum Institute website but would you necessarily believe it?\" </p> <p>Phil McBride, an adviser on study support and ICT for Newcastle LEA, believes a good website must be engaging. \"We want to see colourful, well-designed pages with clear graphics and links to the national curriculum. We ask students for their favourite sites and we will post the best ones on our intranet. Young people probably spend more time on the internet than us - so why not make use of what they know?\" </p> <p>Free websites fall into several categories. There are the commercial sites produced as part of a big company's corporate social responsibility agenda. These include BT's citizenship website <a href=\"http://www.btplc.com/ict\">www.btplc.com/ict</a> and Shell's business study materials <a href=\"http://www.shell-livewire.org\">www.shell-livewire.org</a>. These sites are reviewed in resource directories by LEA ICT advisers, grids for learning and by <a href=\"http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk\">www.curriculumonline.gov.uk</a>. Teachers discover the best free websites and how to use them effectively through self-discovery or word of mouth. </p> <p>Some sites are produced by professional bodies, such as the Engineering Council, and charities, to raise an industry's profile. The sites are tailor-made for schools to fill a knowledge gap. One example is the young engineer site at <a href=\"http://www.youngeng.org\">www.youngeng.org</a> </p> <p>Museum sites are another source of inspiring online information. A good example is the Science Museum's much-acclaimed <a href=\"http://www.sparkingreaction.info\">www.sparkingreaction.info</a> Charities, too, can provide excellent background material. One example is the Greenpeace site (<a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk\">www.greenpeace.org.uk</a>) which offers material for projects on the environment, although it comes with a campaigning slant. </p> <p>The biggest producers of free websites are the national media and public sector, including regional grids for learning. Their content is generally independent and of good quality, as organisations like the BBC and Channel 4 have a lot of money to invest in communications and education. BBC Bitesize and Revisewise revision materials are well known to teachers at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/revision\">www.bbc.co.uk/schools/revision</a> </p> <p>Teachers pick and mix, relating content to the needs of their particular classes. At Seven Kings school, Ilford, head of English Paul Lindsay-Addy has a few basic ground rules for assessing the value of a free site. \"Our first priority is that it should have a pupil-friendly format. We want to see simplified schemes of work and, where appropriate, national literacy strategy objectives,\" he says. </p> <p>The sites he is using for key stages 3 and 4 are <a href=\"http://www.universalteacher.org.uk\">www.universalteacher.org.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.inspiration.com\">www.inspiration.com</a>, which comes complete with mind maps - a useful tool for literary criticism and analysing poems. </p> <p>But Lindsay-Addy advises his students to use revision sites sparingly. \"You can find a lot of information on websites, but I don't want to see students spending all afternoon googling away and producing a pointless rehash. Internet research needs to be focused, so I give students questions they must find answers to. Sites easily navigable and with learning objectives, such as <a href=\"http://www.english.uga.edu\">www.english.uga.edu</a>, keep students on task.\" </p> <p>Finally, be warned that there are now so many free websites that they are best used sparingly. Krechowiecka hates what she describes as the \"lazy teacher approach\", where pupils are directed to long lists of vaguely related websites to look up during or after the lesson. This merely encourages aimless clicking. </p> <p>\"Look for educational websites with deep links,\" she advises. \"Kids need to be given specific tasks and specific places to go.\" </p> <p>If you're worried about the suitability of a website, don't use it if it meets any of the following criteria: it carries pop-up adverts, does not fit in with the school syllabus, has a poor design, or has no links to the national curriculum. You have been warned.</p>",
  "<p>Year 9 take their seats in the well-equipped IT suite at Monkton Combe senior school, near Bath, with the air of an audience awaiting the start of the hottest show in town. </p> <p>Curtain-up doesn't disappoint. Exams are over for this term and John Wright, the head of physics, is about to introduce the class to a software package they will often be using next year. </p> <p>\"Yessss!\" says the curly-haired boy in the corner, clenching his fist in salute at the news. \"Computer games time.\" But before the games can begin, the students first need to get Krucible software up on their screens. Tricky. </p> <p>\"Log on, select Physics, select Physics Programs, select Krucible, click on Forces, Space Rescue,\" says Wright, with one eye on his own PC, and one eye on the large screen at his back. </p> <p>It's a small group, even by the standards of Monkton Combe, a Church of England school with a senior roll of 350, most of them boarders. Several overseas pupils have already returned home for the holidays, and others are at Navy camp, reducing the year 9 top set to 14 boys and two girls. Even so, Wright is energetic at winning the children's attention. \"Look this way. This way, James! This way, please!\" he urges as, with nods and prods towards the big screen, he demonstrates the steps each child needs to take to reach Space Rescue 2. </p> <p>The class is studying forces and projectiles and today's lesson is an online exploration of principles covered the previous week in what Wright describes as \"a practical\" but which his class would describe as \"when we made these wicked catapults with wire coathangers and spoons, and flicked ping-pong balls about.\" </p> <p>They are about to start \"flicking\" again, but within the confines of their PCs this time. Wright admits a full hour in front of a screen isn't his preference. \"I prefer to mix ICT with practical and written work and demonstrations. I build ICT into all my lesson plans. It adds to the variety and the excitement,\" he says. </p> <p>In his laboratory-classroom, there's an interactive whiteboard linked to his PC, and wireless laptops that the students can use indoors or out. \"For the transit of Venus, we were out in the grounds with computers, a screen and a telescope - great fun,\" he says. </p> <p>Space is being eyed today, too. Screens are filling with an image of two astronauts, one drifting helplessly at the edge of the blackness. Wright outlines the challenge: \"You are controlling Boris, and your mission is to rescue Steve. There are three forces you can control. You have to use them to place Boris next to Steve.\" </p> <p>The first attempts would cause alarm on the starship Enterprise. Some pupils are lost themselves, having accid-entally reverted to the main menu. Some are launching Boris so hard, there's a danger he'll burst through the side of the monitors; others are getting catty about their mouse. \"It won't work! Sir, I just can't make him move.\" </p> <p>Wright tours the room, trouble-shooting, until Nasa-worthy concentration is achieved and, one by one, the youngsters discover the exact balance of forwards, sideways and upwards thrust needed to put Boris alongside Steve and reel him to safety. </p> <p>After a quick recap of the main teaching point - forces change velocity - Wright calls up another \"game\", looking at how to plot a trajectory. </p> <p>\"Okay, leave your computers alone now, and look at the big screen. Come on - you need to watch this. I want you to fire the missiles and then plot the y and the x coordinates. Boys! You really do need to watch this. It's really tricky. This is what people get wrong. Just watch. I want you to adjust the force until you hit exactly 100 metres.\" </p> <p>His prediction is right. It is difficult. So much so that Wright himself, a confessed computer nerd, gets it wrong - or does he? His miss is a hit at stirring the class to competitive action. Soon, scores are being called from all parts of the room. \"I've got 105 metres!\" \"Is 99 metres all right?\" \"Sir, I've got 102 metres\", until Simon gets the first bull's eye. \"Yesssss! One hundred dead!\" </p> <p>As the session ends, Wright is pleased with the class's progress. Krucible is a new investment, chosen mostly because of its Waves application, and for its hover-craft game, which can be used to reward students who finish first. \"The forces section is probably a bit advanced for this group, but they've got on well, and it's good preparation for next year,\" he says. </p> <p>Wright then waits by the ICT suite for his next lesson, with a year 10 group. \"Oh-oh. It looks as if most of my set is already in there. This will be their second hour in front of a computer. Not good.\" </p> <p>True to expectations, the session starts shakily. With this class, he is using Interactive Physics software, also about projectiles, which this time are hurled by a medieval missile-launcher, the manganol. But the program is working slowly, provoking complaints and protests. </p> <p>Fortunately, Wright knows his computer-ware; he's actually written a netballing application for this program (to counter criticisms from girls that physics programs are more suited to boys). He suggests setting changes to speed up the game and gives the class the target distances to strike. </p> <p>It becomes a boisterous game, with Wright joining in. The students are asked to note the successful coordinates but the mood is more like playtime. \"Done it! Fifty metres spot on.\" \"Aaargh! I've broken my manganol.\" \"Well done, sir! You've got it in.\" \"Can we access this in our own time?\" </p> <p>This set also made coat-hanger catapults last week. But which is better - the real or the virtual? The boy with the mangled manganol says: \"You get different things out of both of them. We did this really cool experiment on the braking distance of a trolley and we just laughed and laughed. But it's really cool working on the computers and sometimes it's the easiest way to work out what's really happening.\"</p>",

  "<p>Behind his desk there's a pile of door signs, exported from his old department. At the entrance to his new base at the University of Buckingham, above the estates office building, a quiet corner of a campus that rarely rouses itself much beyond sleepy, there's nothing yet to establish his presence. But Alan Smithers, the UK's most prominent education researcher, already knows his way around the market town, has moved into a rented house - on School Lane, naturally - and gives every impression of being at home. </p> <p>As August transfers go, Smithers' move from Liverpool University to Buckingham - taking his deputy, Pamela Robinson, and the rest of their Centre for Education and Employment Research (CEER) with him - wasn't quite in the Wayne Rooney league. But it did raise eyebrows. </p> <p>Smithers is an adviser to the all-party education and skills select committee, and has carried out research for organisations across the political spectrum, from the National Union of Teachers to the Department for Education and Skills to the Sutton Trust charity. Owing to his habit of informing topical education issues with interesting, evidence-based, fully-formed sentences delivered at shorthand speed, he is much in demand from reporters and has influenced more leader columns than you would care to realise. </p> <p>Now he has joined the only private university in the country, which has bolstered its arch-Thatcherite core by establishing an education department consisting of Anthony O'Hear, Chris Woodhead, Dennis O'Keeffe and visiting professor Roger Scruton. Not exactly over-run by Trots, in other words. Is Smithers more rightwing than people thought? </p> <p>\"No, I'm not at all rightwing. I am independent-minded. That's the key factor. I have been invited at one time or another to advise all three main parties. I've always turned it down,\" he says. \"If you are linked to any political party and you are coming at it from that direction, and you have to find out things that that party likes, you've got no hope.\" </p> <p>He had no qualms about coming to Buckingham. He started thinking about a move when Liverpool Univer sity, where he had been since 1988, took the \"extraordinary decision\" to merge its education department with its centre for lifelong learning. \"Clearly Liverpool wasn't going to be a propitious environment in the future.\" </p> <p>He mentioned his anxieties to Chris Woodhead, who told him of Buckingham's plans to develop the school of education and put him in touch with Terence Kealey, Buckingham's vice-chancellor. When they met, around Christmas last year, Kealey told Smithers that at 65 he was still younger than the age at which Churchill became prime minister; Smithers hopes the centre will be at Buckingham for a decade at least. </p> <p>\"It seems to me that Buckingham really represents the future of higher education,\" he says. \"It really does need to become much less reliant on government money. I'm very happy to throw my lot in with a university that's trying to point out the ways of doing it and the consequences of doing that. </p> <p>\"Higher education in Britain has got into a rather strange state. Successive governments since the late 70s have increasingly begun to act as a customer of higher education, and because they are a monopoly customer they are behaving a bit like Tesco's and Sainsbury's, making requirements of the producers of higher education. So you get these extraordinary things - like that our future doctors aren't being chosen on their capabilities, but on their school background. </p> <p>\"Really, the health of higher education depends on there being a plurality of funders so that if you are doing something that a particular funder doesn't like, there are other funders to smooth out the cash flow.\" </p> <p>That has been the model the CEER, now in its fourth home, has developed over the years, requiring as a condition of the contract that the research organisations ask them to produce is always put in the public domain. \"The difference is,\" he smiles, \"that if you find out something people like, they tend to publicise it a lot, but if you find out something that people don't like, perhaps it doesn't receive that much attention.\" </p> <p>He doesn't think the change of address will damage CEER's reputation - far from it. \"I'm banking on the independence of the university being its prime feature and backing up the independence of our educational re search, rather than anything to do with former chancellors [such as Baroness Thatcher, for instance] or the origins of the university.\" </p> <p>The trouble with his field, he acknowledges, is that it is riven with personal and political prejudice. \"Studying education is a lot more difficult than studying plants and rocks. In the physical world you can get evidence that will overturn your preconceptions: the idea that we are not on a flat earth doesn't seem to make common sense at all. People held very strongly to that view but a few measurements told us that this comfortable view of our circumstances just couldn't be held. </p> <p>\"In education you have equally strong views, but if people want to believe in selection, or mixed ability classes, or whatever, it's very difficult to come in with evidence of the quality that will overturn it ... there are a lot of people around in education who want answers to 'ought' questions and 'why' questions rather than being content with simple descriptions. They are wanting to know how education should happen and they are looking for that kind of answer from research and it simply can't give it to them.\" </p> <p>Education research, he says, is \"pretty poor at the moment\", with experts in other fields moving in and, pressured by the demands of the research assessment exercise, then beginning to justify themselves as university academics. \"They say 'what is education research?' Oh, it's giving out a few questionnaires, adding up the numbers, writing papers. They feel they need to be controversial, say something original - you are more likely to get published that way. You get these more and more outlandish ideas about education being promulgated by academic education.\" </p> <p>Smithers tries to stay above the party-political fray; that isn't the same as being uncritical. In an acidic chapter in the Anthony Seldon-edited overview of Labour's first term, The Blair Effect, Smithers accused the government of \"wilful neglect\" of higher education, of \"a cop-out\" on the structure of secondary education, and of creating a system where \"idea after idea seems to have come tumbling out, often encapsulated in a catchy two- or three-word phrase, without a full appreciation of the education system's capacity to absorb them or their relevance to ordinary pupils\". </p> <p>Three years on, Smithers is revising his view, a little bit. He praises Blair for grasping the nettle of top-up fees - no more wilful neglect there. He thinks the government's obsession with targets - which it keeps missing - has taken attention from \"tremendous improvements\" in literacy and numeracy in primary schools, and he is hopeful of serious progress in the early years. </p> <p>But he's worried about the forthcoming overhaul of 14-19 education. \"Tomlinson is a massive distraction. It's a bit like the Dome: instead of getting the A-levels right and getting some good vocational qualifications right, you are concerned about the covering.\" </p> <p>And he is even more dubious about secondary schooling. \"The specialist schools policy simply does not make sense. What happens if your child loves science and the only accessible school specialises in the performing arts? The academies are consuming an incredible amount of money and the figures are underplayed by not including land values. The admissions arrangements are a mess. </p> <p>\"Young people are required to be in education from 11 to 16 whether they want to be or not, so we owe it to them to provide equivalent opportunities. That involves putting a coherent shape on this phase of education and this is what the government has signally failed to do.\" </p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong> Name </strong> Alan George Smithers<br></p> <p> <strong> Age </strong> 66 </p> <p><strong> Job</strong> professor of education and director, centre for education and employment research, at University of Buckingham<br></p> <p> <strong> Before that </strong> professor and director of CEER at universities of Liverpool, Brunel and Manchester; lecturer at Bradford; lecturer in botany at Birkbeck and College of St Mark and St John, Chelsea<br></p> <p> <strong> Educated </strong> at King's College, London (BSc, PhD); Bradford University (MSc, PhD) </p> <p><strong> Likes </strong> walking, theatre </p> <p><strong> Dislikes </strong> bureaucrats </p> <p><strong> Married</strong> with two children</p>",
  "<p>It may be one of the hottest seats in Britain's public sector, but the occupant looks remarkably comfortable. Ralph Tabberer heads the Teacher Training Agency, responsible for finding over 30,000 people a year to fill the gaps in the nation's classrooms. </p> <p>At the agency's office in central London, Tabberer has several things to celebrate. The TTA is 10 years old this term. Teacher recruitment is up, with nearly 35,000 coming into training this year. The government has just handed the agency new responsibilities for establishing qualifications and training for the entire school workforce, including classroom assistants, caretakers and admin staff, as well as teachers. </p> <p>And there's a new advertising campaign, with a consciously relaxed feel, reflecting the idea that teaching is a more positive career choice than in the past. </p> <p>\"Go back four or five years and teacher recruitment was the biggest single risk to the standards agenda,\" says Tabberer. \"Today we have Ofsted describing new teachers as the best ever. We are bringing in better people than ever, more highly qualified, with better skills.\" </p> <p>The new \"Use your head - teach\" TV campaign will be broadcast for the first time next Monday, launching a \u00a312.2m push created by the ad agency DDB. Though the slogan is the same as the last campaign, the controversial \"headless chicken\" ads launched last year have gone. The focus now is on children and on the things that make teaching a different kind of job. Against a background of bright, motivated children in well-equipped classrooms, the voiceover asks its audience if they would like to \"work with the most exciting people in the world\". </p> <p>Simon Veksner, co-creator of the campaign at DDB, says: \"We are targeting people who might be slightly bored in their jobs by reminding them that teenagers are fun, spontaneous and stimulating. That could tip the balance with someone who has always thought about being a teacher and now finds themselves in some boring job. The emotional rewards and the sheer interest and stimulation that they could get from working with teenagers could get them to apply.\" </p> <p>The campaign emphasises the differ ence between teaching and other jobs. Another one asks: \"Do you ever have discussions with people who haven't made their minds up yet?\" </p> <p>The ads illustrate a change of tack by the TTA. In the 90s, teacher recruitment ads featured John Cleese and a pantheon of other celebrities who offered the name of a teacher who had inspired them. Tony Blair named Eric Anderson, his housemaster at Fettes. </p> <p>This campaign was popular in schools, focusing on the message that teaching was a worthwhile career, that teachers made a difference to people's lives. But the \"No one forgets a good teacher\" ads coincided with the TTA's worst recruitment figures. Worthy didn't work. </p> <p>\"We realised we needed to advertise to attract people,\" recalls Tabberer. \"Would-be recruits thought they would lose money, because of the extra year's study, or because of pay. People were put off by perceptions about what schools are like.\" </p> <p>Beginning with the \"Those who can _\" adverts, the TTA has moved to emphasise pragmatic reasons for doing the job. It's about training salaries, golden hellos and the fact that teachers do a job where they work with young people and also use subject knowledge from their university degree courses. </p> <p>It also reflects a changing recruitment picture. Far from being dominated by idealistic, wet-behind-the-ears graduates, new recruits to teachers are increasingly older. In 1998, less than 47% of recruits were over 25 and one in four were over 30. The most recent available figures, for 2002-3, show that 56% of recruits were 25 or over and one in three was 30 or over. \"As a second career choice we must be one of the top choices in the economy,\" says Tabberer. </p> <p>The turning point came in 2001, when numbers of trainee teachers jumped for the first time. There have been year-on-year increases ever since. Even in London, with difficult schools and high living costs, there are signs that the recruitment crisis could be past its worst. Westminster city council reported in July that teacher turnover was down for the third year running. For newly qualified teachers the figure had almost halved, with more people sticking with their schools. </p> <p>Most observers cite the introduction of the \u00a36,000 training bursary as the real reason for the increase, but Tabberer begs to differ. He points to the other major changes that were introduced at the same time. There are now over a dozen different entry routes into teaching, and Tabberer believes that the introduction of the graduate teacher programme (GTP) has been at least as influential as bursaries. </p> <p>GTP students usually have previous experience in an education or training environment and are employed in schools on a salary, usually around \u00a313,000. They train as they teach. From just 89 placements in 1997, the route has been hugely expanded. More than 5,000 GTP students started training last year. \"We made a very smart decision to go after career changers. If we had just done the bursaries, it would not have had the same impact,\" says Tabberer. </p> <p>Alan Smithers, professor of education at Buckingham University, says the government could do even more. \"The way forward is to develop the school-based route. The government is a bit reluctant to do this because it's expensive. There are lots of people who want to think about teaching later in life and the natural way for them is to take a job in school and receive a salary while training.\" </p> <p>But Ted Wragg, emeritus professor of education at Exeter university and Guardian columnist, is concerned about the move towards more school- based training, whether by the GTP route or through Scitt (school-based initial teacher training), where a consortia of schools link with a higher education institution to run the course. </p> <p>\"One or two of these have done well, but others have disappointed,\" he says. \"It's not what schools ought to be doing.\" He points out that university departments can look for the brightest academics in their field and offer students the benefit of their expertise. Busy teachers cannot compete with that depth of provision, and shouldn't be expected to, he says. </p> <p>All trainees spend time in schools, which are paid a fee for the support they give to the student teacher. The student teacher should be paired with a mentor and allowed time and space to prepare lessons and work on their course portfolio. GTP students, who are employed full-time by their schools, are also supposed to have enough free time to complete their studies. </p> <p>Research I have conducted, due to be published in a book next year, will reveal that a significant minority of schools are failing to offer the support they have contracted to provide. A quarter of the students going into schools for the first time were offered no induction programme. Some students were not allocated a mentor, and others had been used to cover for absent staff. </p> <p>\"It was extremely hard to gain any information on the school,\" said a 24-year-old languages teacher at a Midlands school. Another student believed the school had overloaded itself with trainees. \"We are viewed as an additional source of income and manpower which the school can gain in exchange for providing a bare minimum of training,\" he said. </p> <p>My survey found GTP students being asked to teach from the first week of their course, in contrast with students following the conventional route, who would normally spend several weeks observing experienced teachers before being asked to take a class. </p> <p>Teacher unions are concerned that student teachers are being used to cover for absent staff at their placement schools, a practice that is now legal under changes to the teachers' contract made last year. </p> <p>Chris Keates, acting general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, has raised these issues with the TTA. \"The issue is how they maintain quality control over the courses they contract out,\" she says. </p> <p>Tabberer's agency hasn't solved all the problems, by any means. Teaching faces a demographic time bomb in the next 20 years, as a largely middle-aged profession nears retirement. There are also problems caused by high drop-out rates: an estimated 40% of teachers leave the job three to five years after training. \"You're training about twice the number of teachers you actually need through the teacher training process,\" says Smithers. </p> <p>\"On secondary teaching the jury is still out and we are very short of good teachers in a numbers of fields: maths, modern languages, physics, chemistry.\" New figures from the graduate teacher training registry show a drop in applications for PGCE courses in languages, although overall PGCE courses for secondary schools have increased. </p> <p>In some areas of the country and some types of teaching - particularly at primary level - there has never been much shortage of teachers, and the TTA's success in attracting candidates has created problems for people who have spent a year training only to find that they cannot get a job. Earlier this summer one northern college hosted a leaving event for newly qualified teachers, during which a rough count revealed that fewer than one in five had a teaching post to go to this term. </p> <p>The imbalances between supply and demand come substantially from the way that training places are distributed. Demand is highest in the south and south-east. But the TTA funds thousands of places in the north-west and in Yorkshire. Students at Lancaster St Martin's, Manchester Metropolitan and Leeds universities all face real competition once they qualify. </p> <p>Tabberer is unmoved. \"Our prime role is to improve teaching quality,\" he says. \"We are clear that schools want a lot of choice about who they take on. So we see value in making sure that there is a very good supply. When we recruit people into teaching we are trying to make sure that they have a job, but I don't think, in a modern economy, it's a bad thing to say to people, 'You haven't got a guarantee of a job, competition will be stiff, you may have to look around for a bit'.\" </p> <p>The anomaly over the distribution of training places is just one of the many things that Tabberer inherited when he took over the TTA four years ago. That legacy included a hugely prescriptive approach to teacher training and a poisonous relationship with the higher education institutions that provide most of the training places. The TTA was created by the Conservatives in 1994, against a background of hostility to the teaching profession. The original board included Anthony O'Hear, then professor of philosophy at Bradford University, and Caroline Cox, chancellor of Bournemouth University. Both were hostile to conventional teacher training. The Universities Council for the Education of Teachers (Ucet) was offered no places on the board. This was the era of \"name and shame\", a time when Chris Woodhead, as Ofsted's chief inspector, was lamenting the existence of 15,000 \"incompetent\" teachers in the nation's schools. </p> <p>Anthea Millett, the agency's first chief executive, and previously Woodhead's second in command at Ofsted, said at the time that her first target was to raise the quality of entrants to teacher training. TTA officers were seen as high-handed, arrogant and dictatorial. Ted Wragg once described the 851 competencies set out in the first training standards as \"ridiculously excessive - 850 too many\". Though these competencies have since been whittled down, Wragg says inspectors are still looking out for them when they assess the training institutions. </p> <p>\"What they should have done was set out half a dozen generic competences,\" he says now. \"Those first few years of prescription set in stone what the agency is now trying to shake off. Ralph Tabberer has tried to do a lot and some of the recent senior appointments are very good, but they inherited an agency that was the tool of government.\" </p> <p>Four years ago, when the then schools minister Estelle Morris briefed Tabberer about his new role, she told him that the thing she regretted most was that the government had been ambivalent about the contribution of higher education to teacher training, and that she wanted that contribution to be recognised and supported. </p> <p>\"That set the tone for me: it was very much about working with people, not about picking fights,\" says Tabberer. \"Ten years on, I don't know anywhere in the world where you can point to the same trajectory of year-on-year improvement.\" </p> <p> <strong> Ted Wragg, page 5</strong></p> <p><strong>Alan Smithers profile, page 20</strong></p>",
  "The three men stood hunched beneath a bus shelter in the pouring rain as the road became a logjam of funeral processions. Giorgi, Aslan and Oleg, all in their late teens, knew some of the dead being wheeled past them to their graves. <p>As the sheer scale of the loss inflicted on Beslan became apparent, their anger began to find its focus: the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia, which was locked in a bloody war with their region, North Ossetia, 13 years ago. </p> <p>Some of the 32 militants who carried out the school attack were Ingush, investigators have said. </p> <p>Aslan said: \"Of course there will be revenge. People have to take their revenge - it's their right.\" </p> <p>His two friends nodded in agreement, as if accepting further bloodshed as an inevitable part of mourning for the dead. In the North Caucasus blood feuds in which relatives kill their loved one's murderer are common. </p> <p>Yet Aslan said any revenge attacks would probably not be targeted at specific relatives of the militants. \"It will probably be just attacks against normal Ingush people. The Ingush have already all left the [nearby] Prigorodny region. They are moving out. </p> <p>\"I won't do anything on my own - that'd be pointless. But if my people get into a war, I shall fight.\" Again, his two friends nodded at another inevitability. </p> <p>A hundred metres down the road, dozens of families brought yet more dead to the hastily dug graves in a procession of vans and cars. The air was filled with the smells of decaying flesh, cow dung and diesel fuel, as women wailed. The rain poured down endlessly, turning the field into a swamp. </p> <p>At 2pm the town's menfolk were summoned to a meeting. It was originally intended to focus their minds on what further action to take, one local official said. </p> <p>Yet two Kremlin officials arrived in expensive SUVs to speak to the crowd from a public address system. </p> <p>On one side were Russia's rich and connected, and on the other were Russia's poor, the parents, stumbling through the mud to bury their children in cheap coffins. Two pro-Putin politicians, Boris Gryzlov, the speaker of parliament, and Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, stood on platforms, addressing the crowd. Their words seemed distant and inappropriate. </p> <p>Mr Gryzlov said: \"We are at war with terrorism, and, sadly, in that war there are victims. I agree with our president, Putin, who said we must strengthen law enforcement and work to make the country more secure.\" </p> <p>Mayor Luzhkov said: \"People of Beslan, we [the people of Moscow] share your pain [after the Dubrovka theatre siege two years ago]. Do not let this turn into an internal conflict. We must work together.\" </p> <p>The appeal for unity persuaded few of those present. Across town rumours began to fly that the security services were giving people injections to make them forget the siege. Another said a group of North Ossetian men had already kidnapped 10 Ingush men. </p> <p>Aslan, 37, a local official said: \"Something scary is bound to happen. The last war between the Ingush and the North Ossetians started with the death of a taxi driver.\" </p> <p>He said popular discontent with the North Ossetian government was growing. \"Some men tried to come from the village of Sunzhe and tried to get into Vladikavkaz to take over the government building. They were not let inside the town.\" </p> <p>His mother, Irina, said: \"Our president is 70 years old, nearly at the end of his life, but he took no risks. What the hell has Putin said thank you to him for?\" </p> <p>He points to the police on the street whom many blame for the poor handling of the siege. \"See how they stand together in groups. It's because they know ordinary people would beat them up if they get them alone.\"</p>",
  "The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, last night refused to order a public inquiry into how the Beslan school was captured by gunmen and then ended with such a high death toll, and told the Guardian that people who call for talks with Chechen leaders have no conscience. <p>\"Why don't you meet Osama bin Laden, invite him to Brussels or to the White House and engage in talks, ask him what he wants and give it to him so he leaves you in peace? Why don't you do that?\" he said with searing sarcasm. </p> <p>\"You find it possible to set some limitations in your dealings with these bastards, so why should we talk to people who are childkillers? </p> <p>\"No one has a moral right to tell us to talk to childkillers,\" he added. </p> <p>\"Correct me if I'm wrong, but Margaret Thatcher, whom I've met more than once said: 'A man who comes out into the street to kill other people must himself be killed',\" he told the Guardian. </p> <p>At times grim-faced, but always calm, Mr Putin's comments came in the midst of an extraordinary three-and-a-half-hour meeting with a group of foreign journalists and academics with long experience of Russia, invited for a special conference. </p> <p>Held in his country house outside Moscow, the question-and-answer session ended after midnight. It was his first meeting with foreigners since the Beslan catastrophe. </p> <p>He said he would hold an internal inquiry into the Beslan tragedy, but not a public one. \"I want to establish the chronicle of events and find out who is responsible and might be punished,\" he said. </p> <p>If the Russian parliament wanted to set up its own inquiry, he would not object, but he warned that it could become \"a political show\". </p> <p>\"If that happened, it would not be very productive,\" he said. </p> <p>The long discussion covered a wide range of topics but returned to the issue of Chechnya more than once. </p> <p>Russian officials believe Shamil Basayev, the most extreme Chechen commander, was responsible for the hostage-taking, which ended with at least 335 dead, hundreds injured and scores missing. </p> <p>Witnesses have reported that the hostage-takers had attempted to justify their brutality by claiming it as an act of revenge for the killing by Russian forces of Chechen children. </p> <p>Mr Putin's words yesterday followed the unending stream of funerals as the people of Beslan buried their children, relatives and friends, while others sought information on those still missing. </p> <p>The president admitted Russian forces had committed human rights violations in Chechnya but, like the torture by US soldiers in the prison of Abu Ghraib in Iraq, these were not sanctioned from the top, he said. </p> <p>\"In war there are ugly processes which have their own logic,\" he said. </p> <p>Striking the table with the side of his right hand, he said there was no connection between Russian policies in Chechnya and the events in Beslan. </p> <p>\"Just imagine that people who shoot children in the back came to power anywhere on our planet. Just ask yourself that, and you will have no more questions about our policy in Chechnya,\" he said. </p> <p>The president made it clear he sees the drive for Chechen independence as the spearhead of a strategy by Chechen Islamists, helped by foreign fundamentalists, to undermine the whole of southern Russia and even stir up trouble among Muslim communities in other parts of the country. </p> <p>\"There are Muslims along the Volga, in Tatarstan and Bashkortostan. Chechnya isn't Iraq. It's not far away. It's a vital part of our territory. This is all about Russia's territorial integrity,\" he said. </p> <p>Russia was interested in a political solution in Chechnya, he insisted. It was going to hold elections to a Chechen parliament there shortly \"and we will try to attract as many people as possible with different views to take part\". </p> <p>\"We will strengthen law enforcement by staffing the police with Chechens, and gradually withdraw our troops to barracks, and leave as small a contingent as we feel necessary, just like the US does in California and Texas,\" he said. </p> <p>He could not agree that a war was still going on there five years after he first sent in troops. \"It is a smouldering conflict. There have been attacks but not like the big operations of 1999,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>There was a time when you'd go to work for a company and be automatically put in its final salary (also called defined benefit) pension scheme. This gave you a pension based on a percentage of your salary at retirement, aiming for two-thirds. Provided the employer didn't go bust, your pension was guaranteed, the employer took all the risk, and you had a decent retirement, free to lounge around sipping G&amp;Ts.</p> <p>Things are no longer so easy. Aside from the public services, most companies that offer a pension have switched to 'money purchase' (also called defined contribution) arrangements. Here your pension level is not guaranteed. The growth of your pension pot is based on how much is contributed plus how well the stock market performs, and you shoulder the risk - if your pension doesn't do well, you lose out, your employer doesn't.</p> <p>When you do retire, you will have to use that pot to buy an annuity - a plan that provides an income for life - from an insurance company by the age of 75. </p> <p>These are not cheap. If you want a yearly retirement income of say, \u00a320,000, a basic annuity will cost you around \u00a3300,000. If you want your income to increase with inflation then it's even more expensive - over \u00a3400,000.</p> <p>If it's all so costly, why not just rely on the state pension to pay for your retirement? After all, you've worked hard and paid taxes all your life. Well, the state pension, along with the second state pension, which is linked to earnings, and your national insurance record, will give the average earner about \u00a36,000 a year, and that is expected to decrease in future. Probably not enough to keep you in the manner to which you have become accustomed.</p> <p>A pension is not the only way to save for retirement of course, but its tax breaks - you get income tax relief on your contributions up to the highest rate of tax you pay - make it appealing for many. </p> <p>There are plenty of headlines screaming about a national pensions crisis. If you want to avoid your own personal crisis, you can either hope for a long lost aunt to leave you a big inheritance, or you can plan the amount you contribute, the investment risk you want to take, and when you plan to retire. The later you begin, the harder it will be to build up enough money for your future.</p> <p><strong>Retirement? I'm in my 20s</strong> </p> <p>With retirement so far off, and, for most people, plenty of debts to be paid off, saving for your old age in your 20s might seem laughable. </p> <p>Indeed, at this stage, clearing debts should be a priority. \"There's no point in saving and getting a lower rate of interest than you are paying out on your debts,\" says Dryden Gilling-Smith, of EBS Management, which sets up and administers personal pensions.</p> <p>However, if your company offers a pension scheme, and contributes into it, you should probably join. Your employer will often start off contributing around 3% of your pre-tax salary, with you expected to contribute at least 3% as well - and you get tax relief at the highest rate of tax you pay, so 22% for standard rate taxpayers or 40% for higher rate. </p> <p>If you don't join the scheme, you're effectively throwing money away: both your employer's contribution and that government tax relief, which is the main bonus of saving through a pension. </p> <p>As a general rule of thumb, at this point you should really be looking to save at least 10% of your earnings. Roger Cobley, president of the Pensions Management Institute, offers this guide: \"If you halve the age when you start saving, that's about the percentage of your salary you should be considering.\" So 20 years old equals 10%, 30 equals 15%, and so on.</p> <p>You will be given a choice of different investment options with different levels of risk. Generally speaking, since retirement is a long way off you can afford to go for the higher risk options, with most of your pension fund being invested in stocks, still considered the highest earning assets over the long term. </p> <p>If you don't have access to a company pension, and your debts are under control, you might want to consider a stakeholder pension. The government introduced these in 2001, as a cheap personal pension option. You won't pay more than 1% of your fund on annual charges and if you change jobs you can take it with you. There are a host of other personal pensions as well, and you may want to get professional advice to determine what is best for you.</p> <p>All in all remember, the earlier you get saving the better off you will be in the future. As it stands, if you're now 22, earning \u00a320,000 and 6% is going into a pension, you're on course for \u00a39,820 a year after 65. Will that be enough? </p> <p><strong>The big three uh-oh</strong></p> <p>Once you reach your 30s, it's time to re-evaluate. How much have you saved? Indeed, have you saved anything at all? Do you need to boost your level of contribution to attain your desired income? Do you have other commitments, a mortgage, or children, that have reduced the amount you can save?</p> <p>\"As a very rough estimate, you should have at least 25% of your required provision in place,\" says Philip Platts, managing director of financial planning company EFG Platts Flello. So if we're talking about a retirement income of \u00a320,000, that's \u00a375,000 saved so far. If you've only managed to build up a pot of, say, \u00a310,000 by the age of 35, you would need to save about \u00a3900 a month to achieve that level.</p> <p>If have an occupational pension, earn less than \u00a330,000 and need to increase the amount you are saving, you can open a stakeholder and make extra contributions that way. If you earn more than \u00a330,000, and you are in an occupational scheme, then a stakeholder is out of the question. In that case, two of your main options are Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs), a pension top-up facility that allows you to make extra contributions to a scheme run by your employer, and free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs). This is a similar top-up vehicle, but this time it is separate from your employer's scheme.</p> <p>However, the charges attached to these ways of saving are relatively high, and it's debatable whether you would be better off, financially, to wait until the rules are simplified in 2006. </p> <p>When the changes come in, many of the complicated rules surrounding pensions will be simplified. Mike Morrison, pensions strategy manager at life company Winterthur, says: \"After 2006 we'll have something called 'full concurrency' which means you can have as many pension plans as you like.\" </p> <p>This means that, assuming you're employed, you can take out an additional stakeholder and contribute as much as you like into it, up to your current salary. You might want to speak to an independent financial adviser (IFA) to figure out the best way to do this.</p> <p>There are, of course, plenty of other investment options open to you. You could opt for individual savings accounts, or choose to invest in property. Again, it's best to speak to an IFA before you make any big decisions.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Starting later? <a href=\"http://money.theguardian.com/savingforretirement/story/0,11410,1304317,00.html\"> Saving in your 40s, 50s and through to retirement</a></p>",
  "Cherie Booth could always become involved with football - maybe take on the steerage of the England team, in a manager/coach capacity. Short of that, it's difficult to see how she could be less popular, across an amazingly broad spectrum of the nation's chattering, political and, indeed, voting classes. If there's one arena in which she enjoys a reasonable amount of affection, it's among lawyers. And we all know what we think of them. <p>Recent attacks have centred on her decision to keep the royalties from her forthcoming book, The Goldfish Bowl. It's about prime ministers' wives. I suppose the argument for her giving the money to charity would be that her unique insights into this particular topic are due to her husband's efforts and not her own, but I think that's pretty weak. She still has to write the darn thing. </p> <p>More probably, her critics are listening to their guts over their minds, and their guts are saying: \"Love, you have tons of money! Give some of it away!\" Even the most intermittent follower of Cherie's first-lady trajectory will know that this is like asking a tiger to go easy on the stripes. She does not like to give away money, not even in the cash/services exchange that most of us would know as \"spending\". </p> <p>My objection to the book comes from the title, by which I intend to judge it, pending a look at the cover. The clear signal is that this is about scrutiny, principally media scrutiny, and how unjust it all is. Sources \"close to\" Ms Booth talk continually of how wounding she finds it when people attack her for her outfits, her dodgy property deals, or her free holidays. </p> <p>I wouldn't even defend it on the basis that this is the price you pay for life in the public eye. I would merely say, good Christ, it's the Daily Mail you're talking about most of the time. Your average 18-year-old fresh out of Pop Idol gets more kneejerk flak, more personal intrusion, more judgment for their physical frame and decoration thereof than a prime minister's wife will take in a lifetime. What do they do? They ignore it! Sticks and stones may break their bones, but accusations of cellulite will never hurt them. If The Goldfish Bowl hinges on the iniquities of the press, as I suspect it will, all I can say is, toughen up a little. Take a tip from Jordan. Get over yourself. </p> <p>But it remains the case that Cherie is like a political pi\u00f1ata for many of us, this figure of gaudy hate that we're all going to hit with as many sticks as we can think of, until she explodes in a plume of sweets and tissue paper. And for the sake of our own souls, rather than hers, we need to decide what constitutes a legitimate target.</p> <p>The tightness is legitimate - she is legendarily stingy, this woman. Not just the free holidays, the grabby shopping trips, the Downing Street expenses skirmishes. This is a woman who, at the last Labour conference, walked off with a trades union mug she hadn't paid for, on the basis that she \"never carries cash\". She's an absolute skinflint. And the long-term impact of all this is that we have to suffer entire summers of this family chummying up to Berlusconi, just because they won't cough for their own villa. Clearly, Blair is also to blame, but that doesn't expiate Cherie, nor make the spectacle any less demoralising. </p> <p> The clothing, the new-age healing, the lipstick-on-the-coverlet portrait - all that, unless it intersects with Peter Foster or some incidental ligging, is irrelevant. I think she probably is quite a vain woman, but it doesn't matter that much. There's often sly criticism for the fact that she works too hard, or doesn't work hard enough, or thinks of herself as a superwoman, without being sufficiently super. That's all so much nonsense: while I recognise that people still exist who resent women for working and having a family at the same time, it baffles me that they're not too embarrassed to say so. </p> <p>She is occasionally hit by the dust of battened-down snobbery. Mary Ann Sieghart wrote of Booth in the Times yesterday: \"In conversation, she is lively company. She speaks quickly and fluently, with just the occasional vowel betraying her Liverpudlian roots.\" Astonishing, the messages in that sentence - that provincial roots are shaming; that speed and fluency might be impaired by a provincial accent; and, I think, a background hum of \"what's a common upstart like that doing in a seat of power in the first place?\" You often hear that subtext in attacks on Booth; it really is obnoxious. </p> <p>So, while I wouldn't for a second advocate a ceasefire in Cherie-sniping, I think, as we approach the publication of her book, when the fun will really start, it's time to sort out fair criticism from extraneous malice. When we give free rein to any piece of unpleasantness that pops into our heads, it's not really a critique of Booth at all. It's a critique of everyone but. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:zoe_williams @ntlworld.com\">zoe_williams@ntlworld.com</a></p>",
  "<p>John Tiner, chief executive of the Financial Services Authority, yesterday expressed his frustration over an appeal being brought by Legal &amp; General against a fine for endowment mis-selling. </p> <p>Breaking the FSA's silence over the appeal which begins next week, Mr Tiner said the decision by L&amp;G to take its case to the financial services and markets appeal tribunal should not be held up as an example of a financial firm having the confidence to take on the FSA. </p> <p>L&amp;G is the first big firm to challenge a decision by the FSA at the tribunal. Royal &amp; SunAlliance, Scottish Amicable and Abbey Life have all accepted the FSA's findings on similar cases. </p> <p>At an FSA conference on enforcement yesterday, Mr Tiner did not cite L&amp;G by name but mentioned \"one firm investigated for endowment misselling\" which had referred its case to the tribunal. </p> <p>\"I think it will be a mistake to give that particular referral a symbolic importance that I do not believe it has. It is not a case of one firm standing up to the regulator on behalf of other firms. Those other firms are well able to look after themselves,\" Mr Tiner said. </p> <p>\"In all but one of the enforcement cases for endowment mis-selling, the company involved accepted that they had been mis-selling, accepted that there were systems control failings and got on with the business of complaint handling and compensation. </p> <p>\"But the firms did not simply give in or surrender under pressure. The senior management of those firms will understand their responsibilities and their need to act in the best interests of their shareholders and their members,\" Mr Tiner said. </p> <p>David Prosser, chief executive of Legal &amp; General, said yesterday: \"I would prefer not be in this position ... but we are were are.\" He was speaking as he launched the Financial Services Skills Council, an organisation set up to promote training for the 1.3 million people working in the financial services industry. Mr Prosser is chairing the FSSC, which is taking over from the FSA responsibility for setting qualification standards. </p> <p>Meanwhile, an appeal tribunal is due to begin rehearing the case of entrepreneur Paul Davidson later this month. His first appeal against a \u00a3750,000 fine for market abuse was halted after questions were asked about the impartiality of the hearing. Mr Tiner said the FSA was \"disappointed\" that the original tribunal had to be stopped.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is moving towards the abolition of the traditional weekend, according to an employment survey, which suggests that only one in five workers get a genuinely free Saturday and Sunday. </p> <p>Children with homework are finding their catch-up grind shared by parents who have failed to finish work on time, or else are chasing promotion or extra money from overtime. </p> <p>The change in lifestyle, encouraged by reforms which have blurred weekend boundaries, particularly Sunday opening of shops and businesses, was reported by more than 800 of 1,000 employees questioned. </p> <p>Many took work home with them to finish off, instead of joining family outings. Others went back into offices or factories to work extra shifts, including staying late on both Saturday and Sunday nights. </p> <p>The trend is alarming, according to the survey's organisers Payroll Portfolio, a London employment agency, and the employment law specialist Peninsula, which is based in Manchester. </p> <p>Initial increases in productivity from the sheer amount of time worked are likely to be lost through stress, the firms say. </p> <p>Danny Done, managing director of Portfolio, said that the spread of work across the full seven days of a week threatened a healthy work/life balance. The two firms recently surveyed a possibly related downside for employers - the number of workers lying about being sick to get a day off. Exactly the same proportion as the weekend workers, four fifths, of 927 employees questioned admitted the ploy. </p> <p>Mr Done said: \"Carefully monitoring people's workload and work duties would help to prevent the practice in the first place, as well as easing stress.\"</p>",
  "<p>The normally loquacious Warwickshire vice-captain Dougie Brown did not utter a word as his county won their third championship title in a decade yesterday - he was sitting in a dentist's chair at the time. It was a position that also inhibited the quaffing of inordinate amounts of bubbly, something he says will be rectified tomorrow night. </p> <p>\"I watched every ball of the Sussex-Middlesex match on the internet until near the end when I had to go off and have my teeth seen to,\" he said. \"I'm sure all the lads were following the game, whatever ports they were in. We're getting together at the ground for a fitness check tomorrow morning and we're having a dinner at Edgbaston on Wednesday to mark the 10th anniversary of our 1994 title. So now it can be a double celebration.\" </p> <p>Brown, a member of the side that lifted the trophy in 1994 and 1995, says it is now time people gave Warwickshire credit, even though they have won only five matches, a record low for the championship since it was split into two divisions for the 2000 season. Warwickshire have one game remaining, in Northampton next week. </p> <p>\"We've had a lot of flak from a lot of people and it's very unjust,\" he said. \"But those people have ended up with egg on their faces. Physically and mentally it's been a long and demanding season, but we've got there and deserved our success. </p> <p>\"And we've done it with Nick Knight in his first season as captain and John Inverarity in only his second. Nick's been the hands-on one, with John having the quiet words. But even though John's quiet he's an Aussie and you can feel his spirit and desire pushing through. He's made us remember the basics.\" </p> <p>The Warwickshire of 1994 had the most remarkable season in county cricket history, winning three trophies and finishing runners-up in the fourth. But despite the limitations of the current side, Brown says it has much in common with that of a decade ago. </p> <p>\"We have won by batting extremely well, getting big scores quickly, thanks to Nick Knight, Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott. We don't have any superstar bowlers but those we do have have been given plenty of time to wheel and chip away. It was very similar in 1994 when Brian Lara, Dominic Ostler and Roger Twose piled up the runs. It was different in 1995 when we had Allan Donald to blast away.\" </p> <p>Warwickshire have more batting points and - surprisingly - more bowling points than any other side in the First Division. Remarkably, for it flies in the face of history, they have won the title without a meaningful contribution from the spin department. </p> <p>England's Ashley Giles played only one match, taking four for 128 in the victory over Surrey. The all-rounder Brad Hogg couldn't buy a wicket at the start of the season and when he left Edgbaston he had taken only 14 at 62 in 11 games. When Sussex took the title last year Mushtaq Ahmed claimed 103 wickets. \"We haven't been able to play Ashley because he's been with England, and the pitches have been too slow for Brad,\" added Brown. </p> <p>It has also been a difficult season for the faster bowlers. In Warwickshire's last match, in Worcester, Brown became the first bowler to reach 30 wickets and only the second to take five wickets in an innings (following Heath Streak, who did it twice). </p> <p>Another feature of Warwickshire's success has been their ability to pick up four points for a draw when they have been outplayed; they have won only one game since mid-June. \"There's more than one way to win the championship,\" said Brown, \"and we've shown amazing character when we've been outplayed a few times, with Numbers 8, 9, 10 and 11 batting really well.\" </p> <p>Ultimately, their success will go down as a triumph for professionalism in the absence of brilliance. It was also won in the absence of a sustained challenge from Surrey or Lancashire, the strongest clubs in recent years; and Sussex made a poor start to their defence. </p> <p>In a non-vintage year, Warwickshire won the championship because they were the most difficult team to beat and they also had the good fortune to win the toss on 12 out of 15 occasions. </p> <p><strong>Three key results</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 May 12-15, Edgbaston Beat Surrey by seven wickets</strong> </p> <p>Surrey were cruising to a draw at 364 for two when Neil Carter, Dewald Pretorius and Dougie Brown took the last eight wickets for 50 runs. They then made 171 in under 33 overs and their season was up and running. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 May 25-28, Edgbaston Beat Worcs by nine wickets</strong> </p> <p>Went top after skittling the visitors for 185 in the second innings then, led by 83 from their captain Nick Knight, knocked off the runs with ease. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 August 24-27, Edgbaston Drew with Sussex</strong> </p> <p>At 132 for seven on the final afternoon Warwickshire were struggling until Heath Streak and Tony Frost thwarted Sussex for over an hour and a half.</p>",
  "<p>There were 13 left in at yesterday's five-day declaration stage for the St Leger at Doncaster, but that number could be reduced to single figures by Saturday. With a dry week forecast, Rule Of Law has leap-frogged over Quiff as market leader, Ladbrokes going 9-4 about the Godolphin colt with Quiff pushed out to 11-4. </p> <p>No rain could mean real pain for the backers of Quiff. Sir Michael Stoute's filly proved most effective in the mud at York last month when romping home by 11 lengths in the Yorkshire Oaks, but connections have warned that she could miss Doncaster if the ground rides too fast. </p> <p>Stoute, who has yet to saddle a St Leger winner, has also left in Maraahel, successful in the Amro Stakes at Goodwood, currently put in at 6-1. </p> <p>Rule Of Law is Godolphin's sole representative. The colt, who was offered at double figures for the St Leger before his impressive win over Let The Lion Roar in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York last month, pleased trainer Saeed bin Suroor in his final piece of work at Newmarket yesterday morning when ridden by his big-race partner, the Australian Kerrin McEvoy. </p> <p>Aidan O'Brien, who has had a disappointing season, will be bidding for his third win in the Classic and has left in five - Tycoon, Go For Gold, Acropolis, Mikado and Two Miles West. At 10-1, Tycoon is rated the Irish trainer's best chance by Ladbrokes. </p> <p>Percussionist, from John Gosden's stable, is in the betting at 8-1 but is not certain to run. The son of Sadler's Wells was last seen when finishing tailed off behind Grey Swallow in the Irish Derby. Percussionist had previously run fourth in the Derby at Epsom but the Sangster family-owned colt has a number of other options. </p> <p>\"We have got an open mind with him and we want to see what is in the Prix Niel at Longchamp and the Arc trial at Newbury a week on Saturday,\" said Ben Sangster. \"He's in very good form.\" </p> <p>Darsalam looks like being the first runner from the Czech Republic to run in the Doncaster showpiece. The half-brother to the 1994 St Leger winner Moonax is now with Arslangirey Shavuyev having been previously trained by Mark Johnston. Stanley Chin will have the mount. </p> <p>It could be a great day for the Godolphin team with Doyen, easy winner of the Hardwicke Stakes and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, rated a 5-4 favourite by Coral to add the Baileys Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown. </p> <p>\"Doyen is in good condition and it's all systems go for Ireland,\" said the Godolphin racing manager Simon Crisford. \"Millstreet will also be on duty as pacemaker.\" </p> <p>The Irish Derby winner Grey Swallow, next in at 9-2, will be stepping back in trip to 10 furlongs, while Azamour, winner of the St James's Palace Stakes, moves up from a mile. </p> <p>Warrsan, fresh from his weekend German Group One success in the Grosser Preis von Baden, may be allowed to take his chance for a quickfire double at Leopardstown. </p> <p>The six-year-old's trainer Clive Brittain said: \"We have left him in and it's still on [the table]. I'll look at the acceptors later on but he would certainly be a serious contender for the Arc whatever happens.\" </p> <p> <strong> St Leger betting </strong> ( Ladbrokes): 9-4 Rule Of Law, 11-4 Quiff, 6-1 Let The Lion Roar, Maraahel, 8-1 Percussionist, 10-1 Tycoon, 14-1 Go For Gold, 16-1 Frank Sonata, Two Miles West, 25-1 Mikado, 33-1 Albinus, 50-1 Acropolis, 66-1 Darsalam.</p>",
  "<p>Relishing his status as the first England bowler to take 200 one-day wickets, Darren Gough was his old ebullient self yesterday. Not even the aftermath of a few late-night beers with Freddie Flintoff - a Flintoff in angsty mood, awaiting an update on the birth of his first baby - could dampen his assault upon those who have dared to talk of his retirement. </p> <p>Gough bristled like he did in his heyday, before his knee decided to taunt him with a passable impression of a hot-air balloon, scoffing at suggestions that an England victory in the Champions Trophy this month might provide a neat finale to a glorious international career. </p> <p>Holly Flintoff was born at 3.52am yesterday, four weeks premature. According to Gough, talk of his last delivery may be about four years premature. That 200th wicket - India's Harbhajan Singh caught at backward point at Lord's on Sunday - has him bursting with pride. He is even enamoured with the speed gun again. \"It's coming out at 88mph - not bad for a medium-pacer.\" </p> <p>He has not abandoned dreams of playing in the 2007 World Cup, but his pride would be stirred most of all by an Ashes win next summer. He might have retired from Test cricket but Essex would have to give him time off to go and watch. \"If we beat Australia I will be cheering them on. I will be there the day that they do it and it will be my proudest moment ever.\" He may well lead the Barmy Army singsong. </p> <p>He can catalogue past one-day disasters. 1996 World Cup: \"bad selection.\" 1999 World Cup: \"We had a good chance in England, but we lacked bottle.\" 2003 World Cup: \"A mess - we would have qualified if we had played Zimbabwe.\" </p> <p>That leaves him flabbergasted at England's sated response to the Champions Trophy. \"The best players in the world are here for two weeks. It's second to the World Cup. You want to measure yourself against the best. To win it would be brilliant.\" </p> <p>Injury has caused Gough to miss nearly a quarter of England's 173 one-day internationals since his debut. These days, when he leaves a cricket field in sound working order it is a minor miracle. He barely bowls in the nets, he no longer risks treadmills, and every month he visits his German specialist, Dr Hans M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt, for injections aimed at regenerating his cartilage. </p> <p>Pride persistently refuels Gough when others would opt for a strategic withdrawal. Retirement will not come naturally, involving a good deal of readjustment for a player who has loved the limelight. </p> <p>\"It takes time to come back from career-threatening injuries, but I'm the first Englishman to take 200 wickets and I'm proud of that. I have heard people saying that the Champions Trophy might be my natural end, but it is not the media's decision on when I have to retire; it is my decision, the selectors' and the captain's. </p> <p>\"Only in England would people write that. I don't see people writing that Glenn McGrath should retire.\" In Australia they did, actually, but there was not much chance for interjections. </p> <p>\"I'm not saying I'll be at the World Cup, but I think I deserve the opportunity to try. If I can keep my fitness up, who knows? I love proving people wrong, and there are a few wrong people out there. </p> <p>\"Leaving Yorkshire was the hardest decision of my life; I still check their scores first on Teletext. But my move to Essex has been brilliant for me. They understand my needs. They don't overuse me in the nets.\" </p> <p>Gough's ability to bowl not only with the new ball but also at the death remains his greatest asset. \"You need four death bowlers,\" he asserted. \"Not two, four.\" As England's one-day side has rarely had two bowlers who relish the closing overs, four would probably secure his involvement for ever. </p> <p>He was still bubbling as he got into a taxi with two younger England team-mates, James Anderson and Geraint Jones, asking if his trendy new glasses made him look younger. When told he should borrow Anderson's shades, he fulminated: \"I've tried his, they're useless.\" </p> <p>There had been only one way to interrupt Gough. No England player relishes being asked if he intends to tour Zimbabwe for the one-day series this winter. Talk about an ardour-dampener. \"I haven't made a decision on Zimbabwe,\" he said. \"I don't think anyone has. That's personal at the moment.\" There followed such a pregnant silence that deafness might have descended upon the world.</p>",
  "Conventional wisdom has it that elections are won or lost in the TV studios or through the pages of the national press and that, as a result, there is no longer the need for an army of party members to be available to spread the message at the school gates, in the workplace or on the doorsteps. <p>This view is challenged by new research from Lancaster University. An analysis of local activity in the past three general elections showed that in those constituencies where there was a strong local campaign people were more likely to vote, and that the harder individual parties campaigned the more likely people were to vote for that party. </p> <p>The loss of an activist base makes it much more difficult to boost turnout among your own supporters. Labour needs to be aware that direct mail is not as effective as knocking on doors on polling day. </p> <p>There is also the attitude in some quarters that party members are really a bit of a pain. They can be critical of the leadership at the most inconvenient times; they want to hold ministers and individual MPs to account and be involved in determining the overall direction of the party. </p> <p>Such a view of members fails to recognise that they provide the lifeblood of all political parties. Without them the party becomes a shell. So what should Labour be doing now to make sure this doesn't happen? </p> <p>By the next election the likelihood is that Labour will have been in office for more than eight years. There is a danger that it becomes part of the political establishment. We must always remind ourselves that the task of a Labour government is not simply to be a competent administration but to transform the society in which we live. </p> <p>This provides an opportunity to get party members fired up about the changes that need to be made in our country. This would galvanise existing members and have the potential to attract new recruits. But for this to happen we need to be clear about the part to be played by members and exactly what their role and powers are to be. </p> <p>They rightly expect to be listened to and involved in the process of identifying priorities and developing policies. This shouldn't cause alarm. We need to learn to trust our party members. They live in the real world, beyond the Westminster village, and want to transform for the better the communities in which they live and work. It takes political courage to be a party of reform as opposed to one of reaction. But by involving party members to a greater degree we should gain the strength and self-confidence to take on the rightwing press and political commentators rather than seek their approval. </p> <p>We cannot ignore the fact that there is a vociferous minority within the membership who have never come to terms with New Labour or with Tony Blair as leader. </p> <p>For them there will always be an attraction in taking the easy route of criticising the present and the leadership responsible for it, rather than being involved in the far more challenging task of offering a vision for the future. </p> <p>Yet these are just a minority, and concern about the negative part they will play must not hold us back from offering greater involvement to the majority who, I have no doubt, will engage in the process in a constructive and responsible manner. </p> <p>In order to demonstrate that it is possible to renew yourself as a political party while still being in office it is crucial to bring forward a well-thought-through programme that is relevant to the needs and aspirations of the British people. New ways need to be found to ensure that party members are involved in formulating policy. </p> <p>One of the weaknesses of Labour in office has been the way in which some important policies - like tuition fees and foundation hospitals - have been launched on to an unsuspecting party without sufficient prior debate. </p> <p>The process used in the Big Conversation provides a model as to how things could be done in the future. First, the problem to be tackled is identified. A full background briefing is given to put it into context. Then a range of options are given, one of which will need to be chosen. </p> <p>A similar approach could be adopted in relation to some of the difficult and potentially divisive issues that Labour will need to address. It could be used to provide answers to questions such as: what part should co-payments play in expanding public services? How do we tackle the pensions crisis? What should a detailed package of support for carers consist of? This has to be the way forward. Labour treating its members as assets to be valued and not as liabilities to be tolerated. </p> <p>For those of us who have had the privilege of sitting around the cabinet table, there is a particular responsibility in recognising the role played by individual party members in getting us there. We must act now to ensure that we have a strong, vibrant and active membership which is able to renew and revitalise the party for a third term. </p> <p>The alternative is to see the Labour party depleted through loss of members and, as a consequence, weakened as a political force.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:stephenbyersmp@parliament.uk\">Stephen Byers</a> is MP for North Tyneside and was a cabinet member from 1998-2002</p>",
  "The enmity between Gordon Brown and Alan Milburn dates back to Labour's opposition years and, according to one well-placed MP who was only half-joking yesterday, both would prefer to bury the hatchet in each other than in the ground. <p>Political differences are greatly magnified by personal animosity which could make handing Milburn a key role in an election campaign in which the chancellor, will play a prominent part, a new test of the concept of political unity. </p> <p>A tabloid newspaper proprietor maintains that Milburn, a former health secretary, once declared: \"I hate Brown\" when asked about his relationship with the Treasury supremo. </p> <p>The chancellor has never knowingly uttered a kind word about his former - and possibly future - colleague, and is said to greet the mention of his name with a dismissive harrumph.</p> <p>Milburn is an arch moderniser, an ultra-Blairite who sees himself as a rival to Brown when Tony Blair puts the Labour crown up for grabs. </p> <p>Public animosity was on display during the battle over foundation hospitals, a tussle which ended in a sort of score draw with Milburn securing the creation of new institutions but Brown ensuring they remain firmly within the NHS.</p> <p>The chancellor viewed Milburn as a would-be architect of NHS privatisation; the man lined up by Downing Street for a spectacular return to government wanting foundation hospitals to be free to borrow money on the markets and describing them as \"foundation companies\" in a draft bill.</p> <p>The former health secretary viewed Brown as a chancellor resisting reform and attempting to micro-manage hospitals from the Treasury when control should, he argued, be devolved to local managers and communities.</p> <p>Brown regarded Milburn as a No 10 \"spy\" when he was chief secretary to the Treasury from the end of 1998 until mid-1999, and the relationship between the pair was worse than when Milburn was in Brown's shadow team.</p> <p>Milburn's supporters say Brown hates their man's tendency to speak his mind and stand up for himself. Brown's camp say it's not personal but political, the chancellor rejecting Milburn's version of modernisation.</p>",
  "A former Labour law officer who opposed the Iraq war said yesterday that legally, Tony Blair would not be able to avoid a parliamentary debate calling for his impeachment. <p>Lord Murray, the former lord advocate of Scotland who served under the Wilson and Callaghan governments in the 1970s, said it was \"perfectly permissible to move an impeachment motion\". </p> <p>Downing Street has argued that the process is effectively obsolete because it has not been used for more than 154 years, since Lord Palmerston faced a motion. </p> <p>Lord Murray himself faced a call for his own impeachment in 1977. He was accused of mishandling a murder case that involved the wrongful conviction of Patrick Meehan, who received a royal pardon after a failed attempt by Lord Murray to convict another man who confessed to the crime. </p> <p>Lord Murray said yesterday: \"I remember the suggestion to impeach me, which was, of course, entirely misconceived. For an impeachment trial to go ahead in the House of Lords there had to be a vote in favour in the House of Commons.</p> <p>\"It is, nevertheless, perfectly permissible to move an impeachment motion in the Commons, and I do not think a debate can be avoided,\" he added.</p> <p>\"My view happens to be that the decision to go to war was illegal under international law, and that the reason given for going to war in the first place was insufficient to make it legal.\" </p> <p>Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, who is heading the impeachment campaign, will today table 101 questions to Mr Blair about his conduct in the handling of the war. </p> <p>These include a large number on the accuracy of intelligence reports and when Mr Blair was informed that intelligence on weapons of mass destruction had been withdrawn. </p> <p>He also wants to know why information on closing down biological warfare production volunteered by the Iraqis was not given to parliament.</p>"
