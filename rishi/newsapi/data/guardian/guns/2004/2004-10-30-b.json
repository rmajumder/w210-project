  "<p>A few years ago, when he was editing Esquire, Peter Howarth was dining in Milan with GQ editor Dylan Jones. 'He said, \"What's your escape plan?\",' Howarth recalls, '\"because someone asked me the other day and I didn't know\". So I started to think about what to do next.' </p> <p>What he did was to start a company, Show Media, a small publishing house producing an array of titles for clients ranging from Mo\u00ebt and Chandon (glossy magazine Vintage ) to the Department of Trade and Industry ( Dad magazine) as well as occasional consumer titles. </p> <p>Its latest publication, the Quarterly, is a slickly produced lifestyle magazine to be given away with the Week, the news digest founded by journalist Jolyon Connell and now owned by Dennis Publishing. It will provide the Week 's 93,000 readers with 'fluffy stuff' to complement the title's hard news agenda. The editorial synergies between the Week , with its succinct summations of world events, and the Quarterly, which will tell readers where to buy the perfect little black dress or the best wine, aren't immediately apparent. Howarth insists the Quarterly 's editorial concept - short, easily digestible pieces written by experts in their field - mirrors that of its sister title, but more of that later. </p> <p>Howarth was a stalwart of men's style journalism, editing both Arena and Esquire, but his journalistic career only began after a dalliance with the fashion industry. Like many teenagers in the punk era, he 'wanted to be a pop star' but, after failing to get into art school, he 'ended up doing English at Cambridge, the only place in the world where I could be a bit of a rough. I revelled in it'. </p> <p>When it was time to graduate, in 1986, 'all the banks came round and I didn't want to work for a bank'. So Howarth took a full-time post at Paul Smith, who had given him a summer job selling shirts in his London shop, and helped Smith to expand the business at a time when it was changing from a boutique to a major fashion label. He left to join Nicole Fahri, where he was put in charge of producing its first menswear collection, 'but all my mates who were journalists seemed to be having a better time than me'. He went to see Vogue and GQ editor Alex Shulman to ask for a job. 'I said, \"Look, I'm Tom Wolfe\". She said, \"What I need is someone who can write about trousers\".' After carving out a niche as a fashion writer, Howarth moved to Arena, then to Esquire, where he famously banned women in bikinis from the cover. The title lost 30,000 readers, and Howarth was publicly derided by his old friend Jones, who pursued the opposite policy at GQ and sneered that Howarth was 'out of touch'. 'We're friends now that we no longer compete,' Howarth says, 'but he's just signed me up as a contributing editor, so I have to say that.' </p> <p>Howarth says his decision to remove scantily clad models from Esquire 's front page was commercially motivated, although there is no disguising his contempt for the 'new lad' school of journalism, which was the dominant force for much of his time at Esquire. (He describes Zoo and Nuts, the latest innovation in the men's market, as 'toilet paper'). </p> <p>' Esquire was the 8th-best selling men's magazine in a market of 10. It was survival. It wasn't some sort of moral stand', Howarth says. The magazine was being outsold by GQ, its main rival, and advertisers were abandoning the title in droves. Howarth wanted to create a point of difference to attract a more discerning (and wealthier) readership and charge advertisers higher rates. Natmags reasoned that the magazine might lose 20,000 sales and calculated that it could make up the losses by hiking rates by 20 per cent. Sales almost halved. 'I spent the first year after the repositioning expecting to get fired every day'. The problem, of course, was the remarkable success of Emap's FHM, which was regularly selling 500,000 copies. 'They [publishers] all fell in love with FHM, Maxim, Loaded. They just sat there and went \"We need a piece of that\". So you had [former Arena owner] Nick Logan, whose brother-in-law is [former FHM editor] Mike Soutar, coming in after Sunday lunch with a copy of FHM saying \"what are we going to do about this?\" </p> <p>'You get to a point when you think what am I going to do next. I was 38, I've got three kids and I'm thinking I'm never going to make any proper money here. I'm going to hang on by my fingertips until I'm 45, and then they'll replace me with someone who's 32, and then where do I go?' </p> <p>A friend had asked him to produce a glossy supplement for Business Week and Howarth was approached by Fathers Direct, the government-backed national information centre for fatherhood. 'They wanted an \" Esquire for Dads\", and at that point I thought \"I've got two offers, so I'll do it [quit Esquire ]\".' Other projects have included a one-off surfing magazine for French Connection and the Newspaper Magazine, a fashion title whose models are Premiership footballers. ('There's an ad in the middle with Freddy Ljungberg in his Calvin Klein pants and the Arsenal team wallpapered the entire dressing room with it.') </p> <p>The idea for the Quarterly emerged during a long train journey with a friend who shared Howarth's enthusiasm for the Week. '[We thought] its readers have got loads of money, they must be interested in spending that money on interiors, accessories, on food, drink and travel... all the fluffy stuff.' </p> <p>He pitched the idea to Dennis Publishing, and founder Connell, thinking: 'He's either going to get it or he's going to think I'm a Martian.' Both liked the idea of short pieces by experts, not journalists. 'It's the people who actually make that world giving you an insight into that world. Alexander McQueen on Christmas gifts for a bloke. Simon Berry [of wine merchants Berry brothers] telling us what wine we should be buying and Jimmy Choo's creative director Tamara Mellon on stilettos.' Crucially: 'There are no features, the entire magazine is columns. There are no big reads.' </p> <p>Howarth is a magazine junkie, a fan of the great global magazine brands like Rolling Stone, Life and Vogue . 'The reason I fell in love with magazines was because of old issues of American Esquire with Mohammed Ali on the cover, 60s Vogue and 80s Vanity Fair. ' Even so, he's pessimistic about where the next landmark title will come from, arguing that the big players are too obsessed with scale. Even his old employer Cond\u00e9 Nast is chasing the mass market, launching Glamour and Easy Living . 'Where is the next Face coming from?' he says. 'Probably from the same place it has always come from; five people sitting around a kitchen table. But it's so competitive now, it's difficult to get past issue two'.</p>",
  "<p>Once in a very rare while you read or learn or hear or see something which makes your jaw drop, with shock or anger or, in this case, stunned delight.</p> <p>The jaw drops and the head sags and the tongue decides it wants to loll about like a recently stunned herring, and tiny little bubbles of fleck form at the side of the mouth: a delightful spasm to observe, I'm sure, in 1953 if you happened to be a Bulgarian state torturer in a wet concrete bunker with an eyepatch and foetid beetroot-breath and fond leanings towards psychopathy and a claw for a hand, but less so perhaps for my breakfast companions on Thursday (but, then again, maybe they shouldn't start serving Manhattans quite so early, at the Savoy).</p> <p>What I was reading was a quote from the judge in that hearing about the couple who were charged phenomenal - well bank -like - rates for a \u00a35,750 loan for a new boiler. The lovely judge, who was called Nigel Howarth - get Che and Marx off your walls, you doe-eyed dreamers, Nige is the New Hope - decreed something extraordinary, as he cast official, legal, doubts on the fact that the couple must now give the lenders \u00a3384,000.</p> <p>Here was a judge, for goodness' sake, and what he was coming out with was not, for once, the same mantra which every last man-jack and lady-sally of us has grown up with since birth: facts are facts, greed is greed, small print is small print, signatures are signatures, usury is usury and anyone in the whole fat history of capitalism who has ever sat on the board of anything is a venal shitweasel.</p> <p>No, What he said was this: the loan rate was 'so potentially exorbitant that it does grossly contravene the ordinary principles of fair dealing'.</p> <p>Well. Perhaps you can imagine my delight. The idea of fairness, suddenly enshrined in law ! It was like hearing a mumbled radio bulletin - 'Death now optional'. Like a little rabbit reading a headline, in Rabbit Post - 'No need to run away from anything, ever again!' The perennial cry of the adolescent - 'It's not fair' - was now sanctioned, and rightly so, because many of us are now adults and so, because we've put away the moronity of adolescence as well as all the fun, when we say, 'It's not fair,' we often truly mean it, because it often truly isn't.</p> <p>That same day, a survey reported that modern British banks are now less trusted than door-to-door salesmen. And that same day, a nicely-turned exercise in London's Evening Standard revealed that citizens of the capital are far more honest than generally perceived, nine out of 10 of them - nine real people, photographed, running and waving - giving the reporter back a tenner she'd deliberately left in the cash machine.</p> <p>Customers are now, for the first time in history, more honest than the banks they use. And the idea of 'fairness' has now been upheld in law. Surely, therefore, it's time for the honest and the unjustly treated, those who hand money back when given too much change (by a real person, in a real shop or some such), and yet simply weep gently on hard tables when opening our lousy bank statements to see more evidence of vast corporate robbery, to go to the lawyers, to call in the concept of 'fairness', and win back for the country some sanity.</p> <p>And, yes, while we're at it, let's sue the Yanks for the unfairness of pretending to us all that they're under any kind of threat from anything, while simultaneously being the greatest massed power this universe has known, non-existent deities included. Bless God, America.</p>",
  "<p>In just a little over five months we will likely be at the start of the next general election. My bet is on 5 May 2005, which would be called in the first or second week of April next year. </p> <p>The public is increasingly worried about the state of Britain's economy. Nearly four people in 10 (38 per cent) now say they think that the British economy will get worse, more than three times the 12 per cent who think it will get better. The Mori Economic Optimism Index is those who think the economy will improve, less those who think it will get worse, a net -26. Last month the index was -22 (14 per cent optimistic, 36 per cent pessimistic). </p> <p>There is no doubt that the management of the economy will play an important role in determining the majority, if not the outcome, of the general election. That's not to say it is top of people's minds, because most think the Chancellor has it under control. </p> <p>Since the 2001 general election, there has not been a single month in which public opinion has been more optimistic than pessimistic about the general economic future of the country. In April 2001, the month before the general election, only one person in six thought the economy would improve and four in 10 thought it would get worse, for a net -22, yet Labour was still returned with a landslide. </p> <p>Although only one in seven people are currently optimistic about the economy next year, when asked if they think in the longer term that this government's economic policies will improve the state of Britain's economy, the optimists jump to 39 per cent of people in the latest Mori Delivery Index, while 47 per cent are negative. But among those likely to vote, the figures are 45 /45. </p> <p>One person in four, 24 per cent, says that the management of the economy is one of the two or three issues that will be most important in determining their vote, putting it in seventh place behind the NHS, education, law and order, pensions, asylum seekers/immigration and tax. Among those who think the economy important, Labour's policies are preferred by 33 per cent, while the Tories score 30, and the Liberal Democrats 9, a +3 for the Labour government. But at the 2001 general election, Labour led the Conservatives by 34 points on the management of the economy. </p> <p>Much comment recently has focused on Labour's weakness with prospective women voters, which was brought out in the Fawcett Society report. Some of this can be attributed to the fact that there are more elderly women than men. This has two consequences: first, women are more likely to vote Conservative than men, and older women are more likely to vote Tory than their younger sisters. </p> <p>We find that women are significantly less optimistic than men that the economy will improve over the next year. While 17 per cent of men are optimistic, the figure for women is just one in 10. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> MORI interviewed a representative sample of 1,031 adults aged 18+ at 186 sampling points across Great Britain, in-home on 21-27th October 2004.

  "<p>It's high noon for Britain's multi-billion pound lending industry as a range of government measures are introduced, starting today, to clean up everything from mainstream mortgages to back-street lenders. </p> <p>Today sees the introduction of mortgage regulation by the Financial Services Authority, bringing the policing of home loans into line with investments. Mortgage advisers - those working for lenders and also brokers - must know their products and will become accountable for the advice they give. </p> <p>Today also sees the introduction of amendments to the Consumer Credit Act aimed at producing fair, clear advertising for credit cards and other forms of consumer borrowing. In the Queen's Speech in November, consumer groups are expecting a new consumer credit bill which would, among other things, make it easier for borrowers to challenge loans where extortionate rates of interest and unfair charges were buried in small print. </p> <p>Which?, the consumer organisation, hopes that the legislation will allow people with existing contracts - rather than just new ones - to challenge unfair terms. There will also be an overhaul of the consumer credit licensing system, which is widely accepted to be almost laughably inadequate. </p> <p>In the wake of last week's court judgment in favour of a couple whose \u00a35,750 second mortgage for home improvements grew to \u00a3384,000, Which? believes that lenders are living on borrowed time. </p> <p>Not all are villains, and many borrowers are their own worst enemies. But the old regime was not up to the job of dealing with one of our most ferociously competitive industries, where the market players are owed more than \u00a31 trillion by their customers.</p>",

His two most recent movies have been characteristically talkative but uncharacteristically political, and deal with aristocratic exiles in Paris. The first, The Lady and the Duke, takes place during the French Revolution and centres on an English woman who remains a royalist while her ex-lover, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, becomes a deputy and votes for the king's execution. The protagonist of the new picture, <strong>Triple Agent</strong>, set in Paris between 1937 and 1943, is a White Russian working for an emigre organisation in Paris. </p> <p>In 1957, Rohmer and Claude Chabrol wrote the first serious book on Alfred Hitchcock, and while the influence of the master has been a regular feature of Chabrol's movies, Triple Agent is Rohmer's first venture into the espionage thriller. There are echoes of Foreign Correspondent , Torn Curtain and other Hitchcock pictures But there isn't a gun or a McGuffin in sight and politics are not a pretext as they usually are for Hitchcock. The social background of the Popular Front, industrial unrest and the Spanish Civil War is established through excerpts from contemporary newsreels. Otherwise most of the film is spent indoors, in apartments, offices and restaurants. </p> <p>Fyodor (Serge Renko) is a handsome ex-general in his late thirties, with a son in the Soviet Union he hasn't seen since he fled to the West in 1922. He has been married to a Greek painter, Arsino\u00e9 (Katerina Didaskalu), for 12 years, but we discover that she doesn't really know him and he deliberately acts in an ambiguous, withdrawn manner. What he says and thinks are different things, and maybe he doesn't know where he stands, or for what. Is he secretly conspiring with the Nazis? Is he considering returning to Russia, and if so is it the pull of the Motherland or a desire to join the winning side? Is he a cynic, an idealist, a realist, a fantasist? He believes himself to be playing an influential role in politics, but is he himself being manipulated? </p> <p>Rohmer creates a world of suspicion and uncertainty through body language and through dialogues between Fyodor and Arsino\u00e9 and conversations with their communist neighbours who may be spying on them, and with other Russian emigres. The action, as in a Greek drama, is going on elsewhere. Like Arsino\u00e9 we're left to imagine the circumstances of killings, abductions and clandestine meetings, and we are drawn into the movie as into a thriller. It's an exciting, intelligent, satisfying picture, but it may be, like the favourite food of its leading character, caviar to the general. </p> <p>Prefaced with the modest claim 'Inspired by True Events', Marc Forster's <strong> Finding Neverland</strong> is a highly contrived account of how the childless, unhappily married JM Barrie came to write Peter Pan through his friendship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (a widow in the movie) and her four young sons. As an account of the theatrical life, Topsy-Turvy, Mike Leigh's film on the creation of The Mikado, is infinitely superior. But this is an enjoyable and touching film, if a trifle uncertain in its diction and sense of period. The chief strength resides in an outstanding performance by Johnny Depp as Barrie, who captures the writer's sense of fun, his sadness, intelligence, compassion and empathy, as well as bringing off a perfect Scottish accent. Kate Winslet is a fetching Sylvia. Dustin Hoffman is delightfully droll and has all the best lines as the celebrated American impresario Charles Frohman. </p> <p><strong> Little Black Book </strong> is the uncertain American debut of the TV director Nick Hurran, who had nowhere to go but up after his British feature debut, Girls' Night, a film partly set in the States. This one takes place in a New Jersey TV station where the young heroine, Stacy (Brittany Murphy), is a junior associate producer in a raucous Jerry Springer-style daytime talk show featuring Kathy Bates. Experiencing retrospective jealousy while contemplating her lover's three ex-girlfriends, she infiltrates their lives, pretending to be auditioning them for the show, and is egged on by an embittered older colleague (Holly Hunter) who has her own secret agenda. Hurran moves the action briskly along, but as satire it's toothless. Playing the conniving senior producer, Stephen Tobolowsky is good as always. </p> <p>Altogether funnier is <strong> Saved!</strong>, the promising debut of Brian Dannelly. It's yet another American high-school comedy with the usual dramatis personae (the smart trio of arrogant girls who rule the roost, the clever boy ignored in favour of the jocks, the tough female outsider viewing the place with contempt) and ending with the predictable prom night climax. The big twist is that everyone involved from the nutty headmaster (Martin Donovan) downwards is a born-again Christian zealot. There's a big picture of Bush beside the blackboard and a Creationism chart on the classroom wall, and the girls are 'Promise Makers', dedicated to preserving their virginity until marriage. But Mary (Jena Malone) discovers her boyfriend is gay and a vision of Jesus tells her to save him by letting him take her maidenhood. Concealing the resulting pregnancy for the next eight months, she loses her faith. The first half-hour is very funny and the rest mildly amusing until the painfully sentimental cop-out in the final 15 minutes. </p> <p>The term 'prequel' was coined not long after the release of William Friedkin's now classic 1973 horror movie The Exorcist to describe pictures like Renny Harlin's <strong> Exorcist: The Beginning</strong>. This looks at the early life of Father Lancaster Merrin (played in The Exorcist by Max von Sydow and here by his fellow Swede, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), how he lost his faith observing Nazi brutality in the Second World War, and regained it in Kenya in 1949 during an encounter with Lucifer himself. It's as heavy and flat-footed as Godzilla, neither scary nor theological engaging. Paul Schrader shot and edited a version of this film, which the producers scrapped in its entirety for being too serious and insufficiently horrific. It cannot be worse than Harlin's picture and is to be released on DVD next year. </p> <p>Robert Greenwald is a prolific producer of TV movies, mini-series and some theatrical features, who since 2001 has devoted himself to making political documentaries, starting with Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election . The driving force behind them is his conviction that the mainstream media have been failing in their duty to cover complex and controversial issues. His <strong> Uncovered: The War on Iraq</strong>, as impressive in its way as David Hare's play Stuff Happens, lines up 26 witnesses with years of experience in the military, intelligence agencies, the diplomatic corps, the US cabinet, the United Nations and the Department of Defence, to refute one by one the various reasons given by the Bush Administration for the invasion of Iraq. There is no commentary other than their words, illustrated by maps, documents and news footage, and the effect is coolly devastating. It is encouraging for those who believe in the fundamental good sense, decency and disinterestedness of America's intellectual leadership at its best to hear these men and women speak out with such frankness and lucidity.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Corporation</strong><br> (124 mins, PG) Directed by Mark Achbar, Jennifer Abbott; starring Milton Friedman, Ray Anderson, Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein</p> <p>Much of the most interesting, most urgent film-making of the past couple of years, especially in North America, has been in the documentary field, and the majority of the films are directly or obliquely political. They're a reaction, in part at least, against the false balance and censorship of TV, against the blandness of mainstream cinema and the solipsism and social disengagement of small-scale, independent productions. And they appeal to us <sub> </sub>because we live in a world of spin and image manipulation that makes it increasingly difficult to recognise what is real and authentic. </p> <p>The most striking success this year, of course, has been Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 , winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes and a box-office success the world over. But there's also been My Architect, Capturing the Friedmans, Super Size Me, The Fog of War, The Control Room, and now The Corporation, a long, sharp, polemical work, co-directed by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott and written by Joel Bakan, all of whom, as Canadians, bring a particular critical perspective to bear upon the United States. </p> <p>Abbott and Achbar are film-makers with a specific interest in the environment, the ecology and globalisation. Bakan is a lawyer and the author of a book on corporations with the blunt subtitle, 'The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power' which announces the film's central thrust. The movie argues that over the past 150 years business corporations have steadily grown to dominate the world, determining lives, overriding governments, depleting the world's resources, polluting the atmosphere. In the United States, lawyers, who are a form of corporate heavy artillery, took the Four teenth Amendment of the Constitution, originally designed to protect free slaves, and used it to have corporations attain the legal status of persons. But they are persons designed, and legally compelled, to pursue profit without concern for the human consequences. </p> <p>The film is hard-hitting but not hectoring, and among the 40-odd witnesses are eloquent spokesmen for capitalism, among them the gnome-like Milton Friedman, Lady Thatcher's favourite economist and the most right-wing person ever to win a Nobel Prize, and the likeable Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, former chairman of Shell. Sir Mark's home (as shown in some TV footage) was besieged by ecological commandos, who ended up being entertained to a picnic-cum-seminar on the family lawn. </p> <p>The movie and most of its contributors make a distinction between the people who run organisations and the institutions themselves. The most striking person in the film, a hero of sorts, is Ray Anderson, the CEO of Interface, the largest carpet manufacturer, who has been converted to the cause of sustainability and has made this the test of all his company's activities. But in one of the most amusing of the film's dozen chapters, the corporation itself as an entity is subjected to a psychiatric examination and diagnosed as a classic psychopath. </p> <p>One of the chapters, 'The Price of Whistleblowing', initially seems to be something of a diversion from the movie's main theme. It examines the case of two investigative journalists, Jane Akre and Steve Wilson, hired by Fox News, Rupert Murdoch's TV channel, and then put through legal hell when they made a programme exposing a synthetic hormone marketed by Monsanto to boost milk production. They highlighted the potential health risk of the product, to both cows and milk drinkers. But after threats from Monsanto's lawyers, Fox itself pursued the journalists, although a jury was persuaded that their claims had been true. This incident not only exposes the way in which conglomerates work together to protect their mutual interests, but also explains why Achbar, Abbott and Bakan don't work for the likes of Murdoch. </p> <p>This is a movie to see, ponder and discuss. It's disturbing but, ultimately, not despairing. It points to ways in which people can fight back. Just to hear an American corporate adviser say that the ultimate goal of capitalism is to have someone (preferably a corporation) own every square inch of the globe makes the blood boil and encourages one to seek some kind of action. </p> <p>A major question raised is why so many people now believe that anything privately run for profit is preferable to anything publicly run for the general good. The members of our corporation-loving government would be healthier for exposing both their minds and consciences to this film.</p>",
  "<p>Think back to the 1980s - Bradford, Heysel, Hillsborough, Thatcher, hooligans, ID cards - and it is easier to understand why the 1990s was the most important decade for football in this country since the Football League was founded in the 1880s. As spectators were treated less like animals and more like human beings, most, though by no means all of them, began to behave better. Businesses invested in the game. The Premier League was created, the Champions League, too, and Sky's TV money changed a local, provincial game into something altogether different. A new audience was attracted to football; crowds grew year after year, from 20,000 per match in the top division to more than 30,000. </p> <p>Football became more than a game, and there will be no turning back. Whether this is a good or a bad thing is open to question. It happened. </p> <p>There are half a dozen images that define this decade of change, which help to show why football widened its appeal. First, and most important, is the sight of Paul Gascoigne crying into his England shirt after being booked in the 1990 World Cup semi-final against West Germany. Unaggressive and emotional, a billboard image that helped to start an apparently unstoppable surge in popularity for the national team. </p> <p>'Poor Gazza - the human side of football' was the unwritten caption, even if poor England made his tears irrelevant by losing on penalties. There followed, in the next eight years, memorable front-page images of poor Gary, poor Gareth, and poor David. Lineker was substituted in his last England appearance in Euro 92, Southgate's miss led to another shoot-out defeat against the Germans in the Euro 96 semi-final, and Beckham was sent off for kicking the Argentine Diego Simeone in the 1998 World Cup, in another game that England would lose on penalties. </p> <p>It took a while for Beckham to win the sympathy vote, but he got there in the end. As did the grey shirts of Bayern Munich, who provided one of the two unforgettable images from club football in the 1990s: their defenders flat out in tears after conceding two goals in the last minute of the 1999 Champions League final, which Manchester United won to become the first, and to date only, English champions of Europe since the arrival of 'new football'. </p> <p>The other abiding image from club football is the violent and truly shocking picture of Eric Cantona leaping over an advertising hoarding to kick Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons at Selhurst Park on 25 January 1995. Cantona had just been sent off, Simmons came down 11 rows to tell him to 'Fuck off back to France, you French motherfucker', or 'French bastard' depending on whose version you accept. Cantona crossed a line no player had crossed before in English football: he attacked a fan. </p> <p>There was a fascination in this Hollywood moment that goes into the dark world of 'the glamour of violence' as a recent book on boxing by Kevin Mitchell was subtitled. Cantona's kick was unquestionably glamorous: because it was Cantona (dressed all in black), because it was Manchester United, because it had never happened before, because it was so shocking. </p> <p>Was there sympathy for Cantona? Never, judging by the media coverage of what Trevor Brooking, among others, described as 'the most horrendous incident involving a player I have ever witnessed at an English football ground'. </p> <p>The most commonly used adjective in the coverage of Cantona's assault, and the subsequent court case and nine-month ban from football imposed on the Frenchman, was 'shameful'. As the 10th anniversary of 'kung-fu Cantona' draws near, it is tempting to look back and ask: shameful for whom? </p> <p>To Cantona and his club, certainly. He deserved his lengthy ban. But apart from three or four articles, and most notably a column by Jimmy Greaves in the Sun, nobody in the national press asked the most important question of all: why? Why had it happened? </p> <p>The who, what, where and when of the Selhurst Park incident were detailed in many thousands of words and the widespread conclusion was that Cantona should be banned for life from 'the game that's dying of shame'. But why, apart from the obvious loss of self-control, did Cantona do something quite so outrageous? </p> <p>'We've heard a lot about Cantona's responsibilities,' Greaves wrote. 'What about analysing the responsibility of Simmons and every foul-mouthed yob who thinks his \u00a310 admission gives him the right to say what he likes to a man... to abuse, taunt, spit and behave in a way that would get you locked up if you repeated it in the high street.' </p> <p>Tom Carty, who was at the match, is one of the senior figures in the British advertising industry and has worked with Cantona, whom he describes as 'a warm, kind, genuine, creative man, a thinker', on film shoots. He believes some good came of the kick. </p> <p>'It made people think twice about how they behave, about abusing a player,' he says. 'The behaviour of some fans was so bad, so tribalistic. There was so much hate. If Simmons had stayed in his seat, no one would ever have questioned his behaviour, but it needed questioning. </p> <p>'Just imagine if a black player had done that in the 1970s - someone like Clyde Best when they were chucking bananas at him. There would have been a riot. But it would have changed the way people behaved, some good would have come of it. Maybe that's what happened with Cantona.' </p> <p>There are those, particularly in south London, who believe Cantona got off lightly, that the Manchester United PR machine made racism an issue when it was not. John Barnes was never part of the Old Trafford spin machine. Here's his view in 2004: 'It's very ironic that it took a white Frenchman to bring home to the nation the issue of racism in football.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Brian Oliver is sports editor of The Observer</p>",
  "<p>I first encountered Ronnie O'Sullivan in Preston, more than a decade ago. The UK snooker championship was taking place down the road. He was with a couple of friends sitting on some hotel steps. Dressed in tracksuits they exuded a faint air of menace. O'Sullivan, who made his first century break aged 10 and his first 147 at 15, was the cocky one with very dark hair. Everyone knew he was supposed to be the coming kid. The next time I saw him was at Wembley about three years later. Now an established pro, he stalked the table, a forceful, overpowering presence. He was heavily built and looked like an extra from Oliver! who had been squeezed into a dinner suit. He looked at the balls with his mouth open, scowling. His talent appeared somehow a separate entity to himself. </p> <p>Now we meet at the Groucho Club in Soho, where O'Sullivan is launching his new DVD, Ronnie's Snooker Hot Shots. This is familiar territory for O'Sullivan - his father, Ron, owned a chain of sex shops around here. Ronnie enters diffidently, smiling. His desire to be liked is both surprising and readily apparent. He had won the British Grand Prix 48 hours previously with a series of bravura performances, outrageous even. He switched from right to left-handed with a nonchalance that brooked disbelief. He looked slimline and completely focused. No one could live with him. He was beginning to exert a Lance Armstrong-style dominance on the peloton of snooker pros. </p> <p>There was the following exchange on television between Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor after O'Sullivan had made his 371st televised century break. Davis: 'I don't see how you can improve on this standard. Total control of the cue ball.' Taylor: 'He's got that cue ball on a string.' </p> <p>Davis: 'It is a truly devastating standard and I think this gentleman is moving this game to new levels.' </p> <p>Yet today O'Sullivan is not pleased with himself. He orders a salmon sandwich and eats half of it desultorily. 'It was quite strange,' he says, eager to talk. 'For the whole tournament I was really struggling. The only thing I looked forward to was practising with Ray.' </p> <p>Ray is the former six-times world champion Ray Reardon. O'Sullivan's father enlisted him to curb his son's 'wayward tendencies'. In his post-victory interview O'Sullivan had thanked Reardon profusely. He explains: 'He doesn't tell me anything technically. It's just a relationship between two people who know the game. Me and Ray are quite telepathic really. My father contacted him and I gave him a ring later. There's a way to play the game. Positional play, really. Keep control of the cue ball. I'm a good potter and he was a good potter. It's hard to describe. We just have a laugh. He should go on the stage. He has me in stitches.' </p> <p>It goes without saying that O'Sullivan's father remains a powerful influence in his life. As a child Ronnie Jr was ferried to and from snooker clubs and looked after in every respect. The money from the sex shops meant that no expense was spared in helping him pursue his goal. He had his own purpose-built snooker room at the family's Essex home. He was allowed to leave school a year early on condition that he did roadwork every morning and only went into snooker clubs to practise and nothing else; a snooker table worth several thousand pounds was installed in one club. </p> <p>Anyone who met O'Sullivan snr could expect the proud prediction that 'Little Ron' would one day be world champion. Then, suddenly, he was gone. In his autobiography, Ronnie, O'Sullivan writes: 'Dad and his mate were in a nightclub arguing over who should pay the bill [his father, he says, insisted on paying for everything]. Then two black fellas, brothers who had been signed in that night by Charlie Kray, got the wrong end of the stick and thought Dad and his mate weren't going to pay. A row started. Dad said, \"Let's talk about it\", and walked round the bar, where one of the brothers picked up an ashtray and went to whack Dad over the head. Dad put up his hand, the ashtray smashed and two of his fingers were severed. The other fella then picked up a champagne bottle and smashed Dad over the head with it. Dad then picked up a knife that was on the side of the bar and that was it.' </p> <p>In September 1992, the trial judge, mindful of what he said in his summing-up were 'racial overtones', sentenced Ron O'Sullivan to 18 years in prison for murder. Shortly before he went to jail, Ron had told his son that he must choose between snooker and Pippa, his then girlfriend. Pippa went. </p> <p>In November 1993, aged 17 years and 11 months, Ronnie won the UK championships. A year later, his mother, Maria, was jailed for a year for tax evasion after police had mounted an 18-month surveillance operation. The still teenage O'Sullivan was left in Essex looking after his younger sister, Danielle. He also had to keep the sex-shop business going. Amazingly, at his trial, his father had managed to acquire another shop in Brewer Street during a break in proceedings. Left on his own, O'Sullivan went on an orgy of drinking and drug-taking. He then became addicted to food instead and put on three stone. He was treated for depression. </p> <p>While his reputation within the game was rising, in between tournaments he visited his mother and father in prison. Cocooned among minders, he has often seemed in search of guidance from father-figures. The world championship that had appeared inevitable after such feats as his 5min 20sec 147 break during the 1997 tournament eluded him. He looked lost. He frequently talked of giving up entirely. He checked into the Priory and, in his own words, he 'got his life back'. In 2001 he became world champion for the first time. But he relapsed. His father believed he was keeping the wrong company. Hence the phone call from prison to Reardon. </p> <p>It worked. This year, it has got even better. Now 29 and still unmarried, O'Sullivan is again snooker champion of the world and, more importantly, kept the momentum going with no sign of another fall. </p> <p>'My father has been brilliant,' he says now. There is a snooker table in the room, but he shows no interest in it. He draws on a Marlboro Light. 'He's given me everything. If I don't want to do it for myself I can do it for him. I just want people to come from the heart. I've had hangers-on for six months or a year but you find out in the end. I was hanging out with the wrong people.' </p> <p>A man in his mid-fifties named Vic Andrews enters the room midway through our interview. He is gaunt and well dressed. He does not talk. He simply observes. I ask O'Sullivan if he is aware of the comments of Steve Davis and others, who believe he has taken the game to a new level. O'Sullivan is not convinced. 'It's going to be the same in another 10 years,' he says. 'There'll be someone like you sitting there talking to someone like me. I've just won a tournament and I didn't play to my best. I'm not satisfied, but anyone can have feelings of disillusion.' </p> <p>O'Sullivan remains prone to depression and sometimes even self-loathing. I suggest that for all the influence of his father, Reardon and members of 'Team O'Sullivan' such as Vic, surely it is he alone who has achieved this remarkable turnaround in his fortunes. He is startlingly pleased. 'Yes, a lot of the time I'd look for outside influences,' he says. 'But I'm starting to give myself more credit now. I'm me at the end of the day. I used to think it was other people.' </p> <p>He leans back and smiles trustingly. His vulnerability is palpable and rather shocking. He's the champ. Surely he should be cock of the walk? 'I've always been in search of something,' he says. 'Serenity, happiness. A lot of times I've not been happy. Voices in my head. In 2001 at the Priory I went on a spiritual ... now I don't go round the angles. I go straight to the thing. Like playing left-handed. Or going to the Buddhist centre. Then when I'm ready to go back into the nuttiness of the world, I will.' </p> <p>These random if somehow charming thoughts then provoke a denial that he is a Buddhist, or indeed a Muslim - the latter rumour being sparked by his friendship with the boxer Prince Naseem Hamed. 'We were just mates and I got to know his family well. We met up quite a bit. I was just inquisitive [about Islam]. He sat me down and we had some deep chats. How to live your life well and all that. He says he'd rather have been a snooker player than a boxer but then he said, \"But I do love knocking people out\".' </p> <p>He became interested in Buddhism after being approached in Soho by a complete stranger. Most people in his position would have walked on by, one feels, but not O'Sullivan. 'Yeah, some fella came up to me, a dentist I think he'd been, and said, \"Read this book and tell me what you think.\" The book was called The Power of Now. And I read it and phoned him up and said thanks. What was the book's message? Stop thinking and stop being mad. Express yourself. It's only knowledge. People just feel they've got to say something but they've only learnt it from someone else. Often they're just talking crap. This book is just my little journey. If ever my mind's whizzing it's what I go back to. I've tried everything. I've tried religion, Prozac. They've never done it for me.' </p> <p>And then there is the structure of the snooker season. 'I get four or five months off every summer,' he continues. 'It bores me. I want to be playing. I want to be with Ray. You get restless.' </p> <p>Understandably, when his mind is 'whizzing' it is generally revolving around the subject of his father. He cannot phone him and has to wait for calls from prison. 'He's not a violent man. Psychologists have said that. Hopefully someone will do something about it. They made an example of him for some reason. I get really wound up about it. Sometimes I sit there counting the days until he is out. It would make everything sweeter if he was out. Then I could do it for myself and not for him. I said to him once, \"I want to come in and do some time with you\". But he said, \"This place is for losers\". He's helped a lot of people inside.' </p> <p>He lights another cigarette. Talking to O'Sullivan you suspect that a part of him remains frozen on the day his father was taken away. He tells me that winning is sometimes the worst thing: 'You can be there but then you think, hold on, I'd swap being the best snooker player in the world for happiness any day. It's a juggling act. But being a snooker player is what I do. It gives me a buzz a lot of the time.' </p> <p>A few days later I ring Vic Andrews. I want to speak to Ray Reardon but that, Andrews tells me, would not be a good idea. It is best that I speak to him. Andrews says he will tell it like it is, within parameters obviously. 'He was actually going away from keeping control,' he says of O'Sullivan. 'But when Ray [Reardon] came along he was able to talk to him about that. Ray is almost the final piece of the puzzle. He fits tremendously well into the team.' </p> <p>Ronnie certainly seems to have got his control back. 'The battle is an ongoing thing,' Andrews says. 'Ronnie can suffer from depression. In the midst of everyone's joy and happiness you can feel absolutely shit. Ronnie's peace of mind is the most important thing. If you go back to a couple of seasons ago people began to say, \"He's likely to go on a wobbly\".' </p> <p>What exactly does Andrews do, I ask him, since he appears to be a key member of the team. Anyone who wants to contact O'Sullivan has to 'go through Vic'. Andrews will not tell me anything about himself. It is not important, he says. And he does not get paid. 'I look after things,' he says. 'But we don't call me a manager. A nephew of mine was a snooker player. With Ronnie we don't stay in hotels. We rent places, farmhouses, out of the way. It's not a false environment.' </p> <p>What of the idea that O'Sullivan is in search of father-figures? 'We're not father-figures,' Andrews says. 'Ronnie's had a lot of contact with his dad.' </p> <p>So who pulls the strings, if anyone does? 'His father takes a great pleasure in watching. Ron is there for Ronnie. Sometimes Ron will sound off to little Ron but that's how any father is.' </p> <p>I was thinking back to the Groucho and the way, when the photographer had asked him to take his shoes off and lie on the snooker table, O'Sullivan had agreed without demur. Looking down on him lying there I asked him whom he thought were the major threats for next year's world championship, starting with the most threatening in descending order. He replied, without hesitation: 'Hunter, Williams, Higgins, Hendry, Stevens. Doherty.' He added: 'With certain players you can't give them an inch. They come to tournaments to win them. With others, they're decent players but they're missing something.' </p> <p>He considers Hendry to be the best of all time. 'He had the most bottle. The greatest. If he's playing well I'd put my money on him.' </p> <p>Mark Williams was the most talented of his generation. However, he observed that Williams had just had a baby and this might be affecting his game. 'A very talented player. But sometimes I just think you just lose your way.' And Ebdon? 'He observes a lot of things. Like light bulbs.' Doherty he grew up with in the clubs of Ilford and Barking. O'Sullivan admired Doherty and modelled his cueing style on his for a time. When Doherty won a tournament they put bunting up in the club, but with O'Sullivan they didn't bother. He puts it down to jealousy - perhaps his father's money. He concedes he could be 'horrible' while he was growing up, only behaving if his father was present. He was banned from one club even though he was by far their most lucrative client. Now Doherty, a friend, is in his wake. </p> <p>O'Sullivan now has a girlfriend, Jo, whom he met at Narcotics Anonymous. He is relieved not to be alone. 'If I'm on my own a lot, I'll do funny things like clean the car or clear out my cupboard.' </p> <p>He mentioned rather spectrally a former contemporary from the old days, Chris Callan, who was his equal but disappeared to Amsterdam and is now, he thought, working on a building site. 'He played all the shots. But Chris didn't have the same type of people as me behind him. They were more the hustler type. He wasn't playing the best players week in, week out. When I emerged it was as a hardened match-player.' </p> <p>For Ronnie O'Sullivan his life and success seem bound inextricably with the question of identity. And he may at last be in the process of eclipsing the mysterious support-system that surrounds him. As he says, it is just him now. </p> <p>As he lay on the snooker table with his shoes off I put to him that the next stage of his career might be the Lance Armstrong one, of total dominance. 'I follow the Tour de France, actually,' he said. 'And when Armstrong was six or seven minutes behind a few people thought he was finished, but he was quite comfortable. He knew what he was doing and was exactly where he wanted to be.' </p> <p>Perhaps the same could be said of the new, remade Ronnie O'Sullivan. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Jonathan Rendall is the author of Twelve Grand: the Gambler as Hero (Yellow Jersey Press).

  "<p>Now Julia thinks back, the way her husband used to talk to her about Brian Aldridge's affair with Siobhan Hathaway in The Archers - it was unbelievable. Like everyone who listened to the radio soap, they despised Brian for cheating on his wife. All the lies! That was the awful thing. </p> <p>Julia had no idea what her own husband was up to. All the time, telling her he was having to go away to visit his sick father in Scotland. And of course, that's where she lived. In Scotland.</p> <p>Julia used to wonder why he used to drive up there, even though he hated driving and there was a train he could catch. When he moved into the spare room she thought he was just going through a mid-life crisis. OK, so their marriage was sort of bumbling along, but she supposed that's what it's like after 27 years. That's a long time to be married. The Archers had started as her passion. They lived in a farmhouse; she kept horses. Julia had been to see a horse up in North Yorkshire and was driving home down the A1 on a summer evening, fiddling with the radio, when she caught an episode. 'Oh. This sounds interesting.'</p> <p>And after that she got involved. And he did, too. She'd listen to the omnibus every Sunday, following each plotline. She bought one or two Archers books from charity shops, but most of the books he gave to her as presents. </p> <p>In September 2001 he and Julia went to the Archers 50th Anniversary Convention at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. It was brilliant. Julia talked to the cast and had her photograph taken with Sid Perks and Joe Grundy - he was lovely. And she line-danced with the actress who plays Hayley Tucker - who is Jasper Carrott's daughter. She realises later that it must have been not long after that that the affair started. It was an old girlfriend who'd contacted him on the internet.</p> <p>On 30 September 2002 he eventually told her. He stood there as she tore up all his Valentine cards. 'I'm a cold fish, aren't I?' he said. A cold wet fish. 'All I can say is I've gone off you.'</p> <p>And he left her. The shock of it. Julia lost two-and-a-half stone in a few weeks. Her doctor gave her medication to control the shakes. </p> <p>There were a lot of changes. She had to sell the horses; she couldn't afford them any more. But it's like they were part of her old life. Two years on, she doesn't think about him much any more. She tries not to. She doesn't care a button what happens to him. Her older son - he's 22 now - still sees his father: 'Mum, I know what he's done, but he's my dad.' But the younger boy, the 21-year-old, hasn't seen him since he left. They've been good to her; they're fantastic lads. And Julia? She's changed so much. They used to have this dark front room, all Victorian, with wall-to-wall books. She cleared it out, gave him the books, bought white sofas and put down laminate flooring.</p> <p>'Is this you?' people said.</p> <p>She's not sure, but she's finding out.</p> <p>She's put two stone back on. She couldn't afford to keep the farmhouse. The grass was growing long where the horses used to be. She's moved into a smaller place on the same estate as one of her sons. On Sunday morning, when the omnibus is on, she sits in her new conservatory, writing letters to let the banks and everyone else to tell them that she'll be using her maiden name from now on. She listens. But she can't seem to get back into The Archers, somehow.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Superhero for Hire: True Stories from the Small Ads by William Shaw is published by Observer Books</p>",
  "<p>Amelia Gregory is a self-confessed control freak. She was a stylist for The Face, Arena and The Guardian, then took up photography because: 'I'd style a shoot and then the photographer would take rubbish pictures.' </p> <p>Gregory set up Amelia's Magazine this year. A one-woman product, the first issue, published in May, featured Christina Aguilera's stylist Victoria Adcock, a risque crossword compiled by DJ Tim Love Lee and exclusive flexidisc and prison diaries from rebel du jour Pete Doherty. 'I never thought he'd give that to me, but he did.' </p> <p>Things like this happen to Amelia. The next edition of the biannual publication (out on 8 November) includes a feature on Interpol, lunch with alpha DJ and producer Mylo, and a collaboration with advertising's favourite photographer, Nadav Kander.

It's got me good people in the magazine but hasn't got me far in my career, because I don't kiss ass.' </p> <p>If the positive responses to the first issue are anything to go by, Gregory will never need to.

  "<p>American etiquette rule No 1: try not to insult government ministers in public. It's March 2002 and Aaron McGruder, the creator of radical cartoon strip The Boondocks and ascendant African-American media firebrand, is accepting the Chairman's Award at the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) Image Awards.</p> <p>One small problem: he's been seated in the front row of the auditorium, near Condoleezza Rice. In his acceptance speech, he makes brief reference to this irony, denounces America's recent invasion of Afghanistan, then leaves the podium in relatively compliant style.</p> <p>Minutes later, he's mingling, when he feels a hand on his shoulder. He finds himself face-to-face with America's national security adviser. McGruder has never divulged full details of his conversation with Rice, except for the fact that he called her a mass-murderer ('in a clever way') and that she requested he write her into The Boondocks. </p> <p>McGruder insists the Rice fracas has become a millstone. He's holding back a full disclosure of the exchange for an autobiographical book, but he insists: 'Because everyone asks me about it and I never tell, it's going to be so uninteresting when I actually tell the story.' But he got back to Rice on her request in October 2003, suggesting that as a 'female Darth Vader' she might be less bent on destroying the world if she had a man in her life to give her 'some good old-fashioned lovin\". The Washington Post pulled the strip for a week; just another ban in the life of The Boondocks.</p> <p>Huey Freeman, the 10-year-old Don King-coiffed star of The Boondocks, stares out over Aaron McGruder's penthouse from a huge framed cover of liberal political weekly The Nation on the wall. His 30-year-old creator, diminutive, goateed and handsome, sits beneath him on a voluminous brown couch, where all the work on the strip takes place. We're on Beverly Hills' borders, just north of LA's vast Four Seasons hotel; McGruder tells how, a few nights ago, two police helicopters were hovering in the zone between the hotel and his apartment building, waiting to swoop on the city's latest outbreak of evil-doing.</p> <p>'I think something like 70 per cent of the jail population in America is non-violent drug offenders. So you know, we're still living in the era of prohibition,' he reflects. With his hair clipped much shorter than in the dust-jacket photo on the back of his latest Boondocks compendium, A Right To Be Hostile, McGruder no longer shares the topiary with Huey, but there's no mistaking where his schoolyard alter ego gets his politics from. On his beat around the middle-class suburb of Woodcrest where he lives with his grandad, Huey is perpetually pissed off with the status quo, whether it's Bush's stem-cell research policy or P Diddy's hip-hop clownery.</p> <p>On the September afternoon we meet, the latest batch of The Boondocks, syndicated to nearly 300 newspapers in the US, is giving McGruder a serious headache. Even with coy asterisks, several papers are objecting to his latest story line, 'Can a n**** get a job?', a spoof of Donald Trump's NBC show The Apprentice. McGruder balks at any changes. 'The strip's very personal to me - I don't wanna engage in dialogue about it.'</p> <p>Wednesday is supposedly his day off from the strip, but he's busy finalising details for the Boondocks TV show, which is about to go into a 62-week production schedule for its first series. Currently, he's testing voice actors for Huey - he's thinking of going with a girl, a la Bart Simpson. Among the names on the casting list are Fresh Prince of Bel Air starlet Tatyana Ali and fem-rapper MC Lyte.</p> <p>McGruder started drawing The Boondocks while studying African-American studies at the University of Maryland, grounding it in a combination of radical black politics and pop-culture roughage. He decided to use kids in the strip (Huey has an eight-year-old brother, wannabe gangster Riley) to 'seduce the audience' - Charles Schultz by way of Nation of Islam. 'You're taking someone [people] would maybe otherwise find unpleasant and making it pleasant to look at. And instantly, psychologically, the impact it has is tremendous.'</p> <p>With an anti-authoritarian instinct that later made him notorious, Jayson Blair (of the New York Times fabrication scandal), then editor of college paper The Diamondback, began running the strip in late 1996. Two years later, McGruder signed up with Universal Press Syndicate, which also published Doonesbury, and The Boondocks began running immediately in 160 papers - a large launch - and grew from there.</p> <p>The early days of the strip were 'very, very tough'. Compared to The Boondocks of 2004, which often features near-static panels of Huey slackly commenting on television, he was more ambitious. Plotlines were carefully interlacing and other characters featured more often: Huey and Riley's cantankerous grandad; Caesar, a dreadlocked schoolmate from Brooklyn; Tom Dubois, a cosy African-American lawyer whom Huey needed to periodically remind about Black Power; Tom's racially mixed daughter Jazmine, a bit stuck on the young revolutionary. </p> <p>The latter two have been all but erased from the strip now, but McGruder reckons they were a necessary sacrifice. Bad at meeting deadlines anyway, he found the Sisyphean nature of his labours dragging him under. 'If I had known how hard it was going to be, I may have thought twice before doing it ... Bringing the characters to life and exploring their personalities is tough to do in just two or three panels.' By 2000, he couldn't eat or sleep properly and was once hospitalised with acute gastrointestinal pains. It's obvious, looking at the increasingly self-referential strips from the period, that creative entropy had set in. Huey was fretting over filling his own bolshy newsletter, The Free Huey World Report, and handing over the logo for his impending insurrection, he moaned: 'I don't know why I gotta lead the revolution and illustrate it.' </p> <p>McGruder himself has ended up farming out the inking, but it was September 11 that really changed the strip. The attack fell on a Tuesday, his deadline day, giving him a week to decide whether he was going to touch the subject. Even hitting the national stage on the 25th with an initial swipe at glassy-eyed media patriotism, he was the first (Doonesbury followed later). 'I think this is where it helps to be a black American,' he says, \"cause I think for the most part as an ethnic group we are so much more suspicious of the government in general. I was never one of those people who thought this was the time to rally round the flag and support Bush. Because if he was an idiot on September 10, he was still an idiot on September 12.'</p> <p>McGruder's deadline problems disappeared and the strip, a previously loose sense of scorn, catalysed into a focused beam of outrage. It was too much for some: the New York Daily News banned The Boondocks for several weeks. As public criticism of the strip mounted, he fired back sarcastically, 'censoring' Huey and fellow conspirators for four days and replacing them with 'The Adventures of Flagee and Ribbon', a talking Stars and Stripes and a patriotic ribbon. McGruder suddenly found himself increasingly in demand on radio and TV as house iconoclast (as well as the subject of the odd flattering death threat - one was once phoned in at a restaurant he was eating in). 'What happened after 9/11, I think, was actually a very, very good thing in that I took on a greater importance, not only in the comics business, but also in the national dialogue about politics in general. Because nobody else wanted to criticise the government.' The Boondocks may have had to downsize, but its creator was on the up. Another flashpoint came last December, when McGruder let slip the n-word at a birthday dinner for The Nation at New York's Metropolitan Club. Dinner ($500 a head) over, and Uma Thurman stepped up to introduce the cartoonist. </p> <p>The assembled luminaries must have known about McGruder's Molotov reputation, but it's unlikely they anticipated that he would turn his scorched-earth policy on them - at their own dinner. He rubbished The Nation's liberalism, scoffing at its so-called 'courage' and accusing it of letting Bush and his administration go unchecked. Then came the clincher: he told diners he had voted for Ralph Nader in 2000. A Nation staff member shouted out, 'Thanks for Bush!' McGruder's response was to move his hand crotchwards and suggest that the journalist 'Try these nuts.'</p> <p>He disputes this account. 'I said the word \"Nader\". And that's all - that was it. My attitude is: we're sitting here at a really nice party, we're celebrating, but there's nothing to celebrate. We're getting our asses panned by George and we're sitting here drinking up.'</p> <p>He's intensely politicised, but it's 'a common-sense thing, being able to see when people are obviously lying', rather than any kind of Trotskyite upbringing. He was born on Chicago's South Side and, with his parents and older brother Dedric (also a part-time political cartoonist), moved to Columbia, Maryland, at the age of six. </p> <p>The Boondocks begins when the Freeman brothers make a similar move to the middle-class 'burb of Woodcrest. Apart from the liberal coasts, it's perhaps somewhere in this anonymous section of America's consciousness that McGruder finds his audience. 'I think it reaches a very sort of, er, large, quiet minority of people who understand the strip's sensibilities. Not the cross-section of people who live on television ... I think it's a lot of people who are quietly outraged at what's going on in the country, but who have no means to make their voice heard and have given up on the political system.'</p> <p>McGruder's attitude towards Bush and his government has been caustic since The Boondocks started, and the administration comes in for a roasting in another of his projects, the graphic novel Birth of a Nation. Co-written with House Party creator Reggie Hudlin, it's based on the Florida fiasco in 2000; after an impoverished black area in St Louis is gratuitously disenfranchised, it decides to secede from the Union. East St Louis becomes Blackland and lets Prince audition to write the national anthem, while scantily veiled versions of Bush and Cheney flap about how to rein in the recalcitrant state.</p> <p>He's currently laying into all-comers in the run-up to the 2004 election: Huey has been on the phone to John Kerry, marvelling at his incompetence; agog at Bush's stem-cell research phobia; and had Tom Dubois kidnap Democrat-wrecker Nader (McGruder is voting Democrat this time). 'I don't look at the strip as a tool for political change,' he says. 'I don't think it has that kind of power. It is just me telling jokes that I think are funny.'</p> <p>He's a friend of Michael Moore, who wrote the foreword to A Right To Be Hostile, praising The Boondocks as 'the most truthful thing in the newspapers'. McGruder cites Fahrenheit 9/11's $120m take as one of the few things in American political and cultural life that give him hope. But, he says, he'd be cautious about wielding the same level of influence as Moore. 'It comes with having to fear for your life ... He has to be concerned. Not even so much about the government as random weirdos and crazy people.'</p> <p>America has acquired a coterie of comic dissenters, including Moore; Garry Trudeau, whose Doonesbury enjoyed its own period of exile from 38 US newspapers in July; and David Rees, responsible for the excellently profane Get Your War On, co-opted by Rolling Stone - and McGruder is high among their ranks. He's unsure, though, whether Bush has been the gift to US satirists you'd expect. 'It's a big problem, because Bush is so stupid and has not changed or grown or matured at all in the last four years. And there's only so many times you can tell the same joke, y'know. But yet, he just stays stupid.' </p> <p>But behind this comment, you get the impression that the old boredom that stymied The Boondocks after the last election might be waiting to strike again and, still straitjacketed into three-panel 'comic claustrophobia', McGruder is still searching for the right outlet.</p> <p>'Man, that was boring.' McGruder is talking about a gruelling lunch with Fidel Castro on a trip he made to Cuba with a relief organisation. He's full of admiration for what Castro has achieved, flinging statistics around with professorial earnestness, about the education system and infant-mortality rates. But still, 'It was a one-hour talk stretched into, like, four hours.'</p> <p>Maybe McGruder needs to condense his efforts, too. The Boondocks, by his own admission in the foreword to A Right To Be Hostile, only splutters into clear-throated articulacy from time to time. Hemmed in by twentysomething detritus - Run DMC dolls, piles of comics, a pair of light-sabres, Clinton's biography, a photo of McGruder's Filipino girlfriend of three years, a portrait of the cartoonist by the late Richard Avedon, amid wooden African masks and arboreal potted plants - there's a sense of a certain restless creative promiscuity. As well as daily Boondocks duty and his non-fiction book, he's working on two screenplays: one about an African-American pilot drafted into an RAF kamikaze squad in the Second World War, another about a fictional beef, cooked up by two rival rappers, which gets out of hand.</p> <p>But the big hope, of course, is The Boondocks TV show. McGruder holds up The Simpsons as the obvious example of a show that 'works in a lot of politics without talking about the news'. To this end, as well as allowing him to break through the limitations of the daily strip, he's going to restore all the faces from the early days, as well as introduce newcomers to the neighbourhood. He's currently working on getting a 'very well-known' person to play himself.</p> <p>The Simpsons' network, Fox, actually passed on The Boondocks, due, McGruder says, to financial issues rather than any fear he might hack off the hand that feeds him. With the pilot episode completed in Korea and production under way, The Boondocks will now be the flagship show on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim strand.</p> <p>Only just 30, McGruder seems very much the Hollywood player now - even a celebrity. His idealism is long established, but you get the impression that the muscles he has built most assiduously since moving to LA five years ago are his corporate-diplomatic biceps. As we decamp to a cafe for lunch, he talks over a chicken burger about how much he likes giving lectures, even though he's a shy person. He always improvises his talks, he says, and enjoys the ability to control people's emotions. One favourite rhetorical tool of his is to lie to the audience at some point and own up later, because, pace 9/11 and Iraq, 'that's what the authorities do'. Plus, 'a little bit of notoriety' has its own benefits. He performs a cheeky calculation: if 500 people attend a lecture and half are girls, say 1 per cent will be good looking, then chances are if those two girls are prepared to wait half an hour in a queue to let you sign their Boondocks book, then they'll probably want to sleep with you. </p> <p>Strategy is what most progressives need, McGruder insists. With the Democrats equally caressed by the tendrils of big business, the radical fringe 'never figured out what to do when the devil was the only person in the room left to negotiate with. They just didn't know what to do.' He refuses to go down the same path. 'I don't see myself as any kind of political activist, mostly because I think what I do in the strip is more effective than anything I could do as an activist. I'll reach a lot more people than if I'm out there in the streets, marching with a sign or something, protesting. I've got other avenues to express myself.'</p> <p>I ask him if his brand of radicalism (and, with Boondocks merchandising on the way, a brand is what it will be) is in danger of becoming just another commodity for sale. He admits that, 'Money has to be your focus, because money is the focus of everyone you're in business with.' An ultra-bright, blinding admission of how traditional left/right polarities are meaningless in an era when bottom-line merchant Harvey Weinstein whips up a 'coalition of the willing' to distribute Fahrenheit 9/11, after Disney bottled it, and Nike-wearing twentysomethings go to see documentaries like the forthcoming (and very good) The Corporation for their anti-corporate lifestyle tonic.</p> <p>McGruder knows that with The Washington Post publishing his strip, Random House his books and Cartoon Network his TV show, he's as complicit as anyone. And he's getting rich without qualms. 'I always wanted to get rich. I wanna live very, very well. The world sucks when you're poor. It's fucking deplorable. But I don't think it means you have to be part of the fucked-up system of oppressors and leaders just by virtue of making a lot of money.'</p> <p>Can he stay principled? He's already turned down offers to rope Huey and co into commercials. 'I don't spend a lot of time moaning about what I can't get away with, because there's always other media. Rather than trying to be so radical, you just put yourself out of the game. Find the smart way to make the most out of these mass-media outlets. It still requires courage and it still requires pissing people off. You just have to know how to walk the tightrope ... If you're not disciplined, it can be dangerous. You're literally dancing with the devil.'</p> <p>McGruder takes a phone call from his assistant Shawn, fleshing out more details about the casting for take-no-prisoners grade-school guerrilla Huey. Then a burst of mild flirtation with the busty, synthetic-faced Beverly Hills waitress, and we leave. Rebel with a stencil or media Faustus? If being Aaron McGruder was ever for sale, if there's any justice, one day soon the devil will wake up in his Bel Air condo and find that he got more than he bargained for.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>A Right To Be Hostile (\u00a39.50) and Public Enemy #2: An All New Boondocks Collection (available in March 2005) are published by Three Rivers Press.

  "<p>Greg Rusedski missed out on reaching consecutive Russian finals when he lost 3-6 6-3 6-4 to Mikhail Youzhny in their semi-final at the St Petersburg Open. Rusedski was in control of the first set from the off, but was broken in the fourth game of the second set and Youzhny held on. The Russian had the momentum going into the final set and broke Rusedski in the third game before closing out the match. Rusedski felt that fourth game of the second set had been the turning point. 'At 15-30, I had a ball which looked good but got a very close call which was out, giving him two break points,' he said. 'I think it just changed the momentum of the match, but I still had chances after that. But I've had two good weeks [in St Petersburg and in Moscow] with the final and the semis.' Youzhny will play unseeded Karol Beck in today's final, the first of the Slovak's career. He beat Michael Llodra of France, the number seven seed, 6-4 2-6 6-1, in his first semi-final. Llodra had knocked out the top seed and crowd favourite Marat Safin in the quarter-finals and had been hoping to make his third final of the year. But although Beck showed his nerves in the second set, Llodra's serve failed in the third, allowing the 22-year-old to win in just under two hours. Andre Agassi has reached today's final of the Stockholm Open without dropping a set, but had to work hard to beat fourth seed Tommy Haas, of Germany, 7-6 7-6. Agassi will face Thomas Johansson, who beat fellow Swede Michael Ryderstedt 6-3 6-2. Agassi came back from 5-3 down in the first set to take it to a tiebreak, in which Haas took the first three points and led 5-2. But Agassi clawed his way back with some stunning defensive play, broke back to 5-4, held his serve, then clinched the tiebreak 7-5 with a passing shot. 'I just tried to stay alive out there,' Agassi said. The second set went with serve throughout, but the tiebreak was more one-sided, Agassi breaking to lead 2-1 and closing out the match 7-4.</p>",
  "<p>There are times as a reporter when you file your match report on a Saturday evening and hope your version of events still looks good on a Sunday morning. But it is worrying when match officials have the same approach to some of the big decisions they have to make. </p> <p>West Ham left Home Park with a point, but it might have been three had it not been for referee Andy Penn disallowing what looked like a perfectly legitimate 'goal' from Marlon Harewood in the 17th minute. </p> <p>His decision was prompted by a flag for offside from his assistant, Andrew Turner, who will be watching the highlights of this game today hoping it was correct. </p> <p>As Alan Pardew, West Ham's manager, said afterwards: 'He told me he couldn't wait to see it in the morning to see if he got it right, and I felt that affected his performance for the rest of the game. </p> <p>'We felt very aggrieved, as we felt we had a perfectly good goal disallowed. It was a stop-start kind of game and the officials did not help. Every time we got near their goal, there was an infringement.' </p> <p>Pardew's sense of frustration was also down to Plymouth's awkward style and gameplan, which allowed them to come back from behind and get a draw they ultimately deserved. </p> <p>Having won the Second Division last season, Argyle initially made a terrific start to life in the Championship, spending the first month of the season in the top four, after four wins in six games. </p> <p>A run of six defeats in the next 10, however, meant that they are now in mid-table and keen to avoid a descent of the table, so a point against promotion contenders West Ham is not to be sniffed at. </p> <p>Nevertheless, manager Bobby Williamson thought they should have had more than a point after his side created more clear-cut chances than their visitors. </p> <p>'We got one point, but I'm disappointed we didn't get more,' he said. 'West Ham scored with their first real effort on goal, and that was against the run of play.' </p> <p>Not strictly true, because the Hammers should have been ahead when Harewood converted Matty Etherington's left-wing cross, after 17 minutes of cat-and-mouse stuff. </p> <p>Nigel Reo-Coker flicked the ball just wide of the Plymouth post 10 minutes later, and Calum Davenport failed to find the net with a trio of headers from Etherington corners in quick succession. </p> <p>Argyle's strikers were no better, with Stevie Crawford shooting wide from close range in the 15th minute and then firing another shot high over the bar. Even worse followed two minutes before half-time when French midfielder David Friio completely missed the ball as Micky Evans cut it back from the by-line, and when West Ham swept upfield, they compounded his misery by scoring the opening goal. </p> <p>The ball was fed out to Bobby Zamora on the right wing, and when he crossed into the goalmouth, Steve Lomas put a glancing header past Romain Larrieu from close range. </p> <p>Zamora should have doubled West Ham's lead early in the second-half but ran into Larrieu with Harewood unmarked, and Etherington had a volley well saved. </p> <p>But Stephen Bywater at the opposite end was beginning to be tested by Argyle's players, tipping over headers from David Norris and Evans from close range. He was at fault with Plymouth's equaliser in the 76th minute, however, when he failed to hold a full-blooded 25-yard free-kick from Paul Wotton, who had been introduced as a substitute only moments earlier. </p> <p>With the smell of blood in their nostrils, Plymouth went for the killer blow, and Friio and Wotton were both denied. West Ham held on for a point, but will also be watching the highlights today to see if it really should have been three.</p>",
  "<p>Cometh the extra hour, cometh the Coleman. The clocks went back in the early hours this morning, and while his opposite number at Spurs doesn't seem to know what day it is, let alone what time, Fulham manager Chris Coleman had this crucial victory planned to the minute. </p> <p>On a barmy day in south-west London, goals from Luis Boa Morte and Andy Cole put an end to Fulham's recent losing streak of three in the League, lengthening that of Spurs to the same number in the process. </p> <p>'We were the better team today,' said Coleman. 'Our targets are what we can produce in 45 minutes. We've been playing two games in one and it's our inability to be consistent over the 90 minutes that has been one of the most frustrating things. But today we looked like we were back to our old selves.' </p> <p>Coleman has been highly critical of his team in public of late, but whatever he said to them in private before this match, it did the trick. At last, they maintained their dominance for the entire game. </p> <p>Fulham quickly established control of the midfield, enabling Steed Malbranque to design clever opportunities for the muscular and speedy Boa Morte and Collins John. </p> <p>Shortly after the half-hour, it brought the opening goal. Boa Morte flicked the ball out left to Malbranque, continued his run and dispatched the well-weighted return ball first-time into the bottom right-hand corner. </p> <p>Having scored the first, Boa Morte created the second on the hour. He teased a ball into Cole on the edge of the area. The Fulham captain returned it with a backheel before taking up position, unmarked, on the edge of the six-yard box to head Boa Morte's superb cross past Paul Robinson. </p> <p>Spurs, meanwhile, were desperately poor and showed no stomach for this local fight. They have now won just one of their past 17 London derbies. </p> <p>So desperate was Sean Davis to have a good game on his return to his former club, he tirelessly chased the ball around on fast-forward as if to a Benny Hill soundtrack. However, every time he got possession, he found it was met with the cry of 'Fulham reject' from the home crowd. 'What a waste of money!' they added, when he was substituted late on. </p> <p>But for one Jermain Defoe half-chance that flashed across the face of goal, Spurs produced little of note - aside from inspiring a cheeky cheer from the Fulham fans on the rare occasion that Mark Crossley, deputising in goal for the injured Edwin van der Sar, got a touch. </p> <p>Fulham might have made their victory more emphatic; Boa Morte collapsing in the area after Noe Pamarot had hacked at his flashing heels, and Robinson clawing away an attempted Cole chip. </p> <p>'My players were tired today,' conceded Spurs manager Jacques Santini. Fulham's players, at least, deserve their extra hour in bed this morning.</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United will this week request that the Football Association take the strongest possible disciplinary action against Arsenal striker Thierry Henry as the aftermath from last Sunday's explosive match at Old Trafford continues. </p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson's club will point to an incident during United's 2-0 win in which Fredrik Ljungberg and Henry were involved in a foul on United defender Gabriel Heinze. That incident, in which it is alleged Henry assaulted the Argentine while he lay on the ground, will form the centre piece of a dossier United will present to the FA relating to occurrences on and off the field at Old Trafford. </p> <p>To date, Ruud van Nistelrooy is the only man to have faced any FA sanction, having pleaded guilty to serious foul play for a challenge on Ashley Cole and having been issued with a three-match ban. However, Ferguson is angered by Arsenal's attitude towards the Dutchman and the manner in which his 'crime' was brought to the attention of the authorities and has demanded the FA treat any transgressions by Arsenal with the same vigour. </p> <p>'You should check how the Ruud van Nistelrooy tackle was bought to the attention of the FA,' said Ferguson. 'There is supposed to be a system to deal with issues like that, but in this case the compliance officer stepped in and I think that is because of the publicity. </p> <p>'If that is the case, who is deciding the discipline - the press, the FA, or the referees' committee? For instance, there was one outstanding incident in the game with Arsenal which is worse than Van Nistelrooy. We shall present that to the FA and see what they do. </p> <p>'Edu produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker, but this was worse than that. The tackle on Heinze was terrible. You get the video, you watch that. What Henry did? That was bad. </p> <p>'I don't understand why they target Ruud. I think they have a problem with him. I know Wenger had a chance to sign him. It could be that.' </p> <p>United's observations will also cover the events that took place outside the dressing rooms in which Ferguson is said to have been covered in pizza and soup thrown by the losing players. A hasty agreement last Sunday between the clubs had supposedly led to a 'vow of silence' over the incident, but United are angered by what they see as leaks from Arsenal about the affair. </p> <p>'We have undertaken our own investigation and we are compiling our own dossier for the FA about Arsenal's behaviour and we will give it to them and urge they act on it. We are not messing about,' said the United manager. </p> <p>The alleged leaking of information by Arsenal has added ill feeling to the feud between English football's two biggest clubs and Ferguson has possibly worsened relations with his observations on what he believes is ingrained ill discipline at the London club. </p> <p>'There is nothing wrong with Manchester United's discipline record,' he said. 'We have played Arsenal in the last two games, two important games, and they have had seven players booked and we have had three. There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. Phil Neville got booked for his first challenge. </p> <p>'I am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. We have always been good at being gracious in defeat. What happened on Sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, don't they?'</p>",
  "<p>Watching the tv scenes from Old Trafford last Sunday, I got a real sense of the tide turning against a decade of corporate football. Outside the ground, the backlash against the 'football plc' was unleashed as campaigners against the attempted takeover of Manchester United by Malcolm Glazer - who has no history of interest in the sport - spoke up for fans everywhere, in angrily rejecting that their 'club' bend to the brutal logic of the market. Inside it was fitting that a match hyped as 'the game of the decade' should be turned by a dive from a player whose transfer has intensified the unpleasant stink around the modern game. </p> <p>Football has always had a ruthless, commercial side. But, for Evertonians at least, Wayne Rooney's move was a watershed. Many of our supporters don't earn a great deal. They fill away ends week after week at great expense because they hold on to the belief that the legend 'Once a blue, always a blue' means exactly that. </p> <p>It hangs together - just - when this loyalty is seen to be reciprocated even to a small degree by players, manager and directors. But it all falls apart spectacularly when supporters get the sense that they are being laughed at by players and their parasitic agents. </p> <p>Rooney's move and the circumstances around it epitomise all that is wrong in a sport poisoned by an unseemly money culture. A curious sequence of events involving a 'surprise \u00a320million bid' for Rooney by Newcastle - whose chairman is close to Rooney's agent, Paul Stretford - led to Manchester United signing the English game's brightest talent in years for less than expected and Stretford earning \u00a31.5m before the August transfer window closed. However you look at those events, the damage to football cannot be denied. </p> <p>On Merseyside, young fans were left confused and let down. What happened to loyalty then? From now on, they will be that much more cynical about football and its machinations. This transfer also took \u00a31.5m out of football and tucked it in the pocket of one man. Can that be right when some of England's oldest football clubs are on their uppers? Also, the Rooney deal showed that the Premier League have a huge imbalance in power and finance, the semblance of an even competition having long since been shattered. Increasingly, the rich big three - Arsenal, United and Chelsea - are becoming a mini-league of their own. </p> <p>You might think that, somewhere in all this, there are grounds for an inquiry by the supposed guardian of the sport's good name. Sadly, the Football Association have long since run up the white flag on financial regulation. </p> <p>When they blessed the Premier League breakaway in 1992, the FA dressed it up as a bid to help the England team. In truth, it was about delivering the knockout punch in their century-long fight with the Football League. But the price was to give the big clubs their own way, even to the point where their representatives now sit around the governing body's top table. In other worlds, that situation would be a conflict of interests. </p> <p>Even within the Premier League there is no equality. The winners of the league earn twice as much from TV as the relegated clubs. Divisions between the big clubs and the rest grow wider every season. For how much longer will fans trek down the M6 to pay \u00a349 at Stamford Bridge for a poor view of an almost certain defeat? </p> <p>This bloated game is beginning to smell and even the non-footballing public are getting a whiff. They read about the symptoms of excess and do not like it. </p> <p>But, for all its ills, football can be fixed relatively easily. The big three will not like the solution - but that probably means that it is good for the rest of us. We need a return to more redistribution of resources, tighter regulation to prevent profiteering and fans taking more control of their clubs. </p> <p>The first two points fall to the football authorities. </p> <p>From professional football's origins in the late nineteenth century, the FA were always conscious that unbridled market forces would destroy the game. Over time, systems of revenue redistribution were developed, such as transfer fees, sharing of gates and, in more recent times, broadcasting fees. Coupled with this, there were rules to stop profiteering and the ransacking of clubs: directors could not be paid; grounds could not be sold for private profit. These systems served the sport and its supporters well for more than 100 years, creating a balanced competition where all fans could realistically nurture a dream of success. </p> <p>Such systems urgently need to be reintroduced. Even in the US, sport applies rigorous systems of redistribution to maintain competitive balance and 'uncertainty of outcome'. The rich teams do not always win and fans remain interested enough to pay for tickets and TV packages. </p> <p>Our own Premier League make decisions on a two-thirds majority. It is clearly in the interests of 14 clubs in the league to vote for a more even split of TV money across the league. The big three will inevitably threaten to walk off to a European Super League. It is time to call their bluff. Their fans, like those of the rest, want competitive domestic football. </p> <p>Regulation is the FA's job. In the wake of their long, hot summer, they are reviewing their structures and governance. We all need them to wake from their torpor, grab the game by the scruff of the neck and face down the vested interests. </p> <p>Is more regulation and redistribution likely to happen if football continues to behave as it does now? Probably not. That is why more supporter ownership is vital. It is the only one that fans can implement acting alone. Shareholders United struck a blow for all fans last week in helping to see off the Glazer bid. It is evidence that a supporters' trust, a not-for-profit mutual society, can wield real influence at Premier League level. </p> <p>This success coincided with the fourth annual conference of Supporters Direct, a government-funded initiative to help the development of supporters' trusts. In a little more than four years, 120 have formed, 60 with a substantial shareholding in their clubs and 40 with boardroom representation. Supporters' trusts control three Football League clubs. </p> <p>Football is in a depressing state, but there are signs of hope that, after a decade of corporate madness, supporters are dragging it back to where it began. </p> <p> Andy Burnham was special adviser on sport at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport from 1999 to 2001. He is the Labour MP for Leigh and chairman of Supporters Direct</p>",
  "<p>India unravelled in such spectacular fashion that even their greatest critics were forced to pause for a moment before spewing forth the bile and vitriol that follows every thumping defeat. </p> <p>In losing by 342 runs in the third Test against Australia and meekly surrendering an undefeated home series record that was so proudly held for 35 years, this team has attracted plenty of anger and disappointment from the man on the street and the media. But they do not deserve all of it. </p> <p>Rahul Dravid, standing in for Sourav Ganguly, is facing the wrath and few men deserve it less. The Board of Control for Cricket in India are a soft target in these situations, but rarely has bumbling incompetence and petty politicking cost so much. </p> <p>The first thing anyone would accept, including the India team, was that Australia were simply far superior. But, this does not absolve the Indians of all responsibility. </p> <p>The batting - traditionally India's strength - failed miserably; they were five down for 103 in the first innings and for 37 in the second. The middle-order, one of the best in the world on paper, was collectively out of form. There was a lack of positive intent, the seamers could not exploit a helpful pitch and, as one India cricketer put it 'when you beat the batsman, you also beat the keeper'. </p> <p>Parthiv Patel's temperament and grit with the bat are unquestionable and he is clearly a young man with a fine mind for the game. But he is not a wicketkeeper and failed to collect even straight balls from the fast bowlers. </p> <p>These are situations any cricket team could have faced when up against this all-conquering, ruthlessly efficient Australia team. But the Indians had to deal with so much else, you wondered how they could possibly be 100 per cent on the ball. 'To be competitive against teams like Australia you have to be at the top of your game, otherwise you will be blown away,' said Dravid. </p> <p>Well, here is how India went about being at the top of their game. On the eve of the Nagpur Test match, Ganguly told reporters that he was fit and looking forward to leading the team to victory and squaring the series. On the morning of the match, Dravid went out for the toss and the rumours began to surface. 'Was Ganguly ducking this match because he did not get the pitch he wanted?' asked the press. The speculation got so out of hand that Andrew Leipus, the India team's physiotherapist, was forced to put out a statement explaining that fluid in the hip joint was causing Ganguly pain. </p> <p>Meanwhile, it had become clear that Ganguly had called the president of the Vidarbha Cricket Association, Shashank Manohar, as early as 20 October and requested a pitch that would assist the spinners. In the first Test in Bangalore, India's spinners took 16 of the 20 wickets to fall, in the second they accounted for 18 out of 20. Was it not natural that Kishore Pradhan, the curator at Nagpur, would prepare a pitch that had something in it for the spinners? Apparently he knew better and left plenty of grass on the pitch. </p> <p>Barring Stephen Harmison and Shaun Pollock, the best seam bowlers in the world were in the Australia attack. Yet Manohar stated that his men would prepare whatever pitch they thought was best. Indian cricket is famous for working at cross-purposes, but this took the biscuit. </p> <p>You could see that the lift India got from the Chennai Test - where they were in a fine position to square the series needing 210 runs from the last day with ten wickets in hand - had been negated. Here were a team wondering why their own men were going out of their way to produce conditions that would help the opposition. </p> <p>'This is a very Australian wicket,' said Adam Gilchrist, with a wide smile plastered on his face, while one India cricketer fumed: 'When you go to Australia, do you think they try and slow down the strip at the WACA to make it more sporting for us?' </p> <p>That said, the India team did many things wrong. They axed Yuvraj Singh, a man considered indispensable not three Test matches ago. In Pakistan, they forced Aakash Chopra, who notched up four 100-run opening stands with Virender Sehwag, out of the team and found place for Yuvraj in the middle-order. Then, having tried Yuvraj as an opener in the second Test in Chennai - where he failed in the first innings and was unbeaten in the second when rain ended the match - he was dropped.This time, they brought back Chopra, his confidence having been thoroughly undermined. </p> <p>Of all India teams, this one has the greatest unity. It is not divided along zonal lines, as many of the past have been. The seniors are not arrogant and have respect for the abilities of fresh faces. </p> <p>But if the selectors keep chopping and changing when they should not, the cracks will begin to develop. And if you let John Buchanan and his players have the slightest glimpse of a crack, they will drive a wedge in and hammer it home relentlessly until you surrender abjectly, as the Indians did in Nagpur.</p>",
  "<p>The temptation at the Football Association must be huge (and no, we are not talking about Faria Alam). An idea has been mooted by the Premier League that they, consummate professionals of course, take over the running of the England team and the FA Cup. The FA must simply feel like giving up and saying: 'OK, you mess it up for a while.' Last one out of Soho Square, turn off the lights. </p> <p>The Baldrick of this cunning plan is Rupert Lowe, the Southampton chairman. As well as England and the Cup, the Premier League would administer the new Wembley Stadium, to maximise its revenue. The FA - who would be expected to provide the staff to administer all this - would be left to deal with rules, regulations and discipline. </p> <p>After a week such as this, the FA would probably gratefully hand over that, too. Burning issues, such as was it pea soup or tomato at Old Trafford, the Adrian Mutu affair and crowd trouble at Millwall and Chelsea have burdened further an organisation floundering without leadership. Now Manchester United want them to investigate the tunnel fracas. No wonder the Premier League want all the glamorous bits. </p> <p>And there is more besetting the FA: the fallout from failing to punish David Beckham, the silence that has followed the court case involving the agent Paul Stretford after the governing body said a fortnight ago that they were 'actively pursuing' the matter. This is without the less publicised work that goes on sorting out equally contentious rows lower down the game's food chain. </p> <p>The pressure had been turned up early in the week when the sports minister, Richard Caborn, stuck his Sheffield steel in. Concerned by the leniency shown to Beckham, he said that it was about time the FA sorted themselves out. He also recommended that Mutu be punished severely. </p> <p>Enter Lowe, a 'professional' representative on the FA's main board, with his 2,000-word treatise. It ended with: 'If we, as the FA, do not instigate a modernising process, then it is likely that change will be enforced on us by the imposition of a regulator from central government. Please remember this as you consider the future of the FA.' Look, Minister. We're doing what you want. </p> <p>The arrogance of the Premier League knows no bounds. For a start, they have a man presenting this document whose club may not be in the Premiership in six months and who may not be in his position much longer if a disaffected section of his club's support have their way. </p> <p>Under the guise of marketing ability, their real motive appears to be making more money. By running the England team, they will be in a good position to press for compensation for players. Revamping the Cup could mean more prize money to them, which has been happening over the past couple of years, rather than to the grass-roots clubs, whose need is greater. And Wembley? Wasn't there something last week about a casino going on that site with the proposed new, more relaxed gaming bill? </p> <p>We are already seeing the over-marketing and greed of the Premiership that is alienating spectators. Since highlighting falling attendances and rising prices in these pages last week, this department has been inundated with fans' stories of disillusion and weariness at being fleeced. </p> <p>This for a competition that is growing increasingly uncompetitive. Part of the problem at Old Trafford last weekend was that the significance of the match was so overblown due to it being one of only six matches during the season that count for so much. Perhaps the Premier League might address their own issues before assuming the FA's. </p> <p>The FA are by no means flawless. We see that daily. They acted swiftly and justly in banning Ruud van Nistelrooy for three matches, however. There they knew that they were on solid ground. They also feel hard done by over the Beckham case, citing the lack of a specific rule. </p> <p>It would be interesting to see the Premier League trying to sort that one out. They were, after all, relieved in the summer when the burden of suspending a player - such as Mutu - was taken from them and put in the hands of the FA. All sorts of vested interests come into play. Put simply, they would rather someone else did the dirty work. </p> <p>Sometimes, too, you feel for the FA. They announce an inquiry into the events at Millwall and Chelsea and are then pilloried for not taking a decision. This while the police are investigating. </p> <p>The fear in football has always been that the government will get involved, that there will be some kind of watchdog. Tony Blair's task force of 1997 recommended the idea, but the FA reassured the government that they were on the case. Of course, football does not want it. Its customs, practices and cosiness might be exposed. You can only wonder sometimes at what deals are done, what relationship exists, when four of the FA's 12-man main board are from the Premier League, half of the board from the professional game. </p> <p>In fact, the FA's chairman and chief executive, who also sit on the main board, should represent the independent regulator. It is what the FA are for and need to get back to. It is time to reassert their authority. The chairman, Geoff Thompson, can spend his time issuing statements about protocol for the restructuring of the organisation but had nothing to say on the raft of high-profile cases last week. Surely it is time for a statement of moral authority, at the least, a mission statement. </p> <p>Thompson informs us that Lowe is jumping the gun. The board will meet on Wednesday to consider appointing an independent chairman of the structural review. He hopes to have him - or her, perhaps - in place by the end of November. At that time, Lowe's document will be presented to the new figure. </p> <p>How long, then, before the report, before action is taken? They do not even appear to know whether they want a chief executive, wondering whether it is now an impossible job. </p> <p>Not for the right man or woman it is not. So far, some usual, ordinary names have been mentioned. The FA should forget meetings and reviews and fill their vacuum with a bold appointment - an independent figure of quality and authority, from outside football if necessary - that sends a message to Lowe and his mates, government and the game at all levels. And rather than diluting his or her power, give them more.</p>",
  "<p>With dust and cobwebs collecting in its aged wooden stand and lagging hanging off old pipes, Fratton Park remains a throwback to less sophisticated times, as readers reminded us in these pages recently. It is, though, a formidable ally to Portsmouth. I don't know what its crammed seats full of incessantly raucous support do to the enemy, but by God they frighten me. </p> <p>And yesterday, it seemed, Manchester United. For the second time in six months they were sunk on the South Coast by a vibrant Portsmouth side - you wait 47 years for a win over United and two come along at once - with David Unsworth this time slamming home a penalty and Yakubu Aiyegbeni grabbing his sixth league goal of the season. </p> <p>'Incredible result, especially with United coming here with near enough their strongest side,' beamed the Pompey manager Harry Redknapp. 'This place is a bit like the old Dell, isn't it? One of those tough places to go.' </p> <p>Thus did toothless United waste all the hard work in beating Arsenal last Sunday, and Sir Alex Ferguson was not mincing his words. 'It's a terrible disappointment, a real kick in the teeth,' he said. 'The result of last weekend has been absolutely destroyed. This was a bad, bad performance and an awful result.' Indeed, if this performance was soup, it would have been gazpacho; if pizza, the pavement variety. </p> <p>Most worrying for him must be United's inability, for all their possession, to unlock a defence, as they did regularly in their expansive dominance of the Premiership for most of a decade. Now Arsenal, despite the defeat last Sunday and the wobble yesterday, are leaving them behind, along with Chelsea. United now trail the leaders by nine points and there currently looks little prospect of overhauling them. </p> <p>'I'm not interested now in what happens at the top. I'm just interested in what we do,' added Ferguson, in what cannot be a concession of the title this early in the season, but was certainly an acknowledgement of his side's travails. </p> <p>It is not that United's record is poor. This was only their second defeat of the season, the last being at Chelsea on opening weekend. Too many games are drawn, too many players out of sorts, however. Cristiano Ronaldo is in that difficult second season, Ryan Giggs perhaps waning. Central midfield offers little ingenuity, strikers are reduced to long-range shots. Wayne Rooney's shock value stuttered. </p> <p>It began brightly enough for a side changed from the team who beat Arsenal only by Alan Smith replacing the suspended Ruud van Nistelrooy. Ronaldo was just wide with a low shot, then saw Shaka Hislop fumble another. The goalkeeper also had to go full-length to turn aside Paul Scholes's drive after Rooney had teed him up. United were moving into gear, aided by Pompey's too-deep defending. </p> <p>Gradually they got hold of the ball and a foothold in the game, however, Nigel Quashie getting through some manful and tidy work in midfield. They were forced to reshape due to an injury to Diamansy Kamara, but Ricardo Fuller provided new pep. He got to the byline and supplied Lomana Lua-Lua, Gary Neville kicking away the shot with Roy Carroll beaten. The goalkeeper also had to tip over Amdy Faye's drive. </p> <p>You sensed that Portsmouth needed to score in this purple patch, that a frustrated United would regroup at half-time. Indeed, just after the restart, when Quashie slipped to let in Ronaldo, who crossed for Scholes to drive wastefully straight at Hislop, it looked as if United were raising their game. </p> <p>Suddenly, though, Portsmouth were ahead. Aiyegbeni flicked the ball into the path of Fuller, who was brought down in the act of shooting by a combination of Gabriel Heinze and Rio Ferdinand. Unsworth duly drilled home the penalty. </p> <p>Now United were roused, the game becoming fiery as Rooney clashed with Faye, Smith with Portsmouth's substitute Val\u00e9ry Mezague. It seemed as if United must score when Ronaldo's header hit the bar and fell to Smith, but the ball somehow rebounded off him wide of a gaping goal. </p> <p>On came Roy Keane and Louis Saha to try to rescue the game. It soon needed some rescuing, with Portsmouth, amid a by now frenzied atmosphere, doubling their lead. A long punt upfield by Hislop was well controlled by Aiyegbeni, quick and strong. The Nigerian then turned Mikael Silvestre, held off Ferdinand and clipped a shot over Carroll, down too soon and able only to touch the ball into the net. </p> <p>Last week, United had beaten Arsenal with a contain-and-counter strategy. Now they had been done unto and never, thereafter, did they look like retrieving the position. Arjan De Zeeuw and Dejan Stefanovic held firm at the centre of a Pompey defence now bombarded with predictability. Fratton Park rocked as United rolled over.</p>",
  "<p>For a game that is reputedly decaying more dangerously than a condemned building, Scottish football continues to evince an unlikely vibrancy. Not all of the diverse elements in the crucible can be said to be positive - Berti Vogts and the national team and Celtic's dwindling interest in the Champions League are prime examples - but even its most heated detractors could not deny its capacity for engaging widespread attention. </p> <p>The departure of Craig Levein, a young coach of endless potential, from Hearts to Leicester City underlines a phenomenon that may be peculiar to Scotland. It is a country that seems unable to produce more than a couple of genuinely international-class players, but is capable of fathering quality managers in numbers that Sadlers Wells would be proud of. </p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes, Graeme Souness and, until his voluntary sabbatical, Gordon Strachan gave Scots control of 20 per cent of the clubs in the Premiership, an extraordinary figure. Levein's work under seemingly impossible financial restraints at Tynecastle and his ever-growing reputation among professionals suggest he is capable of taking Leicester back into the top division to fill the vacancy created by Strachan. </p> <p>Levein's virtually instant acceptance of the offer from the Midlands club would not be prompted by personal earnings, but by the strained atmosphere in which he was operating at Hearts. Supporters clamouring for the removal of chief executive Chris Robinson and vehemently opposing the latter's proposed move out of their present stadium was matched only by discord among the board. The arrival of the Lithuanian banker, Vladimir Romanov, as prospective buyer and of Anatoly Byshovets, the former manager of the CIS following the break-up of the Soviet Union, as the projected director of football, would also have contributed to Levein's uncertainty over his future. </p> <p>It is not unreasonable to suppose, either, that if Jimmy Calderwood sustains the astonishing improvement he has made to Aberdeen after only three months, he could be the next Scottish manager to attract the headhunters from the south. </p> <p>Aberdeen's 3-2 victory over Celtic in Glasgow in midweek may have been the result, in large measure, of miscalculations by the young Parkhead goalkeeper David Marshall, but the new dynamic Calderwood and his assistant, Jimmy Nicholl, have introduced to the club has been evident all season. </p> <p>The next stop for the Pittodrie circus is Ibrox this afternoon and, given the progress they have made in such a short time there is no reason to doubt they are also capable of damaging a Rangers team with whom they drew 0-0 on the opening day. </p> <p>Calderwood certainly has more cause for optimism at the moment than either Vogts or Martin O'Neill. The little German was expected to be relieved of his duties as national manager last Tuesday, but the widely-anticipated Scottish FA board meeting did not take place. </p> <p>This is merely a postponement of Vogts's official removal, which will be formalised when compensation negotiations are completed and the members of the board have some idea of the identity of his successor. Of the two paper favourites, Strachan has already been discounted as unsuitable by a majority, while there remain misgivings among a telling number of the selectors over Walter Smith, the former Rangers and Everton manager. </p> <p>O'Neill's difficulties have made him noticeably defensive recently in the face of media suggestions that Celtic have begun a potentially irreversible decline. The comments were prompted by the 3-0 defeat by Shakhtar Donetsk that has left them pointless in Group F of the Champions League and have been firmed up since the defeat by Aberdeen. </p> <p>The on-field setbacks have been shocking not merely for having taken place, but for the number of goals conceded by a previously redoubtable defence. </p> <p>With Shakhtar due at Celtic Park on Tuesday to begin the second half of the European programme, O'Neill has lost his most formidable player, Chris Sutton, to injury. It was not mere coincidence that Celtic surrendered the three goals in Donetsk after Sutton failed to reappear for the second half, or that they were in general disarray against Aberdeen after his injury-enforced departure in the 58th minute. Another striker, Henri Camara, has also been injured and O'Neill is hoping he, along with the influential Alan Thompson, will be ready for the match against the Ukrainians. </p> <p>The Celtic manager is invariably optimistic about his team's prospects - especially at home - but his edginess was betrayed when he was asked about the comments of Ciprian Marica, Shakhtar's young Romanian forward, after the match in Donetsk. Marica claimed Celtic were 'monsters' who had tried to kick him off the park. </p> <p>'It's pure and utter drivel,' said O'Neill. 'I heard their manager [Mircea Lucescu] say Marica was a better player than Wayne Rooney. Do me a favour. He might not be a bad player, but being kicked? It's complete claptrap. Maybe Marica will make me eat my words by coming here and scoring a hat-trick, but if he's better than Wayne Rooney at the moment, I'm coming back as a player.'</p>",
  "<p>Ian Poulter might just have to reassess his year if he wins the Volvo Masters in southern Spain today. The flamboyant Englishman might have to raise his previous mark of self-estimation from one out of 10 to somewhere around six or seven if he takes the \u00a3432,202 cheque. </p> <p>Poulter is tied for second along with Sergio Garcia on six under par after a two-under 69 yesterday. Scotland's Alastair Forsyth leads the field on nine under after a 67, the best score of the day. </p> <p>Poulter might be famous for the Union Jack plus fours he wore at The Open this year, but he is one of the most honest players on the circuit. Earlier in the week he gave himself the low mark because he has been winless so far this season. The one he gave himself is for the Ryder Cup. </p> <p>Poulter began the day two shots off Garcia's lead and it looked as if it was going to be a day when nothing happened, but he managed to come back from a 86-minute rain delay because of thunder to birdie two of the last three holes. </p> <p>'I didn't actually hit it that great on the last few holes but I managed to get a couple of birdies,' Poulter said. </p> <p>Valderrama isn't the sort of course that can be attacked, so it would not seem to suit Poulter's aggressive style. However, the Woburn professional has managed to control his assertive nature this week and finds himself just three shots off the lead. </p> <p>'I've had to rein back a little. I'm taking on the pins that I really want to, but I'm not going for the silly pins.' </p> <p>Forsyth was another who managed to come back from the rain delay and stamp his authority on the tournament, although it did take him a while to get going. The 28-year-old Scot was on eight under par when play was suspended and enjoyed a two-stroke lead over Garcia. </p> <p>Forsyth's lead grew to three strokes on the resumption of play when the Spaniard missed a six-foot par putt on the 13th. </p> <p>Forsyth started the day a stroke behind Garcia but soon overtook him when he made four birdies in seven holes from the 7th hole. Garcia, who survived a disqualification scare on Friday, could manage only to play the 18 holes in level par and found himself in arrears to the Scot. </p> <p>'The delay did not come at a good time for me to stop,' he said. 'I'd just holed a good putt on 13 so to get called in was disappointing.' </p> <p>Forsyth, whose only victory on tour is the 2002 Malaysian Open, bogeyed his first hole after the rain delay, failing to get up and down from short of the 14th green, but he birdied the 16th and 17th holes to bounce back. Now he's looking at the biggest day of his life. </p> <p>'I've certainly never led a tournament of this stature before. I was pretty nervous at the start of the day, and I will be nervous tomorrow but I'll take it in my stride. I can only try to play good, solid golf and if it's good enough, then so be it.' </p> <p>One player who will not win is Colin Montgomerie. The former seven-time European No 1 starts the day five strokes back, but has featured here this week for the amount of space his love life has been getting in the tabloids. </p> <p>Montgomerie, who divorced wife Eimear in September, was pictured with Spanish model Ines Sastre in Madrid last week and the tabloids have had a field day with their alleged love affair. Not that it seemed to be bothering the 41-year-old. He has been a good mood all week. </p> <p>'I'm happy in Madrid. Happy in Spain. I wonder why?' </p> <p>Less happy this week are the sponsors. For 16 years the Volvo Masters has been the finale to the European Tour. This elite field event is only open to the top 60 players on the European money list, and has no halfway cut and large prize money. </p> <p>However, six of Europe's elite are conspicuous by their absence. Ernie Els, Retief Goosen, Alex Cejka, Adam Scott, Peter Lonard and Fredrik Jacobson have not taken their place in the field. Jacobson's decision to play in the United States is the biggest slap in the face to the Swedish car company. He won the title last year and is the first player since the tournament began in 1988 not to defend the title. </p> <p>It is not what Volvo deserves, considering the millions the company has poured into European golf for more than a decade-and-a-half.</p>",
  "The bodies had been whisked away but the dried pool of blood covering the dirt-floor dead end of a twisting alley was a chilling sign of what happened here last week. <p>Residents in the National Fort district, which like most of Port-au-Prince's slums is a bastion of support for former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, gathered around the darkening blood the following day. Some, who were afraid to give their names, said policemen wearing black masks had shot and killed 12 people, then dragged their bodies away. At least three families have identified the bodies of relatives at the mortuary; others who have loved ones missing fear the worst.</p> <p>'The police officers will say that this was an operation against gangs. But we are all innocent,' said Eliphete Joseph, a young man in a blue basketball jersey who claimed to be a friend of several of those killed, his eyes red with grief as he stood in the shadow of a crumbling concrete staircase. 'The worst thing is that Aristide is now in exile far from here in South Africa, but we are in Haiti, and they are persecuting us only because we live in a poor neighbourhood.'</p> <p>A police spokesperson confirmed there had been a police raid at National Fort looking for gang leaders and that at least eight people were killed.</p> <p>The killings appear to be the latest example of what human rights groups describe as a campaign of repression against suspected supporters of Aristide, who was escorted out of the country on 29 February by US Marines. The US government said he resigned. Aristide says he was forced out in a US-backed coup.</p> <p>The current repression has led Haitian and international human rights observers to draw comparisons with the darkest days of the 1991-1994 military regime, and with the 1957-1986 dictatorship of Fran\u00e7ois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc'. The difference, they say, is that the current government has had the blessing of the international community.</p> <p>Neither the US nor the UN, which has a peacekeeping force here of more than 3,000 troops, has censured the abuses committed under the government of Prime Minister Gerard Latortue, who took power in March. 'When 20 to 30 people were getting killed a year there was a cas cade of condemnation pouring down on the Aristide government,' said Brian Concannon Jr, director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti. 'Now that as many as 20 to 30 are getting killed in a day, there is silence... It is an obvious double standard.'</p> <p>UN and government officials deny that security forces are murdering opponents. Observers concede it is difficult to record how many have been killed and by whom. There are many armed groups in Haiti, including gangs that support Aristide and others with shifting political allegiances. Meanwhile, heavily armed ex-members of the defunct military, a corrupt force disbanded by Aristide in 1995, swagger through the capital and control swaths of the countryside with tacit UN and government approval.</p> <p>What is clear is that in recent weeks the government has gone on the offensive against members of Aristide's Lavalas party, searching homes and arresting people without warrants. Jails are full of suspected dissidents who have never seen a judge or been charged. The most publicised case is that of Gerard Jean-Juste, a Catholic priest arrested on 13 October at a soup kitchen he runs for children. Justice Minister Bernard Gousse said on Thursday that Jean-Juste is suspected of hiding 'organisers of violence', and no warrant was required for his arrest. A long-time rights activist who set up an organisation in Florida to assist Haitian refugees, Jean-Juste was an Aristide supporter. He remains in the national penitentiary, where he has not seen a judge, say his lawyers.</p> <p>Less than two weeks earlier, police burst into a Port-au-Prince radio station and arrested three former Lavalas party legislators who had appeared on a programme criticising the government. Human rights groups say hundreds more lower-profile Aristide supporters have also been jailed. 'We fought to bring democracy to Haiti, but since this government took over, it's been a dictatorship,' said Mario Joseph, a lawyer who worked to bring past human rights abusers to justice under Aristide and is now representing 54 people he says are political prisoners.</p> <p>Gousse refused to grant The Observer permission to visit prisoners at the penitentiary, where only 21 of the nearly 1,000 inmates have been convicted of anything. The prison was emptied by armed groups led by former military officers after Aristide's departure, and Joseph believes the majority of the new prisoners are Lavalas members.</p> <p>Government and UN officials defend the crackdown as an attempt to end the violence that has left dozens dead in the past three weeks. They accuse Aristide supporters of killing police and trying to destabilise the Latortue administration.</p> <p>'What we have seen in this country during the last month or two has been a resurgence of brutal violence organised probably to provoke a process of political destabilisation,' said Juan Gabriel Valdes, who heads the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (Minustah). 'Any state has the right to defend itself. We were sent by the United Nations to help and assist a government, and this task was given to us by the security council of the United Nations.'</p> <p>Evidence of such 'destabilisation' is scant. Shootings and robberies have become common in central Port-au-Prince, but it is not always clear whether they are politically motivated or the result of crime sparked by desperate economic conditions and an ineffectual police force. Gousse said he knew of only two lootings, and that police officers had only been killed while carrying out raids in slums.</p> <p>In recent weeks, media attention has focused on the killing and decapitation of two policemen, described as part of 'Operation Baghdad'. But the government has presented no evidence that the decapitations were carried out by Aristide supporters, nor that any such operation exists. According to Guyler C. Delva, head of the Haitian Journalists Association, the term 'Operation Baghdad' was coined by Latortue.</p> <p>Aristide's backers have suffered the brunt of human rights violations since the change in government, said Gerardo Ducos, who is leading an observation mission for Amnesty International. 'They are persecuting the Aristide people because they are afraid of them,' said lawyer Reynold Georges, leader of a party opposed to Aristide, who is representing Jean-Juste and several other jailed Lavalas party members. 'A lot of people have stayed loyal to Lavalas. Believe it or not, it's true. The poor people, the masses, still believe in Aristide.'</p>",
  "<p>In aerospace, big is often beautiful. Witness the construction of the world's biggest airliner in the largest factory in Europe by pan- continental Airbus, itself now the largest maker of passenger planes in the world. </p> <p>But the same doesn't hold true for the company that makes engines to power many of those planes: Rolls-Royce. Last week the ribbon was cut on the company's latest factory, a modern structure outside Glasgow of some 50,000 square feet with clean lines, a swooping roof and a gleaming exterior. That may not sound small, but compared with Hillington, the sprawling, 60-year-old 80,000 square metre factory that it replaces, it is. </p> <p>Hillington wears its industrial heart on its sleeve, built in rows of serrated-roofed, concrete blocks and opened as a reserve factory to make Merlin engines for the war effort. At is peak it turned out 400 of the legendary engines that powered Spitfires and Hurricanes in the Battle of Britain and beyond a month. Now most of its workshops lie damp and empty. Half the workforce has decamped to Inchinnan, and Hillington's white facades are crumbling. </p> <p>From the outside, Inchinnan could be anything- an airport terminal, a semi conductor plant, a factory making plastic crates. Inside, however, there is \u00a330m worth of equipment - forges, dies, cutters - making some 1 million airfoils (the blades that compress air at the heart of a jet engine) every year. </p> <p>Those inside appear proud of the new facilities. The factory is divided into operations making rotors (the moving blades that push air through jet engines, compressing it to 40 times normal atmospheric pressure), the stators (non-moving blades that guide it through) and seals. </p> <p>Each area is sub-divided into cells, working from those forging the rotor and stator blades from titanium and nickel alloy in 1,800C furnaces the size of small pizza ovens to cutters and machinists finishing the blades. </p> <p>Employees say there is some sadness at closing a proud and historic chapter so ruthlessly as is being done at Hillington. But sentiment has had little place in the aerospace industry since 11 September 2001. Inchinnan has been vital to Rolls's attempts to reshape itself since it announced a restructuring in 2000 intended to convert the growth in sales of its Trent family of engines into share price growth for investors sick of profits warnings and undershot targets. </p> <p>The 'reshaping' has absorbed the company since the Nineties, when Trent won it market share against GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US (it has leapfrogged Pratt into second place). But while sales have been good, productivity has lagged. Meanwhile, the terrorist attacks have made it all more urgent. </p> <p>John Cheffins, the owlish chief operating officer of Rolls-Royce, makes clear the threat that was posed by 9/11. 'We made 500 engines a year in the early Nineties,' he says. 'We purchased Allison [the US maker of mid-sized engines] in 1995 and saw terrific growth up until 2001 [at its peak, Rolls sold 1,362 engines]. As a result of the terrorist atrocities, the volume of engine sales went down by 40 per cent.' </p> <p>Rolls had plants around the world graded up to make 1,500 engines a year - two in the US, its UK operations in Derby, where engines are finally assembled, Bristol, the north east and Scotland, one each in Spain, Italy, Germany and Israel and operations in China - but suddenly it could only achieve 770 sales. </p> <p>Before 2000, the main works in Derby were overhauled. In 2001 the programme to deliver new facilities was speeded up and it started in earnest in 2003, with the beginning of the transfer from Hillington to Inchinnan. In May this year the rebuilding of four plants in the UK and one in Indianapolis in the US was announced. In total, Rolls will invest some \u00a3230m in its UK plants. </p> <p>The improvements that have been delivered at Inchinnan are beginning to convince investors. Now what took a fortnight at Hillington takes a day. With a third fewer employees (just under 1,000), Inchinnan not only reduced size, it increased efficiency. Along with the well-publicised cuts in its workforce (a net reduction of 8,000 people group-wide), Rolls has looked to improve the output of what remained. </p> <p>At Inchinnan relocation allowed negotiations over working practices, resulting in a five-day, three-shift system, with target-related bonuses replacing paid overtime. Inchinnan was one of 12 sites considered by Rolls for its compression systems manufacturing. Against this background, the unions, Amicus and the Transport &amp; General Workers, agreed. </p> <p>Mike Lloyd, the director of Rolls's gas turbine operations, says he expects the company to be able to deliver the same in 60 per cent of the space. At the same time, Cheffins says the company aims to buy in three-quarters of the parts that go into Rolls's turbine-driven engines (the current figure is 71 per cent), while Rolls focuses on 'technology-critical' areas such as making high-value spares and critical processes. Productivity has improved some 30 per cent over Hillington. </p> <p>The outcome, if it goes right, is a virtuous cycle where labour and overheads come down, productivity rises and, eventually, volumes recover. The company's target is to increase the margins on its products from the current 6 to 10 per cent 'in the medium term'. </p> <p>It is not all glitch-free, however. There is a nervousness about the performance charts posted around the factory being analysed too carefully by outsiders. One at a rotor cell showed lead time, cost and targets being missed. </p> <p>Cheffins recognises the sensitivities of the workforce to the new working arrangements. He admits there was suspicion about the ending of overtime payments, particularly when the first six-month target was not hit. But he says trust was restored when the workforce hit the second six-month period and it became clear how incentives were aligned between management and workforce. </p> <p>He points out that Rolls chose Scotland because of the workforce. The other shortlisted country, the Czech Republic, had certain cost advantages, but they were often less clear-cut on closer inspection. For example, where workforce skills approached those in the UK, the differentials in labour costs were not marked. </p> <p>In theory, similar output with lower cost - there has been a 5 per cent reduction this year, and the same is expected next - should see Rolls perform markedly better when it gets back to its production peak. Analysts say this could be in 2006, when Boeing and Airbus are aiming to produce 800 airplanes between them for the first time since 2001. </p> <p>But there are two caveats. First, the mix of engines has changed, so the two periods may not be directly comparable. Second, as Cheffins points out, there is the question of competition and price, as GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney continue to fight back against the market share that Rolls has built up. </p> <p>Indeed, although Rolls has 44 per cent of orders this year, airlines and planemakers both say that the pressure on prices is likely to remain intense. Rolls is known for being conservative - some would say buttoned-up. Certainly it won't make 'forward-looking statements' that would make people think the jam that has been endlessly postponed may finally be on the table in 2006. </p> <p>However, if they are allowed to say so quietly and with caution, some at the top of this engineering institution occasionally allow themselves to admit that things may be looking rather good by then. If so, Inchinnan, will have played a vital part in showing the way.</p>",
  "<p>When Eliot Spitzer became New York's attorney-general six years ago, few expected much of him or from the office he won control of only after a Florida-style recount and expenditure of a good deal of his father's money. </p> <p>Nowadays, nobody is in doubt what the 45-year-old prosecutor stands for. With swagger and arrogance, he has single-handedly taken the good fight to Wall Street - and won.

Earlier this year, he tangled with former New York Stock Exchange chief Richard Grasso over his $200 million 'golden parachute' and in June took aim at GlaxoSmithKline, saying it withheld safety data on its anti-depressant for children. </p> <p>Last month he clashed with Marsh &amp; McLennan, America's largest insurance firm, threatened to investigate the music industry for the decades-old practice of payola, and won a pay rise for the toilet attendants at New York's fanciest restaurants. </p> <p>Like many New York prosecutors before him (including a certain Rudy Giuliani), he had made a name for himself prosecuting Mafia dons. But by the early Nineties, Mafiosi were comparatively soft targets - good for crime-fighting publicity, but more of a nuisance than a worthy adversary for a young man whose jaw, the New York Times wrote, 'actually juts'. </p> <p>But Spitzer's technique is not to put the cuffs on executives, but to threaten their firms with financial ruin. His forebears, such as Giuliani, liked to try cases; Spitzer likes to settle. Indeed, such is his reputation that the announcement of a Spitzer investigation is an excuse to sell and an invitation for shareholder lawsuits and proxy campaigns. </p> <p>During last year's mutual fund scandal he said he was not shy of imposing the 'death penalty' - bringing charges even if it meant driving them out of business. 'Where there's recidivism, whether it's a robbery or a street crime, there will be no second chance,' Spitzer said. 'That may mean the death penalty for them. In my view that's the only option we are now left with.' </p> <p>As a result, firms almost invariably agree to punishment, remedy, and structural change rather than suffer the consequences. In the case of the recent insurance fraud investigation, the stocks of the biggest players implicated, Marsh &amp; McLennan and AIG, have lost a combined $38 billion in market capitalisation since the investigation was announced on 14 October. </p> <p>Indeed, it's come to the point that firms would rather settle than be probed, let alone prosecuted. Marsh &amp; McLen nan is a case in point. When Spitzer asked the firm about its practice of receiving 'contingent commissions' from insurance companies, Marsh apparently denied the practice (Spitzer called the fees 'kickbacks') and, according to the attorney-general, 'fed us the same foolishness they've been feeding the public over the years'. </p> <p>According to Spitzer, roughly $800m of the $1.5bn in net income Marsh earned last year came from those commissions. Alleged wrongdoing is one thing, but stonewalling Spitzer is another. He vowed he would not negotiate with the existing management and last week forced the resignation of Marsh CEO Jeffrey Greenberg, son of Hank Greenberg, the legendary boss of insurance giant American International Group (AIG). </p> <p>Along with a rumoured $500m settlement (Spitzer's office says it will be far higher), Spitzer has effectively replaced Greenberg with one of his own - Michael Cherkasky, head of Kroll, Marsh's corporate security and investigations unit, and formerly Spitzer's boss at the Manhattan district attorney's office. </p> <p>Though few will say it for fear of becoming a target, there is growing criticism that Spitzer is using his power to prosecute corporate malfeasance to further his political ambitions. If true, he would not be the first. From Theodore Roosevelt, who served as New York City police commissioner, to Giuliani, who used his crime-fighting credentials to win the New York City mayoral race, and presidential contender John Kerry, being a prosecutor is a way up the ladder. </p> <p>For all the attention he enjoys (he was Time ' s Crusader of the Year in 2002, and was among New York magazine's '50 Sexiest New Yorkers') there is broader criticism that he abuses his prosecutorial tools. And he has clearly rubbed up people with powerful friends in Washington the wrong way. </p> <p>Last year, he won a ruling that forced the Bush Administration to reverse its rollback of pollution regulations that applied to big utilities. The White House has urged Spitzer to be more supportive of American industry, saying his efforts - particularly over pollution - are counter-productive. But Spitzer says he took on the issue for the same reasons he took on Wall Street - because government wasn't doing it. 'They've tried to handcuff us.' </p> <p>But it looks as if one man is ready to fight back - former NYSE chief Richard Grasso. Spitzer wants Grasso to return $140m in compensation he received when he left the stock exchange; Grasso, with only his personal fortune to protect, accuses Spitzer of getting involved for personal gain, saying it's 'clear that Mr Spitzer is running for governor in 2006 and running hard'. </p> <p>Spitzer is unrepentant: 'I like it when people push back. It's what I would do.' </p> <p>But the Grasso compensation dispute speaks to a larger issue - that of executive compensation and the question of how much a CEO is worth. In other words, Spitzer is taking on the incestuous, clubby world of compensation committees that reward themselves and each other and keep driving chief executive pay higher. 'The nature of CEO compensation is something that deserves additional scrutiny,' he says. 'One of the things that will emerge from the Grasso investigation is the failure of compensation committees to fulfil their obligations.' </p> <p>Of all Spitzer's crusades, the Grasso case may be the one to make his peers on Wall Street most uncomfortable because he is, after all, one of them: a well-educated, well-connected, monied New Yorker. His father made a fortune in property. As a midfield football player at school, his job was to nobble the competition's star player ('He was kind of our secret weapon,' recalls team mate Calvin McGee. 'Very intense on the field - a tough guy to get around'). </p> <p>He attended Princeton and Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review . He worked as a junior clerk, then for the Manhattan District Attorney. In 1994, as a first-time candidate, he ran a disappointing fourth (out of four) for attorney- general. He ran again in 1998 and won. </p> <p>As is often pointed out, he knows who he's prosecuting because he's always known them. 'If he is waging class warfare,' notes commentator Daniel Gross, 'it's against his own class.' </p> <p>Where Spitzer will venture next is anyone's guess. There's plenty of corporate malfeasance, personal greed and social inequity in New York, let alone America, left to prosecute. </p> <p>He doesn't like to compare himself to Roosevelt or even Giuliani. 'But,' he said, 'you look at someone who played a role you'd like to emulate and look at the ideology they brought to government and say, yes, they understood what to do.' </p> <p>And he has made it clear he's not leaving soon. He's acknowledged that he is thinking about running for governor and the allure of a slower life. But, he says: 'I can't see getting out of the fray.' </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Name </strong> Eliot Spitzer </p> <p><strong> Age </strong> 45 </p> <p><strong> Job </strong> Became New York's 63rd attorney-general in January 1999</p> <p><strong>Major achievements </strong> Taking on securities analysts, investment bankers, mutual fund managers and insurance brokers, and improving environmental standards</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Princeton University and Harvard Law School </p> <p><strong> Family </strong> Lives with wife, Silda, in Manhattan with their three daughters.

  "<p>Five of the world's top 10 biggest and most profitable law firms are British, according to a survey by The Lawyer magazine. </p> <p>Clifford Chance, based in Canary Wharf, in London's Docklands, came top of the poll, with an estimated total revenue of \u00a3950 million last year. </p> <p>The firm employs more than 2,500 lawyers worldwide, including 626 partners, who each earned an average of more than \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>Skadden Arps, a US firm, comes second, with a turnover of \u00a3814m, followed by the City of London firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, on \u00a3785m. </p> <p>Freshfields hit the headlines earlier this year when the High Court blocked it from advising retail entrepreneur Philip Green on his attempted takeover of Marks &amp; Spencer owing to a potential conflict of interest. </p> <p>Linklaters and Allen &amp; Overy, both with about 2,000 lawyers, were respectively the fourth and sixth highest-earning firms. </p> <p>Slaughter &amp; May, another City stalwart, came only 49th, owing to its relatively small staff, but it remains probably the best-paid place for solicitors in London to work, with partners earning \u00a3778,000 a year on average. </p> <p>Catrin Griffiths, editor of The Lawyer, ascribed the global success of British firms to 'being prolific exporters of legal services'. </p> <p>The magazine's survey is to be published tomorrow, and has been conducted in conjunction with another magazine, The American Lawyer . </p> <p>Its findings are sure to add to concerns about the vast sums City firms are billing their clients.</p>",
  "With her 'Anyone But Bush' badge pinned firmly to her jumper, the young aide chatting indignantly about hanging chads over lunch in the Commons could be mistaken for a New Labour footsoldier. <p>But she is a Tory, and the craze for anti-Republican memorabilia sweeping Conservative circles is a sign of the way the US presidential race has turned British politics upside down. As all three parties try to gauge which way the wind is blowing, young Tories may be flirting with Kerry but Labour is struggling to put a brave face on the prospect of four more years of Bush's war on terror. </p> <p>One minister accuses the Democrats of an 'emotional spasm' of anti-Bushism. 'The great imponderable is what is a \"Bush Two\" presidency like?' he said. </p> <p>'He doesn't have to get re-elected; he has got his place in history; he's won a second election which his dad didn't do. He can start to really move,' he said. </p> <p>Such views will infuriate Labour MPs praying for a Kerry victory. Peter Hain, the Leader of the Commons, and Gordon Brown have forged links with the Democrats. </p> <p>However, the minister said the left's expectations were far beyond what a Democrat presidency would deliver: 'He'd have to show he's as tough a commander-in-chief as Bush was, so he's not going to blink on Iraq. He'd have swept up an awful lot of the Jewish pro-Israel vote, so he's not going to be able to deliver on putting pressure on [Israeli PM Ariel] Sharon.' </p> <p>Diplomats here know a President Kerry would be no more likely than Bush to sign up to the Kyoto treaty, submit to the International Criminal Court or shut down Guant\u00e1namo Bay, but most expect him to finesse disagreements with Europe more sensitively. And he is not so loathed by British voters that Blair's ratings plunge after appearing with him. Sunder Katwala, general secretary of the Labour grassroots thinktank, the Fabian Society, said the left should be realistic about what concessions Kerry would want from Europe to deliver the more consensual foreign policy the left wants. </p> <p>'We're all sitting about saying \"wouldn't it be exciting if John Kerry won, what would Kerry do for us?\" Actually he would have done quite enough for us by not being George Bush,' he said. </p> <p>A Kerry presidency could bring small but important changes appealing to British public opinion: concessions on climate change, funding for birth control and sexual health programmes in developing countries and a less hostile approach to the EU. </p> <p>The Blair government has hoped for the best but planned for the worst. </p> <p>'My heart says Kerry to win, but my head says Bush,' says one minister. Another suggests this may be Kerry's equivalent of Britain's 1992 campaign, with voters angry but still unwilling to take a risk on a new leader. </p> <p>A re-elected Bush would certainly have a mandate for pre-emptive military action across the world - and would probably have lost his most doveish influence, Colin Powell, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw's best ally, who is unlikely to serve again. </p> <p>But Blair hinted that a re-elected Bush would restart the Middle East peace process. </p> <p>There is surprisingly little difference between Kerry and Bush on the most difficult issue facing the coalition: Iran's nuclear ambitions. </p> <p>Downing Street's nightmare is having to condone US-endorsed military strikes on Iranian plants. </p> <p>Nor would there be much change on Iraq under Kerry, although his rhetoric would be different. The controversial offensive on Falluja would be already under way and his plan to demand troops from France, Germany and Spain would probably be rejected, leaving Britain and the US still shouldering the military burden.</p>",
  "By the time Yasser Arafat arrived for treatment in France, he was no longer able to put a brave face on his suffering for the benefit of the cameras. <p>Still conscious but too fragile to walk, the Palestinian leader was lifted from an military helicopter on a stretcher and wheeled into one of the France's leading hospitals for immediate blood tests. </p> <p>The Percy army teaching hospital in the suburb of Clamart, south west of Paris, has no VIP suites. Instead Mr Arafat spent his first night away from the compound that has been his prison for the past three years in a simple, one-bed ward. </p> <p>He was said to be exhausted but relieved to be finally receiving proper medical attention, after enduring prolonged ill health in the unhealthy conditions of his Ramallah home. </p> <p>A handful of supporters armed with Palestinian flags and flowers stood outside the barricades set up in front of the hospital to show solidarity with Mr Arafat, watched on by the armed police standing on the roof and officers with sniffer dogs patrolling the perimeter. </p> <p>Doctors at the hospital have all been trained by the military, and like Mr Arafat, are accustomed to war zones. The centre specialises in blood disorders and trauma, but the precise nature of his illness remained a mystery last night. </p> <p>Leila Shahid, the Palestinian Authority's envoy to Paris, said doctors would need several days before they were able to make a proper diagnosis.. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's journey to seek medical care began after dawn yesterday, when a helicopter carried him from his compound. As it left, many Palestinians were left wondering whether the only leader they have known would be returning. </p> <p>Some could draw comfort from the fact that Mr Arafat was going to Paris at all, which he presumably would not be doing if there was no hope of saving him. </p> <p>But the frail appearance of the Palestinian leader did little to dispell their concerns. </p> <p>Mr Arafat was accompanied by his wife, Suha, 42, who had rushed to his side from Paris. </p> <p>His departure, subdued and melancholy, stood in sharp contrast to his triumphant arrival in the occupied territories a decade ago which many Palestinians believed heralded the imminent promise of statehood. </p> <p>Israel has guaranteed Mr Arafat can return to Ramallah after a long-standing ban on him leaving his compound, the muqata. But Israel's justice minister, Yosef Lapid, told Army radio he doubted Mr Arafat would ever lead his people again. \"From everything I know, the chance that he will return ... to his previous post, that he will be the key person, almost non-existent.\" </p> <p>As the helicopter which was to carry Mr Arafat to Jordan for his flight to Paris descended through morning mist, a procession of soldiers and Palestinian dignitaries emerged from the barriers surrounding what remains of the muqata since the Israeli army tore into it in 2002. </p> <p>A black Mercedes and an ambulance drove towards the helicopter with a group of young men running alongside, chanting: \"With our blood, with our souls, we will sacrifice for you, Arafat.\" </p> <p>The chanting intensified as Mr Arafat was lifted from the car wearing a black overcoat and a large fur hat which slipped over his eyes. He blew kisses to his supporters. </p> <p>In the commotion, one of his closest aides, Munib al Masri, fainted and was taken away in an ambulance. </p> <p>Just after 7am, the helicopters moved off to the south, taking Mr Arafat from what has been his prison for 30 months. Outside the compound, about 100 wellwishers waved at the departing helicopter. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's mother-in-law, Ramonda Tawil, emerged from the muqata in tears. \"He is our spiritual father as well as our revolutionary leader,\" she said. \"He suffered for the last three years in that small room, without oxygen. We all hope he will come back quickly.\"</p>",
  "<b>Dear Andrew</b> <br> I hope that \"Back to church Sunday\" goes well, though I won't be joining the churchgoers. I know that there are people who find support and comfort in religion, but I don't, and I doubt whether society as a whole has much need of religion either. <p>There are countless examples of religious societies that are hostile to change and to science, misogynistic and intolerant of difference - to the point of violence. And even in constitutionally secular states like the USA, fundamentalist Christians seem to have a worrying amount of influence over government policy at home and abroad.</p> <p>British society, on the other hand, is fairly irreligious, and I'm glad of that. I think it helps to make our culture more tolerant and open, even though we are not yet a secular state and vestiges of religious privilege and influence remain. A pluralist society like ours shouldn't favour any one religion - or religion over atheism or humanism.</p> <p>Of course, individuals and societies need hopes and values to live by, but for many of us these will not be religious, and there is no going back to the piety and conformity of the past (if indeed they ever really existed). Modern societies need to recognise that.<br> <b>Best wishes, Marilyn</b></p> <p><b>Dear Marilyn</b><br> I'm weary this evening, my bones are aching. I've been doing jury service. Gazing fixedly into a world, it seems, quite without faith, or hope, or any sense of the sacred at all.</p> <p>Does society need religion? No, indeed. We moderns, in our wisdom, have found other ways of holding things together: consumerism, sport, celebrity gossip, party politics. And yes, I thank God that we no longer think we depend upon religion for social cement.</p> <p>Because that means that now, as never before, religion is set free to do its real job - of vindicating truthfulness. We jurors swore an oath to be conscientiously fair. Most of us did so on the New Testament. This, I think, represents what true religion is all about: a commitment to just such conscientiousness about truth, in life generally. Of course, I'm not for one moment suggesting that purely secular \"affirmations\" are any less sincere. Only, what I value is the extra poetic oomph that religion potentially gives, in this regard.</p> <p>Religious fundamentalists, secular fundamentalists: both mostly talk about the same \"God\", for and against. And both no doubt offer comfort, the comfort of a rigid self-certainty. But true religion, as I understand it, has a rather different God in mind. A God who, on the contrary, only takes away such comfort. Makes life more difficult. Confronts us with truthfulness, precisely, as an infinite demand.<br> <b>All the best, Andrew</b></p> <p><b>Dear Andrew</b><br> Jury service must be sorely trying, but perhaps your faith in humanity will be restored when you and your fellow jurors engage in conscientiously seeking truth, fairness, and justice - as most juries do, I believe. Life after religion is not all crime, sex, football and shopping, as religious pessimists often seem to think. Most of us know that a good life depends on various permutations of friends, family, meaningful activity, nature, art, poetry, music ... and trying to leave the world a bit better than one found it. Even the party politics you despise, though it can be trivial and dirty business, is often motivated by a desire to improve society.</p> <p>I'm probably just as interested in and committed to truth as you are, though I find it outside a religious framework. I am by no means as certain about everything as you imply, but I don't find it difficult to live with a few \"don't knows\" in my life. I don't know how life on Earth started (and neither does anyone else at the moment), and I don't know for sure what will happen to me when I die (and probably never will), but I don't find the religious answers at all convincing or helpful, even the more liberal ones that talk in terms of metaphor and religion being a human construct.</p> <p>So I just try to live life as well as I can without supernatural support. I wouldn't say that life as a thoughtful humanist is particularly easy - the obligation to think things through for oneself can be irksome, and any commitment to moral values, whatever they are founded on, can easily produce a state of impotent fury and misery, faced with the suffering and horrors we see every day in the news. I just have to keep telling myself that the world is not full of terrorists who kill children and saw off hostages' heads, and that ordinary goodness and moderation rarely make it into the media.<br> <b>Best wishes, Marilyn</b></p> <p><b>Dear Marilyn</b><br> Thanks for the concern. But let me assure you, my faith in humanity has never been in doubt! It's just that, as a Christian priest, I identify it with faith in God incarnate. </p> <p>And then, if I may say so, I do feel slightly patronised by your evident assumption that the one and only possible source of such faith is a craving for - as you put it - \"supernatural support\". I'm really just asking you to acknowledge the possibility, at least, that there might be other forms of religiousness. Ones that are, on the contrary, all about knocking away the false \"supports\" of conventional prejudice.</p> <p>Of course, that you're a public spokesperson for Humanism immediately tells me you're a serious lover of Truth. And if only all serious lovers of Truth could be allies! But I know you won't allow it. You Humanists have converted your lack of feel for religion into such a dogma, such a distraction.</p> <p>I don't at all \"despise\" party politics, by the way. God forbid! I have a real admiration for party politicians' thick-skinnedness. What troubles me, though, is when people deal with religion as if it were something like party politics, a matter for propaganda. Let's argue, certainly. But propaganda's something else. I'm personally just as allergic to propaganda for religion as I am to propaganda against it. In a culture saturated with propaganda, I go to church looking for the very purest opposite. (And just occasionally do find it.)<br> <b>All the best, Andrew</b></p> <p><b>Dear Andrew</b><br> Whenever I say negative things about religion I'm told off for being dogmatic, and whenever I say something even the slightest bit nice, I'm told I'm being patronising - so apologies in advance for whatever it is I'm being today.</p> <p>I didn't mean to imply that the only reason for believing is a craving for supernatural support, but it is surely one of the reasons - and one of the things that will get people into churches on Sunday. And I know that religiousness takes many forms - it is really only the more dogmatic, authoritarian and power-hungry ones that I fear. Like most humanists, I am happy to set aside differences of belief and motivation and work with anyone for a good cause (and some of my best friends are religious!).</p> <p>But also, like most humanists, I don't expect any particular privileges for my world view or any social status or power to come with it. In that I think we differ from some religions (not all, of course). Religious leaders still seem to expect the rest of us to defer to their opinions, and sometimes even (for example, the two archbishops on the assisted dying for the terminally ill bill) claim to speak for us, or to want to educate us. That's why humanists like me would prefer religion to be a private matter, and the search for truth and a good society to be carried out on a level playing field.</p> <p>When I want to escape life's stresses and \"propaganda\" I listen to music or go for a walk. This Sunday, weather permitting, I'll be halfway up a mountain - church does it for you, nature does it for me.<br> <b>Best wishes, Marilyn</b></p> <p><b>Dear Marilyn</b><br> Yes, but there you go again!</p> <p>I don't go to church to \"escape life's stresses and propaganda\", as you put it. You're still automatically assuming all we religious folk are essentially escapists. But I don't want to escape the prevailing propaganda-culture - I want to resist it.</p> <p>The disease, the cult of Mammon, thrives on the ever-increasing atomistic individualism of our society. Resistance requires effective structures of solidarity, imaginatively rich community, serious traditions of enlightened authority. All the things that church life, for instance, is meant to provide. Going for long walks (as I also do) simply isn't enough.</p> <p>I don't want the churches to have unfair privileges any more than you do. I just want to help keep alive a certain quite seriously endangered intensity of resistant hope.<br> <b>All the best, Andrew</b></p> <p><b>Dear Andrew</b><br> I too want to resist a lot of what I see around me - war, complacency, inequality, the vilification of asylum seekers - though I want to celebrate some (perhaps endangered) things as well. A recent evening at London's Conway Hall celebrated 75 years of free speech. But what really engaged the speakers - Polly Toynbee, Richard Dawkins, Barbara Smoker and Martin Rowson - and the audience were the threats to that freedom in the proposals for a new law against incitement to religious hatred. Any such law would have to be very carefully framed - individuals may need protection against hatred, but we must remain free to criticise religious beliefs. Why, when all other ideas are up for criticism, evaluation, revision, change, should religious ones be different and given special protection? It seems to people like me yet another example of religion intruding into the public domain, claiming more than its due and trying to shut down dissent.</p> <p>I read a news story about a woman in Italy killed by a falling crucifix - things like that always make me wonder what kind of god could let that happen. It's conceivable that in a year or two I won't be allowed to wonder things like that in public because it might offend someone or incite someone else to religious hatred (a new thought crime, \"cruciphobia\" maybe).</p> <p>I'm pretty sure that individuals will continue to need religion, that some religious individuals will continue to do good in the world, and that religious institutions will continue to provide a sense of community and hope for those who can belong to them. That's where religion should remain, at the individual and local level, far from the societal or political sphere where it often contrives to do more harm than good.<br> <b>Marilyn</b></p> <p><b>Dear Marilyn</b><br> Plainly the proposed new law does need careful framing. Nor do we Christians need it. I don't think we need blasphemy to be outlawed either.</p> <p>But there surely are good arguments for outlawing the crude whipping up of mere hatred against minorities. As a matter of general principle, I think it makes perfect sense to protect not only racial but also multi-racial groups, such as the Muslim community in this country. Or Humanists!</p> <p>I've had rather an encouraging experience of the actual workings of British law this week. And I think it would be good to have the distinction between angry but thoughtful critique, on the one hand, and mere self-indulgent hatred, on the other hand, painstakingly tested, explored and negotiated in the courts.</p> <p>Indeed, it seems to me that the cause of Truth positively demands some such process. Doesn't it?<br> <b>All the best, Andrew</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Marilyn Mason is the education officer for the British Humanist Association; Andrew Shanks is the canon theologian at Manchester Cathedral</p>",
  "<p>For John Kerry it looks like being close, but no cigar. The presidential challenger is threatening a photo finish that looked well beyond his electoral powers only a few weeks ago. But this is a binary bet and there will be no spoils for a nearly man. There is sufficient uncertainty approaching Tuesday's finish line, however, for financial markets to be in a highly febrile state. </p> <p>As election day has drawn nearer, and the two candidates have drawn together in the opinion polls, so the US dollar has renewed the slide that had been on hold for the past six months. Other factors have been at work, it is true - notably the strength of the oil price - but it is hard to escape the conclusion that President Bush's increasingly sweaty-palmed hold on power has been a critical factor. </p> <p>I recently wrote in this column, while prematurely burying Senator Kerry's chances, that it was the economy that would determine the outcome of the election; and that Kerry had conspicuously failed to land a meaningful blow on this pretty static target. </p> <p>The senator's showing in the three live television face-offs with the president is being cited as the trigger for his late spurt. These were heavy on Iraq and attendant trust issues, and light on the economy. If Kerry falls just short of the line, he really might regret his neglect of the prosperity issue. </p> <p>Most financial markets will take their lead from the American currency in the immediate aftermath of the election. The greenback's fall over the past couple of weeks could be viewed as a sign of concern among traders at the prospect of a Democratic president, or at the increased chances of an ambiguous outcome, as occurred in 2000. </p> <p>In response to my attempts a few weeks ago to demystify the day-to-day movements in share prices, one reader has asked for a similar explanation of the foreign exchange markets. In particular, she asked whether the factors that drove share prices - supply and demand driven by profit prospects, management quality and the like - had parallels in currency movements. The simple answer is that indeed they do. </p> <p><strong> Basic laws</strong><br> </p> <p> Think of George Bush as chief executive of the world's largest industrial conglomerate and the rest of the world as potential consumers of its product, suppliers of raw materials to its production processes, and financiers of its activities. </p> <p>The movement of goods and services into USA Inc creates an excess supply of dollars in the market as products supplied from overseas need to be paid for in their local currencies. Conversely, any of USA Inc's output sold abroad creates excess demand for dollars as consumers of the goods need to pay for them in this currency. Any imbalance between the flow of goods in and the flow out will push the dollar down or up according to the basic laws of supply and demand. </p> <p>The third element in this equation is that of financing the great industrial venture. Investment projects are not always self-funding. Indeed the grander the project, the more likely the need for external finance. When USA Inc is expanding, it is likely to require capital from abroad to oil the wheels of its ambitions. So companies issue shares and the state issues bonds. If these are attractive enough to foreigners, their demand for them will create demand for the dollars necessary to buy them. </p> <p>In this way, USA Inc has managed, through its lengthy expansion phase, to balance the currency books. It has sucked in more goods and services from overseas than it has managed to sell products to foreigners. But the imbalance of trade this has created has been countered by the overseas appetite for American shares and government bonds. </p> <p><strong> Rationalised</strong><br> </p> <p> Which is where President Bush's role as chief executive of the enterprise is critical. Not because he is an economic wizard - he has a seasoned chief financial officer in the form of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan - but because he is a predictable quantity. Like all Identikit CEOs, he talks up his company's prospects through thick and thin, he's prepared to push thorough controversial measures for the sake of his overall enterprise and every action he takes can be rationalised in the context of his company's public mission statement. </p> <p>Suppliers, customers and financiers need not like or agree with that mission statement to want to do business with or finance USA Inc. But they are happy to know where they stand. If the CEO fends off his challenger this week, there will undoubtedly be a relief bounce in the dollar because it will be business as usual. </p> <p>A Kerry win, however, would mean a new mission statement for USA Inc - one that would not appear even to have been drafted yet. This would spook the world's financiers. They would want to run a credit check on the new CEO, and might even withdraw his funding in the meantime.

  "<p>With the FTSE 100 becalmed - no blue chip stock moved by more than 2% in either direction yesterday - bored City traders were forced to look lower down the corporate ladder to find some action.</p> <p>They settled on <strong>Edinburgh Oil &amp; Gas</strong>, the oil exploration minnow, whose only claim to fame is a 5% holding in Buzzard - the biggest North Sea oil discovery in over a decade.</p> <p>They pushed its shares up 14.5p to 189.5p - a record high - on the back of the rather obscure news that a Canadian company called EnCana had sold its UK operations to another Canadian company, called Nexen Inc, for $2.1bn (\u00a31.1bn).</p> <p>Now all of that is important for EOG because EnCana's main UK asset is a 43.2% stake in Buzzard. Traders reckon yesterday's deal puts a value of $1.8bn on EnCana's Buzzard holding. If that figure is correct then EOG's 5% stake must be worth \u00a3115m, or 270p-a-share. On top of that, yesterday's strong performance means EOG has a market value of \u00a380m and will be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE Small Cap index at the next quarterly review in December. If it is added to the index, then tracker funds will need to buy around 6.3m EOG shares - 15% of the company.</p> <p>In the wider market, leading shares closed lower for the first time in four days. The final scores showed the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> adrift 18.6 points at 4,624.2, with the heavyweight oil sector doing most of the damage as the crude price continued to fall in the wake of Thursday's Chinese interest rate rise.</p> <p>Brent, which lost over $1 on Thursday, closed around 32 cents lower at $48.05 a barrel. Over the week the blue chip index was little changed, rising just 8.8 points. Elsewhere, the <strong> FTSE 250</strong> fell 4.7 points to 6,321.8, while the <strong>FTSE Small Cap</strong> index firmed 1.5 points to 2,601.1. In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 4.733%.</p> <p>Back among the blue chips, <strong>William Morrison</strong> , the new owner of Safeway, managed to buck the weak market trend. Its shares gained 4.5p to 226.5p on positive feedback from a site visit organised by Swiss investment bank UBS. Although no new information was released, the rumour was that chairman Ken Morrison had struck a confident tone.</p> <p>Satellite broadcaster <strong>BSkyB </strong> , up 8.25p to 508.5p, was also in demand as buyers emerged ahead of its first quarter results, due on November 12. According to analysts if Sky announces that subscriber growth has improved in September and October the shares could enjoy a good run.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <strong>Shell Transport &amp; Trading</strong> dipped 6.75p to 428.75p after heavyweight broker Merrill Lynch downgraded to \"neutral\" from \"buy\" in the wake of Thursday's corporate restructuring news. Merrill reckons the shares, which enjoyed a strong run on Wednesday and Thursday, are now fairly valued.</p> <p>Lower down the market, the <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong> provided the traditional 'Friday afternoon' takeover story. Its shares advanced 11p to 365p - one of the best performances in the FTSE 250 - excited by talk that arch rival Deutsche Boerse may launch a bid over the weekend. Traders said the reappearance of the bid story was odd given reports earlier this week that the LSE was prepared to rebuff a merger with one of its European rivals unless the deal could provide clear improvements in cost and liquidity for its clients.</p> <p>Discount retailer <strong>Matalan</strong> firmed 3p to 229.5p as City speculators built positions ahead of next week's half-year figures. The talk in the Square Mile yesterday was that analysts would be upgrading their forecasts after the results on Tuesday.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the retail sector, <strong> MFI Furniture Group</strong> eased 0.5p to 102.5p as talk of a bid approach from <strong> GUS </strong> , up 5p to 891p, was offset by news that the company will not announce the findings of its supply chain review until the middle of next month - around two weeks later than expected.</p> <p>\"We suspect that the problems outlined with the profits warning in September are still far from being resolved. Even after recent share price weakness, the risk-reward trade-off looks uncompelling,\" German bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said.</p> <p>Among the small caps, on-line travel group <strong> Ebookers </strong> , up 20.5p to 250.5p, was the main talking point as bid rumours continued to swirl. The talk in the market yesterday was that the company could fetch as much as 350p-a-share. However, market professionals reckon a deal is still some way off with the interested parties, rumoured to include Priceline.com, having only just gained entry to the company's data room. Elsewhere, the smell of burnt fingers was wafting around <strong>Eckoh Technologies</strong> , down 1.62p to 9.12p, after the speech recognition software specialist suddenly announced takeover talks with <strong>Carphone Warehouse</strong> , 2.5p higher at 166.5p, had been terminated.</p> <p>There was also pain for shareholders of <strong>Catalyst Media Group</strong>. Its shares shed 1.25p to 6.75p after the company warned it would post a loss this year because of cost overruns on a contract to produce the ChampCar World Race Series. Despite that news, Catalyst fans are still optimistic the company will be able to finance the purchase of a 20% stake in Satellite Information Services, which supplies live racing pictures to bookmakers.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <strong>Belhaven</strong> , the Dunbar-based pubs and brewing company, remained in the doldrums. Traders said the shares, unchanged at 416.5p, were held back by talk that two Scottish institutions, Standard Life, which owns 7.4% of the company, and Scottish Widows, are looking to sell because of the prospect of a smoking ban in Scotland.</p> <p>Finally, <strong>Pipex</strong>, the broadband internet and web-hosting company controlled by entrepreneur Peter Dubens, jumped 1p, or 14%, to 8.25p, after a large overhang was finally cleared. Dealers reckon house broker Collins Stewart placed 80m shares owned by a former director with various City institutions. With that drag now removed the shares could have a run.</p> <p><strong>Ofex tussle</strong></p> <p>The attempt by Simon Brickles, the former head of AIM, to take control of Ofex by the backdoor was placed in doubt last night after the company, which runs London's third tier stock market, received a bid approach. </p> <p>Shield Investments said its all-paper offer, which includes a partial 6p-a-share cash alternative, was a better deal for shareholders who are currently being asked to support a highly-dilutive, emergency fund raising at 5p that will see Mr Brickles installed as chief executive. </p> <p>Shareholders are due to vote on the \u00a33.15m cash call on Monday. Shield, whose chairman is Keith Smith of City bank Nabarro Wells, said its offer could only proceed if shareholders voted against the fund raising. Ofex closed unchanged at 5.75p.</p>",

  "<p>Outside Grand Turk airport is a life-size replica of Friendship-7 - a terrifyingly small tin can of a spacecraft in which John Glenn became the first American astronaut to orbit the earth in 1962. The spacecraft landed offshore in the Atlantic and Glenn was brought to the island for a medical check-up before returning to the US. Since then, one local resident told me, \"not a lot has happened.\" </p> <p>Driving into the capital, Cockburn Town, my taxi driver had to stop to let a gaggle of scrawny horses cross the road. \"Them and the wild donkeys - you gotta watch out for them - 'specially at night,\" he warned. </p> <p>Six hundred miles south-east of Miami and a hundred miles north of Haiti, the Turks and Caicos Islands hang on to the end of the Bahamian archipelago. The Bahamas conjures images of sandy beaches, swanky hotels, twinkling casinos and perhaps even scenes from James Bond films. Mention the Turks and Caicos and people usually stare at you blankly. Although self-governing, the islands are part of the British West Indies, and they still have a governor who lives in a house called Waterloo. </p> <p>There are eight inhabited islands and another 28 sandy cays. Only two are the Turks Islands - Grand Turk and Salt Cay. Almost all tourists arrive at the international airport on Providenciales, one of the Caicos Islands, where expensive hotels and condominiums cater for the nearby US market. A 20-minute flight in a Twin Otter gets you to Grand Turk. With fewer than 5,000 residents, it's not exactly bustling. \"This is what makes Grand Turk special\" said Jenny Smith, the English owner of the Osprey Beach Hotel. \"We're like the Bahamas were 40 years ago.\" </p> <p>Jenny has renovated the hotel over the past year into something rather classier than the external architecture suggests. Dinner is taken around the pool with unobstructed views over the sandy beach. Twice a week there is live music, but most her guests tend to retire early - worn out by sea, sand and scuba. </p> <p>Part of Grand Turk's charm is that it has very little in the way of organised entertainment on offer. The largest hotel - the Osprey Beach - only has 24 rooms, and the island has no dock suitable for cruise ships. What it does have is remarkable beaches, excellent scuba-diving and a genuinely unspoilt charm. Wandering along Front Street from the hotel, I passed several ancient wooden buildings, similar to Bermuda's clapboard and tin-roofed style. </p> <p>Further along the seafront was a restored sea captain's home called Guinep House, named after the tree in front of the building, whose sour fruit, about the size of a grape, is sucked by local children like sweets. The house is now the Turks and Caicos National Museum devoted to artefacts salvaged from the Molasses Reef shipwreck. Excavated in the 1980s, it is the oldest wooden sailing vessel ever found in the Americas, dating from about 1520. At one time, people believed it might have been one of Columbus's fleet. </p> <p>Inside the museum I learned that Bermudan settlers first colonised Grand Turk in search of salt - a vital commodity for the British market in the 17th and 18th centuries. On one wall, there was an old colonial flag manufactured in England. The flag-makers had created a coat of arms superimposed over the Union Jack, with a sailing ship in the centre. In front of the ship a man is shown filling barrels of salt for export, with two white mounds of salt sitting on the quayside. Like so many modern-day Brits, the flag-makers weren't quite sure of the Turks and Caicos's exact location. Perhaps assuming that the salt piles represented igloos, they decided to insert two little doors into the piles. </p> <p>Behind Front Street was evidence of the salt industry that had once brought settlers and their African slaves to the island. The salt ponds - or salinas - are vast shallow lagoons where seawater evaporated under the sun, and the residue salt was raked into piles. Today they're home to flamingos. </p> <p>That night at the Salt-Raker Inn on Duke Street, Mitch Rolling, a local scuba instructor, was playing with his band, High Tide. They began with a mixture of folk, reggae and rock 'n' roll, before settling into an energetic round of what the islanders call \"rake and scrape\" music. One of the key elements of the band is a long-bladed saw, which is wedged against the player's groin while being raked with a metal bar to add a unique timbre to the music. There were a few tourists there, but it was mostly islanders clapping along to the music. </p> <p>Walking back along Front Street under a moonlit sky in the early hours, the tunes filled my head. And there was no traffic, not even a donkey to disturb the peace. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong>Getting there:</strong> <br>Grand Turk is comparatively cheap by Caribbean standards.

  "<p>My arrival in Wassu's crowded marketplace created the sort of hysteria more commonly reserved for pop stars or visiting dignitaries. Amid stalls of honey-coloured groundnuts and mammoth mounds of watermelons, I was besieged with cries of \"toubab, toubab\" (\"white man\") and followed down the road pied piper-like by hordes of children. It's almost as if the residents of Wassu had no idea that several hundred kilometres downriver, legions of toubabs have been parboiling en masse along the Gambian coastline for the past few decades. </p> <p>Most of the 60,000 British holidaymakers who arrive each year are unaware that much of the country remains traditional and undiscovered: they are simply seeking nailed-on winter sunshine. </p> <p>Recently, however, the Gambian Tourism Authority (GTA) wants to rebrand the country so that it's not seen solely as a package-holiday destination. It is concerned that mass beach tourism has not delivered economic benefits to the Gambian people; visitors have tended to stay around their hotel complexes, spending little within the local economy. And stories of hotel workers earning poverty wages and Gambians having to make a living from sex tourism have tarnished the image of Africa's self-styled \"Smiling Coast\". By promoting newer enterprises like upmarket hotels and eco-tourism, the GTA is hoping to target higher-spending tourists who venture beyond the resorts. </p> <p>It is actually quite easy to do your own thing in The Gambia. In the coastal resort of Fajara, for example, there's a delightful B&amp;B 10 minutes from the beach. Safari Garden is run by Geri and Maurice, an English couple who left behind the stresses of working in social services. My simple room looked on to a tropical compound full of rattling bamboo stems and citrus trees, a relaxed setting to sip chilled baobab juice at breakfast, or sample smoked bonga-fish pt\u00e9, part of Maurice's \"new-wave\" Gambian cuisine. And Geri was always cajoling guests to try djembe drumming or a spot of yoga by the pool. </p> <p>The Atlantic beaches in front of the resorts are stunning. But the pure white sands and fine body-boarding surf are backed by a sprawling seafront of hotels, bars, nightclubs, cyber-cafes, and restaurants dishing up anything from vermicelli to vindaloo. Nonetheless, it's OK as a base for excursions, to see fishermen delivering their overnight catches from beautifully decorated pirogues in Tanje's vibrant fish market, and to learn about some of The Gambia's 570-odd birds species in the Abuko nature reserve. </p> <p>There is life, if not sun-loungers, beyond the coast. Inland is a vastly different country. Travelling by bush taxi my first port-of-call was Tumani Tenda. Surrounded by ochre-coloured fields of couscous and red millet, mud-baked huts cluster around a spreading mango tree which functions as the village bantaba (meeting place). In its shade, a group of women pounded millet. No pop star greeting here - the villagers are used to welcoming toubabs since they won several thousand dollars in a national environmental competition in 1997. The 300 people of the Jola community then launched a tourism project for visitors to experience authentic Gambian village life. </p> <p>Guests are allocated their own little thatched hut (mine was next to a skyscraper termite mound) and presented with a list of activities. Options include tie-dying, dance and cookery. </p> <p>Two enthusiastic young guides, Omar and Sanna, took me on a village tour. After the three of us reviewed the Premiership football season and sorted out Iraq in Tumani Tenda's community forest, they explained the medicinal uses of the trees: locust-bean bark seems to be a panacea for anything from toothache to impotence. Then into the village garden, a fertile patchwork of okra, bitter-tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and \"garden eggs\" (aubergines). As dusk fell, we paddled a dugout on to Kafutu bolon, a salty creek dawdling southwards from the river Gambia, to see the evening harvest of river-oysters from the roots of red mangroves. </p> <p>Over a dinner of fried ladyfish, sticky cassava roots and oysters bathed in a fiery peanut sauce, Sulayaman Sonko, the driving force behind the project, talked of the pride he felt that tourism contributes to the village's self-sufficiency. But how do the villagers really feel about the tourists coming to their village? </p> <p>\"They're very happy,\" he says. \"But we don't want visitors handing out sweets and pens. It's a Jola tradition to control our own destiny and not depend upon charity.\" </p> <p>Further inland at Kudang jetty, I hopped on the Safari Queen, one of the few ferries operating along the powerful river Gambia, the country's watery spine. In contrast to journeying along pockmarked roads, cruising against the meandering currents was effortless. Baboons and red colobus monkeys lurked within the corridor of forest overhanging the riverbanks. In the shoals were hippos and great egrets, shining like drips of brilliant-white emulsion. </p> <p>At Wassu, the ferry paused for several hours - enough time for a pop star's entrance and to visit the village's famous stone circles. Almost smothered by freshly harvested wheat sheaves, maroon-coloured standing stones are arranged in half-a-dozen or so rings, resembling slightly burnt potato croquettes. They're no Stonehenge, but they do have an aura about them. A little site museum dates them to somewhere between 400 and 1000AD. </p> <p>Six hours upriver from our starting point, Kudang, our boat docked in the equatorial half-light on McCarthy island at the Bird Safari Camp, one of The Gambia's first eco-camps. Guests are separated from the rainforest by the thin canvas of tent (mine faced on to the river), but there is no sound-proofing from the cicadas. </p> <p>The camp is located on the outskirts of Georgetown, a former colonial settlement that has been in free fall for decades since the bottom fell out of groundnuts. These days, Georgetown's most valuable commodity is birds, and The Gambia is fast becoming one of Africa's premier bird-watching locations, accounting for almost a third of the country's tourism revenues. </p> <p> The next morning at six, I donned binoculars for a trek into the forest with Mansa, the camp's ornithologist. Sunrays pierced the canopy and it crackled with birdsong. I have to say I don't quite get the whole \"twitcher\" thing. I'd met a couple from York a few days earlier who were in a state of unashamed ecstasy about ticking off 106 species in just one day including the elusive African finfoot. So Mansa's infectious enthusiasm was wasted on me. We did see truly gorgeous creatures though: the long-tailed sunbird is as impressive as it sounds - but, to be honest, the most thrilling sight wasn't a bird. </p> <p>We came across an elderly man hauling himself high up in the canopy by a raffia strap to tap palm wine. When he returned to the ground he offered some of the sweet, milky fluid, fresh from the palm. It's quite delicious, fizzing as it touches the tongue. </p> <p>Returning to the coast for a last few days by the sea, I was set on finding my own slice of paradise, away from the built-up beaches. On Jinack, my prayers were answered. Cut off from the main resorts by the gaping mouth of the river Gambia, Jinack's 11km of perfect white sands have neither hotels nor crowds - just Madiyana Lodge, a castaway collection of raffia huts and a fine sea-view restaurant. With Niumi National Park's baobabs and spiky acacia forest as a backdrop, here was a proper place to chill, sip a few icy Julbrews, and enjoy fresh tuna caught on the line. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.gambia.co.uk\">The Gambia Experience</a> (0845 3304567) offers accommodation and flight-only packages from Gatwick, Bristol, Glasgow and Manchester, from \u00a3299pp.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.tribes.co.uk\">Tribes</a> (01728 685971) eight-day package includes stays at Tumani Tenda and the Balaba ecocamp.

  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I have made that trip on the night sleeper a number of times, although not for about five years. The Riga train used to leave Vilnius at around 11pm and would arrive in Riga at 6am. The only drawback was the border control at some ungodly hour of the morning. They would lock the loos at the border crossing so you couldn't even combine this rude awakening with some light relief! </p> <p>The sleepers, much like the French couchettes, are known as \"coupe\" (pronounced as an Englishman, not an American, would say the sportscar). They used to be mixed sex and I always found my fellow travellers to be kind and helpful, despite my beginners' grasp of Russian. Be aware of using Russian today as these countries are now independent and have their own languages. I learned to begin a conversation by saying in Russian \"I'm sorry but I only speak a bit of Russian\" to show I appreciated they may not want to converse in that language. </p> <p>You do sometimes hear of problems on the trains so, if you are on your own, do as I was once shown to do by the Bulgarian conductor on a Budapest-Warsaw sleeper: wedge a shoe in the safety chain lock so the door cannot be slid back enough for a small hand to reach around and slip the chain. </p> <p>The booking system is efficient, but try to book the previous day. Make sure you find your allocated space; I didn't on the first trip I made and, having stowed heavy cases and with absolutely no understanding of the language, was unceremoniously moved out and on to my correct seat. You'll find most of your fellow travellers will change into tracksuits and flip-flops (\"Schlopskis\" in Russian) when the train moves off, so a pair of flip-flops would be useful. </p> <p>Be prepared to be ripped off by the taxi drivers when you arrive in Riga. They pounce on the rather bleary-eyed passengers who are in no real state to argue the outrageous fare suggested. Finally, have fun, I always had a wonderful time in that part of the world and I'm sure you will too. <br> John Sidgwick </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Yes it is possible but the service is not very frequent, fast or direct. It's only 350km but can take anything between seven and 14 hours. Most people seem to take the Eurolines bus or fly (only 55 minutes). </p> <p>As well as using national rail companies' websites, I find the Thomas Cook European timetable a good way of getting the big picture on which routes are the main ones and so likely to have a quicker, more frequent service. It's good value at a tenner from <a href=\"http://www.thomascookpublishing.com\">Thomas Cook</a> headquarters in Peterborough. Don't waste your time asking for the timetable at Thomas Cook branches; they are likely to tell you it doesn't exist.<br>Adrian Tayler </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I investigated this option earlier this year. There is no direct rail service anymore due to the state of the track (the official explanation anyway), and there hasn't been for a year or two. I'm not sure if it's possible to change trains, while staying within the two countries concerned. There are options via Belarus, but you'll need an expensive transit visa for travel via this route.<br>Don Bradley </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I advise going by bus rather than train for two reasons. First, the state of trains in the Baltic States is still rather poor, although things are improving. Second, the time taken by train is much longer than by bus. Eurolines operates a service that runs from Kaliningrad to Tallinn hitting Vilnius and Riga along the way. This service will leave Vilnius five or more times a day with a cost of about \u00a37 return if only going to Riga. You can either book in advance at <a href=\"http://www.eurolines.it\">Eurolines</a> or get better prices and services by going to a travel agency once you arrive in Vilnius. If you buy through the latter, they will have first-hand information on which bus stop you need. I have travelled Eurolines many times across the Baltic States and never had a problem.<br> David Galbreath, Aberdeen</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday November 12, 2004</strong></p> <p>In the article we refer to Charlton Orchards in Somerset and state that it is owned by June and Robin Small.

Before I read this book, I thought an apple was something you picked and ate some time around October. Now I know the best dessert apples are those that must be stored for a month or more. There are some that aren't ready to come off the tree until December; others that are unfit to eat unless they've been in the cellar from October to March. There is one variety, the Winter Greening (Shakespeare's Apple-John), that can be kept for two years. There are apples that taste of aniseed, banana, pineapple, caraway, and apples that can't be eaten in any state, but are grown for making cider. Some are the size of walnuts: the smaller they are, Hogg and Bull contend, the better the cider. </p> <p>Dr Hogg and Dr Bull were commissioned to write the Pomona by the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club, a society of Herefordshire doctors, vicars and farmers famed for its fungus forays. \"These forays,\" the doctors lamented, \"could not fail to impress upon the members the sad state of neglect into which the orchards of Herefordshire had been allowed to fall ... the observation was made that 'celebrated as Herefordshire is for its orchards, it was very remarkable that so few of the best varieties of apples should appear in the markets, or fruit shops, of Hereford'.\" </p> <p>It's hard to see what they were complaining about. Between 1876 and 1883 (when they were compiling the Pomona), Herefordshire's orchards grew by 10%, to 27,000 acres. Altogether, 186,000 acres of England grew fruit trees. Today, that figure is 44,000. The area under apple trees has halved since 1994; the amount of fruit they produce has fallen by 50% since 1999. </p> <p>Some of the reasons for this tragedy would have been familiar to the pomologists. \"The power of the steam engine by land and by sea,\" they complained, \"lessens expenditure by cheapness of conveyance, thus wider markets are offered for all articles of trade ... Competition becomes world-wide ... To individuals and localities the result is often ruinous ... American and Continental apples are brought year by year in larger quantities to supply our great centres of population. They are always noted for those first two marketable qualities 'size' and 'beauty of colour'. \" </p> <p>But our remaining orchards are also threatened by something they wouldn't have anticipated: the EU, and one of the maddest decisions it has made since it determined that the carrot was a fruit. On January 1 next year, the European subsidy system changes. From then on, production subsidies will start to be withdrawn and agricultural land will instead qualify for something called a Single Farm Payment of about \u00a3200 a hectare. While every other kind of farming, even growing ornamental shrubs in greenhouses, will be eligible, commercial orchards will be classified as \"non-agricultural\". And January 1 is the cut-off date: if you don't grub up your orchards by the end of the year, you and your descendants will be \u00a3200 a hectare poorer, every year for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>But to understand the potential impact of this measure, we must first understand how close to the edge our surviving fruit growers have already been pushed, as a result of that problem with which Drs Hogg and Bull were familiar: the lessening of expenditure by cheapness of conveyance. Let us begin in the world's least likely centre of biodiversity: Slough. Here, amid the gasometers and yellow brick estates, we find Nick Houston, tweed cap, red beard, fag and jackknife, shoving his way through the jungle. \"Golden russet. It's in here somewhere.\" Chainsaw boots. Square basket knocking against his thighs. Then a voice from the undergrowth. \"Here it is. Take a look at that. I don't know which golden russet, because this one isn't in the National Fruit Collection. They've got one, but it doesn't match. Stores till June. Not fit to eat till February. Bloody marvellous.\" </p> <p>I first met Nick last winter, when I wanted to buy some fruit trees. I had a copy of The Fruit And Vegetable Finder, published in 1995. It listed JC Allgrove's as the last of the great nurseries of the Thames Valley. In the 1940s, it kept 1,000 varieties of apple tree; in 1995 it still sold 250. I rang the number in the book and a woman answered. \"I'm sorry, dear,\" she said, \"we shut down a couple of years ago. But you could talk to Nick. He might have something left over.\" </p> <p>Nick had taken over the nursery, unpaid, when the last Mr Allgrove fell ill. But it hadn't been commercially viable for years. The orchards that once bought the young trees had been grubbed up. Now the only calls came from enthusiasts. \"I've been trying to keep it ticking over,\" he said, \"but they've had to put the land on the market, so it's pretty well finished.\" </p> <p>Nick found me half a dozen saplings he had grafted a couple of years before. That was almost the last of the stock. When I returned in September, to see the old trees in fruit, there was a new lock on the gate. The new owners were sympathetic and let us in. But the land hadn't come cheap and keeping a forest of 250 forgotten varieties of apple tree isn't the kind of business model the bank manager would appreciate. </p> <p>No one knows exactly what the orchard contains, but besides the golden russet, Nick is convinced that somewhere in the jungle is a St Augustine's Orange and a King Harry - both officially extinct. Hardly any of the breeds there are still grown commercially. </p> <p>If you blot out the outskirts of Slough, creeping over the tops of the trees, the orchard looks like a 15th-century painting of the Garden of Eden. Nick showed me a Tudor apple, the Devonshire Quarrenden, deep purple and an inch and a half across. \"Juicy, aromatic, soon goes over.\" A few yards away was a cooker, the Reverend W Wilkes, raised at the turn of the century by the first Mr Allgrove: pale, almost spherical, pulling the boughs to the ground. Some of the apples must have weighed two pounds. Nick picked me a St Edmund's Pippin, russeted, yellow-green, sweet and lemony, far better than the gritty Egremont Russet the superstores call the connoisseur's apple. </p> <p>There was a Miller's Seedling, small, striped green and red, the juiciest, sweetest fruit I've ever eaten. \"It used to fill the London markets, but today, because it's small and doesn't keep, no one's interested.\" The Golden Noble, primrose yellow, \"more vitamin C than any other cooker\". An Ellison's Orange, which I knew the moment I tried it. \"Everyone used to have one of these in his garden,\" said Nick, and I remembered, though I had never known the name, that my father had one in his. You couldn't mistake it for anything else: the flesh tastes faintly but distinctly of Pernod. </p> <p>\"Ahh! Belle de Boskoop. The wife practically sued this one for adultery. It's gorgeous.\" A Pitmaston Pineapple: conical yellow apples hanging, perfectly spaced, like Christmas tree baubles. \"Right now it's inedible. But leave it till December and it tastes of pineapple and honey. And what do they plant? Bloody Fiesta!\" </p> <p>\"Why? Why won't they plant the old kinds?\" </p> <p>\"Supermarkets. There seems to be a fatwa on home-grown apples. They're interested only in consistent appearance. They dictate what gets grown, how big it is, what colour, how it's picked and stored. They're not interested in taste. I think they're round the bend.\" </p> <p>On the way back to the gates, Nick showed me the old farm sheds. In one was a pile of stakes on which names were painted in big black letters, markers for the old trees. Nick rummaged through the pile: \"Extinct, extinct, extinct.\" He was still grafting a few of the rare varieties, in case anyone rang. \"Otherwise,\" he said, \"that's it. It's sad, but what can you do?\" </p> <p>The problem was the commercial buyers had gone. When the nursery was founded, long before the Pomona was published, the land around Slough was one of Britain's best fruit-growing regions. It split the London markets with Kent. At St Mary's Church in Harmondsworth, five miles from the nursery, I found a big tabular grave in grim brown sandstone, where lay one \"Richard Cox Esq, who departed this life on May 20th 1845\". Cox crossed a Blenheim Orange with a Ribston Pippin. The result sped the downfall of his beloved English orchards: New Zealand could produce the Cox's Orange Pippin more cheaply than we could. By the time it gets to Britain, it tastes of kitchen towels dipped in glucose, but it's cheap and it looks right - and that, it seems, is what counts. </p> <p>Three miles from Cox's grave is where the best orchard land used to be: around a sleepy Middlesex village called Heathrow. The apple trees and strawberry farms were flattened to build runways, and now \"the power of the steam engine by land and by sea\" is augmented by the jet engine. Exotic fruits from all over the world land on the grubbed-out orchards. </p> <p>Step into any supermarket and you'll see the result. I chose Sainsbury's in Taunton, for two reasons. It is in the middle of one of Britain's last surviving apple-growing regions, and 300 yards from the store there was a farmers' market at which (it was the beginning of the season) five varieties of English apple were being sold, from an orchard a couple of miles away. </p> <p>There were 12 breeds of apple in Sainsbury's, if you included the conventional and organic versions of the same varieties. Two were English: a huge, glossy ball of hybridised pap called an Elstar, and a Bramley. The Bramley reminded me of what Nick had said about the supermarkets' specifications. Allowed to ripen on the branch, it is pale green with plenty of red, the flesh is soft and fluffy, and it cooks beautifully. But the superstores demand a pure dark green apple. When Nick worked in commercial orchards, he was told to bend down the Bramleys' branches, so the fruit was shielded from sunlight, in order to stop it changing colour. This also stopped it acquiring flavour or sweetness, but that didn't seem to matter. \"They told us to pick it unripe, when it was as appetising as a cricket ball and you'd need a pneumatic drill to get into it.\" </p> <p>Anyway, even the ripest, sweetest Bramley ever grown doesn't touch the Reverend W Wilkes for texture and flavour. But the Wilkes, or the Golden Noble, or the Arthur Turner, couldn't, unlike the concrete Bramley, be fired through a barn door at 30 paces and land unscathed, so it doesn't meet the superstores' two overriding specifications: that it keeps for ever and won't bruise. </p> <p>There were Royal Galas and Golden Delicious from France, organic Royal Galas from Italy, Pink Lady, Braeburn, Granny Smith and Sundowner from South Africa, and Jazz, Braeburn and organic Pink Lady from New Zealand. They were all big, juicy and consistent in appearance, but eat them blindfolded and you'd be hard put to distinguish one from another. </p> <p>But the oddest item was the Cox's Orange Pippin from Holland. It was odd for three reasons. First, it didn't look like a Cox, which is supposed to be red and yellow with plenty of russeting: these were smooth and dark green with a bit of red. Second, this (it was September 16) was at least three weeks before Coxes were ready to eat. Third, when asked about their buying policy, the supermarkets said their English apple season hadn't yet begun, which was why they were still stocking apples from elsewhere. </p> <p>Well, plainly the English apple season had begun: you had only to walk down the high street to find Worcester Pearmain, Greensleeves, Spartan, Lord Lambourne and (almost edible) Bramleys in the farmers' market. But the Cox season hadn't begun. If they were buying unripe Coxes from Holland, why not from Somerset? More to the point, why couldn't they buy ripe Worcesters from down the road? </p> <p>Neil Gibson is responsible for buying Sainsbury's apples. I met him near Canterbury, in a packing shed belonging to England's biggest apple grower. </p> <p>What do you picture when you hear \"English orchard\"? Nothing, I suspect, like the thing I encountered at Mansfield Farms. The company has 3,000 acres of trees - almost one-sixth of the English eating apple orchards. So the first thing you see is a giant car park, with white minibuses dropping off pickers and packers. And behind it, three huge steel sheds. </p> <p>The apples are dropped into water and floated on to a conveyor belt. It takes them through a giant hood like a Cat scanner, where they are photographed and compared, by computer, to the transcendental form being packed that day. When I visited, they were packing Royal Gala for Sainsbury's, who wanted the apples to be 60% red and above a certain diameter, measured to the nearest millimetre. On other days they packed for Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer or Somerfield; each demands different colour ratios and the machine is calibrated accordingly. The computer feeds instructions to a conveyor belt, made of hundreds of rotating brushes. Apples that fail the test are shunted into a different lane and drop down a shute. The others are rolled into trays, which move down the loading jetties. Here, workers dressed in Guant\u00e1namo orange make sure they've settled into the trays, then feed them through a machine that slaps on the little stickers. Supervisors in white coats dash from jetty to jetty. </p> <p>Gibson, a pleasant young man, had been on the media training courses and said all the right things. Sainsbury's, he said, is doing its best to help British apple growers and now sells 15 English varieties, more than any other supermarket. It had even introduced a couple of traditional breeds in its \"season's best\" range, including the St Edmund's Pippin. </p> <p>\"But surely a lot of those British apples are really New Zealand or Canadian varieties being grown here?\" </p> <p>\"Well, supermarkets have to sell varieties consumers want to buy. Royal Gala is a key variety for them. It's been successfully grown in the UK for five or 10 years, which means we can source the majority of our Royal Gala from the UK during the British season.\" </p> <p>So this is purely driven by the consumer? It's not driven by the supermarkets' need to stock an apple that doesn't bruise easily, that stores easily, that can be grown in bulk to a standard shape and size? </p> <p>\"Not at all. To give an example, we've encouraged the growth of Braeburn in the UK and have been able to source 300 tonnes of them from Britain each year.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, the claim that their decisions are governed entirely by consumer demand is simply wrong. The superstores have withdrawn one of the most popular modern varieties, the Katy, because it bruises easily, which means they lose too much stock as they truck it from John O'Groats to Land's End via Spitsbergen and back. And whoever asked for a Bramley with the texture of depleted uranium? </p> <p>Only 20% of the apples sold in the UK are grown here, and most of the surviving producers are trying to compete directly with foreign growers by cultivating the same varieties. It's a mug's game: over the past 10 years, China has planted more orchards than there are in western Europe, with the obvious result that the only viable future for the British apple grower is to produce fruit that isn't being grown anywhere else. That is certainly what June and Robin Small, owners of Charlton Orchards in Somerset, have found. </p> <p>Now, this is an English orchard of the kind you might have pictured. Round, green trees with round, red apples on a sunlit field giving on to the Blackdown Hills. In the branches, like giant birds, perch multicoloured hippies: the students who have come to pick the fruit. From the pages of the same unlikely storybook walk Robin and June - white hair, apple cheeks, strong hands, broad Zumerzett. </p> <p>The Smalls have 40 acres of fruit. Until six years ago, they sold it to the superstores, but they found them harder and harder to deal with. \"They wanted apples all of the same size, same colour, same shape,\" said June. \"And it meant ours were not acceptable. We do grow some odd-shaped ones in this country.\" </p> <p>\"They were paying a reasonable price 15, 20 years ago,\" said Robin. \"But the price wasn't rising and our costs were. They could source apples from anywhere in the world, at a price that suited them. In the UK, it's harder to grow high-yielding crops. But because the apples grow more slowly, the flavour is much better.\" </p> <p>A few years ago, a French farmers' market came to Taunton. The Smalls went, and saw that they had a way out. They got together with the local bakers, cheesemakers and vegetable growers, and started setting up markets of their own. Now they supply 20 every month. Through the markets and their farm shop, they shift 200 tonnes of apples a year. They introduce customers to unfamiliar varieties by giving them samples to taste, and they've discovered that the enthusiasm for diversity is almost limitless. They now grow 35 varieties of apple, mostly old ones, among them Ribston Pippin, Ashmead's Kernel and Grenadier. The market is there - the growers just have to find a way of reaching it. The problem for anyone bigger than the Smalls is that the superstores stand between them and their customers. </p> <p>But, of course, that's not the only problem. The other one arrives on January 1, courtesy of the EU. The man who has been leading the fight against it is a cider grower in Somerset called Julian Temperley, whose Burrow Hill cider has sped the passage of, well, I forget how many pleasant evenings. He uses the old processes, grows the old fruit, and is largely responsible for the revival of the Kingston Black, an apple that inspires awe among those who know it. </p> <p>The day did not begin well. I spotted him hobbling out of a barn, one foot in plaster, army surplus trousers, roughly shaven, hair like the aftermath of a hurricane. </p> <p>\"Are you Julian Temperley?\" </p> <p>\"Yes. Who are you?\" A posh voice, a bit offhand. </p> <p>\"George Monbiot. We spoke last week.\" </p> <p>\"Monbiot ! Were you the fucking dipstick on the radio this morning?\" </p> <p>\"Er, I was on the radio.\" </p> <p>\"Right, well you can fuck off.\" </p> <p>\"But ... \" </p> <p>\"It's basic tolerance, isn't it? You wouldn't ban halal meat, would you, but it's all right to ban hunting, because the Norman aristocrats did it. What fucking nonsense. No, just fuck off.\" </p> <p>\"That's not quite ... \" </p> <p>\"Show me your hands. You see! Never done a day's work in your life.\" </p> <p>\"Well, you talk about tolerance ... \" </p> <p>\"No. Fuck off.\" </p> <p>I was about to fuck off, but I had a camera crew with me, and the producer took Temperley's elbow and walked him off across the farmyard. I'm not sure what she said, but when I caught up with them, he turned and said, \"Right, where do you want to do this?\" </p> <p>As soon as he got on to apples, he appeared to forget he was talking to the urban jackboot. He took us round the orchards and his barns, and gave us lunch, with a very good bottle of Kingston Black champagne. </p> <p>\"It'll be a disaster,\" he said of the new EU legislation. \"The financial incentive to cut down these trees is going to be huge. You can't blame the farmers - they've got a living to make. If the land is excluded, its capital value will go down. It's a complete cock-up.\" </p> <p>There is some confusion about what, exactly, will qualify for subsidies under the Single Payment Scheme. No one disputes that commercial orchards won't qualify, or that this is a discouragement to stay in business. As the British government admits, \"Commercial apple growers who have found it difficult to secure contracts may feel they have little alternative but to grub up and claim the Single Payment.\" </p> <p>Some plots, perhaps those with fewer than 50 trees a hectare or where farmers have already been receiving subsidies for the animals grazing under their trees, should qualify for the new payment. By the time this article is published, it should be clear which land is in and which is out. Either way, we're certain to lose even more orchards. </p> <p>Julian won't be grubbing up his trees: he makes his own cider, so he doesn't rely on anyone else buying his apples. But for some of his neighbours, whose market is less secure, it'll be the final blow of the axe. Julian took us to meet Andrew Foote, whose 10 acres of apples were planted by his grandfather. It's an orchard of precisely the kind the government agency English Nature says should be preserved: old trees wreathed in mistletoe, with holes in which woodpeckers and little owls might nest, growing ancient varieties such as Red Worthy and Porter's Perfection. It looked magnificent, the great gnarly trees billowing with red and yellow fruit. But Andrew said he'd grub them out before the New Year, \"unless things change drastically. I feel very sad about it. Some varieties you probably won't ever see again. You like to try to keep things going, but those that have the power decide. You're going to see fires round here as big as the foot and mouth fires. Only it'll be just trees. There's always been apples here, and I'd like to see my young boy carry on with it. But that future's gone.\" </p> <p>The old varieties won't disappear altogether. They'll be kept alive by a few enthusiasts, found in some farmers' markets or the odd specialist line in the superstores. The charity Common Ground and a few enlightened county councils have been helping to plant community orchards and run Apple Days. But, as Robin Small told me, \"The very large growers will survive, and a few of the smaller ones, if they do what we've done and go to the public direct. Everyone in between will have a very, very hard time.\" </p> <p>When I came back from Somerset, I applied to the local allotment association for an orchard plot. I've just received the keys, and there's room for at least 20 trees. I'll ask Nick to help me choose what to plant, but I know that among them will be the Ribston Pippin, the Reverend W Wilkes, the Belle de Boskoop and the Pitmaston Pineapple. I will build an apple store and do what it says in Hogg and Bull's. And I'll never buy a Braeburn or a Granny Smith again </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>George Monbiot's film on the decline of the English apple will be on Newsnight on BBC2 at 10.30pm on November 8.</p>",
  "<p>It was exactly 12 months ago that I first began looking for an investment property to buy in Oxford, but under the present circumstances - after five interest rate rises and increasingly grim news about house prices - I would not have the guts to do anything similar today.</p> <p>It is chilling to remember how quickly, and how optimistically, I made such a big purchase this time last year. But the deed was done in May and the tenants are still in the flat, despite a continuing problem with damp in the plaster.</p> <p>The builder assures me that it is normal for it to take up to 12 months to dry completely, and generously contributed a big dehumidifier to help, but the dreadful summer weather has been like a wet blanket - both literally and metaphorically. The tenants are taking it in their stride, but a rent increase is right out for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>In addition, a strange shadow has appeared on one of the bedroom walls - not in the shape of anything commercially useful, like the face of Jesus, but in the shape of a giant moth. It is very symmetrical and mysterious, unrelated to the position of any of the pipe work or drainage, and reappears through the new layers of paint that have been applied. The builder is stumped, the tenants bemused.</p> <p>Lately I've been investigating some other mysterious phenomena, such as how it is possible to spend \u00a3900 on waste bins for 10 flats. I received my first statement of charges from the management company, which showed that I paid 12 months of fees as part of the completion transaction, despite taking possession of the flat four months into the year. I had several questions, among them:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Are they buying the bins from Harrods?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Will I get a refund on the service charges relating to the first four months of the year, when I did not own the flat?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> What happened to the plan of paying monthly for the service charge (my preferred option)?</p> <p>The answers were 'no', 'no', and 'you didn't tell us'. It turns out that any overpayment of the service charges, when compared to the actual spend on maintenance, is carried over into the next year.</p> <p>At no point was I offered the choice of paying monthly, (an option specified in the lease), and the day of completion was such a chaotic mess that I overlooked it then. Another lesson learned: I will be paying monthly next year. My view is that the money will be cosier in my bank account than in the management company's \"sink fund\".</p> <p>And just to make life really interesting, I have rented out my own house, so I am now managing two rental properties 40 miles away from where I live. Initially I used two letting agents on either side of Oxford, including the one who produced the tenants for my flat.</p> <p>But after several weeks of viewings but no bookings, and the dead winter season approaching, we parted. No money changed hands, although they had both advertised the property more than once. I placed an advert on a free website which produced two nice young women sharers, saving myself \u00a3500 in fees.</p> <p>But this small saving was quickly offset by bigger expenditures, in another example of what I am coming to think of as Vanessa's Law. When I informed my lender, Nottingham Building Society, that I had let the property that I had been living in and was letting it out, they levied an extra 1% of interest and an \u00a380 \"administration fee\".</p> <p>The fun started in earnest when I tried to obtain landlord's contents insurance on both properties. I tried five insurers before I found a broker, Household Insurance Services, which could insure the contents in a let property, but they helpfully explained that it would be much cheaper to insure the contents through the buildings insurance provider.</p> <p>In a flash of inspiration, I phoned NFU Mutual, who provide the buildings insurance on the buy-to-let flat, for which I pay a share through the management company.</p> <p>I explained that I was the landlord of one of the units, and was told by the nice young man that I could not benefit by insuring the contents with them because the policy was in the developer's name.</p> <p>Never mind, I said, quote me miserable then. First the nice young man was required to give me the full rendition of the company's terms and conditions, the FSA regulations, and the names and hobbies of the managing director's children, lasting around five minutes. At the end of which, there was this exchange:</p> <p><strong>Me:</strong> You do realise that the property is let?</p> <p><strong>NFU:</strong> Uh, sorry, we don't do landlord's contents insurance.</p> <p>Back to Household Insurance Services. Since I could not purchase new buildings insurance for the flat, the minimum insurable value of the contents was a whopping \u00a312,000. This was for an unfurnished, one-bedroom flat, in which my only possessions include carpets, curtains and white goods.</p> <p>Still, at \u00a3104, the premium seems a bargain for that! But after buying new buildings insurance for the house, in order to get the contents insurance cheaper, I am \u00a3300 worse off in total.</p> <p>After five months of landladyship, my balance sheet remains static. In less than 12 months it will turn red when the mortgage comes off its low-start rate.</p> <p>I need to save as much money as possible in the meantime, and hope that all my tenants stay put.</p> <p>Oh, and face up to the tax implications at some point. But that is one for another day.</p> <p>The good news is that, according to the estate agent who sold me the flat, prices in Oxford are stable. In addition, my flat has the advantage of being brand-new and lovely (especially if you have a thing about moths).</p> <p>Then an email from the flat's tenant informs me that the first settlement cracks have started to appear ...</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Contacts: <a href=\"http://www.household-insurance-services.co.uk\">www.household-insurance-services.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The music industry has got considerable publicity for its drive to prevent unauthorised downloading of music from the internet. Trade association, the British Phonographic Institute (BPI), claims to have details of the computers of the 28 most serious abusers of the intellectual property rights of record companies and is threatening to sue those people, once it finds out who they are. </p> <p> The BPI faces a number of legal and technical hurdles in this battle. Even if computers used have been correctly identified, it will next have to force the internet service providers (ISP) to give it their subscribers' names. The courts will probably order this on the basis that the ISP is facilitating the illegal activity. </p> <p>This principle was established in 1973 when Norwich Pharmacals brought an action against the Customs &amp; Excise which had allowed the import of drugs which were allegedly infringing patents. The case was followed against the Motley Fool, an ISP whose customer had committed libel pseudonymously in 2001. Most file swappers will be using broadband paid for with a credit card, which is more traceable than dial up services, but some will prove untraceable whatever a court orders. </p> <p>It is only once such an order is obtained that those targeted by the industry will find out what is going on. It is possible that the BPI will then go on to get search orders from the High Court which would enable them to raid premises where the computers are kept and, under strict supervision, inspect the equipment for evidence of wrong-doing. </p> <p>These orders are discretionary and judges may well take the view that they are disproportionate and that the BPI will have to prove its case in other ways. Establishing a case against a teenager using a family computer - probably the typical culprit - will be virtually impossible. People under 18 can be sued but there is no realistic way of enforcing a judgment against them. </p> <p>Parents are not liable for their children's actions, and neither does merely being the owner of a computer on which someone has committed an illegal activity create liability. It is doubtful that an ordinary civil injunction can be made against a child. </p> <p> While suggestions that anti-social behaviour orders might be available are a bit far-fetched, it is unlikely that the courts would allow youth to be relied on by someone to deliberately flout the law. Anyone receiving a letter from the BPI or its solicitors demanding information about who uses a computer should not reply without taking their own legal advice. There will be many circumstances where the most effective form of defence is to remain absolutely silent. </p> <p>It may well be that the BPI is making its present public pronouncements more with a view to deterrence than actual court proceedings. The entertainment industry is forever promising legal action against those who breach its rights. </p> <p>Even the relatively low tech breachs committed in my teenage days - recording a track off the radio, which was usually spoilt by the DJ talking over it anyway - were subject to such threats. </p> <p> Those who read last month's Jobs &amp; Money, which exposed of the lengths some artists have to go to to secure royalties from record companies, will find a certain poetic justice in the industry being ripped off by the public. </p> <p>BPI's chairman Peter Jamieson claim that file sharers stealing the livelihood of \"thousands of artists\", will in that context seem hypocritical. It is companies such as EMI which are able to pay \u00a380m to Robbie Williams, ironically himself a supporter of file sharing, on whose behalf this battle is being fought. The amount of damage that is caused to the music industry is in any case debatable. </p> <p>A study by academics - including Felix Oberholzer-Gee of Harvard - which examined sales trends on heavily-downloaded files found the impact of downloading on sales was \"statistically indistinguishable from zero\". While this research has been attacked by the BPI and its American counterpart, it is probably more reliable than surveys which have simply asked downloaders whether they buy less music as a result. </p> <p>A British survey last year by Music Programming Limited actually found that file sharing stimulated off-line sales. The fact, for instance, that record companies were illegally retaining over $50m royalties until an investigation by New York's attorney general ordered them to hand it over last year is of little relevance if the battle is to be fought in the courts. </p> <p>If the real battleground is the media, the industry's PR machine should not prevent as much attention being paid to the dishonesty of the industry as of its customers. </p>",
  "Jack Straw revealed an 18-month game plan to win a referendum on the European Union's first constitution yesterday with a vote scheduled for March or April 2006. <p>The foreign secretary laid bare British thinking on the day EU leaders formally signed the new constitution in Rome amid much pomp and dispute about the legal implications for the sovereignty of nation states. </p> <p>The prime minister's spokesman also confirmed that Britain would go ahead with a referendum, even if other countries, such as France, rejected the constitution in their polls, scheduled for 2005. He also ruled out holding a single joint referendum on the constitution and the euro. </p> <p>Setting out government thinking more clearly than before, Mr Straw said it would be impractical to hold the vote in the second half of 2005, when the UK would be holding the EU presidency. </p> <p>The Europe minister, Denis MacShane, also breached supposed protocol by confirming that the first half of 2005 would be taken up with the general election. </p> <p>Explaining government thinking, Mr Straw said: \"In the autumn of 2005 we have the presidency of the European Union. It would be practically almost impossible to combine both running the presidency with holding a referendum. That is true for any government.\" </p> <p>Mr MacShane said: \"You will have a parliamentary bill in the Queen's speech on the treaty, a normal treaty bill. That will take up the first two or three months of next year. We will then have a general election in which candidates will stand very clearly on a pro- or anti-European ticket. </p> <p>\"We then have the six months of the UK presidency of Europe where it's pretty inconceivable, given how much time that absorbs for everybody in government, that you could run a referendum alongside. </p> <p>\"That takes us into early 2006.\" </p> <p>Ministers want the referendum campaign to start soon after the end of the British presidency in December 2005 in the hope that a successful presidency will educate the British public on the virtues of the constitution and of Europe. </p> <p>Tony Blair left the signing ceremony in Rome before other Europe leaders. No 10 said he had always intended to leave quickly once his engagements were complete. </p> <p>All 25 EU member states now have two years to complete ratification. So far, eight countries have set dates for referendums, with the first in Spain on February 20 2004, followed by Portugal (April 10), Holland (March or April), France (possibly May 8) and Poland (May or October). </p> <p>Informal discussion is already under way on how to campaign on the referendum. </p> <p>The pressing issue for Mr Blair is to make sure it does not become a referendum on his leadership, raising questions on how direct and prominent a role he should play. It has already been agreed that the Britain in Europe campaign will be more independent from Downing Street, but the campaign has been operating on the assumption of a spring 2006 referendum for some time. </p> <p>Michael Howard, the Tory leader, said the constitution would give European judges \"a pretty blank sheet of paper on which to start rewriting UK employment and trade union legislation\". </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Sir Menzies Campbell, called the constitution a \"sensible rationalisation\" of existing EU treaties.</p>",
  "The rural middle class seldom enthuses about the law courts these days, for they are perceived as absurdly indulgent to hooligans, asylum seekers, murderers and malefactors of all kinds. Yet a mighty cheer went up on Tuesday, following the conviction of a career burglar named John Rae, who was jailed for seven years for a long series of offences. <p>The cause of the applause was that Judge Andrew Hamilton endorsed the action of a 73-year-old Derbyshire farmer, Kenneth Faulkner, who shot Rae in the leg during an attempted break-in, after an earlier burglary in which some of his guns had been stolen. \"Mr Faulkner believed that he was being targeted,\" said the judge, \"and he was entirely right. He wrongly believed that the burglars had come back armed with those guns that had been stolen. Very sensibly he took out his own shotgun. No one could criticise him for what he did.\" </p> <p>The judge went on to deplore the fact that the Crown Prosecution Service considered charges of assault against the farmer, which were dropped only shortly before Rae's trial. Here at last, in the minds of many country people, was a sensible judicial view about a man's right to protect himself. </p> <p>The police, however, seemed thoroughly alarmed by the judge's comments. No doubt envisaging a barrage of gunfire against suspected intruders, the Association of Chief Police Officers issued a statement urging householders not to resist. Instead, said Acpo, they should lock themselves into a room and dial 999: \"You should not approach the intruder. If the intruder steals some of your property, that's far better than someone being killed.\" </p> <p>These words prompted a jeer of derision in many a village pub. The police have a rotten record of effective intervention at scenes of rural crime. The shortcomings of law enforcement were highlighted the very next day, when a fiasco was reported in the press. A farmer who caught and successfully detained two intruders stealing tractor diesel fuel from his tank in the presence of witnesses was told that the thieves would not be prosecuted \"for lack of evidence\". Critics demand: how can the police with straight faces urge householders to rely on the law, when the law is an ass? </p> <p>About now, some readers may suppose that I am launching a manifesto for the right of property owners to shoot down burglars. Not so. The doctrine of \"proportionate force\" in resisting crime, enshrined in existing law, seems absolutely correct. I have owned guns all my life. Yet, unless I perceived myself and my loved ones facing an indisputable threat to our own lives, I cannot imagine attempting to shoot somebody. </p> <p>In the United States, gun ownership is widespread. A right to defend property is recognised in law. The consequence is that there are horrific cases of innocent people being gunned down by mistake, for instance when they knock up a house at night to ask directions. Some Americans argue that this is a price worth paying for achieving a burglary rate much lower than that which prevails in Europe. Most of us dissent. </p> <p>British law dealt harshly with the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin, who received a long term of imprisonment after shooting a burglar dead. A token sentence seemed more appropriate, when Martin had been grievously provoked by repeated visits from inveterate thieves. </p> <p>Yet I could never share the view that the farmer was a middle-class martyr. Evidence made it plain that he had deliberately shot the burglar dead while he was attempting to flee. He faced no plausible threat to his own safety. How can the law not uphold the sanctity of human life, even that of a professional criminal? </p> <p>It is hard to see a rational basis for the current campaign for new legislation, to allow householders to use more force in defending their property. What seems needed is a more sensitive approach by the authorities towards the predicament of people living in the countryside who suffer from crime. </p> <p>Everybody has his or her horror story, and few report an effective police response. Some middle-aged friends of ours were visited a few years ago in their remote house by a gang who tied them up and tortured them for some hours, to persuade them to disclose the whereabouts of non-existent valuables and cash. Psychologically, the couple have never recovered from the ordeal. </p> <p>In recent months there has been a string of big country-house burglaries in our area, for which the suspects are well-known, but no successful prosecutions have yet resulted. The farmyard behind our own home was recently stripped of an assortment of power tools, a common form of petty larceny. So what, you may say? Yet if people live alone, some distance from other habitations, and especially if they are elderly, fear becomes very real. If attacked in the country, people can shout their heads off for aid without hope of being heard. Rural dwellers really are on their own. Once a local attack has taken place, the familiar, precious sense of security in one's own home is hard to maintain. </p> <p> A s alarm systems become commonplace, more and more rural crimes are deliberately undertaken when premises are known to be occupied, and thus alarms are switched off. An elderly couple near us were visited recently by two men posing as meter readers, who beat them severely before making off with their pitiful spoils. There seems a good case for awarding an exceptional sentence to any criminal who knowingly targets the old. </p> <p>I do not want to exaggerate, to suggest that a reign of terror has seized rural Britain. National burglary statistics show a decline. Yet in the countryside, the increasing willingness of intruders to assault occupied houses is much more disturbing than a risk of the place being ransacked when it is empty. </p> <p>Judicial verdicts over recent years in cases where residents have tangled with intruders suggest that the balance of police and court sympathy has tilted too sharply in favour of the criminal, too strongly against the householder. Today we need not new law, but simply more wisdom and sympathy from police and judges. </p> <p>It is not necessary to be a rabid rightwinger to feel disgusted by instances in which illegal intruders have invoked civil law against the owners of premises they have wilfully invaded. Legal institutions command public respect only when they are seen to strike a proper mean between the law-abiding citizen and the criminal. </p> <p>It is the apparent loss of that mean which has done such harm to the relationship between police and the middle class in recent years. When the CPS investigates an attempted burglary in which a householder has used violence against the suspect, prosecutors seem to treat both as morally indistinguishable putative criminal offences. This must be wrong. </p> <p>Judge Andrew Hamilton's remarks in this week's burglary case deserve applause not because they promise country dwellers an open season on burglars, which they do not and should not, but because they take a step towards restoring a sensible balance. I do not expect the law to offer me a right to kill a burglar, but I want its agents to display a modest prejudice in my favour if I resist. If such prejudice is lacking, then so will be public respect for justice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The world's biggest porn baron rolled his gold-plated wheelchair through the centre of Birmingham yesterday to open Hustler Hollywood, the first British branch of his chain of sex shops. <p>Larry Flynt, the founder of the pornographic magazine Hustler, was greeted by a couple of hundred bemused onlookers and a dozen barely dressed models as he emerged from a black limousine to cut a ribbon and open the erotic emporium.</p> <p>The man who styles himself a \"smut peddler\" said that with the fuss surrounding the opening of the store, \"you'd think it's like I was trying to open a brothel\".</p> <p>The two-storey shop sells sex toys, lingerie, body oils, scented candles and other passion prompters under the banner: \"Relax, it's only sex\".</p> <p>There is a chair that tilts at the right angle for stim-ulation and a cafe offering \"throbbing paninis\" and lattes for the shopper who needs another kind of desire satisfied.</p> <p>Dressed in a velour pant suit, Mr Flynt, who is not in good health, told the crowd that he did not think sex in Britain was that different from in America. \"I hope Britons will withhold judgment on this store until they come in and see that it is a fun place to shop,\" he said.</p> <p>The multi-millionaire said there was, however, one key difference between the two countries: the law. He is not allowed to stock some of the hardcore magazines and videos that he can sell in the US. \"The store won't be stocking any item which is seen to be a violation of British laws,\" he said.</p> <p>But he added that people in the UK needed to \"open up\" and have a \"battle with the authorities\" so that they could buy what they wanted.</p> <p>Mr Flynt's Hustler empire, which includes nightclubs, casinos and a sex-shop website, is the sixth biggest private company in the US.</p> <p>It began with the magazine, Hustler, a hardcore publication aimed at appealing to blue-collar tastes.</p> <p>Always controversial, Mr Flynt objected to being told he treated women like meat by using a picture of a naked model being fed into a mincer on the cover.</p> <p>He was paralysed after being shot by an extremist who objected to a centrefold spread of a mixed-race couple, and later became an unlikely liberal cause celebre in the US when he challenged obscenity laws on the basis of free speech.</p> <p>His five-year legal battle with the evangelist Jerry Falwell ended in a victory in the supreme court.</p> <p>Such events, as well as his former drug addiction and four prison terms, were docu mented in the movie The People vs Larry Flynt, with Woody Harrelson in the starring role.</p> <p>Mr Flynt's campaigning side came out in Birmingham when he signed copies of his recently published third book Sex, Lies and Politics - The Naked Truth, a critique of the Bush administration. He said: \"Pornography is my business, politics is my hobby.\"</p> <p>There are plans for Hustler Hollywood shops across the country.</p> <p>They are run by Mr Flynt's daughter, Theresa Flynt-Gaerke. He once told her: \"Here's the money. Here's the location. I want a store where a teacher can feel comfortable. I want her to be able to come in and buy what she needs.\"</p> <p>Hustler Hollywood is on licence to the UK businessman Andrew Joseph.</p> <p>Yesterday in the shop, just across the road from Marks &amp; Spencer, staff predicted that aside from the Hustler T-shirts and tracksuits worn by stars such as Britney Spears, Geri Halliwell and Sara Cox, their biggest seller was likely to be the TriGasm vibrator, the most popular sex toy in the US.</p> <p>As the name suggest, it goes for three spots, and sells for \u00a399.99.</p>",
  "<p>Just a couple of months ago it was revealed that ministers are considering launching a state run equity release scheme to help boost pensioners' incomes. Now it emerges that new legislation aimed at pulling the plug on inheritance tax loopholes, could force those that release money tied up in their homes to pay income tax on the proceeds. </p> <p>The main aim of the \"pre-owned asset\" legislation, introduced in this year's Finance Bill and which comes into effect next April, is to clamp down on tax avoidance schemes that circumvent the Gift with Reservation (GWR) rules dating back to 1986. These were intended to ensure that if anyone gave away their assets to reduce inheritance tax on their estate but still enjoyed the practical benefits - by, for instance, continuing to live in the home they'd given away - then those assets would still be treated as part of the estate for tax purposes. </p> <p>But since they were introduced, numerous schemes have been devised to get round the rules. Some have already been blocked by new legislation that the Revenue was forced to introduce after losing legal challenges to close them down. </p> <p>The main focus of the new legislation is home loan plans, also known as double trust or main residence schemes. You sell your home, or your share of it, at full market value, to a trust in return for an IOU which you then give to a second trust set up for your beneficiaries. </p> <p>As the beneficiary of the first trust you're able to continue to live rent-free in your home. And by creating a debt against your estate equal to the value of your home, provided you survive for the next seven years, your beneficiaries won't have to pay any IHT on that amount. But instead of tightening the rules to bring such schemes within the scope of IHT, this time the government will be imposing a new income tax charge on the benefits anyone enjoys when continuing to have free use of an asset they once owned. </p> <p>And it will apply to any schemes set up since 1986 unless they're dismantled. Where the asset is their home, the annual tax charge will be based on the open market rent for the property. </p> <p>It is this switch to imposing an income tax charge on the rental value of a property given away that could potentially hit elderly homeowners who've released equity in their home while continuing to live there, even though they were only doing so to boost their income. An added irony is that it would only affect one of the two main types of equity release schemes. </p> <p>Those under threat are homeowners who sign up for a home reversion scheme where they sell part of their property for an agreed amount in return for tax free cash. They continue to live there until they sell, move home or die, when the scheme provider then takes its share and of any increase in the value of the property. </p> <p>Not caught in the new income tax trap are lifetime mortgages which provide a lump sum or monthly income from a loan taken out on the capital value of the property with the rolled up interest and capital not repaid until the owner either sells or dies, while still living there. </p> <p>Concerns that pensioners who sign up for a home reversion scheme, or have already released equity through this route, could be hit by the new income tax on pre-owned assets have been raised during consultation on the new legislation which ends on November 18. </p> <p>Numerous amendments have been made to the rules which will now exclude some schemes which IHT specialists had feared would be caught in the tax trap. But the Revenue has so far made no specific exemption for equity release schemes. </p> <p>Though specialist lawyers and barristers don't believe that home reversion schemes were an intended target of the new legislation, they still argue that there needs to be a specific ammendment to exclude them. </p> <p>The revenue dismisses these concerns as \"pure scaremongering\", and the suggestion that tens of thousands of people will be \"accidentally hit\" as \"self-evidently nonsense\". </p> <p>As it has repeatedly argued, it emphasises that the legislation is designed \"solely to tackle people using contrived, complex schemes drawn up by expensive tax advisers to avoid tax\". </p> <p>As a result, it now says that \"there is no question of legitimate equity release schemes that are not about avoiding tax being targeted\". </p> <p>Even so, this is unlikely to be enough to allay the fears of vulnerable pensioners. Added to which, some financial advisers have recently been promoting equity release as a vehicle for reducing exposure to IHT which could in the future prompt the Revenue to consider them to be tax avoidance. </p> <p>The key problem is that, instead of simply tightening the existing GWR rules, the government has opted for a catch-all approach. Not surprising, given its track record in the courts. But the down-side is the lack of detail on precisely which schemes will be affected, with the in-built threat that those, like home reversion - never set up to give away assets to mitigate IHT, could be hit.</p>",
  "Consumer credit rules will go some way to stopping lenders selling expensive loans to people on low incomes from Monday, credit law experts said yesterday after a court ruling released a Merseyside family from \u00a3380,000 of spiralling debts. <p>Tony and Michelle Meadows borrowed \u00a35,750 in 1989 to make improvements to their semi-detached house in Southport. But they struggled to make repayments and faced losing their \u00a3200,000 house to pay the debt. </p> <p>Judge Nigel Howarth at Liverpool county court said the combination of a high interest rate, legal fees, insurance costs and compound interest made the agreement \"extortionate\". </p> <p>He prevented London North Securities, which had purchased the debt from Home Loans Northern, from recovering any of the Meadow's assets. </p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry, after pressure from consumer groups, has brought in rules to help prevent people with poor credit records from being charged sky high rates. </p> <p>Lenders will be forced to advertise rates of interest that are offered to at least two thirds of those who apply for a loan. At the moment lenders need only offer half of applicants the headline rate. </p> <p>Lenders will also be prevented from preying on customers who have \"impaired\" credit records, including county court judgements. They will need to offer the \"typical\" interest rate rather than trap them into rates double or even treble the average. </p> <p>A spokesman for Citizens Advice said the number of people inquiring about debt problems had risen by 70% in the past decade to 700,000 a year. \"These new rules will add a degree of transparency and will wake up customers to the debts they are taking on,\" he said, but added: \"It doesn't go the whole way because it still relies on people knowing how APRs work.\" </p> <p>The National Consumer Council (NCC) said the case highlighted the irresponsible practices of many lenders who targeted people in financial difficulty. It said daytime TV channels and tabloid newspapers were an important vehicle for this kind of advertising. </p> <p>Claire Whyley, the deputy director of policy at the NCC, said: \"It is totally irresponsible to market secured loans as an easy way to borrow - especially when bundling together several small unsecured loans. </p> <p>\"New consumer credit laws are in the pipeline and NCC hopes they'll bring tighter rules on advertising and marketing, improved methods of checking borrowers' ability to pay, and a much fairer treatment of people in arrears.\" </p> <p>The Meadows were already in arrears on their mortgage when they took out their loan, which had an annual percentage rate of 34.9% repayable over 15 years.</p>",
  "<p>Financial writers should know better when it comes to what lurks in the small print of loans. But, like doctors who smoke, driving instructors who break the speed limit and vets who end up get bitten by angry cats and dogs, not all so-called professionals take their own advice. </p> <p>As a full-time freelance journalist I'm used to writing for cash-strapped and spent-out twenty and thirty something women, so I should really have read the small print when I had to replace a laptop in February this year. </p> <p>Smarting from a recent large tax bill my only choice was to take up PC World's offer of store credit. I ended up buying a \u00a31,299 laptop plus a \u00a3200 iPod plus a \u00a3499 insurance package, a total of \u00a32,052.99. I agreed to repay this back at \u00a370 back each month over a period of three years. </p> <p>The store assistant told me that I would not have to pay any interest if I paid the total back within a year. I cringe when I think of it now, but I did not even check the interest rate, or what the small print said about this 'interest-free' offer. I was determined to pay back the full amount within the year, so it didn't really matter what the rate was. </p> <p>Seven months later, with a new job and some spare cash in hand I made the sensible decision to clear my laptop debt, which I had reckoned at that stage to be just over \u00a31,500. </p> <p>It wasn't. HFC Bank, which operates PC World's store credit, informed me I still owed \u00a32,000. I asked what had happened to the interest free deal but HFC Bank told me there had been no such option and that in seven months I had already racked up nearly \u00a3500 interest. </p> <p>So, I called the store, only to be told to go away and read the small print. It was my word against the sales assistant's. There was nothing I could do except pay up. I decided to pay what I felt I owed, \u00a31,500, and argue about the interest with PC World later. </p> <p>But when I called HFC Bank back to make the payment I was informed I would have to pay another \u00a3800 interest. Even more shocking, and only after I insisted on the information, I was told that if I kept the loan running for the full three years I would have to pay an extra \u00a31,319.01 in interest alone. This brought the cost of my laptop - now worth a sickening \u00a3700 on the Apple Store website - to over \u00a33,000. </p> <p>According to PC World it was my fault for not reading the small print. PC World maintains that it was I who made the mistake. </p> <p>But after a lot of discussion, it has now agreed to refund my interest as a gesture of goodwill. Gina Jones at PC World said: \"All our sales assistants are fully trained and informed about credit, we have been selling goods with very few complaints for years.\" </p> <p>So how can you avoid making the mistakes I did? Well it's probably best to avoid store credit altogether. </p> <p>If you are going to borrow a sum of more than \u00a31,000 look around for a loan or a zero per cent credit card as their interest rates are on average nine times cheaper according to the Consumer's Association. </p> <p>Last year a CA report found that someone borrowing \u00a35,000 over three years using an in-store credit deal at 30% would pay just over \u00a32,000 in interest compared to \u00a3540 for a similar loan of 7%. </p> <p>In-store credit deals and store cards are the most expensive ways to borrow. Beware of anything offering a zero per cent period at the start of the loan because if you do not pay the loan back within the interest-free period, normally around 12 months, you end up paying interest back to the day the loan started. </p> <p>Always check the rate you see advertised is the rate you get - sometimes it is the lowest rate that is advertised in the store. Make sure you know how the interest is being calculated, mine was calculated monthly, so in effect I ended up paying 19% of the total loan each year. </p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading admitted that when it comes to any type of credit there is no substitute for reading the small print. </p> <p>\"If someone mentions an interest free credit deal get it down in writing,\" said Roger Hislop of the OFT. Shoppers should not take anything for granted. \"If something is said verbally it could be part of the legally binding arrangement but proving it could be a problem and deals do change.\" </p> <p>The OFT also recommends that you get any promises in writing, and above all get the store to explain how the interest works.</p>",
  "<p>It was exactly 12 months ago that I first began looking for an investment property to buy in Oxford, but under the present circumstances - after five interest rate rises and increasingly grim news about house prices - I would not have the guts to do anything similar today. </p> <p>It is chilling to remember how quickly, and how optimistically, I made such a big purchase this time last year. But the deed was done in May and the tenants are still in the flat, despite a continuing problem with damp in the plaster. </p> <p> The builder assures me that it is normal for it to take up to 12 months to dry completely, and generously contributed a big dehumidifier to help, but the dreadful summer weather has been like a wet blanket - both literally and metaphorically. The tenants are taking it in their stride, but a rent increase is right out for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>In addition, a strange shadow has appeared on one of the bedroom walls - not in the shape of anything commercially useful, like the face of Jesus, but in the shape of a giant moth. It is very symmetrical and mysterious, unrelated to the position of any of the pipe work or drainage, and reappears through the new layers of paint that have been applied. The builder is stumped, the tenants bemused. </p> <p>Lately I've been investigating some other mysterious phenomena, such as how it is possible to spend \u00a3900 on waste bins for 10 flats. I received my first statement of charges from the management company, which showed that I paid 12 months of fees as part of the completion transaction, despite taking possession of the flat four months into the year. I had several questions, among them: </p> <p>Are they buying the bins from Harrods? </p> <p>Will I get a refund on the service charges relating to the first four months of the year, when I did not own the flat? </p> <p>What happened to the plan of paying monthly for the service charge (my preferred option)? </p> <p>The answers were 'no', 'no', and 'you didn't tell us'. It turns out that any overpayment of the service charges, when compared to the actual spend on maintenance, is carried over into the next year. </p> <p>At no point was I offered the choice of paying monthly, (an option specified in the lease), and the day of completion was such a chaotic mess that I overlooked it then. Another lesson learned: I will be paying monthly next year. My view is that the money will be cosier in my bank account than in the management company's \"sink fund\". </p> <p>And just to make life really interesting, I have rented out my own house, so I am now managing two rental properties 40 miles away from where I live. Initially I used two letting agents on either side of Oxford, including the one who produced the tenants for my flat. </p> <p>But after several weeks of viewings but no bookings, and the dead winter season approaching, we parted. No money changed hands, although they had both advertised the property more than once. I placed an advert on a free website which produced two nice young women sharers, saving myself \u00a3500 in fees. </p> <p>But this small saving was quickly offset by bigger expenditures, in another example of what I am coming to think of as Vanessa's Law. When I informed my lender, Nottingham Building Society, that I had let the property that I had been living in and was letting it out, they levied an extra 1% of interest and an \u00a380 \"administration fee\". </p> <p>The fun started in earnest when I tried to obtain landlord's contents insurance on both properties. I tried five insurers before I found a broker, Household Insurance Services, which could insure the contents in a let property, but they helpfully explained that it would be much cheaper to insure the contents through the buildings insurance provider. </p> <p>In a flash of inspiration, I phoned NFU Mutual, who provide the buildings insurance on the buy-to-let flat, for which I pay a share through the management company. </p> <p>I explained that I was the landlord of one of the units, and was told by the nice young man that I could not benefit by insuring the contents with them because the policy was in the developer's name. </p> <p>Never mind, I said, quote me miserable then. First the nice young man was required to give me the full rendition of the company's terms and conditions, the FSA regulations, and the names and hobbies of the managing director's children, lasting around five minutes. At the end of which, there was this exchange: </p> <p>Me: You do realise that the property is let? </p> <p>NFU: Uh, sorry, we don't do landlord's contents insurance. </p> <p>Back to Household Insurance Services. Since I could not purchase new buildings insurance for the flat, the minimum insurable value of the contents was a whopping \u00a312,000. This was for an unfurnished, one-bedroom flat, in which my only possessions include carpets, curtains and white goods. </p> <p>Still, at \u00a3104, the premium seems a bargain for that! But after buying new buildings insurance for the house, in order to get the contents insurance cheaper, I am \u00a3300 worse off in total. </p> <p>After five months of landladyship, my balance sheet remains static.

  "<p>London Underground this week confirmed that cash machines at its stations across the capital have been hit with highly sophisticated \"skimming\" devices which steal card details and enable crooks to plunder accounts. </p> <p>Photos have been taken by staff of a Barclays machine at Hammersmith station and emailed as a warning to workers across the tube network. The first picture shows how the ATM normally looks. The second, how a carefully manufactured cloning device was placed over the card entry point, using double-sided tape. London Underground spokesman Stuart Ross says: \"We have had reports over the last week of such devices appearing on machines across the Underground, and not just on Barclay's machines. We have not had this problem before and we wanted to alert managers to the danger.\" </p> <p>In the past, skimming devices have been relatively clunky and unsophisticated. But even the most frequent ATM user would be fooled by the skill with which crooks have made devices which nearly perfectly match the colour and materials used on a standard ATM. </p> <p>It is not clear how many users have fallen victim, although banks say that ATM fraud cost them around \u00a340m last year, up from just \u00a38m six years ago. </p> <p>This device in Hammersmith was a computerised \"card reader\" of the type able to siphon thousands of pounds from bank accounts. It scans and stores the personal bank details contained on the magnetic strip. </p> <p>Police say these cloning devices usually come with a pinhole camera. The device records the user's card details, while the camera films the PIN number. Once the crooks have the card details, it is relatively easy to produce a cloned copy of the card which can access money from individual bank accounts. Police say cloned cash cards can be ready for use within an hour of details being obtained. The beauty of the crime is individuals are unaware that their card has been copied and that thousands of pounds may be disappearing from accounts. </p> <p>Banks have to return the cash to customers unless they can prove the individual has been negligent. But the immediate impact on individuals left without access to cash can be devastating. Banks do not return the money until after they have carried out a fraud investigation, which can take six weeks. </p> <p>Barclays said this week from next week it is trialling a new anti-skimming device which will run over 100 of its ATMs and, if successful, will be rolled out to its entire network of 2,600 cash machines. </p> <p>Understandably, it does not want to reveal details of how the technology will work but it is confident it will defeat every skimming device its experts have yet seen. </p> <p>Barnaby Davis, head of ATMs at Barclays says: \"As ATM fraud is across the industry, we have been working hard to stay one step ahead of the criminals. For example, Barclays is currently trialling new anti-skimming devices which prevents fraudsters from attaching their own devices, such as the one shown in the London Underground internal memo, on to our machines. </p> <p>\"Our advice to people is to always stay vigilant when withdrawing money. There are a number of simple things consumers can do to protect themselves, such as shield their pin number from others and alert the police if they think the ATM they are using has been tampered with. Consumers should also regularly check their statements to detect signs of fraud early on, at which point they should let their banks know immediately.\" </p> <p>The surge in card cloning at cash machines earlier this year prompted one bank, First Direct, to advise its customers to use ATMs as little as possible. </p> <p>But others say that the alternative to frequent ATM use - carrying around huge amounts of cash in one's wallet - is even more dangerous. If you are mugged for your wallet, you won't receive your cash back, but if your card is cloned, your money will eventually be returned. The Association of Payment Clearing Services insists that although hole-in-the-wall fraud is increasing, the chances of it happening to you are still remote. </p> <p>It adds that chip and Pin cards, which have an electronic chip which is very difficult to replicate, will hinder criminals using cloned cards at an ATM. </p> <p>But security analysts argue that even new chip and Pin cards have a magnetic strip which can be copied, and that the chip reader in ATMs can be disabled. The machine then reverts to reading the magnetic strip and dispenses the cash. </p> <p><strong>Warning signs</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If there is anything unusual about your machine or it looks like it has been tampered with them then don't use it. Contact the bank/police immediately. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Do not attempt to remove the fraudsters' equipment </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Be aware of your surroundings, if someone is crowding or watching you cancel the transaction and go to another cash machine. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Do not accept help from well meaning strangers and never allow yourself to be distracted. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If your cash machine does not return your card then report it loss to your bank/police immediately.</p>",
  "<p>We might have better pay, fewer fears about job losses and there might even be signs that we're working fewer hours - but we're still getting less job satisfaction. A major survey has tracked levels of satisfaction in our working lives and found a steady decline in how much we're enjoying our jobs. </p> <p>And the two chief reasons for our dissatisfaction are a sense that we have less control over our daily tasks and a growing perception that the workload has grown to make each day more pressurised. </p> <p>Francis Green, professor of economics at the University of Kent, says that there has been a significant downturn in job satisfaction since the early 1990s. The number of people who rated their job \"very\" or \"completely\" satisfying has fallen by 10 percentage points across the decade. </p> <p>This was a puzzling finding - as this period has seen rising wage levels and an increasingly buoyant labour market. If there was more choice of jobs and more money, why were we feeling more miserable about going to work? </p> <p>\"People are dissatisfied with the work itself,\" says Professor Green. \"It's not about the financial rewards, but the day to day experience of how we carry out work tasks. </p> <p>\"People feel that they have to work harder - not just longer hours, but more intensively. They feel they are on the go all day and that contributes to more stress. And they are recording that they have less control and autonomy over their daily tasks. There are more targets, more rules, less trust.\" </p> <p>Even if people are working hard, they don't mind if they feel they are making decisions about how they work, he says. But to have a heavy workload plus little flexibility is the worst of both worlds. </p> <p>\"These factors interact. Workers are especially susceptible to stress and unhappiness in situations where they are both pushed to work very hard and have very little control over what they have to do.\" </p> <p>Many blue collar production line workers have always worked in a routine with little scope for their own decision making. But Professor Green says that this is now becoming a bigger issue for the professional classes. </p> <p>For instance, in the public sector, in education and health, workers are under much more pressure to meet targets and to be more accountable for how they perform. He says: \"The consequence could be a high staff turnover. Disgruntled workers are more likely to leave and there's a strong correlation between dissatisfaction and high turnover.\" </p> <p>And such unhappiness is likely to go hand in hand with other problems such as sick leave and absenteeism. </p> <p>This view of work becoming more restrictive isn't about nostalgia, says Professor Green. These are observations which have been tracked since the early 1990s - and the research findings on the sense of people's lack of control over their work are \"very robust\". </p> <p>The research is based on surveys asking questions about job satisfaction to representative samples of workers across Britain - between 2,500 to 4,500 people - and monitoring how the responses have changed. </p> <p>These are asked anonymously and at people's homes, so that they don't feel under pressure to sound positive. And there are also psychological surveys to track levels of \"work strain\". </p> <p>But the surveys show that happiness and unhappiness are not necessarily evenly spread. Women are much more satisfied with their working lives than men. This is despite the evidence that they are earning less than their male counterparts - with the trade and industry secretary saying this week that women still faced \"career sexism\". </p> <p>No-one is really sure why women should enjoy their work more - with no objective reason for the difference. \"It's one of the puzzles of social science at the moment,\" he says. </p> <p>There are suggestions that women are more pragmatic in what they expect to get from work, so less likely to feel disappointed - or else that women returning after being at home with children enjoy the social aspects of going back to work. There are also age differences, with people in their thirties the most likely to be dissatisfied. While people in their fifties register the highest sense of being happy in their work. </p> <p>This suggests a picture of people in their thirties who are feeling stuck in a rut, or thwarted in their ambition. And that by they reach their fifties, they will either have shifted priorities away from work, reconciled themselves to their jobs, or else, Professor Green suggests, dropped out of the workforce altogether. </p> <p>This makes men in their thirties the most disillusioned in the workforce. But they shouldn't expect any empathy from the boss, because high status in the workplace is also likely to be matched by an irritatingly smug sense of high job satisfaction. </p> <p>These miserable men in their thirties are also likely to be bearing the brunt of working anti-social hours, as the survey provides a fresh perspective on the whole question of the \"long hours culture\". </p> <p>There has been recent evidence claiming that despite the publicity about \"burn-out Britain\" we're not really working longer and longer hours. The Centre for Economics and Business Research published findings this month saying that we're working fewer hours. </p> <p>Pushing in the other direction, the TUC says that we're still enjoying too few bank holidays in this country, needing three more a year to bring us up to the European Union average, and that increasing holidays will make us happier without damaging productivity. </p> <p>But the University of Kent research says that average working hours can be a misleading guide - and that it is the intensity, rather than volume of work, that creates the problems associated with overload. </p> <p>As an overall average, working hours are going slightly down, says Professor Green. But this masks big local differences, with men in particular working very long hours, and some two-income households having both men and women working long hours. </p> <p>These extreme concentrations of long hours are a particular problem, and distort the average, but it's no longer true to say that \"people in Britain work more hours than anywhere else in Europe\", he says. </p> <p>What is more pernicious is an unsustainable level of pressure - and he points to teaching as an example - here the government was forced to introduce a plan to reduce workload. There have been other surveys that have highlighted examples of this dissatisfaction. </p> <p>According to the vocational qualifications body, City and Guilds, there are millions of people with unrequited passions for a different job. It published a survey this summer claiming that a third of workers would like to change their career, such as bored office workers wanting to get out from their desks and find outdoor jobs. </p> <p>And echoing the University of Kent findings about depressed thirtysomethings, the City and Guilds survey found that almost half of professional staff who had been in their jobs for a decade wanted to leave. </p> <p>But it's not all gloom. Even though a growing number of us are less satisfied, these are trends against a bigger picture in which a majority of people are at least \"fairly satisfied\" with their work. And only a relative handful of people say they are completely dissatisfied. </p> <p>The survey also debunks the idea that we're all suffering from an endemic sense of job insecurity, with no evidence to support the idea that the end of the \"job for life\" has undermined satisfaction in our work. </p> <p>There are also positive steps that can be taken to improve people's experience of work. Jane Sullivan, of the Work Foundation, says that the advance of flexible working, in terms of where and when people work, can give people back a greater sense of control. </p> <p>If employers want to recruit the right staff, they need to offer the right kind of working conditions - and increasingly this means flexibility. And she says that the factors which could be used to constrain staff, could also be used in a more positive way to give them a greater sense of independence. </p> <p>For instance, technology could be used as part of a highly-monitored, restrictive work environment, where processes are automated and actions scripted. Or else technology might be used by \"knowledge workers\" as a way of gaining more freedom over working hours. </p> <p>Which suggests that if you're in a high-skill, innovative business, you'll be reaping the benefits; while if you're stuck at the other end of the employment scale, you'll be paying the price. </p> <p>Job satisfaction can be a difficult and transient feeling to define, she says, and might be different from day to day. But \"research shows that if an employer has a committed and engaged workforce it pays dividends,\" she says. </p> <p>Professor Green also has suggestions for how to improve workplace satisfaction. \"If we're required to carry out a task, without any influence over the process, then we may as well be a machine. Every task needs to have an element of personal discretion, it's fundamental to job satisfaction.\" </p> <p>He says that a solution to this could be for jobs to be re-designed to deliberately include greater control for the person carrying out a task, with such decisions using contributions from the shopfloor. </p> <p>And he says that as well as looking at pay and conditions, trade unions should \"concentrate their effort on defending their members' quality of work\". </p> <p>International comparisons show that there is nothing inevitable about moving to a more restrictive, less satisfying way of working, he says. Professor Green cites Finland as a place where an opposite course has been taken. </p> <p>But he warns that at present we're failing to take advantage of the potential benefits of our collective wealth. \"One of the paradoxes is that we live in an affluent age - we're much more affluent than 30 or even 10 years ago. And so we should feel quite lucky, compared for instance to the United States where workers are not much better off. </p> <p>\"But we don't seem to be taking that affluence and buying ourselves a better quality of working life.\" </p> <p>And, finally, if you're a bloke in his thirties who feels he is working too many hours, then at least it's the weekend.</p>",
  "<p>If Jobs &amp; Money readers are anything to go by, nothing seems to anger consumers more than unavailable offers. You spot an advertisement for a loan or a credit card, offering what looks a great rate, but when you get your approval notice, you're put on to a far more expensive loan. </p> <p>Increasing numbers of lenders are now making offers according to your ability to pay. Only those with the best credit records are getting the headline rate - the rest are put on an APR that can be as much as twice as the figure quoted in the advert. </p> <p>However, this is all about to change. An update to the consumer credit law that comes into force on October 31 demands that personal loan providers must offer the advertised rate to at least two-thirds (67%) of successful applicants. At the moment, they are only required to give it to 51%. </p> <p>This will have a big effect on the way such companies offer loans. In particular, it could force several lenders to up their advertised rates to reflect the changes. </p> <p>And one industry commentator is already predicting that consumers will come under renewed pressure to take out expensive payment protection policies as the lenders seek to generate their revenue streams elsewhere. </p> <p>You may not know it, but if you're borrowing money, you've never had it so good. Interest rates or APRs charged by loan companies have never been closer to the Bank of England's base rates - for the first time ever banks and building societies are offering APR rates that are less than 1% over base. </p> <p>Richard Mason, director of personal loans at <a href=\"http://www.moneysupermarket.com\">moneysupermarket.com</a> says he has never seen so many lenders battling to get market share. </p> <p>\"At present, there are five personal loan providers with rates under 6%, with Northern Rock leading the way at 5.6% APR. With the base rate at 4.75% and expectations that there will be a rise at least once more before the end of the year, these are \"typical rates\" that defy logic. </p> <p>\"The new two-thirds rule is a welcome move and is one that helps consumers to be confident they are more likely to get the rate they have applied for. However, it is also bound to add pressure on lenders to raise rates that already look unsustainably low. </p> <p>Tim Sawyer, head of Abbey's internet banking arm Cahoot, agrees that the changes could put pressure on some loan providers to increase rates. </p> <p>\"At Cahoot we aim to offer around 80% of applicants the advertised rates so the new rules will not impact on our business. That said, I can see plenty of others who do play the numbers games having to change their advertised rates to meet the two-thirds rule,\" he says. </p> <p>\"One other likely impact of the changes will be that more applications will simply be refused. Some credit card providers are increasing adopting this stance - they'll decline the application for the 6.7% APR, but offer a completely different card charging 11.9% instead.\" </p> <p> One factor that may keep loan rates down is the intense competition in the market place. Earlier this week the British Bankers' Association reported that the number of new mortgage applications is now at its lowest level for three years. With the housing market slumping round the country lenders are chasing a shrinking market. </p> <p>Lloyd East, director of AA loans, is one person who believes that competition will more than offset any upward pressure on rates. </p> <p>\"The cost of borrowing has been consistently falling over the past two or three years and we don't believe the change to two-thirds of applicants getting the advertised rate will force an upward pressure on APRs. The AA doesn't anticipate any difficulty in meeting the new obligations,\" he said. </p> <p>But one thing the low cost of borrowing does, says Richard Mason, is to force lenders to seek alternative sources of income. \"I feel that consumers are going to come under increased pressure to take out payment protection insurance. With rates so low, the lenders only need 1% of borrowers to default and their profits will disappear. PPI is very profitable source of income for the banks - 80% of the cost of the policy is straight commission. </p> <p>\"When I worked for one of the big banks several years ago, I was told to ring up people who had applied for loans and tell them it had been held up for a few days because there was no protection insurance in place. As soon as we said it could proceed immediately if the customer bought a policy costing just 30p a day, three-quarters took it out.\" </p> <p>PPI is expensive and often riddled with get-out clauses. Basically, it's of very little value to those who don't need - those with strong job security - but it rarely pays out for those who really need it, such as the self-employed.</p>",

  "<p>Though the world of work may seem light years away, the reality for final year students is that in less than 30 weeks, university life will be over and finding a job will be their major preoccupation. The most 'switched on' students will already be focused on meeting this year's graduate programme application deadlines. However in a recent survey, more than 32% of final year students and recent graduates were blissfully unaware of these looming deadlines - cut-off dates that might mean the difference between joining a career boosting, well paid graduate programme of their choice - or settling for an unplanned gap year. </p> <p>But help is at hand. Next week's National Graduate Recruitment Exhibition, taking place at the NEC, Birmingham on November 5 and November 6 (<a href=\"http://www.gradjobs.co.uk\">www.gradjobs.co.uk</a>), is an opportunity for students to swot up on the application procedures for more than 100 employers. </p> <p>\"The event is a real opportunity for finalists to meet employers and gain an indication of the job market for next summer,\" says Steve Thompson, senior careers adviser at Aston University Careers Service, which is offering advice at the fair. \"It should help students to focus on what they should be doing now to obtain positions after graduation.\" </p> <p>But turning up at the graduate recruitment fair will be only the start.

Review your notes from the fair and evaluate what you think went well and what you can improve for the next recruitment fair or interview. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 2: Write notes on each employer that interests you and target five or six employers for immediate follow up. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 3: Do some thorough library and internet research on your targeted companies. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 4: Visit or ring your careers office and ask for intelligence on your chosen employers. Are there any alumni working at these companies? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 5: Write a professional thank you letter (\"thank you for coming to the fair and taking time to talk to me\" etc) to your targeted employers, adding any points you missed or that need to be emphasised. Make sure you address them to the people you met at the fair. Cite something specific from your discussion and include another CV, any application forms which you received at the fair or other materials you think might be relevant. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 6: Contact the alumni you found at the careers office and ask for an informal chat to help you get to know the company from a personal perspective. It may also uncover some informal networks that could assist your employment search. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 7: Take today off - you've earned it. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 8: Practise answers to job interview questions - you might need them tomorrow. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day 9: This is the big one. Call your contact at your targeted employers to make sure the company received your application materials and see if they need additional information.

  "<p>If you are a graduate with a sciencey background, and are looking for a postgrad course that's going to parachute you into a management career, read on: Rise has unearthed a little-known course that might fit the bill. The University of Bradford's school of management is offering a masters that should help you to move into one of the big growth areas for British commerce - quality and performance management. </p> <p>If you have a hatred of jargon, this is not the course for you as the syllabus is filled with it. In essence, this is a study of the science behind how companies and other organisations measure how well they are performing - particularly if they operate in an arena where it is not immediately apparent. </p> <p>The course, which has just started its second year, is being offered as a full-time programme at Bradford School of Management's European Centre for Total Quality Management (ECTQM). According to its director of studies, Mohamed Zairi, the MSc in total quality and performance management is the first of its kind in the world. </p> <p>\"There has, over the past couple of years, been a major shift from the general principles and fundamentals of TQM as a philosophy towards the measurement of its impact, the creation of sustainable competitive advantage through the adoption of quality as a strategic driver. </p> <p>\"Most organisations need to lift their chins and take a look at what's going on around them - quality and performance management is very popular in north America, and is set to take off on this side of the Atlantic,\" he says. The course is very much aimed at recent graduates, as well as those who have been working in the field. Mohamed says he is looking for those with a 2:2 or better and most students will have come from \"one of the measuring disciplines - the social sciences\". </p> <p>Quality assurance schemes such as the ISO 9002, and other benchmarking techniques are very much the order of the day - as you would expect, there is a great deal of research methodology. </p> <p>\"For those not quite up to speed when they arrive we operate a course that is similar to a mini MBA to get them up to the required level. I anticipate good job prospects for those completing the course - mostly within large corporations, and big public sector providers. </p> <p>\"We are already seeing a lot of interest from the manufacturing and the IT/telecoms sectors looking to define their strategic objectives and take the business forward in a measured way.\" </p> <p>There are 18 students on this year's course and the programme hopes to train 30 students a year eventually. It features a great deal of students from oversees, and the fees are a fairly frightening \u00a36,500 for home students. </p> <p>A distance-learning (e-learning) version is run from the eTQM College in Dubai and there are plans to introduce this mode to other parts of the world - including Hong Kong, China, Malaysia and Pakistan.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:miles.brignall@tiscali.fr\">miles.brignall@tiscali.fr</a></p>",
  "<p>Do you want to earn, learn, and travel? All at the same time? While still pulling together the sort of challenging experiences you can put on a CV and talk about at interview? If this combination sounds enticing, it might be worth looking at the various educational exchange schemes that are available to students and recent graduates. </p> <p>Next year, the British Council's Assistant Programme will be 100 years old, and as such it will have given generations of students and recent graduates their first real taste of a work-based challenge. Each year, approximately 1,800 teaching assistants are placed in 20 countries around the world, including most of Europe as well as Latin America, Canada, Russian and China. On average, an assistant is required to teach for 12 hours a week and receives a local salary. </p> <p>To be eligible for the programme you need to be between 20 and 30 years old, a native-level English speaker, to have completed secondary education in the UK, plus two years of higher education and have the resourcefulness to adapt to another culture. You also need at least an AS-level, Higher or equivalent in the language of the country you are applying for, although non-linguists can apply to teach in China. </p> <p>\"Of course it is a personal developmental challenge,\" says Joan Hoggan, language-assistants team leader at the British Council, \"and there are lots of obvious benefits to your language skills, to your confidence and independence, and to your inter-cultural awareness. </p> <p>\"However, one of the key things you take from the assistant programme is a cache of transferable skills. Having to work in a foreign country not only improves many of the competencies employers look for, it also gives you specific examples of each one that you can talk about at interview: for example problem-solving, negotiation, communication, presentation skills, motivation, and people management.\" </p> <p>A similar scheme is operated by the Japanese government. Known as the Japan Exchange and Teaching (Jet) programme, this scheme has UK graduates spending between one and three years working in the Japanese education system as assistant language teachers (ALTs) - although there are other positions available in local government for people with Japanese language skills. </p> <p>Pay is considered generous and accommodation is usually arranged through the programme. In order to apply to Jet, among other criteria you will need to hold a UK passport, have a bachelor's degree by July 2005 for next year's entry, and be no more than 39 years old by that date. </p> <p>Another way of getting abroad while you are still a student is through the Socrates-Erasmus programme. Erasmus, the European Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students, attracts about 10,000 UK students each year. </p> <p>Participants spend between three and 12 months studying at a European university and have their study formally acknowledged in their degree transcript. There is no pay as such, but grants are available, and there are no additional tuition costs to pay to the host institution. </p> <p>Here are ten top tips for making the most of working abroad: </p> <p>1. Try to find out as much as possible about the area you are going to before you leave, including where you may want to live and how to get around. </p> <p>2. Talk to people who have done the same thing to find out about their experiences. This will put you at ease and help with your expectations. </p> <p>3.

  "<p><strong> IOU: The Debt Threat and Why We Must Defuse It</strong><br> by Noreena Hertz<br> 288pp, Fourth Estate, \u00a316.99</p> <p>The recent history of sub-Saharan Africa is littered with tragedies, with one of the saddest cases being post-independence Zambia. In 1964, thanks to its abundant natural resources, Zambia was one of the wealthiest countries in the region. But since the mid-1970s its economy has been in steep descent. The appearance of the HIV/Aids epidemic heralded further decline, so that Zambia's national income of $1,455 per person in 1976 shrank to $892 by 2000, and the average lifespan fell from 44 years in 1990 to just 33 in 2003 - the lowest in the world. </p> <p>For much of this period Zambia received support from the international community. Yet almost every attempt to help made matters worse. Like a patient who baffles medical science, Zambia has been poked and prodded by experts from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, who prescribed repeated doses of shock treatment. The result has been worsening poverty and a dramatic buildup of foreign debt: from $814m in 1970 to nearly $7bn in 1990, a huge sum that Zambia could ill afford. </p> <p>It is that debt burden which concerns Noreena Hertz, and the way in which the international financial system penalises the weak and poor in places such as Zambia. While it is highly desirable that this issue be kept in the spotlight, what is disappointing about IOU is that it contains little that is new or radical. There is nothing here that will surprise readers of Susan George's 1988 book A Fate Worse than Debt, which remains the most forceful call for undoing the burden of the developing world. When celebrated economists such as Paul Krugman and Jagdish Baghwati argue along similar lines, and politicians such as Gordon Brown agree, then Hertz is pushing at an open door. Yet Hertz dismisses current debt-reduction plans as inadequate, and contends there is a risk of apocalyptic default that could undermine the world's finances, environment and political structures. </p> <p>Is she right? One problem is that Hertz paints the world in stark terms: there are no success stories in her book, only failures. Every developing country is a Zambia, every international intervention is hamfisted, and disaster is just around the corner. In doing so she risks overstating her case and misleading her readers in order to win them over. </p> <p>One example is Hertz's portrayal of the process that launched the \"Brady bonds\" debt relief in 1989, where the US underwrote a proportion of Latin America's sovereign debt overhang from the 1970s and 1980s. By Hertz's account, this was to ensure US investors got their money back while allowing the IMF and World Bank \"ever more intrusive control over their internal economic policies ... and so on\". The truth is somewhat different. The Brady-bond plan was in fact substantially devised by the Mexican government. The restructuring of Mexico's economy actually started several years before Brady bonds were launched, and began under the aegis of its then president, Miguel de la Madrid. The IMF and World Bank had little to do with it. </p> <p>If Hertz's analysis is stark, her proposed solutions are less well defined. Some of her suggestions are patronising - setting up panels of international \"overseers\" for aid funding is a bit rich given her diatribes against external IMF and World Bank meddling - while one is downright dangerous: that wealthy nations hypothecate the taxes paid by immigrant workers for use as overseas aid (so removing their last shield against the xenophobe or racist, that they too pay taxes for the NHS). </p> <p>Hertz's arguments might be more compelling if the book were not littered with errors. On page 152, for example, readers are told that Russia defaulted on its international debt in 1998, while on pages 146, 148 and 150 Russia's default is said to have occurred in 1999 (the default was in August 1998). Even poor Zambia gets mistreated by Hertz, who mangles a variety of dates and names. These are perhaps minor errors, but there are many others that smack of economic illiteracy and careless research. Readers may also be unimpressed with Hertz's informal prose style and strangled syntax. (One choice sentence reads: \"Again not good.\") The first chapter, especially, reads like a rejected screenplay for an unhappy episode of The West Wing. </p> <p>There is much to say on this subject, especially on the problems faced by the world's poor. It is deeply wrong that countries ravaged by Aids spend more on debt servicing than on healthcare. But to blame everything - from climate change and al-Qaida to (bizarrely) falling sugar maple yields - on debt, as Hertz does, is to lose perspective. While no one can doubt Hertz's good intentions, the road to hell is paved with books like IOU. Developing-world debt is a serious issue, and it deserves more judicious treatment than this. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Richard Adams is a leader-writer for the Guardian.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Mind the Gap: The New Class Divide in Britain </strong> <br>by Ferdinand Mount <br>320pp, Short Books, \u00a314.99</p> <p>In recent years, some of the most raging polemics against contemporary trends in global capitalism have been written by those who do not come from the left of the political spectrum. Now, to add to books such as John Gray's False Dawn and Edward Luttwak's Turbo-Capitalism , we have Ferdinand Mount's Mind the Gap. Mount, a former head of the No 10 Policy Unit under Mrs Thatcher, takes as his central thesis the view that \"the worst-off in this country live impoverished lives, more so than the worst-off on the Continent or in the United States... impoverished not simply in relation to the better-off in Britain today but in relation to their own parents and grandparents\". </p> <p>In breathless and sweeping style, Mount seeks to demolish the myth that Britain is becoming a more classless society, arguing that on any axis of equality - income, lifestyle or opportunity -we find ourselves as divided as ever. What really concerns him is the sense of a nation split between what he calls the Uppers and Downers, terms borrowed from HG Wells's The Time Machine . In Mount's usage, these are infinitely flexible class categorisations: \"What the Uppers are afraid of is the Downers. Just as Wells prophesied, the children of the light are afraid of the children of the dark and of the tribes who live in the dark.\" </p> <p>So Mount sees the working class, and in particular the underclass, as subject to a crude and one-sided portrayal in contemporary social discourse and media representation. And for him, it is part of a wider contempt that he perceives in the society, such that \"the ultimate deprivation that the English working class has suffered - in fact the consequence of all other deprivations - is the deprivation of respect\". That is the gap which Mount seems to mind. </p> <p>Unfortunately it is here, after what appears a promising opening, that his argument goes off the rails. In part, he succumbs to the stereotype about the working class with which he himself has just taken issue. And, predictably, he wishes to blame the state for the cultural deficit he sees. So he proceeds to a long and tedious discourse which faults government for having built the institutions of welfare capitalism, thereby destroying the friendly societies, private schools and other institutions that bound working-class communities together and fostered a sense of mutual aid and fraternity. Through council housing, the welfare state, the absence of tax incentives for marriage and the destruction of non-conformist religion, the state has robbed individuals of their independence. </p> <p>Of course, sensible progressives should accept that some postwar innovations, such as the construction of social housing, owed too much to mechanistic reform without democratic consultation with tenants. But Mount slides between this argument and a more traditional outright condemnation of the whole concept of welfare capitalism, ignoring the massive advances of the 1945 settlement and failing to explain how exactly, beyond urban myths, the welfare state is indeed the parent of cultural impoverishment. </p> <p>What is more, his critique of the state's role is undermined because he is candid enough to recognise that the nature of today's market institutions make the problems of inequality more, not less acute: \"For all the benefits that capitalism brings, its cold indifference remains hard to cope with, both in theory and practice... Full-blooded capitalism has certain natural tendencies which may make life for the poorest insecure and unnerving, even if it makes them richer in cash terms.\" </p> <p>Here is Mount's fundamental problem. Today's labour market does tend towards increasing inequality, among other reasons because it increasingly rewards the high skilled relative to the low skilled. But if this is true and the resulting inequality is a concern, then the only answer is to support a role for government in both opening up opportunity and leaning against these inequalities. Prewar friendly societies, mutual aid organisations and good works are not an answer. Mount's difficulty is that he spends part of the book attacking the institutions of the state, then bemoans the tendencies of the market, but he cannot square the circle. </p> <p>At times, this contradiction leads him to some pretty bizarre arguments. For instance, he claims that the state is responsible for increased inequality because of higher taxes on the poor to pay for welfare. Indeed, he says that the present government has increased taxes on the poor and that the real problem of the past seven years is that the \"Downers are overtaxed in a way they never used to be\". As a passing analysis of the statistics would have told him, he is just wrong. Direct tax and benefit measures since 1997 mean that families with children in the poorest one-fifth of the population are on average more than \u00a350 a week better off. Far from government measures increasing inequality, it is through discretionary action that its rise has been stemmed. </p> <p>What are his prescriptions to solve the problems of inequality that he sees? His main policy focus is described by the slogan \"unlock and allot\": giving land, housing, shares, as well as school and health vouchers to individuals, ensuring more accountable forms of collective control (such as over the police, and over companies through employee share ownership) and bolstering the role of religious organisations in welfare services. As he explains it: \"Our aim is to de-massify the masses by rebuilding the little platoons.\" </p> <p>The problem with all this is that in the case of at least some of his proposals, it is not at all clear that they will help to reduce inequality; in fact they may well increase it. This certainly applies to his proposals for vouchers and the replacement of parts of the welfare state by faith-based organisations. And it should not really surprise us because, in the end, his motivation seems at least as much about reducing the power of government as tackling inequality. That is the inherent tension at the heart of this book: between a worry about \"cultural impoverishment\", for which he crudely blames the state, and economic inequality, about which he has a more nuanced analysis. If he is to tackle the latter, he must abandon the 1980s philosophy about government, which he is not willing to do. </p> <p>Moreover, he fails to see that cultural impoverishment does not simply cohabit with economic inequality but is in part a consequence of it. The danger for our society is that we promise mobility in theory, but in practice stack the odds against those born into the wrong circumstances. That is the best recipe for a country where people are isolated and resentful. The solution to this is not to seek to recreate communities of the past, but to create a society with less structural inequality than today, one that is fair and open to all. </p> <p>What, then, can the left learn from Conservatives like Ferdinand Mount? That one can believe in a role for markets and at the same time seek to correct the unfairness of market outcomes. That it is right to worry about the effect of structural changes in our society and to try to seek solutions. And that worrying about inequality is something even one-nation Conservatives do. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Edward Miliband is chair of the council of economic advisers at HM Treasury.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Big Bang </strong> <br>by Simon Singh <br>544pp,Fourth Estate, \u00a320</p> <p> Simon Singh, in this very large book, presents a history of the evolving discovery of the universe from early historic times up to the 1990s. He shows how the term \"universe\" expanded in its definition from the Milky Way (some 100,000 light years across), through the realisation that we live in merely one \"island universe\" among many, with truly vast distances separating these islands. By the 1930s it had been discovered that these \"islands\" were indeed star systems, now called\"galaxies\". </p> <p>Some galaxies are like our Milky Way, but most have very different shapes and sizes. Even more dramatically, the vast distances between these galaxies were observed to be increasing, with this expansion of the universe - by then redefined to include all of space-time - universally known as Hubble's law. </p> <p>In parallel, the sun had been recognised as one star among very many, geologists had realised that our Earth was billions of years old, while nuclear fusion, transmuting the elements from hydrogen and helium into the stardust of oxygen and carbon, was identified as the energy source sustaining light and life for these eons. The origin of the chemical elements in stars was (more or less) understood by the 1960s, though it became apparent that hydrogen and helium must have a different, pre-stellar origin. This was soon known to be during the few minutes after the start of the Big Bang, the event in which space-time, and our universe, came into existence. </p> <p>Through the 20th century a qualitative description of the objects - galaxies - that make up the visible universe was also becoming accepted. The new science of radio astronomy discovered enough hydrogen not yet formed into stars to show that the universe was roughly midway through its stellar-bright phase: by the 1960s it was known we were comfortably in orbit around a middle-aged star in a suburban part of an average galaxy midway through its life. </p> <p>This Norman Rockwell-style universe soon collapsed under a barrage of unexpected discoveries: the residual heat from the Big Bang, itself the origin of the universe as we see it, was soon found (it is visible today as TV static), creating the science of origins, while technological advances allowed vastly improved direct study of the distant, and young, universe. </p> <p>A huge convenience of observational astrophysics is the finite speed of light: as we look far away we unavoidably see objects as they were long ago, when the light left them. Thus astronomers see ancient objects as they were. By looking at different distances we see the evolving universe directly (raising fascinating issues about the meaning of \"now\"). These technological advances, however, finally forced astronomers to take our insignificance seriously. This \"Copernican principle\" reminds us we should not expect be too special: our eyes are adapted to detect predators (cave bears) and potential food, and not necessarily to allow an unbiased view of the nature of existence and energy. Remarkably, our minds can make this leap. Quantitative astrophysics soon discovered that what we see is not what we get: most matter does not shine in any waveband, light, heat, X-rays or radio. It is in fact dark. Ergo, dark matter. </p> <p>The latest energy census suggests that everything which shines, and everything which is studied by scientists on Earth, is an almost irrelevant perturbation of reality. Matter like that of which we are constituted makes up a small percentage of the mass-energy of the universe. There is roughly 10 times as much dark stuff, of unknown nature but which is matter (it responds to and generates gravity), as there is stuff we can identify (\"see\"). </p> <p>Recently, amid much publicity, astrophysicists have discovered that there is roughly three times more of some other stuff, which is not matter, but which has pressure (it pushes, gravity pulls). This \"dark energy\" took control of the future of the universe around the time the sun and Earth were formed, and started accelerating the cosmic expansion. The universe today is expanding faster and faster, leading to a future that remains to be understood, but which may well be very lonely indeed. Exciting times. </p> <p>By the 1990s, Singh tells us, the basic Big Bang model of the universe, with its many spectacular successes in describing what astronomers observe, was in place. Dark matter, dark energy and the continuing rapid progress in discovery, is summarised in an epilogue to Big Bang which claims that cosmology \"evolves too rapidly for any book to be really up to date. The approach is based on brief biographies of key scientists through the discovery process: the book is a history of the key events in mankind's discovery of cosmology, and the current pre-eminence of the Big Bang model. It is not a history of the universe.\" </p> <p>Singh tells his tale well, with chatty anecdotes leavening the astrophysics. Many highly motivated personalities are described - not all of whom separated personal dislike from professional competition. All, however, are keen scientists and are therefore subject to excitement, occasional success and - most of the time - frustrating hard work. One conspicuous and useful aspect of this book is the personalisation of the scientist and his/her motivation. I liked the quotation from Einstein: \"I have no special talents: I am only passionately curious.\" </p> <p>The great physicist Richard Feynman expressed the methodology of science beautifully: \"It doesn't matter how beautiful your guess is or how smart you are or what your name is. If [your idea] disagrees with experience, it's wrong. That's all there is to it.\" </p> <p>The progression of generation, testing, refuting, improving and developing ideas to understand the origin of everything is the story of this book. It is an interesting story. And it isn't finished yet. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Gerry Gilmore is professor of experimental philosophy at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge University.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Shooting History</strong><br> by Jon Snow<br> 352pp, HarperCollins, \u00a320</p> <p><strong> The Road Taken</strong><br> by Michael Buerk<br> 456pp, Hutchinson, \u00a320 <br> </p> <p>\"Fame is fun\" says Michael Buerk, but he adds that in television it is all spurious. \"You are not celebrated for your achievements. You are famous merely because you are recognisable. It is a worthless kind of celebrity.\" Jon Snow is similarly unimpressed when he is offered the presenter's chair on Channel 4 News: \"I was going to have to be lashed to the studio desk ... It would take years before I felt comfortable in the role.\" </p> <p>It is a curiosity of the news business that almost everyone secretly wants to be a presenter; but once they make it, many join the coterie of presenters who believe or say (or both) that it's not a proper job. The standard line is that it's simply about \"reading aloud\" or performing in a studio away from the real frontlines of life. And yet for viewers it is something more. The best newsreaders and correspondents are trusted - even loved. When there is bad news, it matters who delivers it; and broadcast news is inescapably about personalities as well as issues. </p> <p>The book trade knows this. Hence Kate Adie on her adventures in the first Gulf war, and Rageh Omaar on the second. John Sergeant would be a poorer man if Mrs Thatcher hadn't loomed up behind him live on television and then formed the centrepiece of his journalistic memoirs. It's not just about their jobs, either. Adie tells the story of her adoption, and now she is joined by Buerk on his bigamist father and Snow on enforced masturbation at boarding school. So they overcome any shyness: indeed, Buerk has three pictures of himself on the book's dustjacket while Snow manages nine. </p> <p>Yet it would be wrong to buy the argument that this is all about superficiality and not about achievement. Buerk and Snow are two of the finest reporters of their generation. Twenty years on, it is hard to think of any television news films that have had the impact of Buerk's reporting from Ethiopia; and Snow represents the best traditions of the old ITN, which cared about Central America and Africa more than video walls and audience demographics. Both men are brilliant at their jobs and their books will inspire anyone who wants to know what television is like at the uncomfortable end of the camera when the bullets are flying. </p> <p>There are differences, though, in their approach to autobiography. Both skilfully evoke contrasting childhoods - Snow's rather posh and Buerk's in a single-parent family in the grey Midlands of the 1950s. From then onwards, it's Buerk's account of his adult life which remains the warmer, funnier and more personal. Snow is keener on the evolution of his beliefs: from a Conservative (with a capital C) childhood through student radicalism and into a journalistic career where he is keen to share his opinions as well as his exploits. </p> <p>At the risk of sounding like a dull BBC suit, I'm not sure this approach does Snow many favours. He tends to assert rather than argue. On the European Union, for instance, he tells us his position has evolved \"from outright hostility ... to an ardent desire now to be much more a part of Europe than any British referendum has ever dared contemplate\". But he doesn't explain why. Equally, his conviction that we should join the euro is tacked on to a sketchy account of the ERM crisis. But it is on the United States that he is, paradoxically for a former Washington correspondent, least persuasive. Ronald Reagan was an \"ideologue\" with \"bile-strewn\" views on the cold war. Worse still, he notes gravely, Reagan's misconceived worldview \"was very much a forerunner of George W's\". </p> <p>Some of this is just standard politics for the liberal wing of society, overlaid with a presenter's natural leaning towards the great men theory of history. So Snow believes the cold war was brought to an end by Mikhail Gorbachev. But at times the analysis becomes very odd. On 9/11, for instance, he writes: \"I was convinced that, though these events were appallingly traumatic, America was capable of taking them in its stride\" - thus seemingly being one of the few people on the planet not to think the US would retaliate, and going on to blame \"the searing power of the Hollywood imagery of the Saudi assailants' attack\" as a factor in the war on terror. </p> <p>This might appear not to matter. What counts is Snow's high-quality performance on television and not what he says in any book. But he claims \"a strong if informal input into the editorial process\" and it's interesting to ask how the Snowite tendency would react if the boot were on the other foot. How about a public service television news presenter who baldly stated George W Bush was a good thing and that Britain should consider withdrawing from the EU? </p> <p>In fairness, some of Buerk's writing indicates his views, too - he is less outspoken but manifestly no friend of US policy in El Salvador - and there are cultural assumptions underlying all editorial decisions in television news. But we are still in the era where the main broadcasters are expected to be impartial. Buerk's opinions on news and the BBC aren't all to my taste, but I am happy that we're no nearer to knowing which way he votes after reading his book. Indeed, one of the best passages is when he is expelled from South Africa and resents the way \"views, virtues and vices I did not have were projected on to me by those with axes to grind\". </p> <p>So Buerk wins on purity while Snow is ahead on provocation. They are both in the dock for occasional long-windedness, and after some sections most readers won't want to hear another word about television crewing arrangements or travel plans in Africa. But there are terrific snapshots, too, from extraordinary times; and as accounts of how television fame is earned it would be hard to begrudge either man their achievements - or their fun. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Roger Mosey is head of BBC television news.</p>",
  "A police officer found yesterday by an inquest jury to have unlawfully killed an unarmed man five years ago, has been promoted by his force, the Guardian has learned. <p>An inquest jury yesterday recorded a 7-2 majority verdict that Harry Stanley was unlawfully killed by police in September 1999, just yards from his east London home. </p> <p>Two firearms officers opened fire at Mr Stanley, believing a table leg he was carrying in a blue plastic bag was a shotgun. </p> <p>The jury rejected their claims that they believed Mr Stanley, 46, had posed an imminent threat to their lives. </p> <p>The verdict has implications for police use of guns, and after the verdict the St Pancras coroner, Dr Andrew Reid, said he would ask the Home Office to review firearms policy and practices. </p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service said they would consider charging the officers, having refused to do so twice before. </p> <p>The Metropolitan police suspended Neil Sharman and PC Kevin Fagan. Mr Sharman, an inspector at the time he shot Mr Stanley, was promoted this year to chief inspector. </p> <p>Yesterday's verdict, which came after more than seven hours of deliberation, triggered emotional scenes. Mr Stanley's family cheered, then sobbing could be heard from Mr Stanley's widow Irene, and others, and a jury member later burst into tears. </p> <p>Afterwards Mrs Stanley said the pain of losing her husband had been made worse by having to battle the authorities for five years and demanded the officers now be charged: \"You've lost a loved one and you should not have to fight for justice, it should be there for you.\" </p> <p>A previous inquest recorded an open verdict which the high court quashed after finding the coroner had wrongly refused to allow the first inquest jury to consider an unlawful killing verdict. </p> <p>On his last day alive Mr Stanley had gone to his brother's house to repair a broken table leg. He had recently had surgery for stomach cancer which left him in such pain he could not bend to tie his shoelaces or raise his arms, and was able only to walk slowly. </p> <p>After leaving his brother's house Mr Stanley visited several pubs on his way home, and was twice over the legal drink-drive limit at the time of his shooting. After he left a pub in Hackney carrying a table leg, a fellow drinker called the police at 7.44pm, saying an Irishman had left the pub carrying a gun. Eight minutes later Mr Sharman and PC Fagan were in an armed response vehicle, and spotted Mr Stanley walking along the street. </p> <p>The two officers said they opened fire after shouting at Mr Stanley: \"Stop, armed police.\" The officers had approached him from behind with their weapons drawn. </p> <p>They claimed the painter and decorator had turned round and faced them, and raised the object they believed to be a gun in a classic gunshot pose, as if he was about to open fire. </p> <p>PC Fagan told the inquest: \"The realisation struck me that I was about to be shot at 15ft with a sawn-off shotgun.\" He said he shouted \"drop it\" only to be faced by Mr Stanley in a \"boxer's stance\". </p> <p>PC Fagan claimed Mr Stanley then moved his left hand to grip the object so he carried it with both hands. Inspector Sharman said he shot Mr Stanley fearing he was about to shoot his colleague. </p> <p>Mr Stanley's family say ballistics and forensic evidence show the officers' accounts to be untrue. The jury declared he was not facing the officers and \"had begun to turn\" when the shots were fired. </p> <p>The fatal shot fired by Mr Sharman entered the left side of his head, just above his ear. </p> <p>Daniel Machover, solicitor for the Stanley family, said: \"The family have sympathy for the officers up to a point. But this jury did not accept they told the truth about facing an imminent threat to their lives, the reason given for opening fire. These officers' accounts have not been believed. \" </p> <p>In the last decade inquest juries have found that police unlawfully killed eight people in cases where the CPS had initially decided not to prosecute. Subsequently no officer has ever been convicted. </p> <p>Deciding in 2001 not to charge the officers, the CPS said that scientific evidence \"may provide some support for the conclusion that the police officers may have been inaccurate or even lied about their respective positions in the street\". But prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence for a jury to conclude they were acting unlawfully. </p> <p>In a statement the Met said: \"The officers were called upon to make a split-second decision while confronting what they believed to be an imminent threat to their lives. They did not have the benefit of hindsight.\" It added: \"We will carefully consider today's inquest verdict and any implications it may have for future firearms policy.\" </p> <p>The coroner, Dr Reid, said he would ask the Home Office to review how police challenge suspects who have consumed alcohol or drugs or have mental problems, and also to re-examine armed police challenging suspects from behind.</p>",
  "Your leading article (October 29) clearly touches a raw nerve in government. I addressed the same issues in a speech on Monday - and Labour attacked me. Extraordinary threats, such as those posed by international terrorism, may require a different balance between our liberties and our security. But such measures should always be limited, short-term and subject to constant review. <p>Preparing legislation to target yobs and nuisance neighbours is quite different from terrorism. The prime minister and home secretary must be strongly resisted when they encourage a \"climate of fear\" to threaten civil liberties which generations of Britons have relied on. Hard-won rights, once lost, may never be regained.</p> <p>On issues such as this, as well as our opposition to the Iraq war, the spirit of the Guardian and the Liberal Democrats must make common cause against the illiberalism of this government.<br> <b>Charles Kennedy</b><br> Leader, Liberal Democrats</p>",
  "\"Greetings from the sand box. It's dusty, it's smelly, it's hot and it's loud,\" wrote a former occupant of Camp Dogwood, the new desert base of the Black Watch that once housed 4,000 American troops. <p>It is also some distance from the so-called Triangle of Death, the lethal badlands south of Baghdad that have provided fertile recruiting ground for Islamist extremists and criminal gangs. </p> <p>After the Black Watch's troubled journey north from the British base in Basra, it might now have to be renamed Camp Incoming because of its attraction to mortar-firing rebels. </p> <p>The 850-strong deployment, consisting of Black Watch soldiers, Queens Dragoon Guards, Royal Marine Commandos and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, is operating out of a massive former logistics base set up by US forces during the Gulf War. </p> <p>It was previously home to Saddam Hussein's hated Republican Guards, who manned the many watch-towers punctuating its 26-mile perimeter in the bleak desert wastes, west of the Euphrates river. </p> <p>The battlegroup's mission, named Operation Bracken, is to deter the criminal and terrorist gangs operating freely in the area, which in the past has provided \"rat-run\" escapes for militants from the flashpoint city of Falluja. </p> <p>Once described as a \"useless desert plot\" by an American Army journalist, the 60 by 40 mile-zone under the control of the Black Watch battlegroup is a featureless plain dotted by hamlets and villages that provide ideal hiding places for terrorists. </p> <p>Larger settlements lining the Euphrates also give insurgents ideal cover to launch attacks against bridges and main roads used by coalition forces struggling to restore order in the lawless region. </p> <p>\"It's not the Triangle of Death but it would be a huge mistake to underestimate the dangers of this place,\" said Colonel James Bashall, the chief of staff of the Multi-national Division in south-east Iraq. \"Once they know that we are there, I would not underestimate what might happen. The roads are potentially dangerous, any movement is potentially dangerous.\" </p> <p>Col Bashall was among the party of senior British officers who decided the Black Watch were able to meet the American request for help. </p> <p>He met his American counterparts for a briefing on what the Black Watch could expect to face during their 30-day operation while the displaced US troops join a major assault on Falluja, some 20 miles north. </p> <p>\"There's a different level of barbarity up there, compared to here,\" he said. \"It takes quite a long time to understand the needs of the people and the threat under which you are working. </p> <p>\"The Americans told us a lot but it's not enough until you are on the ground yourself. I think it will take the Black Watch at least a week to start getting to know people.\" </p> <p>Ryan Culhane, who spent several months in the camp last year as part of the US army's 459th Engineer Company, said the Black Watch's operation would not be easy. </p> <p>\"The weather is a nightmare for all your equipment,\" he said. \"Each time you leave the post you are putting your lives in danger.\" </p> <p>Staff Sergeant Ray Yakesh told of the daily danger from insurgents planting roadside bombs to kill unwary troops when he was stationed there last year. </p> <p>\"Night-time bomb sweeps along roads used by troops happened all the time,\" he said. \"Our mission was to go out and search for improvised explosive devices, some of the bombs were two-feet long. </p> <p>\"They would link them up to pagers or mobile phones and call the number to blow them up. The squad would have to go out in Humvees with night vision goggles looking for unusual objects or people who looked as if they might be planting bombs,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It was a great relief to get out of there.\" </p> <p> This is a pooled despatch from the Daily Express correspondent with the Black Watch</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> The news that Boris Johnson had become a football terrace chant - Millwall fans sang \"there's only one Boris Johnson\" to taunt Liverpool supporters this week - made me wonder how many other people, apart from footballers and managers have received this signal honour. There was that man who killed two policemen who was the subject of the \"he kills coppers\" chant of many years ago. But I can't think, off hand, of anyone else - least of all a Conservative MP and magazine editor. <p><b>\u00b7</b> We have a new Tesco in our neighbourhood, and outside it last weekend I bumped into Greg Dyke. I asked him if it was true that he had a new licence plate for his car and he said \"come and see it\". And there it was, parked outside the laundrette, a silver Lexus with plates reading M16 WMD. An astute person at the licensing authority had spotted it and wanted to know if he would like it. If I were one of those people who had helped get rid of Greg and the chairman, Gavyn Davies, I would be worried. Greg is a man quite prepared to eat his revenge cold, ice cold if necessary, but in large quantities and with relish. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I've been reading Hiding The Elephant by Jim Steinmeyer (Heinemann, \u00a314.99). I love tales of the old magicians; how they did their tricks, their rivalries, hatreds and theft of each other's ideas. One story is about Howard Thurston, the American magician who perfected the levitating lady trick. This was quite easily done with scores of fine wires, painted with something that didn't reflect the light. Thurston used to invite a man and a boy onto the stage to inspect the illusion. As one of the boys revealed later, when he was grown up: \"I saw more damn wires than I'd ever seen in my life. As Thurston lifted me up, he whispered, 'if you touch any of those blankety-blank wires ...' Well, I'd never heard language like that in my life. I opened my eyes and my mouth wide, which made everyone in the audience think I was amazed at what I was seeing. They all laughed and applauded ...\" </p> <p>Any idiot can make a lady float or saw her in half. The true genius comes in moments like that one. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I had one of those moments of terror this week, the kind that make you think \"this must be a dream, and any moment I'm going to wake up\". But you don't. </p> <p>I was doing a live turn on BBC News 24 about the Commons' decision to drop the term strangers and call visitors members of the public. I was at Westminster; the interviewer in west London. Before we started, my earpiece, which feeds in the questions, had fallen out a couple of times, but I thought I had jammed it safely back in. I was wrong. When the interviewer had asked the second question it fell out. Though I was staring at the camera with a wild surmise, I could see myself peripherally on the monitor, grasping maniacally for the thing, but reaching only the microphone wire. Then as I chuntered on, answering questions which I might possibly have been asked, I could see myself twisting to the floor, like a man being attacked by a crack squad of anacondas. In the end a technician found half the thing on the floor, and the other on my back collar. The News 24 people were very nice about it, but I don't suppose they'll have me back soon. Say what you like about Andrew Marr, but he is a safe pair of ears. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Your family sayings are still pouring in. Laurence Inman writes from Birmingham about his friend Professor Chris Brooks, an expert on things Victorian. \"He edited a book about the Albert Memorial, and was present at the unveiling when it wasrestored.

  "<p>Manchester United and Arsenal hoard much of the Premiership's wealth, but these clubs hold no monopoly on animosity. The entire fixture list is a tangle of sensitive personal histories, long-cherished grudges and wounded feelings. This weekend presents us with a perfect set of case studies. </p> <p>The meeting of Birmingham City and Crystal Palace this afternoon may, for example, be a rather unappetising prospect for the general public, but many of the people who will assemble at St Andrews can barely wait to get their teeth into it. </p> <p>The fans who have travelled from the south will vilify Steve Bruce. Having taken the manager's post at Selhurst Park in the summer of 2001, he soon spoke of his happiness at finding a club where he felt wanted. The fondness cannot have been reciprocated all that strongly by him because he left for Birmingham at the end of the year. </p> <p>Any spare antagonism in the visiting support today can be directed at Julian Gray. He declined to sign a new contract with Palace, who therefore received no fee when he opted, as a free agent, to be reunited with Bruce at St Andrews. The crowd, all the same, are not the only ones with an excuse to brood. </p> <p>The Palace midfielder Michael Hughes was fleetingly on Birmingham's books. He went there on loan from Wimbledon in March 2002. Although he then injured his ankle, it was his understanding that he was guaranteed a longer-term deal if Birmingham achieved promotion to the Premiership that season, as they duly did. </p> <p>Instead, Hughes soon required financial support from the PFA as the dispute kept him out of football for 16 months until he received compensation from Birmingham. Fellow professionals sympathised, but the Northern Ireland international will not expect unmitigated solidarity from them today. </p> <p>His excessive challenge on Robbie Savage provoked a reaction as both of them were sent off in the 2-2 draw with Wales at the Millen nium Stadium last month. There was some sympathy with the argument that Savage, for once, was the wronged party. A player who frequently seems to be at odds with the rest of the human race was soon heard invoking his own human rights when a one-match ban was imposed. </p> <p>This is a week when there have been several demonstrations that combativeness is part of the life force of football. It is pointless and even hypocritical to be scandalised when the contentiousness that makes the sport so exciting to us smashes through its flimsy boundaries. </p> <p>Should good manners be maintained at St Andrews, with Palace's Andy Johnson stifling an impulse to gloat if he happens to score against the club that off-loaded him, we ought to pause and appreciate how much decorum survives despite all the provocative factors. </p> <p>There are more and more causes of friction. Now that Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have virtually separated themselves from the remainder of the Premiership, the games between them are breeding grounds for obsession. When Arsenal went to Old Trafford last weekend, every detail of their previous visit a year before was vivid in their minds. </p> <p>It was all too simple for them to resume the antagonism with Ruud van Nistelrooy that had arisen in the 2003 match. If Arsenal are guilty of throwing food and soup in the tunnel afterwards their conduct was pathetic as well as wrong, but no one should be surprised when incidents get out of control in a competition so overblown that a tussle for three points can be deemed the game of the decade. </p> <p>In the Premiership, everything tends to be expanded until it becomes unignorable. Jamie Carragher seems ready to act with dispassionate professionalism today when he faces Blackburn's Lucas Neill, who broke the Liverpool full-back's leg last year, but the Anfield audience may not be so inclined to let bygones be bygones, particularly if the visitors are doing well. </p> <p>Football is being asked to suppress an ever-increasing potential for uproar. The sport is operated in a rampantly commercial manner yet it is marketed with an appeal to old-fashioned ties and feelings. Spectators are urged to flaunt their devotion to their clubs, but at the same time it is guaranteed that they will be betrayed sooner or later. </p> <p>Clubs seek to transfer players while they can still get a fee for them and the footballers depart in search of improvement or just their next signing-on fee. The behaviour of some of the West Ham fans at Chelsea on Wednesday was despicable, but there were ready targets for the louts. Although Mateja Kezman was hit by a coin, objects were also thrown at Joe Cole and Frank Lampard, who used to be on the Upton Park payroll. </p> <p>In so many matches nowadays, the line-up for the opposing team borders on a roll call of hate figures. This afternoon the Spurs midfielder Sean Davis goes back to Fulham, where he claimed not so long ago to see his entire future. As the game at St Andrews shows, the moves that players make often string a cat's cradle of resentments across the land. </p> <p>Football is a mobile profession. The Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho understood the consequences well enough to beg Uefa not to take action against his former club when a Porto fan spat on him a month ago. The general restraint of people in football is more noteworthy than the occasional eruptions. </p> <p>We ask those in the game to endure loathing, to commit all their emotional reserves and, in the case of the players, to be constantly aggressive while stopping a hair's breadth short of mayhem. All in all, the FA can count itself lucky that there are so few outrages to be investigated. </p> <p><strong>Five of the greatest grudges ever:</strong></p> <p><strong> Norman Hunter and Peter Osgood</strong> </p> <p> Chelsea and Leeds had perhaps the greatest long-running rivalry of the 70s, starting with a bad-tempered FA Cup final replay in 1970, and Hunter and Osgood were at its centre. \"There was a tremendous rivalry between Ossie and myself,\" said Hunter. \"You started getting into him a bit and to be fair he'd come back at you, would Ossie. He wasn't afraid at all.\" Fans still talk wistfully of a famous sideburn-pulling incident (Hunter was doing the pulling) later in 1970. </p> <p> <strong> England and Argentina</strong> </p> <p> It all started in 1966, when England beat Argentina in a World Cup quarter-final at Wembley, the visiting captain Antonio Rattin was sent off but refused to go, and Alf Ramsey described the Argentinians as \"animals\". Then there was a war in the Falklands and Maradona's Hand of God in Mexico. \"We knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds,\" Maradona wrote. \"And this was revenge.\" English players were riled by aggressive gloating after the 1998 World Cup penalty shoot-out defeat, and gained revenge of their own in 2002. Still simmering. </p> <p> <strong> Roy Keane and Alf Inge Haaland</strong> </p> <p> It is not a good idea to taunt Roy Keane, particularly when he is injured. Haaland made that mistake, and in April 2001 Keane got his revenge with a career-ending tackle. \"I'd waited long enough,\" the Irishman wrote in his autobiography. \"I hit him hard. Take that, you c***. And don't ever stand over me again sneering about fake injuries.\" </p> <p> <strong> Graeme Souness and Terry Yorath</strong> </p> <p> In the years when Scotland and Wales often played each other, these two were always scrapping. \"There's no friction on my part,\" said Yorath innocently after one clash in 1979, \"but I always seem to have trouble from him.\" </p> <p> <strong> Graeme Le Saux and Mauricio Taricco</strong> </p> <p> In September 2001 Le Saux had to be restrained from attacking Taricco after the final whistle, Chelsea having beaten Spurs at White Hart Lane. He alleged he had been punched in the face. In March 2002 Le Saux was sent off for a dreadful tackle on the Argentinian, minutes after Taricco had come off the bench. Three days later the sides met again and sure enough Taricco was sent off for a foul on Le Saux described by the referee Alan Wiley as \"high, late and very dangerous\".</p>",
  "<p>Jose Mourinho last night revealed that he confronted Adrian Mutu over suspicions the player was using cocaine just days after joining Chelsea. </p> <p>The Romanian international striker was yesterday dismissed from the job for gross misconduct after it emerged he faced a Football Association hearing next week for a failed drugs test. That prompted the Professional Footballers' Association to claim that Chelsea had failed in their \"duty of care\" to an employee who has had \"serious personal problems\". </p> <p>Mourinho said he recognised problems immediately. \"When I met him on his first day in the pre-season in July and he was with his two agents Mr [Victor] Becali and Gica Popescu I told all three 'I have information that you are on cocaine',\" he said. </p> <p>\"All three were laughing, denying, saying this was a lot of lies about Adrian. After that I did not speak with them again because they denied the situation. </p> <p>\"For a long period we saw now and again strange behaviour. Arriving late a few times, not coming in to train other times. A doctor visiting his house and the apparent reason was just headaches. Injured when nobody knows how it happened - for example he was on the bench and did not play against Paris [Saint-Germain] yet the next day he was injured. </p> <p>\"We spoke about it. Is he pushing us to let him go in December? Is he doing this to get into a conflict with me [so I] say I don't want this player here? Or is he involved in other things? </p> <p>\"We began to question and the club doctor, because he has some experience that we do not have, was analysing with different eyes and he arrived at the decision that maybe yes. I would never sign him again. Not just because of the drug, but because he called me a liar.\" </p> <p>It was the first verbal attack from Chelsea as the battle lines were being drawn in what is likely to become a costly legal process. The club have engaged Jonathan Taylor, head of Hammonds' sports law group, with the FA appointing as prosecuting counsel Mark Gay, a board member of the British Association for Sport and Law. </p> <p>As well as representation from the PFA, it is understood that Mutu's advisers were last night in advanced negotiations with Nick Bitel to act as defence counsel. The Culture, Media and Sport select committee called Bitel as an expert witness in its formulation of a drugs in sport report, and his testimony supported the FA's allowance in its rules for a divergence in the considerations of recreational and performance-enhancing drugs. This, along with Mutu's willingness to undergo a programme of rehabilitation is expected to form the basis of Mutu's defence. </p> <p>It is not, however, a discrepancy Mourinho appreciates. \"Recreational drugs are private life but football players, especially the pros of the big teams, they have a very, very big responsibility,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The club bought [Mutu] to be ready to play football and in this moment he will be out of competition for a long period. The first one to break the relation was the player so he cannot complain. </p> <p>\"The club gave him everything he needs to have a good professional life and as he was saying in a few interviews this is a personal problem in his life. The club cannot be blamed; it is his fault.\" </p> <p>The question of liability is central to the legal dispute. Following next week's FA hearing Chelsea may seek recourse to claim compensation from Mutu or any club that recruits him, since the dismissal writes off a \u00a312m asset from their books. Mutu would be entitled to the defence that it also conveniently saves Chelsea around \u00a311m in his wages, and it is one the PFA is already citing. </p> <p>\"They're trying to look for compensation and saying he can't play anywhere else,\" said the PFA chairman Gordon Taylor, though Chelsea merely indicate they \"reserve the right\" to do so and no decision has yet been taken. </p> <p>\"To choose to [seek compensation], that is something we would resist. [The sacking] is a judgment they've made and we wouldn't agree 100% that any club has the right for [a player's use of] a social drug to lead to them terminating the contract. At the moment there is no reason to believe it is anything but a one-off problem. </p> <p>\"If it has been terminated wrongly, then there could be compensation for the individual.\" </p> <p>Mourinho's testimony that he was aware of Mutu's drug abuse four months ago challenges the belief that the problem is \"one off\" and it was that which prompted Chelsea to target test the player. </p> <p>\"We are within our rights to target test, within the FA doping controls, and, having tested positive, we dismissed him,\" Chelsea's chief executive Peter Kenyon said. \"We informed Adrian Mutu of our decision last night and his response is between Adrian and [me].\" </p> <p>Taylor confirmed that Mutu's mind is troubled by the developments, since Chelsea's actions have \"confirmed his worst fears\". Considering the circumstances of Mark Bosnich, who has not returned to the game almost two years after becoming the last player to be dismissed by Chelsea for cocaine use, Mutu's career is in tatters. </p> <p><strong>Diary of dishonour:</strong></p> <p><strong> October 1</strong> Mutu takes drug test at behest of the Chelsea manager. One of his agents, Victor Becali, says: 'Mourinho asked for the test after Mutu failed to show up at training soon after the match against Paris Saint-Germain [on September 14]. I think Mourinho's decision followed Mutu's bizarre attitude.' </p> <p><strong> October 6</strong> Mutu declares he is in 'open conflict' with Mourinho. </p> <p><strong> October 9</strong> Defies Mourinho by playing for Romania against the Czech Republic. The manager fines him for his earlier comments. </p> <p><strong> October 16</strong> Left out of squad to play Manchester City. </p> <p><strong> October 17</strong> News breaks that he has tested positive for a banned drug. Loses \u00a3700,000 Pepsi sponsorship. </p> <p><strong> October 18</strong> Returns from Italy for meeting with his representatives and the PFA. </p> <p><strong> October 19</strong> After meeting Gordon Taylor, admits taking banned drug and agrees to accept his guilt without an analysis of the B sample. </p> <p> <strong> October 20</strong> Returns to Rome after agreeing to start a daily process of counselling. </p> <p><strong> October 22</strong> Mutu finally speaks: 'The only reason I took what I took was that I wanted to improve my sexual performance. It may be funny but it is true.' </p> <p> <strong> October 25</strong> Flies into London with his agents for another meeting with the FA and Chelsea's chief executive Peter Kenyon. </p> <p><strong> October 29</strong> Sacked by his club.</p>",
  "<p>So much for the match of the decade - or should that be decayed? </p> <p>Burdened by a surfeit of hype, last Sunday's encounter between Manchester United and Arsenal failed to deliver anything except a fresh bout of the controversy that regularly accompanies this fixture. </p> <p>A new nadir has been reached when the most urgent debate about a game of football concerns the flavour of the soup thrown over one of the managers during a bust-up in the tunnel after the final whistle. </p> <p>Or was Sir Alex Ferguson pelted with pizza and, if so, was it crisp or deep pan? It would be helpful if, before future confrontations between these sides, the teamsheets include details of the postmatch menus, just so we know where we are. </p> <p>Football does not need this sort of nonsense. The English game is already suffering another bout of unease about what goes on off the pitch without any of the Premiership's leading players re-enacting the food fight scene from National Lampoon's Animal House. </p> <p>This season, instead of a succession of women lining up to accuse footballers of sexual assault, the courts have seen a corner lifted on the dingier aspects of the transfer business, the odour of which hangs over the game like the smell of bad drains. </p> <p>In addition there have been reminders that, though hooliganism has been largely dispersed, the potential for its return is still there, as was seen on successive evenings this week during Carling Cup ties at Millwall and Chelsea. The sight of the Chelsea striker Mateja Kezman leaving the pitch with a bloodied face after being struck by a missile was rather more serious than Ferguson getting caught in a peasouper. </p> <p>Surely the most pertinent issue about the non-event at Old Trafford is whether the frenzy of the build-up got to the players before, during and particularly after the match. Sky announced the game to background music from a James Bond film, Live and Let Die, which was overdoing things a bit. </p> <p>Maybe, in an increasingly bland and predictable Premiership, meetings of the mighty few are fated to be treated in this overblown fashion. Arsenal have yet to meet Chelsea, United still have to visit Highbury and the supply of hyperbolic steroids is limitless. </p> <p>The only decade to which the latest match involving United and Arsenal could claim affiliation is the 70s when remorseless, unforgiving encounters between the big teams were the norm. Sunday's game recalled images of those grudging, grinding affairs between Bill Shankly's Liverpool and Don Revie's Leeds. </p> <p>Manchester United won the match but lost kudos because of their physical approach to it. In time-honoured fashion United got stuck in but by so doing acknowledged the superiority of Arsenal's football through their reluctance to take on Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's players in an open game. </p> <p>The sticking-in included a blatant over-the-top challenge by Ruud van Nistelrooy on Ashley Cole and there appeared to be a contract out on Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes. The subsequent three-match ban imposed on Van Nistelrooy has added a Pyrrhic aspect to Manchester United's victory. </p> <p>Arsenal's prospects for retaining the championship have not been seriously harmed this early in the season. Chelsea, the champions' closest challengers, were the main beneficiaries. </p> <p>Van Nistelrooy was suspended after the Football Association had seen a video of his challenge on Cole. The referee, Mike Riley, had not seen it. Nor did he see fit to send off United's Rio Ferdinand, the last defender when he brought down Fredrik Ljungberg. It is understood, however, that Riley is not a distant relative of Blind O'Reilly. </p> <p>The worst of Arsenal's behaviour was saved for the rumble in the tunnel. Nevertheless Patrick Vieira's frequent nagging of the referee recalled the way Argentina's captain Antonio Rattin was sent off against England in the 1966 World Cup quarter-finals. Rudolf Kreitlein finally dismissed Rattin because, as he explained later, he did not like the look on his face. </p> <p>The media got its jock-straps in a twist over Sunday's fixture because the game offered Manchester United a chance to kick-start their season and at the same time deny Arsenal an unbeaten half-century of league fixtures. United achieved the latter but kicked Reyes instead. </p> <p>Arsenal may not be entirely displeased that their run is over. Winning the title without losing a match was a considerable feat but this season the unbeaten sequence had been a statistical quirk in danger of becoming a distraction. </p> <p>There is an argument for saying records spread over two seasons should not count. In theory Arsenal's run could be overtaken by a team that, having lost its opening 13 league fixtures, goes unbeaten for its last 25, reversing the process the following season. In which case, so what? </p> <p>Either way Nottingham Forest's unbeaten run of 40 games in all competitions in 1978 is still the more impressive achievement. And so far as is known Brian Clough's teams were not given to chucking soup over opposing managers.</p>",
  "<p>Marat Safin has never been shy of showing his emotions but his meltdown against Michael Llodra in the quarter-finals of the St Petersburg Open yesterday was remarkable even by the volatile Russian's standards. </p> <p>\"I've been playing non-stop for several weeks and obviously I'm getting burnt out both physically and mentally,\" said Safin, whose disappointment was compounded by losing, 6-4, 6-1, in front of his home crowd. \"I tried today but it wasn't enough.\" </p> <p>The man who bore the brunt of his fury was the Brazilian umpire Carlos Bernardes, who overruled a call that had originally been in Safin's favour at 4-4 in the first set. It set off a long, noisy and indignant rant which had a catastrophic effect on Safin's game. </p> <p>\"Of course it's very frustrating to see the umpire making clear mistakes and then refusing to change his mind,\" said Safin. \"It's just too bad for the game that we have people who think they are above the law.\" </p> <p>The tantrum could prove costly for it hurt Safin's chances of securing one of the last two qualifying places in the eight-man field for the Masters Cup in Houston, which he, Tim Henman and Andre Agassi are currently contesting. Safin is marginally ahead of Henman in the race, with Agassi some way behind them. </p> <p>Agassi kept the pressure on yesterday by beating Fernando Verdasco 7-6, 6-2 to make the semi-finals of the Stockholm Open. </p> <p>Greg Rusedki also reached the semi-finals in St Petersburg with a 6-4, 7-6 win over Ivo Karlovic. The victory ensures he will finish what has been a difficult year back in the world's top 50.</p>"
