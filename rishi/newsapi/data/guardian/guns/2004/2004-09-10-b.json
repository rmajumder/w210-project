  "<p>Michael Howard and Tony Blair will compete to grab the initiative on climate change next week in speeches promising action to use tax incentives and aid to make renewables an attractive buy for the average household.</p> <p>Michael Howard, who is opposing a wind farm in his Folkestone and Hythe constituency, was expected to endorse the building of new nuclear stations in his speech on Monday but opposition from within his party has led him to water down his proposal. </p> <p>Mr Howard is expected to list a series of measures including a differential stamp duty on house sales to favour energy efficient properties and faster phasing out of HFCs, the chemical used in fridges and air conditioning which also damages the ozone layer. </p> <p>The prime minister, who speaks on Tuesday, had a long meeting with environment groups last week. He was told a repeat of the green speeches he began to make before the 1997 election would raise a hollow laugh unless backed with action. </p> <p>While the prime minister is unlikely to be able to offer anything on the tricky issue of transport, he is expected to announce some boost for renewables and match anything Mr Howard says on one of the great new potential environment areas, micro-generation for households. This is a series of small-scale plants from small wind turbines, solar water heating and electricity to combined heat and power plants and heat pumps. </p> <p>The government has always said these were some way off but the technology has developed so fast it is available now. </p> <p>Both came under attack from the Liberal Democrats, who produced a long list of their failings. </p> <p>Norman Baker, the environment spokesman, said: \"Michael Howard's record shows he truly is the Toxic Tory. In his time as environment secretary he gave an amnesty to water companies polluting rivers and attempted to repeal European environmental legislation. </p> <p>\"Tony Blair's government's record on the environment is woeful. Since Labour came to power carbon emissions from aircraft are up 23%. Labour have shown little interest in green issues, introducing only one debate on the subject in parliament since the last general election. </p> <p>\"Global warming, pollution and threats to wildlife are problems that are worsening daily and cannot be tackled with empty rhetoric. A yearly speech on such a crucial issue is simply not good enough. </p> <p>\"The Liberal Democrats have put forward genuine green alternatives, such as a restructuring of road tax with the most polluting cars paying significantly more.\" </p> <p>In the seven years since Labour came to power progress has been slow or non-existent in many sectors, and targets are not being met - particularly the 20% cut in carbon dioxide emission by 2010. </p> <p>The other major examples are traffic growth and failure to boost electricity production from renewables. Britain also remains close to bottom of the European recycling league. </p> <p>This could prove an embarrassment to Mr Blair because as chairman of the G8 group of leading economies next year he is making climate change and Africa his priorities.</p>",
  "Rather than brave the wrath of jeering pro-hunt protesters outside his County Durham constituency home, Tony Blair invited their leaders inside for a chat yesterday - and blamed backbench pressure for the forthcoming ban on hunting with dogs. <p>In a gesture which clearly caught demonstrators by surprise, he took 15 minutes to explain why the government had decided to bring back the hunting bill next Wednesday, while delaying its implementation for two years. </p> <p>With hunting horns blaring and placards waving around the heavily guarded house, in Trimdon Colliery, one aide joked that the noise was proving a distraction to the prime minister, who enjoys the peace and quiet of the old pit village. </p> <p>A crowd of about 100 had gathered in a nearby street and in a sports field beside the detached house, Myrobella, which doubles as Mr Blair's constituency office and has a large hut outside for a permanent detachment of armed police. </p> <p>Wearing flat caps and waxed jackets, they waved banners - \"Are foxes more important than people?\" and \"Get real MPs\" - as Sam Butler, chairman of the Countryside Alliance, Mark Shotton, master of the South Durham hunt, and three other leading pro-hunt activists went inside to meet the prime minister. \"He listened, which is not the same thing as doing anything about it, but he said there was nothing he could do about preventing next week's bill before the House of Commons,\" Mr Butler said afterwards. </p> <p>\"We impressed upon him that we have for the last seven years been seeking a resolution of this issue. He said he was under a lot of pressure from backbench MPs to ban the sport.\" </p> <p>The promised two-year \"transitional period\" before the ban is introduced - sufficient time, says the government, to find alternative work for the 6,000 or so whose jobs are said to depend on hunting - hardly impressed the five-strong deputation. </p> <p>\"It's like telling someone they are going to be shot to morrow but not today,\" Mr Butler said. \"We will increase political pressure in the run-up to a general election.\" </p> <p>As an opener, Mr Shotton will be back with his hunt on Trimdon village green this morning, conveniently close to the local Labour club where the prime minister sometimes holds his constituency surgery. </p> <p>But ministers, and anti-hunting MPs, will be targeted for similar \"peaceful\" protests over the next few months in what some have labelled \"hit and run\" tactics. </p> <p>On Wednesday, the Country side Alliance says, all 319 hunts in England and Wales will cease operations for the day so that members and supporters can attend a rally in London. They will gather at Westminster at noon and remain until 5.30pm, when a vote is due. Hundreds of hunting horns will then sound. </p> <p>Both the alliance and a more militant splinter group - the Countryside Action Network - insist they are committed to peaceful protest. Yesterday, in Trimdon, police - caught on the hop - said the demonstrators were noisy, but non-violent. But as Mr Blair left Myrobella in a motorcade for a series of constituency engagements, one young protester was arrested. </p> <p>According to Janet George, a leader of the action network who left the alliance amid acrimony in 1998, a series of \"small events\" will take place around the country. </p> <p>\"We are much more speedy,\" she insisted. \"We are a bit more militant, but we have always made it clear that we are not law breakers. However, we have plans which I won't go into.\"</p>",
  "<p>History teaching in Northern Ireland, once riddled with bias and bigotry, is now restrained to the point of blandness, according to research that lambasts it for failing to address the Troubles head on.</p> <p>While the standard of history teaching was considered generally high, certain schools were refusing to tackle the province's more controversial issues, said Alison Kitson, of the Institute of Education at the University of Warwick. In some schools she found there was a tendency to make children aware of different viewpoints without probing the reasons for the differences. </p> <p>According to Ms Kitson, whose paper, History teaching and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, forms part of a wider project on history education in countries emerging from conflict, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that 95% of pupils attend either Catholic \"maintained\" or Protestant \"controlled\" schools. The most segregated areas with the most acute sectarian problems were the areas where teachers were most likely to \"play it safe\" with a bland history curriculum. </p> <p>Pupils attending rural grammar schools in areas with low levels of social tension were more likely to be encouraged to explore areas of historical controversy.</p> <p>Ms Kitson said she understood why teachers in areas on the fringes of paramilitary activity would not want to encourage the discussion of controversial issues. However, she said it was important that history be taught in a progressive manner.</p> <p>\"One of the most important roles of the history classroom can be to enable pupils to explore controversial issues in a safe environment,\" she said.</p> <p>Andy Todd has frontline experience of teaching history in an area emerging from social conflict. As a history teacher at Belfast Boys Model school in the centre of Belfast, he said learning about the Troubles could be hard for some pupils.</p> <p>\"A lot of the boys would like it if we taught about the Troubles, but I wouldn't want to teach about them as it's a bit too close to home,\" he said. \"A lot of pupils have been personally touched by the Troubles and really would only want to hear one side.\"</p> <p>Mr Todd said not all parents would appreciate their children being taught this sensitive subject, although he did concede that history teaching might have a role to play in easing the social tension.</p> <p>\"If the kids understood about other communities' perspectives, it could help make progress and although this is not the sole responsibility of teachers they do have an important role to play.\"</p> <p>Alan McCully, from the school of education at the University of Ulster, agreed that changes needed to take place in the way history was taught in schools. </p> <p>In his research, History, identity and the school history curriculum in Northern Ireland, Mr McCully undertook a study involving 253 children from 10 schools, which measured pupils' reactions to a set of 28 pictures including some images of the Troubles. The pupils were asked to select pictures that were important to them. About 30% of pupils picked out images that were associated with their own community and a further 30% picked out more general images of the Troubles. Others selected pictures not related to the conflict.</p> <p>Older children showed an increased tendency to select pictures depicting their own community, which suggested that as they went through the school system the pupils became more politicised, despite objective, enquiry-based history. Mr McCully now believes dramatic changes are needed to make history teaching more relevant to schoolchildren. </p> <p>\"The past is very well taught in Northern Ireland. However, there is a division in history teaching between those who apply history directly to modern events, and those who do not. There is a need for a flexible history curriculum in which teachers have the freedom to place different emphasis on various subjects in order to challenge prevailing local interpretations,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr McCully believes his findings show that children growing up in Northern Ireland are in danger of learning \"two histories\". He recalled how one male pupil had told him: \"You need to know two histories; one to pass exams and the other to survive out there.\"</p> <p>Davy Hyland, the education spokesman for Sinn Fein, said history teaching on recent events in Northern Ireland was an easy target for criticism, but he was impressed with the current history syllabus.</p> <p>While at school in St Colemans College in Newry, Mr Hyland was taught history with a strong pro-English unionist bias, especially regarding 17 and 18th century British history.</p> <p>\"The accusation can always be made that you are teaching from a biased background,\" he said.</p> <p>Last month, Mr Hyland took part in a BBC Ulster experiment in which he and his counterpart from the Democratic Unionist Party, Sammy Wilson, sat a GCSE history examination that included questions on the history of Northern Ireland. The paper was sat under exam conditions and marked by an independent examiner. Mr Hyland scored 80% and Mr Wilson 64%.</p> <p>\"The questions were stimulating and thought provoking and included probing questions that gave the opportunity to look at both the nationalist and unionist perspectives on the issues,\" said Mr Hyland.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ms Kitson's report is a case study that forms part of a bigger project on history education in countries emerging from conflict for the Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs in New York. Ms Kitson talked to education policy makers in Northern Ireland, interviewed teachers from a cross-section of schools and studied the history textbooks they use.</p>",
  "In the gymnasium where he spent most of his 53 hours as a hostage, 12-year-old Soslan Beteyev mechanically recounts the details of his ordeal. \"They told us if you don't listen to us, if we see you touching the wires [holding the mines], we will kill you. Then they took three children away and shot them,\" he says, gesturing with an arm scabbed over with shrapnel wounds. He barely pauses for breath as he races through the corridors and school rooms. <p>\"Here is where the weapons were hidden, here is where the mines were strung above hostage heads, here is where I was sitting when the first explosion detonated.\" His compulsion to speak is one of the classic symptoms of trauma exhibited by children who survived the terror of Beslan, symptoms which could take years to overcome. </p> <p>Most of the school's 885 students and 56 teachers, as well as parents, grandparents and siblings, were in the schoolyard on September 1 when gunmen herded them inside. More than a week later, a definite list still does not exist. </p> <p>The hostage taking began before the morning rollcall. At least 100 students and 15 teachers are confirmed dead. But at least 60 students are listed as missing, and 53 children lie unidentified in the morgue. Dozens of body fragments will take weeks to be identified through DNA testing. Until then the Russian authorities will not know how many pupils survived. </p> <p>\"We're trying to invite these children to register, to see how many are at home, how many are alive. To find living children, we have advertised on television and we have called all their relatives, friends and acquaintances. This is a small place, everyone knows each other,\" said Vladislav Totrov, the region's deputy education minister. </p> <p>Russian experts estimate it will take most children up to three years to make a complete recovery. Even children who escaped in the first moments, or those who were kept home that day, have suffered psychologically. Some, experts say, are completely withdrawn; others tell their story repeatedly. </p> <p>Worst off are those who were in the gymnasium. Some watched a man shot dead as he tried to calm the children by speaking in Ossetian; others were forced to drink their own urine to quench their thirst and had guns put at their heads. Later, as the mines exploded above and around them, they climbed through windows over dead classmates, only to be hit by shrapnel and shot in their backs and legs as they fled. </p> <p>Zara Medeyeva, 65, who survived the siege with her daughter-in-law, her nine-year-old granddaughter and eight-year-old grandson, said her grandchildren were afraid to return to school. \"My granddaughter sleeps with me. I watch her at night and she is restless in her sleep. Probably she is having nightmares.\" Her grandson was in a daze, she said. </p> <p>Russian federal authorities have sent 10m roubles (\u00a3190,000), with more to come, for therapy for all students, their families and school staff. It will begin with a month at a seaside health retreat; some children, including Soslan, will leave on Monday for Sochi, on the Black Sea coast. </p> <p>The Russian presidential administration and top executives from Russia's richest companies, Gazprom and Norilsk Nickel, have offered the use of their luxurious sanatoriums to survivors. </p> <p>There, as the injured continue physical therapy, psychologists and psychiatrists will counsel children and their families and run art-therapy sessions. Eventually, they will be gently reintroduced to school lessons. \"Many of them say they will never go to school again,\" Mr Totrov said. </p> <p>Later this autumn, children will be redistributed among seven other schools in Beslan, and more therapists will be hired to help them adjust. Middle School No. 1 will be demolished once the investigation is finished and replaced with a memorial to the 350 who died here. Two smaller schools will replace it.</p>",
  "Islamic militants in Iraq are strengthening their grip on the insurgent stronghold of Falluja, four months after American commanders struck a ceasefire deal that was supposed to pacify the city and return it to government control, residents said yesterday. <p>Militants have imposed religious law on communities, issuing edicts and executing those accused of spying and even stealing. </p> <p>US patrols no longer enter the city, 40 miles west of Baghdad, and the Falluja Brigade, a government force established in May to maintain security, was disbanded this week. </p> <p>Large areas of Falluja are now entirely under the control of the insurgents, while other parts are patrolled by police units that sympathise with the militants. </p> <p>A mujahideen shura (or council) has been established, bringing together about 20 leaders from various insurgent groups, often with different aims and tactics. Together, they organise guerrilla tactics against US troops and enforce a hardline Islamic rule of law. </p> <p>\"Nobody can say they are controlling Falluja,\" said Muhammad Hassan al-Balwa, a businessman who was the head of the city council until he resigned when the US launched a major military operation against Falluja in April. \"There are many sectors of power and there is nothing in common between their aims and their slogans.\" </p> <p>\"I told the Americans, 'If the people do not see any change then the resistance will become bigger and stronger'.\" </p> <p>He said the insurgents were divided into three groups: the largest comprises Islamist militants, some following an extremely hardline vision similar to the former Taliban regime in Afghanistan, in which they seek to establish an Islamist caliphate, a second group contains former Ba'ath party members, particularly from the military and elite security forces, and the third is made up of tribal nationalists fighting military occupation. </p> <p>All three agree they want the US military to withdraw from Iraq, but their visions of the country after occupation are unclear and often at odds with each other. </p> <p>For the past year, the city has been at the centre of the Sunni Muslim insurgency that has shaken the US military occupation. More than 600 Iraqis were killed when US troops launched a three-week offensive there in April, but this failed to curb the militancy. </p> <p>\"Falluja is sitting on a volcano, and unless someone tries to release the pressure from the inside it will explode,\" said Dr Balwa. </p> <p>Earlier this week, seven US marines and three Iraqi national guard soldiers were killed just outside Falluja when their convoy was attacked by a car bomber. It was the heaviest death toll in a single attack for months. </p> <p>For three consecutive days this week, the US military has bombed houses in Falluja, targeting what it describes as safe houses linked to the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who is blamed for many of the car bombings and assassinations of the past year. But at the same time, the insurgency has imposed its own law within its community. </p> <p>Several people have been executed for stealing and robbery, said Dr Balwa. Edicts have been issued against theft and car-jacking. For some Iraqis, security has improved. But those seen as collaborators or spies have been punished with kidnapping and execution. </p> <p>On Wednesday, Bassem Muhammad Munajed, the deputy governor of al-Anbar province, which includes Falluja, was kidnapped from his home by masked gunmen. Last month, the militants forced the provincial governor, Abdul Karim Birjis, into a humiliating resignation after his three sons were kidnapped. </p> <p>Days later, US marines arrested the provincial police chief, Ja'adan Muhammad Alwan, who had defected under threat to the insurgency. US military officials said that he was suspected of corruption and possible links to kidnapping and murder. </p> <p>The militants also recently executed Colonel Suleiman Hamad Ifaikhan, the head of the 506 Brigade of the Iraqi national guard, which was based in Falluja. </p> <p>Some observers say the city has become a focal point for foreign anti-American fighters coming to Iraq from states such as Syria and Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>\"Half the people of Falluja don't like these people being there,\" said Sadeq al-Moussawi, a member of the Monarchy party, which has strong connections with local tribes. \"If we want to finish this off, we need intelligence to give us information about each house they use, but the intelligence men they use are from Saddam's regime and we can't trust them.\" </p> <p>Other towns have gone the same way as Falluja. US troops no longer patrol in Ramadi, 20 miles to the west, nor in Tal Afar, a small town just west of Mosul in the north. US troops entered Samarra, just north of Baghdad, only on Thursday for the first time in weeks after an agreement with local officials. </p> <p>To accompany their growing position of strength, Falluja's militants have released a macabre video disc, sold in markets in Falluja and Baghdad, showing prominent captives of the insurgents. </p> <p>One scene shows the sobbing resignation of the provincial governor, Mr Birjis. However, the most disturbing scene, presented by a hardline group said to be run by Mr Zarqawi, shows the execution of an Egyptian man who gives his name as Muhammad Fauzi Abdul A\u00edal Mutwali. </p> <p>He admits spying for the Americans in Falluja and says he was given 45 computer chips that he was told to place in target houses to direct US air strikes. For each chip planted, he was paid $150 (\u00a383). </p> <p>Three men stand behind the Egyptian - two armed with Kalashnikovs and the third with a knife. \"Blessings and peace upon he who implements the judgment by the sword,\" says the third man. </p> <p>\"We are on top of the shoulders of the unclean and the spy traitors, the police and the soldiers who are on the convoy of Satan. Here today we are taking the right of God by slaughtering this criminal.\" </p> <p>He then leans forward and, with the words \"God is greatest\", beheads the Egyptian, placing his severed head on his slumped body.</p>",
  "Ethnic minorities in south Belfast are under police protection this weekend after intelligence warnings that far-right sympathisers were planning attacks on the third anniversary of September 11. <p>Northern Ireland, which is 99% white, is already known as the race-hate capital of Europe, with victims petrol-bombed in the street, cars destroyed, homes petrol-bombed, doors kicked in, crowbar and baseball-bat attacks, stoning, spitting and verbal abuse causing families to flee their homes. </p> <p>Despite international outrage, including a plea from the president of the Philippines about attacks on foreign NHS nurses, the scale and brutality of the attacks has increased. </p> <p>Campaigners have blamed members of loyalist paramilitary groups and far-right groups such as Combat 18 and the White Nationalist Party. There have been three different police warnings of orchestrated attacks in south Belfast in the last few months, one at the height of the Protestant marching season in July. </p> <p>Ethnic minority families and continental Europeans have been forced from their homes in at least five areas, including Belfast, County Armagh and Dungannon in County Tyrone, where Portuguese workers at a chicken factory have been petrol bombed in the street and forced from their homes. </p> <p>The police issued the September 11 warning based on what they termed \"uncorroborated information\". </p> <p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it was encouraging victims to report attacks and was working to secure prosecutions. Officers would be on the alert this weekend. </p> <p>Jamal Iweida, of the Belfast Islamic centre, said the 5,000-strong Muslim community was \"panicky and upset\". Many were already verbally abused more than once a day. Assaults, which had resulted in broken arms and legs, were becoming more brutal. Racist intimidation had put plans for a mosque on hold. </p> <p>Hate crime legislation comes into force in Northern Ireland this month to allow for tougher sentences for racially motivated attacks. But community workers said ethnic minorities did not trust the police to bring prosecutions. There were only eight between April 2003 and April 2004, despite 453 reported incidents. </p> <p>Davy Carlin, of the Anti-Racism Network, which staged a demonstration in south Belfast yesterday afternoon, said: \"There are so many attacks and so few people arrested that minority ethnic communities have little confidence. It is a matter of time before someone else is killed.\" </p> <p>The province saw its first racist murder in April, when an Asian shop owner was beaten to death in County Derry. </p> <p>This summer in south Belfast, Mohammad Hossain, a Bangladeshi restaurant owner, and his family were petrol bombed in their home. He believed the attackers wanted to kill him. It was the 20th time he had been targeted. Three Nigerians fled after a suspect object was found in their garden. </p> <p>One community worker said stone throwing and verbal abuse increasingly came from children. </p> <p>A Unison representative said attacks on foreign health workers were so extreme she feared someone would be killed.</p>",
  "<p>Life is tough at the bottom, according to the boss of Britain's national rail enquiries service, Chris Scoggins. The Bristol-born computer specialist encourages his executives to go back to the floor regularly by manning the phones alongside call centre staff. His stints have proved a chastening experience. </p> <p>\"I find it quite a challenge. It's a difficult job. Our average call is one and a half minutes - that's not long to get into a conversation with the customer and to answer their needs before you're on to the next call.\" </p> <p>The nature of Britain's railway network is such that passengers are not always in the best of moods when they call about the whereabouts of a train. \"I haven't had any actually abusive ones but I've had customers who are very upset about delays and so on - as you do get from time to time,\" says Scoggins. \"That's the biggest challenge for people working in call centres. It can be very stressful when you get upset customers on the end of the line.\" </p> <p>National Rail Enquiries is Britain's busiest telephone number, handling 170,000 calls a day. The service is paid for by train operators at an annual cost of \u00a340m, with each company footing the bill for its share of enquiries. </p> <p>A Cambridge archeology graduate, Scoggins took charge two years ago with a mission to improve a patchy service which had been fined by the rail regulator for poor performance and was yet to delve into the internet. </p> <p>\"To find a whole industry which has relatively little internet application was really quite unique in 2002,\" he recalls, effusing about the need for a \"multi-channel environment\". He has presided over the construction of a website which attracts 2.5m hits a week. </p> <p>A softly spoken, low-key character, Scoggins was initially happy to plug away behind the scenes at improving the service's reliability - he boasts that the average waiting time for callers is 22 seconds, compared to an average in the call centre industry of 71 seconds. However, one morning last year he woke to find himself at the centre of a furore over proposals to outsource a sizeable chunk of operations to India. Documents outlining the plans, leaked to the Guardian, prompted a parliamentary inquiry and allegations from unions that Scoggins was treating staff as \"cannon fodder\". </p> <p>Telephonists in Bangalore, who typically earn little more than \u00a31,800 annually, were being secretly trained by National Rail Enquiries contractor BT to provide information on Britain's notoriously complex transport infrastructure. </p> <p>The move was forecast to save \u00a325m over five years. Scoggins proceeded to dig himself into a hole by insisting money was not the primary motivation. He told MPs Indian workers were often better than their British counterparts, infuriating call centre unions such as Amicus. </p> <p>\"In some aspects they are better in India,\" Scoggins insists. \"In aspects that stem from, I believe, their improved ability to retain and learn information because they have been in full-time education for rather longer than your average UK agent.\" </p> <p>So Indian call centre staff are brighter than their British counterparts? \"Well they have more practice at learning. I don't think they're brighter necessarily. They have more practice at studying complex information and absorbing it and remembering it and recalling it.\" </p> <p>In a further justification to MPs which prompted raised eyebrows, he suggested the power supply in India was more reliable, claiming ten blackouts disrupted the service's call centres in Britain last year. This irritated National Grid Transco, which insisted its network was 99.9999% reliable, with an average of one five-minute outage each decade per customer. </p> <p>Scoggins says he was referring to electricity and telephone outages. He admits that the only reason for India's greater reliability is that call centres have invested in emergency back-up units - which are not considered necessary in Britain. </p> <p>\"Indian operations have had to be extremely cautious in their provision of business continuity measures,\" he says. \"They have multiple levels of back-up power generation on site under their own control with large quantities of fuel.\" </p> <p>National Rail Enquiries is far from alone in using offshore call centres. Since BT's directory enquiry service was deregulated, callers have been directed as far afield as South Africa and the Philippines. Lloyds TSB shifted 750 call centre jobs to India, while travel agencies such as ebookers are almost exclusively dependent on workers in developing countries. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the decision to move National Rail Enquiries has prompted particular scepticism. Critics have queried whether workers 10,000 miles from Britain can really be expected to grasp the difference between an Apex, a supersaver and a first-class standard ticket. Or whether those without local knowledge are best placed to advise on the options for complicated cross-country journeys with bicycle or wheelchair access. </p> <p>Odd British pronunciations could also be an issue. Problems can even arise with native speakers - one Guardian reader recently wrote in to detail his struggle for a refund after a ticket office clerk sold him a ticket to Bolton instead of to Malton. </p> <p>Again, Scoggins believes that those in Bangalore are likely to cope better than their counterparts in Cardiff: \"In India, they are less likely to assume they've heard you correctly and more likely just to ask again and to repeat it back to you to ensure that it's correct. UK agents tend to be more confident and more likely to think they've got the right answer when in fact, maybe they haven't all the time.\" </p> <p>Under a five-year deal which began in February, National Rail Enquiries contracted out its call centres to BT and Ventura in an agreement worth \u00a380m. So far, just over 100 jobs have been shifted to call centres in Mumbai and Bangalore, A further 1,400 work in Cardiff, Derby, Newcastle and Plymouth. By the autumn, half of all calls will go to the subcontinent. Amicus says this could cost up to 700 jobs. </p> <p>Scoggins claims staff are likely to be redeployed to other companies. \"Some of the savings will enable us to invest in providing better information to passengers. Any savings beyond that would end up in increased premium payments by train firms to the Strategic Rail Authority and a decrease in the subsidy requirement.\" </p> <p>Is it really desirable for bright young graduates from a developing country to channel their talents into answering the telephone to frustrated British commuters? Particularly at salaries far short of Britain's minimum wage? </p> <p>\"I'm not sure of the development path planned for Indian society, but one would imagine that as the country develops, they will have more opportunities. </p> <p>\"There's a long held tradition of work which used to be done in the western world moving to developing nations. I don't see this as any different.\" </p> <p>Back home, National Rail Enquiries is working on a new service providing real-time information by text message to passengers' mobile phones. The service attracted 10,000 complaints from customers last year, though Scoggins says the rate has since fallen by a quarter. He says \"mystery shopper\" research commissioned internally suggests that 97% of callers get correct information. </p> <p>The Rail Passenger' Council is sceptical about the accuracy of answers to more complicated calls. As well as offering train times, National Rail Enquiries is supposed to provide information about fares, accessibility, delays, the eligibility of railcards and group discounts. In a survey two years ago, the RPC found only 34% of complex calls were answered correctly. </p> <p>Scoggins says the study was two years ago and was unfair: \"It was specifically about people travelling with a bicycle during engineering works with replacement buses on a specific route on days over a fares change.\" </p> <p>A daily commuter on South West Trains from Winchester to Waterloo, Scoggins says he does not carry any train times in his head. He rejects the notion that the jobs on offer in his call centres are boring: \"If you really engage with each customer and try to attend to their individual needs, you'll get a higher level of job satisfaction than if you treat them in the most minimal way.\" </p> <p>Scoggins points out that the flexible hours are particularly attractive for those with children or in part-time study: \"Call centre work in the UK provides opportunities for meaningful employment for people who have specific needs which don't fit a nine-to-five sort of a job.\" </p> <p>So if one of his children decided to be a call centre worker, would he be a proud father? \"I'd be proud of them as long as they were happy. I started work in a school uniform shop - folding clothes after hours.\"</p>",
  "<p>Shares in <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> fell 109p to \u00a325.10 yesterday on news that its potential blockbuster drug offering stroke prevention, Exanta, might face delays in getting American approval. </p> <p>Clinical trial results are being scrutinised by the US food and drug administration, which is due to make a decision this year. </p> <p>A panel of doctors and scientists will quiz AstraZeneca officials about the drug today, on behalf of the FDA. The agenda for the meeting was put on the regulator's website yesterday and revealed that FDA staff have highlighted safety and effectiveness issues with the drug. It has potentially negative effects on the liver and the FDA staff highlighted a possible risk of increased heart attacks. </p> <p>Exanta has potential as a blockbuster because the standard drug used now, warfarin, is complicated and has unpleasant side effects. </p> <p>Analysts had been upgrading the stock ahead of an ex pected approval of Exanta. Research out on Wednesday from Lehman Brothers analyst Stewart Adkins warned that the approval of Exanta was already taken into account in the share price, yet there were outstanding safety concerns that might delay FDA approval. </p> <p>In letters to the Lancet journal in February, a succession of scientists questioned the effectiveness of the drug and the design of AstraZeneca's clinical trials. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 index was down 20.4 points at 4538, with much of the drag coming after a profit warning from Compass wiped more than a quarter off its share value.

Persistent rumours of a link with the man who tried and failed to take over Safeway last year came as Sainsbury's shares rose 7.75p to close at 277p. </p> <p>This despite a stinging report from credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's describing Sainsbury's as having \"strong pressure on market share ... lesser operating efficiency [than rivals] and inadequate price positioning\". </p> <p>Among smaller stocks, <strong>Eldridge Pope</strong> announced it was in discussions with SDA, a company controlled by Michael Cannon, more than a year after the acquisitive pub entrepreneur began building a stake in the Dorset-based firm. </p> <p>A year ago, the then chairman of Eldridge Pope, Christopher Pope, was apopleptic at the tender offer through which Mr Cannon was taking an interest in the troubled business. Nevertheless, the unwelcome entrepreneur obtained a 22% holding. </p> <p>A year on, and Mr Pope has been replaced by Miles Templeman, the former Whitbread man brought in last year by West Country cider maker HP Bulmer to run that family-controlled business. Months later he had brokered a sale to Scottish &amp; Newcastle. </p> <p>The founding family at Eldridge Pope controls about 30% of shares and is remaining tight lipped. Nevertheless, relations between Mr Templeman and Mr Cannon, are believed to be friendly. </p> <p>Yesterday, shares in Eldridge Pope were up 15.5p at 168.5p. Mr Cannon last bought at 171p. </p> <p><strong>Avesco</strong>, which supplies video screens for pop concerts, corporate and sporting events, including the Olympics, was up 10.5p at 75p. Its chairman, Ian Martin, told a shareholder meeting yesterday that the group had enjoyed \"an excellent start to the year\". </p> <p>\"Both our revenue and profit figures ... [for the first half] were ahead ... and considerably better than our expectations at the start of the year,\" he said. In July Mr Martin bought 50,000 shares at 51p. </p> <p><strong>Metnor</strong>, the Tyneside metal galvanizing business, was down 38.5p at 171.5p. It blamed a lumpy pipeline of contracts for a dismal first-half performance, insisting several contract completions had fallen into the final six months of 2004. </p> <p>Nevertheless, profits will be down on last year by the year-end and below expectations, the company said. </p> <p><strong>Aga Foodservice Group</strong> was up 2.25p at 227.5p after the company announced it had acquired the three factories and stock from bankrupt French bakery oven maker Pavailler for \u20ac2.5m (\u00a31.7m). The operations acquired achieved a turnover of \u20ac32m and came close to breaking even in 2003. </p> <p>Pavailler will be integrated into Aga's existing French business, Bongard, the market leader, with the loss of 60 jobs. However, there are persistent reports of unrest among French unions, some of which have suggested workers will strike should Aga take control of Pavailler. </p> <p>Aga said yesterday its offer had been the only one on the table and the deal had been approved by a workers' council vote. Some 220 jobs have been retained and Aga \"plans to grow the business\", a spokeswoman said. </p> <p><strong>Biocompatibles</strong> gained 8.5p at 190p after it accompanied in-line interim losses with news that the food and drug administration had cut the level of testing it requires on the company's main product, Bead Block, a cancer therapy. </p> <p><strong>Ebookers in sale talks</strong></p> <p>Ebookers jumped 45.25p to 230p after the online travel group said it was in talks with a umber of potential suitors that might lead to sale of the business. </p> <p>Shares have struggled to recover from a 30% slump in July after the group, which specialises in mid- and long-haul destinations, announced it would miss its profits target this year. </p> <p>Last year, US media baron Barry Diller, who controls rival website Expedia as well as Hotels.com and Ticketmaster, was said to have shown an interest in both Ebookers and <a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a>.</p>",
  "The US treasury secretary, John Snow, had an important message for the people of Florida when he addressed the Greater Boca Raton chamber of commerce last month. <p>George Bush's administration was leading a strong economic recovery, Mr Snow claimed; its tax cuts had worked wonders for small businesses. Look at Mug-a-Bug Pest Control Inc. of Lawrenceville, Georgia, he urged. </p> <p>\"Mug-a-Bug report that homeowners who had previously cancelled their quarterly pest control service during the slow days of the economy reinstated the service after tax cuts went into effect,\" Mr Snow declared. Mug-a-Bug had since purchased five new vehicles and hired three new employees. </p> <p>An alternative explanation for Mug-a-Bug's success is that, under Mr Bush, creepy-crawlies are on the rise. But no matter. As November's presidential vote approaches, the Republicans are once again throwing everything they've got at Florida, the state that delivered the White House to Mr Bush in 2000 by a mere 537 votes. </p> <p>The highlight of Mr Snow's speech was the US embargo on Cuba. \"The objectives of US policy towards Cuba are clear,\" he said. \"Bring an end to the ruthless and brutal dictatorship; assist the Cuban people in a transition to representative democracy; and assist in establishing a free market economy.\" </p> <p>Mr Snow listed a series of toughened sanctions on Cuba, designed to reinforce the 1963 US embargo. The measures include tighter restrictions on remittances and travel to the island. </p> <p>Visits by US-based exiles to family members in Cuba, for example, are limited to one trip of no more than 14 days every three years, with no exceptions for illness or bereavement. </p> <p>In another blow for freedom, the treasury department's office of foreign assets control (Ofac) stipulates that no US visitor may spend more than $50 a day in Cuba - for fear of lining Fidel Castro's pockets. </p> <p>Gifts deemed to be non-essential by the lifestyle gurus of the treasury are also outlawed under the Trading with the Enemy Act. </p> <p>\"Not more than one parcel may be sent or given by the same person in the US to the same recipient in Cuba in any one calendar month,\" the regulations state. \"Medical supplies and devices\" are allowed and so too, for some reason, are \"veterinary medicines, fishing supplies and soap-making equipment\". But luxuries are out. Total parcel value \"must not exceed $200\". The likes of Mug-a-Bug Inc certainly cannot do business in Havana. The penalty for violating the regulations is up to 10 years in jail and $1m in fines. </p> <p>Mr Snow noted that Ofac enforces US sanctions on a total of 29 \"rogue nations\" worldwide. But Cuba gets special treatment, he bragged. \"Because of its proximity and distinctive relationship with the US, [Cuba] has a unique and critical sanction programme which receives strict attention.\" </p> <p>To the outside world, US policy towards Cuba seems unjust. But the electoral significance of Mr Snow's performance is clear. Cuba is hot politics in Florida. The state's population of 2.68 million Hispanics accounts for 16.8% of the vote. </p> <p>In the 2000 election Cuban-Americans favoured Mr Bush by more than four to one - a striking, possibly decisive, bias in an otherwise even contest. Republicans hope to repeat the trick on November 2 and tough talk and actions such as Mr Snow's new sanctions will help them to do so - or so the argument goes. </p> <p>Mr Bush has been busy waging his anti-Castro campaign on other fronts, too. His Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba, set up last year, has been developing plans to destabilise the Cuban government and manage a transition \"from Stalinist rule to a free and open society\". </p> <p>Mr Bush also claims to have broken \"the Castro regime's information blockade\" by beaming previously jammed radio and TV broadcasts into the island from a national guard aircraft circling overhead. </p> <p>\"The Cuban people are hearing the truth once again,\" he told a campaign rally in Miami last month. \"They should be free from the tyrant.\" Mr Bush was back in Florida this week. </p> <p>This flurry of administration activity has its roots in complaints last year by Cuban-Americans that Mr Bush had broken his promise in 2000 to get tough on Mr Castro. Republicans began to worry they might switch their votes to the Democrats' John Kerry. </p> <p>Egged on by Mr Bush's brother, Jeb Bush, Florida's Republican governor, the White House jumped into action. But now, voices within this same Cuban-American community are complaining that the travel and other sanctions go far too far and penalise ordinary families. </p> <p>The president's hardline policy, refurbished for the election season, may yet backfire on him.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Armistice 1918</strong> (Sketch, \u00a322.99) by Bill Carrothers, is a poetic story of love and separation, told partly through the songs of that time. At first glance, the first world war seems an unpromising subject for an extended jazz suite: the era seems too distant from the angular and elastic rhythms of the 21st-century piano trio. Yet the subject matter is still close, particularly for those of us whose grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought in the first world war, with diaries and souvenirs and family photos to keep their young faces fresh in our memories. And if it is true, as Carrothers claims, that \"the 20th century was officially born\" when the Armistice was signed in November 1918, we still have another 14 years to run of this murderous century.</p> <p>There are a number of well established musical motifs for the first world war: jolly songs like Pack Up Your Troubles; lonely harmonicas; military brass and marching drums. Soundtrack composers are often called upon to deliver both pathos and bombast. Orlando Gough's music for Killing Fields, the Great War episode of the BBC series People's Century, and for the first world war series shown last year on Channel 4, used both chugging minimalism and icy modernism to imply the inner workings of the war machine. Peter Weir's Gallipoli made memorable use of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings; Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory used the skull-rattling snare drums of Gerald Fried's score to focused effect; while Joan Littlewood used popular songs of the era in ironic juxtaposition in her ground-breaking Oh What a Lovely War!, brilliantly revived at the Roundhouse several years ago.</p> <p>Carrothers, however, is a thoughtful jazz pianist working with a small group - no orchestral forces, harmonicas, documentary soundfiles or theatrical alienation for him. Instead, he has crafted an intelligent suite: songs from the era; original compositions; group improvisations; and a version of Silent Night to represent the famous temporary, unofficial truce of Christmas Day, 1914. Where sung, the songs are performed by a small male voice choir, or by Carrothers' wife Peg. But the dominant sound is that of solo piano or piano trio, with drummer Bill Stewart and bassist Drew Gress, and Carrothers makes clever use of additional instrumental colours: cellist Matt Turner, percussionist Jay Epstein and Mark Henderson on contrabass clarinet, plus Peg's haunting, pure tones, often deployed in direct contrast to the warm timbres of the rhythm section.</p> <p>At first, I didn't get it: Hello Ma Baby seemed annoying and mannered; the waltz-time rhythms of Let Me Call You Sweetheart felt arch and unmusical. It wasn't until I got to the second CD that I began to understand the scope of Bill Carrothers ambitions. This disc opens with Peg's rendition of Till We Meet Again, accompanied by tiny, improvised percussion sounds, and moves into a solo piano version of Roses of Picardy. The mood darkens for a sequence of ensemble pieces, with programmatic titles such as Evening Stand-To and No-Man's Land, before broadening into a reharmonised version of It's a Long Way to Tipperary. This rocks along with just the right blend of grit and optimism.</p> <p>Carrothers' research has unearthed some of the most unlikely jazz cover versions you will find, including I'm Afraid to Come Home in the Dark, Keep the Home Fires Burning and Cuddle Up a Little Closer. Some treatments don't gel, but in general, the musicality of his interpretations draws attention to the quality of these old tunes by stripping away the sentimental accompaniment. The two-hour suite ends with a devastating version of Novello and Ford's I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier set in two different key signatures. Sung simply by Peg Carrothers, it's as moving an anti-conflict statement as any this past century: \"Let nations arbitrate their future troubles/ It's time to lay the sword and gun away/There'd be no war today/if mothers all would say/I didn't raise my boy to be a soldier.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Bob Dylan</strong><br> I was asked to give a statement on Johnny's passing and thought about writing a piece instead called Cash is King, because that is the way I really feel. In plain terms, Johnny was and is the North Star; you could guide your ship by him - the greatest of the greats, then and now. I first met him in 1962, or 63, and saw him a lot in those years. In some kind of way he was with me more than people I see every day. </p> <p>There wasn't much music media in the early 1960s, and Sing Out! was the magazine covering all things folk in character. The editors had published a letter chastising me for the direction my music was going. Johnny wrote the magazine back an open letter telling the editors to shut up and let me sing, that I knew what I was doing. This was before I had ever met him, and the letter meant the world to me. I've kept the magazine to this day. </p> <p>Of course, I knew of him before he ever heard of me. In 1955 or 56, I Walk the Line played all summer on the radio, and it was different from anything else you had ever heard. The record sounded like a voice from the middle of the earth. It was so powerful and moving. It was profound, and so was the tone of it, every line; deep and rich, awesome and mysterious all at once. I Walk the Line had a monumental presence and a certain type of majesty that was humbling. Even a simple line like \"I find it very, very easy to be true\" can take your measure. We can remember that and see how far we fall short of it. </p> <p>Johnny wrote thousands of lines like that. Truly, he is what the land and country are all about, the heart and soul of it personified and what it means to be here; and he said it all in plain English. I think we can have recollections of him, but we can't define him any more than we can define a fountain of truth, light and beauty. If we want to know what it means to be mortal, we need look no further than the Man in Black. Blessed with a profound imagination, he used the gift to express all the various lost causes of the human soul. </p> <p>This is a miraculous and humbling thing. Listen to him, and he always brings you to your senses. He rises high above all, and he'll never die or be forgotten, even by persons not yet born - especially those persons - and that is for ever. </p> <p><strong> Bono</strong><br> Every man could relate to him. But nobody could be him. To be that extraordinary and that ordinary was his real gift. That, and his humour and his bare-boned honesty. When I visited him at home one time, he said the most beautiful, poetic grace. He said: \"Shall we bow our heads?\" We all bowed our heads. Then, when he was done, he looked at me and Adam Clayton and said: \"Sure miss the drugs, though.\" It was just to say: \"I haven't become a Holy Joe.\" He just couldn't be self-righteous. I think he was a very godly man, but you had the sense that he had spent his time in the desert. And that just made you like him more. It gave his songs some dust. And that voice was definitely locusts and honey. </p> <p>I was telling somebody just the other day: \"We're all sissies in comparison to Johnny Cash.\" And he was a zookeeper, too. Did you know he was nearly killed by an emu on his property? He told me: \"That emu damn near killed me. I defended myself with a post.\" But he was laughing as he told the story. </p> <p>So Johnny Cash passed away after seeing off the love of his life. That's such a different outcome than death by emu. We should be grateful. </p> <p><strong> Al Gore</strong><br> When I was elected to Congress 27 years ago, my district included Johnny Cash's home in Hendersonville, 25 minutes north of Nashville. Back then, there was only one personal connection, through June Carter Cash, whom my father had known when she was a girl performing with her legendary family on WSM radio. </p> <p>As I got to know Johnny Cash the man, I loved his music much more - not for the normal reason that you appreciate the work of your friends, but because it was just obvious at close range that what made his songs so great was that the man himself was deep, deep, deep. He had felt a lot of pain in his life (though he told me that the worst pain he ever felt was when he lost June). But midway through his life, he found the strength to learn from his mistakes, acknowledge them honestly and transcend them. </p> <p>And maybe because of what he had gone through, he felt a deep connection to the suffering of others. He was to the left of me on many issues; for example, he was against the death penalty. He cared about social conditions and wanted laws and policies that would help the poor and disadvantaged. You could always tell when he talked about what was going on in America that he cared most of all for those who have a tough row to hoe. </p> <p>To my ears, his songs have always been beautiful, powerful and moving in a completely original way. His music will grow considerably in stature as time passes. That unusually strong connection between the soul of the artist and the integrity of his art will lift it up and set it apart, and its rare beauty will be more readily recognised, because it draws its power from that shimmering link between song and soul. </p> <p><strong> Emmylou Harris</strong><br> I was doing a show with Neil Young in Nashville just after Johnny died. Before the show, Neil was telling me how sorry he was about Johnny. And at the end of Rockin' in the Free World, Neil played Taps on the guitar. It was beautiful. </p> <p>John seemed so completely American, if I may say that in a time of such turmoil that I'm not sure we know who we are as a people. He seemed to be the voice of truth in everything he did. There was nothing unnatural about John Cash - this was not an act. He rose to the occasion on The Man Comes Around in a way that was astonishing. And the video they made of Hurt puts all those bare-navel, soft-porn videos to shame. It shows videos can actually have a profound effect on us, and it took Johnny Cash to once again show that. It's come full circle, because when he first came on the scene with that power, he was all that rock'n'roll could be. </p> <p><strong> Jerry Lee Lewis</strong><br> I did the first tour ever with Johnny Cash - way back in 1956. It was me, him and Carl Perkins, a 30-day tour all the way through Canada, and there weren't any paved highways or anything, nothing but gravel roads. I remember what a great showman Johnny was. The way he sang was completely different, and he had a whole different style that he created himself. John, Elvis and them were rockabilly; I was rock'n'roll. But we all had country in us, which manifested itself in different ways. If you break it all down to the nitty-gritty, we're all country people. We were called rebels - I guess because we were. Whatever we took a notion to, we just did it. John was religious thinking, if not always religious-acting. One of the most ridiculous things Johnny and I ever did was steal a television set out of a hotel; there was a little bitty television up on the wall, and we got it off. Johnny wanted it for his wife; I helped him get it, because I didn't see any reason why he shouldn't have it. </p> <p>I hope when his heart quit beatin' that he was ready to meet his maker. I don't know if he was; I'm not the judge. He was a man of faith, which I think should help. I just hope he made it through the gates. </p> <p><strong> Sheryl Crow</strong><br> I sang at John's funeral, and I cannot lie: it was very hard. There was a real sense we had turned a corner. Because there can never be another Johnny Cash. I grew up in a place where people were very God-fearing, land-loving, and John represented the salt of the earth to me. He spoke for every man and personified the human struggles that we all go through. He was almost biblical, because he walked this earth and experienced all a man could suffer. Yet he still rose up out of the ashes with this great strength and gave voice to that strength for all of us. </p> <p><strong> Steve Earle</strong><br> Johnny was one of the few people who wrote me when I was locked up - he sent me a very encouraging letter saying how everybody was pulling for me, that he and June were praying for me and that he would see me when I got out. I saw him again when I helped put together the band for his song on the Dead Man Walking soundtrack. When I got to the studio, nobody was there but John and the engineer. I walk in and there's this old-fashioned picnic basket sitting in the middle of the pool table - you know, gingham tablecloth, the whole bit. John's got his hand in that picnic basket, and he looks up and says: \"Steve, would you like a piece of tenderloin on a biscuit that June made this morning?\" I was really hungry, so I said: \"Yeah.\" And he said: \"I knew you would.\" </p> <p>We could've talked about our shared demons (I'd been clean probably a year and a half) but he knew that sometimes it's better to leave some things private and just talk about tenderloin and biscuits. </p> <p><strong> Tom Petty</strong><br> The first time I met John was in 1982 - I was with Nick Lowe, who was his son-in-law at the time, and we were in Nashville. John invited us to have a meal at his place out on the lake. We arrived, but we were disappointed, because John had taken ill that morning and had gone to the hospital with pneumonia - him and June. But the meal was still going to go on. We sat at this long, elaborately set table. Just as the meal was about to begin, someone said: \"Tom, John's on the phone and would like to talk to you.\" So I went to the phone and we talked for, God, about half an hour. Then after dinner, he and June spoke to every single guest by phone as they left the house and asked if they had a good time. </p> <p>When John came out to Los Angeles to make Unchained, me and the Heartbreakers kind of became his band. I still view that as the best work we ever did. Once, at this studio in downtown Hollywood, John came in with June. He was laughing, so I said: \"Hey, where you been?\" He said: \"June and I thought it would be fun to just sit on that bus bench across the street for a while. I met the most interesting people over there.\" </p> <p>I was trying to picture the look on these people's faces as they came to wait for the bus and there's Johnny and June. This guy was friends with presidents, and he was friends with people at the bus stop. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Cash: A Tribute to Johnny Cash by the Editors of Rolling Stone is published by Virgin Books Ltd at \u00a319.99.

  "The death, at the age of 86, of the elder statesman of America's white supremacists, Pastor Richard Butler, marks a generational shift in the movement's leadership, and possibly an ideological switch from its distorted version of Christianity towards Scandinavian paganism. <p>Butler, the head of his self-created Church of Jesus Christ Christian, and its political wing, the Aryan Nations, presided over his 20-acre \"world headquarters of the white race\" in rural northern Idaho from 1974 to 2000, when he lost a law suit and was forced into bankruptcy. </p> <p>His church then fragmented. Within two years, it was facing competition from a rival church in Pennsylvania, a move that seemed to end the ailing Butler's dream of establishing a \"white quarter\" in the US Pacific north-west. Despite apparently having lost everything, however, he continued to live in a house bought for him by a rich Silicon Valley entrepreneur and admirer, though he did little more than update his elaborate website. </p> <p>A younger generation, typified by the skinheads ardently recruited by Butler and the racist ideologue William Pierce (obituary, July 25 2002) - the man whose book inspired the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing - seemed keener on the cult of Odin, as favoured by their fellow neo-Nazis in Europe. This Scandinavian supreme god and creator offered a more exciting myth - as well as rock music - than the bizarre Christian theology promoted by Butler and his kind. </p> <p>He preached that the \"Aryan\" nations of northern Europe and their American and Canadian emigrants, were really the 10 lost tribes of Israel. Jews, he claimed, were descended from a union between Eve and Satan, and non-white people were subhuman and lacked a soul. Ironically, this mish-mash of racist nonsense had its origins in the 19th-century British-Israelite movement. </p> <p>In the US, Butler's neo-Nazi theories had a wider influence than his supporters' tiny numbers suggested. He helped to foment racial violence in American jails with his so-called prison ministry, though unlike many of his followers, he himself was never incarcerated. In 1988, a trial for seditious conspiracy against the US government ended in his acquittal, along with that of 13 others. </p> <p>Butler was born in rural Colorado, the son of an Anglo-German machinist and his wife, and, at an early age, listened to his father's anti-semitic stories. Years later, he recalled reading, at the age of 11, a magazine story entitled The Red Napoleon about a mixed-race Bolshevik conquest of the US, which left a deep impression on him. </p> <p>The great depression forced his family to move to Los Angeles, and, after high school, he studied aeronautical engineering at Los Angeles City College. He found a job with an aviation company, and was sent to Bangalore to service aircrafts for the Royal Indian Air Force. As an honorary officer, he was given a Hindu batman, and, the story goes, the two became friends, with Butler listening avidly to his servant's talk of the caste system and racial purity. </p> <p>Returning to the US in 1941, Butler married the former Betty Litch. They had two daughters, who both later rejected father's politics, but Betty remained loyal until her death in 1995. </p> <p>After the war, which Butler spent working in military aviation technology in America, he got a job at the Lockheed plant at Lancaster, near Los Angeles. Then, in 1961, he and Betty began attending the Church of the Anglo-Saxon Christian Congregation, headed by Dr Wesley Swift, a former Ku Klux Klan member. </p> <p>Swift taught Butler about the Christian Identity move ment, while his political mentor was Swift's friend, Colonel William Potter Gale, a former aide to General Douglas MacArthur and a founding member of the violently racist Posse Comitatus. Swift then formed the white supremacist Christian Defence League, of which Butler became national director. By 1968, he had been ordained by a mail-order theology school. </p> <p>In 1974, with money he made from a patent, Butler moved to an old farmhouse at Hayden Lake, Idaho, founded his own church, built a chapel decorated with a bust of Hitler, installed guards on a watch tower and posted a notice declaring \"Whites Only\" at the gate. From 1981, visitors to the annual junkets of what he called the World Congress of Aryan Nations, amounted to a who's who of American neo-Nazis and racist Christians. The church insignia sported a sword with a swastika-like bar across it, and the congresses ended with a cross burning ceremony, reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan. To complete the mood, Butler deployed his Alsatian guard dogs, Hans, Nazi and Fritz. </p> <p>During the 1980s, members of the Butler church and associates of Pierce's National Alliance formed a violent group called the Order, which robbed banks and an armoured truck that yielded $3.2m, some of which proceeds allegedly went to Butler. He refused to condemn these actions, and Betty told the press: \"He wouldn't spank a puppy dog.\" </p> <p>Butler's ruin began when his guards fired on a mother and son who had paused outside his church in 1998. The Southern Poverty Law Centre, a powerful human rights group, mounted a civil law suit on behalf of the pair, and, in a deliberate attempt to bankrupt Butler, won an award of $6.3m in 2000. The compound was bought by a Massachusetts human rights group, and Butler moved into his benefactor's house. His days as the most visible white supremacist in America were over. </p> <p>But he remained defiant into his 80s, appearing as recently as last July with a band of 40 neo-Nazis and Aryan Nations members, who waved racist flags and shouted abuse at anti-racist demonstrators during the annual Aryan World Congress meeting. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Richard Gernt Butler, neo-Nazi, born February 23 1918; died September 8 2004</p>",
  "This week's Japanese papers were lukewarm in their response to government plans to privatise the country's unwieldy postal service from April 2007. Privatisation would see Japan Post split into four initially state-run corporations, each responsible for running a different service but under a single holding company. <p>The <b>Asahi Shimbun</b> was unhappy with the pace of reform and at the prospect of the new entities enjoying a period of mollycoddling by the state. \"Postal privatisation should not lead to a reckless expansion of services,\" it said. \"If the state-run enterprise is allowed to diversify its operations greatly to protect its network and jobs before full privatisation, this initiative will become a curse rather than a boon to the private sector.\" </p> <p>Privatisation should be allowed to take its natural course, reckoned the <b>Yomiuri Shimbun</b>, which was also concerned that no timetable had been set for the sale of government shares in the four corporations. In fact, the paper was far from convinced that the state was ready to relinquish its stake due to its addiction to controlling huge sums of cash generated by the private sector - a practice it denounced as \"financial socialism\". </p> <p>A similar view was shared by the <b>Nikkei</b> financial weekly. \"Expansion of the scope of [the new firms'] businesses should be linked to the reduction of government involvement,\" it said, before urging the state to sell its stake in Japan Post \"as soon as possible\" after 2007. </p> <p>The press also expressed anger at South Korea's admission last week that government scientists had produced a tiny quantity of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium in 2000. </p> <p>\"The actions of the South Korean institute make a mockery of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty,\" the Asahi said, adding that the news could \"deprive the west of its rationale for pressing North Korea to completely dismantle its suspected nuclear weapons programme\". </p> <p>The Yomiuri scoffed at Seoul's claim that the government had no knowledge of the scientists' actions. The way South Korea dealt with the case \"deepens the international community's suspicions about its nuclear policy\", it reckoned. </p> <p>The <b>Japan Times</b> was prepared to believe South Korean claims that it had no intention of seeking to build a nuclear weapon. But the admission was \"very disturbing\", not least because of the message it sends to Pyongyang. \"Nuclear dominoes may start to fall. North Korea is likely to argue that it must match any South Korean capability,\" it said. </p> <p>Although Seoul should be applauded for coming clean, conceded the paper, \"it should also be shamed for insufficient control over its nuclear programme. Rogue nuclear experiments are nothing to laugh at.\" </p> <p>There was little mirth, either, at the prospect of professional baseball players laying down their bats and gloves this weekend and going on strike for the first time in the 70-year history of the game in Japan. The Yomiuri, which owns the country's most popular baseball club - the Giants - said the players would leave an indelible \"black mark\" against the sport if they went ahead with industrial action called to protest against the proposed merger between two cash-strapped teams in the Osaka region. </p> <p>It was not the place of the players to question the club owners' decision on Wednesday to give the merger their blessing, it said. The paper's unmistakable message: \"Play ball.\" </p> <p>Though others expressed support for the players -whose futures will be in the balance if the merger takes place - most sympathised with the millions of baseball fans. \"If the strike goes ahead, it will leave people disillusioned and drive even more of them away,\" reckoned the <b> Mainichi Shimbun</b>. </p> <p>The Asahi called for common sense to prevail, warning that the strike, though planned only for weekends during September, would cause irreparable harm to the game's reputation. \"Should this whole affair turn into a mud-slinging contest,\" it noted, \"the already significant decline in baseball's popularity will only worsen.\" </p> <p>An economist, quoted in the <b>Yukan Fuji</b>, said the game would lose \u00a55bn (\u00a336m) in ticket and merchandise sales, and broadcasting rights if the strike went ahead. </p> <p>Fans aside, the tabloid spared a thought for another group dependent on the sport for their wellbeing: \"This weekend could be miserable for the girls who earn pocket money selling beer in the stands.\"</p>",
  "An 86-year-old Nazi death squad commander went on trial in Munich yesterday, accused of the slaughter of 164 Slovak villagers in what could turn out to be the last war crimes trial from the second world war. <p>Ladislav Niznansky is accused of heading the Slovak section of the Edelweiss unit, which hunted partisans and Jews in Czechoslovakia after Germany crushed an uprising against its puppet government. </p> <p>Mr Niznansky is accused of taking part in the massacre of 146 people in two Slovakian villages in 1945 and later ordering the execution of 18 Jews, some of them children, who were discovered hiding nearby. </p> <p>He told the court that he was also a partisan, but changed sides after being captured when a German officer threatened to send him to a concentration camp. </p> <p>A pale-faced Mr Niznansky told reporters: \"I am not guilty\" as he arrived at the first hearing yesterday. </p> <p>Born Czechoslovakian, Mr Niznansky is thought to have escaped to Germany in 1948. He was given German nationality in 1996. </p> <p>For 33 years he lived openly with his wife in a Munich suburb, and he worked for decades at the US-government backed Radio Free Europe, which broadcast into communist-controlled Czechoslovakia. </p> <p>But his quiet life was interrupted on January 16 this year when police officers rang his doorbell and charged him with 164 counts of murder. Munich prosecutors say they began investigating Mr Niznansky in 2001 after being approached by the Slovakian government. </p> <p>A court in Czechoslovakia convicted Mr Niznansky of the massacre and other killings in 1962 and sentenced him to death in absentia. </p> <p>Prosecutors accuse him of ordering the Edelweiss team to round up and shoot 146 people from the villages of Klak and Ostry Grun on January 21 1945. Prosecutors say the victims included 51 children, with the youngest three months old. </p> <p>Mr Niznansky \"ordered that no living soul be allowed to escape and that anyone who tried to flee be shot\", and personally killed at least 20 people, the indictment says. </p> <p>His lawyer denies that Mr Niznansky was at Ostry Grun and Klak at the time of the killings. </p> <p>\"The aim of the operation was the total destruction of the villages and the liquidation of all their inhabitants, because there were partisans there who were supported by the population,\" the indictment said. </p> <p>Mr Niznansky is also accused of forming an execution detail two weeks later which shot 18 Jews who had been found hiding in bunkers in nearby Ksina. </p> <p>His defence lawyer, Steffen Ufer, said in his opening statement that Mr Niznansky was under orders from Nazi superiors and not present when most of the shootings happened. \"He never gave an order to move against women and children, nor did he personally lift his hand against such persons,\" Mr Ufer said in an opening statement. </p> <p>Despite the passage of nearly 60 years, the prosecution plans to bring 24 witnesses - some of them survivors of the shootings - to testify against Mr Niznansky. </p> <p>Efraim Zuroff, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Israel, which helped to find the witnesses, said that under German law pleading \"under orders\" was not a justification, although courts have been sympathetic in the past. </p> <p>Dr Zuroff said there were still thousands of Nazis in hiding across Europe. The centre launched its Last Chance campaign two years ago, to find and prosecute Nazi war criminals. Mr Niznansky was number four on its \"most wanted\" list. </p> <p>The trial is expected to finish in October.</p>",
  "<p> <strong> Shane</strong> </p> <p>(George Stevens, 1953) 6pm, FilmFour</p> <p> A five-star classic western, adapted from Jack Schaefer's fine novel and firmly grounded in the Wyoming range wars. Buckskin-clad Alan Ladd is Shane, the stranger looking for honest labour with the homesteaders but forced into fighting their cause against ruthless rancher Emile Meyer and his hired gun, grinning Jack Palance. This is one of the great showdowns, but what elevates the film is Shane's complex emotional impact on the homesteading family: friendly rivalry with staunch Van Heflin; would-be lover of the wife (Jean Arthur); and, of course, the hero of her boy (Brandon de Wilde). </p> <p><strong> Training Day</strong> </p> <p>(Antoine Fuqua, 2001) 10pm, Sky Movies 1</p> <p> Ethan Hawke's rookie cop has a hellish first 24 hours in an elite LA narcotics squad: not so much because of the traditional gallery of drug-runners, gangsters, muggers and rapists he encounters, but because of the cop supervising him. For this is Denzel Washington's Alonzo Harris, a corrupt, amoral, bad, bad, cop who puts his young charge through a physical and emotional ringer. It's a sizzling performance that energises the whole movie - before he finally spirals way over the top. </p> <p><strong> The Officer's Ward </strong></p> <p> (Francois Dupeyron, 2001) 10.30pm, BBC4 </p> <p>Dupeyron's moving first- world-war drama is set mainly in a Parisian hospital, where French officer Eric Caravaca's Fournier lies horribly disfigured by an explosion - the film's half over before the camera shows us the extent of his injuries. But gradually, as his face is reconstructed, so too is his shattered sense of self, aided by staff and fellow patients: it may sound deeply depressing, but it's an uplifting film with surprising shafts of humour. </p> <p><strong> Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia</strong> </p> <p> (Sam Peckinpah, 1974) 11.55pm, Sky Cinema 1</p> <p> Peckinpah's bloody modern western has washed-up piano player Warren Oates taking on mobsters, bikers and bandits to deliver said flyblown head to the Mexican gangster offering a big reward: it belonged to the man who impregnated his daughter. It's all sweat, death and bloody retribution in this doom-laden meditation on the human condition, one of Peckinpah's finest.

  "<p>The Savoy hotel, the landmark London hotel overlooking the Thames, and its near-neighbour Simpson's-in-the-Strand, could be taken over by Prince al-Waleed bin Talal. </p> <p>The wealthy Saudi prince is thought to have lost out in the race to take control of the businesses four months ago when they were bought - along with the Berkeley, the Connaught, Claridges and the Savoy theatre - by a consortium led by a former Irish taxman Derek Quinlan. </p> <p>Quinlan Private, which makes investments on behalf of wealthy individuals, bought the Savoy Group for \u00a3750m. The name of the overall holding company is likely to have to change if the talks with the Saudi prince are successful. </p> <p>Prince al-Waleed bin Talal is thought to be prepared to pay just over \u00a3200m for the Savoy and Simpson's-in- the-Strand which, in turn, are expected to be run by Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts, a Toronto-based operation in which the Saudi prince is already involved. </p> <p>The prince is holding talks with Quinlan Private in conjunction with Bank of Scotland Corporate, part of HBOS. </p> <p>Mr Quinlan, chairman of the eponymous group, said: \"The Savoy Group has performed exceptionally well since our acquisition and has exceeded our expecta tions. However, the potential to sell the Savoy itself presents a logical opportunity to make an immediate return on our initial investment and allow us to focus on the development of the other hotels in the group\". </p> <p>Quinlan Private bought the hotels from venture capitalists Blackstone Group and Colony Capital. At the time, Quinlan Private said it would consider expanding the Savoy, which was designed to have more than the 263 rooms it had then.</p>",
  "<p>\"Blood will have blood,\" is the Hollywood-style slogan on the posters, and director Dominic Hill plays his most gory card first when John MacAulay's bleeding captain arrives on a stretcher from the battlefield. Nearly upstaged by his own wounds, the mutilated soldier is only one blow away from a bodybag. </p> <p>He could be a victim of Iraq, Beslan or Darfur, so effectively does this modern-dress production remind us of the brutal circumstances of Macbeth's ascent. Such carnage, Hill suggests, is a perilous foundation on which to build a new regime. </p> <p>By contrast, Paul Blair's Macbeth is as much politician as warrior. He strides on in his combat gear manfully enough, but there's something clean, almost cuddly about him, a restraint, a reflexiveness and a humanity that make him more than a mere killing machine. He is made formidable only in tandem with Irene Macdougall as a sort of First Lady Macbeth, a Hillary to his Bill, a Cherie to his Tony, a Mira to his Slobodan. </p> <p>Played over a stately two-and-a-half hours, this is a careful psychological examination of two people on an empire-building adventure over which they are never fully in control. In private, they show all the sexual passion, companionship and vulnerability of a credible marriage. In public, they put on the polished professional face of the modern political celebrity. </p> <p>When Macbeth sees Banquo's ghost, his wife is not so much alarmed as furious about how it will look. In a typically witty touch, she resolves the situation by leading her guests in a crockery-throwing session \"as a thing of custom\". </p> <p>The production is rich in such detail, from Fleance enjoying a sly teenage drink to Macbeth growling out his own fate when he meets the baglady witches. Expertly enhanced by Jeanine Davies's shadow-throwing lighting and Anthea Haddow's ominous soundscape, it's a staging that makes chilling contemporary sense of the play, without reducing it to a simplistic metaphor. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Until September 25.

  "<p>European Union finance ministers will this weekend be urged to clip the wings of national regulators with powers to block cross-border bank mergers in a move designed to foster pan-European groups that can compete with big US banks. </p> <p>Sir George Matthewson, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, Rijkman Groenink of ABN-Amro and Michel P\u00e9bereau of BNP-Paribas, will press the ministers, meeting in The Hague, to remove obstacles to \"foreign\" takeovers of national banks. </p> <p>The Dutch government, which holds the EU presidency, has drawn on the proposed takeover of Abbey National by Spain's Banco Santander to highlight the case for easing the way to mergers that could prevent US \"megabanks\" dominating the European market. </p> <p>Yesterday, in a background paper, the Dutch said banking mergers would boost competition and produce better, more diverse products but pointed out that, over the past 10 years, cross-border European banking deals accounted for only 2% of all deals compared with 37% in all sectors. Foreign banks own 51% of banking assets in Britain compared with 5% in Germany, 6% in Italy and 20% in France. </p> <p>Frits Bolkestein, internal market commissioner, wants the EU banking directive of 2000 revised so the \"prudential rules\" allowing national regulators to block mergers are defined more clearly and more narrowly. </p> <p>These rules, which embrace capital adequacy and internal control systems, also encompass judgments about the fitness and honesty of individuals to manage financial companies.</p>",
  "Should a country whose constitution prohibits it from using military force overseas be granted membership of a body that dispatches troops to war zones across the globe? <p>A question for an undergraduate international relations exam, perhaps, but also a very real political conundrum that Japan is eager to see answered in the affirmative.</p> <p>As the world's second-biggest economy and No 2 contributor to UN coffers after the US, it seems faintly ridiculous that Japan is not a permanent member of the UN security council alongside the US, Britain, France, Russia and China.</p> <p>Its quest to join them was strengthened this year when the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, sent hundreds of troops on a humanitarian mission to southern Iraq despite widespread opposition at home.</p> <p>That won him kudos in Washington and London, and took the sting out of accusations - made after the first Gulf War - that Tokyo is interested only in bankrolling conflicts while troops from elsewhere take the risks.</p> <p>But whether that will be enough to convince all five permanent members of the security council - the P5 - of Japan's suitability is open to question.</p> <p>It does not help that Mr Koizumi himself is a latter-day convert to the UNSC bid. Until recently, he stated publicly that Japan could not mount a serious bid for membership as long as it retained article 9 of its constitution, in which \"the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.\"</p> <p>Later this month, however, Mr Koizumi will plug his country's bid for permanent status in a speech to the UN general assembly. \"I want to express the view that there could be another permanent member of the UNSC of a different type - and that is Japan,\" he said this week.</p> <p>Article 9, like the rest of Japanese constitution, was authored by the Americans after the end of the second world war. Now they want to see it ditched, hinting that Japan's bid could fail if it isn't.</p> <p>Quite how far Washington expects Japan to go in acquiring the diplomatic - read military - mandate to match that of the current P5 is not clear.</p> <p>This week the Japanese government's top spokesman, Hiroyuki Hosoda, claimed Tokyo had been given assurances that \"the US is supporting Japan's membership of the UNSC without any prior conditions.\"</p> <p>Yet only days earlier, the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, had this to say: \"If Japan is going to play a full role on the world stage and become a fully active and participating member of the security council - and have the kind of obligations it would pick up as a member of the security council - article 9 would have to be examined in that light.\"</p> <p>Observers say Japan's best chance lies in allying its membership mission to the general push for UN reform, with an increase in the number of permanent UNSC members - perhaps by as many as five - as the centerpiece. Germany, Brazil, India and South Africa are among the other candidates.</p> <p>Unity won't necessarily bring results, however. Expanding UNSC membership would require the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-strong membership of the UN general assembly and every one of the P5.</p> <p>And the P5, of course, includes China. Beijing has so far held its tongue, but Chinese media have made no secret of their opposition to Japan's bid until it is satisfied that its former enemy has sufficiently atoned for its brutal occupation of parts of China before and during the war.</p> <p>While maintaining that constitutional revision is not a prerequisite for permanent membership, Mr Koizumi is also at the forefront of efforts to rewrite article 9 to allow Japan to play a greater role in, for example, UN-sponsored military operations.</p> <p>Supporters of article 9 have been using the build-up to his speech in New York on September 21st to remind him that ditching official pacifism is too high a price to pay for the prestige and power afforded by membership of the world's most exclusive diplomatic club.</p> <p>Mr Koizumi must also fend off accusations that a permanent seat at the UNSC table would make it easier for Washington to dictate Japanese foreign policy - a reasonable charge given Japan's eager participation in the \"coalition of the willing.\"</p> <p>Those accusations come not only from the pacifist left. Yohei Kono, a former Liberal Democratic party foreign minister and current speaker in the lower house, said, \"It is not appropriate to revise article 9 just because the United States urges us to.\"</p> <p>A panel set up by UN secretary general Kofi Annan to look into reform is due to report at the end of the year. Japan may be disappointed by what it has to say, particularly if, as many believe, it will recommend the creation of seven or eight semi-permanent seats - minus the power of veto - to be renewed every five years. Japan would probably accept such an offer, but only grudgingly and with assurances that something more substantial will be on offer down the line.</p> <p>From January, Japan will be given the opportunity to prove its worth as one of the 10 countries granted revolving, two-year membership of the UNSC.</p> <p>\"Japan must think about what it can do to contribute to peace and global security,\" Mr Koizumi said.</p> <p>And there is much it can do to prove to the doubters at home and abroad that permanent membership would amount to more than an automatic vote for the US.</p> <p>Cash aside, Japan has much else to offer - not least a new perspective as the only non-nuclear P5 country - but also in technology, education and humanitarian expertise.</p> <p>The push for a bigger say in resolving the world's messiest conflicts would be more palatable to many of Mr Koizumi's compatriots if it were based on Japan's abundant strengths, rather than what it is prepared - eventually - to abandon for the sake of greater prestige on the international stage.</p>",
  "The authenticity of Jemaah Islamiyah's claim of responsibility for Thursday's Jakarta bomb on an Islamic website cannot be confirmed. There are strong indications, however, that the militant network that wants to turn south-east Asia into an Islamic state was responsible for the explosion that killed nine people and injured some 180. <p>Australian and Indonesian police agree the bombers' modus operandi was extremely similar to that of the Bali bombings in 2002, which killed 202 people, and the bomb at Jakarta's JW Marriott hotel in August 2003, which killed 12. </p> <p>The chemicals found at the three bomb sites were also almost identical - mostly potassium chloride and TNT - and so were the tactics. A vehicle is packed with the rudimentary but effective device and parked immediately in front of the selected target before being detonated, usually with the driver still at the wheel. </p> <p>One of the loudest questions being heard in Indonesia is why the bombings are continuing. It is almost as if one bombing is a tragedy, two in 10 months is unfortunate but three in two years is bordering on the unacceptable. </p> <p>As the Media Indonesia daily said today in an editorial: \"We are ashamed because, as a nation, we are considered a crime nest. We are ashamed because the police are not able to prevent another bomb blast.\" </p> <p>The headline of the editorial in another newspaper, Kompas, was even simpler. \"Another bomb, another bomb, until when [?]\" But is Indonesia really crawling with terrorists? </p> <p>Not in the least, would be the initial reaction of someone who has observed Indonesia merely through the lens of its three election campaigns this year. </p> <p>None of the parties or presidential candidates has made anything more than a passing reference to the lingering problem and, in opinion polls, the terrorist threat has consistently not even made the top 10 of issues voters are most concerned about. </p> <p>That does not mean it no longer exists, as the Australian embassy bombing demonstrated all too clearly. So to outsiders it must appear almost as if the issue is like a nasty carpet stain for Indonesians. If they don't look at it and don't draw attention to it, they can convince themselves it does not exist. </p> <p>Indonesians are not stupid. Most know the problem is out there and the authorities, albeit often only under external pressure, are making progress in defeating JI. Dozens of alleged members have been arrested and 33 men have been convicted in connection with the Bali bombing. </p> <p>They could, however, be doing a great deal more. The government has only been half-hearted in its efforts to prosecute Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, the fiery cleric who is JI's alleged spiritual leader, and no real effort has been made to dismantle the militant Islamic boarding schools that are known to have turned out numerous radicals. </p> <p>The next obvious question is: why haven't they done more? Fear of upsetting Muslim sensibilities in the world's most populous Muslim nation is a large part of the answer. It is seen as almost political suicide to start waging open warfare against fellow Muslims, even though the militants' support base is tiny by any standards. </p> <p>The authorities have been getting away with their tentative efforts to date because the targets have been foreign: nightclubs packed with tourists, an American hotel and now the Australian embassy. There is a palpable atmosphere in some quarters of \"well, Indonesians are not being targeted so it's not really our problem\". </p> <p>It will be interesting to see whether this political hesitancy continues after the latest attack. Whoever is elected president on September 20 will have strong public support to come down hard on people clearly identified as terrorists. The million-dollar question is will he, or she, do so? </p> <p>Corruption and incompetence in the security forces and intelligence agencies are also key factors. It is easy for people to bribe the authorities to look the other way, and, even if they were focusing on the job, there is no guarantee they would have the capacity to act effectively. </p> <p>So how is this cycle of violence going to end? No one knows. A more dynamic president than Megawati Sukarnoputri would definitely be an asset, as would the adoption of a more holistic approach to defeating terrorism, involving education and provincial development as well as the strong arm of the law. </p> <p>And when might it end? Hard to tell but it would be extremely surprising if more bombs did not explode quite regularly over the next five years, particularly if the two alleged ringleaders, Azahari Husin and Noordin Mohammed Top, remain at large.</p>",
  "<p>Banco Santander Central Hispano yesterday began to sever its 15-year ties with Royal Bank of Scotland to clear the way for its proposed \u00a38.5bn takeover of Abbey National. </p> <p>The Spanish bank raised \u00a31.25bn by selling half of its 5% stake in RBS, a move interpreted as an attempt to amass a warchest should any counterbid for Abbey emerge. </p> <p>Santander also admitted for the first time that its two executives on the RBS board will leave if its bid for Abbey is successful. Similarly, Sir George Mathewson, the RBS chairman, will relinquish his seat on the Santander board should the Spanish bank's bid for Abbey succeed. </p> <p>Analysts said the cash raised through the sale of the 80m RBS shares could allow the Spanish bank to increase its offer to as much as 700p a share should HBOS - or any other rival - decide to bid. </p> <p>Yesterday, Santander's offer for Abbey, based on one of its own shares and 31p in cash, was worth 589p. Abbey's shares closed at 613p, while RBS's were down 30p at \u00a315.87. RBS shares have traded above \u00a317.50 in the last 12 months. </p> <p>\"This is a bit of sabre-rattling,\" said Nick Lord, banking analyst at Deutsche Bank. Norrie Morrison, banking analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton, said: \"Santander is showing HBOS it has deep pockets.\" </p> <p>Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, predicted it was now more likely the Santander offer would be raised. </p> <p>The announcement came a week before Europe's competition commissioner is due to rule on the Santander offer for Abbey and the day before the deadline for the Spanish bank to give any undertakings to the authorities to secure clearance. </p> <p>Santander said the tone of the announcement was \"reflected\" in its notification about the Abbey deal filed with the European commission on August 13. Emilio Botin, Santander's chairman, said that he realised - along with RBS - that the cross-directorships would be \"inappropriate\" if the Abbey deal was concluded. </p> <p>He said reducing the shareholding in RBS to 2.5% would \"enhance our capital flexibility\", although this appeared to contradict his comments in July when the Abbey deal was announced. </p> <p>Yesterday's Santander statement was intended to send a clear message to HBOS, which is yet to decide whether to mount a counteroffer for Abbey. </p> <p>HBOS had complained to the European authorities about the cross-holdings, cross-directorships and any potential IT link-ups between RBS and Santander should the Abbey deal go ahead. HBOS yesterday welcomed the announcement, saying it provided \"clarity\". </p> <p>The relationship between RBS and Santander was forged in 1988. Sir George was personally involved in cementing the alliance and has become a personal friend of Juan Inciarte, general manager of Santander. </p> <p>Mr Inciarte is the Santander executive who is leading the Abbey takeover negotiations and will have to give up his seat on the RBS board, along with Mr Botin, if his ambition to take over Abbey comes to fruition. </p> <p>The alliance with Santander was crucial for RBS after a major shareholder announced sale of its stake. It has proved a useful relationship. Santander helped RBS win control of NatWest in 2000, while RBS has supported Santander's acquisition sprees. </p> <p>Santander is expected to sell off the rest of its RBS shareholding after the 90-day lock-in period. RBS might hold on to its stake in Santander for a while longer, however.</p>",
  "Just as John Kerry's prospects for victory appear to be dimming, along comes an issue that could catapult him back into this race, if only he would seize on it. <p>The assault weapons ban - the landmark bill signed into law by Bill Clinton that took dangerous automatic weapons off US streets - is set to sunset next week. The Republican-led Congress is going to let it lapse and President Bush - who said he was in favour of the ban in 2000 - has kept silent, in deference to the National Rifle Association, whose endorsement he wants.</p> <p>This is a made-to-measure opportunity for Kerry to reassert himself around a popular wedge issue. The assault weapons ban is widely credited as one of the reasons violent crime rates took a dive in the 90s and is supported by two thirds of voters.</p> <p>Kerry should do three things at once. Firstly, he should lay down a clear challenge to Bush, who, while saying he supports the ban, has made it clear he will not lift a finger to persuade congress to reconsider. \"Join me in calling for an extension of the ban,\" he should declare, then jump on the President's vacillations, force him to clarify his position and conclude: \"Now who's the flip flopper?\"</p> <p>Secondly, he should appear at a press conference with James Brady - the secret service agent who took a bullet for Ronald Reagan and whose name adorns the \"Brady\" assault weapons bill. Also at Kerry's side should be police chiefs and sheriffs from around the nation who have already vigorously opposed the ban's expiration. Then Kerry should raise an AK47 aloft and say: \"This is an AK47, the same weapon terrorists used to storm that school in Russia. Republicans in Congress and President Bush want to put weapons like these back on our streets. We won't let them.\"</p> <p>Thirdly, Kerry should cut an ad that goes down US assault weapon memory lane. It could open with the Los Angeles bank robber shooting rampage in 1997, when criminals in body armour strafed away at policemen with handguns for over an hour on live TV. Although this took place after the assault weapons ban went into effect, the guns used came from a market that the ban has since effectively halted. The script should catalogue the numerous assault weapon murders before the ban took effect, including the time in 1989 when Patrick Edward Purdy opened up with an AK47 on a school yard in Stockton, California. He fired over a hundred rounds in under a minute, killing five children, before turning the gun on himself.</p> <p>Kerry has shown no signs of implementing any part of such a strategy. His campaign has hinted that they will turn to the issue on Monday - the very day the ban is set to die - leaving Kerry open to the charge that he's grandstanding. If he were to speak out today, or even over the weekend, he could be trying honestly to prevent the end of the ban, rather than commenting on something that already happened. But such is the habit of John Kerry. Cautious to a fault, he wants to wait until the very last minute, or beyond, before committing himself.</p> <p>To be fair to him, there is an issue as to how any gun law is viewed in states where the gun lobby is strongest, in other words, in most of the battleground states. The Kerry camp is no doubt focus grouping in Pennsylvania and Florida, to see how the issue is playing there. </p> <p>But the truth is most people are in favour of the ban wherever they live, if it is framed to them correctly. They need to know that the market place that deals in M16s, AK47s, Tech 9s and the like is gearing up with Lockean efficiency. Anticipating a surge in demand next week, gun stores already have stocks on back order. As supplies go up, so prices will inevitably come down and neighbourhoods will again become flooded with weapons rarely used by people without criminal intent.</p> <p>This isn't about taking the right to bear arms away from law-abiding citizens. This isn't about stopping the fun of the fish and game crowd. Kerry can show himself blasting away with his shotgun to reassure them.</p> <p>This is really about political courage, about showing leadership, about taking a risk because it is the right thing to do. Too often during this campaign, to coin a baseball metaphor, Kerry has let the pitch go by. But you can't knock the ball out of the park, unless you take a swing at it.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Philip James is a former senior Democratic party strategist</p>",

Cruising down the motorway out of international football in hissy outrage at Michael Hughes' tackle, Sav was singing along to Wham! for the benefit of the rearview mirror when he spotted a large sign saying \"to spite your face\". Putting that together with the \"Cutting your nose off\" sign five miles back, he yanked the handbrake up and clattered through the central reservation.</p> <p>Having spent the last 24 hours singing about disgraceful leg-breaking in time to Careless Whisper, the Haircut Time Forgot wasted no time in regaining control of his Renault 5, checking the mirror, selecting a new track, checking the mirror, and hoisting a loudspeaker onto the roof. \"I just love playing for Wales,\" he crooned, to the tune of Club Tropicana. \"The emotion of playing in front of 65,000 people at the Millennium Stadium is something I could never turn my back on,\" he added, ignoring the still smoking skid marks on the other side of the road and flashing his best winning smile.</p> <p>It hasn't had the desired effect on Northern Ireland manager Lawrie Sanchez though; he's looking distinctly like Granny Fiver attempting to eat a lemon with her teeth out. \"Robbie Savage is a drama queen who likes lots of attention,\" he huffed. \"He has built a reputation for going around the pitch and putting it about [Fiver titters shamelessly], yet as soon as he gets a bad tackle he moans about it. If you live by the sword, you die by the sword,\" he rounded off, working himself up into full Brian Blessed mode. Whether that - or the sound of Bad Boys striking up in the distance - sent Rob running has yet to be confirmed.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"How many teams in England play with more style than us?

  "They walk in slow procession across a field of summer flowers, through the scent of mint into the nightmare of their memories. They arrive this time as survivors, not prisoners. Or else they come to pay homage to dead relatives at this accursed place: the now disused iron ore mine at Omarska, in northwest Bosnia. In 1992 it was a concentration camp, the location of an orgy of killing, mutilation, beating and rape, prior to enforced deportation for those lucky enough to survive. The victims were Bosnian Muslims and some Croats, the perpetrators their Serbian neighbours. <p>They move, tentatively, on this day of commemoration among desolate, rust-coloured industrial buildings, haunted by what happened within them. Nusreta Sivac places a flower on each space of floor where her dead friends once slept in the quarters for women who \"served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, covered with blood\" - quarters just across a hallway from the now empty office where she was, like them, serially raped, night after night. And she passes the window from which she watched the slaughter of men on the asphalt below, day in, day out. </p> <p>Satko Mujagic knows that asphalt well: his two-year-old daughter now plays with a ball on the very spot where he had been too weak to line up for bread because of dysentery, and had to be supported by his father. Later, the child picks a daisy. \"You do this where your father lay bleeding,\" says one of the party. \"Being here gives me the feeling of understanding nothing,\" says Satko. \"The violence here was nothing to do with anything, not even war. It is unfathomable.\" </p> <p>Young Sehiba Jakupovic, her face contorted with grief, stares around the rooms in a building called the White House from which hardly anyone emerged alive; her husband Alem was among those who perished. \"I have a 12-year-old now,\" she says quietly, \"just a baby at the time.\" </p> <p>Nusreta tells the story of a family typical of Omarska and its legacy; one family among the thousands. \"It was the night of one of their saints, St Peter,\" she recalls. \"The guards were drunk and set tyres on fire, singing their songs and screaming as they took prisoners out to jump on them and beat them to death. One man, Becir Medunjanin, was being jumped upon, while his wife Sadeta watched from our quarters. She cried out, 'What are they doing to him?' and I tried to calm her lest she lost control and was taken out too. Sadeta was later killed as well. They had two sons; one had already been killed when they shelled the village - Sadeta always said that if she survived Omarska she would find his body to give it a proper burial. The other, Anes, survived Omarska, the only member of the family to live. He came with me just recently to identify Sadeta's body and gave his DNA. 'That is my mother,' he said.\" </p> <p>The date of this commemoration of the camp's closure - August 6 - is branded into these people's minds. And I have a stake in all this: for the closure of Omarska followed the day after the putrid afternoon of August 5, 1992, on which it had been my accursed honour to find a way into this place, along with a crew from ITN. </p> <p>We saw little that day, but enough: terrified men emerging from a hangar, in various states of decay - some skeletal, heads shaven - and drilled across a asphalt yard, under the watchful eye of a machine-gun post, into a canteen where they wolfed down watery bean stew like famished dogs, skin folded like parchment over their bones. \"I do not want to tell any lies,\" said one prisoner, \"but I cannot tell the truth.\" And it is strange - traumatic, indeed - to stand again in that now empty canteen; strange to walk that asphalt killing ground. </p> <p>It is disturbing to wander these dread buildings - where inmates were held and beaten, and whence they were called to their death: buildings forbidden to us that day in 1992, our paths blocked by armed guards and the camp commander, Zjelko Meakic, now awaiting trial in The Hague. Disturbing also to see the so-called Red House, where prisoners' throats were cut. </p> <p>The feeling is all the more strange when I recognise a man I had met that day, in that same canteen: Sefer Haskic, who is now a joiner in Bolton, revisits the room into which he was crammed. \"I was trying to remember the people they killed,\" he says. \"All my friends. They would call out the names, and men would get up, leave us, and never come back. You could hear the screaming, the killing, you could smell burning tyres and dead bodies. Next morning there would usually be about 30 of them: the yellow truck would arrive so that other prisoners could load them up and go to dig graves. The truck would always come back, but the men who loaded it usually not. I was forever waiting my turn, but it never came - I still can't believe I'm alive.\" Sefer remembers in particular a night of frenzied ferocity, during which some 150 men were killed, \"and the walls were covered with blood\". </p> <p>However, these people have not returned to Omarska only for remembrance; it is also a gesture of defiance. It was intended by the Bosnian Serbs - as has been affirmed at The Hague - that no Muslims (or rather Bosniaks - the secular ethnic term by which they are properly known) should remain on this territory alive; that they should all be deported or killed. But all around us now are the sights and sounds of a once unthinkable return by thousands of Bosniaks to the homes from which they were brutally expelled. They come back under the shadow and insignia of their persecutors, with whom they live cheek by jowl - for this is the so-called Republika Srpska granted to the Bosnian Serbs at Dayton in 1995. But they do so all the same. </p> <p>They return also to the village of Kozarac, the site of a savage attack on May 24, 1992. It was emptied of all 25,000 Bosniak inhabitants. Every Muslim house was marked in paint for incineration; the surviving Muslims herded in droves over the mountains at gunpoint. But the place is now home to more than 6,000 Bosniak \"returnees\", who outnumber the Serbs as they did before, with an additional 15,000 visiting from the scattered diaspora for summer. Once again, minarets - blown apart by the Serbs - nestle, rebuilt, against the hillside. </p> <p>With much greater difficulty, people return also to the local seat of authority, Prijedor, where the persecutions were planned and whence orders for establishment of the camps, for the killing and mass deportation were given. In Prijedor returnees live under the cold stare of their erstwhile persecutors, but Kozarac is an effervescent, if peculiar, place. As families sit out to enjoy pizza and beer in the warm evening, so they recognise one another: a survivor of Omarska here, of another camp there, a bereaved father here, a widowed mother there. The entire community is a concentration camp survivors' reunion. Everyone here is damaged, but resilient. No life is unaffected by the maelstrom of violence. </p> <p>If there is a driving force behind the return to Kozarac, it is the quietly composed figure of Sabahudin Garibovic, who runs the Concentration Camp Survivors' Association. \"We are doing this,\" he says, \"to show the Serbs who evicted us that they did not entirely succeed. That we can come back. They never thought they would see it. They cannot fathom what we are doing.\" </p> <p>Sabahudin's father survived Omarska, but his brother Armin was among the first to die there, his name called from among 156 men packed into the \"garage\", a space just five metres by six. There was no water: the men had to drink urine to live. It was so hot that the prisoners smashed an upper window to let in air, for which Armin and another man were murdered. Sabahudin himself is a survivor of Trnopolje, another camp we entered that day in 1992: \"I remember them taking out the girls to do what they would with them - six or so each night, including my niece.\" Trnopolje was the location for the enduring image of the war: the skeletal Fikret Alic and other prisoners behind barbed wire. </p> <p>\"Almost every day I see the people who did this to us,\" says Sabahudin. \"We live separate lives - there is nothing that unifies us with the Serbs. We rely on ourselves and each other to survive.\" </p> <p>Just before our meeting, a jubilant wedding motorcade passed through town, hooting and waving the old Bosnian wartime flag. In overwhelmingly Serbian Prijedor, it was pelted with bottles and rocks. Two weeks before, a bomb had been thrown at a Bosniak-owned bar in Kozarac; a Serbian former camp guard living near Omarska was beaten up by Bosniaks. There are countless such incidents. \"International foundations organise round tables to discuss living together,\" says Sabahudin, \"but it is empty talk, and the reasons are simple: we cannot forgive or forget what happened, and they either deny it happened or say they had to do it - they were obeying orders.\" </p> <p>Kozarac's economy depends almost entirely on the diaspora - on Omarska survivors such as Edin Kararic, who now works as a tanker driver based in Watford, near London. Edin has managed to put some money into buying a cafe called Mustang on Kozarac's main drag, managed for him by a fellow survivor. \"They drove us out,\" says Edin, \"and we are buying it back. This cafe is my finger stuck up to the Serbs who did not want us here. In fact, that is what those minarets are, on the mosques that no one goes to: fingers stuck up at the Serbs. That is why we must come back to this place - why else would any of us want to, given what happened here? </p> <p>\"Mind you,\" he adds, pensively, \"it's difficult to enjoy yourself in a place where 7,000 people are missing from a population of 25,000.\" </p> <p>Emsuda Mujagic was among the first to come back to Kozarac, having been a refugee in Croatia. \"I wanted to see in the new millennium at home,\" she says, \"and so I came back on December 31 1999. Our house was one of the first to be destroyed in the shelling, but we rebuilt it slowly. There was literally nothing here. No birds, just snakes and a few Chetniks [slang for Serbs]. I have to stand up to their plan, which was to destroy not just a community but a whole people. That is the wish that has kept me going.\" </p> <p>Emsuda is a survivor of Trnopolje, and on the 12th anniversary of our discovery of the camp, she takes me back to what is now a school again, closed for summer. There, sitting on the steps, Esmuda recalls how each night \"the guards would just walk by and shoot or beat people while we slept in the open. Or else they would come into the women's and children's quarters with torches and read the names of young girls from a list, some as young as 10, 12 or 13. They would take them to a house where Serbian soldiers from the front would have their way with them. Some of the girls would come back, scarred and tortured - others would not, and we understood they had been tortured to death. One woman was breastfeeding her baby when they took her - she gave the child for safekeeping and came back horribly scarred.\" </p> <p>Nusreta, who struggled to come to terms with her ordeal in Omarska, steeled herself to return to Prijedor in July 2002. By way of welcome, she found the word \"Omarska\" scrawled across her doorway by her new neighbours. \"At first I thought I wouldn't be able to bear it,\" she says. \"I used to stay indoors, peeping through the curtains.\" </p> <p>There was always a macabre intimacy to Bosnia's war - people knew their torturers and murderers - and the intimacy remains. \"A lot of the Omarska guards live in my neighbourhood,\" says Nusreta. \"I see them almost every day. One of them, called Vokic, has his entrance in the next block of flats and we share a bedroom wall. I see the interrogators and even the man who ordered that I be put in Omarska - he's a bank manager and drives a Mercedes. I try to catch his eye, but he turns away. Another has been let out from prison in The Hague - called Kvocka. Last time I looked him in the eye was when he was in the dock and I was a witness. But I often see him on the street, even on the day we went to buy flowers for the burials of five women from Omarska whose bodies had been exhumed. There he was, in the florist buying flowers for his wife. I said to my friend: 'Look, Kvocka is standing behind you. On the day the dead are buried, and thousands more are dead, he walks free.'\" </p> <p>Nusreta, a former judge, returned not to her own apartment but to her brother's. Why? When she emerged alive from Omarska, she explains, she found a former typist from the bench called Ankica living in her flat, and was invited in for coffee. \"There I was, like someone gone mad,\" recalls Nusreta, \"straight from Omarska and a guest in my own flat. I sat down on my sofa. Ankica, wearing my clothes, made me coffee in my pot, served in the china my mother left me, and asked me: 'Why are you acting so strange?' She said the apartment suited her, she had always wanted one like this.\" </p> <p>Years later, Nusreta returned - as was her right under the Dayton peace plan - to be promised by Ankica that everything would be left in order. \"But when I finally evicted her,\" says Nusreta, \"it had all gone. Even the built-in wardrobe. Everything I had inherited from my mother. Even my photographs. It was pure spite, to wipe out my past.\" Thankfully, Nusreta has a few good friends in Prijedor, notably the only Bosniak doctor in town, Azra, whose elderly father and stepmother had their throats cut when after surviving Omarska in 1992. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I get a crisis in the night,\" says Nusreta, \"that someone may knock at the door or throw a brick through my window. But I will become happier in accordance with how many of our people come back. My only wish is that, by us coming home, the Serbs do not get what they wanted.\" However, she says by way of conclusion, \"I can never again be happy.\" </p> <p>One hallmark of the aftermath of Bosnia's war is an almost complete lack of reckoning on the part of the Bosnian Serbs. Only one defendant - the former Bosnian Serb joint-president herself, Biljana Plavsic - has pleaded guilty at The Hague to what happened, and appealed for reconciliation. But around Omarska the returnees' narrative falls down a black hole in the perpetrators' memory. \"There was no camp here,\" security guards at the entrance to Omarska mine told us. \"It was all lies, Muslim lies, and forgery by the journalists.\" </p> <p>\"There is no remorse,\" says Nusreta. \"No one has apologised or even admitted what happened. They say they know nothing about the camps. There are 145 mass graves and hundreds of individual graves in this region, and we invite the local authorities to our commemorations, but they never come.\" \"Even now,\" says the Bosniak political leader in Prijedor, Muharem Murselovic, \"the Serbs will not accept that anything happened. I am always in a dilemma - are they crazy, or are they pretending to be crazy? I think it is because they were all so deeply involved in what was happening that they cannot come forward and admit it.\" </p> <p>\"Every time I see a Serb who is extremist,\" says Sabahudin, \"I remind him of what happened in front of their eyes. In such a way as I hope might change his viewpoint. He has to understand that, if this country is to survive, they have to change their mind. Any future together is conditional upon them admitting what they did, and apologising for it.\" </p> <p>The security guards from the all-Serbian village of Omarska signal that it is time for the commemorative procession to leave the camp. But as we leave, there remains one urgent question, one burning uncertainty. </p> <p>Crucial to the reckoning of which Sabahudin speaks is the future of the site of camp Omarska. There is nothing to mark what happened here - the horrors are officially buried, hidden, denied. The Serbian local authorities are enthusiastically pursuing a plan to sell off the mine to overseas investors, which could result in the concealment of a mass grave, a monument to barbarity. The killing ground could become a car park. The physical memory of this evil but sacred ground could be obliterated. </p> <p>Bosniak expectations are modest, and quite possibly doomed. \"We would be pleased,\" says Sabahudin, \"if there could just be some kind of memorial, maybe that the White House might be fenced off. We just want something to ensure that the memory is preserved, and in the smallest way to awaken the conscience of the Serbs. That is the really important thing. Because if we don't awaken that conscience, we might as well forget everything. And that would be the saddest thing of all - to forget what happened and what could happen again tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow.\"</p>",
  "<p>Josh Hartnett is not one of these my-America-right-or-wrong patriots. He turns up for a day of press interviews in an anti-Bush T-shirt, but he won't brook any suggestion of European cultural superiority. </p> <p>The Pearl Harbor star is in London to promote Wicker Park, a frankly execrable remake of the 1996 French film L'Appartement. The original was a Hitchcockian drama about obsessive love, featuring a cast of deliciously amoral characters who would unashamedly betray their nearest and dearest for a girl or boy they'd met the night before. Wicker Park moves the action to Chicago, retains the visual opulence, but dumps the moral ambiguity. There are good guys, and there are bad guys. The bad guys get their comeuppance, and the good guys get together.</p> <p>But, says Hartnett, this isn't an American thing. \"That whole idea of American film being different from European film is nonsense,\" he says. \"It all depends on what kind of American film you're looking at. There's a giant stretch of American films being made. </p> <p>\"Plus there are different types of French movies. You know, people would say that Luc Besson's movies are American ... so you go, 'Well, he's French'. Or that Wicker Park is an American film, but [the director] Paul McGuigan's Scottish, so ... where are we talking about here? Is it all about where the money comes from , 'cos the money for this one comes from Europe. It can't be that. Is it the star? Then where do you put Russell Crowe? For me film is film and it doesn't have to do with borders or any of that sort of thing.\"</p> <p>Hartnett has a funny way with these soundbites. Sometimes he answers questions with the kind of combative forthrightness that more seasoned hands avoid in favour of bland diplomacy, but at other times he comes out with lines like \"film doesn't have to do with borders\" almost in spite of himself. At one point he declares \"there's a thin line between love and obsession\", then looks unbearably world weary, and adds with a defeated air, \"and I've said that so many times recently ...\"</p> <p>Returning to Wicker Park, he says he saw the film as a straight remake of L'Appartement, but can't control what happens to the film in the cutting room. \"I guess I see your point [about differences between the two versions], but that could be in the edit. The film itself was basically a translation of the other film, in the script at least, and then there were changes made afterward.\"</p> <p> This is a favourite theme of Hartnett's; the things directors can do to a performance once the actors have gone. Good actors, he says, generally only do one or two takes, because directors are confident they have the footage they need. Bad actors have to give lots of takes, and the upshot is that the director selects the best of many, and makes the bad actor's performance look better than the other actor's.</p> <p>He speaks with a slow gravelly drawl which is hard not to suppose is affected, and is comfortingly unfriendly in an oddly British way. He may not be the sharpest tool in the box, but he's not going to suffer fools. At least, that's to me, but then I'm asking him rude questions, and I'm a man. Watch him talking to female journalists about trivia, and you see a different Josh; his small, dark eyes widen and he leans right forward with a warm smile. The old charmer.</p> <p>That British reserve, and a slight unwillingness to play the game, has seen the 26-year-old actor abandon Hollywood for a home in his native Minnesota. He's dismissive of Los Angeles, which he describes as \"the business\", but he's also fairly dismissive of the recent trend for Hollywood actors to appear on the London stage - perhaps again there's an underlying wish to counter any suggestion that the old world is more cultured than the new.</p> <p>\"People are coming over here to do theatre for a lot reasons. Firstly, it's more forgiving over here than it is in New York; you do a play here, everybody automatically gives you props, no matter what. It's like 'Oh he's doing a piece of theatre on the West End, he must be a really committed actor' and you could be doing, like ...\" For a moment he seems about to name a show he particularly detests. Then he thinks better of it. \"I don't wanna bust anybody out. But in America if you do a piece of theatre, the critics will be all over it.\"</p> <p>It isn't that he dislikes London, or even has an aversion to the stage. \"I like that people are paying attention to theatre .... I think it's a good thing. But I won't do it just because it's a fad. I get really pissed off about fads. Any fads. I hate fads. They piss me off.\"</p> <p>Hartnett is heartwarmingly confident of his own abilities, to an extent that many might think his performances don't always support. After roles in such blockbuster fare as Black Hawk Down and 40 Days and 40 Nights, he now seems to be pitching himself as an arthouse character actor - his next role is as a man with Asperger's. </p> <p>\"I'm trying to choose scripts by character. I'm not so worried about creating a career. I want to create good roles, because ...\" he pauses, perhaps daring one to contradict, \"I'm a pretty good actor.\"</p>",
  "<p>The charities watchdog has today backed down from its stand-off with Home Office ministers over the charitable status of private schools, following talks between the two sides.</p> <p>The Charity Commission has been at loggerheads with ministers over measures in the draft charities bill to force charities charging high fees - including private schools - to prove they offer a public benefit in order to keep their charitable status and tax breaks.</p> <p>The charities minister, Fiona Mactaggart, had pledged that the public benefit checks would be applied to private schools. But the commission - which would carry out the checks - submitted evidence to the parliamentary committee scrutinising the draft bill saying the new legislation would \"probably not change\" the schools' charitable status because it would not override case law.</p> <p>The commission's stance threatened to stymie the proposed legislation, because it is an independent body, free to follow its own interpretation, making the public benefit test a dead letter. </p> <p>The row burst into the open at sessions of the joint committee of MPs and lords, which is chaired by Alan Milburn, who this week returned to the cabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.</p> <p>After the committee had grilled the Charity Commission's chair, Geraldine Peacock, and Ms Mactaggart in separate sessions, Mr Milburn slammed the situation as \"a dog's breakfast\".</p> <p>Ms Mactaggart told him that by the time the committee reported back to parliament - on or before September 30 - \"you might find that the Charity Commission has come to a common view\". Mr Milburn joked: \"Arms are being twisted up backs as we speak.\"</p> <p>In a joint letter to Mr Milburn, published today, Ms Mactaggart and Ms Peacock say they have found a way forward in a \"constructive spirit\".</p> <p>The letter says both sides agree that where charities charge high fees, organisations that \"wholly excluded poor people from any benefits, direct or indirect\" would not operate for the public benefit and would not be a charity. </p> <p>It explicitly states that the cases cited by the commission in its original written evidence \"will not prevent the commission from carrying out public benefit tests on schools\" - a clear change of position for the watchdog.</p> <p>Ms Peacock denied that the commission had been forced to retreat, saying: \"I don't think we've backed down. I think we've found a third way. We've found a way forward that addresses everybody's concerns.\"</p> <p>She confirmed that the public benefit checks would now be applied to private schools. \"What had been submitted [by the commission] at the committee was that the case law exists which appeared to be an impediment. But having looked at it further now and taken further legal advice in conjunction with the home office, we believe we can apply it,\" she said.</p> <p>Asked if this meant that a school which failed to provide a public benefit could be stripped of its charitable status, Ms Peacock replied: \"Yes, I think that potential has to be there.\"</p> <p>The commission is set to publish an annexe to the letter next week, setting out how it intends to begin the public benefit checks. Ms Peacock also said the commission would welcome the parliamentary committee's thoughts on bolstering the draft bill with guidance on what constitutes public benefit, which would make the new charity regime \"stronger\".</p>",

  "One of the most significant moves yesterday involved Ruth Kelly, now Alan Milburn's deputy but remembered by Guardian readers as the paper's young economics writer between 1990 and 1994. <p>It has been a mercurial path to the top. She got the Labour nomination for the Bolton West seat in 1997 and won it. </p> <p>Ministerial office in the Treasury beckoned for a woman who could do the sums. She impressed the hard-to-impress chancellor, Gordon Brown, (\"He thinks she's the only good economist there, apart from him\"), while giving birth to four children since 1997. Her husband, Derek, carries much of the domestic strain. </p> <p>The question MPs were asking was \"Is she a Brownite?\" The answer appears to be no. She is pragmatic and technocratic in temperament, an Irish Catholic by background, instinctively moderate. \"Definitely New Labour\", one Old Labour leftwing MP said. </p> <p>Her move to work with Mr Milburn on policy is a loss which Mr Brown does not deny, though it is another promotion for Ms Kelly, now 36. </p> <p>By contrast Kim Howells, now the higher education minister, is a nimble-footed survivor. As a former culture minister and a student at Hornsey college of art in the heyday of the 1960s rebellion, he has a passing knowledge of student culture. </p> <p>He can hold down a conversation about the violence in some rap music, dismissing the So Solid Crew as idiots glorifying the gun culture. He described the Turner prize as cold mechanical conceptual bullshit. </p> <p>He did not court popularity in his previous job as transport minister, and admits that he is amazed each time he is a given another government job. He called some rail managers rubbish, adding that a seven year-old could do a better job at compiling statistics. </p> <p>Mr Howells is not likely to be a shrinking violet. He will have to debate with higher education institutions, but he will also be expected to turn tuition fees into a political dogfight. He is a stranger to blandness, and that may be an admirable quality in his new job. The overwhelming anti-tuition fee consensus on campus is hardly likely to be challenged by being polite.</p>",
  "The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, today agreed to form a parliamentary investigative commission into the Beslan tragedy. <p>The move was seen as a response to the wide public dismay over last week's school hostage-taking in the North Ossetian town that left more than 350 people dead, many of them children.</p> <p>Mr Putin had reportedly said earlier that no public inquiry would be held but that an internal investigation would be conducted into the crisis that ended in a chaos of gunfire and explosions. </p> <p>But the federation council, Russia's upper house of parliament, will now form an investigative commission. </p> <p>The council largely follows Mr Putin's lead but its Beslan commission could constitute a relatively independent and public review of the crisis. </p> <p>The seizure of the school in Beslan and its bloody conclusion has raised serious questions about the capabilities of Russian law enforcement and security agencies. </p> <p>In a meeting shown on Russian television, Sergei Mironov, the chairman of the federation council, told Mr Putin the chamber aimed to form the investigative commission. </p> <p>Mr Putin agreed saying \"we are thoroughly interested in receiving a complete, objective picture of the tragic events connected with the seizure of the hostages\".</p> <p>North Ossetia's parliament meanwhile approved a new prime minister to head the government that was dismissed earlier in the week in the wake of angry demonstrations over the authorities' failure to prevent the attack. </p> <p>Alan Boradzov, the republic's former transportation minister, was nominated by the regional president, Alexander Dzasokhov, who dismissed the regional government but did not step down himself. </p> <p>Security officials yesterday identified six of the roughly 30 militants who seized the school as being from Chechnya, drawing a strong connection to the Chechen insurgents who have been fighting Russian forces for years. </p> <p>None of those identified so far have been Arabs despite the government's claim last week that Arabs were involved.</p> <p>At the Kremlin yesterday, the interior minister, Rashid Nurgaliyev, told Mr Putin that directors had been appointed for anti-terrorist commissions in republics across the region, including Chechnya. </p> <p>Few details were given about how the commissions would work, but the announcement showed the Kremlin's concern that inefficiency and corruption had undermined security and that violence could spread in the north Caucasus. </p> <p>Each commission would be headed by a senior interior ministry officer with the regional political leader as his deputy in many cases and a special task force of 70 men, Mr Nurgaliyev said. </p> <p>He said the commissions would coordinate police, security and military forces in an effort to prevent terrorist attacks.</p>",
  "<p>The Conservative party's proposals to boost university income by charging students higher rates of interest on their loans are \"ingenious\", but would hit the poorest students, a respected thinktank said today.</p> <p>The Higher Education Policy Institute concludes that the party's policy could halt the expansion of student numbers, barring up to 100,000 young people who will have the A-level qualifications necessary for university. </p> <p>The institute welcomes the \"undoubted progress\" in Tory thinking on higher education, but casts doubt on the claim by the shadow education minister, Tim Collins, that the proposals would set universities free from government control by making over the student loan debt to them. </p> <p>Student loan repayments - at a real rate of interest - would provide universities with a steady stream of funding for capital spending, which the Conservatives estimate will be worth \u00a33bn over the course of the next parliament. Day-to-day funding would be provided through \"national scholarships\" - cutting out the funding council Hefce, and others, which, at present, distribute the money and control student numbers at every university and higher education college. </p> <p>\"The proposal to transfer the loan book to universities is an ingenious way of guaranteeing a steady stream of income to universities to meet their capital needs,\" says Bahram Bekhradnia, the institute's director. </p> <p>He adds: \"Despite what is claimed, the policy is in many respects a centralising one. On the one hand the effective abolition of Hefce, and funding universities entirely through a student-based capitation fee, would reduce the level of interference and top-slicing by the centre. On the other hand, more functions would be taken into central government (deciding funding rates for different subjects, for example, and the identification of priority subjects). And there is a clear and explicit statement that the government will set the amount of funding that universities will receive through the national scholarships: there will be no discretion available to universities, as there will be under variable fees.\"</p> <p>Hepi backs the plan to remove the interest rate subsidy on student loans, which it argues is an indiscriminate subsidy to rich and poor. But the institute concludes that by continuing to reject tuition fees the Conservatives will benefit richer students at the expense of the poor. Rich students will need to borrow less and so pay less back in interest, while poor students will take longer to repay and end up subsidising higher education. Those who take the longest to repay - women taking career breaks and graduates in low paid professions - will pay the most under Mr Collins' proposals.</p> <p>Ironically, the Tory plan would also subsidise European Union students to the tune of about \u00a3150m a year by abolishing tuition fees - a fact perhaps overlooked by the eurosceptic wing of the party. </p> <p>Mr Bekhradnia concludes: \"Despite the undoubted progress in Conservative thinking in many respects, therefore, and some quite innovatory aspects of their proposals, in this crucial respect this looks like a short-term solution to a long-term issue. If in the future the government were to decide it cannot afford to fund universities properly from taxation it could not keep putting up interest rates in order to increase the value of the loan book. Although politically difficult, it would be able to allow universities to put up fees.\"</p>",
  "<p>If there's one quality that demonstrates a true winner, it's consistency. To win a consumer finance award once is an achievement. To win it three times in a row suggests that a company has not just got things right recently - but has, quite simply, got things right.</p> <p>The award for best credit card for 2004 goes to Smile, the company that won the award in 2003 and 2002 in a notoriously disloyal marketplace where some borrowers are prepared to switch plastic cards on monthly basis as they search out the best deal. </p> <p>Yet what Smile doesn't do is offer the lowest interest rate. The interest rate charged is 11.8%, which falls to 9.9% for Smile current account holders. On top of the low rate, however, Smile offers 0.5% cash back on all purchases. The card is available in standard or gold versions and offers up to 46 days' free credit.</p> <p>Smile is an internet bank owned by Co-operative Financial Services and set up in 1999 as an alternative to traditional branch-based banking. It proudly points out that it was the first internet bank to be awarded the British Standard kite mark for internet security.</p> <p>Security remains a key issue for customers, but Smile has focused just as much attention on service. For example, it offers a 24-hour telephone service centre that customers can use, for any reason, if they are unable to access the internet. </p> <p>Mervyn Pedelty, chief executive of Co-operative Financial Services believes that it's this kind of service standard that has made Smile a triple winner in these awards. \"We appreciate that credit card customers are looking for competitive products but we also understand that it is the Smile service ethos that has won us this award,\" Mr Pedelty says. \"I think we offer a compelling proposition. We have a great set of products, services and rates; our credit card is secure; switching is made easy; and it is from a bank with a clear ethical stance.\"</p> <p>Satisfaction with the Smile credit card was markedly higher than its nearest rivals in the consumer finance awards and, according to the company's own research, 94% of its customers would recommend Smile to their friends. The Co-operative's ethical stance - the organisation considers its investment decisions according to a range of ethical criteria and encourages the companies in which it invests to make improvements to their social and environmental conduct - may also be a significant factor in customer satisfaction.</p> <p>Security and convenience</p> <p>Gary Crompton, a chartered surveyor from Manchester, has been a Smile customer for almost five years since taking out a current account with the online bank. When he was looking for a credit card more recently, Smile seemed the obvious choice. </p> <p>\"The internet side of it is a big attraction to me,\" he admits. \"I can juggle my finances around on the computer which really helps if you're not overly organised and never seem to have time to go to the bank.</p> <p>\"The Smile site is easy to use and seems pretty secure, which is a big issue for me. And when I've needed to speak to Smile, they've always given me a straight and uncomplicated answer.\"</p> <p>A year in credit cards</p> <p>\u00b7 In August, the number of personal bankruptcies climbed to a record high as borrowers struggled with growing credit card debts. By March, credit card debts in the UK had reached \u00a311.9billion. \u00b7 The Office of Fair Trading has been investigating high charges. After a Treasury select committee accused credit card firms of imposing excessive charges late last year, the OFT has written to eight card firms about their late-payment fees. \u00b7 The battle against fraud continues. The banking industry is funding a \u00a33million a year anti-fraud police unit, set up to target organised gangs responsible for the majority of card crime. Plastic card fraud in the UK amounted to \u00a365million in 2003. \u00b7 Credit card\\spending on the internet has continued to rocket. One in 10 credit card transactions took place online in the second half of 2003, compared to one in 50 in 1999, according to the Association of Payments Clearing Services. \u00b7 By the end of 2004, plastic cards are expected to have overtaken cash as Britain's most popular form of payment. There are now 246 plastic card transactions made in the UK every second.</p> <p>Credit card tips</p> <p>\u00b7 If you don't clear your credit card debt in full every month then the right card for you is likely to be the one with the lowest charges. \u00b7 If you do clear your balance each month the interest rate is irrelevant. Look instead for rewards, such as cashback, for using the card. The interest-free period is also relevant; some cards offer up to 56 days before payment is due. \u00b7 If you have run up a large balance on your credit card it's worthwhile transferring to a lower rate, particularly to one of the many 0% interest rate deals on offer for transferred balances. However, if you have a large balance, check that the new card issuer will acccept it. \u00b7 If you are using a store credit card or planning to apply for one, don't. They tend to be much more expensive than standard mainstream cards. \u00b7 Using credit cards on holiday can be very convenient, but check what extra fees your card issuer may lumber you with. Some charge up to 3% for foreign currency transaction.</p>",
  "They came to Red Square in their tens of thousands \"in spite of it being a working day\", in the words of state-controlled television's reporter. \"Because it was a working day\" would have been more accurate. In institutes, government offices and colleges across the city the word had gone out from department heads and trade union secretaries to join the anti-terrorist march on Tuesday. <p>Shock, anger and grief over Beslan are universal among Russians, so it would be nonsense to suggest the protesters did not share the sentiments of Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of the main organisers. But many Muscovites said they chose not to go because it was an official rally. They feared manipulation. </p> <p>In Soviet times attendance at May Day and Revolution anniversary parades was close to compulsory. While today's pressures are softer, this week's state-sponsored demonstration was the latest intriguing piece in the puzzle of Vladimir Putin's Russia - how far does the president want to go in restoring central control after the laxness of the early post-communist Yeltsin years? </p> <p>In the United States the war on terror has produced a tightening of civil liberties and an upsurge in patriotic solidarity, which the Bush administration ruthlessly exploits. In central Asia and elsewhere, authoritarian governments have used it to stamp on dissidents. In Russia the mixture is different. </p> <p>No country has been dealt such a massive terrorist blow as the United States on September 11. It has not been repeated there, even on a small scale, and the degree of continuing anxiety about terror strikes most visitors to America as unwarranted. </p> <p>Russians, by contrast, have suffered at least a dozen major terrorist incidents in the last five years, far outstripping the death toll of the IRA campaign of bombings in British cities in the 1980s and 1990s. Although the phenomenon is new, Russians already seem resigned to it as one more scourge in the long catalogue of ills they have had to endure. It reinforces the feeling that ordinary citizens are helpless and that government can, at best, do little to defend them, and at worst will ignore their worries or even make life worse. </p> <p>In the emotional aftermath of the Beslan atrocity, few want talks with Chechen guerrilla leaders or any change in Putin's policy in the Caucasus. The state media will have little difficulty in continuing to push the line that the conflict is not primarily about Chechen independence - the terrorists' aim is to destabilise all the predominantly Muslim republics and undermine Russia's continued existence as a major state. It comes from Islamic fundamentalism as well as foreign governments who seek to exploit it in order to weaken Russia, as Putin put it in his recent late-night discussion with western academics and journalists, who were brought to Moscow on an expenses-paid trip by the state-run agency, RIA-Novosti. </p> <p>The more intriguing issue is how Beslan will be exploited to advance other Kremlin goals. Putin has been trying to restore the \"vertical\" lines of authority in Russia for some time. He has taken control of the national TV channels. He has pushed the regional governors out of parliament's upper house. He has started to strengthen the federal security service, the FSB. </p> <p>Now there are reports that he plans to revamp the electoral system. Currently, half the Duma's seats are decided in constituencies where independents can run. The Kremlin is said to want to end this and have every MP elected on a party list. Although the idea is spun as a device to give Russia a strong multi-party system at last, it will lead to more centralisation and raise the bar to independent opposition, according to Vladimir Ryzhkov, a prominent constituency MP from Siberia. </p> <p>\"They are going for the American model of Democrats and Republicans, which will be disastrous,\" he says. He sees it as a device for blocking resistance to the next stage in Putin's economic reforms. Politically authoritarian, Putin is a western-style neoliberal when it comes to the economy. </p> <p>Large though Tuesday's anti-terror rally was, at least as many people took part in this summer's marches and protests in Moscow and many other cities against Putin's shift in welfare benefits. Instead of getting free transport and medicine, people on benefits - from pensioners and war veterans to those living in the Arctic - will be given cash. Thousands fear it will not keep up with inflation. \"Around 20 members of Putin's own party, United Russia, joined us in voting against it but they were ones elected from the constituencies. That's one reason for his plan to move entirely to party lists,\" says Ryzhkov. </p> <p>Western governments and commentators have raised a lot of noise about the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, boss of oil giant Yukos. His trial is meant in part as a warning to the oligarchs not to fund opposition parties. It has created uncertainty for foreign investors and led to a new surge in capital flight. But its legitimate aim was to clamp down on tax evasion - a move which has been reinforced by Putin's recent appointment of members of the Kremlin administration to the boards of the few remaining state-owned enterprises. Even these firms were seen as becoming too independent and tax-avoiding, and Putin wants his own eyes and ears inside them. </p> <p>While these tax-collecting measures are a step forward, there is a major question over where the extra revenues will go. For ordinary Russians, the widening gap between rich and poor, the erosion of age-old social benefits and the galloping rise in utility bills - much less mentioned in the west - are more relevant than who owns Yukos. </p> <p>Behind it all lies the issue of the world price of oil, which has given Russia high nominal growth. What happens if it drops? At the RIA-Novisti conference, Mikhail Zadornov, a former finance minister, claimed it would have little impact on growth even if the price fell by half. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the panic reaction which Igor Ivanov, then foreign minister, had when Bush invaded Iraq last year. \"We're finished. The Americans will win in five days. Oil prices will sink and we'll be screwed,\" he is said to have told colleagues. His prediction on the oil price was wrong, but his view that Russia's fortunes still depend excessively on energy exports is surely right. </p> <p>Were the economy to crash, this summer's protest marches could be repeated tenfold. Even amid Moscow's showy affluence there is great poverty and hopelessness. In smaller towns across the country the layer of prosperity is far thinner. Trying to unify the country against a common terrorist threat could be one way of diverting attention from deeper and more pervasive social ills. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>This may not be the most subtle form of political theatre. But Embedded, written and directed by Tim Robbins and performed by The Actors' Gang from Los Angeles, is a lively addition to the body of protest drama about the Iraq war: closer in spirit to The Madness of George Dubya than to the Tricycle's sober verbatim theatre. </p> <p>There are three strands to Robbins's satirical collage. The most potent concerns the US military's attempt to control information from the embedded mainstream media. Then there are the political debates amongst the masked neo-cons in Bush's war cabinet. </p> <p>And, finally, there is the testimony of soldiers who express bewildered dismay and even, as in the famous case of the captive female rescued from an Iraqi hospital, find their experience grotesquely fictionalised. </p> <p>Robbins's weakness is that, in 85 minutes, he takes on too much and embraces too many diverse styles: everything from the techniques of Piscator's 1920s political revues to the homely realism of soldiers' letters. He sometimes takes too much on trust. </p> <p>The ideologically pure neo-cons prostrate themselves before the iconic figure of the German refugee philosopher, Leo Strauss. But I learned more about Strauss, who endorsed Plato's \"noble lies\", from the New York Review of Books than from the show. </p> <p>But to those who argue the show is leftwing propaganda, I would suggest that is nothing compared to the propaganda of the American military machine. </p> <p>Robbins is at his best in showing the journalists being drilled by a showbiz-addicted sergeant and in reminding us of the limitations placed on truth: on-the-spot reporters have to seek \"script approval\" back home, access to casualties is denied, events like the toppling of Saddam's statue are choreographed. His key point is that American viewers and readers have been fed a sanitised vision of the war. </p> <p>It also seems pointless to insist that all political theatre must be identical: there is room for wild satire as well as drama-doc. </p> <p>And when Robbins shows the cartoonish neo-cons offering contradictory justifications for war and gleefully asking \"Where do we go next?\" he is offering justified elaborations of known truths. </p> <p>Back home his buoyant show was critically panned and publicly popular; and the reason, I suspect, is that it offers a disenchanted view that doesn't get much airing in the predominantly pliant media. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until October 23.

  "<p>The revised draft mental health bill, unveiled earlier this week, poses the threat of significantly increasing the number of people subject to forcible treatment and detention. </p> <p>Under the government's proposals, psychiatrists would be able to forcibly detain someone with a serious personality disorder as long as they can provide them with \"clinically appropriate\" care. This significantly lowers the current threshold where people can only be detained if doctors think that treatment can improve their condition.</p> <p>The chief concern of the Mental Health Alliance, which brings together 60 groups representing professionals, carers and service users, is what the government means by the term 'clinically appropriate'. </p> <p>The problem begins with the new definition of mental disorder in the draft bill. If this bill were to become law, many more people could be found to have \"an impairment of or disturbance in the functioning of their mind or brain\" than have a psychopathic disorder under the current law. </p> <p>Under the current Mental Health Act, treatment must alleviate or prevent a deterioration in the patient's condition. Under the new draft bill, treatment must be appropriate given the patient's condition and also \" all other circumstances of [their] case\". This broad phrase would undoubtedly give the clinician the authority to take into account public protection issues in formulating a care and treatment plan. </p> <p>If a patient is at a substantial risk of causing serious harm to others, the bill also requires the clinician to take this into account in deciding whether a person should subject to compulsion. This appears to be a legal constraint on the clinician, even if the dangerous conduct was not related to the mental disorder. For example, a person's record of dangerous driving may not be related to their mental health condition but rather to their age. </p> <p>While the concept of treatment is as broad in the 1983 Act as in this bill (covering care and nursing for instance), in this new context it authorises, indeed compels, the clinician to find some form of treatment, no matter how minimal, in order to keep patients under compulsion. </p> <p>This could mean someone is subject to compulsion merely to ensure they attend an anger management course once a month. This will place a huge pressure on clinicians, and suggests the far broader use of compulsory powers than is permissible under current law.</p> <p>Many psychiatrists do not understand what the government aims to achieve by dropping the treatability test from mental health law. If clinically appropriate care is equivalent to that which provides therapeutic benefit to the patient, then we would be happy. But ministers need to confirm this - and make clear that the government has now dropped its proposal of using mental health services to indefinitely detain people with untreatable personality disorders.</p> <p>If this is not their intention then, given the broad definition of mental disorder in the draft bill, it seems that the Department of Health intends to give psychiatrists the authority to section anyone. </p> <p>If psychiatrists choose not to make use of this extended power it seems likely that they will be held accountable if an untreatable person harms themselves or someone else. However, if they do decide to use the new power and the person successfully appeals, arguing their civil liberties have been infringed, the psychiatrist will be held responsible. And if a psychiatric ward is overcrowded or violent because dangerous people are admitted, the doctors will again take the blame. So clarification of the bill's aim is urgently required.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Rowena Daw is the policy chairwoman of the Mental Health Alliance; Tony Zigmond is a consultant psychiatrist and vice-president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists</p>",

This is because the world around the famed comix lifer has always seemed on the verge of annihilation - as he confesses more than once in his sprawling, sharply satirical In the Shadow of No Towers, a collection of strips built by Spiegelman over the last three years and finally published by Pantheon Books just before the third anniversary of 9/11. </p> <p>In his foreword to No Towers, Spiegelman writes that the book's gorgeous \"single-page units,\" printed on 42 pages of heavy card stock and designed to resemble the Sunday newspaper comics panels of a bygone era, \"corresponded to my existential conviction that I might not live long enough to see them published.\" His parents' ordeal in Auschwitz at the hands of the Nazis, he goes on, taught him to \"always keep [his] bags packed.\" Spiegelman freely admits that the psychic terrors of 9/11 corresponded to a deep-seated \"self-inflicted\" trauma, a fervent belief that Armageddon - both the religious conflict and the Bruce Willis movie - was, as the Rolling Stones sang in Gimme Shelter, \"just a shot away\". </p> <p>This kind of unrelenting dread has kept artists of all kinds in full sublimation mode since the invention of the cave drawing, and has provided human culture with no shortage of standout works. But this latent fear has also invigorated the capitalist schadenfreude of everyone from Fox News to Manhattan street merchants to the Bush administration, not to mention the supposedly liberal New York publications that avoided Spiegelman's post-9/11 rants like they were undocumented Arab immigrants. And Spiegelman, always the astute cultural critic, knows this better than anyone. </p> <p>Indeed, his July-August 2003 installment of the No Towers series dedicates itself to the profit others have reaped off the backs of citizens thrown into chaos by a national tragedy. In one of two vertical strips (as with everything Spiegelman, the arrangement and construction of his comics deviate from standard convention whenever possible), one of the artist's doppelgangers holds up a garish tourist trap clock emblazoned with the twin towers, a looming American eagle, FDNY figurines and a United States flag, confessing that he was an eyewitness and even a participant in \"the bombardment of kitsch\" that hit the US after 9/11 like an X-rated Xtina video on Kazaa. </p> <p>In the second strip, the same clock blows up like a bomb in Spiegelman's face, as cowboy boots branded with dollar signs fall from the sky on a fleeing populace filled with cartoon legends like Annie, Wimpy, Hapless Hooligan (who repeatedly serves, as do the meek mice from Maus, as a Spiegelman alter ego), Charlie Brown and many more. Even this summer's Republican National Convention - the capitalization on misfortune to end all capitalizations on misfortune - is identified by the author as an example of tragedy \"transformed into travesty\". This must-have collection of hard-hitting, self-deprecating strips on life during wartime was ignored during its creation by the very publications that made Spiegelman a big name in New York literary and artistic circles: the New York Times, the New York Review of Books and the New Yorker (which has both commissioned Spiegelman for cover art and employed his wife, Francoise Mouly, as an art editor). As he admits in the foreword, \"Outside of the left-leaning alternative press, mainstream publications that have actively solicited work from me ... fled when I offered these pages or excerpts from the series.\" In fact, the only mainstream homes for his controversial work were found in the countries - Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands - that were lambasted by Donald Rumsfeld and George W Bush as \"old Europe\" and derided by the American media. </p> <p>In a sense, this neglect helped push the work further. \"The feelings of dislocation reflected in these No Towers pages,\" Spiegelman writes, \"arose in part from the lack of outcry against the outrages [of the Bush administration] while they were being committed\". Now, in the most heated political season of recent generations, those who once spurned Spiegelman's work have recovered their cojones, and No Towers is something of a hot commodity. </p> <p>New Yorkers like rapper El-P, quoted above, are justifiably sick and tired of facile 9/11 sympathies that turn out to be marketing gimmicks. But no one's going to accuse Spiegelman of cashing in on the tragedy's third anniversary, and not just because he is a New York lifer who has consistently raged against the machines of oppression and manipulation since his days editing the seminal 80s graphic mag Raw. The Pantheon press kit is now packed with fawning headlines from the publications that showed him the door two years ago, but Spiegelman can only control what ends up on the spectacular colored pages that set In the Shadow of No Towers apart from every other 9/11 interrogation. </p> <p>As Spiegelman notes in No Towers while fleeing the crumbling World Trade Center and encountering a giant billboard for Arnold Schwarzenegger's fireman-revenge drama Collateral Damage, irony is not dead. Neither is the idea that art can sometimes transcend the pleasure, pain and callous commerce of the world that generates it. Spiegelman's highly personal exploration of the horrors of 9/11 and how they nearly destroyed him (even as they were being perverted by the \"Architects of Armageddon,\" as he calls Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld, into a blank check for imperial aggression) offers a more powerful criticism of postmodern America's state of affairs than most of those found in this season's Bush-bashing titles. Even better, this lavishly produced, eye-popping collection costs only $20 - a bargain for a work of comics art this sophisticated (and likely to become a collector's item). </p> <p>If anything, the fact that the American intelligentsia finally seems ready to admit that Spiegelman was speaking truth to power in the dark years of 2002 and 2003 ought to make us sleep a little better at night - at least until, as Spiegelman explains in No Towers, the sky starts falling again and the duct tape market catches fire.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Scott Thill is the editor of Morphizm.com and the author of Salon's \"Writing in the Margins\" column.

  "<p>On Wednesday, Nasa scientists watched in shock as their Genesis solar project ended in disaster. \"I can't believe it\" they all said. \"A space mission that went wrong? This is completely unprecedented. I mean, the last time a major space project ended in embarrassing failure was way, way back in January when our Mars rover broke down, and then before that the Beagle 2 project lost contact with its probe, oh and then there was last year's Columbia disaster, oh and the Hubble Telescope fiasco, but apart from that our record is very impressive.\" From now on Nasa is going to launch its rockets on the 4th of July, just so that everyone thinks they're meant to explode. </p> <p>We had been promised a dramatic re-entry for the Genesis capsule, which was set to return its precious payload of atomic solar particles after a three-year mission. Stunt pilots hired from Hollywood for the occasion were on standby waiting to hook up with the capsule as it entered the Earth's atmosphere, but they failed to connect because they couldn't see out of their Jedi helmets. \"Sorry, can we go for another take on that one?\" \"Er - no, actually.\" </p> <p>After the parachutes failed to open the capsule crashed to earth and the scientists found their precious parcel smashed open and the contents scattered all over the ground; it couldn't have been worse if they had paid the extra for Royal Mail registered post. The whole point of this trip was to bring back pure uncontaminated atoms from the sun. Now they're going to have to gather up everything they find on that patch of ground in Utah and painstakingly analyse all of it. \"It's amazing; solar explosions seem to be emitting old burger cartons, cigarette butts and Wal-Mart shopping bags.\" </p> <p>The team did their best to remain positive: \"There are a lot of things that had to happen in series and we got just about all of them done and we just did not get the last two or three done,\" said Genesis project manager Don Sweetnam. Oh well, that's all right then. Maybe I'm being a little picky, but if I was plummeting to the ground at 200mph, and one of those last details included the failure of my parachute to open, I'd struggle to be upbeat about all the other things that had gone so well. </p> <p>How do they get the insurance for all these missions? Perhaps they just have to hope they get a particularly dim telesales rep when they ring the insurance company. \"So, are there any additional drivers you would like listed on the policy?\" </p> <p>\"Well there are no actual 'drivers' as such, it's a remote-control space explorer capsule costing $250m.\" </p> <p>\"Right, no additional drivers and will you be using it for business or leisure?\" </p> <p>\"Well, mainly for catching atoms ejected in solar explosions.\" </p> <p>\"I'll click 'leisure' then, and can I have the postcode where the vehicle will be kept, please?\" </p> <p>\"Well, for the next two years it will be in orbit at temperatures of thousands of degrees, trying to dodge solar explosions, meteorites and collisions with the planet Mercury.\" </p> <p>\"That's all right, sir, as long as it's not going to be parked in Hackney or Liverpool.\" </p> <p>The so-called Genesis project received its massive funding before they realised that it had nothing to do with taking Phil Collins into deep space. In fact, the naming of the craft is not without an irony of its own, since the purpose of this trip was to inform us about the origins of our solar system. Yet the president who is paying for it all has passed an education bill allowing creationism to creep back into American schools. Why does he need to spend millions on the space probe, to find out what he says Americans can read in the Book of Genesis? Could it be that he's only claiming to take the Bible at face value in order to secure votes in America's bible belt? Or maybe they just told him that with all that fire coming off the sun there must be some oil in there somewhere? </p> <p>With the tide of Christian fundamentalism that is increasingly directing scientific funding in America, soon Nasa won't be able to send out any more probes unless they are looking for a big bloke with a white beard sitting on a cloud surrounded by angels. But though their latest mission has ended in disaster, maybe this week Nasa just settled the science versus religion debate for once and for all. A huge lump of metal comes flying out of the sky at 200mph, crash lands in the United States, but it completely misses President George W Bush. Clearly there is no God; what more proof does anyone need? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>There is no evidence to support a link between the controversial MMR jab and the development of autism in children, researchers said today. </p> <p>Concern about a reported link between the triple vaccine and the disorder has led to a drop in the number of parents getting their children vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella in the UK. </p> <p>But research funded by the Medical Research Council today concluded that the team could find no evidence of a link between autism and MMR. </p> <p>Controversy over the jab was first sparked after a small-scale study published in the Lancet and led by Dr Andrew Wakefield suggested a link with autism and bowel problems in 1998. </p> <p>After that, various large-scale studies failed to find any evidence of a link and Dr Wakefield's own research was later discredited. </p> <p>The latest study, also published in the Lancet, looked at the vaccination records of 1,294 children diagnosed with autism or other pervasive development disorders (PDDs) between 1987 and 2001 in England and Wales. </p> <p>The children in the sample were compared with a control group of 4,469 children of the same sex and similar age who were registered with the same practices but did not have a recorded diagnosis of autism. </p> <p>The researchers, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, were unable to find evidence to support an association between MMR and autism or other PDDs. </p> <p>The team, led by Dr Liam Smeeth, went on to look in more depth at the records, looking only at children who had MMR before their third birthday - autism is not normally diagnosed before the age of three. </p> <p>They also looked at children vaccinated in the period before reporting of the theory that MMR might be linked with autism. The researchers finally compared children who joined practices before their first birthday with those joining after this age. Again their conclusion was that there was no link between MMR and autism. </p> <p>The researchers also reviewed previously reported studies that examined the possibility of a link, but none of these showed any increased risk of autism associated with MMR. The study team concluded that their combined results increased the strength of the assessment - also backed by the Department of Health and medical experts - that there was no evidence of a link between the combined vaccination and autism. </p> <p>Public concern about the MMR jab has led to vaccination coverage of children before the age of two falling from around 92% in 1995-96 to 82% in 2002-03. </p> <p>Vaccination is now below the level needed to avoid epidemics of measles - a potentially life-threatening infection. Outbreaks of measles have already been seen in areas of the UK with very low uptake of the vaccine. </p> <p>Dr Smeeth said he hoped their findings would help boost public confidence in the vaccination. \"We hope the results of this study, the most robust and comprehensive undertaken to date, will reassure parents that MMR is not associated with an increased risk of developing autism. </p> <p>\"Our findings are consistent with evidence from a growing body of high quality scientific studies. It is now time to move on and focus on research into other potential causes of autism which is urgently needed.\"</p> <p>Dr Smeeth added that the absence of knowledge about autism may have contributed to the \"misplaced emphasis\" on MMR as a cause. </p> <p>A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"This study shows that having MMR is not a risk factor for autism. The study is in full agreement with other international studies carried out in different ways, by different researchers, in different countries.\"</p> <p>She added: \"MMR is recognised by the World Health Organisation as having an outstanding safety record.\"</p>",

  "Armed police in Thailand are hunting one of their own officers who is suspected of murdering a British backpacking couple following a late-night row in a riverside restaurant. <p>The killing of 25-year-old Adam Lloyd and his girlfriend, Vanessa Arscott, 23, both from Devon, is alleged to have been committed by a police ser-geant in the tourist area of Kanchanaburi.</p> <p>The town is on the river Kwai at the point where, during the second world war, the occupying Japanese army constructed an infamous railway bridge using British prisoners as slave labour. There is a large Commonwealth war cemetery nearby.</p> <p>The explosive quarrel between Mr Lloyd, Ms Arscott and Sgt Somchai Visetsingha began in the early hours at the S&amp;S restaurant on River Kwai Road.</p> <p>One source suggested the policeman was the owner of the eating house and initially tried to mediate in the couple's row.</p> <p>But according to senior police officers, all three had been arguing. The dispute apparently focused on the attention being paid to Ms Arscott by other men. Major Chavalit Peakeaw said: \"The male tourist was apparently upset by the way other people looked at his girlfriend and his jealousy got out of control.\"</p> <p>Another police officer suggested she had been having an affair with the sergeant. The two backpackers, however, had only arrived in Kanchanaburi a week earlier. A third version suggested the policeman had tried to abduct Ms Arscott.</p> <p>The unfolding row was witnessed by a number of late- night diners. There are conflicting accounts of what happened next. According to some police briefings, Ms Arscott left the restaurant first in tears.</p> <p>Sgt Visetsingha and Mr Lloyd followed in the policeman's car. The couple reportedly quarrelled again and Mr Lloyd fought with the sergeant. The Britons then walked off together but after they had gone a short distance the car caught up with them and there was a volley of gunshots.</p> <p>Mr Lloyd collapsed, fatally injured. The car was then driven at speed at his girlfriend. She was struck and dragged along the road for about 100 yards. When the car stopped a man got out and fired two shots, hitting her in the head and body.</p> <p>Other reports said the couple had left the restaurant together and had then been approached by the car.</p> <p>They were taken to a local hospital but pronounced dead from multiple wounds.</p> <p>Police colonel Ves Somboon said an arrest warrant had been issued for Sgt Viset-singha, whose Volvo car was found marked with blood and flesh. Sgt Visetsingha had been missing since the shooting. Col Somboon added: \"We hope to get him soon. The witnesses and evidence show that he is the man who gunned down the British tourists.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office in London confirmed the Britons had been murdered and said it was providing assistance to their families. Embassy officials travelled to Kanchanaburi, 70 miles west of Bangkok, to assist the investigation.</p> <p>Mr Lloyd's mother Linda -who runs the Buckingham Lodge Hotel in Torquay, Devon, with her husband, Brian - described her son as \"a lovely lad _ He and Vanessa had been travelling together for two months. It was something he always wanted to do.\"</p> <p>Mr Lloyd, a travel agent, had been due to fly home last week but had been unable to get a flight.

  "Tony Blair will be confronted with a fresh challenge over Iraq within the next two weeks when the long-awaited final report of the Iraq Survey Group concludes there were no weapons of mass destruction in the country at the time of the US-UK invasion. <p>The Guardian has learned that the team of weapons inspectors sent in by Washington and London at the end of the war to comb Iraq will find that though the threat of Saddam Hussein was real, there were no stockpiles. </p> <p>The absence of banned weapons has long been suspected, but the finality of the report's conclusion, together with its timing on the eve of the Labour party conference in Brighton, will be controversial. </p> <p>It may encourage Labour critics who want a show of repentance from Mr Blair and a promise of no more pre-emptive wars to be more vocal. The prime minister had hoped to focus the conference on domestic issues. </p> <p>The news of the latest Iraq threat to Mr Blair's political leadership came as he completed a reshuffle designed to shore up his embattled premiership. Alan Milburn, the new policy supremo, attended the week's cabinet and urged his colleagues to \"pull together\". </p> <p>Although it has been obvious since last year that the Iraq Survey Group was unlikely to unearth anything, its final verdict is an embarrassment to President Bush and Mr Blair. </p> <p>Before the invasion, both governments claimed Saddam had a covert programme to produce chemical and biological weapons, to manufacture ballistic missiles and had renewed its search for a nuclear bomb. Mr Blair did, however, soften his stance in July, telling MPs: \"I have to accept that we have not found them and that we may not find them.\" </p> <p>The prime minister also faces other looming difficulties which could further rock his political stability through the autumn. They include: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Hunting. The latest compromise - a total ban but preceded by a two-year delay - was designed in part to assuage Labour backbenchers worried about government drift. But critics of the hunting bill have been incensed by the timeframe and are threatening to tear the legislation apart. Since the pro-hunting peers are also determined to wreck the compromise, No 10 may be back to square one. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> TUC conference. Mr Blair faces persistent resentment and a potentially hostile reception from the TUC next week when he speaks in Brighton. The leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union today launches an attack on \"politicians squabbling like ferrets in a sack\" and warns that a fragile truce between government and unions would be shattered if manifesto promises are broken. </p> <p>In today's Guardian, Tony Woodley, the union's general secretary, warns the prime minister that the reform package agreed at July's party policy forum meeting in Warwick is an inviolable base line. </p> <p>\"It is one of the unfortunate weaknesses in the way 'new Labour' does its business that whenever unity appears to be breaking out in the party, division and discord is stirred up again,\" he writes. </p> <p>Five days of clashes at the top of government have left critics of Mr Blair inside the party emboldened. Some prominent backbench figures say if the prime minister makes one more serious misjudgment, they will trigger a challenge to his leadership. </p> <p>In the short term, Mr Blair's hand has been strengthened by a reshuffle that saw the return of his key ally, Mr Milburn, the former health secretary, to run the coming election campaign in place of Gordon Brown. Yesterday the prime minister went further when he plucked the 36-year-old highflyer Ruth Kelly from the chancellor's Treasury team to be Mr Milburn's deputy. </p> <p>Touring the TV and radio studios, Mr Milburn dismissed suggestions that Mr Brown is being sidelined as \"complete nonsense\". This did not disguise bitterness in the Brown camp over the apparent reduction of his election campaign role. \"When I hear people saying that somebody who is such a towering figure as Gordon - who has played such a big part in this government and its achievements - isn't going to have a key role in this general election campaign, that is cloud-cuckoo land,\" Mr Milburn insisted. </p> <p>The return of Mr Milburn has undoubtedly upset the chancellor's camp, though one official played this down yesterday. \"If Gordon is being excluded and is not playing the same role as in the last two big victories, we will shrug our shoulders and get on with the job,\" he said. </p> <p>Ten junior posts swapped hands yesterday without a sacking. Douglas Alexander, a Brown protege who gave up the honorific title Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to Mr Milburn, also lost his Cabinet Office job working on policy to Ms Kelly.He takes Mike O'Brien's trade brief at the Foreign Office while Stephen Timms moves back to the Treasury in Ms Kelly's old job, financial secretary, and Mr O'Brien gets Mr Timms' post of energy minister.</p>",
  "Schools are being forced to transfer money from teaching, books and equipment to fund \"out of control\" exam costs of \u00a3380m a year, headteachers warned yesterday. <p>The Secondary Heads Association said the price tag, inflated partly by a doubling in exam fees in just four years, was evidence of a bloated examinations system. Some sixth form colleges are having to spend as much as \u00a3400,000 a year on fees and running costs for AS and A-levels, making exams the second biggest budget item after staffing. </p> <p>An average comprehensive spends \u00a3132,000 on external exams, through a combination of fees, administration and invigilation. With no increase in government funding to subsidise spiralling costs, schools are having to raid other budgets, the union warned. </p> <p>The SHA vice-president, Sue Kirkham, head at Walton high school in Staffordshire, said her school had frozen the cash given to heads of department to spend on \"text books, equipment, teaching and learning\" to finance exam costs. </p> <p>The union argues that UK schools and pupils are among the most overburdened with exams of any in the world, a problem that is expected to be acknowledged in the government-commissioned Tomlinson report on 14-19 qualifications, due next month. </p> <p>More than 30m papers are sat annually by pupils, who take national tests at seven, 11 and 14, and external exams including GCSEs, AS and A-levels. The rising cost is only one disadvantage cited by heads. Others include excessive time spent in schools on preparing for exams, stress affecting pupils, and concerns about marking quality amid the pressures of a complex exam system requiring thousands of qualified markers. </p> <p>SHA's solution, outlined yesterday, is a system of so-called chartered examiners - experienced teachers who would be accredited to carry out assessment in their own schools of pupils' achievements during a course according to external standards, potentially cutting external exams by half and saving significant sums. </p> <p>The proportion of \"in-course assessment\" would vary according to subjects, but could see external assessment through exams cut by half. </p> <p>A separate SHA report, due next month, will make the case for taking A-level exams earlier than at present, so pupils can apply to universities on the basis of their actual grades. </p> <p>The study is designed to show that the concept, backed in principle by ministers, can work, by bringing back the date of exam results by several weeks and slightly delaying the start of the university year. Faster electronic marking would help make the change possible, the SHA general secretary, John Dunford, said. </p> <p>Post-qualification admissions will be backed by Steven Schwartz, vice-chancellor of Brunel University, who is due to publish his recommendations for reforming university admissions. </p> <p>Speaking yesterday at a conference held by the Social Market Foundation, Professor Schwartz also said all sixth formers should be offered the chance to sit a US-style university entrance exam as part of any new qualifications regime.</p>",

  "<p>ING Direct, this year's winner of the award for best savings account provider, burst onto the scene in May 2003 offering a simple, \"no catches\" savings account with a market beating rate.</p> <p>Reactions were mixed. \"It certainly scared competitors initially,\" says a commentator from financial data provider Moneyfacts, though rivals comforted themselves with the belief that the new account had to be a loss leader with a headline-grabbing rate that could never be maintained. But - so far at least - the sceptics have been proved wrong. ING Direct's savings account has managed to maintain consistently high rates, regularly appearing in best buy tables particularly when compared with similar accounts that offer transparent rates with no short-term, high introductory bonuses.</p> <p>ING Direct had attracted 500,000 new customers by the end of its first year - \"totally smashing our initial targets,\" says chief executive Lindsay Sinclair. It has since added another 100,000 plus accountholders and recent research shows that 99% of its customers would recommend the account to others.</p> <p>ING Direct's no-notice account, currently paying 5% gross/AER to all its savers on balances from \u00a31 to \u00a32m, makes a marketing virtue of its simplicity, condemning the temporary introductory bonuses and withdrawal restrictions used by competitors as confusing and complex for consumers. </p> <p>\"We think such tactics distort the real rates of interest being offered and make it hard for people to realistically compare the returns on offer,\" Mr Sinclair says. \"We are the natural home for committed savers who should look for accounts paying long term consistent rates with 'no catches'.\"</p> <p>Moneyfacts points out, however, that there are many switched-on savers keen and willing to move their accounts every six months to a year in order to obtain even higher rates than ING Direct can offer from providers offering introductory bonuses. </p> <p>And, not surprisingly, rivals still voice a note of caution about ING Direct's ability to maintain its competitive edge. A spokesman for Egg says: \"Overall, it's a good thing for consumers that newer entrants like ourselves and ING Direct are stirring up the market and forcing more traditional providers to pay better rates of interest - the more the merrier as far as we are concerned. </p> <p>\"Unlike ourselves, however, ING Direct is offering no guarantees that it will continue to be so competitive once it reaches the number of customers it's aiming for. So the onus is on customers to keep their eye on rates.\" </p> <p>Lindsay Sinclair is insistent, however, that the savings account is no loss leader and that ING Direct can maintain its high rates and high level of customer service.</p> <p> \"At launch, we were told we were too good to be true, that our rates were introductory offers only,\" he says. \" We have proved all the doubters and cynics wrong with consistently good rates coupled with excellent customer service. Our goal is to be the number one UK direct savings bank and we believe we are well on the way to achieving this. We will go from strength to strength and are here to stay.\"</p> <p>Satisfied saver</p> <p>Jamie Griffin, a PhD student from London, was on the look out for a savings account last year as a home for \u00a320,000 compensation he received after being injured in a car accident in the US. He chose the ING Direct account primarily for its high rate and because it allowed him to easily transfer money in and out online from his existing current account with internet bank Smile.</p> <p>\"Obviously when the Bank of England rate goes up, I check to see if the ING rate goes up too and it usually does,\" he says. \"I have seen accounts offering slightly better rates, but there are usually restrictions attached I don't want. I like the fact that my ING account is straightforward, easy to manage and pays a consistently high rate.\" </p> <p>A year in savings</p> <p>\u00b7 November 2003 - Savers were urged to come forward and lay claim to the \u00a31.5bn lying dormant in National Savings &amp; Investments accounts using NS&amp;I's free tracing service designed to reunite people with forgotten money. \u00b7 February 2004 - Research from Marks &amp; Spencer Money revealed that people still tend only to save with a specific goal in mind. Only a third of people who save do so to build up an emergency fund. \u00b7 March 2004. The Halifax shook up the market by launching a savings account for regular savers paying an inflation-busting rate of 6.05%, the highest rate offered by a provider for two years. \u00b7 April 2004. Tessa took her last bow after 13 years on the savings stage as the final five-year Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts reached maturity at the end of the tax year. Savers were able to roll over their original Tessa investment into new Toisas - Tessa-only Individual Savings Accounts. \u00b7 June 2004. A survey by financial data provider Moneyfacts showed that savings rates had increased greatly over the previous year by more than the 0.75% base rate increase. \u00b7 July 2004. National Savings &amp; Investments axed its 143-year-old Ordinary Account, known to many people as the Post Office savings account, because it was \"old fashioned\" and too expensive to operate for the taxpayer.</p> <p>Savings tips</p> <p>\u00b7 Shop around for the best rates. Useful tools include the savings compare and buy service at www.theguardian.com and best buy tables at www.moneyfacts.co.uk. \u00b7 Bear in mind that branch-based savings accounts generally pay lower rates than those operated by post, phone and/or internet. \u00b7 'Notice' accounts, where you can only withdraw funds after giving prior notice of several days or weeks, no longer pay the highest rates. No-notice accounts, where the most competition is nowadays, now typically offer some of the best rates. \u00b7 Ignore high introductory rates and bonuses which usually only last a few months, unless you plan to regularly switch accounts to chase the best rates. \u00b7 Decide if you want a variable rate, which will go up and down with general interest rates, or a fixed rate, which is a good bet when base rates are falling but could leave you locked into a poor return if they rise? \u00b7 Check out www.fsa.gov.uk/consumer, the website of City watchdog the Financial Services Authority which offers advice on what to consider when comparing accounts. \u00b7 Look at the tax treatment of an account. Does it offer tax-free interest as do mini cash ISAs, for example? If not, remember you'll get less than the 'gross' (before tax) rate if you're a taxpayer. Non-taxpayers can arrange to be paid interest gross by filling in form an IR85, available from banks and building societies.</p>",
  "<p>In contrast to some of this year's winners, Clerical Medical, which takes the award for best stakeholder and personal pension provider, is certainly no new boy on the block.</p> <p>The company - now part of the giant HBOS Group created when the Halifax Group and Bank of Scotland merged in 2001 - has specialised in investing for the future, offering long-term investments and pensions since 1824. </p> <p>With almost all of its business sold through financial advisers, it has 1.74 million policyholders and a total staff of 3,800 in the UK spread throughout its Bristol headquarters, two customer service centres and six regional offices.</p> <p>Clerical Medical is number two in the stakeholder pensions with 18% of the market and fifth in the regular premium personal pensions market, according to recent figures from trade publication Money Marketing. It is also the leading company in the executive pensions market. </p> <p>All the ingredients for success are there. \"We have a range of good, reliable personal pensions products with a competitive charging structure including a 'large fund bonus' which means that as a customer's fund reaches a certain size, the annual management charge goes down in increments,\" says John Hiew, managing director of Clerical Medical Financial Services. \"We've got financial stability and strength as part of the HBOS Group and we work hard at maintaining high levels of customer service which we recognise as being at the heart of our business.\"</p> <p>Yet it's hard to pinpoint one unique factor, either on the product or customer service front, that puts Clerical Medical head and shoulders above its major competitors and explains why consumers have voted it top pension provider this year.</p> <p>The company's success, according to pension experts, is more down to a combination of factors that gel to give it a leading edge in the popularity stakes.</p> <p>Stuart Grennan, financial planning director at independent financial advisers Torquil Clark, says: \"Everything has become very much the same between pension providers since stakeholder pensions came in. Most personal pensions and stakeholders have a very similar mono charge structure and the majority of the big boys' default pension funds are much of a muchness in looking for a safe, average performance.\"</p> <p>So, if you are looking for a stakeholder pension, for example, there is not much to choose between the major players on the performance front. Your decision is more likely to depend on cost differences and, most importantly, your image of the company.</p> <p>\"The main differentiator nowadays between pension providers is 'brand',\" Mr Grennan explains. \"For most people when choosing a pension, it comes down to whether it's a brand they feel they can trust as a safe, reputable, long-term provider and Clerical Medical scores highly in that regard. It has financial strength as part of the HBOS Group. It has kept out of trouble with the regulator and it has a good advertising campaign that reinforces that 'brand'.\"</p> <p>Clerical Medical would not disagree wildly with that assessment. John Hiew says: \"Our popularity is down to our good range of competitive products, our strong financial base and strength and our attention to delivering excellent service and a consistently good customer experience.\"</p> <p>Impressed investor</p> <p>Geoffrey Loman, a 62-year old retired sales manager from Kent was keen to transfer some \u00a370,000 he had in an Alba Life personal pension after reading press reports suggesting the fund performance there was below par.</p> <p>\"I wanted to make the most of the money that I'd built up particularly at my age, so I used the pension transfer analysis service offered by Hargreaves Lansdown to find out the best stakeholder pension for me to move it to.\"</p> <p>The non-advisory service came up with Clerical Medical as the most cost-effective home for Mr Loman's money largely because, at the time, the company was offering to enhance transfers by 1.5% of the fund transferred. </p> <p>\"Because of Clerical Medical's good reputation and their financial strength as part of HBOS, I felt I would be safer in their hands than in those of many other providers,\" Mr Loman says.</p> <p>A year in pensions \u00b7 October 2003: Pensions Secretary Andrew Smith announced plans to introduce an annual \"financial health check\" for every employee outlining what they can expect at retirement from private and state pension schemes. \u00b7 March 2004. The chancellor confirmed the government would go ahead with a simplification of pensions rules first proposed in December 2003, but said the new tax regime would not now come into force until April 2006. \u00b7 March 2004. Government research revealed that, while 35% of employers now offer employees access to a stakeholder pension, three-quarters of these schemes do not have any active members. \u00b7 April 2004. The government increased to \u00a31.5m the maximum tax-free amount that people can accumulate over their working lives under the new pension regime starting in 2006. \u00b7 May 2004. The government announced plans to set up a \u00a3400m fund to compensate workers who lost pensions when their firms went bankrupt. \u00b7 June 2004. Young people face poverty in their retirement, according to TUC research which revealed that only half of people under the age of 30 are in a pension scheme, a figure far lower than in the 1950s and 60s. \u00b7 June 2004. The government announced plans to raise the price cap on stakeholder pensions from 1% to 1.5% from April 2005. The annual management charge of 1.5% will apply for the first 10 years that the product is held before falling to 1%.</p> <p> Pension tips \u00b7 Pensions are a long-term investment. You can't get money you put into a pension out until retirement age and, if you drop out earlier, you may lose much of the money you've already paid in. So weigh up your options carefully. \u00b7 Impartial information about your pension options is available at: www.pensionguide.gov.uk; www.thepensionservice.gov.uk; and www.fsa.gov.uk/consumer. The Pensions Advisory Service on 0845 601 2923 (www.opas.org.uk) can help with queries on occupational, stakeholder and personal pensions. \u00b7 If you can join an occupational pension scheme, this is usually the best way to save for retirement. \u00b7 If you can't join an occupational pension - say, you're self-employed - you'll have to shop around for your own stakeholder or personal pension. \u00b7 If you can join a stakeholder or group personal pension plan through work, this may offer better value than a plan you arrange for yourself, especially if your employer contributes to your plan. \u00b7 When choosing a plan, shop around and compare different providers - their charges, reputation and penalties for changing schemes. \u00b7 Make sure it's the right plan for you. Some schemes offer flexibility if, for example, you want a break from payments or to change the amount you pay. Some let you control where your money is invested. \u00b7 If in doubt about the right option, consider consulting an independent financial adviser, but remember you may have to pay for their advice.</p>",
  "<p>Robbie Williams is top of the charts again. With a new single, Radio, and a greatest hits album out next month, he is currently celebrating the success of Feel, his new official biography. The book has become an instant bestseller since its publication a week ago, its sales outstripping its nearest rival by three to one, and the former member of Take That, whose anthemic songs have been the soundtrack for a generation, is back where he belongs: in the spotlight. </p> <p>Since the 30-year-old's split with Take That nine years ago, his career has been forged in the tabloids. It has boosted Williams's record sales, but his music is increasingly drowned out by the clamour of stories and speculation about his love life, fluctuating weight, personal demons and peccadillos. </p> <p>In the past year, with little musical activity and no album released, he has still been mentioned in the press on average more than five times every day. He admits he has courted fame, but is increasingly, and very publicly, jaded and dismayed by it. </p> <p>\"Fame is like having a little baby,\" he says in Feel, written by his friend, the music journalist Chris Heath. \"It's really great and really lovely and it takes its first steps and you're there and you cry, and then it dances a little bit, and you're there and cry too ... and then it shits itself and it pukes everywhere and then it goes through the terrible twos when it pulls things off and it burns itself and all that sort of stuff, and you just want to go, 'This is great, can I give it you back for a little bit while I do this?'\" </p> <p>If Williams's career and relationship with the media is a battle for control, the new book is his latest offensive. \"The bigger stars get, the more about control it becomes,\" says Paul Scott, his unofficial biographer, whose rival tome, Robbie Williams: Angels and Demons, has also been a bestseller. </p> <p>There is plenty to write about the music business veteran, who joined Take That at 16, blossomed in the boy band, sold millions of copies of songs like Angels as a solo artist, signed the biggest recording contract in British record history two years ago and upstaged Oasis by playing three colossal, sell-out concerts at Knebworth last year. </p> <p>But few want to tell the tale. Williams, who has sought the sanctuary of Los Angeles for the last two years, appears to exert a remarkable influence: friends and enemies are equally reluctant to talk about the megastar. Falling out with Williams can cost dear, and for the many who have fallen, talking about him still causes too much hassle. According to music business sources, some have been excommunicated even when they have publicly flattered Rob, as he is known by those close to him. </p> <p>Frustrated, the tabloids bite back. \"Feel seems to be about a man in his prime who has become paranoid, miserable, lonely and utterly self-obsessed,\" wrote Derek Brown, deputy showbiz editor of the Sun. </p> <p>While the book confirms many of the conquests exposed by the press, Williams tells Heath he has never truly been in love. He has friends - some of whom, like his former housemate Jonathan Wilkes, he has known since he was a child. But he also feels plenty of hatred. </p> <p>Williams continues to hurl vitriol at Gary Barlow, initially perceived as \"the talented one\" in Take That, who was at first more successful as a solo artist. After his acrimonious split from what was then Britain's biggest pop group in 1995, Williams was befriended by Noel and Liam Gallagher, then kings of Britpop. Paranoid and taking too much cocaine, according to Williams, they fell out spectacularly. Williams told the press he would fight Liam in the ring for a \u00a3100,000 charity purse and he still snipes at Noel. </p> <p>\"A real bitterness creeps in whenever there is a fall-out,\" says Scott. \"He could be magnanimous with Gary Barlow now. Robbie has sold 25m records, while Gary is quite chubby and living in Cheshire. But that burning resentment keeps coming back and that's what drives him to keep going.\" </p> <p>The book stirs things up further. Williams calls his first manager, Nigel Martin-Smith, \"spawn of Satan\", and dispenses verbal lashings to Cameron Diaz, Westlife and Christina Aguilera. It makes for a bestseller, but his supporters claim Feel is more than a settling of old scores or a timely way to publicise his greatest hits package. </p> <p>\"Rob is never going to sit down with a ghostwriter and pretend to write an autobiography,\" says his editor, Hannah MacDonald, of Ebury Press. \"That's not his style. What he has done is not dissimilar to Billy Connolly, whose wife, Pamela Stephenson, wrote his autobiography. He has chosen to have it written by a close friend. Rob's idea was for Chris to hang out with him and tell the story of what it is like to be a hugely watched pop star at this juncture of the 21st century.\" </p> <p>As the man dismissed by Noel Gallagher as \"the fat dancer from Take That\" acknowledges, the turning point in his flagging solo career came in the late 20th century, when he \"found\" Guy Chambers, who became his songwriting partner and co-wrote all his biggest hits. </p> <p>But, as Feel documents, their relationship disintegrated when they argued over royalties and Chambers began writing more songs for other artists, including Natalie Imbruglia and, now, Natasha Bedingfield and Will Young. When told their partnership was over, just as Williams signed a record-breaking \u00a380m deal with EMI in 2002, Chambers - according to Heath - phoned the chairman of EMI to let him know, an unforgivable betrayal in Williams's book. </p> <p>Those around him argue Williams is simply brutally honest, about others and himself. \"The book is not a piece of propaganda,\" says MacDonald. \"You can see as the book unfolds Rob going 'you should probably know about him', or 'you should probably know about her'. We all have our bad days and stubborn days. You get to see them, too. He is a very funny man. He is a very unusual star. He has not played by the rules and he won't.\" </p> <p>Musically, Williams is now at a crossroads. Keen to see a return on its huge investment, EMI is next month to release a greatest hits album, usually a sign that a singer's most creative days are behind them. EMI will carefully monitor how the two new songs, Radio and Misunderstood, are received. After his split with Chambers, both were written with Stephen Duffy, a surprisingly leftfield choice of collaborator. </p> <p>Duffy, 44, left Duran Duran before they became famous and briefly became a solo pop sensation in the mid-80s before releasing a string of obscure but critically acclaimed records with his folk-influenced band The Lilac Time, which still enjoys a cult following. </p> <p>Williams, dubbed \"the Victor Meldrew of pop\" by showbiz correspondents, can hardly complain if his musical output is overshadowed by the tabloids, who have gleefully raked over the loves, hates and rock'n'roll scandals related in the book. </p> <p>His music has always gone hand in hand with his fame, according to Scott. \"It is amazing, the number of people who say they love Robbie Williams but have not got his last record, or the one before that. They just love Robbie as an entity. You have to know the history of Robbie Williams to 'get' his records. If somebody doesn't know his past as the beaten puppy who left Take That and came out with addictions to drink and drugs and came back from the brink to resurrect himself, it is difficult to work out what this guy is saying.\" </p> <p>It is the reason, Scott believes, that Williams has never conquered the US, where people are unaware of his turbulent backstory. For his British fanbase, the book will reawaken their feelings for a singer who has provided, as the best pop music does, the sentimental backing for their lives. </p> <p>\"I think there is enormous affection for Rob,\" says MacDonald. \"Personally, I can refer certain points of my past to Robbie Williams songs. He has been around with us for a while. He is not a saint and he is very honest about not being a saint.\"</p> <p><strong>Life in short</strong></p> <p><strong> Robert Peter Williams</strong> </p> <p><strong> Date of Birth </strong> February 13 1974 </p> <p><strong> Career</strong> Singer, Take That 1990-95, solo 1995-; 11 top 10 singles including six 6 no 1's with Take That; albums with Take That: Take That and Party (1992, UK no 2), Everything Changes (1993, UK no 1); solo singles include: Freedom (1996, UK no 2), Old Before I Die (1997, UK no 2), Angels (1997, UK no 3), Millennium (1998, UK no 1), Rock DJ (2001, UK no 1); solo albums include: Life Thru a Lens (1997, UK no 1), Escapology (2003) </p> <p><strong> Awards </strong> include: best British male solo artist, best British single (Angels), best British video (Millennium), Brits 1999; best British single and video (She's The One), Brits 2000; best British male solo artist, best British single and video (Rock DJ), Brits 2001; best special effects (Rock DJ) MTV Awards 2001; best male singer MTV Europe Awards 2001; best male solo artist, Brits 2002, 2003</p>",
  "<p>While outsourcing and offshoring have entered common parlance in the last 12 months, Britain's financial services companies seem to be developing a particular fondness for them. </p> <p>Convinced that there are huge cost savings to be made from moving call centres and processing work to countries where wages are a quarter of what employees earn in the UK, our banks and insurers are, claims research by consulting firm Deloitte, ready to move 2m of the 13m jobs in financial services to India in the next five years.</p> <p>Offshoring raises huge political and macroeconomic issues. But the reality is that, in most cases, doing your banking via a call centre in Delhi should be no more dangerous than dealing with someone in Derby.</p> <p>Is that your experience? Or has your bank placed cost savings ahead of customer service? Has it become apparent that your insurance company cares more about its shareholders than its policyholders?</p> <p>The annual Guardian and Observer consumer finance awards, in association with Money Observer, offer readers the chance to have their say - an opportunity to check the health of their relationships with banks, insurers, pension providers and credit card companies.</p> <p>Now in their fifth year, the awards are becoming an important benchmark for good customer service. The awards are unique because they reflect the views of a wide range of consumers - the winners are voted for entirely by the readers of the Guardian and The Observer and users of Guardian Unlimited Money and Moneyobserver.com websites.</p> <p>More than 7,000 readers cast their votes in May via an in-paper and online questionnaire. For each category voters were asked to name a provider and to give it a score on a scale of one to five (where five is excellent and one is appalling) to describe the quality of service they have received. Providers were judged against a range of criteria including friendliness of staff, quality of literature, flexibility, efficiency of response to telephone calls, letters and emails and competitiveness. </p> <p>The results were collated by CMRGroup.com Ltd, an independent data capture and research company, which calculated mean scores to ensure that providers were judged on quality of service, and not on quantity of results received. </p> <p>To come top in the overall winner category, a service provider had to be listed in at least three categories and to gain the highest total average score. And for the second year in a row, Smile has won that accolade.</p> <p>Owned by the Co-operative bank, Smile has offered higher than average interest rates on savings (current accounts in particular), while charging less for loans and credit cards. And if that wasn't enough, Smile is also the bank with a conscience, as it refuses to invest in companies that are connected to arms dealing, human rights infringements and that have poor ecological records.</p> <p>But yet Smile would be the first to admit that none of this is as important as offering good, consistent customer service. Earlier this year, Smile commissioned researchers to find out what makes customers want to switch banks. Their findings? We are more likely to change our current account due to a bad experience such as a statement error or a rude member of bank staff than because of low interest or a poor range of products.</p> <p>The awards are an opportunity to applaud the companies who value personal service, whatever the current trends, and practise what they preach. </p>",
  "I have been happily married for 14 years and my husband and I have two children. However, for the past few months, our marriage has been damaged by my husband's jealousy. He says I have been sleeping with neighbours and acquaintances and claims I had a four-year affair. Almost every week he threatens to leave because of my 'lies and deception'. He says he has never trusted me. His jealousy even extends to the close relationship I enjoy with my parents and girlfriends and he seeks to cut me off from them, but I have strongly resisted this so far. He has always believed that women are born to be unfaithful and it was only a matter of time before I would be. I have ignored this in the past and saw our marriage as a success. His jealousy has now made me careful about what I say. I love him dearly and have never been unfaithful. He refuses to go to counselling, saying it is not his problem but mine. I don't want to break up, but I can't carry on knowing that he does not trust me. What can I do? <p><b> He may be unfaithful</b><br> Have you considered the possibility that he may be the one who is having the affair? I lived with a man who had a similar lack of faith in women and he used his jealousy to manipulate me. It meant he could get whatever he wanted without having to negotiate with me. It also alleviated his guilt about his own affair, which I only found out about later. His jealousy made him miserable and, over time, depleted my self-confidence. </p> <p>The longer it goes on, the easier it will be for him to control you - if you have told him categorically that you are not cheating and he still won't believe you then it is time for more drastic action. Build up your resolve and pack a bag. Tell him that you are going to stay with your family and then do just that. Explain to him that he can contact you at any time, but not if he is going to repeat his accusations. Make it clear that the separation is only for one week. </p> <p>Do not give in to this behaviour - it is a classic control technique. Calmly explain that you are considering a divorce if his behaviour towards you does not improve. You have a right not to live in fear and misery due to his whims and moods. <br> <b> AD</b>, via email </p> <p><b> It could be mental illness </b><br> Your husband is displaying all the signs of a serious mental illness and you need to urge him to seek some independent help and advice. This is not rational behaviour and if it is any comfort, it is almost certainly nothing to do with you. When suffering from depression, I also had all these symptoms - particularly the complete loss of trust in anyone. You need to take this seriously - but not personally.  <b> Name and address withheld </b> </p> <p><b> Get medical help for him</b><br> Have you considered the possibility that your husband may have a neuro-psychiatric disorder? Many different medical conditions can present with a relatively sudden onset of morbid jealously in someone who has had no previous history of such behaviour. This includes common illnesses such as depression or rarer conditions such as brain tumours or neuro- degenerative disorders. My advice would be for your husband to have a medical checkup. </p> <p>This may require considerable diplomacy on your part; he is likely to be suspicious of you trying to \"medicalise\" what he sees as your problem, even if you turn out to be right. <br> <b> Dr Hugh Rickards</b>, via email </p> <p><b> You cannot change him </b><br> I was married for 19 years to a man with similar beliefs to those of your husband. I brought an end to our unsatisfactory relationship and left him. You have a choice in this situation, but the only person you can change is yourself. Do you stay knowing he is not going to change, or do you call a halt to a marriage based on negativity? </p> <p>If he will not accept that he is in dire need of counselling, the future is bleak. Apart from you being ground down by such an atmosphere, think about the effect it may be having on your children. Don't they deserve to be around parents who love and care for one another? Do you want them to believe that it is normal for married couples not to trust or respect each other? </p> <p>He can be different; he can be emotionally mature and happy, but he has to make the decision to change himself. <br> <b> DW</b>, Cornwall </p> <p><b> It is his problem, not yours</b><br> My husband has demonstrated similar problems throughout our 12-year marriage. I know how damaging and depressing this is, and how frightening it can be. Your husband needs to know that this is his problem, as I think my husband has now began to acknowledge. In our relationship, stressful situations, such as job insecurity, sparked off accusations of infidelity. My husband also experienced the break-up of his parents' marriage and he was badly let down by both parents during his childhood. These experiences may have led to him not being able to trust and his tendency always to anticipate some sort of betrayal. This does not excuse his behaviour, but trying to understand why someone may end up behaving like this may offer some explanation. </p> <p>Please be aware of how your self-esteem may suffer if you try to change your behaviour to avoid his jealousy. On reflection, that is what I did, to the extent that I ended up neglecting my appearance and having no social life. The support of family and friends will help you during the difficult times, so don't cut yourself off from them. <br> <b> Name and address withheld </b> </p> <p> <b>Next week:</b> I am a 47-year-old single woman with multiple sclerosis and heart disease.

  "The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, dramatically increased pressure on the Sudanese government yesterday by declaring the killings and destruction in its Darfur region to be genocide. <p>Mr Powell, directly blaming the Sudanese government, said: \"This was a coordinated effort, not just random violence.\"</p> <p>The US now has an obligation under international law to act. Labelling violence as genocide is relatively rare.</p> <p>Mr Powell's declaration follows a report from US state department investigators who spent five weeks taking evidence from 1,136 refugees attacked by the government-backed Janjaweed militia.</p> <p>Foreign Office minister Chris Mullin said last night that events in Darfur \"may well be genocide\".</p> <p>\"What would have to be demonstrated in order for the Sudanese government to be accused of genocide was that they had the intent to commit genocide, and that hasn't been demonstrated yet,\" Mr Mullin said on Channel 4 news. \"Whatever you call it, there is no doubt that grave crimes against humanity have been committed in Darfur.\"</p> <p>The US and British governments have been reluctant to declare the destruction of lives and villages in Darfur to be genocide because of the international legal obligations and to avoid unnecessarily antagonising the Sudanese government.</p> <p>Mr Powell is to press the UN to set up an international commission \"with a view to ensuring accountability\". The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, is backing the commission proposal.</p> <p>Mr Powell said: \"I concluded that genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility and that genocide may still be occurring.\"</p> <p>The Sudanese government rejected the charge. Najeeb al-Khair Abdel-Wahab, the deputy foreign minister, said he expected the international community to assist, \"not put oil on the fire\".</p> <p>An estimated 40,000 people have been killed and 1.2 million have fled their homes as a result of the violence.</p> <p>Genocide is defined under a law drawn up after the second world war as \"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\".</p> <p>Mr Powell said the evidence corroborated the specific intent of perpetrators to destroy a \"group in whole or part\".</p> <p>Mr Powell said: \"There is nobody prepared to send troops in there from the United States or the European Union or elsewhere to put it down in the sense of an imposition force.\"</p> <p>The preferred option in Washington and London is to expand an African Union monitoring force already in Darfur.</p> <p>The state department report, released yesterday, said there was a \"consistent and widespread pattern of atrocities committed against non-Arab villagers\".</p> <p>The report said: \"Most respondents said government forces, militia fighters, or a combination of both, had completely destroyed their villages.\"</p> <p>It said 61% witnessed the killing of a family member, and 16% said they had been raped or had heard about a rape victim.</p> <p>The Sudanese government claims it is simplistic to portray the violence as between Arab Janjaweed and black African villagers, and blames much of the trouble on anti-government rebels in Darfur.</p> <p>The UN security council is discussing a draft resolution on Darfur calling for an expanded African Union mandate.</p> <p>The US and British governments will include in the draft the setting up of the international commission.</p>",
  "Changes later this year in gambling legislation - and the temptations of technology - could more than double the number of adult and adolescent Britons with gambling addiction, it was claimed. <p>\"We are just about to go through one of the biggest deregulation measures this country has ever seen,\" Mark Griffiths, who heads a gaming research unit at Nottingham Trent University, told the British Association science festival in Exeter. </p> <p>\"We are going to have more opportunities and access to gamble than ever before. The government have still allowed a loophole in the new legislation to gamble. And one of the things I argue is that all slot machines, regardless of type, are potentially addictive.\" </p> <p>The new legislation would allow \"low stake, low jackpot\" machines for children in sea side arcades and leisure centres. These were still addictive. </p> <p>He said he had called on Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary, and warned her that machines with a \u00a35 or \u00a310 jackpot were just as addictive as events with a \u00a31m jackpot. </p> <p>\"If you give little rewards every so often, it hooks people in,\" Professor Griffiths said. \"The second thing is the government is introducing unlimited jackpot prize machines. You are going to get a new breed of gambler who wants to play on high jackpot machines. These are potentially more addictive than low jackpot machines, because people will continually chase losses.\" </p> <p>Research suggested that there could be as many as 325,000 problem gamblers in the UK, he said. There might be twice as many adolescent gamblers with a problem. </p> <p>New legislation and new technological temptations, he added, could increase these figures by two to fourfold. </p> <p>The gambling industry deliberately manipulated the environment to keep punters longer at the casino or the slot machine. \"For instance, on a slot machine, we know you can gamble 12 times a minute. Addictions revolve primarily around rewards. So event frequency is very important.\" </p> <p>He had recorded heart rates as punters played slot machines. They got excited when they won, but also when they nearly won. </p> <p>\"Why do people gamble, despite constantly losing? They are not constantly losing, they are constantly nearly winning. Things like scratch cards are designed to give near miss experiences, and slot machines are designed to give lots of near miss experiences.\"</p>",

  "<p>A real Champions League-style clash is coming this winter as Eidos pitches its <a href=\"http://www.championshipmanager.co.uk\">Championship Manager 5</a> footie management sim against Sports Interactive's <a href=\"http://www.footballmanager.net\">Football Manager 2005</a>. For those unaware of the political intrigue here, <a href=\"http://www.sigames.com\">Sports Interactive</a> created Championship Manager back in the early nineties and developed the series right up until the recent CM4 Season 03/04, with Eidos as publisher. However, the two companies split up earlier this year and Eidos retained the Champ Man brand, handing over development duties to a new internal team. SI meanwhile, purchased a classic license \u2013 Football Manager \u2013 and set about building a new game around its award-winning footie database, game code and engine.</p> <p>Well, I don't know about CM5 yet, but I've been playing the Football Manager beta demo all week, and I think it's going to be a truly astonishing game\u2026</p> <p> </p> <p>Okay, so I have to come clean here. I can't really claim to be entirely objective. I edit The Official Football Manager magazine for Future publishing \u2013 a mag dedicated to Sports Interactive's games. However, I took that job because I loved the Championship Manager series. It has stolen countless hours of my life and is responsible for some of my fondest gaming memories. I know enough about it to appear on the recently dumbed-down Mastermind among other chumps answering questions on EastEnders and Star Wars figures. So I think I can speak with some authority when I say that Football Manager 2005, looks set to be a stunning example of its faintly maligned genre. Perhaps the pinnacle achievement so far.</p> <p>Just surfing around the excellent new menu system, checking out the vast player database (over 200,000 professionals, each digitally reconstructed with over 40 stats) and tinkering with the complex tactics screen has got those twangs of addiction reappearing. There are now over 50 countries to manage in and 2351 teams to control. All of the English sides have full youth and reserve teams (so have many of the major European sides), so you can judge immediately how your team is going to grow and develop over the next few years. It's nothing short of a football stat treasure trove. No wonder real managers are already approaching SI about getting access to this information base.</p> <p>There are some really interesting new gameplay features in here, too. The manager mind games element looks like it might be immense fun. You can select any other manager in the FM world and release a comment to the media about him, choosing from a vast selection that let you criticise his team's recent performances, boast about your chances when your sides meet on Saturday, or even declare your admiration for him. It's all part of the psy-ops that dominates real football, and could really humanise the whole experience (even if, currently, I have no idea how it affects things on the pitch \u2013 although SI assure me it does).</p> <p>With team tactics, you have truly deep and thorough control over how your side performs on the pitch. FM features slider bar controls for elements such as width, defensive line, creative freedom, etc, so you can intricately set-up your side, to either sit back and defend with a Rorke's Drift mentality, or charge up the field like maniacs, each member of the squad concentrating only on his own creative abilities. Most likely, you'll end up somewhere in between \u2013 it is up to each and every player to decide exactly where. I like the way its also possible to quickly change your tactics with a single button press. If you're desperate for a goal in the dying minutes, you can go to your tactics screen and click on a button that makes all your players hoof every last desperate pass up to your lofty danger man, for that classic route one finish.</p> <p>Navigation has clearly been influenced both by Mac Os X and the latest website design theory. There are multiple ways to get around, using the main menu bar along the top, a tree-style menu on the left, and a 'bread crumbs' menu on the bottom of the screen (which traces your route to the screen you're currently on so you can easily backtrack through the game) \u2013 all of which interact and feed off each other. It'll take hours to find your own way, but when you do it should become second nature \u2013 unlike the way you had to grapple with the interface in CM3, fighting your way through illogical menu screens. The aim with the entire design is to give you as easy access as possible to the increased complexity and sheer range of gameplay components. Transfers, loans, training \u2013 all are logically presented and packed with options.</p> <p>And, most importantly, it all looks like its leading to a realistic simulation of the sport itself. As Manchester City, I had a brilliant pre-season, firing in goals for fun, watching little Shaun racing along that right wing feeding Anelka with pin-point passes. But now, in the premiership, City are mis-firing, mistakes are occurring; watching the 2D match engine, I can see that gaps the size of small oceans are appearing between my stumbling back four. It's time to bring in support, time to hit that database, send out my scouts (who now act intelligently, checking out other players in the games they watch \u2013 not only the type you've asked them to study). It's time to bash out a few complex contracts, making the most of my meagre resources with sweeteners, bonuses and salary deals.</p> <p>The AI-controlled Assistant Manager is there to let you know who's not pulling their weight in the current squad, who needs to be placed on extra fitness training with your toughest coach. He'll also pick your team if you ask him to, and let you know about any new stars rising through the youth and reserve ranks. I am told your trusted right-hand man may also keep you up to date on dressing room gossip \u2013 the inter-player muck-spreading that no gaffer is directly privy to. SI says that player personalities will play a bigger role than ever. It will be easy to upset the moodier members of your first XI by criticising team performances to the press, or selling one of their mates. I'm not sure if there's a, 'refuse to speak to media after important international win' option, though.</p> <p>Football, increasingly, is a sport about personality and psychology, ego and expectation \u2013 games are won and lost in press conferences and on the back pages of the red tops. From my eight or so hours with this beta code, it seems SI has really caught the essence of this modern malaise \u2013 without sacrificing the purists' love of the tactical game.</p> <p>So yes, I am biased. But I feel \u2013 if the game speed is kept up to scratch (it seems much faster than CM4 in this demo), and the initial release is as bug free as possible - that this is going to be the greatest management game Sports Interactive has ever written. I think maybe my social life is over.</p>",
  "<p>The former head of factual programming at Carlton TV and executive producer of Littlejohn's Sky TV show is to spearhead the launch of al-Jazeera's international English-language news channel. </p> <p>Steve Clarke is the second senior executive to be appointed to the channel, which is planning to launch next autumn with a budget of more than \u00a325m a year.</p> <p>Paul Gibbs, a former BBC news and current affairs executive and the man who \"discovered\" Adrian Chiles, the radio and TV presenter, has also joined the channel, which has just begun recruiting staff in the UK.</p> <p>It is also understood that al-Jazeera tried to poach Steve Anderson, ITV's recently departed head of current affairs, to launch the channel but he declined for family reasons.</p> <p>Clarke, who will work in the al-Jazeera offices in Qatar, will work to Nigel Parsons, the former APTV boss who has been recruited as project leader. </p> <p>The station is planning to recruit around 200 staff and is just putting its top team in place, with a head of finance and a head of technology also on board.</p> <p>Clarke and Gibbs, who spent 19 years at the BBC, say they have been given free rein by the Qatari owners, who are determined to take on CNN and BBC World with a global service. </p> <p>The new station will not be an English-language version of the Arabic station that has caused so much controversy and which has been denounced and bombed by the US in the Afghan and Iraqi wars and which was this week evicted from Iraq by the prime minister.</p> <p>\"It really is a bona fide news channel in English. We will have four major news hubs - one in Asia - possibly Hong Kong, one in Doha, one in London and one in Washington, and our intention is that we will broadcast from these sites for several hours a day each,\" said Clarke.</p> <p>Clarke, who used to run the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation station which has now morphed into al-Jazeera's main rival, al-Arabiya, says that while it will rely heavily on al-Jazeera for Middle East reporting, it will have a different sensibility.</p> <p>One area in which it will differ is the controversial screening of graphic images of war.</p> <p>\"In my time at MBC, I remember looking at pictures coming in from a cameraman shooting in a morgue and lifting children's bodies from the slabs to see where the bodies had been shot and I thought 'oh, my God, what's going on here'.</p> <p>\"In the Arab culture they have a completely different concept of death. But as an English-language news channel we won't really be showing the warts-and-all pictures that are common on Arab news channels.\"</p> <p>The launch of al-Jazeera International with the backing of the Emir of Qatar's personal fortune is expected to attract huge attention because of the history of its parent operation.</p> <p>No other channel in the region has established such a reputation in such a short period of time, and during the Iraqi war it regularly scooped its western rivals, challenging military propaganda because it had established a network of camera crews in areas where coalition forces were bombing before the war had started.</p> <p>Gibbs, who is head of external programming, said he hoped the channel would be able to achieve what BBC World has failed to do because of lack of funding. </p> <p>\"We will have the same editorial ethic as BBC World but from a non-western base,\" he said, adding that it wanted to tap into the Muslim market not yet served by al-Jazeera.</p> <p>\"There are millions of non-Arabic speaking Muslims who want to know what all the fuss is about. There are swathes of people across the subcontinent of Asia who only get CNN or BBC and who don't have much empathy for CNN's agenda. The BBC would like to get to them but it doesn't have the money.\"</p> <p>Gibbs, who launched Adrian Chiles' Working Lunch series 10 years ago and who used to work on BBC1's Watchdog until he was sacked by Anne Robinson, said his ambition was to launch a global consumer show.</p> <p>The launch of the English-language channel is part of a wider plan for expansion. The network is hoping to do what Sky did for British broadcasting with the launch of an Arabic children's channel and sports and documentary channel. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>State of Play star John Simm and League of Gentlemen actor and comedian Mark Gatiss are being lined up for an ambitious new BBC3 comedy drama set in Blackpool.</p> <p>Funland centres on a fictional family with crime connections and fingers in lots of pies in Blackpool's leisure and entertainment industry.</p> <p>The show is the brainchild of League of Gentlemen co-creator Jeremy Dyson and EastEnders writer Simon Ashdown, and is an attempt to produce a long-running, returnable series in the style of US dramas such as The Sopranos, according to the BBC's comedy editor, Kenton Allen.</p> <p>Mr Allen is talking to Simm and Gatiss about taking two of the central roles in Funland, which will have a large ensemble cast with around a dozen main characters.</p> <p>Funland is a comedy drama, but will also have a strong thriller element, according to Mr Allen.</p> <p>\"One key part of the show is this family with gangsterish overtones. The backdrop is the new Blackpool, with its stag and hen parties. But there's also a thriller element, with one storyline being about a man who arrives in town on a quest, in search of something,\" he added.</p> <p>\"With Funland, our ambition is to create a long-running show with multiple storylines and a rolling narrative, like US series such as The Sopranos or Twin Peaks. It's a big sprawling piece, not a sitcom with just four main characters,\" Mr Allen said.</p> <p>Dyson and Ashdown have already written the script for the 60-minute first instalment of Funland, and BBC3 controller Stuart Murphy has ordered a further 10 30-minute episodes.</p> <p>\"We have very high hopes for Funland. It feels daring, smart and complex, as well as being very funny. It should add a more complex flavour to the BBC3 comedy repertoire,\" Mr Murphy said.</p> <p>Funland is due to go into production in March next year and is expected to be broadcast on BBC3 later in 2005. The show is also likely to be repeated on BBC2.</p> <p>The comedy drama has been developed Gabbie Asher and will be made by the BBC's Manchester comedy unit, which was set up by Mr Allen last year.</p> <p>A series producer and director are yet to be found for Funland, which is to be executive produced by Mr Allen.</p> <p>The BBC's Manchester comedy unit has already produced Johnny Vegas comedy I-Deal, which is to be broadcast on BBC3 next year.</p> <p>It will also be shooting a pilot next month in Manchester for another BBC3 show, 10:96, which has been scripted by comedy unit bursary winner Tony Burgess.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Di-di-di-di dah-dah, di-di-di-di daaaah. Di-di-di-di dah dah, di-di-di-di daaaah! <p>It's the most recognised TV theme song, and now it'll get stuck in your head all over again. The 70s cop show Hawaii Five-O is to be turned into a movie. </p> <p>Named thus because Hawaii is the 50th American state, the series featured breathtaking scenery matched with sharp dialogue, and was one of the most popular TV shows of all time. It ran from 1968 to 1980, and was the longest US police show until overtaken recently by Law and Order. </p> <p>After years of negotiations with various Hollywood studios, George Litto (who was the agent of the series' creator, the late Leonard Freeman) has sold the rights to Warner Brothers. The script will be written by the Ocean's 11 screenwriter George Nolfiset, and Litto will be the producer. </p> <p>Hawaii Five-O was an elite branch of the Hawaii state police answerable only to the governor. It was led by Steve McGarrett, played by Jack Lord, who finished every episode by chiming \"Book 'em, Danno\" to his sidekick Danny. Five-O investigated \"organised crime, murder, assassination attempts, foreign agents, felonies of every type\" and pursued the Chinese kingpin Wo Fat, who will feature heavily in the film. </p> <p>Yesterday, the movie trade magazine Variety reported how Litto had finally accepted an offer. He said: \"Name a company or a studio, and I can say they tried hard to make a deal, probably more than once. But Warners is the right place for this.\" </p> <p>In a previous interview, Litto said he fancied Mel Gibson, Harrison Ford or Michael Douglas as McGarrett. </p> <p>Variety said: \"Several studios tried over the years to catch the wave with seven-figure offers, but Litto held out for a pact that gave him and Freeman's estate creative input. He set a timetable on sequels and ensured that his family would be involved even after he dies, much the way the Broccoli clan has steered the James Bond franchise since the death of producer Cubby Broccoli.\" </p> <p>Hawaii Five-O joins a number of other 70s shows being looked at by studios, reaffirming our love for wide lapels, bad haircuts and platform shoes: The Six Million Dollar Man, CHiPs, the Dukes of Hazzard, and Kojak. Last March, Warner Brothers released a movie of Starsky and Hutch following remakes of Charlie's Angels and Mission: Impossible.

  "<p>Hurricane Ivan was heading towards Jamaica last night after devastating Grenada with 160mph winds, leaving at least 23 people dead in five countries and thousands of homes damaged or destroyed.</p> <p>The Jamaican prime minister, PJ Patterson, urged his people to pray. \"We have to prepare for the worst-case scenario. Let us pray for God's care,\" he said. \"This is a time that we must demonstrate that we are indeed our brother's and sister's keeper.\" </p> <p>Some 500,000 people - one in five Jamaicans - need to evacuate, said Barbara Carby, head of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management. </p> <p>The most dangerous storm to hit the Caribbean in years is projected to pass over Jamaica, Cuba and into the heart of the southern United States. </p> <p>Details of the death and destruction in Grenada are only emerging now because the storm cut all communications after hitting the island on Tuesday and Wednesday. </p> <p>\"We are terribly devastated, it's beyond imagination,\" said Grenada's prime minister, Keith Mitchell, from a Royal Navy warship helping with the rescue. </p> <p>The US declared Grenada a disaster area and released $50,000 (\u00a328,000) for emergency relief. \"This is just a jump start,\" said the US agency for international development. \"We'll send more.\" </p> <p>US officials told tourists and residents to leave the Florida Keys because Ivan could hit by Sunday; it is the third evacuation in a month after Hurricane Charley and Hurricane Frances. </p> <p>On Grenada, Royal Navy crews from two ships said yesterday that they had cleared the flooded airport outside the capital, St George's, and that emergency relief flights were starting to arrive. </p> <p>The Grenadian prime minister confirmed that the island's 17th century stone prison had been \"completely devastated\", allowing its inmates to escape, including leftwingers jailed for 20 years for killings in 1983 in an internal power struggle that led to an invasion by the United States. </p> <p>Mr Mitchell, whose home was flattened, said that nine-tenths of all houses were damaged and he feared the death toll would rise. He said much island agriculture had been destroyed, including the staple nutmeg crop. </p> <p>A UN spokesman estimated that virtually every major building in St George's had suffered damage, and said that it was sending a disaster team. </p> <p>\"It looks like a landslide happened,\" said Nicole Organ, 21, a student from Toronto at St George's University, which overlooks the capital. \"There are all these colours coming down the mountainside - sheets of metal, pieces of shacks.\" </p> <p>Students, mostly Americans, were arming themselves with knives, sticks and pepper spray against looters, said Sonya Lazarevic, 36, from New York City. Ms Organ said she saw bands of men carrying machetes looting a hardware store.

Trinidad and other Caribbean countries were sending troops, he added. </p> <p>The storm strengthened early yesterday to become a category five, on a scale of five.

Not even a category four storm had hit the Caribbean since Hurricane Luis in 1995. Hurricane Gilbert was only category three when it devastated Jamaica in 1988. </p> <p>The island has been on hurricane watch since Wednesday and has ordered schools closed and fishermen to pull their skiffs ashore. Haiti's south-west peninsula was also on hurricane watch; the city of Les Cayes suffered hours of downpours on Wednesday. </p> <p>Les Cayes residents worried that Ivan would bring disaster equal to the May floods that killed 1,700 people along the border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. </p> <p>Yesterday Ivan was centred 455 miles south-east of Kingston, Jamaica.

  "<b> I Gde Wiratha:</b> Owner of Paddy's Bar in Kuta, Bali, whose nightclub strip was bombed October 12 2002. Death toll: 202, mainly Australians, Indonesians <p><b>\u00b7</b> Of course I heard the bombs. I was at my hotel at the time, finishing a meeting with friends from Singapore. </p> <p>Three minutes later, my friend called my mobile. He'd just landed at the airport and said he'd seen a fireball in the sky. At the airport he'd heard it was Paddy's. So he called me. \"You've been bombed,\" he said. \"Stop pulling my leg,\" I said. Then every two minutes someone called me. They all mentioned the bomb. I realised then it must be true. </p> <p>After half an hour my brother called me. He said don't go anywhere, our place has been bombed. It was then that I got scared. My 10-year-old son and wife were afraid. So I didn't go anywhere. At 7.30am I got up and went there. There was blood everywhere. There were still bodies there. I almost fainted. </p> <p>I thought my staff must have been among the dead. I washed my head with drinking water. I was seeing stars. I didn't know what to think about the staff. They're like family to me. If one of them had died, it would have been like a part of me dying. </p> <p>It would have been much worse if God had not been protecting us. I believe 100% in my temple behind the bar. It was not damaged, including the umbrella in it. The generator next to it collapsed like a Coca-Cola can. And next to it were two [100-litre] tanks full of diesel. If those had exploded ... Oh my God, think what would have been the effect. But they didn't explode, even though the generator was destroyed. God was at work there. </p> <p>I then called all my staff who could still walk and asked them to gather at the hotel. I asked them how many people had died. Amazingly none of the staff had died. </p> <p>At 6pm the real flood of questioning started. Journalists, police, military. It went on for a month and a half. I'm now fed up with journalists because they asked me: \"Mr Gde: why was your place bombed? Why are all your staff still alive and so many guests dead?\" How can I explain? \"Was there no emergency door? Was there no security?\" </p> <p>I said how could you talk about security. At the World Trade Centre they had a lot of security but there could be an attack there. We have had bombs in Palestine, at the [Jakarta] Marriott hotel. We're just a bar in Bali. Could we protect ourselves more than them? </p> <p>But the hardest questions came from my son, Putu Kelvin. He asked: \"Why must we pay this? There are so many places, why us? Has daddy sinned?\" I can't give an answer to this question. \"Has daddy sinned so badly we had to be bombed?\" This is the question of a 10-year-old. \"Or has this happened because daddy is a thief, or corrupt?\" </p> <p>It was very hard to answer. I can't say this is political, or rational, or unilateral. He wouldn't understand. This was the hardest question I had to answer. He can see I work hard but he doesn't know why I was bombed. I can answer the journalists and the police, but not this. </p> <p>I don't want to blame someone. They're human beings. Only God can make a decision. If God doesn't agree, maybe it doesn't happen. Maybe it's also karma. Against me, against the Balinese. Against Indonesia. Against Asia. Who knows? They just used our place. So I think: right, this has happened. Let's forget it. Let's move on. We've got to lead our lives. </p> <p>We Balinese have a certain attitude to life. If someone harms me, I should not harm him back. If someone throws shit at me, I will throw back flowers. </p> <p>I was so proud when I discovered that the bombers were not Balinese. They can take our place but they cannot take away our soul. Bali is still paradise. It is still like before. </p> <p>It took me four months to decide to reopen. Kuta was quiet. Tourists couldn't go to the area, it was closed off. Business was dead for two and a half months. Many investigators came with so much equipment. </p> <p>Every time I went to the site the people would ask, \"Boss when are you going to reopen?\" The staff were just spending their time playing football and asking When? When boss? So I decided to reopen. </p> <p>According to the Balinese religion, anywhere that so many people die automatically becomes a cemetery. We cannot use the land. </p> <p>This [new Paddy's] used to be an open space used for parking. We moved slowly. I didn't have that much money. It was impossible to get credit. My wallet was almost empty because I had no guests but my costs were the same. Now the traffic jams are returning. It means the tourists are coming back. </p> <p>The Balinese say you don't have the same event twice. Or if you do, you are very stupid and deserve it. So the Balinese are really concerned that the security has to be intensified. Now we have volunteer guards from community groups everywhere. </p> <p>What happened is part of the story of life and you have to ensure it does not happen again. You must take care of yourselves, your family, your property and your community.<br> <b> John Aglionby </b> </p> <p><b> Jason Mosher:</b> A petty officer third class on the USS Cole when the warship was hit by explosives hidden in a small white fishing boat driven into its hull during a fuelling stop at Aden. October 12 2000. Death toll 17 servicemen </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I had just made a journal entry on my computer up in the radar room, and had come down into the mess line for lunch. Do you want to know what I wrote? I'll read it to you: \"Since the captain has decided that to tell anyone back home practically anything is some kind of violation of national security, it might be best to tell myself . . . Right now we are refuelling. There are a bunch of men on a little motorboat . . . One has a sweatshirt that says Free Kuwait (from the 1991 war) It's just kind of weird . . . We all kind of think of the whole area as enemy territory.\" </p> <p>I was just waiting in line when all of a sudden there was a bang. It sounded just like a really loud pop, and then everything was dark and quiet. Obviously, I knew something was very wrong right away, and I knew the ship had shaken. I couldn't feel it because it happened so fast but all of a sudden I was crouched. </p> <p>We fought flooding for another 36 hours before everything stabilised, and some spaces had to be sealed. We didn't have power for three days, not to the whole ship. I had to sleep outside for a few nights because we didn't have air conditioning. Having to get around a ship with a flashlight to take a shower in the dark - it was almost surreal. </p> <p>We felt extremely vulnerable, definitely vulnerable. After I did the muster, I went up to the weather deck and the gunners master was just handing out pistols. If you could hold a gun, you got one, and you pretty much stood around the perimeter of the ship, and if anything came within 500 yards you pointed at it. At one point there were a lot of people coming in our direction, and everyone just kneejerked and started aiming at them. We felt very, very vulnerable. We were over there, and it was Yemen. After that there were no friends there. When I went into town to give blood I was nervous. I was thinking any one of these people could be waiting to blow up this van with people in it to give blood. </p> <p>But I did get a chance to get down in the ship, and see the damage in the mess line where I had been. I saw the spot where I would have been standing if I had been on the other side of the ship. </p> <p>That it could even have happened! Even though we are in the navy, and it is the military and there is always the possibility of combat, there is still that element of invincibility - that it won't happen to me. It somehow never crossed my mind. It had never been done before, we had never heard of a boat pulling up to another point and exploding. There were no references. There was no idea that this could ever happen. </p> <p>I had never heard of al-Qaida before or Osama bin Laden or any of these people. If it's an explosion by a boat, it's obviously terrorism. It wasn't a blatant attack. It was someone who snuck up to the side of the ship and blew themselves up and who would use trickery like that? How can that be considered a legitimate attack by one nation against another? </p> <p>Obviously it was a precursor to September 11. </p> <p>Since that time in Aden I've come home to the US, doing a desk job before I'm discharged in 2006. I got married and I'm going to technical college. I want to work in biomedical engineering when I leave the navy. </p> <p>When I look around, it seems everywhere that groups are polarising. It seems to me like it is not just with Muslims and Christians, and Muslims and Jews, and Israelis and Palestinians. You are either one extreme or the other extreme. That just seems to be the way that everyone is going. I don't know how that happened, but that just seems to be what is going on. Maybe that is why we are seeing this kind of terrorism, and seeing this kind of conflict escalate and spread. This country [the US] was founded by people who were God-fearing men. They were Christians. They wrote the Constitution, wrote on principles that they had because they were upstanding men and Christian men. Extremists are the people like Hamas. Groups like that, they will never like America because they are Islamic and some sects of Islam are just completely hateful towards Christianity. Christian people over there are killed daily, there are some Islamic groups that seek out churches just because people believe in Jesus and they slaughter them just because of their faith. That is what happens, and that is what the extremist factions want. If they met a Christian, they would put him to the sword, so to speak, and no questions asked. </p> <p>There will always be someone else I think. It is just a sign of the times and the way the world is going to be. I don't see an end. I don't think it's ever going to end. <br> <b> Suzanne Goldenberg</b> </p> <p> <b> Canon Ian Sherwood:</b> Chaplain to the British Consul General in Istanbul. The consulate and the local HSBC bank headquarters were bombed on November 20 2003. Combined death toll: 30, mainly Turkish </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I had actually been due at the consulate that morning, at the very building that was blown up. I was supposed to go around 10am but remembered there was paperwork I needed to do urgently and decided to go the following day. </p> <p>The blast was at around 11am. I was in my office at my desk when I heard it. We have a lot of refugees in the church, and the first thing I did was to check on the children. </p> <p>I had no idea the consulate had been the target but as I walked [towards it] and looked down I realised that the two gate lodges that were used as offices were completely gone ... only two nights before the Archbishop of Canterbury was here and we had dinner there with Roger [Short, the British consul]. </p> <p>I walked right round the circumference of the neighbourhood and realised that lots of people must have been dead. And then, it seemed, the whole world was on the telephone as people in Britain began ringing in, asking about loved ones. </p> <p>There were certain pastoral things I had to do like seeing those who were bereaved. </p> <p>It was terribly numbing partly because I felt very alone trying to cope with what had to be done. As there had been another bomb attack a few days before [on November 15 two synagogues were targeted by suicide bombers], we all wondered when the next one would be. </p> <p>Time moved on. We held a requiem, a very beautiful service with about a thousand people, less than a month later and that meant we were able to celebrate Christmas, put the bombing aside. </p> <p>But every morning I weep when I think about it, even now. Not just for the people who died here, but for all those who have been slaughtered by al-Qaida over the past 20 years. </p> <p>It [the attack] brought greater sympathy and understanding of how truly shocking this Islamicist terrorism is. I think the bombing in Istanbul brought home to us the suffering of normal Muslims because it is they who suffer the most from this. </p> <p>Suddenly we were drawn into this terrible drama that so many have had to suffer all over the place, not just in Afghanistan or Iraq but countries in Africa and across the Middle East. </p> <p>The bombing drew us together in a way that these things can do. Victoria Short [widow of the slain consul] kept open-house for 10 days afterwards and was of immense service to the British community here. </p> <p>Life has gone on but we still carry this feeling of bereavement and it's not going to disappear. The carnage and the awfulness of it continues to reveal itself. You hear of terrible stories in the neighbourhood around the consulate, like the dusty thing on someone's balcony turning out to be a human kidney or the object in a pipe turning out to be a human hand. </p> <p>I'm very interested in the rise of Islamicism and I did wonder at what stage our community would have to face it. For years and years I've talked about it. All through [President] Clinton's administration I was astonished at how Osama bin Laden was allowed to continue like this and not be brought to justice. </p> <p>I am interested in the man's spirituality, how it was forged into a major terrorist movement. Islam is a wonderful, interesting, romantic subject . . . but you can see, if you know anything about the Koran, how it has always got this potential [for violence]. It's a bit like if we just read the Old Testament we could always be thinking about Holy wars. But there is more to civilisation than that. </p> <p>There is the redemption of civilisation . . . that forgiveness and redemption is at the heart of what we all stand for, whether we are liberals or conservatives. It is such a stark contrast to the idea that you wish to obliterate all your enemies, turn them into Muslims and take over their societies. In that sense this [terror campaign] is a third Jihad, one that threatens our culture and our society. </p> <p>People seem not to like this but I feel it has to be said that the problem is that not enough Muslims speak out in horror of what al-Qaida is doing and I am talking about decent, normal British citizens, Turkish citizens. </p> <p>Now of course we don't associate good, decent Muslims with al-Qaida, it's very important to say that, but it is rather intriguing that there is very little that has been said in shock and horror at the loss of loved Turkish and British friends here. </p> <p>Those who represent Islam have not been very outspoken in condemning carnage, diabolical carnage . . . Why are good, decent Muslims not speaking out? Are they frightened? Do they sympathise? No, of course they don't sympathise, so why are they so silent? </p> <p>Another thing that bothers me is why is it that religions other than Islam are constantly made to feel diminished in the Islamic world? </p> <p>Why is it that we are made to feel that we misunderstand Islam, when Islam in our own free societies makes no effort to stand up for us Christians in Islamic societies? </p> <p>There are certain countries that have the potential to lead the way. Turkey is desperate to be part of the European Union, it has a peaceful, democratic Islamic government. We [the British community] love Turkey, and that's why we ask, ought it not be time for this part of the Islamic world to sit up and address the shocking diminishment of all other religions in its domain? </p> <p>Unfortunately the west has turned in on itself. Europe has turned against America, the democrats in the United States have turned against America . . . it is the innocent people and not the guilty people who are being blamed. The guilty people are the bombers, are al-Qaida, they are the people who did this.\" <br> <b> Helena Smith</b></p>",
  "<b> George Mimba:</b> IT manager at US embassy, Nairobi, and survivor of the August 7 1998 bombing there. Death toll: 213 people, all but a dozen of them Kenyans and other non-Americans. A synchronised attack in Dar es Salaam killed 11 Tanzanians <p><b>\u00b7</b> My boss reminded me that I needed to go to the embassy cashier to pick up my allowance - I was supposed to travel to Accra, in Ghana, for a conference for American embassy computer managers in Africa. </p> <p>I walked to the cashier's office. It was a Friday, and on Friday the Americans go on safari, so they were queueing up for money. Kenyans were queueing up for money as well. </p> <p>The lady who was banking the money spotted me. Her name was Lucy. She said to jump the queue. I got the money and went back to my office. All those people I left in the queue died, including the cashier. </p> <p>I was sending my last email when I heard the first explosion. It came in like a tremor: \"Der-der-der-der-der.\" </p> <p>People were rushing to the window, but I thought I would send the email before I went to look. Then I left my office, heading for the open space, and I was just by a pillar next to the computer room when the killer explosion came, and that's when my life changed. </p> <p>[George was knocked unconscious but not badly injured. When he came round, he managed to crawl out of the building to safety.] </p> <p>As I was crawling I could feel bodies, and I remember one of these was a very good friend, a colleague, we used to go out every Friday. I reached out for him and held him like this [cradling his arms]. But I was holding just a head. This was a head that was making noise. The rest of the body was not there. </p> <p>I felt like it was not real. When you were in that building you were made to believe that it was the safest place. The Kenyans working there felt this was an embassy - nothing could happen to you while you were inside. </p> <p>I was shaken, and I was so angry at what I had been made to believe. I was angry at myself. I didn't want to be alive because I thought that the people who died would be more peaceful than people like us. </p> <p>I thought that if I was alive, I must be fractured all over, and I did not want to remain in that pain. Also, I did not know what I had done wrong, what we had done wrong, that would make somebody do such a thing to us. </p> <p>And I thought somebody would warn us. We went through bomb drills, fire drills, but when the real thing happened, everyone was taken by surprise, including the Marine guards who were on duty. </p> <p>We were so naive. We didn't know how to react. The colleagues who died, the majority of them were the ones who went to the window to see what was happening. I was also going towards the window. </p> <p>The killer explosion came when everybody was at the window. </p> <p>What happened changed my life totally. When I leave home, I leave home knowing that I might not see tomorrow, as long as I work in the American embassy. </p> <p>We had something on Fridays called \"TGIF\" - Thank God It's Friday. We all used to go out and have fun with other colleagues at the embassy. One of them was this guy whose head was separated from his body. This guy had had things planned and then he was no more. </p> <p>I'm more afraid, as a person. I'm not afraid to die. But maybe when some wind closes the door, and I hear a small bang, I get scared. </p> <p>I tend to go out of Nairobi more. I go to see my parents in the countryside, where it's quiet and peaceful and there's nobody who can harm you. </p> <p>I still work at the embassy, as regional information systems manager. My family have asked me to quit the job, but somehow I've realised there's no safe place. </p> <p>And the thing I like about the embassy is that we keep changing our systems every year - there's no company in Nairobi that can afford to do that - so we keep getting new things. </p> <p>I feel more religious. When I survived, I asked myself why I survived, at each and every stage - like leaving the cashier's office early. </p> <p>I started asking myself: \"Why did I get out? what's special in me?\" Since then, I have been taking Christianity very seriously. </p> <p>I have two boys. One was born after the bomb, George jr. Every step I make now is towards them, because I know that I can go at any time. I had to redo my will. I had to start saving heavily. Every property I have now is in their name, so if something happens they will be safe. </p> <p>I wanted to find out exactly what would make somebody hate a person, like what had happened. Why would somebody just kill? </p> <p>Then I went to New York, where I testified during the trial of the people who bombed the embassy. </p> <p>[In May 2001, two men were convicted of murder in connection with the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Two others were found guilty of taking part in the conspiracy.] </p> <p>In New York, we stayed at a hotel in the World Trade Centre. Immediately after we came home, this building also was destroyed. </p> <p>I wish I could talk to one of them [the bombers]. When I was in court, I really wanted to. How they behaved in court made me more angry. There were four of them, sitting [facing], just like you and me. </p> <p>They looked at us, and they made faces, they grinned. It was like, whatever they did, they didn't feel anything whatsoever. You wonder if they have any feelings at all. </p> <p>I used to love action films, Sylvester Stallone, but what happened made me feel that whatever is happening out there is real. </p> <p>It reminds me of what I saw. The real blood, and people cut into pieces. </p> <p>Now I only watch movies based on true stories, and comedies. <br> <b> Jeevan Vasagar </b> </p> <p><b> Zainab Abbas:</b> Mother of Hashim Abbas, hotel employee killed in a car bomb at the Sheraton in Karachi, Pakistan, May 8 2002. Death toll: 14 men, including two Pakistani naval officers, 11 French engineers on a bus </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Hashim was my first-born. He was in the hotel's housekeeping department. His age was 27. He was the only one working to support the family at that time, because his father was unwell. Sikander, my second son, was going to school then because Hashim refused to let him work. He said: \"Let me be the worker, and let him study. He is a good boy; let him finish his education.\" This was typical of Hashim, he was very generous and very responsible. After he was killed, Sikander had to leave school to take a job in the hotel, but he earns only half as much as Hashim earned and he doesn't get any tips. My husband also died shortly after Hashim. He had been an invalid for many years, but he became much weaker after Hashim died. I am sure the shock of losing Hashim broke both of our hearts. </p> <p>The morning my son was killed, he arose early to go to the hotel. I said to him, \"Don't go anywhere today, relax, you are on holiday,\" But, Hashim said, \"No, I have some wages to collect, so I must go.\" The next thing, we saw on the news that there had been a bomb at the hotel, and immediately I rushed there to see what had happened to my son. Outside the hotel, there was a big crowd, but when I told the guards that I was the mother of Hashim, they let me pass through. It was a terrible scene. There was glass and wreckage all over the road and the hotel looked as if it had been on fire. Then they took me to the hotel manager, and he said, \"Don't worry Hashim is fine, he is injured, but he is alive.\" But I sensed that something was wrong, and I lay down on the hotel floor and wailed out of terror for my son. </p> <p>The hotel people brought me home and told me to wait for news of Hashim, and again they said that he was fine. So then I sent my son-in-law to the hospital to find out what had happened to my son, and he returned two hours later with his body. We don't know whether Hashim died immediately, but I suppose that he did, thank God, because his legs had been blown away and his head and chest were badly damaged. </p> <p>Who can say why someone would want to do such a terrible thing to innocent people. Only the criminals themselves can know. But I am not interested in why they wanted to kill, because Hashim was not the target of this bomb, the foreigners were the targets. I am not interested in politics of this kind, nobody cares about these things, they are for politicians and criminals. Honest, hard-working people with families to feed do not think about these things. Only sometimes I have thought about the mothers of the Frenchmen who died with my son. They must have suffered as I suffer because mothers are the same all over the world, and only those who have suffered this grief know what it is to lose your son. </p> <p>Since Hashim died I have looked on the world with sorrowful eyes. I used to be a very happy woman; but now I am terrified all the time. I have changed so much. I see the bad in everything. Only the bad. In the weeks after Hashim was killed, perhaps I was a little mad. I was terrified that Sikander would also be killed, and when he started working at the hotel I used to follow him there, and sit outside the main door, waiting for him to finish his work. All day I used to sit outside in the sun, until one day the hotel manager came to me and said, \"Auntie, enough, you cannot sit there all day.\" And then he installed a telephone in my house so that I could call Sikander at his work and know that he is safe. </p> <p>Sikander tells me I should relax. In fact, many people say that Karachi is safer now than it was 10 years ago, when we had a lot of crimes and shooting. But I cannot speak of these things, because I never thought about danger until Hashim was killed. Now, I am always going to visit Hashim's grave, to pray for the soul of my eldest son, and that God will spare the life of my second son, Sikander. Four or five months ago, I had a terrible scare when some people fired on the American consulate, which is close to the hotel. I phoned the hotel, wailing and crying, asking them what had happened to Sikander, until they brought him to the phone and told me to be calm. </p> <p>I feel such hatred towards the men who killed my son. What made them commit this evil act? It was an act of savagery. Imagine! They chose to kill men who were working hard to support their families, men like my son, men like these French people. These killers must all be executed. But, God willing, even if they are not made to suffer now, they will suffer on the Day of Judgment. Murderers do not go to heaven; they go to hell. British and French people may not be Muslim, but they are still human, and all mankind was made by Allah. Anyone who kills Allah's children will go to hell. </p> <p>If you go to the hotel, you will see that they have put up a picture of Hashim in the reception, which was a good thing. My son was a good worker and he was well-respected. He never caused anyone any trouble. I am happy that the hotel has honoured him. But the government has never done anything. They have given us no compensation for my son's death, and not even one government official has come here to offer his condolences. Of course they were very nervous about the foreigners being killed in Pakistan and also the naval officers because they were powerful men. But, no, they do not care at all about Hashim. He was not involved in their politics. But because of his death many people have suffered. <br> <b> James Astill</b> </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Rick King:</b> Owner of a general store and assistant fire chief, Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Here, one of the four US aeroplanes hijacked on September 11 2001 - United Airlines flight 93 from Newark to San Francisco - crashed. Death toll: 44, including four hijackers. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I was talking on the phone to my sister Jody about the twin towers and the Pentagon being hit, when she said: \"Rick I hear a plane ... Rick it's loud and low and it sounds like a jet.\" </p> <p>I ran outside and immediately I could hear the engines and the roaring, but I never saw it. And then it hit. I saw this huge fireball going up in the sky and then a mushroom cloud. It shook the whole town. I said, \"Jody I got to go.\" </p> <p>So my first thought was, \"What the hell is going on? Planes are just falling out of the sky.\" But my second was the panic of wondering what was going to happen now. We don't train for commercial airline crashes in Shanksville. With a volunteer force you have to go with who is available and since it happened on a weekday there were four people here - the rest were at work. We just followed the smoke. </p> <p>I remember getting out of the fire engine and thinking where is it? There were no wings, no tail section, no nose. Nothing that looked like a plane. Just small balls of metal you could fit in your hand, pieces of wiring, insulation and mail. Some trees were smouldering and I started to hope that maybe it was a courier plane rather than a passenger jet. Then I started walking down this trail of singed wooded area and saw a piece of charred human flesh. Then I started to see more of that and more metal. </p> <p>By the time I came back the FBI and the Pennsylvania state police were there and they took over. It was a crime scene so they had to stop people walking around. They told us first that there were 45 passengers on board, although it later changed to 44. That's when we knew what we were dealing with. It was good to see them take charge. </p> <p>That day has changed my life. I don't know exactly how yet. I still raise my family in the same way. But another second and it would have landed on our town. It makes you look at life and appreciate it more. I've met the president, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. I sat in the first lady's box at the Kennedy Centre. </p> <p>On the other hand, it makes you angry that there are people in the world who hate us so much that they would want to kill innocent civilians. I worry about our country but I don't worry on a daily basis about anything like that happening again around here. I know Shanksville wasn't the target that day. </p> <p>The town hasn't changed much in many ways. But there is an impact that a huge event like that will have on a small community like this. New York is New York - it's a big city and it'll get through it. But Shanksville? There's more traffic with people coming to look at the site and visitors we never used to have, but nobody's putting locks on their doors. </p> <p>But you won't find anyone around here trying to cash in on it. It's still a great place to raise children. We don't have any crime or a huge drug problem. There are 247 people in this town and four churches so that should tell you something. </p> <p>We got to know all of the victims' families, some of them on a very personal basis. But it's an awesome responsibility for a small town. Politically not much has changed. I supported Bush from the beginning and for the most part the country is behind him. I don't like the fact that some believe this war in Iraq is the US against the Muslims. It's not that. We are the most giving nation in the world and we do more for the poor than anybody else. We're not a country that goes into other countries to attack them, but goes to war for the defence of others. I wish the rest of the world would see that. </p> <p>People do talk politics when they come into my store. We agree and disagree and put our two cents in. Some people think we're in a mess because of this war and others of us support it. I'd say there's definitely more of that kind of talk now. But then there wasn't a whole lot to talk about before.<br> <b> Gary Younge</b> </p> <p> </p>",
  "<p><strong>Fernandez Marino:</strong> Specialist in orthopaedic surgery and traumatology, on duty in the accident and emergency ward of Madrid's Gregorio Mara\u00f1on hospital on March 11 2004, when a dozen bombs exploded on commuter trains. Death toll: 191 people</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> What has stayed in my mind from that day is the noise of the ambulances. It was as if there was a giant wasps' nest of them out there in the street. That sound is something that has remained in my head. Thinking back, that was how, in the hospital, we first realised something truly serious was happening.</p> <p> The first ones to arrive weren't too badly injured. But I remember they were very traumatised, very frightened, most of them with burns and - something that made an impact on all of us - with their hair totally burned off. This sort of things leaves its mark. Emotionally, it is bound to have an effect. And no, it's not the same as all those other things I have seen as a doctor.</p> <p> I started in this hospital in 1984 and I have never seen anything like this. I have had to deal with several Eta bomb attacks. I remember a bomb in a bus full of civil guardsmen. There were lots of open fractures and amputations then too, but you can't compare one with the other.</p> <p> The others were terrible, but this was, I don't know how to say it ... The people who came into the hospital this time could not even speak. In the other terrorist attacks people were shocked but they were able to talk. These ones couldn't say anything at all. They were totally closed in on themselves. </p> <p>Many couldn't even hear you because their eardrums had been blown out. We really began to see just how extreme things had got when they started bringing us people on railway station benches. They must have run out of stretchers. Some of the injured came with legs already totally amputated. Others had them just barely hanging on. Those amputations had to be sorted out - and that meant cutting, cutting off more bone. One of the things that most had to be dealt with were people who had eyes blown out. That was another result of the shockwave.</p> <p> Adrenaline works, you know. The adrenaline charge keeps you going all through the day, but it leaves you wrecked the next day. You have to organise yourself psychologically, whatever way you can, to carry on. You could see some people, especially the younger doctors, were very badly affected by what was happening, and crying. Was I sadder because of it all? Well yes, I was sad, more serious, for a few days, but not enough to need any professional psychological help.</p> <p> A kind of sadness stays with you. But I think we did things well. The feeling is sweet and sour, of sadness and upset, but with pride at having tried to give your best, at being able to deal with a situation that I don't think anybody else in Europe has ever had to confront. I don't dwell on all of this, I don't worry about what might happen next. When I go to see my parents, I go on the metro. I'm not afraid. If something is going to happen, then it will happen - what can we do about it?</p> <p> The other day, I was talking to an uncle who lives in New York. He was on holiday on September 11 but worked in the World Trade Centre and was there the previous time they attacked it. He asked: \"Aren't you scared now to catch the metro? Aren't you scared of catching the bus?\" And I said: \"Well, if it has to happen, it will happen. There is no point fretting about it. What we are not going to do is mortgage our lives to this bunch of bastards.\" If you work out the possibilities of something happening, you realise is more dangerous to cross the street in front of the hospital. We can't let them hold our lives and our freedoms to ransom. <br> <strong>Giles Tremlett</strong></p> <p><strong>Taoufiq Moussaif: </strong> Defence lawyer, acting for some of the hundreds of Moroccan men charged in a crackdown after five Casablanca targets (some Jewish were bombed, May 16 2003. Death toll: 33 members of the public and 12 suicide bombers.</p> <p>I had about 30 clients among the hundreds charged following the Casablanca bombings, including the preacher Hassan Kettani, who has been sentenced to 20 years, and the preacher Mohammed Abdel Wahab Rafiqi, sentenced to 30 years. According to the court they were the agitators for the people responsible for the drama of May 16. And Hicham Saber [who replaced Kettani as preacher at Kettani's mosque near Rabat, after Kettani was banned], who was acquitted.</p> <p> One thing I want to say clearly: there was a kind of conspiracy among officials and lawyers' associations to make sure that those accused in connection with May 16 didn't have a lawyer with them when they came before the investigating magistrate. In most cases, when I came into contact with a client I was presented with a file already well sewn up. Well-rounded declarations, signed statements, very finely done so that no court could reject it.</p> <p> Ever since I began to represent clients in al- Qaida-related cases [in 2002] I have had a lot of obstacles placed in my way by officials. The police began to ask my clients' families lots of questions, about why they chose me as a lawyer, whether I had any connection with the Jihad Salafists [Islamist fringe].</p> <p> After the Casablanca explosions they contacted my father to say, \"Your son is causing us problems. He is in contact with the press and human rights groups.\" I come from a bourgeois family here in Rabat, wholesalers of autoparts, bicycle parts, metal components. People began to make problems for my relatives. In one ministry they said, \"Look, this contract we had with you, we're sorry but we can't go through with it.\"</p> <p> That was on May 26 [2003]. I remember because I was at the clinic where my wife had just had a baby. When these relatives of mine came to the clinic to see her, they said to me, \"Look what you've done to us now! We've had good relations with the government for decades. You've spoiled everything we built up over 50 years!\"</p> <p> Then in June a man came up to me as I was leaving my office. A man in his 60s. He said, \"I'm a friend of your father. I want to talk to you a little.\" (My father said later he knew this person vaguely from the past). So I got into his car.</p> <p> He said, \"Look, Morocco is now at a point where there are people who want to destabilise it. They want to attack the political system and destroy everything that is good about Morocco. We want everyone to fall into line against these terrorists, so I'm obliged to give you some advice. You must avoid the press and human rights organisations.\"</p> <p> At first I didn't take it seriously. I just said to him, \"Look, I'm a lawyer. I do my job as the law dictates. If you are bothered by one of my declarations, you should tell me. Then we can talk about it. I know the security people are doing a job also.\"</p> <p> Then he invited me three times to people's houses where there were university deans, highly placed people, people from political parties. We talked all evening sometimes. They asked me to help them with their investigation. I told them, \"That is your job, not mine.\" It's not my role. If you are a lawyer you have to stick to being a lawyer. I'm not crafty enough to work with those people.</p> <p> There is one thing I insist on. A person, whatever he may do, whether he's a terrorist or not, or a gentleman or a criminal or a crook, for me it's the same thing. I do my work. I'm a man of the law and I practise my trade within the law. Yes, I've become known as the Islamists' lawyer. But Islamists run into thousands, I only represented 30 or so. Other lawyers helped more than 50 of those held.</p> <p> In the weeks after the bombings they were talking about dissolving the PJD. [Moussaif is also a member of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), the only Islamists in the Moroccan parliament.] All Islamic organisations were under heavy surveillance. The PJD had no connection with those attacks - the PJD is for democracy, human rights, for stability. The party leadership decided I needed to get the goahead before taking on any client charged in connection with the bombings. </p> <p> Of course I didn't accept that. After the Casablanca bombings the big losers were human rights. In Morocco we're not living in the same atmosphere as before May 16. Now, no one can be sure of being left in peace, or that if he is taken to court he will get a fair trial. <br> <strong>Eileen Byrne</strong></p> <p> <strong>Nitza Rubabshi:</strong> An nursery teacher, aged 38, Nitza and her family were among a group of Israeli tourists at the Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, Kenya, when it was bombed, November 28 2002. Death toll: 15, most of them Kenyan We decided to go to Kenya because we were afraid of terror attacks here in Israel and we got a really good offer: \u00a3300 ($500) each for eight days. We thought it would be quiet and peaceful.</p> <p> At first my three daughters did not want to go, but we convinced them that they would love it. When we landed I was quite shocked. It was like Gaza. There were cars packed with people and barefoot children pushing trolleys. It was very third-world and I didn't expect that, I don't know why.</p> <p> At the hotel, it was beautiful. I began to think that we had made the right decision. But I didn't like the rooms so we came back to the lobby and our luggage was brought down as well to the centre of the lobby.</p> <p> Just as I began to explain to the Israeli holiday rep what was wrong with our rooms, the explosion went off.</p> <p> Ayelet, my daughter, was close to me and she was unharmed but then I saw my husband running around crying out the names of the other two. They had been standing next to the luggage which was now in flames.</p> <p> My only thought was then to find Rotem and Alona. I remember screaming, \"Oh why did we come here?\" I felt very guilty. For 20 minutes we didn't know whether they were alive or dead. We ran around shouting their names for what seemed like an eternity before heading towards the beach. We met them halfway. I was so relieved we all hugged and we didn't want to let go. There was no way we could continue our holiday after that so we were very relieved when someone from El Al security came to tell us that there was a plane coming to take us home.</p> <p> When we saw the Israeli aircraft at the airport we knew we were in safe hands. It was like being back in Israel. We went home in the prime minister's plane. I don't know if people from other countries were as well looked after.</p> <p> The best thing was coming back during the Hanukah holiday. All the family visited and that made life become normal very quickly. We all had trauma counselling after we came back.</p> <p> That helped us cope with our fears. Rotem has a fear of buses and will rarely go on them. But on the whole we decided that we will go on living. My husband now has a fear that when the whole family is together we are at risk and every time we see something on the news, a bombing here or the bombing in Madrid, all the memories come flooding back. I always remember the fear that my daughters were dead.</p> <p> There is nothing worse for any parent. We are all much more nervous. I go out but I always make sure there is a security guard at the restaurant. I get nervous in crowds. Since Kenya, we have been abroad. Everybody said that the best thing to do was to get straight on a plane. We know there is danger everywhere. We went to Ireland and my daughters have been to the United States and England. They have to phone home every day, which is something they would not have done in the past.</p> <p> We have managed to get by but the memory is always there.</p> <p> Just yesterday I was sitting on the balcony and I remembered the image of my husband crying after the explosion because he thought our two daughters were dead. <br> <strong>Conal Urquhart</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday August 12 2008.

  "Five pub companies yesterday announced smoking restrictions as part of a campaign to head off a total government-imposed ban. <p>By the end of next year drinkers will not be allowed to smoke at the bar of the 22,000 premises run by Mitchells &amp; Butlers, Scottish and Newcastle Pub Enterprises, the Spirit Group, the Punch Pub Company and Enterprise Inns. </p> <p>Within five years 80% of the trading space at those pubs and bars - which make up around a third of all premises in the UK - will be no-smoking areas. </p> <p>The anti-smoking campaign group Ash attacked the plans as inadequate, claiming it was impossible to separate smoking and non-smoking areas because smoke drifted. </p> <p>Ash expressed concern that if the move - which was welcomed by the government - staved off legislation it would be more difficult to frame legislation for other workplaces. </p> <p>Others within the hospitality industry were frustrated that the companies were going it alone when they were trying to hammer out a voluntary charter with the government. The pro-smoking group Forest called the moves \"over the top\". </p> <p>There has been concern among many pub companies that the government will ban smoking in enclosed public places. Most landlords prefer to offer customers a choice. </p> <p>In a statement the five companies said the programme would \"transform pubs into primarily no-smoking venues\". </p> <p>The chief executive of Mitchells &amp; Butlers, Tim Clarke, said: \"The policy is the result of careful consideration of the needs of both smokers and non-smokers and is the best way to provide choice for all our customers.\" </p> <p>But the companies conceded that the move was about profits, pointing out that the ban on smoking in pubs in Ireland had led to a 15% fall in trade. </p> <p>The issue is likely to form part of a white paper being drawn up by the Department of Health.</p>",
  "People with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders will be told during the next fortnight whether they have been exposed to a risk of infection from the human form of BSE through treatment with plasma and other blood products. <p>The government is refusing to say how many people will be notified by their doctors as officials seek to assess the threat posed by normal blood transfusions and other products, after strong circumstantial evidence that two people, one of whom died from vCJD, had been infected by contaminated blood. The second died from other causes, but had signs of vCJD, rogue prion proteins in the spleen. </p> <p>Sixteen people who received \"normal\" red blood transfusions using blood from people who subsequently died from vCJD were told of a risk months ago. But the policy about informing haemophiliacs whose plasma came from infected pools derived from thousands of people has been patchy. </p> <p>It remains unclear how many of the thousands of haemophiliacs might have received contaminated products. Doctors have been asked to check which of their patients had treatment from batches which included donations from people who later developed vCJD, and to tell those who did. </p> <p>John Reid, the health secretary, told MPs yesterday that the risk from plasma was uncertain, although he suggested it was lower than from whole blood transfusion, because of the dilution in pools. This is disputed by some haemophiliacs, many of whom are bitter at having been infected with HIV and hepatitis C through contamination. </p> <p>Carol Grayson, founder of Haemophilia Action UK, said that her husband, Peter Longstaff, had been exposed to contaminated products on 12 occasions after their appeals for him to be put on synthetic alternatives were rejected. </p> <p>She was glad the information would now be made available, but it was \"too little , too late\". There had been little or no support for haemophiliacs who were told they might have been put at risk, she said. </p> <p>Graham Steel, of the Human BSE Foundation, said that health authorities must investigate whether they needed to go further than removing white cells from blood, a process introduced in 1999, but which fails to remove all the risk from blood. Recent studies using animals had suggested infection in plasma and red blood cells. \"Further work must be carried out with urgency to find an accurate test for prion disease in blood.\" </p> <p>Until December last year, the government had always said that the risk of developing the long-incubating vCJD through blood was theoretical, despite scientists warning that the risk was \"appreciable\". The two cases since then have led ministers to accept a \"possible\" link. A host of precautionary measures to protect the blood supply have been taken. </p> <p>Britain exported blood products which might have been contaminated to 11 countries between 1996 and 2000.</p>",
  "Rank and file police officers in Northern Ireland last night passed a vote of no confidence in the chief constable, Hugh Orde, after he axed more than half the police reserve as part of the overhaul of the province's controversial force. <p>In response to recommendations by Chris Patten to reform the predominantly Protestant force, Mr Orde will cut reservists from just under 1,500 to 680. </p> <p>Unionist and nationalist reactions highlighted the difference of opinion that will need to be bridged at next week's talks at Leeds Castle in Kent aimed at restoring devolution to Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The Democratic Unionist Party said the cuts were \"a human and policing tragedy\" and that the republican threat to security remained significant. The Real IRA yesterday admitted carrying out a gun attack on construction workers at a police station in Derry earlier this week. </p> <p>Sinn Fein said the cuts were not enough. Assembly member Gerry Kelly said the plan amounted to retaining a \"sectarian, Unionist militia\". </p> <p>Alex Atwood of the SDLP said Northern Ireland already had two-and-a-half times more police proportionately than any other part of the UK and Ireland. </p> <p>Leaders of the Police Federation who passed the no confidence motion said morale had been damaged and Mr Orde had disregarded advice from senior officers.</p>",

  "<p>Separate reports into the abuses carried out by disgraced doctors Clifford Ayling and Richard Neale yesterday called for changes to medical protocol to ensure the safety of female patients. </p> <p>Clifford Ayling, a GP from Kent, was jailed for four years in 2000 after being convicted of 13 counts of indecent assault. Yesterday an independent report, chaired by Dame Anna Pauffley QC, expressed concern about the way the NHS had failed to stop Mr Ayling, despite nearly 20 years of complaints by patients and his dismissal by four Kent hospitals where he worked in obstetrics and gynaecology. </p> <p>It said nothing in the government's reform of the NHS was certain to protect patients from another doctor like Mr Ayling. </p> <p>\"We believe it is too early to conclude that should [patients] encounter another Ayling, particularly in the general practice setting, improved systems are yet fully developed which would enable their concerns to be heard and acted upon.\" </p> <p>The inquiry said the NHS must learn how to tackle reports of \"sexualised behaviour\" by doctors - the term it uses for Ayling's approach. </p> <p>It also called for the chief medical officer to develop guidance on dealing with \"sexualised behaviour\". </p> <p>Mr Neale, a gynaecologist from North Yorkshire, was banned from operating or treating patients in 2000 after being found guilty of 34 charges of botching women's care, leaving 15 patients in pain, incontinent or unable to bear children. </p> <p>The inquiry which looked at the handling of complaints against him said there were \"lamentable\" failings in dealing with patients' concerns regarding Mr Neale, a \"perplexing\" decision by the General Medical Council to allow him to practise in Britain after being struck off in Canada, and a long-winded and costly procedure that persuaded one hospital to strike a severance deal with him instead of seeking to discipline him. </p> <p>It also questioned whether patient advocacy services be ing introduced in hospitals would make any difference to managers' willingness to investigate complaints, suggesting that they would raise expectations among patients but fail to deliver satisfactory resolutions. </p> <p>Judge Suzan Matthews QC, who chaired the Neale inquiry, acknowledged change was being made in the NHS, but said more needed to be done. \"A sense of complacency undoubtedly contributed to what occurred. There is no room for complacency and there remains an urgent need for a root and branch change in attitude and culture within the NHS.\" </p> <p>There was \"significant evidence\" that the GMC had \"chosen deliberately not to act\" on knowledge of Mr Neale's history in Canada. \"How such a situation can ever be acceptable or fair must now be considered with urgency,\" she said, though that had not been within her terms of reference. </p> <p>The report called for better employment checks before doctors were recruited, suggesting that a new body, or a more powerful Council for the Regulation of Healthcare Professionals, should oversee the employment of doctors just as the GMC is meant to determine their fitness to practise. </p> <p>Last night the health secretary, John Reid, said Mr Neale had fallen short of the high standards of care patients had a right to expect, but steps were being taken to avoid similar incidents. </p> <p>Tim Annett, of the law firm Alexander Harris, representing 30 former patients, said they hoped \"positive changes will be taken to change the culture that informs complaints handling within the NHS\". </p> <p>The GMC was \"sorry for the way the Neale case was handled in the 1980s\" but fundamental reforms meant the GMC was confident it could not recur.</p>",
  "The actor Fritha Goodey, who has died aged 31, was conspicuously and classically beautiful, but it was clear that her talent ran deeper than outward show. She was blonde, willowy, graceful, entrancing; perfect casting, as she proved at the National Theatre in 2000, for Proust's alluring Odette in Remembrance Of Things Past, a stage version of Harold Pinter's un-filmed screenplay. <p>At the time of her death, she was preparing to appear in a revival of Terence Rattigan's Man And Boy, directed by Maria Aitken, at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford, opposite David Suchet. </p> <p>Named after the girl in Paul Gallico's story The Snow Goose, Goodey was born in Kingston-upon-Thames, and went to secondary school at Grey Court, Ham. After attending a local drama school, she was accepted at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda). While there, she suffered from anorexia, but after three years was well enough to finish the course. </p> <p>Following some radio work, she took her first television job, in Roger, Roger (1998), after which she appeared with Joanna Lumley in Dr Willoughby, and in Randall &amp; Hopkirk Deceased (both 1999). Her screen career - far more varied than might, at first, be assumed - included About A Boy (2002), in which she was one of Hugh Grant's former girlfriends. She will be seen in the forthcoming remake of Alfie, starring Jude Law. </p> <p>She also had character roles as a low-life Londoner in Hearts And Bones, as an Irish terrorist in an American mini-series and as a foul-mouthed, horrid ballerina in the short film Table Twelve. She had a lovely voice and, worked extensively on radio. </p> <p>Goodey's was a successful career just waiting to burst into the big time; one special role would have done it. As it was, she made her mark over five years with Max Stafford-Clark's Out of Joint touring company, firstly in Mark Ravenhill's Some Explicit Polaroids (1999), the follow-up to his controversial success, Shopping And Fucking. </p> <p>She played Nadia, a sexy nightclub dancer who sounded as though she had fallen off the self-help shelf in a pop psychology section. \"You're OK, I'm OK,\" she would chant, mantra-like, a deluded victim of her own low self-esteem, who saw the sexual violence committed on her as a vague positive in a world where \"nothing means anything\". </p> <p>In 2002, again with Out of Joint, she played a delightful Constance Neville in She Stoops To Conquer, and a very funny, gorgeous Mrs Garrick, keeping an eye on her great actor husband in April de Angelis's A Laughing Matter, a new companion piece to Goldsmith's comedy, and performing an exquisite little dance in the entr'acte. </p> <p>Stafford-Clark said Goodey was a joy to work with, and often wrote to him with ideas for projects. \"In the circumstances, I'm glad I replied to her on at least one occasion. An actor's life can be miserable, always waiting for other people to define your existence for you. Her beauty was a blessing, and also the reverse, as her looks often determined her parts.\" </p> <p>Last Saturday, Goodey visited rehearsals of Stafford-Clark's new production of Macbeth; she had become a close friend of Monica Dolan, who is playing Lady Macbeth. Dolan attested to Goodey's extraordinary range of knowledge in painting and literature, and her ability to read any social situation: \"She knew immediately how people were feeling and she loved watching rehearsals, even when she wasn't involved.\" </p> <p>In Stephen Poliakoff's The Lost Prince on television, a little boy crouching beside a garden gate sees a fleeting vision of a beautiful young woman. This was Fritha Goodey, and the tragedy of her death (she left a suicide note in the Notting Hill apartment where she was found) reinforces the poignancy of her too brief and more than promising career. </p> <p>She is survived by her parents and an older sister. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Fritha Jane Goodey, actor, born October 23 1972; died September 5 2004</p>",
  "<p>To startled media watchers, political documentaries have become commercially viable, with customers paying hard cash to be enlightened, excoriated and browbeaten by the likes of Michael Moore and other less flamboyant crusaders whose rants would normally be confined to public television. Films about al-Jazeera (Control Room) and corporate malfeasance (The Corporation), have received theatrical openings, as have cinematic essays on the arterial dangers of a McDonald's diet (Super Size Me), the egregiousness of Fox Television (Outfoxed), the machinations of Karl Rove (Bush's Brain), the illegal retention of immigrants (Persons of Interest). </p> <p>Needless to say, most of these are from the left-liberal side of the political spectrum, which finds itself locked in a titanic struggle to defeat the Bush juggernaut in November. </p> <p>But what about narrative cinema? What are the ideological underpinnings during this critical moment? In the old days, vigilantes were on the alert for communist rhetoric shoehorned into the most innocent of Hollywood scripts. Adrian Scott, one of the Hollywood 10, worked on the screenplay of Swing Time, contributing the following exchange. Fred Astaire's debonair but impoverished gambler has inadvertently given his \"lucky\" nickel for change to working girl Ginger Rogers. A misunderstanding grows into a shouting match when a cop appears and, taking Astaire in dance costume for a swell, immediately sides with him. \"We have to protect rich people like you from crazy dames like her,\" he assures Astaire, to which Rogers shoots back: \"You Cossack!\" </p> <p>Surely, in these polarised times, the blandest films aren't immune from the sneak attack. Can we detect biases favourable or unfavourable to the Republican party in recent offerings? </p> <p>We Don't Live Here Anymore, with its erotically charged quartet, appears to be a throwback to a 1970s sex-lib fascination with wife-swapping, a darker, sexier and more maudlin version of Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice. The adulterous shenanigans of the two couples - English profs Peter Krause and Mark Ruffalo, married, respectively, to Naomi Watts and Laura Dern - might be seized upon by the right as proof of the decline of family values, just the sort of selfish behaviour typical of east coast smartypants secular bohemians. On the other hand, the world of the film, adapted from two Andre Dubus novellas, is so pre-feminist that the two wives, despite severe shortages of income, never consider getting a job ... or forming a consciousness-raising group to complain about their lying husbands. Blue or red? Ambiguous. </p> <p>While most of the major studios are running from overtly political themes - Disney having passed on Fahrenheit 9/11 and Warners on David O Russell's Iraq documentary - 20th Century Fox surprised with Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow, a virtual screed on the dire consequences of global warming. Mostly it was a special effects extravaganza, in which Los Angeles is decimated by tornadoes and New York submerged under ice. The movie would seem to wear its Democratic heart on its sleeve; the obstructionist economy-first vice president bears an undisguised resemblance to Dick Cheney. On the other hand, the two states, California and New York, that serve as targets are solidly in the blue state alignment. </p> <p>Any movie sympathetic to gays (A Home at the End of the World) obviously falls into the liberal camp, but even Shrek 2 addresses bigotry. Thanks to his marriage to Princess Fiona, Shrek now stands at the portals of respectability. But will his aristocratic in-laws accept him? Can mum and dad overcome class and species (red state) prejudices and embrace not one, but two, ogres in the family, persons of colour? </p> <p>Mum and dad are inhabited by the veddy English voices of John Cleese and Julie Andrews, two of a number of emissaries from the British isles to provide class (red state) and wisdom (neutral). Ian Holm appears as a sadder but wiser Scottish meteorologist in The Day After Tomorrow, one of the few resonant and likable characters, a compensation perhaps for the film's unkind deep freeze of the UK. But the same actor is sad but not so wise as the analyst-father in Zach Braff's winningly befuddled and very personal first film, Garden State. Braff, as a depressed would-be actor who returns home (New Jersey) for his mother's funeral, has been doped up for years with antidepressants by his father, who is also, most unwisely, his analyst. When the young man throws away his \"meds\" and rebels against his imperial father, can we take this as a kind of July 4 parable of the young colony's declaration of independence against British paternalism? </p> <p>Brits like Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole, inhabiting roles rather than adapting them to modern tastes, salvage what there is to salvage in Troy, a softened and liberalised version of Homer's Iliad in which Brad Pitt's buff Achilles is more introspective Hamlet than pre-Renaissance action hero. Unfortunately, blue state liberalism is here profoundly at odds with the essential brutality, the how-glorious-it-is-to-die ethos and pre-Romantic sensibility of ancient Greece. </p> <p>And finally, in a reverse casting gambit, cheeky Reese Witherspoon has been imported to play that grasping and glorious schemer Becky Sharp in Mira Nair's mod-progressive adaptation of Thackeray's sprawling satiric canvas of Victorian England. A parable of post-feminist empowerment - a gal's gotta do what a gal's gotta do - the film says it's okay to root wholeheartedly for this anachronistic material girl. </p> <p>On the fundamentalist right we have Exorcist: the Beginning, but the depredations of the devil are child's play compared with the relentlessly bloody Jesus-flaying spectacle presented in The Passion of the Christ. Indeed, Mel Gibson has become the standard bearer of a nutty holier-than-thou constituency of the perpetually enraged. To his crucifixion opus he has added, as producer, another gratuitously bloodthirsty little number called Paparazzi, which takes a twisted page from the Dodi and Diana story to furnish a self-righteous star with an excuse to go on a homicidal rampage against offending photographers.</p>",
  "<p>Few understand the hazards of flying through the air while waving a sword better than the 25-year-old actress Zhang Ziyi. She first tried it in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon when she emerged unscathed, but in Hero, the latest wire-suspended martial arts extravaganza, she wasn't so fortunate. In an elaborate fight scene between Ziyi and her co-star Maggie Cheung, she discovered how perilous these balletic fight scenes can be. </p> <p>\"Maggie didn't know martial arts, so I was afraid to hurt her,\" she says, sitting in her publicist's office in Los Angeles. Ziyi is so demure, porcelain pretty and gently spoken that it's hard to imagine her hurting anyone, much less with a sword. \"But it happened. I cut her right hand with my knife. I felt so bad. The blood went everywhere.\" </p> <p>The scene involved Ziyi swooping in with a sword while Cheung repelled her by whipping up a supernatural wind of autumn leaves. The clock was ticking - they had only three days to get the fight right, since the leaves would quickly darken. To make things even harder, the director Zhang Yimou insisted that Ziyi should not blink, despite the bright sun, so after every take, Ziyi's eyes were streaming. As it turned out, there were tears with or without the sun. </p> <p>\"I started crying because Maggie is my idol,\" she says. \"She keep saying, 'It's nothing.' But it was a big cut. I keep saying, 'Sorry.' But I feel so ... \" She chews her lip, and emits a burst of Mandarin into a nearby speakerphone. She has a translator on hand, who promptly pipes up: \"Guilty!\" </p> <p>With Hero and Crouching Tiger on her CV, Ziyi has the distinction of having starred in both of the biggest Chinese films to have crossed over to the west in recent history. She joins that list of Chinese actors - Jackie Chan, Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun Fat and Jet Li - who are stopped in the streets of Beverly Hills and Beijing. Like Crouching Tiger, Hero is a critical and commercial success. Unquestionably one of the most visually breathtaking films ever made, it is also the biggest ever opening of any Asian film in US box-office history, and the second largest opening of any film in a foreign language (topped only by The Passion of the Christ). \"If Crouching Tiger opened the door for Chinese cinema,\" says Ziyi, \"then I think Hero can keep it open for a while.\" </p> <p>The story begins with Jet Li as \"Nameless\", an assassin who arrives at the court of the tyrannical king of Qin, in 3BC, the very king who went on to become the first emperor of China. Nameless announces that he has killed the three assassins who most concern the king - Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Sky (Donnie Yen) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung). As the story unfolds, through a series of conflicting flashbacks, Rashomon-style, we discover how Nameless found his way to the king's door, and what part Ziyi plays, as Sword's loyal assistant, Moon. </p> <p>Hero is such a gorgeous spectacle, words like \"transcendent\" and \"poetic\" have rarely been so apt. Each version of Nameless's tale is given a vivid colour scheme; each sequence is exquisitely composed. Zhang Yimou has such a particular eye that for Ziyi's fight scene with Cheung, for example, he says: \"I had a guy out there [inner Mongolia] specifically to keep an eye on the leaves. He made videotapes of their progress as they turned from green to yellow.\" Ziyi herself describes Yimou as \"the kind of director who knows everything in his mind; the whole picture. He tells you exactly what he wants and if you give it to him, it's done. Even in only two takes.\" </p> <p>She should know. She has made three films with Yimou - her first, A Road Home, then Hero and the forthcoming House of Flying Daggers, which premiered at Cannes to rave reviews. She understands his ways by now; she's a muse. Yimou's relationship with the actress Gong Li fell apart when Ziyi came along, though both vigorously deny any rumours of an affair. \"I'm too busy to have a boyfriend,\" she says, \"no time, much too rush.\" </p> <p>Certainly this is a bumper year for the actress. As well as her fertile collaboration with Yimou, she appears in 2046 in October, the latest movie by Wong Kar Wei, the fabled Chinese director best known for not providing his actors with a complete script. \"It was so hard working for him, but I like the challenge. We don't learn the script, every day we had to, erm ... \" The speakerphone announces: \"improvise!\" </p> <p>\"I'm picky about my parts because I don't want to waste time,\" she says, purposefully. \"I'm young, so I want to learn.\" And she tuts and shakes her head when she remembers how much time she wasted on the set of Rush Hour 2. \"I should have at least learnt English,\" she says, chiding herself. </p> <p>She begins her next venture in a matter of weeks - the long-awaited adaptation of Arthur Golden's bestseller Memoirs of a Geisha, here in LA. Well aware of the controversy surrounding the book - Nitta Sayuri, on whom it is based, resents the focus on prostitution - the film, she promises, will be \"a very different story\". It's a prospect that fills her with excitement and trepidation. \"It's my first time in a lead and I have to speak English!\" She steels herself. \"In a Japanese accent!\" </p> <p>Ziyi had never entertained thoughts of a Hollywood career until she had one. She grew up in Beijing, the daughter of an economist father and a kindergarten teacher mother, and trained as a dancer throughout school. She has spoken about having a \"dark time\" at the Beijing Dance Academy, even running away at the age of 13, prompting her mother to call the police. \"I wanted to escape so badly, so I hid in a little thicket of grass,\" she once said. \"I could hear all the teachers calling my name, but it was only when I heard my mum's voice that I came out. It was a fleeting kind of escape.\" </p> <p>Her fortunes turned when, at 18, Zhang Yimou plucked her from a line-up of models for a shampoo commercial he was shooting. Out of 40,000 applicants, he cast her in the lead of A Road Home, a breathless and charming love story, that won the Jury Grand Prix Silver Bear award at the 2000 Berlin film festival. Then Ang Lee hired her for Crouching Tiger, a tumultuous experience by any stretch. Yet again, the shoot was so tough that it made her cry. </p> <p>\"Ang Lee likes to do many takes,\" she says. \"He wants something from one shot and something else from another. So I had so much pressure, I couldn't sleep; I just cried every night. I called my friend saying 'I don't know what shall I do tomorrow'.\" </p> <p>Crouching Tiger made Ziyi a superstar. In China, she has notched up a string of endorsements - Coca-Cola, Tag Heuer, Pantene, Maybelline ... (Today, her brother works full time on that side of the business). Meanwhile, she fields a flurry of offers from Hollywood. She accepted her first in 2001 - the kung fu cop caper Rush Hour 2, starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker - and she still recalls with a gasp what a culture shock it was. Never before had she been confronted with such an abundance of time and money. </p> <p>\"You have weekends. Two days off every week!\" she says, as though she has just discovered the concept. \"So easy! In China, we work the whole time, no breaks. Hero was five months. House of Flying Daggers was six months. And I couldn't believe the size of the wardrobe car. It was shocking!\" she giggles. \"And the food! You can have so many different kinds of food. It was so comfortable. It seemed like people would get lazy! In China, we don't have trailers. For Hero we did, because it is a big project so they spent some money for us, but usually you just sit in your own car.\" </p> <p>Though Ziyi describes Hero as a big project - and it certainly seems vast on the screen - the budget was still only $2 million, not enough to coax most Hollywood A-listers out of bed. Ziyi boggles at what Hero would have cost as a DreamWorks production. She's still giddy at the splendour of the Rush Hour 2 set - the well-marshalled staff, the experts in makeup, hair, set design and so on. \"It's so professional here. There are 10 people, where in China we have only one - the director is in charge of everything,\" says Ziyi. \"Even the make-up. He will say, 'Why your eyebrow is crooked, not same as last scenes?' Especially Zhang Yimou.\" </p> <p>There's much she loves about Los Angeles. She finds the fans \"more civilised\" and she gets a big kick out of star-spotting about town. \"Last night, I saw Sharon Stone having dinner!\" she laughs. \"But I was too embarrassed to say anything.\" She has friends here from her Rush Hour 2 days, and she would buy a place here, she says, \"when my English improves, maybe\". She seems somehow half-hearted. Her heart remains in China. Rather than cash in on the lucrative offers that Hollywood piles at her door, for instance, she has chosen to work with acclaimed Chinese directors for smaller fees. And though she says she is unfazed by the nomadic life out of apartments and hotel rooms - \"I'm used to it by now\" - her face softens at the mention of her family. \"I try to make my room like home, I bring all my toys,\" she says, bashfully. \"You know, teddy bears, a little sheep. Some cute stuff.\" </p> <p>It's time for her to leave. Two hours of English classes lie ahead of her. Yet for a moment, all the sword-wielding martial-arts superstar can think of is her little sheep. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Hero is released on September 24; House of Flying Daggers is out on December 26; 2046 will be released in January 2005; Memoirs of a Geisha is currently in production.</p>",
  "<p>Sigmund Freud may have been right all along. Dreams really could be our unconscious minds giving us a glimpse of our deepest, darkest desires. </p> <p>Proponents of Freud's theories on psychoanalysis - for so long scorned by the scientific establishment - may well be rejoicing. Scientists will today announce that they have found the region of the brain where dreams originate. </p> <p>Swiss doctors, writing in the Annals of Neurology, describe the case of a 73-year-old woman who suffered a stroke to the occipital lobe of her brain. This region is responsible for the processing of visual information and, unsurprisingly, the stroke impaired the patient's sight. A few days later she regained her sight, but a new problem emerged which astonished the doctors: the patient stopped dreaming. </p> <p>Dr Claudio L Bassetti, a neurologist at the University Hospital of Zurich in Switzerland and one of the authors of the paper, said they had stumbled on an important clue to the origins of dreams. The patient's experiences pointed to that part of the brain that acted as a sort of dream factory, as well as the extent of lesions needed to stop it working. \"As such, they offer a target for further study of the localisation of dreaming,\" he concluded. </p> <p>Dr Bassetti and his colleague Dr Matthias Bischof used MRI scans to determine that the patient's stroke had damaged areas located deep in the back half of her brain. Recent work has shown that this region is involved in the visual processing of faces and landmarks, as well as emotions and visual memories. The scientists say that it is a logical set of functions for a brain area that could generate or control dreams. </p> <p>For six weeks following the stroke, Dr Bassetti also studied the patient's brain waves as she slept. They found no disruptions in her sleep cycle. Her rapid eye movement (REM) sleep - a paradoxical state where we remain fast asleep but our brains are as highly aroused and active as during normal waking hours - was normal. </p> <p>That was significant because dreaming and REM sleep often occur together. For many years it was thought that REM sleep was the physical manifestation of the dream state. Dr Bassetti's work therefore points to different brain systems underlying the two. </p> <p>For generations scientists and psychologists have tried to unravel the mystery of dreams. Dream interpretation was a fundamental part of Freud's work at the turn of the 20th century. He argued that dreams were a form of wish fulfilment during sleep, arising from our sexual urges. But his ideas were entirely subjective and, as such, scientists have struggled to accept them. </p> <p><strong> Motivation</strong><br> </p> <p>In the late 1980s, Professor Mark Solms at the University of Cape Town proposed that two specific areas of the brain were required for the formation of dreams: the occipital lobe and a part of the brain's frontal lobe that controlled motivation. </p> <p>Prof Solms' theory also proposed a scientific way to explain psychoanalysis. Freud had argued that dreams were representative of desires, and Prof Solms had argued that dreams were controlled by a part of the brain that controlled motivation. </p> <p>Dr Bassetti's work serves to prove part of Prof Solms' theory and the experiment itself is a great leap forward from what has come before. </p> <p>\"A lot of the time if somebody's got brain damage and they can't tell you any dreams, there's the possibility that it's because they've got bad memories,\" said Dr Mark Blagrove, a psychologist at Swansea University. This can yield false results because it might look as though the person is not actually able to produce dreams. </p> <p>But Dr Bassetti's work got around this problem by investigating the patient's attention and memory and ability to imagine things when awake. In addition, the patient reported that she dreamed three or four times a week before her stroke. </p> <p>With time, some dreams did return. A year after her stroke, Dr Bassetti's patient experienced occasional dreams, but no more than one a week. The dreams were also less vivid and intense compared with before the stroke. </p> <p>Dr Bassetti said that more work studying the occipital lobe of the brain was needed to conclusively prove that it was indeed involved in dream production. </p> <p>Many psychologists believe that understanding why we dream is fundamental to understanding the human mind. </p> <p>\"Given that we spend so much of the night dreaming, you may have to come up with some evolutionary theory about why we do it,\" Dr Blagrove said. \"You can come up with two theories: one is that we've evolved to dream and the dream has a function. The other is that something else has evolved and dreaming is just a side product.\" </p> <p>Jennie Parker, a psychology researcher at the University of the West of England, said that dreaming is the most recurring form of human consciousness. \"If we can figure out dreams, we can figure out all other forms of human consciousness,\" she said. </p> <p>Alternatively, the answer to the riddle of dreams may all be quite simple, mundane almost. </p> <p>\"I see them as the cinema of the mind,\" said Dr Jim Horne of the sleep research centre at Loughborough University. \"They're there to keep the brain entertained during the tedious hours of sleep and have very little significance beyond that.\"</p>",
  "<p> Whenever Stuart Law bats as sublimely as this, thoughts turn to what might have been in a Test career that lasted one match. Admittedly he played in 54 one-day internationals but a first-class career average of more than 50 suggests he might have succeeded in the longer version, too, at the highest level. Australia are strong, but that strong? </p> <p>On the other hand, since 1996 (six seasons with Essex and now his third with Lancashire) it has allowed county followers to enjoy dreamy days such as this, delighting in those effortless cover drives which race to the boundary and revelling at the simplicity and pureness of his strokeplay. </p> <p>In scoring his third century (159) of an injury-disrupted season Law made batting look ridiculously easy yesterday on a slow pitch used for two second-team matches earlier in the week. And, of course, there was the gravity of the occasion. This is a must-win game for both sides, each battling against relegation with scant chance of both staying up. Lancashire have still to play Gloucestershire, the other side in the shake-up whose topsy-turvy progress yesterday was followed closely, but this is Worcestershire's last match. </p> <p>The resultant air of desperation seemed to affect most of Law's colleagues, even \"cool\" Carl Hooper who succumbed tamely leg-before, continuing a sorry season for him. Iain Sutcliffe had been his usual gritty self, grinding out a half-century off 116 balls before overbalancing off Ray Price to be smartly stumped by Steve Rhodes in his 440th and final first-class appearance. </p> <p>However, despite a promising debut by Andrew Crook, elder brother of the squad member Steven, it was not until the chipper Glen Chapple joined Law at the fall of the fifth wicket - the pair adding 108 in 25 overs of mostly glorious front-foot driving - that Lancashire looked in control. Chapple's fifty came off 86 balls and Law's hundred off 161. </p> <p>But Andy Bichel put the game back in the balance with two late wickets, claiming a crucial leg-before decision against Law (who looked suitably disgruntled) with five overs remaining.</p>",
  "<p><strong>If football is war with rules, why not play on?</strong></p> <p>Arsenal play Fulham tomorrow. By a nice fluke of exactitude 90 years ago, on September 12 1914, the Gunners beat the Cottagers by 3-0 in the old Second Division. It was not \"just another match\". War had been declared that August, already the news from Mons was dire, and from every poster hoarding Lord Kitchener's index finger was severely demanding volunteers. Already the FA was under fierce attack in Parliament and, notably, from the Times for continuing football's weekend programme. </p> <p>Any club employing a football player, thundered that paper, \"is bribing a needed recruit from enlistment, and every spectator who pays his gate money is contributing towards a German victory\". The scout leader Lord Baden-Powell chipped in for the Daily News: \"War is the real man's game, full of honour and adventure for those with guts in them. Come on, my lads, and lend a hand. We can do our football when we have done our War.\" </p> <p>In the week before Arsenal's match with Fulham, the FA agreed to let the War Office use the half-time interval as a recruiting opportunity, \"with a military band in attendance which, at the end of the game, those spectators who had volunteered would march behind to the nearest recruiting station\". But the Times headline that Monday proclaimed \"One Recruit at Arsenal match\", so the wheeze was not judged a success - and league football continued to the end of the 1915-16 season. </p> <p><strong> Golden anniversaries</strong></p> <p>Today is a notable birthday: Arnold Palmer is 75. So, come to that, is next Friday, when Stirling Moss also logs his three quarters of a century. An apt twosome - simply, no pro sportsman on the planet this week is entitled to ring his agent to check out his zillions without a genuflection to Palmer or Moss. </p> <p>Sure, by their deeds on fields and tracks they changed the way their own sports were perceived - \"Go, Arnie, go!\" hollered one's Army, and \"Who do you think you are? Stirling Moss?\" affectionately chided the other's world of back-seat drivers - but even more momentously the two of them invented the role of sportsman-as-millionaire-endorsement-entrepreneur. Moss was first; his hat-trick of victories in the Alpine Rally in the first three years of the 1950s saw Stirling Moss Ltd founded as a full-time business solely to promote a name, and its chief executive remains probably the most charismatic of any British motoring luminary. After Palmer's 1960 annus mirabilis - the Masters, the US Open and six other titles - his liaison with a young lawyer, Mark McCormack, propelled \"image rights\" into the stratosphere. Where they remain. </p> <p>At work, their dynamic magnetism was touchingly tinged with vulnerability. Moss was dashing at the wheel, Palmer intrepid in the rough. \"Trouble,\" he once said, \"was bad to get into but fun to get out of - in fact, the only unplayable lie is when you're supposed to be playing golf and you come home with lipstick on your collar.\" </p> <p><strong> Henmania not out of season</strong></p> <p> Henmania in the autumn comes as a culture shock. A letter in Wednesday's Daily Telegraph had Brian Stead of Epsom wondering if the phenomenon had reached its nadir on finding \"my 40-year-old son still up at 2.30am watching the Henman match - on Ceefax\". I also enjoyed the softly sarky letter to the same paper in July from Brian Christley of Abergele, Conwy: \"Sir - Stop trying to change Henman. Gardeners realise they shouldn't pick raspberries till he loses in the French, nor their redcurrants till he exits Wimbledon, and so on. Henman is far more reliable than the weather.\" </p> <p>Which is why I have been sweating on the US Open to see if my Bramley apples are ready for harvest. </p> <p><strong> When sports quacks attack</strong></p> <p> \"Sports psychology\" is the fashion but has usually struck me as a money-for-old-rope quacks' trade. Paula Radcliffe was provided with a reassuring team in white coats after the Athens debacles last month and this week, by all accounts, the goalkeeper David James also availed himself of the soothingly spooky buck-up brigade. </p> <p>But why always after the cock-up and not before? Interviewing the solo round-the-world matelot Tony Bullimore, who had survived five days in his upturned boat in the Southern Ocean, I asked what was the first thing his rescuers had said to him. \"They said a sports psychologist was on the way to counsel me. I said, 'Thanks, I'd far prefer a pint of Bass and a whisky chaser'.\"</p>"
