  "A member of the group responsible for the Beslan school massacre last month is a British citizen who attended the infamous Finsbury Park mosque in north London, The Observer can reveal. <p>Two other members of the group, loyal to Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, are also believed to have been active in the UK until less than three years ago. They are suspected of taking part in the raid on the school in which 300 people, half of them children, died. </p> <p>Russian security sources described Kamel Rabat Bouralha, 46 years old and the oldest of the three, as a 'key aide' of Basayev, who has a \u00a35.5 million price on his head. Basayev has boasted of training the men who took control of the school and wired it with explosives. Investigators believe that the three men, all Algerian-born, travelled to Chechnya from London to take part in fighting there in 2001. </p> <p>Russian investigators are thought to have now identified most of the 33 men who occupied the school in Beslan last month. They include two Algerians in their mid-30s called Osman Larussi and Yacine Benalia. Both are thought to have been based in London until recently. Like Bouralha, they too are believed to have attended Finsbury Park mosque and to have joined the network of groups loyal to Basayev on arrival in Chechnya. </p> <p>General Ilya Shabalkin said that Bouralha had been detained while attempting to leave Russia for medical treatment in Azerbaijan. 'He says he is innocent, but there is strong evidence of his involvement in a grave crime,' Shabalkin said. </p> <p>Senior sources at Scotland Yard are investigating the Russian information. Former associates in London confirmed that Bouralha had been a frequent visitor at Finsbury Park mosque from around 2000. </p> <p>According to Russian security sources, there are up to 300 Arab mercenaries operating with rebel formations in Chechnya. However, Moscow has been keen to exaggerate 'foreign' elements among Chechen militants, often blaming 'al-Qaeda' despite little evidence to suggest the group's involvement. Recently some analysts have tried to establish links between Chechen militants and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's al-Tauhid group, which is holding Ken Bigley hostage in Iraq.</p> <p>The Observer has obtained detailed reports into al-Zarqawi's group compiled largely from 'communications intercepts' by a Western intelligence service. A series of telephones seized from militants has allowed investigators to build up a picture of a European network that stretches from Poland to the UK. There are several references to obtaining false documents from London.</p>",
  "It is the ultimate form of extreme holiday 'fun'. Tourists, bored with SAS survival weekends, trekking trips in the Antarctic and booking space flights with Richard Branson, will soon be able to fly to Norway - and shoot baby seals. <p>The decision to launch the vacations - which have aroused the fury of animal rights groups - follows the recent move by the Norwegian government to expand its annual culling of seals so that amateur enthusiasts can join in. </p> <p>The aim is to bring about a dramatic increase in the number of deaths of seals, which are blamed by fishermen for devastating drops in the North Sea marine stocks. But the effect has been to outrage conservation groups. </p> <p>'Killing a baby seal is about the easiest thing you can do if you're inclined to be sadistic; you certainly can't say there's any sport in it - the animal is totally defenceless,' said Paul Watson, founder and president of the radical Sea Shepherd group. </p> <p>The expansion of Norway's seal cull comes into force in January, following intense lobbying by fishermen, who say the country's large seal population is not only devastating cod and other fish stocks but is infecting other marine life with parasites. </p> <p>Companies are already offering holidays to both experienced hunters and beginners to take advantage of this relaxation of rules. NorSafari is advertising on the internet for trips that start at 1,400 kroner - about \u00a3110 - for a day's hunting and one seal. This rises to 8,200 kroner, or \u00a3650, for four days and the guarantee of two seals. </p> <p>The company's website shows photos of hunters posing with their kill and offers trips that not only include accommodation and food but help with cutting up and preserving seal carcasses. Training is available for beginners, it adds. </p> <p>Some packages offer a refund to disappointed hunters who don't kill the advertised catch. Extra seals shot will cost another 500 kroner, while another company, Polar Events, advertises: 'We will make sure that your hunt is one not soon forgotten.' </p> <p>Professional seal hunters have traditionally used clubs to kill seals, but Polar Events' boss, Kjetil Kristoffersen, said tourists would be given rifles to hunt their prey. </p> <p>'Seals have been hunted in Norway for many years and it's part of the culture,' said Kristoffersen. 'We want people who are interested in hunting, not people who just come to shoot the animal... the tradition up here in Norway [is] we hunt the seal to eat it; it's food.' </p> <p>Animal rights activists and conservation groups fear that helpless baby seals will become the prime, easy targets of tourists. They also warn that seals are in danger of being over-hunted. </p> <p>Seal hunting has been a tradition in Norway for thousands of years, but has dwindled recently with only about half the annual 1,200 quota being killed each year. Despite this, under pressure from fishermen the quota was raised to more than 2,000 a couple of years ago. </p> <p>The decision to include tourists in a practice which, until now has been confined to local experts, is designed to help meet that quota. </p> <p>Announcing the plan, Norway's Fisheries Minister, Svein Ludvigsen, said the move would 'restore the balance' between fish and seals along Norway's coast and claimed that the hunting of seals was no different from hunting moose. Others liken the practice to hunting foxes, big game or even fish and birds. 'This could be a big hit,' added the minister, whose father was a trawler captain. </p> <p>This optimism is not shared by many others outside Norway, however, and last week the government appeared to be backing down from its enthusiastic endorsement of seal-hunting holidays on its shores. Ministers worry that the move, even if popular with hunters, will damage the country's image for the majority of tourists. </p> <p>'This is certainly not an image we are keen to be portrayed with,' said Eirik Bergesen, an information adviser for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although he stressed that 'for ordinary hunting you can come to Norway and hunt, so what we're doing is actually bringing the rules for seal hunting in accordance with those other hunting laws and guidelines'. </p> <p>The idea of the holidays was also attacked by the International Fund for Animal Welfare. 'Tourists should be encouraged to enjoy and protect wild animals in their natural habitat rather than kill them,' said spokeswoman Gill Sanders. </p> <p>Some campaigners have disputed the fishermen's claims that there is a link between seals and the decline in fish stocks. 'That's never been scientifically proven,' added Maren Esmark, marine conservation officer for the Norwegian branch of wildlife charity WWF. </p> <p>Some argue that over-fishing is the cause of devastated fish stocks. Seals, they point out, have happily coexisted with other marine life for most of their history. </p> <p>'Our position is more seals, more fish,' said Watson. 'The biggest predator of fish like cod is other fish - and seals keep fish like that in check.' </p> <p>So far, it is unclear how popular the hunts will prove with visitors, however. Polar Events has had no overseas bookings yet. But the website for NorSafari says 'many of the people we have spoken to would like to come to Norway to go seal hunting. Already there is sufficient interest for us to invite hunters to an exciting hunt.' And the Norwegian Hunting and Fishing Association told Jeger (Hunter) magazine there was expected to be interest abroad, especially from Germany. </p> <p><b>Other tasteless trips</b></p> <p><b> Iraq: </b> thrill-seeking travellers visit the war zones </p> <p><b> US: </b> trophy-hunters shoot old zoo animals such as lions and elephants, sometimes when they are chained up </p> <p><b> Africa: </b> safari hunters compete to shoot the most big game - often including endangered species </p> <p><b> Britain: </b> tour company offers the chance to sleep rough like a homeless person </p> <p><b> Norway: </b> trippers spend a day whale-watching ... then tuck into whale steak for supper </p> <p><b> Faroe Islands: </b> visitors go out in boats to watch local whale hunters</p>",
  "Prisoner interrogations at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the controversial US military detention centre where guards have been accused of brutality and torture, have not prevented a single terrorist attack, according to a senior Pentagon intelligence officer who worked at the heart of the US war on terror. <p>Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Christino, who retired last June after 20 years in military intelligence, says that President George W Bush and US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld have 'wildly exaggerated' their intelligence value. </p> <p>Christino's revelations, to be published this week in Guant\u00e1namo: America's War on Human Rights, by British journalist David Rose, are supported by three further intelligence officials. Christino also disclosed that the 'screening' process in Afghanistan which determined whether detainees were sent to Guant\u00e1namo was 'hopelessly flawed from the get-go'. </p> <p>It was performed by new recruits who had almost no training, and were forced to rely on incompetent interpreters. They were 'far too poorly trained to identify real terrorists from the ordinary Taliban militia'. </p> <p>According to Christino, most of the approximately 600 detainees at Guant\u00e1namo - including four Britons - at worst had supported the Taliban in the civil war it had been fighting against the Northern Alliance before the 11 September attacks, but had had no contact with Osama bin Laden or al-Qaeda. </p> <p>For six months in the middle of 2003 until his retirement, Christino had regular access to material derived from Guant\u00e1namo prisoner interrogations, serving as senior watch officer for the central Pentagon unit known as the Joint Intelligence Task Force-Combating Terrorism (JITF-CT). This made him responsible for every piece of information that went in or out of the unit, including what he describes as 'analysis of critical, time-sensitive intelligence'. </p> <p>In his previous assignment in Germany, one of his roles had been to co-ordinate intelligence support to the US army in Afghanistan, at Guant\u00e1namo, and to units responsible for transporting prisoners there. </p> <p>Bush, Rumsfeld and Major General Geoffrey Miller, Guant\u00e1namo's former commandant who is now in charge of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, have repeatedly claimed that Guant\u00e1namo interrogations have provided 'enormously valuable intelligence,' thanks to a system of punishments, physical and mental abuse and rewards for for co-operation, introduced by Miller and approved by Rumsfeld. </p> <p>In a speech in Miami, Rumsfeld claimed: 'Detaining enemy combatants... can help us prevent future acts of terrorism. It can save lives and I am convinced it can speed victory.' </p> <p>However, Christino says, General Miller had never worked in intelligence before being assigned to Guant\u00e1namo, and his system seems almost calculated to produce entirely bogus confessions. </p> <p>Earlier this year, three British released detainees, Asif Iqbal, Shafiq Rasul Rhuhel Ahmed, revealed that they had all confessed to meeting bin Laden and Mohamed Atta, leader of the 11 September hijackers, at a camp in Afghanistan in 2000. All had cracked after three months isolated in solitary confinement and interrogation sessions in chains that lasted up to 12 hours daily. </p> <p>Eventually, MI5 proved what they had said initially - that none had left the UK that year. Rasul had been working at a branch of Currys. The disclosures come on the eve of a House of Lords appeal on the fate of the foreign terrorist suspects held without trial in British prisons. </p> <p>Tomorrow, the Lords will determine whether it was lawful for the government to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights to allow for the detention of the men at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. It is widely believed that some of the men are held on evidence obtained from prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo. An officer from MI5 admitted under cross-examination by lawyers acting for the detainees that the British intelligence services would make use of information obtained under torture by foreign governments. </p> <p>A high court appeal in August found that it was lawful for the British government to use information obtained under torture by foreign governments to avert an imminent attack, but there was no evidence that it had done so in the case of the detainees held in British jails. </p> <p>Speaking at an Observer fringe meeting at the Labour party conference last week, Lord Chancellor Charlie Falconer backed the decision of the court but said it was 'an almost impossible ethical question'. </p> <p>While emphasising that Britain repudiated the use of torture he said: 'We cannot condone torture, but the basis of those incarcerations is protection of other people. If we thought that 'X' was going to blow up the Tube and we thought that information was obtained by a foreign intelligence service, can we really say that we can't detain people because that information was obtained by torture? </p> <p>'That's the dilemma the government is faced with. The courts have taken the view as a matter of law, that we are entitled to rely on it and I have the awful feeling that is probably the right conclusion.'</p>",
  "It will be one of the most important tests of legal principles Britain has ever seen. A special panel of nine Law Lords will meet tomorrow to decide whether indefinite detention is acceptable under British and international law. The judges will also consider whether the government is entitled to rely on evidence obtained by the torture of people abroad. Nothing less than Britain's values are at stake. <p>The government suspended core human rights in the wake of 9/11, allowing it to detain foreign nationals indefinitely without charge or trial. It says it is entitled to rely on evidence produced by torture elsewhere. </p> <p>If the panel decides these changes are justified, a profound and dangerous shift will have taken place. The principle of equality under the law - a cornerstone of the legal system in democratic countries around the world - will have been abandoned. Worse still, the absolute ban on torture will have been seriously undermined. </p> <p>The government has said that the power to detain foreign nationals indefinitely is justified because the UK faces a serious threat from terrorism. </p> <p>It also insists that the suspects detained, at Belmarsh prison in south-east London and elsewhere, are free to leave the country at any time. It says it abhors torture, but says it would 'be irresponsible' to ignore information on terrorism from elsewhere, even if torture was used. </p> <p>The threat from terrorism is real. But it does not justify the erosion of core human rights, in legal or in practical terms. The government believes it is entitled to remove basic legal rights from people merely because they hold a foreign passport. Yet most of those arrested on terrorism charges since 9/11 have been British citizens, who rightly continue to enjoy the traditional safeguards of the legal system: they must be charged and put on trial, or released. </p> <p>The government argues that the detainees cannot be prosecuted under current laws. But those same constraints limit prosecutions against British terror suspects, too. The answer is to reform the law - by allowing judges more discretion in the use of phone tap evidence, say - so those who act against national security can be put on trial, Britons and non-Britons alike. </p> <p>A ruling in favour of indefinite detention is unlikely to impress British Muslims, many of whom regard the detentions as an injustice targeted against their community. There is growing evidence that the government's policy alienates the very group whose co-operation the police and security services need most to combat terrorism. </p> <p>The recent release of D, an Algerian detainee, does not mean the necessary safeguards are in place. On the contrary, it underscores the arbitrariness of the government's approach. </p> <p>D still knows neither the case against him, nor why he has been freed. His reaction, on hearing that his long detention was about to end was: 'I don't understand.' Lack of logic is a constant. </p> <p>At Belmarsh - unlike at Guant\u00e1namo - many detainees are not even questioned, despite being held for more than two years. The Home Office believes this is 'not extraordinary'. </p> <p>The government's line on torture is even more pernicious. Torture is a universal taboo. There are no excuses or exceptions, and no government in the world will admit carrying it out. </p> <p>Britain was key in drawing up international rules outlawing torture and a convention aimed at making them stick. Last August, the government successfully argued in the Court of Appeal that information gained under torture can be used if the UK is not involved directly. </p> <p>The arguments for torture are superficially seductive. How, it is argued, can it be wrong to torture somebody who may have information that could save lives? Once the door to torture is open, however, experience suggests it is impossible to close. The message that it is sometimes acceptable undermines more than half a century of work to eradicate this moral cancer. </p> <p>Concern is mounting about Britain's counter-terrorism strategy. The Privy Counsellor Review Committee called for the 'urgent repeal' of the indefinite detention regime. The all-party parliamentary Joint Human Rights Committee pointed to the 'corrosive effect' of the policy. Lord Justice Neuberger, who dissented from the appeal judgment, argued that by relying on torture evidence, Britain was 'losing the moral high ground an open democratic society enjoys'. </p> <p>The government has an obligation to protect those who reside in the UK. It also has a duty to safeguard the country's fundamental values. We have seen little evidence that the current counter-terrorism strategy has made Britain a safer place. </p> <p>Yet it has eroded the ban on torture, undermined the principle of equality under the law and weakened the right to a fair trial. The Law Lords have a historic opportunity to restore the balance. All those who care about liberty must hope they seize it. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ben Ward is a leading barrister and counsel in the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch</p>",
  "Opposite Camp Delta's main gate is a little wooden pergola, an observation point where journalists are allowed to take photographs and watch who comes and goes. <p>Spotting the interrogators isn't difficult. Instead of battle-dress and sweaty black boots, they wear polo shirts, lightweight shoes, khakis or even shorts, and most of them look surprisingly young - well under 30. Most are accompanied by older men, many of them swarthy - their interpreters or, as intelligence men call them, 'terps'. Interrogations take place day and night, in rows of 'booths' - bare, air-conditioned rooms inside converted trailers behind the cell blocks. </p> <p>Guant\u00e1namo Bay's advocates say their success rate is astounding. Harvesting intelligence through interrogations has become the principal raison d'\u00eatre of 'Gitmo', as Guant\u00e1namo is popularly known. If the political rhetoric of the camp's early weeks planted the idea of a direct link between the detainees and 9/11, interrogations and their vaunted worth have maintained it and thus enabled Gitmo's lonely guards to cling to a sense of purpose. </p> <p>In the words of US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld: 'Detaining enemy combatants... provides us with intelligence that can help us prevent future acts of terrorism. It can save lives and, indeed, I am convinced it can speed victory.' </p> <p>Captain Gregg Langevin, 32, a reservist whose civilian job is as a McDonald's rep in Massachusetts, told me he missed his family and was ready to resign from the reserves at the cost of his military pension rather than risk being mobilised for another tour of duty abroad. But he kept himself going day to day by convincing himself of the worth of his mission: 'Above all else, I know that good intelligence is being gathered.' </p> <p>He and his fellow soldiers have been fed a lie. During my own trip to Gitmo in October 2003, there was no more enthusiastic exponent of this mission than the Joint Task Force commandant, Major-General Geoffrey Miller. Though short in stature, his favourite words were 'enormous' and 'enormously'. </p> <p>'We are developing information of enormous value to the nation, enormously valuable intelligence,' he said with passion. 'We have an enormously thorough process that has very high resolution and clarity... I think of Guant\u00e1namo as the interrogation battle lab in the war against terror.' </p> <p>Until Miller, now running Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, where he exported his methods in the summer of 2003, went to Gitmo, he had never filled an intelligence post in his life. His predecessor, Brigadier-General Rick Baccus, was accused on his departure by Pentagon officials of 'coddling' detainees; under his command the intelligence from Guant\u00e1namo was no more than a trickle. </p> <p>There were two possible reasons for this: either the prisoners knew very little about terrorism and al-Qaeda, or they were not being questioned with sufficient skill. Miller decided it had to be the latter. In public, he told reporters, the sixfold increase in 'high-value' intelligence he achieved in 2003 was solely due to the judicious use of carrots: offering rewards, in the shape of better privileges and conditions. In private, there was also a menacing stick. </p> <p>Rumsfeld approved a range of measures for use against reluctant prisoners, including solitary confinement - which could be administered in repeated, back-to-back doses of 30 days - chaining people for hours in chilled or heated interrogation rooms, and what he euphemistically called 'sleep adjustment' - in other words, deprivation. </p> <p>I have obtained the minutes of a meeting between Miller and a delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on 9 October, 2003, when this system was at its peak, which suggest he deliberately misled them as to what was going on. </p> <p>Vincent Cassard, head of the Red Cross inspection team, said the relentless interrogations were having serious consequences for the detainees' mental health. </p> <p>'The ICRC feels that interrogators have too much control over the basic needs of detainees, that the interrogators attempt to control the detainees through use of isolation... The interrogators have total control of the level of isolation in which the detainees were kept; the level of comfort items detainees can receive; also the access for basic needs.' </p> <p>Miller did not like to be lectured in this way, declaring he 'had issues' with the fact that Cassard had raised the interrogation process at all. When the Red Cross man said he was concerned to see that only those who co-operated with interrogators received greater privileges - a clear breach of the Geneva Conventions - Miller simply denied that this was so. Privileges were not removed for non-co-operation but 'for disciplinary reasons. If a detainee loses a privilege, it is as a result of his actions.' </p> <p>Cassard gave the example of interrogators' deciding that unco-operative detainees would not be allowed books. Again, Miller's reply was less than the truth: 'Restrictions can only occur as a result of detainee disciplinary infractions.' </p> <p>Cassard told him that the Red Cross team had heard so many prisoners say that books and other 'comfort items' were confiscated for refusing to talk that they believed this must be true. Miller replied that 'he would listen to the allegations, but he had given the ICRC the accurate facts'. </p> <p>My own Guant\u00e1namo interview with Miller took place just eight days after he spoke to the Red Cross. With me, he made no secret of his belief that subjecting the unco-operative to harsher conditions had boosted the yield of intelligence. </p> <p>Shafiq Rasul, one of the Tipton Three from Staffordshire, who was freed in March, described to me the effect of Miller's system, which after three months' in solitary led him to make a false confession of attending a 9/11 planning meeting with Osama bin Laden and the fanatical Mohamed Atta in Afghanistan in January 2000. He was told the meeting had been videotaped. </p> <p>'The walls [of the interrogation room] were rusty, and they seemed to be soundproofed. There was no ventilation; it was roasting in there. One interrogator told me that anyone who was in Afghanistan was guilty of the murders of 9/11 - even the women and children killed by the American bombing. </p> <p>'But they said my position was much worse, because the meeting in this video was to plan 9/11, and loads of people had told them that this guy in a beard standing behind bin Laden was me. I told them that in 2000 I didn't leave the country, that I was working at the Wednesbury branch of Currys, who would have my employment records. They told me I could have falsified those records - that I could have had someone working with me at Currys who could have altered the data the company held, and travelled on a false passport.' </p> <p>Finally, as his isolation continued and the interrogators deployed their full range of techniques, Rasul said, he cracked. In a final session, a senior official had come down from Washington: 'My heart is beating, beating, I'm saying it's not me, it's not me, but I'm thinking: \"I'm going to be screwed, I'm on an island in the middle of nowhere, there's nothing I can do.\" </p> <p>'This woman had come down and she plays me the video. I say: \"Are you blind? That doesn't look anything like me.\" But it makes no difference. I'd got to the point where I just couldn't take any more. \"Do what you have to do,\" I told them. I'd been sitting there for three months in isolation, so I say, \"Yes, it's me. Go ahead and put me on trial.\"' </p> <p>Intelligence officials fear there may be many more examples - while the case against Britons still held at Guant\u00e1namo, such as Moazzem Begg, a Birmingham father-of-four, also rests on their confessions. </p> <p>For much of 2003 Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony Christino, a military intelligence officer of 20 years' experience, worked at the heart of the intelligence war against terror inside the Pentagon. Interrogators, he said, were woefully inexperienced and underprepared, while in most cases they had to rely on interpreters of very poor quality, such as those provided by the Titan Corporation of San Diego. </p> <p>'It takes far more than locating heritage speakers of Arabic in the United States who can obtain an interim security clearance. Unfortunately, that is essentially what the US army contracted Titan to do,' he said. </p> <p>In early 2003, he revealed, a group of Pentagon intelligence staff became so concerned about the Gitmo interpreters that they submitted a memorandum to their civilian bosses, recommending that interrogations should be taped and spot-checked as a means of verifying their work. Vehemently opposed by Miller, it was rejected. </p> <p>Christino said he did not believe that Guant\u00e1namo, despite its vaunted claims, had helped to prevent a single terrorist attack. 'Most of the information derived from interrogations at Guant\u00e1namo appears to be very general in nature; so general that it is not very useful,' he said. </p> <p>'How much help is it to know that during a class on improvised explosives at a camp in Afghanistan someone discussed bombing apartment complexes or shopping malls in the US? </p> <p>'Chechen terrorists have been bombing apartment complexes in Russia for years, and anyone even vaguely familiar with American consumer culture knows that shopping malls would be a good target. Is it \"enormously valuable intelligence\"? No; it does not identify cities where sympathisers are resident or an execution timeframe, so it is not very useful. </p> <p>'I doubt that anyone detained at Guant\u00e1namo ever had access to that type of information; if some claim that they did, they probably did so to either earn the incentives or avoid the maltreatment that General Miller instituted.' </p> <p>Christino's conclusions were backed by three other intelligence officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. One, an FBI man for 30 years, works on tracking terrorist finance - a field in which Rumsfeld has claimed Gitmo has been especially productive. 'I'm unaware of any important information in my field that's come from Gitmo,' he said. 'It's clearly not a significant source.' </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Guant\u00e1namo Bay: America's War on Human Rights by David Rose is published by Faber on 7 October.

  "Inside Camp Delta, the British former Guant\u00e1namo prisoner Shafiq Rasul told me: 'There's only one rule that matters. You have to obey whatever US government personnel tell you to do.' The cost of disobedience was high: possibly a visit from the camp's 'Extreme Reaction Force (ERF)', a squad of guards in riot gear, which is said by several detainees to have carried out brutal assaults. <p>When these allegations first surfaced, American spokesmen denied them. A leaked internal Guant\u00e1namo document, published here for the first time and headed 'Detainee Standards of Conduct', suggests Rasul and the others were telling the truth. </p> <p>'The following is a set of standards detainees WILL follow at ALL times,' it begins. 'Failure to follow the following standards will result in strict punishment by US security forces.' </p> <p>The first two rules allow 30 minutes for detainees to eat their meals, and just five minutes for showers, although here 'amputees are authorised 10-15 minutes for showers'. Then they become more menacing: </p> <p>3. Detainees WILL NOT be disrespectful to any US security forces personnel or other detainees. </p> <p>4. Detainees will follow the orders of US security forces at ALL times. </p> <p>5. Detainee units can and WILL be searched at any time. </p> <p>6. Detainees WILL NOT harass, annoy, harm or otherwise interfere with the safety or operation of the detention facility. </p> <p>7. Detainees WILL NOT touch, spit, or throw any object at US security forces personnel or other detainees. If any non-issued objects are found in or around unit area, detainees WILL inform US security forces, with no disciplinary action taken. </p> <p>8 Detainees WILL keep noise down to a low conversational level. At no time will a detainee be allowed to yell or become unruly. At no time will detainees communicate across block areas. </p> <p>It is perhaps the last rule which is the most sinister: </p> <p>13. US Security Forces RESERVE THE RIGHT to alter or temporarily cease the above standards if necessary. </p> <p>Gitmo's public affairs spokesman will not disclose the details of the 'strict punishment' threatened in the document's preamble. However, it has now emerged that ERF deployments have all been videotaped, and in July the Pentagon told the Associated Press that 'only 32 hours' of these tapes revealed 'excessive force'. </p> <p>Although they maintain that the 'unlawful combatants' at Guant\u00e1namo do not deserve the protection of the Geneva Conventions, President Bush and Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld have repeatedly claimed that the regime at Camp Delta is nevertheless 'consistent with Geneva's principles'. </p> <p>In these secret rules, as in much else, Guant\u00e1namo is, in fact, in flagrant breach of this fundamental piece of international law. If one sought to construct and manage a prison camp with Geneva as a blueprint, it would be not resemble Camp Delta in any significant way. Detainees would, for example, be able to move freely within a secure perimeter and, instead of being locked in tiny cells for 24 hours a day, would largely organise their own lives. </p> <p>According to the conventions' article 21: 'The detaining Power may subject prisoners of war to internment. It may impose on them the obligation of not leaving ... the camp where they are interned, or if the said camp is fenced in, of not going outside its perimeter.' </p> <p>Under Article 96, 'Before any disciplinary award is pronounced, the accused shall be given precise information regarding the offences of which he is accused, and given an opportunity of explaining his conduct and of defending himself. He shall be permitted ... to call witnesses and to have recourse, if necessary, to the services of a qualified interpreter.' Needless to say, at Guant\u00e1namo, there have been no such hearings.</p>",
  "American warnings that Darfur is heading for an apocalyptic humanitarian catastrophe have been widely exaggerated by administration officials, it is alleged by international aid workers in Sudan. Washington's desire for a regime change in Khartoum has biased their reports, it is claimed. <p>The government's aid agency, USAID, says that between 350,000 and a million people could die in Darfur by the end of the year. Other officials, including Secretary of State Colin Powell, have accused the Sudanese government of presiding over a 'genocide' that could rival those in Bosnia and Rwanda. </p> <p>But the account has been comprehensively challenged by eyewitness reports from aid workers and by a new food survey of the region. The nutritional survey of Sudan's Darfur region, by the UN World Food Programme, says that although there are still high levels of malnutrition among under-fives in some areas, the crisis is being brought under control. </p> <p>'It's not disastrous,' said one of those involved in the WFP survey, 'although it certainly was a disaster earlier this year, and if humanitarian assistance declines, this will have very serious negative consequences.' </p> <p>The UN report appears to confirm food surveys conducted by other agencies in Darfur which also stand in stark contrast to the dire US descriptions of the food crisis. </p> <p>The most dramatic came from Andrew Natsios, head of USAID, who told UN officials: 'We estimate right now, if we get relief in we'll lose a third of a million people and, if we don't, the death rates could be dramatically higher, approaching a million people.' </p> <p>A month later, a second senior official, Roger Winter, USAID's assistant administrator, briefed foreign journalists in Washington that an estimated 30,000 people had been killed during the on-going crisis in Darfur, with another 50,000 deaths from malnutrition and disease, largely among the huge populations fleeing the violence. He described the emergency as 'humanitarian disaster of the first magnitude'. </p> <p>By 9 September Powell was in front of the Congressional Foreign Relations Committee accusing Sudan of 'genocide', a charge rejected by officials of both the European and African Unions and also privately by British officials. </p> <p>'I've been to a number of camps during my time here,' said one aid worker, 'and if you want to find death, you have to go looking for it. It's easy to find very sick and under-nourished children at the therapeutic feeding centres, but that's the same wherever you go in Africa.' </p> <p>Another aid worker told The Observer : 'It suited various governments to talk it all up, but they don't seem to have thought about the consequences. I have no idea what Colin Powell's game is, but to call it genocide and then effectively say, \"Oh, shucks, but we are not going to do anything about that genocide\" undermines the very word \"genocide\".' </p> <p>While none of the aid workers and officials interviewed by The Observer denied there was a crisis in Darfur - or that killings, rape and a large-scale displacement of population had taken place - many were puzzled that it had become the focus of such hyperbolic warnings when there were crises of similar magnitude in both northern Uganda and eastern Congo. </p> <p>Concern about USAID's role as an honest broker in Darfur have been mounting for months, with diplomats as well as aid workers puzzled over its pronouncements and one European diplomat accusing it of 'plucking figures from the air'. </p> <p>Under the Bush administration, the work of USAID has become increasingly politicised. But over Sudan, in particular, two of its most senior officials have long held strong personal views. Both Natsios, a former vice-president of the Christian charity World Vision, and Winter have long been hostile to the Sudanese government.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Die Familie Schneider</strong><br> Whitechapel, east London </p> <p>You pick up your keys to Die Familie Schneider from an office just off Whitechapel Road in the East End of London. You walk down a street full of children's clothing manufacturers, with signs in English and Bangladeshi, round the back of the Victorian Royal London Hospital, to a derelict terrace of two-up, two-downs. Most of the houses are boarded up with metal grilles. The two adjacent houses to which you have keys have net curtains at the windows and dirty brown front doors. You let yourself into the first one. </p> <p>There is a dimly lit narrow hallway, old brown carpet, stained walls, a sickly smell you cannot quite identify. All the doors are closed, but you have the sense of not being alone. You go into a kitchen in which a woman dressed in brown is vacantly washing up. She betrays no sense of you being there, keeps at work on her plates. You cough. Through a beaded curtain, in a tiny front room, there are cigarette butts in an ashtray, a bag of shopping from a convenience store, some destitute chairs, a couple of TV guides. The walls are nicotine stained, the smell sweet and stagnant. </p> <p>Back in the kitchen you try to lighten the mood, you offer to dry the dishes. The woman does not look round. You wonder how all this differs from a fairground haunted house and then you realise you are the ghost. You think about tapping the woman on the shoulder. Instead, you open the fridge, out of interest, and find a single jar of pickled cucumbers. You walk up the narrow stairs and are confronted with two other doors. You open the first one, not by now without a degree of trepidation. The room smells of old towels and hairspray. It is a bathroom and there is a shower dribbling over the bath and in the shower a naked, balding man with his back to you is masturbating with some urgency. </p> <p>You watch his back for a bit. You can't think of anything to say and anyhow he seems in a world of his own. You slip out and close the door, wander into a bedroom next door, with old shag pile carpets and grimy sheets and a foul sheepskin rug. In one corner there is a baby changing mat leaning against a wall, in the other a bin bag, in which, you realise, someone is sitting quite still. You go back out, unnerved maybe, now really hating the smell. </p> <p>You peer round the bathroom door and check the man is still wanking. He is. You go downstairs and discover there is a cellar, which is hardly lit. You know this is all here for you, that it's art and quite safe and so on, but you don't fancy it much. Still, you go down. In the gloom of one room there is an overturned chair and sacks of rubbish or whatever rotting. In the other, a sad stack of iced cakes. You go back upstairs, past the woman washing up and let yourself out into the air. </p> <p>And then, inevitably you try the key in the next door, in which you find everything is exactly the same, the smell, the stains the woman washing up - a twin, you hope - the man in the shower, a little hairier than his counterpart, toiling away vigorously, the person squatting in the binliner. You would like to think that familiarity makes this funnier, or less strange, but it doesn't, quite. </p> <p>Your 20 minutes is up, which is a relief, so you let yourself out. You pass the next person wandering up the street clutching their keys. You wonder what to write in your notebook. </p> <p>In the end, standing outside a shop selling second-hand wheelchairs, you write that you fear a little for the German artist Gregor Schneider who created these houses, who stained the walls and created the smells and auditioned the masturbators. That, though you quite like the idea of it, you have no particular desire to visit Schneider's lifelong project, Dead House ur, in Germany, in which, over a period of 20 years, he has transformed the interior of this childhood home into a series of insulated tunnels and rooms within rooms, all of which he once shipped to the Venice Biennale. That you love the idea of Artangel, who funded this London project. That the houses make you think about public and private spaces, and about death, a bit. That the smell seems to have lingered in your shirt and on your skin. That you wouldn't want to be there much after dark. That all houses maybe carry the residue of past loneliness, and worse. That you felt you hadn't really been there, somehow. And that you must repaint your bathroom. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To book a visit, call 07981 578754 or 07981 578755; <a href=\"http://www.artangel.org.uk\">www.artangel.org.uk</a></p>",
  "A series of unauthorised attempts to free two French journalists held hostage in Iraq for more than six weeks have caused acute embarrassment for President Jacques Chirac and may have jeopardised official negotiations for their release. <p>Confusion surrounds the rescue mission launched independently by a maverick politician from Chirac's own ruling UMP party, Didier Julia, and his envoy Philip Brett, a former security guard for the extreme-right National Front movement. On Friday they promised that the journalists were about to be freed, but yesterday there was still no sign of them. </p> <p>Chirac expressed 'anxiety' about this freelance initiative and said he hoped it would not have a 'negative effect' on the Foreign Ministry's parallel efforts to save Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot and their Syrian driver Mohamed al-Joundi. </p> <p>However, the highly publicised nature of the rival negotiations have underlined the failure of the French diplomatic efforts to extract the journalists from Iraq, despite early optimism about the prospects of a swift release. </p> <p>The private attempt to save Chesnot and Malbrunot, who were seized on 20 August, has been characterised by extravagant claims. Julia, an active campaigner for the lifting of sanctions on Iraq in the 1990s, was so confident of an imminent rescue on Friday afternoon that hotel rooms were booked for them in Damascus. </p> <p>Julia blamed the failure of the mission on the lack of co-operation from the American forces, who he claimed had done much more to facilitate the release earlier last week of the two hostages from Italy, a supporter of the US-led campaign in Iraq. </p> <p>He alleged that the US had intensified its bombardment of the area where the hostages were held soon after his announcement of their imminent liberation. It had been impossible to flee the region because US forces had erected 20 new roadblocks along their escape route, he said. </p> <p>Julia's claims have been met with some scepticism in France. The Foreign Ministry refused to comment, but a US military spokesman in Iraq denied the claim. </p> <p>Brett is a former chauffeur and security guard for Bruno Gollnisch, deputy leader of the National Front, which was sympathetic to Saddam Hussein. There was uncertainty about how Brett, who was close to the former Baathist regime, had got access to the original hostage-takers, a militant group calling themselves the Islamic Army of Iraq. Brett said on Friday that the journalists had been passed to a more secular group, which was prepared to release them. Hostages are frequently trafficked among groups in Iraq but rarely from religious to less religious groups. The original kidnappers demanded that France revoke legislation banning Islamic headscarves from schools. </p> <p>In Iraq, however, there is increasing anger about the huge attention paid to foreign hostages while hundreds of locals are being abducted. More than 100 Iraqi doctors have been kidnapped or killed since the fall of Saddam's regime, official figures released last week reveal. Hundreds more have fled overseas, seriously weakening efforts to reconstruct the dilapidated healthcare system. </p> <p>Mohammed al-Hassouni, director of a unit at the Ministry of Health dedicated to protecting medical staff against violence, said it was planning to give doctors armed bodyguards and security training. He said he feared that the danger could lead many of the country's best scientific minds to leave the country. </p> <p>The threat is continually evolving. In one recent development, pharmacists and university professors are also being targeted, with ransoms of up to $50,000 demanded. </p> <p>Several doctors were interviewed by The Observer but none was willing to be named. 'I'm terrified, but what can I do?' said one. 'You look to the government for protection, but know they can't help. At least the kidnappers are unlikely to kill you. You'll just be left a bankrupt.' </p> <p>Some have been targeted by insurgents set on disrupting reconstruction. However, Yahia Saeed, an Iraq specialist at the London School of Economics, said that 90 percent of the kidnapping was 'criminal'. </p> <p>'There has been an explosion in the crime,' he said, while stressing that abductions had taken place under Saddam. 'As sanctions began to bite in the Nineties, there was an explosion in criminality and criminal gangs connected to the increasingly fragmented regime often targeted businessmen.' </p> <p>Now, Saeed pointed out, it is not simply doctors but all successful people who are at risk. 'Prominent academics, doctors, merchants - and especially their children - are all vulnerable,' he said. </p> <p>Al-Hassouni said that a group of kidnappers had recently been broken up by police but that convicting the criminals was hard because no victims wanted to give witness statements. He planned to ask senior clerics to issue appeals not to abduct medical staff. 'What are the kidnappers going to do if they fall ill?' he said.</p>",
  "<p>Australian-born media mogul Rupert Murdoch could have dug one of the bigger holes of his corporate life if investors block his bid to quit Australia through the creation of a new US-based News Corporation. </p> <p>The move would transfer control of 70 per cent of the nation's newspapers to a foreign company. </p> <p>It is a measure of Murdoch's clout Down Under that in the midst of one of the most tightly fought Australian federal election campaigns in decades there has been barely a whimper from politicians about the pending departure of News Corporation from the Australian stock market. </p> <p>The lack of political debate could also be reassuring for the handful of media interests that dominate Australia's electronic media. </p> <p>They are expected to make another push for the new government to reconsider cross-ownership rules, particularly for pay television and the granting of a new free-to-air television licence. </p> <p>Opposition to News Corporation's relocation is coming from minority shareholders, who are concerned about what it means for their rights, and fund managers worried about short-term pressure on the share price and the effect on the Australian stock exchange of the departure of its largest member. </p> <p>The objections have brought Lachlan Murdoch, tattooed scion of the Murdoch empire, scurrying back to Australia from New York to face critics and stop the opposition growing. </p> <p>'In order to get the benefit of the change in domicile we have to be an American company, like it or not. It has been an emotional decision but we have to become an American company,' he told the Australian press last week. </p> <p>Analysts in favour of the move argue that, as some 70 per cent of the group's revenues come from the US, it makes sense to seek access to the world's deepest capital pool by moving to Delaware. </p> <p>Murdoch's Australian newspapers have also been conspicuously enthusiastic about the deal, earning them a sarcastic blessing as the 'cardinals of the Murdoch pontificate'. </p> <p>An international coalition of advisers to major superannuation (pension) funds representing more than A$1 trillion (\u00a3392 billion) is expected to tell members to vote against the measure at next month's shareholder meeting. </p> <p>'We are surprised that News Corp is asking investors to endorse a proposal that will effectively diminish governance standards, given that we have just come out of a cycle of collapses and failures attributed to poor corporate governance,' said Michael O'Sullivan, president of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI). </p> <p>'With its preoccupation with looking and smelling like a US company, News Corporation has effectively missed an opportunity to smell like roses on governance issues.' </p> <p>While preference shareholders are believed to favour the deal, News Corp is believed to be just short of the 75 per cent approval of holders of ordinary shares required for next month's meeting. </p> <p>The high concentration of media ownership within a handful of players, such as Murdoch and Australia's richest man, Kerry Packer, owner of listed Publishing and Broadcasting (PBL), means the right deal regularly turns rivals intopartners. </p> <p>In recent months, the leader of the federal opposition, Mark Latham, has been invited for a meal at Cavan, the Murdoch family's rural property in New South Wales, with Lachlan and local News Corp chief John Hartigan. </p> <p>One of the topics on the menu was what a future Labour government might do with its half-share in the pay television monopoly in Australia held by telecom giant Telstra (the remainder is split between the Murdoch family and Packer's PBL). </p> <p>The Murdochs and Packers are determined to wrest control of pay television from the government but have conflicting ambitions over a possible fourth free-to-air television network. </p> <p>Australia is the only major market in the world where Murdoch's expansion into the electronic media has been largely blocked by rules prohibit ing the ownership of TV and print media in the same market. </p> <p>Attempts to have those rules changed will be aggressively opposed by rival networks fearful that News Corporation's Hollywood hit factories will dominate the airwaves. </p> <p>It is 20 years since Murdoch, by then an American citizen, raised the political heat by grabbing Australia's leading newspaper group, the Herald and Weekly Times. There was outrage that his domination of print media has left only one other group, John Fairfax Ltd, publishers of the nation's leading broadsheets in Melbourne and Sydney, as a major player. </p> <p>As with News Corp, Fairfax's extensive newspaper interests in Australia and New Zealand inhibit a push into television under current regulation. Given this, there is widespread speculation that the group is planning a bid for the major newspaper in Western Australia. But revenues of the group's flagship capital city newspapers have been hurt by the impact of the internet on classified advertising. </p> <p>'They are the only ones, in my view, that are clearly vulnerable to the better mouse trap that has come along, which is internet classified advertising', says Eric Beecher, former editor-in-chief of the Herald and Weekly Times. </p> <p>' The most vulnerable newspapers are the ones that commit the greatest resources to journalism. It is going to have a devastating effect on the kind of journalism those newspapers can support in the future,' he said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Asian edition of the Financial Times has recently conducted a low-profile launch in Australia. </p> <p>Given that the 'pink'un' is selling at nearly twice the cover charge of its local rival, the Australian Financial Review, and confusingly still has a syndication deal that allows the Australian, the only national newspaper, to run the FT's best stories each day, this is perhaps not surprising. </p> <p>But, as so often, it is the outcome of a Murdoch initiative - and the vote on 26 October - that dominates the Australian media agenda.</p>",
  "'I couldn't get the bank job I wanted. When my father died I took his job as a sweeper' <p>Flanked by green cricket fields where he once played and a university from which he graduated, Arvind Vaghela tries not to notice the stream of students walking past. 'I used to be like them, attending lectures and going out on the fields. But now I just hide my face,' he said. </p> <p>The reason for his shame is the broom in his hand. Despite a masters degree in economics from Gujarat University in Ahmedabad, the best job Vaghela, 24, could get was one done by generations of his family: roadsweeper. </p> <p>'I wanted to work in sales for a bank, but you needed to have your own vehicle. I come from a poor family, so how could I afford that? When my father died I was offered his job and I took it,' he said. As a Dalit, or untouchable, Vaghela's story is familiar in this sprawling west Indian city. Nearly 100 of its council sanitation workers have degrees in subjects ranging from computing to law, but cannot get better jobs because they are Dalits. </p> <p>Their experience is part of an increasingly heated debate in India, where the government has announced that it will consider extending public-sector job quotas for people from the lowest castes to the private sector. </p> <p>Industrialists, who insist private-sector jobs and promotions are earned on merit, say that this will make businesses inefficient and uncompetitive. </p> <p>Rahul Bajaj, who chairs a large motorcycle manufacturer, wrote in the Times of India that public-sector job quotas had reduced the 'effectiveness of government' because decisions were not made on the basis of ability. </p> <p>This argument leaves Ahmedabad's roadsweeping graduates unimpressed. Most say that they have had to face discrimination or exploitation in the booming private sector. </p> <p>'I got a job with a firm of accountants and then had to present my qualifications. On one school certificate it mentioned my caste. </p> <p>'The next day I was told there had been a mistake - I was not required any more,' said Dalit sweeper Prakash Chauhan, 32, who has a a degree in commerce. </p> <p>Chauhan stresses he is relatively well paid, at 4,000 rupees (\u00a350) a month, and his job is secure.'This is a job for life. But it was my father's life. Our parents had a dream that education would mean we would not have to do the jobs they did. It did not turn out that way.' </p> <p>Dalits, the lowest caste, have endured centuries of discrimination and violence because of a social order that consigns them and their descendants to jobs nobody else wants to do and a tradition that all humans are created unequal. </p> <p>In rural India Dalits have been murdered for proposing to marry somebody further up the social ladder, barred from temples, forced into bonded labour and made to carry human waste from the homes of high-caste Hindus. </p> <p>In the cities, where it is easier to change one's name and slip into the crowd, Dalits say economic exclusion is now the biggest issue. </p> <p>The ingrained unfairness of the caste system has brought pressure for reform on human rights grounds against Western firms doing business in India. Unions have written to 300 companies in Europe which outsource work to India to check that their subcontractors do not discriminate on the basis of caste. </p> <p>'There are many parallels with the situation in South Africa in the Sixties, when foreign companies needed to be persuaded to address the discrimination in the system of apartheid,' said David Haslam, the London-based chair of the Dalit Solidarity Network. </p> <p>Chandra Bhan Prasad, a Dalit writer who has proposed many new affirmative action programmes in India, says businesses should look for inspiration to the United States, where firms carry out diversity audits and give contracts to firms from minority groups. </p> <p>'About a fifth of General Motors managers are African American, Hispanic or Native American. GM actually goes out of its way to recruit from these communities. The company also places $2 billion of business into the minority communities. No Indian business has done the same.' </p> <p>These measures helped to create a black middle class, he says, making African Americans part of mainstream life in the US. By contrast, Prasad says, if Oprah Winfrey had been born in India she would have remained chained to poverty rather than become one of the world's richest women. </p> <p>'Here family connections and caste matter more than ability. It is still the case of who you know, not what you can do. </p> <p>'In the US you have black billionaires, industrialists, black film stars, black professors. In India university professorships are closed to us. We do not have one Dalit millionaire. There is not one Dalit newspaper editor, nor a Dalit newscaster.' </p> <p>Academics caution, however, that there is one big difference between race and Indian caste. 'No one can tell from your appearance that you are a Dalit. The same cannot be said for African Americans,' says Shyam Babu, a research fellow at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute, a think-tank in New Delhi. </p> <p>'It is more subtle. Once you know someone's name and where they are from, most Indians can identify your caste. The basic bigotry is the same: you assume an entire ethnic group is incompetent.'</p>",
  "<p>When the moment finally came, I have to say I was touched. It was about 10.50pm, near the end of a Friday show on Radio 1, after the usual aural assault from Ludacris and G-Unit and Kanye West, when Tim Westwood said, 'I want to big up my man Simon at The Observer - we're travelling with a journalist tonight because we're BIG like that!' I felt honoured, but I tried to be cool, like I knew it was coming all along and it was no big thing, concealing my crushing true belief that I would be leaving yet another Westwood show without a mention.</p> <p>Up to this moment, it seemed that everyone else in the whole of Britain had been acknowledged. All the crews and clans, 'my Eastbourne crew, Dave and the Big Knob Crew in Scotland, Drash in Bolton I GOT ya! Shout out to my man Trevor Nelson who really showed me mad love in hooking me up with that Fifty show. I want to big up my team Tuan and Dre and Anna. Come on let's GO! To all our freaky LADIES...'</p> <p>I was pleased to be included in a show that had included the phrases 'Bow down and kiss the RING', 'underSTAND this!' and 'ZACTLY! Without the E!' - that strange urban lexicon that has brought as much ridicule as respect, dispensed by a white man who speaks like a black kid, standing up aggressively at the microphone, hitting a touch-screen to unleash sound effects of screeching cars and exploding bombs. 'Fall back,' he says. 'Kiss the ring. Damn, that's the way it's going down. We're riding out tonight. Fall back. We're coming to Club M in Luton tonight. Luton come party with Westwood!'</p> <p>An hour later, he sits in a van emblazoned with his face and logos and show times, on his way to a club where denim and trainers are permitted but no hoods or caps, guided there by satnav and all manner of toys and gadgets and DVD screens that fall from the roof to show the latest American car shows. Westwood talks about his new satellite television programme, and his plans to attend a memorial for a young black friend. He talks about the possibility of getting a manager now that things are getting so busy. </p> <p>'I tell you, man, things are crazy right now,' he says. 'People said that hip-hop was a phase, but this is 2004 and we have the hip-hop generation. </p> <p>People used to hate us, but now it's a multi-million-dollar industry. It's always been a struggle, but now I'm ready. I'm built for it.' </p> <p>Westwood - mid-forties though he says he's 27, heavy eyelids and tidy black hair - is the foremost hip-hop DJ in Europe, a position he's held for almost 20 years, practically since hip-hop was invented. Meeting him at his Justice Entertainment office in Portland Square, one encounters a tall and powerful man concerned with standard creative business matters: delivery dates, emails, future engagements. Everywhere I go there are framed Sony Radio Awards. He tells me he used to be envious when he saw how frantic things were for his DJ friend Funkmaster Flex in New York, and how hard it is to get work or respect or money in London, but how things have changed.</p> <p>'This office is all about making it happen,' he explains. 'My dad would always ask me how it's going, and for about 15 years I would say to him, \"I'm just trying to make it happen.\" Then he would keep on asking, \"When is it going to happen?\" Truthfully, I think it's happening right now.'</p> <p>When he speaks he does not sound like he does on the radio, and he does not wave his arms. 'It's a Wednesday lunchtime,' he observes. 'It's a different vibe with a different energy level. You wouldn't want me sitting here going, \"Yeah, man! This is how it's going DOWN!\" If I'm with my mother I might do my belt up a little tighter and not have my trousers hanging down and drop the swearing, but I'm still me. I'll just change the tempo. But if I'm hanging out with Dre in a club tonight, sure my trousers will be hanging down, sure we'll be kicking it.'</p> <p>On this Wednesday lunchtime, Dre, Westwood's 20-year-old personal assistant, is just on his way to get the cappuccinos. 'You got dough, man?' Westwood asks him. 'This is show business,' he says when Dre has gone. 'People don't want to listen to the show and it be mad fucking straight. It's a hip-hop show, they want some realness in there. That's where a lot of BBC television always fails - they always want that middle-class explanation.' I ask Westwood about his detractors, those who call him a whigger - a white nigger - and he says he rarely meets them. 'The way I speak is the way a lot of kids speak now,' Westwood says. 'All cities are multicultural. The racial issue has never been something I've been very much aware of - I'm so involved with the audience, and they've always known me, and it's never an issue if I'm white or black.' The phone rings. It is his mother, to whom he speaks softly, as if in a secret pact. 'When I started in this game all the other DJs would hate me,' he resumes. 'This is not an easy game to make it in.'</p> <p>Personally, I love the way he speaks, and the passion he brings. Rather than ridicule him, hip-hop artists love him, not least because he was the only man who gave them airtime when they were starting out. After a recent appearance on his Radio 1 show, Jay-Z affirmed that 'Westwood has held me down from day one, Westwood is family - we've grown up together.' 50 Cent came to see a Westwood show in New York earlier this year. 'He's in tune with what's going on over here, even though he's all the way over there,' 50 Cent informed Mixmag. 'So when he calls, I'm going to come out especially.' </p> <p>Westwood says he'd soon know if they thought he looked foolish. 'If I do a club and I'm on until two, I'm not going to disappear at five past two,' he says. </p> <p>'I ain't built for that. I'll be there hanging out. The next day we might go for something to eat in the local hood spot or a little American clothing spot and hang out. Everyone's got a story about meeting me, or their friends meeting me. There's always relentless Westwood stories out there.' </p> <p>This is his 10th year at Radio 1, and about 600,000 listen to each show. Matthew Bannister, the station's former controller, told me that when he was constructing a new credible image for the network, all the research said that he would have to recruit Westwood. The DJ was at Capital earning \u00a335 a show, and was originally reluctant to move. 'They sent Pete Tong to offer me the job,' he remembers. 'And I thought, \"Anything Pete's offering me I'm going to say no to.\" And then I spoke to my dad about it, and a friend, and they said I should go and meet Matthew just out of respect.' </p> <p>Bannister assured Westwood that the DJ was the epitome of the public service broadcaster. 'He didn't want to be seen to sell out by going to a national radio station. But this was his real home.' As a show of independence, Westwood was told he could make the show with his own production company. When he agreed to move, Biggie Smalls and Puff Daddy held a launch party for him at Hammersmith Palais. Not long afterwards, Bannister took him to have drinks with the then director-general John Birt. 'Westwood and Birt got on like a house on fire,' Bannister recalls. 'Westwood came out saying, \"I really love working for him! He's my man!\"'</p> <p>He probably felt at home with authority. His father was the Right Reverend William John Westwood, Bishop of Peterborough, but Tim believes this title has led to some misunderstanding. 'When my father did so well and lived in the Palace and had a chaplain driving him around in a Rover, I didn't grow up with that. My dad was from very humble means. His mother was one of 16 children and his dad was one of 17 children.' </p> <p>His father went to Cambridge before the war, and after that went to Hull as a curate, which is where he met Westwood's mother and where his older sister was born. Tim grew up in Lowestoft, and moved to Norwich at the age of eight when his father became a vicar. He went to church and enjoyed a loving upbringing, but there were problems at his comprehensive. 'I was dyslexic, and people didn't really know what that was. They used to do these weekly spelling tests, and for nearly six years I was always second from bottom, getting one out of 20. Then the kid who was bottom left, and I was bottom. I went for special schooling, but dyslexia was murder for me.' I ask him about his ambitions at that time. 'Nah, I was worthless, man. I was clueless at work and poor at sports. My dad would have been happy had I become a butcher. A kid at school became a butcher and my dad said, \"That's a good job, Tim.\"'</p> <p>His father died a few years after he retired, in 1996. The DJ says they were equally proud of each other, especially as they were both self-made. Westwood shielded him from the details of his first forays into the London scene when he was 16. He was a glass collector at Gossips in Soho, and would earn 30-minute warm-up slots on the record decks by bringing in 50 people from Hammersmith and Ladbroke Grove. He was paid \u00a315, and his earnings increased when a regular DJ quit. Initially he played jazz-funk, but occasionally a new rap record arrived from New York: 'Rappers Delight' by the Sugarhill Gang, 'The Message' by Grandmaster Flash &amp; the Furious Five, 'The Show' by Doug E Fresh.</p> <p>'I knew that was me as soon as it started,' Westwood says, 'but then dance music came in - house music - and all those guys who jumped on the hip-hop bandwagon just jumped straight off. Like Dave Pearce and Pete Tong \u00ad- they were straight into dance music because that's where the dough was and the big crowds.'</p> <p>Westwood also had a Thursday-night slot at People's Club in Praed Street, where Run-DMC would drop in when they were homesick. 'It was the hot crazy ghetto spot, a lot of prostitutes and pimps, you could only buy champagne or brandy by the bottle. It used to start about midnight. Cars would triple-park outside. If you wanted a piss you had to go outside, because the toilets were just for drug dealing.' Westwood was inspired by the club DJ Paul Anderson, and the success of reggae specialist David Rodigan on Capital Radio, and he was keen to join him when Richard Park offered him an early-morning show in the mid-Eighties. It was a token gesture, he says; when he arrived at Radio 1 seven years later he was amazed that people at the station took an interest in what he played. </p> <p>Partly this was due to language. Even at the illest end of Saturday night, BBC governors and the Daily Mail didn't take kindly to the casual use of the word 'motherfucker', and the DJ says he understands their concerns. 'I play the game. I can respect that you don't want it too grimy. I can then put out those grimy tapes and CDs for cats who are built for it. It's important for cats to hear me swear so that they know I'm real, that I'm not just some corny radio DJ. Or that I'm not some personality type. Because for me it's all music-based, and people need to know I'm real.' </p> <p>One of the ways he keeps it real is through his street teams, scattered around the UK, who promote Westwood live events (his 'parties') and feed back to him the latest trends. 'My whole thing is I haven't got family, I don't want that in my life,' Westwood says. 'But I'm being a father to some of my team. Dre nearly didn't come through - a lot of cats don't survive, they get gassed up or twisted and don't understand how hungry you've got to be. Jay-Z gave me his number and Dre lost it so he's under a bit of pressure from me.'</p> <p>Dre lives in Peckham and keeps his employer informed on the content of the latest mix-tapes at the Real McCoy, the local clothes shop. </p> <p>Others in the street team blitz areas with flyers advertising Westwood's upcoming live appearances. Westwood says his parties don't make much money - \u00a38 to get in, with 'the ladies' usually admitted free - but often he will print 40,000 leaflets for the show, on the back of which are his radio schedules and details of his latest album. </p> <p>The street teams also offer an element of protection. In July 1999, he was with his London team as they pulled away from a show at Brockwell Park when their van got stuck behind a bus in Kennington. A couple on a motorcycle pulled alongside and a man riding pillion shot at them, hitting Westwood in the arm and a friend in the leg. Instantly, the DJ's celebrity widened. Five years later he is still wary of talking about it, and the threat may not have disappeared. The cause of the shooting was extortion, Westwood refusing to meet a gang's demands. Before the incident, both he and his girlfriend were beaten. On the record, he plays it cool: 'To be honest, my attitude towards it is, I got shot, and that's that. Like having a car accident. When you're in this game, these things are out there; never far from you.'</p> <p>I wondered whether he thought of lowering his profile, perhaps painting over his name and logos on his transport? 'No. I'm a DJ, man. Radio 1 wouldn't be keen if I got stopped in a car with people carrying guns. I do parties, man. I need everyone to know I'm going to be there or the parties will be empty. Before the shooting, the only people who knew me were the hip-hop crowd. It made me big! I wish I had an album out at that time!'</p> <p>The police suggested he might like to get an anonymous black BMW 5-Series, but Westwood went the other way. 'The police were saying \"Lo-pro\", but I stepped up my game. I worked harder than I ever worked before. I was ready. I ain't scared of nothing.'</p> <p>In addition to his customised promotional van, Westwood owns a GMC Yukon, a Suburban Chevrolet, a GMC Suburban with TV screens, and a classic Chevy Impala 1966. The cars are his main expense: until recently he lived in a tiny housing association flat, and he doesn't spend much money on clothes - a fat wristwatch his only concession to bling. Like others in his industry with humble origins and a conscience, he does like to give something back. He is the patron of the radio station at Feltham Young Offenders Institution, where he holds regular high-testosterone parties. He says the next one will take place one morning in the chapel, so he'll probably play the edited radio versions of songs. He will then tour the wings. 'I don't pre-judge, man. I came from a good family that kept my life smooth, but any of us could have made mistakes and ended up in there. One guy I was with at the station, his mother's in prison, his father's in prison, his sister's in prison, and his two older brothers are in prison. The dude was just waiting to go to prison. At 17, he got sentenced to 18 years mandatory. With those guys it's good to be there. I'm no hero to them, but as a radio dude I'm paying them some attention.'</p> <p>He finds that the people he meets just want stories about the artists. 'I tell them I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't get high, so I'm pretty focused and I love what I do. I tell them that a lot of artists who are mad grimy don't actually smoke weed - 50 doesn't smoke weed, Jay-Z doesn't smoke weed.'</p> <p>I asked Westwood whether he thought hip-hop could change anything. 'Not really. The world made hip-hop, hip-hop didn't make the world. My father's generation came back from the war and believed that everything was possible, but I don't think that's true any more.'</p> <p>We are nearing Luton in the van. Westwood is flipping between DVDs and CDs on the complex entertainment system, saying, 'You gotta watch this!' as some rapper or flash car comes up. He is like a 12-year-old boy let loose for the first time; the reason he is such a good DJ is that he is such a good fan. As we pull up at the club, he is swiftly inside to arrange security for his guests. He embraces everyone he meets, one of five white faces out of a thousand, and the only one to climb up to the slim DJ platform at the front of the narrow room. He has a torch in his mouth as he lines up his opening records, and the warm-up DJ slinks away with a defeated look. It is 12.20am. Westwood says, 'Let's fucking ride out to THIS! We got the prime fucking JOINTS! Let's GO! This is WESTWOOD! All you other DJs FALL BACK!' And everyone in the crowd looks delighted and blessed, as if they've just been anointed with holy water.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tim Westwood is on Radio 1, Fridays and Saturdays from 9pm</p>",
  "The case of Charlotte Wyatt has no parallel. Never in memory has a British judge presided, in open session, over a debate on whether a child should live or die. Court 47 of the Royal Courts of Justice, a prosaic forum for god-like edict, is a modern room so large that Mr Justice Hedley had to tell witnesses to project their answers to the back row in order to be heard. <p>An array of doctors, known only by their initials, testified to the misery of Charlotte's life. Born at 26 weeks, she weighed 458 grams and measured a pencil's length. Almost a year on, her brain is undeveloped, her heart and lungs are damaged and she has been resuscitated several times. Her consultants, adamant that a dying child should not be made to suffer any more, are seeking high court permission to let her die next time her breathing fails. </p> <p>Sometimes, Dr E told the court, Charlotte's suffering reached 'an unbearable level'. Her emotional responses, though vestigial, allowed her 'to have anguish on her face, to writhe around, to cry out'. Charlotte's parents listened, their faces weary and impassive, as if they could not recognise their child in this account. To Darren and Debbie Wyatt, Charlotte is 'a fighter' whose recovery is in God's hands. </p> <p>Darren Wyatt has three older children from his first marriage, as well as a toddler son with Debbie, who is pregnant again. Most days, the Wyatts visit the hospital room where their daughter lies in an oxygenated box, surrounded by musical toys and pictures of Jesus. Pleading for his daughter's life, Mr Wyatt told the court that the baby could grasp his finger and recognise her parents. 'When you grow to love someone, you can't just throw them away,' he told the court. Did he believe that life should be preserved at all costs? Mr Wyatt replied that he did. </p> <p>Though the judge several times invoked the medical nostrum 'Never say never', all professional evidence indicated that Charlotte Wyatt was a child born into Neverland. Her portraits show a girl of 11 months, with the doll's limbs of a tiny infant and a face as old as time. Few could have listened to the evidence in Court 47 without hoping that she may die in peace. </p> <p>Cases such as Charlotte's are always portrayed as impossible dilemmas, but they are the easy ones. The law has bridged the gulf between parental rights and duties before, forbidding the parents of the conjoined twins, Mary and Jodie, to let both their daughters die when one could be saved. In the case of Re J, hinging on circumstances similar to Charlotte's, the appeal court ruled in 1990 that a sick baby should not be placed on a mechanical ventilator.</p> <p>Jurisprudence has established a marker between imposing an outcome and failing to avert it. It appears likely, if not certain, that Mr Justice Hedley, whatever his sympathy for the Wyatt parents, will allow Charlotte to die by omission.</p> <p>If the law seems clear, then public thinking on life and death gets murkier. Last month's Panorama programme, based on a tracking study, showed disturbing outcomes for babies born before 26 weeks. Of the 1,200 infants delivered alive in the UK and Ireland between March and December 1995, 314 survived to go home. Of those, 40 per cent had moderate to severe problems with cognitive development at six years of age. </p> <p>That leaves out of account the 60 per cent of survivors who are effectively perfect, and the parents who would have made no other choice, however disabled their child. But it also crushes the myth of marvels. Modern medicine can keep babies alive at increasingly young ages, but it cannot guarantee their health. This imbalance has been glossed over for too long by a society primed to think that death is always the worst result. </p> <p>Sanctity of life is not simply the mantra of a religious right that detects souls in stem cells and clamours for late abortions to be banned. Humanists also risk prizing survival at any cost too highly. Death, in an era of optional wrinkles and deferred old age, is seen as an aberration on the part of medicine or the human spirit. And so life gets prolonged, sometimes beyond the point of reason or mercy, for as long as drugs and science can prevail. </p> <p>Surveys show that 80 per cent of people want euthanasia legalised, but Lord Joffe's bill sanctioning assisted death will not reach the statute book, even though British doctors are helping nearly 20,000 people a year to end their lives. Those who choose the time of their dying are the lucky ones. A friend who died recently endured months in which her life became dull, undignified and finally unbearable. 'I want them to switch me off,' she wrote, after she could no longer speak, but there were no shortcuts. Nature, too clumsy or brutal to be relied on in the management of life, remains the primary ordinant of death. </p> <p>For very early babies, as for adults condemned to terminal illness, false hope sometimes eclipses reason. Of the 40,000 British infants born prematurely each year, almost 37,000 are delivered after 28 weeks, with a high chance of an entirely normal life. </p> <p>At 26 weeks, babies heavier and healthier than Charlotte Wyatt have good chances, too, and those of 22 weeks can survive. Doctors keep ever tinier children alive, but experts worry that there has been no corresponding leap forward in ensuring healthy lives for them. </p> <p>In Holland, babies of 25 or 26 weeks are offered intensive care at doctors' discretion, and those of 23 and 24 weeks are left to die. That rigid system should not be applied in Britain. There is no automatic equation of survival, but nor should doctors ever fail to tell parents desperate for their babies to live how high a price continued existence may exact. Consultants' duty of care extends also to explaining why a peaceful death may be better for the sickest newborn babies than aggressive life-saving. </p> <p>Such critical decisions demand more public debate and a wider dialogue between doctors and parents. While it is not clear exactly why or how communications broke down in the Wyatt case, turning private tragedy into courtroom drama is a mark of someone's failure. Such a landmark case may help define doctors' rights to refuse resuscitation, but clearer edicts also demand greater trust on both sides. </p> <p>In the absence of such understanding, the judge will rule on Thursday whether, if Charlotte could speak or reason, she would deem intolerable an existence in the mechanised limbo where torture and salvation overlap. </p> <p>Everyone says her case is rare, but that is far too consoling. Each day, children on the margins of survival are born into a world where mortality equals failure and where the presumption is for life, however pointlessly imposed and cruelly prolonged. The lesson from Court 47, delivered to a society craving miracles, is that death also constitutes a happy ending. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@observer.co.uk\">mary.riddell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The burly nomad with a henna beard and a fierce scowl grips the pen between his thick fingers. Turgul cannot read the election material around him, but is determined to practise the first vote of his life. <p>The turbaned tribesman drags the pen across a scrap of paper. 'Just like that,' he says uncertainly, holding aloft the squiggle that will mark his choice. </p> <p>Few elections have faced such a dizzy array of challenges as Saturday's presidential poll in Afghanistan. Taliban terrorists are threatening bombings and warlords may try to warp the result. The terrain is forbidding, the logistics maddening and, like Turgul, many voters are illiterate. 'It's been very difficult,' said Amandine Roche, a United Nations civil education officer. 'But Afghans really want this to work.' </p> <p>More than 10 million voters have registered, 40 per cent of them women; there is an ethnically diverse field of 18 candidates; and for the first time ever war-worn Afghans will taste democracy. </p> <p>There is anxiety, however. In the south and south-east, the Taliban have threatened to scuttle the poll through violence and intimidation. Yesterday Afghan and coalition forces arrested 25 Taliban suspects in a dawn raid in Kabul. </p> <p>Away from the capital, the main worry is the warlords who, between them, have 45,000 gunmen in their pay. Flush with soaring drug revenues, many vow to retain influence over their fiefdoms. 'Many rural voters say the militias have told them how to vote, and they're afraid of disobeying,' said Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch. </p> <p>The UN, which is spending \u00a3111 million on the election, must overcome daunting geography: high mountains, deserts, bone-jarring roads. </p> <p>The UN has 115,000 election officials and has hired 5,000 satellite phones, 1,150 jeeps, four helicopters and a cargo jet. But the final vote will not be tallied until the last ballot-box returns from the farthest reaches of the Hindu Kush mountains by donkey, up to two weeks after polling day. </p> <p>Yet Afghans are displaying an infectious enthusiasm. Yesterday Kuchi nomads gathered outside their tents on a dusty hillside near Kabul for a lesson in voting. </p> <p>Shah Faqir, a one-eyed sheep farmer, was unable to read but could point to the photograph of his chosen candidate, Hamid Karzai, the country's interim leader. 'He stopped the fighting and brought stability to this country,' he said. 'The others are bad guys. If they win, the gunmen will return and the country will be destroyed.' </p> <p>The Kuchi women have also registered to vote, but were nowhere to be seen. </p> <p>Karzai is the favourite but may face a second round of voting if his nearest rival, the former Education Minister Yunus Qanooni, polls strongly. Both are flag-bearers for their ethnic communities: Qanooni is a northern Tajik, Karzai a southern Pashtun but with broader appeal. </p> <p>Some say an election now is too dangerous. But 'most Afghans see it as a move away from the rule of the gun, and that is positive,' said Grant Kippen of the US National Democratic Institute, a non-profit organisation that helps to oversee elections..</p>",
  "According to the readers of Yours, a magazine for the over-60s, there are few advantages to modern life, and the contraceptive pill isn't one. There are washing machines, inside lavatories and central heating, but they come as small reward for those lost childhoods of the 1950s, when days dawned without fear, and many innocent hours could be spent alone on bicycles. <p>'The readers are looking at the lives of their grandchildren and comparing them to the childhoods they had, and they are feeling sad that the freedom they had has gone forever,' said Valery McConnell, the magazine's editor. </p> <p>This seems to be a view shared by the Catholic church. While one can only assume that no Yours readers spent any time in the church's more notorious institutions during that decade, you can see the point. Back then, nobody told you anything if you were a child. Now, Cardinal Keith O'Brien is very exercised that we are telling children far too much. </p> <p>When the cardinal was handed an early draft of the Scottish Executive's strategy for 'Enhancing Sexual Well-being in Scotland', he was outraged by what he saw as plans for sex education for three-years-olds, and contraception being handed out to teenagers without their parents' knowledge. 'State-sponsored sexual abuse,' he called it. </p> <p>Equally powerful has been the church's fury at North Lanarkshire Council's plans to combine the campuses of Catholic and nondenominational schools as part of a \u00a3150 million plan to replace its rundown primary schools. Church leaders say they will go to law for separate entrances and staff rooms for Catholics. </p> <p>Jack McConnell has only been partially successful in facing down the church. While he managed to slip away from the furore over the shared campuses by having the Executive say: 'It's up to the [individual] council how to proceed', the charge of sex abuse had the First Minister on his knees faster than a bolt from the blue. There was 'no prospect' of the cardinal's fears being realised, he said. </p> <p>Instead, it has fallen to the Church of Scotland to chastise the cardinal. On Thursday, David Alexander, the convenor of the Kirk's education committee, said that O'Brien had not given enough credit to the professionalism of teachers in doing the right thing. He also questioned the cardinal's presentation of the draft proposals, saying there was no reference to teaching preschool children about sexual acts, but only a plan to discuss relationships. He regretted the argument had been bogged down in such an unnuanced debate. </p> <p>It is good to hear the Kirk getting involved. The discussions over the shared campuses, Section 28, sex education and 'quickie' divorces have been dominated by the willingness of the Catholic church to come forward and offer its moral position. Until now, the Kirk has been less stentorian, projecting a voice that may well be calm, thoughtful and rational, but only because it is so peaceful as to be inaudible. </p> <p>However you feel about the Catholic church's positions, there is no question that it is healthy to hear them. You might see a paradox in its desire to keep its schools separate, while pontificating on sex education in others, but the church argues, quite rightly, that there are many Catholic children who are educated in nondenominational schools. </p> <p>You might think there is a certain hypocrisy, if not spookiness, in the church's willingness to show schoolchildren graphic videos of abortion, while complaining about lessons on biological imperatives, but faith is faith and the church has a pastoral duty to promote its beliefs. </p> <p>You might think that those readers of Yours magazine were the lucky ones, who reached maturity without being abused, made pregnant or emotionally lost, because nobody explained anything to them. You might think the Catholic schools, once necessary to see off Protestant persecution, now succour sectarianism, but still the church's view are legitimate, whether you agree with them or not. The problem is the Catholic church is heard above all others. </p> <p>The Scottish Catholic Media Office, run by Peter Kearney, is a brilliant idea, as is the role of John Deighan, the church's parliamentary officer. We can't help but hear the church's views clearly. The Kirk needs to match it in force, as do others who claim to consider our moral health. This was why it was so refreshing to hear from Alexander on the subject of sex education, because his views were legitimate, level and, to my mind, right. </p> <p>For those who disagree with some of the Catholic church's positions, it is not enough to rely on the First Minister and his cabinet to make the arguments. As his response to the attack from the cardinal shows, McConnell is fearful of the church's power. In these less sectarian days, that power comes from swaying public opinion, so it is infinitely desirable that arguments are heard from all corners, from the established church to the non-established, from the professionals, to the maverick voices.It is an unfortunate truth for the Kirk that the pulpit is no longer the only, or the best, place from which to get its message across. They need to step up. We need loud moral debates.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com\">ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>This time it's serious. This time, after years of threats defused, there's a de facto privacy law coming. This time, neither an outraged press nor complaisant British government can stop the legal world and get off. </p> <p>For 10 years, Princess Caroline of Monaco has been battling against the paparazzi - and watching resentfully as their pictures of her shopping, strolling or picking up kids from school are plastered across German magazines. In France, with a privacy law intact, she could stop them; but just over the border, the market in Caroline snaps boomed. She was a 'public figure par excellence'. She had no recourse. </p> <p>Not any more. Two months ago, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg found that the right to freedom of expression (article 10 of the charter) did not trump article eight (the privacy clause) unless the photographs published made a contribution 'to a debate of general interest'. In short, if they did nothing more than pander to what the Princess's lawyers called 'magazine readers' voyeuristic tendencies', they were totally out of order. </p> <p>Everyone, including celebrities, had a right to retain their 'personal identity, personal appearance and psychological integrity', the court said - not to mention their 'interaction with others, including in a public context'. </p> <p>There couldn't be a bigger philosophical jump. The British situation, enshrined in the Press Complaints Commission code, allows photography in public places and defines those quite closely: a hotel lobby, for instance, but not a hotel bedroom. But the Human Rights judges say privacy is almost a personal cocoon you carry round with you, a cocoon that can be punctured only if you're a public official or figure doing something criminal, dodgy or wrong. </p> <p>Instant uproar. The German press - and then international press campaigners - have besieged Berlin demanding that their government appeal against that judgment and stave off its consequences. But no, there won't be an appeal. Last week the deadline passed and Herr Schr\u00f6der did nothing. The re-balancing of eight and 10 stands, which means that the British courts hearing similar cases will have to rebalance their stance (basically, leave it to the PCC) as well. You can almost see Gwyneth Paltrow smiling as her paparazzi pursuers pack up and depart. </p> <p>Who is going to be sweating hardest over this? Magazines like Heat, full of snatched pictures of celebrity cellulite, may go the way of all flesh. No psychological or personal integrity there. Celeb mags across Europe which fill their pages with beach fondles and airport hugs have a rude awakening coming. Red-top and middle-market papers stalking film stars or paying thousands for an illicit kiss are in the same bind. This, prospectively, is another industry going to the wall. This is another kind of hunting ban. </p> <p>Any joy, of course, should be strictly confined. The UK case that triggers change here hasn't happened yet. The PCC is watching and waiting, redrafting nothing for the moment. The loudest cries of happiness are coming from exactly those specialist legal media firms that currently charge \u00a3800 an hour in no-win-no-fee libel cases and grow fat on gargantuan costs. (Here comes another nice little earner!) Upmarket editors who think they'll be unaffected may have some nasty surprises when these eagles start stretching their wings. </p> <p>Nevertheless, you can see the celebrity future stretching ahead. Money in the bank for toothy grins and beautiful homes, pictures with not a hair out of place, marriages that never grow cold: a world where privacy permission only gets lifted for cash, where all men wear stuffed dummy grins and their wives come from Stepford. </p> <p>Welcome to Hello!ville, the hometown plugs and paid-for publicity and glycerine smiles. It may not be a shining city of journalistic endeavour. Indeed, it may be damnably boring. But it's article eight, with a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down.</p> <p><strong>Indy squares up to Guardian in navel-gazing stakes</strong></p> <p>It is a year since the Times (with all the might of Murdoch behind it) started a Tuesday supplement called 'Public Agenda' designed to cream off some of the public service job ads from Wednesday's 'Society Guardian'. Reality check: this week 'Society Guardian' was 116 pages fat, with 100 pages of ads. The Times 's contender had 11 job pages out of 20. </p> <p>The battle isn't over yet, of course. Wapping hopes may still lie somewhere towards the end of the 'Public Agenda' rainbow. But it's a long, slow, brutally expensive haul. Which brings us to the Independent 's new Monday contender, 'Media Weekly', right, challenging 'Media Guardian' for its crown.</p> <p>I have an interest to declare. I'm a paid-up resident of Navel Nook. I was part of the team, long ago, which invented 'Media Guardian' (and all the other supplements there) and I know how it was done. Slowly, determinedly, working with the grain of readers you already had, engaging them with special coverage of their field and building a wider market.</p> <p>When the Mail or the Telegraph snipe at the Guardian 's public appointments pages, as though they were part of some covert leftie conspiracy, they forget all about building market places. (The Mail still has one, against all odds, in the printing trade; the Telegraph is strong on commercial travellers). Now, can the compact Indy make its mark - with Greg Dyke, Kelvin MacKenzie et al holding up Ray Snoddy's new baby?</p> <p>Maybe. These are very early days. But, on the reality check front, the Indy has two pages of jobs out of 24 and the Guardian 25 out of 40. The Indy 's first week take can't have been much over \u00a315,000, while the Guardian counts its annual media revenue in millions - or even tens of millions. Its specialist website has 150,000 registered users.</p> <p>Others have passed this way before. The London Evening Standard media challenge came and went. The Times had ambitions when it first hired Snoddy. But nobody, so far, has had the patience or resources to persevere. Good luck to anyone who does. But meanwhile raise a slightly quizzical eyebrow as Simon Kelner celebrates the first glowing year of his compact revolution and says 'we needed an extra section to beef up Mondays'.</p> <p>One key to the Indy 's compact success is that the paper is indeed compact, not bulbous. Why go back to waging a war of dead forests on the peaks of pointless pagination?</p> <p><strong>Depravity? Just look in the Mirror</strong></p> <p>Stan Collymore, retired footballer, is an amoral, promiscuous attention-seeker, a 'pervert' descended into 'total depravity'. Who says so? Feisty Sue Carroll of the Daily Mirror. But which paper, day after day last week, cleared its pages to let this 'depraved pervert' tell tales about the models and TV presenters who had briefly attracted his attention? No prizes: Mirror, Mirror off the wall, who's the scummiest (and most hypocritical) of them all? </p> <p>On the first day of the Labour party conference the paper Hugh Cudlipp made great led with 'I had three in a bed sex with X ... and sex with A, B and C,' (My alphabet soup as legal minestrone begins to slop over Stan, right). Politics? 'Only Labour can deliver what our country needs and - especially - what our readers want,' announced an editorial beset by double entendres.</p> <p>Now, what would the European Court of Human Rights make of that? Possibly, though improbably, they would say that the love life of television totties and randy centre forwards can be regarded as having some kind of higher public interest. But the vilest, saddest encounter - duly recounted by the Mirror - involved (almost a decade ago) the 18-year-old daughter of the then Liverpool manager, Roy Evans.</p> <p>On the night that Liverpool lost the cup final, says Stan, he and this 'slim but buxom' lass had 'reasonably loud sex' in the hotel room next to the one where dad was sleeping. Much shushing and tip-toeing. Ho-ho-ho!</p> <p>But what, pray, is the justification for randomly pouring dung over the young daughter of a football manager who made a poor private decision many long years ago? Why does she - her dad retired, her life utterly changed - rate a picture on page 5 and readers' attention?</p> <p>A privacy law, we are repeatedly told, must be there to protect 'ordinary people'.</p> <p>Here's a very ordinary person, a little girl grown up, getting trampled without a second thought in the cause of what Sue Carroll might rightly call total depravity (both Stan's and her own wretched paper's).</p> <p><strong>Everyone's chasing the Fox</strong></p> <p>Some checks, meanwhile, bring news of a reality you would rather not think about. </p> <p>American cable news networks have just issued their independently researched viewing statistics for the third quarter of the year.</p> <p>And the winner is... Fox News, for the first time drawing more than its four competitors - CNN, MSNBC, CNBC and Headline News - put together.</p> <p>It beat not just the cable gang but all the major networks for convention coverage and has nine out of the top 10 news shows.</p> <p>Is it what Mark Thompson's BBC might call 'didactic'? Sure.</p> <p>But Panorama, and its ratings, are one thing, and Rupert's old-time religion rather another.</p>",
  "At the beginning of the 1990s, the Ulster Defence Association in Belfast had a major problem with bullets. The arsenals of the two loyalist terror groups - the UDA and the Ulster Volunteer Force - had been filled with a new range of weaponry at the end of the previous decade, thanks to the Lebanese civil war and South African arms dealers and agents. <p>With the proceeds of a bank robbery in Portadown, Co. Armagh, in 1987, the loyalists had bought a large number of AK-47 rifles, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), explosives and ammunition. </p> <p>The weapons had once belonged to the IRA's old Middle Eastern friends, the Pales tinian Liberation Organisation, but they had been captured by the Israelis and their Lebanese Christian allies after the 1982 invasion of south Lebanon. </p> <p>The loyalists were quick to employ their new firepower against a range of targets. The RPGs from Lebanon were used to blow up Sinn Fein advice centres, while the AK-47s were employed in atrocities ranging from the Ormeau Road betting shop massacre to the Halloween slaughter at Greysteel. Armed with their new weapons, the UDA's murder rate rapidly shot up until the tally of murders by the UDA and UVF exceeded that of the IRA in 1993. </p> <p>It was, however, a death toll that could have been far higher. The arms had arrived in Northern Ireland, hidden in a ship transporting roof tiles from Cyprus. However, unknown to the loyalists, as they took possession of their new arsenal there was a serious problem. Much of the ammunition was of Chinese origin and of poor quality. </p> <p>Over the next seven years, numerous lives were saved as the guns continually jammed due to faulty rounds. </p> <p>As one active loyalist, who was involved in terrorism in the early 1990s, put it: 'There are a lot of people walking the streets of Belfast today who don't know how lucky they are to be alive.' </p> <p>One of those whose life was spared by a jammed weapon was white, South African-born Dr Adrian Guelke, a Queen's University lecturer. The 44-year-old academic was shot once in the back after UDA gunmen burst into his south Belfast home on 4 September, 1991. </p> <p>The shooting took place in Fitzwilliam Street at about 4.30am, while Dr Guelke lay asleep, his assailant's weapon jamming after the first round was fired. </p> <p>The attempted killing of Guelke would reveal much about the murky nature of where security, terrorism and competing international intelligence groups lethally coincided in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>At first, the murder bid bewildered the RUC. For although Guelke had written about Northern Irish affairs, his main interest was in his native South Africa as a critic of the apartheid regime. </p> <p>The reality of the loyalist assassination attempt on Guelke would turn out to be one of the most bizarre episodes of the Troubles. </p> <p>It was a set-up job concocted by the South African Defence Forces' intelligence branch, which had used a doctored RUC intelligence report to convince a loyalist hit squad that Guelke was an IRA asset and link man to the African National Congress. </p> <p>In an affair with twists as complicated as any thriller, South African intelligence had decided that it wanted Guelke dead, and to achieve this end it planned to use an RUC Special Branch file on a second academic [who cannot be named for legal reasons]. </p> <p>The second academic, unlike Guelke, was deeply involved with the IRA. He had worked closely with Eamon Collins at Queen's University in the early 1980s. He was the IRA activist who would later betray his former comrades and be murdered for it. It was he who had helped the IRA obtain an arms cache from the PLO in the Middle East as part of that organisation's own arms procurement effort. It was this man, too, who almost certainly was the real link man with the ANC. </p> <p>So it was little surprise that he should not only have been the target of an RUC Special Branch intelligence operation, nor that the file on him should have been shared with interested foreign agencies, including Mossad. </p> <p>While no one knows how the file on the academic came to be with the South Africans, one thing is now certain: someone saw it as an opportunity to set Guelke up. That person was Leon Flores, a South African agent who worked out of the embassy in London and was eventually deported from the UK in April 1992. Taking the original document, Flores replaced the name and details of the IRA-linked academic with Guelke's. </p> <p>With the doctored RUC document, Flores flew to Belfast via London in the autumn of 1991 and contacted the UDA, providing the South Belfast Brigade with the revised intelligence report. To make sure that they had got the point, he even brought a UDA unit to Guelke's home in Fitzwilliam Street in the University area just days before the shooting. </p> <p>The plot was all the more ironic because, far from being a supporter of IRA violence, Guelke was also an opponent of republican violence in Northern Ireland and had established a working rapport in his academic pursuits with the old UDA leadership of the late John McMichael and the organisation's ousted chairman, Andy Tyrie. </p> <p>'I used to go to dinner with Tyrie and spoke to McMichael regularly. I got on extremely well with both UDA leaders. Obviously the UDA men sent to kill me never knew this,' Guelke reflected 12 years later. </p> <p>Flores continued to dabble in the murky world of loyalist terrorism even after Adrian Guelke was shot. In London, he linked up with a UDA unit in the UK capital urging them to kill a South African dissident in exchange for more South African weapons. </p> <p>'If we had got our hands on the original RUC file and found out who the real IRA link was [the other lecturer] we would have used that and put him down a hole instead,' one UDA commander reflected more than 10 years after the Guelke debacle. </p> <p>What the Flores connec tion demonstrates about the UDA was its willingness to seek help from any quarter, regardless of the hidden agenda of those allegedly aiding the loyalist cause. </p> <p>The same UDA commander, who has since come to regret the organisation's role as patsy for the South Africans, also admits that the UDA had a tendency back then to take information and source material from anyone willing to provide it. 'Very few times did we ask ourselves if we were being set up or used. We just took the stuff and did the business.' </p> <p>Fortunately for Guelke, the incompetence of his would-be assassins, and the faulty nature of the ammunition in 1991, prevented the 'business' from being carried out. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> UDA - Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror is published by Penguin, price \u00a312.99</p>",
  "Somewhere in the bleary early hours of last Friday morning, a bunch of jubilant strangers gatecrashed the victory party of Labour's newest MP. <p>The activists from the anti-European UK Independence Party (Ukip) might ordinarily have expected to be barred from the Hartlepool HQ of Ian Wright. But not, it seems, on a by-election night in which they forced the Conservatives into a humiliating fourth place. 'As we'd beaten the Tories, we were welcome,' recalls Clive Page, their Hartlepool spokesman. </p> <p>This weekend, as he prepares for his first party conference as Conservative leader, Michael Howard faces a peculiarly unholy alliance against him. </p> <p>From the right, Ukip is marching on Tory heartlands with its promises of withdrawal from the EU; to the left, the Lib Dems are scooping up the disaffected Labour protest votes that Howard needs. Squeezed in the middle are the Tories, trying to decide where to open fire first. </p> <p><b>The plan for power</b><br> </p> <p>This week, Howard's team will unveil plans for their first day, first week and first month in government, a bold move to make them look poised triumphantly on the brink of power. Just days after what shadow defence secretary Nicholas Soames succinctly described as a 'fucking awful' result in Hartlepool, they might struggle to look convincing. </p> <p>Yet the irony is that Howard, who was elected unopposed as a unity candidate more than 11 months ago, following the vicious disposal of Iain Duncan Smith, has done most of what his party asked. He has restored the Tories' credibility at Westminster, boosted dwindling membership, opened party donors' chequebooks and quelled the eternal plotting that destroyed his predecessors. </p> <p>The only thing he has not done is actually win over voters. Trust in Tony Blair has collapsed, but that is prompting a backlash against all mainstream politicians, not enthusiasm for Howard. One year later, recent polls reveal that nearly one Tory in five would rather see Blair in Downing Street than his own party: Blair scores higher than Howard on both competence and being 'in touch' - and highest of all among potential Tory swing voters. </p> <p>Stephan Shakespeare of YouGov, the party's former pollsters, says they are no longer flatlining in the polls: it's worse than that. 'You would normally be expecting a rising curve going into the next election to get in reach of the target,' he says. 'The fact it has stayed where it is means they are, in reality, going backwards.' </p> <p><b>Party troubles</b><br> </p> <p>No wonder the mood, as the party faithful gather in Bournemouth, is queasy, not least among Tory MPs with knife-edge majorities. 'There will be fluttering in the dovecotes over this,' says one veteran frontbencher, ominously. 'Conference is going to be difficult.' </p> <p>Howard will try to calm his restive party - as Blair did his last week - by lowering the temperature. He will not, frontbenchers insist, be panicked into offering specific tax cuts, although Oliver Letwin, the shadow Chancellor, will send broad signals. </p> <p>And there will be no overblown rhetoric, no 'big ideas': just small, practical policies, with a promise that ministers who fail to deliver them will be fired. The Tories hope this will reassure a new breed of floating voter, convinced grandiose political promises cannot be trusted. </p> <p>'How many big ideas have we had from Blair? \"A thousand days for a thousand years\"; \"the young country\"; \"the giving age\"; \"healing the scars of Africa\",' says David Cameron, formerly Howard's special adviser and now his shadow cabinet policy co-ordinator. 'People are fed up with politicians grandstanding.' </p> <p>The task instead, as chairman Liam Fox will tell the conference tomorrow, is for the Tories to prove that 'political parties are not all the same'. </p> <p>The risk, however, is that such low-key language will be drowned out in a cacophony of conflicting advice from the sidelines, with right-wingers demanding more Euro-scepticism to prevent Ukip defectors. Can Howard stick to his course? </p> <p><b>Whiff of panic</b><br> </p> <p>The word that Howard's political admirers use most often of him is 'decisive'. 'He is very focused on what he wants to achieve; he doesn't brook diversions,' says Andrew Lansley, his shadow health secretary. Cameron argues Howard is more sure of himself now than he ever was as Home Secretary: 'He seems more calm, more measured.' </p> <p>In Central Office, however, there is a whiff of panic. The first sign came with an interview published in the anti-war New Statesman last Thursday - the day Hartlepool went to the polls - in which Howard directly accused Blair of lying over Iraq, a charge even Charles Kennedy has avoided. </p> <p>Howard voted for the war, and still supports it: like John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate whose 'flip flopping' on Iraq has damaged him, was he now jumping belatedly on the anti-war bandwagon? Opponents scented blood. </p> <p>'It's a desperate attempt to seize ground that we're occupying,' says an indignant Tim Razzall, the Lib Dem campaign manager. Downing Street, too, is preparing to exploit Howard's inconsistencies on Iraq, believing the public will resent any breaking of ranks when British troops are still under fire. </p> <p>There may trouble, too, on his own side. Duncan Smith - who received intelligence briefings in the run-up to the invasion and believes Blair acted correctly - is understood to be seeking pledges in Howard's speech this week that the Tories will not dilute support for the war. </p> <p><b>The Ukip threat</b><br> </p> <p>The second warning sign came on the eve of polling, when the party took out a full-page advert in Hartlepool's evening paper declaring its opposition to the euro, the European Constitution and a federal superstate - all of which was calculated to appeal to Ukip defectors. </p> <p>'I thought that was desperate,' says Page, who says this was the point at which he realised his party could beat the Tories. Ukip rubbed salt in the wounds at its own annual conference in Bristol, with a 'victory' dinner for 200 of the faithful last night. </p> <p>However Howard's aides insist there will be no lurch to the right on Europe this week and that there is no evidence such a move would attract the floating vote Howard needs - and Kennedy is already getting. A poll for last week's Economist found that, while 25 per cent of voters would be more likely to vote Tory if Howard pledged to pull out of Europe, a third said it would make no difference as they 'would not vote Tory anyway'. </p> <p><b>Keep buggering on</b><br> </p> <p>Andrew Mackay knows a bit about Ukip supporters: the deputy party chairman's own son, Hamish, voted for them in the European elections, 'because he wanted to give us a bloody nose'. Hamish will be voting for his father at the next general election, and Mackay - who is in charge of target seats - believes most of those 'protest-voting' Ukip will follow: 'I think Ukip's bubble will burst.' </p> <p>His optimism is backed by polling carried out in 130 of the Labour-held seats he oversees. It found the Tories have reversed Labour's lead in the battleground for the next election. </p> <p>'They're full of traditional Tory voters who were rather taken with Blair and voted for him in 1997, and now they feel let down,' he said. Crucially, Labour won many of these seats thanks only to tactical voting by Lib Dem voters, who may not help out again. For months, Mackay has been pushing Howard's claim that Blair lied over Iraq. </p> <p>Could these tentative green shoots of Tory revival be real? Even if not, there is no appetite among demoralised MPs for another leadership coup with a general election so close: they accept not much can be done beyond - as Soames himself put it - 'KBO' [Keep Buggering On]. </p> <p>Even the voters seem confused about what they would prefer: the top choice in the Economist's poll of potential leaders was not any of five senior Tories, but 'someone younger' - a sign that they believe the Tories' Blair, someone who can rescue the party, has not yet emerged. </p> <p>However, a bad result could prompt a leadership contest, probably between David Davis and Liam Fox on the right and Letwin, Lansley or Damian Green, the recently deposed shadow education secretary, on the moderate wing. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, due to return to Parliament at the next election, is also a contender. Gentle manoeuvring may begin this week. </p> <p><b>It's the voters, stupid</b><br> </p> <p>Shakespeare has a warning for the Conservatives - the experience of three leaders in as many years should teach them that its problem is policies, not people: 'Leaders have far less of an effect than we normally give credit for.' </p> <p>Dominic Cummings, former head of strategy at Central Office, agrees there is 'no magic bullet', beyond a radical intellectual refreshment of the party. Lack of trust in Blair, he argues, is not enough to guarantee victory: 'Trust in Clinton plummeted after the Lewinsky scandal but his job approval ratings did not.' </p> <p>Lansley accepts that the Tories' first task is getting voters to trust politicians again, but argues a centralising platform of free-market economics, social tolerance and a gentle scepticism about the EU could prove a vote-winner: </p> <p>'The 20, 30, 40-somethings who are at the heart of those the Conservative Party has to win over - that's the way they approach life now.' </p> <p>What they are not doing, yet, is approaching the Conservative Party. </p> <p><b>Two sides of Michael Howard:</b></p> <p><b>Soft cop:</b> </p> <p>'We are all crew on what at its best is the most superb campaigning vessel politics has ever known.' <b>Howard on being made leader of the Conservative Party, November 2003 </b> </p> <p>'It was a bold and brave experiment but it didn't work, it was a mistake, I've apologised for it before and I'm happy to do so again.' <b>On the poll tax, December 2003</b> </p> <p>'One of the worst ways in which people are denied control over their own lives.

  "When Melvyn Bragg blurted out that Tony Blair 'nearly did go and call it a day' in the spring because of 'personal and family' pressures, he may have been betraying a confidence or speaking off the top of his head, but he was revealing no more than an indisputable truth that everything in British politics still centres on the Prime Minister. <p>He may be battered. He may be routinely accused of lying - as if he knew Saddam Hussein had no weapons and decided he could get away with covering up because, hell, no one would notice once the war was over. But we're still a monarchical country, and all that those who matter in political London can think about is the monarch, his family, his health and his whims. </p> <p>The King's heart flutters and the palace trembles. Courtiers huddle in corners, their eyes flicking over each others' shoulders to check for traitors. When they're sure they're safe, they mutter that the King's health is weak and the people who once adored him are crying that his mind is weaker still. Can he carry on? Can he win again? </p> <p>The New Labour dynasty has many aims but one purpose: to hold on to power at any price. The country has a Chancellor who is almost as powerful as the King. Could he replace him? Legions of difficulties assail the courtiers as soon as the seditious thought is whispered. The peasants of southern England are a fickle and greedy rabble. They may say they trust the Chancellor now, but he is a foreigner, and his strange morality is alien to them. The courtiers can't help but worry about their own places at court, for the Chancellor has courtiers of his own. Other barons want the throne, they reflect. Can the Chancellor take it without factionalism, chaos, civil war? But if he is denied the throne, will he rebel and ferment a civil war of his own? </p> <p>What to do? The King says there is nothing to do because he will stay on the throne for another five years. Why, then, has he bought a great house in a garden square? Does he mean what he says? Or does he plan to retire to his estate? </p> <p>And what of the Queen? Bragg was right on one point: the opinion of the royal family matters. If she wants her husband to stay, he will. If she says go, he will listen. Does she think her husband's policies make the stress and the insults worth bearing? Or, to put the question bluntly: if she wasn't married to the leader of the Labour Party would she vote Lib Dem at the next election? </p> <p>As befits a monarchical country, the political books publishers like best are personal accounts of the machinations at the top. Robin Cook, John Prescott, Alastair Campbell and Cherie Blair have one biography each. Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson have two. Tony Blair has five. The last two have just been released and couldn't be more different. </p> <p>Anthony Seldon's is a huge piece of work. He's careful before he criticises the Prime Minister, but his sources are very hard on Cherie Blair. The adoption of her husband's name is the giveaway, they say. She has gone from being Cherie Booth, the brilliant lawyer and radical barrister, to Cherie Blair, the Prime Ministerial consort obsessed with celebrities, fashion and New Age quackery. Francis Beckett's and David Hencke's biography is shorter and tougher and reaches the opposite conclusion. It's hard on the Prime Minister but goes easy on his wife. There has been no Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation from Ms Booth into Mrs Blair. She remains what she always was: Cherie Booth, a passionate defender of human rights. </p> <p>Beckett and Henke assert that she privately opposed the Iraq war. It seems a reasonable inference. Her law firm Matrix Chambers produced an opinion which claimed the war was illegal and is now supporting the constitutionally illiterate campaign to impeach Blair - a stance which must make potential clients wonder about paying through the nose for its services. But after the Beckett and Henke biography book went to press, its subject told the Telegraph that her husband's Iraq policy had her unequivocal support. When I checked with one of their sources, he said that his best guess was that she was torn: should she support American adventurism, or should she recommend leaving one of the worst tyrants on earth in power? </p> <p>It's impossible to know who is telling the truth. But if you put her views in March last year to one side, it's clear that she must abhor the war on terror. You don't have to decide whether you can trust the anonymous sources before reaching this conclusion. You just have to read what she says. </p> <p>Her best legal work has been as a supporter of the movement to limit national sovereignty which swept the world after the collapse of communism. The nation state must no longer be allowed to abuse human rights with impunity. UN courts and European Conventions of Human Rights must limit its power to do as it wishes. If General Pinochet was caught wondering through London's grander stores, he should be arrested and made to account for his many crimes. The British state could no longer get away with using 'national security' as a catch-all justification for the denial of liberty. </p> <p>If she wasn't married to the Prime Minister, it's easy to imagine her standing up before the Law Lords to denounce his government's determination to intern Arab terrorist suspects without charge or trial on secret evidence which may have been obtained by torturers. </p> <p>Last year she went public to question George W Bush's refusal to allow Ameri can's to face charges of committing crimes against humanity before the International Criminal Court. The court was a 'shining example', she said, which made the best human rights aspirations of the post-war world come true. In his debate with John Kerry last week, George W Bush dismissed the court as 'a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors could pull our troops, our diplomats up for trial'. </p> <p>Precious little common ground there. </p> <p>Tony Blair is no respecter of the Treaty of Westphalia and the sovereign immunity of nation states it confers, as his willingness to take on the organisers of mass slaughters from Belgrade to Baghdad shows. But Britain has been no more willing to put pressure on the US to sign-up to the International Criminal Court than it has been ready to demand that Guantanamo Bay be brought under the rule of law. I don't think it's hyperbolic to guess that Ms Booth must shudder whenever she hears a report from Guantanamo. If she doesn't, she is making a nonsense of her life. </p> <p>There are aspects of Tony Blair's domestic policy that must also make her cringe. Not all of it, by any means. One of the paradoxes of the times is that at the very moment when the liberal-left intelligentsia has decided that Blair is a mendacious sell-out, he has come up with a passably radical programme for his third term. You can easily imagine his promise at last week's conference to help mothers and children delighting his wife. </p> <p>Yet the better side of the government's programme is obscured by its desperate attempt to hang on to working-class voters by running on a law-and-order ticket. In the Birmingham, Coventry and Hartlepool by-elections, Labour could think of nothing else to talk about. In Hartlepool the Liberal Democrat candidate, a decent lawyer, rather like Cherie Booth, had the most ridiculous accusations thrown at her: that she was a friend of junkies; that she wanted to 'let child killers out of jail'; that she would 'give teen criminals social workers not court cases.' </p> <p>Such rhetoric has led to a near-doubling of the prison population since Cherie's husband became Labour's home affairs spokesman in the early 1990s. Earlier this year in The Observer she denounced the system he presided over for trapping women prisoners in a 'cycle of poverty and crime'. Once again, the common ground is hard to find. </p> <p>Obviously one can make too much of this, and I probably have. I'm sure Cherie Booth is determined that her husband's Prime Ministerial career won't end in a humiliating resignation, and every Westminster correspondent says that she has urged him to resist Gordon Brown's attempts to force him out of 10 Downing Street. </p> <p>For all that, her husband's foreign policy is tied to defending the abuses of American power while his domestic policy panders to the worst instincts of wavering voters. Does she ever wonder if the New Labour game is worth the candle? There are a lot of women like her who have decided that it isn't.</p>",
  "<p>Dundee made a fine start with a goal in the first minute but had to be content with a draw after Markus Heikkinen replied for the home team shortly before the interval. Both sides put their all into the game, but Dundee midfielder Mark Fotheringham was guilty of taking the fighting spirit too far when he appeared to stamp on the Aberdeen goalscorer in the second half and was sent off. </p> <p>Dundee made their dream start when Fotheringham played a free-kick into the area for Iain Anderson, who hit a shot on target from 12 yards. Aberdeen goalkeeper David Preece fumbled the ball into the path of Sutton, who burst through a ruck of players before poking the ball home. Sutton had a chance to double his tally a minute later but shot at the goalkeeper from 12 yards. </p> <p>The home team were struggling to cope with the threat of the Dundee striker and were lucky to escape again when he found space in the penalty area, but Sutton hesitated and was tackled by Anderson as he prepared to shoot. </p> <p>Aberdeen hit the woodwork in the 33rd minute and once again Anderson was in the thick of the action. He nodded a cushioned header into the path of Steven Craig, whose header floated over goalkeeper Derek Soutar's head but bounced off the bar. </p> <p>The captain's persistence in attack finally paid off as he dragged his team back into the match with a fine set-up for Heikkinen. The Finn appeared to handle as he controlled Anderson's knockdown but turned and roll the ball in. </p> <p>Aberdeen started the second half more urgently than the first and Scott Severin demonstrated their intent to go forward early on after turning on the edge of the area and shooting just inches wide of Soutar's goal. Aberdeen had a penalty claim denied in the 53rd minute when Severin's shot appeared to hit Brent Sancho's hand as he slid in to clear. </p> <p>Dundee made their first change seconds later, with Hernandez coming on in place of Anderson. They were without Bobby Mann for several minutes as he had a cut to his head patched up, but the defender was able to continue after treatment. </p> <p>Heikkinen came close to scoring his second on the hour, but his angled drive flew wide of Soutar's post. Then, in the 71st minute, Dundee were reduced to 10 men after a moment of madness by Fotheringham, who seemed to stamp on Heikkinen as they contested a 50-50 ball. Having been booked for a foul on Richard Foster in the first half, he was show the yellow card again and then sent off. </p> <p>Aberdeen had a few late chances to score, but Dundee's centre-half partnership of Mann and Sancho held firm to earn their team a point.</p>",
  "<p>At 44, after 16 years of being a self-employed GP principal, Angela has left her partnership and taken a salaried GP post instead. She writes:</p> <p>'The work-life balance was out of control and at last I've been able to work part-time. The main part of my income is now on PAYE but I still have other roles as a doctor where I am considered self-employed, so my income can fluctuate by a few hundred pounds a month. </p> <p>I am divorced and have a 15-year-old daughter at a fee-paying school.The fees are my biggest outgoing each month and are money that could otherwise have become a tidy investment. Ho hum. We hope she will go to university in 2008. </p> <p>She splits her week between me and her father, who is also self-employed and earns less than I do. Neither of us pays any maintenance to the other, nor is likely to start. </p> <p>I have been in the NHS pension scheme since 1984 but also have two private pensions plans which I suspect were mis-sold and one of which I've lost. </p> <p>I own my house with a small repayment mortgage and part-own the surgery.

The negative equity is just over \u00a313,000 so the best I can hope for is that this will be cancelled out by my share of profits and I will in effect leave empty-handed. </p> <p>This surgery loan was tied to an endowment which I plan to cash in when it matures later this year and it should just about pay off the tax bill on last year's self-employed earnings. My share of the surgery was part of my pension planning and that, of course, has gone down the Swanee now. </p> <p>Until last year, I thought of myself as well-off, with cash Isas, Peps, investment plans and endowments but, although I have a good income and respectable savings, I suspect I could organise it better. </p> <p>I am wary of risk when applied to my income yet take a fatalist long-term view - I don't want to put money aside for a future that I may never see. Having said that, I seem to be paying out a small fortune in various insurances. </p> <p>I have term assurance of \u00a3200,000 until 2020, written in trust, and pay \u00a380 a month for long-term sickness insurance and am in the process of buying critical illness insurance for \u00a3100,000 with Medical Sickness Society.</p> <p><strong>Financial surgery needs a holistic view</strong></p> <p>You can rationalise your various cash Isas by amalgamating them into one account.

It will be less confusing then to open one new savings account for tax bills. </p> <p>Tim Norkett, head of private clients at accountant Horwath Clark Whitehill, suggests putting aside 25 per cent of gross freelance earnings: 'This will be sufficient to cover a substantial portion of her tax liability.'</p> <p>But he warns: 'The Inland Revenue will request payments on account for the 2004/5 tax year based on her previous tax liability. If, when the actual liability for the year is calculated, the payments on account were insufficient, the Inland Revenue can charge interest on the shortfall.'</p> <p>He also urges you to claim expenses against your freelance income: 'Previously Angela will not have needed to consider what is euphemistically termed \"use of home as office\". If she does administration work from home, she can claim a proportion of household running costs, stationery and postage, together with depreciation on computer and office equipment.'</p> <p>If you believe university expenses will cost no more than the school fees, and you want to save your spare money for the longer-term, invest in stock market-related investments.

  "<p><strong>New pension row looms</strong></p> <p>Millions of people could find they have a claim for compensation in what could turn out to be the next major mis-selling scandal. </p> <p>Up to 15 million people have contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps) when they would have done far better to stay in this government pension top-up scheme. 'Each claim will turn on its own facts and will depend on key issues such as the individual's age, earnings and attitude to risk,' says Beachcroft Wansbroughs Consulting. 'However, the adviser will need to show not only that they explained the potential benefits of contracting out but also, importantly, the risk that, if pension fund returns and annuity rates do not come up to expectations, the individual would be worse off than if they had stayed contracted into Serps.' </p> <p>Many people were advised to contract out in the late Eighties and early Nineties. Since then, projections have turned out to be vastly over-optimistic.</p> <p><strong>Accidental tourists take note</strong></p> <p>The growing number of holidaymakers who engage in more adventurous sporting and leisure activities on holiday could find they are not covered by their travel insurance policies, according to the Post Office, which is marketing its own top-up scheme.

Companies paying low to average wages are seen as 'no-go zones' by financial advisers and pension scheme providers 'as they are afraid they may be accused of mis-selling to employees who would be better off boosting their state pensions by claiming the pension credit through the government's complex means-testing system'. </p> <p>Providers often increase their standard charges to small employers.

  "<p><strong>The In-Between World of Vikram Lall</strong><br>by MG Vasanji<br>Canongate \u00a314.99, pp439</p> <p>In the author's note that follows the hallucinatory denouement of this ambitious novel, MG Vassanji cites his 'extra debt of gratitude' to the recently opened Asian heritage exhibition in Nairobi. 'It was a long time coming,' he writes, 'this acknowledgment of identity, history and heritage, and I hope it prevails.'</p> <p>He could be speaking of his multilayered, sweeping narrative which maps out the turbulent coming of age of an Indian boy during Kenya's bloody struggle for independence in the 1950s. As its title suggests, 'the in-between world of Vikram Lall' is also an 'acknowledgment of identity, history and heritage', a complex story told by an outsider who finds himself caught up in the upheaval that attends Kenya's terrorist war of independence.</p> <p>The eponymous narrator is an old man in exile, broken by history and compromised by his corruption, reflecting on his life. The story he tells mainly concerns his younger self and his struggle to stay loyal to the friendships he has forged in childhood, not just with the children of the British colonisers, but those of the Mau Mau loyal to Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's self-styled Moses.</p> <p>His 'in-between world' is a microcosm of the bigger picture, the shifting allegiances that attend a country's emergence from empire, the problems of belonging that attend national self-determination.</p> <p>'We have been Africans for three generations,' says Lall early on. 'Family legend has it that one of the rails on the railway line just outside Nakura station has engraved upon it my paternal grandfather's name... the railway running from Mombasa to Kampala, proud \"Permanent Way\" of the British, and \"gateway to the African Jewel\", was our claim to the land.'</p> <p>This is as much a story about not belonging, about adapting to survive, and the cost one pays for that curious half-life, neither wholly Indian, nor truly African. It is also a thwarted love story set in a time when history was moving with tidal momentum but the traditional ways of tribe and religion remained steady and, for Vikram Lall's feisty sister, Deepa, suffocating. She is the story's mischievous centre, and its conscience, though, like her brother, she is eventually broken by the twin forces of family duty and political expediency. At least she puts up a fight.</p> <p>Vikram Lall simply goes with the flow both in his love life and his career, neither objecting to nor rebelling against those who constantly call on his loyalty while compromising the same. While Deepa puts her faith in the purity of love, and endures a breakdown following the end of her forbidden relationship with her childhood sweetheart, her brother's detachment is his ultimate undoing. It becomes a way to survive, then thrive, amid the corruption and chaos of post-colonial Kenya, but it erodes his conscience, eats away at his soul.</p> <p>It seems, in places, that Vassanji is identifying a certain kind of post-colonial pathology, an inability to take control of one's own destiny, a tendency to ebb and flow with the changing tide of history, that will be familiar to readers of VS Naipaul, but which is elaborated here with a great deal more compassion.</p> <p>Though a relatively minor player in Kenya's immediate post-colonial era, Vikram floats to the top through shady connections, the go-between in deals that involve bribery, money laundering, the constants of corrupt government.</p> <p>This is a complex tale, with little attempt by Vassanji to apportion blame to the characters he has lovingly crafted, however misguided or reckless their actions. It is a story, though, clouded by guilt and regret, by thwarted ideals, broken dreams.</p> <p>Vassanji employs an elegantly understated style to describe even the most horrific incidents, thus making them all the more chilling and grotesque. In a story haunted by the Mau Mau, and their often intricately ritualised killings, the oddly old-fashioned, almost paternalistic, narrative tone never wavers. It is almost as if Vikram Lall is recounting a tale in which he was no more than a bystander. That tale is the story of his life and, through it, the painful coming to life of Kenyatta's independent Kenya. It is utterly compelling, and shot though with the intensity of lived experience.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Fascination</strong><br>by William Boyd<br>Hamish Hamilton \u00a316.99, pp209</p> <p>William Boyd seems at pains in this collection to do anything but write beginning-middle-and-end short stories. His formal experiments kick off with a tale written as if it were a video, with fast forwards, rewinds, pauses and slow motions, each with its little universal symbol to tell you which way the narrative is heading. Following on from this remote-controlled opening, he goes on to explore many other rhetorics for channel-hopping experience.</p> <p>There is a story written as an A to Z: 'Xanadu is the name of the bar I work in three nights a week'; 'Zoos consoled me after my father died...' and so on. There are a couple of stories that appear to be culled directly from fragmentary notebooks taken into bars as a writer's disguise for solitariness.</p> <p>There are stories that could be diaries. There is a story written as if it were a play, with chunks of speech apportioned to the likes of 'Lady Marchmont' and 'Lucy de Vries' and 'Alexander Tobias'. There is a story that wants to be a shooting script ('Interior Car. Day') and a story that consists of a succession of bullet-pointed descriptions of lunches ('Date: Monday. Meal: Tabouleh chinois, roulade de foie de veau farcie, millefeuille de fruits d'hiver. Bill: \u00a3878, service not included...').</p> <p>Some of this formal apparatus is tiresome and gets in the way of Boyd's familiar skill with dialogue and detail, his control of comedy. (By Wednesday of the food diary you are gagging for something you can get your teeth into, something less smugly nouvelle). Occasionally, the structural playfulness is surprising and leads to unlikely places. (In 'The Mind/Body Problem', a philosophy student's thoughts on consciousness are chopped into his sideline of flogging steroid substitutes to muscular women at his parents' gym). Often, the tricks look like an effort to galvanise relatively uncoordinated slices of memoir and observation, and to have cleverness stand in place of engagement.</p> <p>Beneath the gimmickry, the stories tend to turn on the quickening of desire and its complicated frustration. Boyd's prose moves like a voyeur's gaze in a crowd. It lights quickly on a face or a gesture, conjures a possible scene, and goes on to the next without ever quite settling.</p> <p>The discursiveness of some of the notebook-style tales exaggerates this sense of attention-deficit. In 'A Haunting', no sooner has his narrative voice encountered a waitress called Leandra 'with a hardpinched face with soft uneven teeth and a pointed stud set in her bottom lip' - and confessed: 'I was drunk but I wanted her, wanted to feel that lip stud graze my body' - than it has chanced upon an optician called Megan, 'a sly looking dark girl with a love bite on her neck'. And so on.</p> <p>Boyd's point in this story is to chart the midlife breakdown of his typically self-obsessed narrator, but the sense of restlessness extends beyond such characterisations to look something like a method or a statement of intent. There is in this respect a feeling of anticlimax about much of the book; the stories often swell with some urgent purpose but rarely deliver on their expectations before moving on.</p> <p>In the best of them, 'Varengeville', say, or 'Fascination', this absence of satisfaction becomes the story itself. In the former, 11-year-old Oliver, staying with his actress mother in France while his father directs a film in England, is banished each afternoon on his bicycle while Maman conducts an affair with an implausible French crooner.</p> <p>Oliver meets an elderly painter who stares for hours at completed seascapes in front of the real thing and wonders what is missing. Over the course of a couple of afternoons, Oliver pursues the painter for answers to his anxieties: 'Do you think that if you are married, you should have a love affair with someone else?' Just as the painter seems as if he might provide the solution to some of these problems, he disappears to Paris, leaving Oliver only one of his canvases to stare at.</p> <p>As he sits near the seashore and looks beyond the frame of the painting, Oliver's eye is caught by a girl in a yellow bikini on the beach. He wonders if he should paint over the artist's efforts, add in the girl: 'Then the painting would at least be finished - at least it would be about something.'</p> <p>Before he begins this, however, Oliver realises something that the artist - and the author of this collection - has been trying to suggest all along - that experience does not come packaged in neat chunks, and that closure is never quite what it seems. You may think you have got one ending in these stories, but no doubt another will be along any minute.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Seventy Two Virgins</strong><br>by Boris Johnson<br>HarperCollins \u00a317.99, pp336</p> <p>A gang of comedy terrorists penetrates the heart of Parliament. A Tory MP's researcher is to blame for the worst security breach in centuries. Ministers look on aghast as Westminster is defended by grand old men in silk stockings, breeches and ceremonial swords.</p> <p>The determination of our times to trump the best fiction can conjure was illustrated again last month when protesters burst into the House of Commons, comprehensively scooping the plot of Boris Johnson's novel, Seventy Two Virgins, for sheer effrontery and farce.</p> <p>The author imagines a group of Islamic militants pulling off an equivalent coup de theatre in the adjacent Westminster Hall, just as the US President is delivering a tiresome speech. A bicycling Tory MP whose buffoonery masks acute intelligence and a classical education - he might sound familiar to some readers - is the last, unlikely hope of the free world. One should not spoil the ending but you might just be able to guess.</p> <p>The action is compressed into four hours, interrupted by occasional digressions to Afghanistan or Henry VIII. But, despite the pacy narration, there is a sense of going nowhere fast, as if the bike-hugging author is peddling furiously but doesn't realise the wheels have come off.</p> <p>The MP-journalist's range is nothing if not topical, slipping in flavour-of-the-month phrases such as 'alpha male', showing he's heard of Pop Idol, turning prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib into a character motive and helpfully explaining that a 'suicide bomber's head would fly off as though drop-kicked by Jonny Wilkinson'. His work is as fresh as a morning newspaper, but nothing dates as quickly as yesterday's news.</p> <p>Yet while Johnson is a heroic failure as a novelist, he scores in his comic handling of those most sensitive issues: the ideological motives of Muslim suicide bombers (whence the title) and the mixed blessings of the American empire. The playing of these as pantomime risks causing offence, but, as in person, Johnson succeeds in being charming and sincere.</p> <p>He grapples with the question of why a young boy from Wolverhampton might grow into an Islamic terrorist; investigates the blown mind of an American sniper who has innocent Iraqi blood on his hands; and dares to speculate that sex or, at least, self-esteem, explains the behaviour of young, male suicide bombers: 'Somewhere in the background of their general screwed-upness was the cultural tectonic grinding between East and West, and the shaming, daring, tempting challenge presented to the Muslim man by the emancipated Western female.'</p> <p>Boris Johnson has written a witty page-turner, but not quite a novel. Digesting this book is like listening to a seasoned raconteur holding court rather than reading a work of literature. It is a flight of fantasy that might have begun as a column in the Spectator or Daily Telegraph, populated by cartoon characters and lubricated by chatty bathos.</p>",
  "<p>Typical of the sport itself, motorcycle racing in this country has a simple and effective system for discovering and nurturing future British world champions. The Yamaha R6 Cup reached the conclusion of its second season recently by crowning Richard Wren as the latest prospect to follow in the footsteps of last year's winner, Tommy Hill. </p> <p>Wren, 22, and Hill, 19, won their respective championships and the guarded respect of the bike world by beating opposition on a playing field so level that talent had to be the only arbiter. The R6 Cup is for riders aged between 16 and 22 with no more than three years' national racing experience. The clever part is that the 600cc Yamaha R6 bikes are identically prepared by a company run by Rob McElnea, a former motorbike champion who also heads the Virgin Mobile Yamaha British Superbike team. The reward for the winner is a leap from virtual obscurity to being a member of McElnea's coveted squad. </p> <p>This time last year, Hill could barely believe his luck. But sceptics doubted whether a novice could safely make the transition without being a menace to himself and, more importantly, the seasoned veterans taking part in the British Superbike Championship, second only to the MotoGP world series in terms of sheer competitiveness and ferocious racing. </p> <p>It is one thing to race a standard bike on road tyres; quite another to get astride a pure racing machine that would need little excuse to test the quality of the slightly built rider's leathers by pitching him on to his bony backside. Hill not only proved the doubters wrong, but he also became one of the stars of the season, working his way up the grid to qualify on the front row at Mallory Park and then at Castle Combe, where he reached the podium with third place in the season-ending race. </p> <p>'First time I rode the bike, it felt real, real stiff; very hard to ride,' says Hill. 'I just couldn't get on with it. I couldn't turn it, couldn't change gear properly, couldn't do anything. So I started getting a bit cocky with the bike, making sure I was in control rather than the bike being in control of me. Then, suddenly, during a pre-season test, everything clicked. Instead of really struggling, I was right on the pace. I was having more fun, letting the bike wiggle into corners, move about more. The Yamaha R1 is basically a forgiving bike. Or it is until you get high-sided and it throws you 15 to 20 feet into the air. That's when you either end up with broken bones or being seriously wounded. You learn that lesson very quickly.' </p> <p>Hill may have been a boy among the bruisers at the start of the season, but his mental approach was that of a mature adult - much to McElnea's surprise. </p> <p>'To be honest,' says McElnea, 'Tommy wasn't my ideal type of guy to work with last year. He had a different head on. He had a completely different make-up and it was one he had to have to win the championship. He didn't mix a lot, didn't do a lot with me, he just had that total goal. </p> <p>'Since winning the R6 Cup, he has come to the party with the mentality of a first-year apprentice. He's been unbelievable in the way he's wanted to learn everything. He's been getting closer to the front end of things while earning attention and respect. Considering his age and experience, he's handled it brilliantly. </p> <p>'I've seen guys who get that far and that's good enough. Doing a few quick laps in practice and being patted on the back is sometimes enough for some people. But it's nowhere near enough for Tommy.' </p> <p>McElnea concedes that the discipline necessary to succeed within the tight confines of the R6 Cup - there have been seven different winners this year - played a large part in the preparation necessary to deal with the cut and thrust of the BSB Championship. </p> <p>'It's so close and there is so much to lose in R6 that you have to be consistent and learn to put the bad days behind you and move on. That's what Tommy did last year,' says McElnea. 'He had that mindset from day one and that's definitely helped him this year. But, more than anything, it's the way he takes things on the chin. He's so gutted when things go wrong, whether it's his mistake or the bike lets him down, but, within 10 minutes, he's back round again, \"Let's go; next race.\" He has been a terrific example to the guys in this year's R6 Cup because he's shown what's possible.' </p> <p>McElnea, a hardened racing man, is so enthusiastic about Hill's progress that you suspect he will win a place on the works Yamaha team at the expense of one of the existing and more experienced riders in 2005. </p> <p>'Tommy has been a fantastic ambassador for everything we have done; not just the pure results and where he has got to, but his demeanour, the way he conducts himself, promotes himself,' says McElnea. 'The whole thing has come from this R6 academy. We go down to the grass roots, we find a Tommy Hill, the first year is a paid and financed berth from Yamaha and Virgin Mobile and, the following year, he steps into a Superbike team on merit. That's where he's at. I'm sure he'll get a ride in 2005. From there, who knows? World Superbike and then MotoGP. A British rider on the way up. And, in the meantime, we have Richard Wren coming through to take his turn. British bike racing couldn't ask for more.'</p>",
  "<p>At the height of David Mellor's indiscretions when he was a Tory minister, Ned Sherrin observed: 'He's doing all right with the ladies now, but what happens when he loses his looks?' It came to mind last week watching Jos\u00e9 Mourinho mastermind Chelsea's Champions League victory over Porto just as his predecessor Claudio Ranieri was throwing some light on goings-on at Stamford Bridge. </p> <p>Or rather in Monaco. In an extract from his book, Proud Man Walking (CollinsWillow \u00a316.99) - neat twist on the dead-man tag that the Italian was given for all of last season - Ranieri tells how he heard that Mourinho was being courted for his job on the eve of the semi-final first leg. To discover that the Portuguese coach was on board Roman Abramovich's yacht meeting the owner and the Chelsea chief executive, Peter Kenyon, clouded his judgment, Ranieri admits. </p> <p>Having borne stoically all the speculation, suddenly Ranieri was angry. He determined to pick an attacking side in an attempt to win the tie in 90 minutes and show the top brass what they would be losing. It was a fearful mistake. Selection was overly ambitious and the substitutions baffling. </p> <p>Remember Hern\u00e1n Crespo, Eidur Gudjohnsen and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink forming a front three as caution was thrown to the Mistral with Monaco down to 10 men? Scott Parker and Robert Huth, alternatively, at right-back? The indolent Juan Sebastian Ver\u00f3n replacing Jesper Gronkjaer, even though he had not played for months? Chelsea were beaten soundly and ultimately unable to rescue the return. </p> <p>It would be ludicrous even to consider that Ranieri deliberately threw away the game, but he certainly lost his focus. And it does make you wonder what leadership skills Abramovich and Kenyon were showing as they undermined their manager at such a crucial time. </p> <p>Then again, you wonder quite often in football what kind of leadership skills some people show. This crass episode involved a man with an apparently impressive track record in the game. Chief executive of Umbro, then Manchester United, Kenyon presided over an era of sound financial husbandry and playing success. </p> <p>The only mark against Kenyon when it came to headhunting for Chelsea was his statement once that 'having money is not necessarily the route to automatic success'. Sensible it might have been, but it would not have been what Abramovich wanted to hear. But if Kenyon can be so insensitive, what does it say of others not so successful or in-demand? It does show how few men of quality there are running the game. </p> <p>Abramovich, Ranieri said, was the perfect chairman - manager-speak, probably, for a man who did not interfere with his selection and tactics. 'Of Peter Kenyon, not so good,' he adds. 'We were never on the same wavelength, probably because I do not know very much about marketing and he does not know a great deal about matters on the field of play.' </p> <p>In between his obsessive studying of videos, monitoring the internet for information on opponents and compiling 10-page dossiers for his own players, Jos\u00e9 Mario Santos Mourinho Felix might be spending some time reading Ranieri's book for an insight into the potential machinations at Chelsea. </p> <p>This being a results business, the time will come - probably not soon, given Mourinho's start - when he, too, will be subjected to the internal politics and male bitchiness that beset most clubs, heightened at the highest level. Not that he seems to bothered as yet. By anything, in fact. </p> <p>Thus far, he has revealed himself as the Marmite of football. You either love him or hate him. Those who detest him speak of his sour appearance, his arrogant bearing, his outrageous statements. 'A narcissistic leader because he is convinced deep down that God gave him a special gift,' said one Portuguese psychologist. </p> <p>Personally, I am fond of Marmite. And negatives can be viewed another way. He is serious of countenance because he is a serious figure, his bearing is of self-certainty, his words spoken with a purpose. While the opposition and media are concentrating on what he has to say, he deflects the attention from his players by taking all the stress himself. </p> <p>In a week when Wayne Rooney has been compared to every Manchester United great (and add to it Billy Meredith from a century ago), Mourinho does evoke the still fresh memory of Brian Clough. His psychology is as intriguing. </p> <p>This week, for example, he took the bile, and sputum, of Porto fans still angry at his departure, merely accepting with the wisdom of experience that no matter what you do or say, some people in life are simply just not going to like you. He would probably recall how, in fact, he used it to advantage when he left Benfica for Porto and had to endure abuse on his return with his new team. 'In offloading against me, they ended up sparing the team, which was important,' he said. </p> <p>Mourinho seems well able to cope with the enormous stress on a football manager, even thriving on it. Finally, Chelsea may have a man unburdened by the flawed input of meddlers and who can take the club the extra mile towards significant silverware by sweeping away five decades of underachievement. </p> <p>The lack of a winning culture within the club has certainly contributed to that. Does it not occur to the powers that be that an atmosphere of insecurity among staff contributes to the eroding of a winning culture? </p> <p>It is one thing to achieve success on the field, quite another to survive the politics of a club should results turn for even a brief period, however. Then we will see how Mourinho copes with the internal demands, whether his generalship will stand him in as good stead in the corridors where stalk chief executives as on the field. </p> <p>Someone, Ranieri perhaps, having experience of the curious English diet, might explain to him that Marmite is particularly popular on toast.</p>",
  "<p>There is so much hype and hucksterism in modern football it is easy to be dismissive when the real thing comes along. As it did at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening. </p> <p>No one has seen anything resembling Wayne Rooney's Manchester United debut before, not in real life at any rate. All manner of comparisons have been dredged up all week, from Charlie Sagar in 1905 to George Best in 1963, but nothing in the dusty language of record books does justice to an 18-year-old who changed hands for \u00a327 million while nursing a foot injury and announced his return by hitting a 37-minute hat-trick in his first game in a United shirt. In front of 67,128 people. In the Champions League. The commentator who said Rooney was writing his own scripts had it exactly right, because what you need to place his extraordinary feats in context is not a knowledge of history but a familiarity with fictional sporting improbabilities, from the Rocky films to Roy of the Rovers , with a touch of Billy's Boots thrown in. </p> <p>Even if the Fenerbahce defence was not the most rigorously drilled of units in Tuesday's 6-2 defeat, and even if Rooney struggles for the rest of the season to live up to this most audacious of openings, it would appear the former Everton forward is every bit as good as everyone hoped he would be. One hesitates to suggest that anyone can be worth every penny of \u00a327m, but set against some of Manchester United's other acquisitions in the past few years, Rooney looks definite value for money. And if this is just the beginning, who knows what he might go on to achieve for United and England in the next few years. </p> <p>Instead of burdening the youngster with a nation's hopes and dreams for the future, however, let us simply reflect on what Rooney's impact might have changed already. Whichever way you look at it, life after 28 September 2004 is never going to be quite the same again for anyone. Rooney wears a Manchester United shirt with the number eight on the back, so here are eight ways in which Wayne's World will differ from the one we knew before Tuesday. </p> <p> <strong> 1 Neutral football supporters will have to start liking Manchester United.</strong> </p> <p> This may be a difficult concept to grasp on Merseyside, especially at the moment, but if United have in their possession the most exciting young player in England then English football followers will have no choice but to warm to them. It is not such a revolutionary notion in any case, since the same thing almost happened a decade ago when Eric Cantona was at the height of his popularity. United icons since have been less universally admired, but Rooney does not have a dark side, like Roy Keane; a thespian side, like Ruud van Nistelrooy; a feminine side, like David Beckham; or a strident side like Gary Neville. </p> <p>Depending on which tabloid you read you might surmise Rooney has something of a wild side, although compared with what Newcastle players used to get up to on their nights out there is something old-fashioned and almost homely about a footballer actually paying for sex at his local street-corner outlet. That is exactly what Rooney is - an old-fashioned footballer. Gauche, impressionable, slightly clumsy in company, yet transformed on the pitch into an imperious and gifted giant. As the United chief executive, David Gill, said last week, without intending to be unkind, it is fairly clear the boy's brains are all in his feet. </p> <p>You know where you stand with a player like that. You know you will not find Rooney wearing a skirt, or his wife's knickers. He's uncomplicated. He just plays football, very well, as even Everton fans will now have to admit. He may have left Goodison too early, and he may have added insult to injury by claiming he needed to play at a higher level. But when he got to that higher level he didn't fall flat on his face, did he? He didn't just talk the talk, he walked the walk, and Everton supporters will now have to respect that. At least when he said higher level, he didn't mean Liverpool. What's not to like? </p> <p> <strong> 2 Manchester United fans will have to start supporting England.</strong> </p> <p> What do you mean, you thought they did already? Have you never heard their chants about where you can stuff your effin' England? Apparently United fans consider their club to be a bigger, better, more cosmopolitan and more attractive proposition than the national team, and delight in mocking smaller clubs for lending support to the army of small-town racists and thugs who follow England. Sir Alex Ferguson's frequent disputes with national managers, Rio Ferdinand's ban and David Beckham's treatment after the 1998 World Cup also added fuel to the fire. </p> <p>All this nonsense will now have to stop if Rooney is the new Bobby Charlton. As with Charlton, Rooney seems set to become synonymous with both United and England, the one inseparable from the other. Did United fans ever turn against Ireland, even when Roy Keane did? No. They have too much respect for Keane, and enjoy watching him in any situation. The same will happen with Rooney. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Manchester United will have to change formation and shape the team around Rooney.</strong> </p> <p> Rooney may score goals, lots of them and most of them spectacular, but he is not a striker. That is to say, he does not make runs to the near post, get on the end of many crosses or look to score most of his goals from in and around the six-yard box. Rooney is more of an attacking midfielder in the Bobby Charlton mode. He has the same ability to make room for himself outside the penalty area and the same unstoppable shot. He can score tap-ins and headers too, but that is not his forte. </p> <p>Watch a replay of United's opening goal against Fenerbahce and check Rooney's position when Kleberson makes his break down the left. Ryan Giggs makes the striker's run and scores with a deftly taken header, whereas Rooney can be seen 10 or 15 yards behind, ambling towards the penalty area with his arm raised to signal he wants the ball. The way Rooney played on Tuesday he would probably have scored had Kleberson passed to him instead of Giggs, but that would have been perverse. Giggs made the conventional striker's run, and was rewarded with a conventional striker's goal. </p> <p>It does not say much for Rooney's striking instincts that a converted winger was so much quicker off the mark. Yet Rooney is effective, will get goals, and cannot be left out of the team. United's usual 4-4-2 became a 4-4-1-1 on Tuesday, with Ruud van Nistelrooy on his own at the front and Rooney operating deeper. That is the way they are likely to continue, unless Sir Alex Ferguson wants to experiment with two strikers and Rooney playing from advanced midfield in the hole. </p> <p> <strong> 4 There will be a surge in England's popularity.</strong> </p> <p> Yes, another one. Just when you thought it was safe to agree with Steven Gerrard and not get particularly excited about England until they prove capable of getting through a quarter-final, along comes someone capable of making anything seem possible. If Rooney carries on as he did for England in the summer and as he did in his first game for Manchester United, then just about everyone in the country is going to want to see him in the flesh. England tickets will be snapped up particularly quickly, even for friendly games, and embarrassments such as the empty seats for England v Ukraine at Newcastle this season will be a thing of the past. Always assuming Ferguson releases him for England friendlies, of course. </p> <p> <strong> 5 There will be a surge in Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's popularity.</strong> </p> <p> Rooney can win matches for England, we saw that in Portugal, and if England are winning matches then their manager is bound to be popular. Even if he is overpaid, oversexed and over here. </p> <p>Eriksson deserves his due for being quicker than many a national manager to recognise the teenager's talent and put him straight into the England team. On 19 October 2002, Rooney scored the winning goal for Everton against Arsenal that propelled him into the national consciousness. He was still a few days short of his seventeenth birthday. Five months later he was making his England debut in the next available friendly, against Australia, and two months after that he was playing a significant part in the 2-0 victory over Turkey in Sunderland. The rest is history, although it is fair to suggest that previous England managers might have made Rooney wait longer for his opportunity. Both Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan held back Michael Owen a little longer than was necessary, and Keegan in particular seemed perfectly content to have an England team full of thirtysomethings. </p> <p>Eriksson appears to be the opposite, happy to have one of the youngest teams around, which is why those who worry Jermain Defoe will not get his chance are probably fretting unnecessarily. Introducing Rooney and being proved right will always look good on the Eriksson CV, which possibly explains why the England manager was so animated in the Old Trafford stand when the third goal went in against Fenerbahce. Whether it was luck or judgment is another matter. Eriksson's options at the time included Darius Vassel, James Beattie, Alan Smith and Emile Heskey. What would you have done? </p> <p> <strong> 6 Manchester United's season is saved already.</strong> </p> <p> Suddenly no one is talking about a seven-point gap any more. The fact that United have just made their worst ever start to a Premiership season no longer seems to matter. Just about anything is still possible, and even if Arsenal go another season unbeaten and hang on to their lead at the top of the Premiership, they haven't got Wayne Rooney. Equally, even if United flop in the Champions League and fail to lift a trophy all season, they still seem to have secured a major prize. More than anything else, United like to be the team who are talked about. No one has spent the past week talking about Arsenal's latest Champions League performance. </p> <p> <strong> 7 People can stop talking twaddle and writing pretentious books about Real Madrid.</strong> </p> <p> Manchester United are the new Real Madrid. And not just because they are spoilt for choice in attack yet embarrassingly inept in defence. United are the biggest football club in the world who still behave like a football club and not some extension of Hollywood. Ferguson has spent most of his United career in awe of Real Madrid, partly because he saw them in the flesh in the unforgettable European Cup final at Hampden Park in 1960, partly because they have been out of everyone else's league in recent years in terms of buying the world's best players and monopolising the Champions League. Those days are over. The galacticos are growing old, Madrid is a club in trouble and Manchester is where the excitement is. </p> <p>This may be a slight exaggeration, in view of the fact that Arsenal and Chelsea are quite exciting too, but in the European shopping contest United have outbought Real Madrid in the past couple of seasons. Who would you rather have in your team at the moment (or not in your team, in the case of Jonathan Woodgate and Michael Owen) - Real's trio of mostly non-playing Englishmen, or the potentially deadly double act of Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo? </p> <p> <strong> 8 An end to punning headline misery.</strong> </p> <p> The downside to Rooney's success has been the dire sequence of dreadful puns on his surname that have accompanied his every move since becoming an England regular. You know the sort of thing. Roomania. Over the Roon. Roomarkable. Roo of the Rovers. I only have eyes for Roo. We're throo. Roo what a scorcher. Roo Beauty. Roo's sorry now? Roonsacked. Heroo. Roobarb and Custard. OK, I made the last one up. Well, either the supply has finally dried up, or the player is now viewed with so much respect that treatment like this appears tacky. Congratulations to Rooney for producing enough news, one way or the other, to exhaust the English language. First edition headline in the Sun on Wednesday morning: It's Wayneing Goals!</p>",
  "Yorkshire's booming unofficial capital city of Leeds is facing the gradual sidelining of one of its greatest assets, the delicate maze of alleys and yards which thread - often unnoticed by locals and visitors alike - between the bustling streets of Briggate and Vicar Lane. <p>Fear of crime and vandalism, including arson attacks on commercial rubbish skips left overnight in many of the narrow passages, have led to security gates and in one case the closure of a 300-year-old alley and its incorporation into the shopfront of a building society branch. </p> <p>The creeping threat to the 'loins', Yorkshire dialect for lanes which led to the traditional nickname for Leeds people of 'Loiners', has been helped unwittingly by the city's success as a tourist and shopping magnet in the last decade. The much-praised renovation of its Victorian arcades has overshadowed the humbler passageways next door. </p> <p>'The alleys and yards perhaps don't have such an obvious appeal,' says Dr Kevin Grady of Leeds Civic Trust, which has long been vigilant over any development threat to the showpiece arcades. The attractions of these include a magnificent automated clock which uses mechanical figures from Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe to chime the quarters and a frieze of pomegranates which the city council, muddling its fruits, once repainted orange instead of pinky-red. </p> <p>'The alleys are intriguing and important,' says Dr Grady. 'Both as a reminder of Leeds' pre-Victorian town plan and the hiding place of some remarkable treasures.' </p> <p>Among these are the last timber-framed buildings to survive in the city centre, curious 'urban furniture' such as a wrought iron loading crane and a retractable Victorian fire escape, and the celebrated City Varieties music hall made famous by the TV series The Good Old Days . </p> <p>The passageways also hide a hallowed institution whose changing fortunes have finally alerted local opinion to the changing state of the 'loins' - Whitelock's First City Luncheon Bar which runs the length of a classic off-Briggate alley, Turk's Head Yard. Listed in guidebooks such as Great Bars of the World, the pub is now at the centre of a huge furore over changes proposed by its new owners, the youth-focused Spirit Group </p> <p>'They want to get rid of our pies and puddings,' says Barrie Pepper, a former Leeds city councillor and stalwart of the Campaign for Real Ale who has written a dozen books on Yorkshire pubs. More than 1,500 people have signed a petition against the group's proposal to target young professionals with a 'city day pub', replacing Yorkshire Pudding and jam roly poly with fetuccini and white wine. </p> <p>The change for the alleyway would be secondary, but traditionalists fear that its homely clutter of beer-drinkers' benches, flower tubs and an amateur mural - feted in their day by the poet Sir John Betjeman and the novelist Keith Waterhouse - could be cleared away. There is another danger, too, says Mata Haggs, a Whitelock's enthusiast and one of the early signers of the petition to Spirit. </p> <p>'If you succeed in attracting a mid-twenties bar crowd you will also attract the number of fights, under-age drinkers, and drug problems that come with them,' she says. 'Is it worth destroying a pub of historic character to gain this?' </p> <p>Moves to gate the alleys have been given impetus by exactly that fear of dealers, muggers or the drunks who turn parts of central Leeds into a raucous mess late at night. The narrow twists between high buildings are seen as classic 'dark sidestreets' to avoid as well as serving as unofficial public lavatories. </p> <p>The complete closure of one end of Change Alley, which threaded behind the old regional stock exchange like a humbler version of the City of London's Exchange Alley, followed a spate of such problems. Its stone-carved gateway was finally bricked in after a rubbish fire which melted a drainpipe and threatened the ancient Leeds Library, founded by 18th century luminaries including Joseph Priestley, the discov erer of oxygen. </p> <p>Leeds city council, which changed in June from Labour to an unusually broad coalition of Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and Greens, has a good reputation for pre serving the city's central heritage, and campaigners are hopeful that the 'gating' pressure will be reversed. Signs are currently going up round a central cordon warning of a new ban on drinking in the street, with \u00a350 on-the-spot penalties, which comes into force next month. </p> <p>High profile security patrols meanwhile check out the alleys, along with the rest of the central pedestrian precinct. And councillors highlight the success of showpiece alleys such as the gas-lit Angel Inn Yard and cobbled Queen's Court, close to the old cloth market which Daniel Defoe described as 'a prodigy of its kind unequalled in the world.' </p> <p>The city has noted, too, the economic success of a similar web of passages in York, where they are known as 'snickelways', and Hull, which attracts tourists by the romance of narrow streets with names such as The Land of Green Ginger. As Dr Grady says, the treasures waiting to be found up Leeds' alleys are surprising: Pack Horse Yard, for instance, has the former home of Joseph Aspdin (1788-1855) and a long plaque detailing how he invented Portland cement.</p>",

  "Imagination, fantasy and poetic licence were ingredients that made Peter Pan a classic. Now a Hollywood blockbuster, Finding Neverland, which focuses on its author, JM Barrie, has been accused of taking those same elements too far. <p>The movie stars American heart-throb Johnny Depp as Barrie, who was Scottish, and Kate Winslet as Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, whose sons inspired the characters of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys, first seen in 1904. Barrie, who never had children of his own, met the boys in Kensington Gardens in London and became their playmate, developing a curious attachment which contributed to the collapse of his marriage. </p> <p>The characters in the film are based on real people, including American theatre impresario Charles Frohman, played by Dustin Hoffman, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes. Many biographical details are diligently researched, yet in several important respects the screenplay departs from the historical record. </p> <p>When Barrie first meets Sylvia she is recently widowed, having lost her husband to cancer; in reality, Arthur Llewelyn Davies was still very much alive and, according to some accounts, suspicious of the man lavishing so much affection on his wife and children. The film portrays four Llewelyn Davies boys, when in truth there were five. Mary Hodgson, the boys' nanny whom one of them described as the most important person in their lives after the mother, does not appear at all. </p> <p>The film's production company, Harvey Weinstein's Miramax, insists it is meant to be a 'fictional retelling' rather than a biopic, but descendants of the Llewelyn Davies family expressed disappointment. 'It's a pity they didn't stick to the facts,' said Lady (Tessa) Montgomery, 71, great-niece of Sylvia, whose death in 1910 left Barrie to care for the boys. Films have a habit of rewriting history. People rewrite even slightly the story or a character and often the family find it's not the person they remember or know about.' </p> <p>Lady Montgomery, whose father-in-law was Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, also objected to the portrayal of her great-grandmother, Emma du Maurier. Played by Julie Christie as a steely matriarch, du Maurier spends much of the film bullying Sylvia, and trying to keep Barrie away from the boys, before finally melting. Told about the representation, Lady Montgomery, who has not yet seen the film, said: 'Judging by the letters to her from her son, Gerald du Maurier, she sounds a very affectionate and kind mother, so that's rather hard. </p> <p>In one scene, when she is angrily waving a coat hanger, du Maurier becomes the source of Barrie's inspiration for the evil Captain Hook. 'I do think that's really rather ridiculous,' Lady Montgomery added. 'She might well be spinning in her grave.' </p> <p>Kits Browning, 63, brother of Lady Montgomery - their mother was the novelist Daphne du Maurier - also raised concerns: 'In the 1970s Ian Holm played Barrie in a BBC series, The Lost Boys, by Andrew Birkin. He was somebody who would stick to the facts. It's very different when you get somebody in America who knows nothing about the family and is simply commissioned to write a screenplay. They don't care what happens so long as it puts bums on seats. They can shoot anything that is commercial and appeals to the American cinema audience, which is basically 15 to 30.' </p> <p>Browning, himself a film maker who now runs the annual Du Maurier festival, added: 'With a lot of these things, once they're taken over by a film company, you just have no control at all.' </p> <p>Beryl Bainbridge, whose novel An Awfully Big Adventure was partly inspired by Peter Pan , condemned Finding Neverland. 'If you're going to do \"the life of\", you can have your own ideas but you can't alter facts.' </p> <p>The film's screenwriter, David Magee, whose credits include the action adventure Crisis Four , defended his approach: 'The screenplay I wrote is not a factual retelling of what happened to James Barrie when he wrote Peter Pan. I wanted to tell a story about what it means to grow up and become responsible for those around you. </p> <p>'We made it so the boys' father died before the film starts because we thought having two horrible things happen to these children would be too much in a two-hour time frame. The character of Emma du Maurier totally has my sympathy and I hope she is beautifully redeemed in the end scenes. I never intended any character to be a villain in any way. </p> <p>'It's a creative fantasy about children who grow up too quickly and a man who hasn't been able to grow up. I hope JM Barrie would respect what we tried to do.'</p>",
  "When Sophie McKenzie decided to start teaching at High View School in Derby, her mother cried and begged her not to ruin her career. <p>Last year the school was the third worst-performing in Britain. Bullying was rife, teachers resigned rather than be intimidated by both pupils and parents, and the majority of lessons were desperate exercises in crowd control.</p> <p>By the time High View was put into special measures - that is, judged by Ofsted to be failing or likely to fail to provide an acceptable standard of education - in January 2002, there had been a mass exodus of teachers and an increasing number of parents refused to send their children there.</p> <p>Last week the school offered The Observer unprecedented access by inviting a reporter to join its staff as a teaching assistant. It wanted to explain how a school in such a critical state could pull itself round. It also wanted people to know what it was like to teach in an institution with such problems.</p> <p>High View's 500 pupils come from an area with high levels of social and economic disadvantage; almost half are eligible for free school meals, while 34 per cent have special educational needs, more than twice the national average.</p> <p>In 1997 an Ofsted inspection judged the school had 'serious weaknesses', the final stage before special measures. With the head teacher unable to provide the leadership for its improvement, it began to implode. When Ofsted placed it in special measures, under which it came under the direct control of the Department for Education and Skills, a third of the teachers fled, forcing the school to double up lessons and rely on supply teachers. In 2003, only 7 per cent of pupils gained 5+ A*-C GCSE grades - a fall on the previous year's rock-bottom 12 per cent.</p> <p>In August, Derby city local education authority announced the closure of High View, reopening it last month under a new name with a new headteacher, management team and staffing structure. The closure threatened the jobs of all who worked at the school. Morale sank and strike action was threatened.</p> <p>'It was awful,' said Bob Randle, High View deputy head, now vice-principal at the new Da Vinci Community College. 'There was unspoken agreement between teachers, children and the community that this school produced failures. It was humiliating and depressing. I am still recovering from that period.' Pupils also suffered: 'People laugh at us for coming here,' said Kim Bousfield, 16. 'They think we're thick, but I don't care.' She does care, of course; all the students do.</p> <p>Although more state schools were put into special measures last year than any since Labour came to power, it is still extremely rare for a school to fail so completely - only 300 out of 22,000 triggered the status last year - and the effect is devastating. Pupils now in their first year are unaware of the chaos preceding their admission, but those who experienced even one year of the previous regime suffer its effect.</p> <p>'I'm not clever,' whispered one 12-year-old girl paralysed in fear at being asked to pick out the metaphors and similes in a poem. 'I don't understand anything.'</p> <p>Lack of self-esteem increases as pupils get older. By 16, most of the children are generally depressed about their inability to succeed. 'Our year 11 students have been through the most dramatic years in this school's history,' said Becky Murdoch, who joined at Easter as vice-principal. 'They have had a raw deal through no fault of their own, but through a really terrible set of circumstances. It's been awful for them.'</p> <p>It will take more than a new name, of course, to reconstruct the school's reputation and raise attainment. Not long ago only one 11-year-old out of a year's new intake of 100-plus children had the verbal reasoning skills expected for that age. On average, new pupils had reading skills two years below their chronological age.</p> <p>Da Vinci is an extreme example of why an influential committee of MPs called for extra pay to be made available to lure high-quality teachers into troubled inner-city secondary schools. When High View advertised for teachers, sometimes just a single applicant would apply. 'We need the absolute highest quality because they won't survive here otherwise,' said Randle. </p> <p>Arriving for my first day, I was expecting classrooms under siege by pupils who fought and brawled with a complete lack of respect for their teachers and each other. Instead, children smartly dressed in colour co-ordinated uniforms flowed between classes with only the normal jostling common to any school day, raising their voices only to cheerfully greet a teacher at the far end of a corridor. </p> <p>'We don't have hard, nasty kids here, but we have desperately needy ones,' said Randle. 'Their behaviour is just attention-seeking, but responding to their constant need for support and affirmation is like being sucked dry. Their self-esteem is so brittle that it doesn't take very much to knock it; when that happens, they sometimes react aggressively, which can be scary if you're not used to it.' </p> <p>When Da Vinci opened, it was under executive head Carol Dibbs, head of Lees Brook Community Sports College, a successful neighbouring school. She has worked in challenging schools all her career and her reputation is such that, when word spread she had taken over, teachers began to apply for posts at the school for the first time in years. Dibbs's approach is tough but simple, and in June, with the same teachers, the school came out of special measures in record time. </p> <p>'My approach is pretty straightforward,' said Dibbs. 'We focused on improving teaching and learning and providing a clear educational direction while improving students' progress, behaviour, attendance and attitudes.' </p> <p>She introduced strict rules and clear boundaries, giving teachers total support. The rules include a firm insistence on politeness and respect and wearing correct dress code. Swearing, aggressive behaviour and bullying are not tolerated; disruptive behaviour in lessons is dealt with swiftly. There is a full quota of permanent staff with none planning to leave. </p> <p>'My mother cried when I said I was coming here, but all she saw was a failing school; she didn't see what was on the inside,' said McKenzie, student progress and achievement manager for year 7 pupils and English teacher. 'There were times when it would have been easy to leave, but this school takes hold of you. I know what these children's lives are like at home, and I know that when they go back there after the school day is over, I have made a real difference.' </p> <p>From The Observer's time at the school, that lure is clear. Asked to read the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet , a GCSE English student, who has chosen to sit at the back of the class, shoved her book across the table in disgust. 'I don't understand any of this,' she spat. 'I'm just too stupid.' It took time to coax her to take her head out of her hands, but by the end of the lesson she and I had worked out how Romeo uses the image of the sun to refer to Juliet, then draws the stars and heavens into his metaphor. </p> <p>'I guess he uses such stupid words because he feels so strongly about Juliet that normal words won't do,' she mused, leafing through the play to see what comes next. 'I wish someone felt that strongly towards me. Thanks, miss,' she said, looking straight at me for the first time and smiling. 'That was good.' </p> <p>The school's walls are plastered with displays dedicated to building the children's self-esteem. 'Who I Am Is Important', one child has written. 'I am a good friend', says another. 'My teacher says I work hard', another announces proudly. The June Ofsted inspection that removed the school from special measures - seven months after Dibbs took over - praised the improvements. 'Acceptable behaviour has become the norm,' it drily announced. </p> <p>Dibbs put it better: 'We have created a disciplined and caring environment, where pupils' self-confidence is being rebuilt.' A year 11 student put it better still: 'It might have been bad before, but it's really good now. I'm glad this is my school. No, it's more than that - I'm proud it's my school.'</p>",
  "<p>My dad was a bad boy. He knew that. There was no hidden agenda. It's good to be bad.</p> <p>I enjoyed posing naked for Playboy in 1995. I would recommend it to others. They take very good care of you and you come away feeling good about yourself. But I'd caution women to have picture approval. I wouldn't have done it otherwise. I'm too shy. </p> <p>My father was not in the Mafia. It's absurd. He had an FBI file two storeys high and it was all garbage. Kitty Kelley took all of that crap and put it in one volume. She never asked me to dispute any of it. She only went to the people who were disgruntled by him. She's the C-word and I hate her. If I ever met her... I don't know what I'd do. She's just scum.</p> <p>My dad brought a lot of his bad reputation on himself. He was treated so shabbily by so many people. </p> <p>The right-wing press in America was out to get him and kill him if they could, because he was a powerful ally for people like Roosevelt and Kennedy. J Edgar Hoover and people like that resented him because he spoke out. They called him a communist as early as 1942. He was one of the first performers to publicly support candidates and they wanted to discredit him. It's not unlike what [Kenneth] Starr did to Bill Clinton. My father chose not to defend himself against those people. It drove me crazy. </p> <p>It's sad because, to this day, when new generations do a search on the internet they find a lot of garbage. You can't unring a bell. That shit is out there.</p> <p>My old songs are kinda brilliant. I can say that because I didn't write them. What does 'Some Velvet Morning' mean? I don't really know what it means. It's just my mentor Lee Hazlewood's fantasy, a guy with a muse trying to tap into the drug culture.</p> <p>Single motherhood is tough. I retired in 1972 because I was trying to have children and had some trouble with that. That's a long, complicated, boring story about pregnancies and stuff. But, once they came, I believed in stuff like the PTA and the Brownies. I thought that if I screwed this up, what was the point of motherhood? They've grown up happy and independent people, so I would not trade the time I spent with them. </p> <p>All of us who knew Elvis thought we could've done something to help him. I wish I'd stayed in closer touch.</p> <p>I never saw any discord between my father and Elvis. They were friends from the time Elvis did my dad's TV show in 1959. The only comment I ever heard from my dad about Elvis's music was that he didn't grow musically, and he wished he had because then Elvis's life may not have ended when it did. My father said some pretty harsh things. He'd probably had a few Jack Daniel's when he said them. </p> <p>I've met six presidents. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Bill Clinton, and both George Bushes. Bill Clinton was my favourite, no question. I saw him recently getting off a plane in New York. He gave me a big bear hug and offered me a lift. I just adore him. A wonderful, warm, fine man, very much like my father and Elvis. The energy, the humour, the sparkle in his eyes. </p> <p>I hate the Iraq war. I hate it. American soldiers fighting in this war are coming home suffering the same pain that people of my generation suffered in Vietnam. The only difference is that they're not having eggs thrown at them by the American public. But they are just as emotionally scarred. It never ever stops. I've come to the conclusion that it will only stop if there's a threat from another planet. </p> <p>I dated Phil Spector. He's a wonderful man. I don't know what happened on the night that he's been accused of shooting his girlfriend, I've never asked him. But I never for a minute believed he could do such a thing. It's like Michael Jackson - I don't know him but I know in my heart he's not like that. </p> <p>I've got hip taste because I had two teenage daughters who played their music to me. We had a Smiths poster hanging in our house for years. So I knew who Morrissey was when he came calling on me in London. I didn't feel stupid, for a change. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Nancy Sinatra's new album, Nancy Sinatra, is released on the Attack label tomorrow</p>",
  "<p>My sister lives a couple of hours down the M4 from me, and in our frequent phone calls I have noticed that neither of us discusses our health any more. The reason for our recent reluctance to moan about our illnesses and aches and pains as we used to is that, more often than not, it will mean the other developing either the same illness or symptoms of it. We have always been close, with the usual intense loyalty and rivalry involved with sisters only two-and-a-half years apart. But it is more than just sympathy pains. (I know what those are because I get shooting pains for a couple of minutes down the back of my legs if one of my children or my nephews gets the tiniest graze.) What we experience could more accurately be called empathy pains, because we feel characteristics of pain or discomfort exactly like those the other is experiencing.</p> <p>It all started a few years ago, when I had to spend a few days in hospital with a painful kidney infection which needed treatment with antibiotics. Not long afterwards, my sister developed exactly the same infection with the same intense pain and sickly sweet smell on her skin. Blood and protein were also found in her urine - her ailment was every bit as real as mine.</p> <p>Next was my sister's severe high abdominal pain that she was told was gallstones, and my copycat symptoms - I spent a night in a hot bath screaming at my husband that it was worse than giving birth. Then came my broken left armand the pain in her left arm that was so intense she had to have cortisone injected into her elbow. There have been the uncomfortable, worrying, skipping heartbeats that I got after she had told me about palpitations that woke her in the night (we both ended up attached to an ECG machine). But perhaps the oddest thing was that her periods also stopped when I was pregnant and only started again when I miscarried.</p> <p>We are both slightly embarrassed about all this. We know that it is not a psychic link because we have only felt the pain when we have been told about it by the other. Freud would probably have diagnosed us as hysterics and I must admit that, looking at the list of shared illnesses, it does seem pretty highly strung. Although I have always been wary of overstressing the link between the mind and illness, I have to admit that it is likely that the emotional link between us might well have something to do with our mirrored pain.</p> <p>Beatrice Robertson, a private family therapist who has experience in dealing with the complicated relationships of adult siblings, says studies have shown that sometimes, if one sibling is ill, the well sibling takes on symptoms of that illness out of a kind of survivor's guilt. 'I once read about a well sister having exactly the same pains as her sister who was crippled by arthritis, even though she did not have it herself,' says Robertson. 'Although her sister was much better and leading an independent life, she was full of guilt at being able-bodied in childhood when her sister could not walk and had to crawl across the room.'</p> <p>I tell her that neither my sister nor I suffer from a great deal of guilt towards each other and that neither is noticeably better off either emotionally or financially than the other. Beatrice is interested in the fact that my sister's periods stopped when I was pregnant because she sees a similarity with men who suffer symptoms of pregnancy - backache, weight gain, nausea and abdominal cramps - a phenomenon known as Couvade syndrome. </p> <p>'The partner of a pregnant woman wants to take away the pain of his wife, experience what she is feeling, and possibly get some of the attention she is being given,' she explains. 'Both you and your sister want to stop the other's discomfort by taking responsibility for it because you love each other and at the same time have some competitive residue left from your childhood. You know how children fight for their mother's sympathy? Well, perhaps you are still carrying on doing that to a certain extent.'</p> <p>Possibly, but I would prefer to think that now we're both past our 40th birthdays and have our own children, we've grown out of wanting our mother's attention so much that it would actually make us feel pain or fall ill. More acceptable to both of us is research carried out this year at University College London which showed that women were capable of not only sympathising with another's pain but actually 'feeling' it.</p> <p>The team first delivered an electric shock to the hands of 16 women and observed their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), and then gave an electric shock to each of their partners. The women were allowed to see the shock being administered, but were prevented from watching their partner's face during the treatment in case this influenced them. Even so, the women's brains lit up the same emotional areas as when their own hand was being shocked. Lead researcher Dr Tani Singer said: 'The results suggest that we use emotional representations reflecting our own subjective feeling states to understand the feelings of others.' He emphasised that the response seemed to be greater in those with an intense emotional bond. </p> <p>I ring up my sister and tell her that it is simply our close connection rather than our competitiveness that makes us ill with the same things at the same time. She is pleased. When I put the phone down I decide to ring my mother and tell her what fond and caring daughters she has. The phone is engaged, and when I ring my sister back, her line is busy, too. My sister has got there first.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe I've been working from home for too long, but offices have always been a mystery to me. I must have wandered through a good 30 in the course of my career, on some pretext or other, and more often than not I've been paralysed with social inadequacy. </p> <p>What am I supposed to do in this strange place where many people gather but there is no bar? How am I supposed to cope with a whole room full of sober people, or at least people heroically pretending to be sober (you know who you are)? </p> <p>What I'd like to happen, my fantasy office visit as it were, is to waft about looking exciting and charismatic, 'making people's days' as I drop by their desks, making erudite comments on the state of the nation and telling jokes that make the whole office roar with laughter. And after I leave, they would say things like: 'I wish she would come in more often - she is a breath of fresh air.' </p> <p>For some reason, when I imagine this, there are always a lot of balloons and ticker tape, maybe a steel band playing in the background, like I have not merely popped into the office, but have actually been made president of the United States. In reality, of course, my visits to the office are mainly defined by a lot of gormless mooching about, sitting in chairs people need, chain-smoking in stairwells, and generally drifting about, getting in the way until finally I am led away and shoved gently into the lift.</p> <p>It's not that I hate offices, it's just that they always make me uncomfortably aware that I have no real role; while I'm in one, I'm just one of life's understudies, waiting for the leading lady to catch flu.</p> <p>Well, that's enough of my inadequacy in offices - how about yours? A recent study revealed that people in offices spend up to two hours a day dealing with personal emails and attending to 'non-professional business'. Me thinks this is a conservative estimate. Certainly when I've been into offices, there's seemed to be an awful lot of hiding behind large cheese plants going on - usually by men whose need to read the sports pages has become a matter of professional urgency. </p> <p>Then there are those managers you hear about who solemnly close their office doors, giving the impression they have lofty things to consider, matters far beyond the common man, and you peek in a bit later and they're tucking into a cream bun or watching The Sopranos on their lap-top. </p> <p>Most prevalent of all are those people you see walking around 'looking purposeful' with sheaves of papers clutched to their chest. Five minutes later, you see them again, still 'looking purposeful', coming back in the opposite direction. 'How could that be possible?' you think. How can someone have something to be purposeful about waiting at one end of the office, and then, five minutes later, have something to be equally purposeful about waiting at the other end? Personally, I can go from one year to the next without feeling any sense of purpose at all. Finally, it hits you: it's part of their job to walk around 'looking purposeful'.</p> <p>Either that, or someone nicked their cheese plant and they're looking for a quiet place to read Nuts. It would seem that office life, the supposed coalface of white-collar endeavour, is not always the hive of industry it purports to be. For a lot of you out there, a lot of the time, it's just one big skive - a chance to pick up your emails and flirt with someone who is not your spouse.</p> <p>Even weirder, quite a lot of the time people work hardest of all at looking like they're working hard, a concept which is difficult to understand when one works from home. Lazy Trisha-watching inadequates in crumb-strewn bobbly jumpers we might be, but at least we are not so crazy as to waste our days pretending to work, mainly because there's no one around to pretend to. So when we're not working, we're not working, and when we are working we are working, which seems the sane way to go about things. </p> <p>Admittedly, sometimes this 'not working' thing can get a little out of hand, but if I want to spend all day staring into space making strange sandwiches and rehearsing brilliant put-downs to people I haven't seen in five years, that's my business. Which probably explains why I could never be in an office: because I don't know how to pretend I'm working, things could swiftly turn sour. </p> <p>I'd end up getting sacked, or taken away by smiling strangers. While there are clear benefits to working in an office, not least having lots of people to borrow money from, on the whole it seems best, safer, to stay home to work (and skive) in peace.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

The better of the two is the Porter film, Irwin Winkler's <strong> De-Lovely</strong>, chiefly because there are a couple of dozen songs here by one of the greatest composer-lyricists of all time. </p> <p>Fundamentally, De-Lovely is like one of those songbook stage shows built around an artist's oeuvre. These have been a theatrical staple for the past 30-odd years (one called Cole ran for a couple of years in the 1970s), in which the numbers are linked by thin slices of biography. </p> <p>The narrative device follows It's a Wonderful Life, Carousel and the John Belushi biopic, Wired, by having an angel conduct the subject on a review of his life, in this case, a suave Gabriel (aka 'Gabe', played by Jonathan Pryce) with the elderly wheelchair-borne Cole Porter (Kevin Kline). </p> <p>Unlike the better 1946 biopic, Night and Day, starring Cary Grant, this one makes a big point of the bisexuality that made problems for his marriage to the long-suffering Linda (Ashley Judd). Apart from Kline and Judd, the cast is entirely British. </p> <p>The film lumbers over a period of some 46 years, from 1918 to 1964, but there is no reference to the two world wars or the Depression, and only the cars mark the passage of time and social change. The songs, attractively arranged by Stephen Endelman, are mostly used thematically, not chronologically, and where they're not sung by Kline, they're performed by a variety of youngish singing stars, including Natalie Cole, Elvis Costello and Robbie Williams. Only Sheryl Crow's 'Begin the Beguine' struck me as a dud, though it's never been a favourite of mine. </p> <p>Stephen Hopkins's <strong> The Life and Death of Peter Sellers</strong> is a largely unfunny film about a very funny man. The only really laugh-out-loud sequence comes on a plane trip to Rome, during which Sellers (Geoffrey Rush) decides on his interpretation of Inspector Clouseau and proceeds to inflict it on a stewardess and fellow passengers. The film follows Sellers from his radio stardom with The Goons in the early 50s (staggeringly unfunny) up to his penultimate screen appearance in Being There, a portrait of a man with no real identity, which he regarded as the peak of his career. </p> <p>Presented as a victim of an overbearing mother constantly condemning her husband as a failure, Sellers comes over as an egotistical child, wilful, self-deceiving, and only real when engaged in impersonation. The film's central device is to have Sellers looking at this film of his life. Between takes during its shooting, he assumes the roles of his first wife, his mother, father, Stanley Kubrick and Blake Edwards, rewriting their scripts to present himself in a better light. </p> <p>In addition, Rush also plays Sellers in brief extracts from some of his most famous pictures - the young crook in The Ladykillers, the duchess in The Mouse That Roared, Dr Strangelove, US President Muffly, Clouseau and others. His performance is a tour de force in an otherwise negligible, pompous picture that casts no fresh light on Sellers or his times. </p> <p>San Francisco-based heavy metal band Metallica formed in 1981, have sold millions of albums and were once nicknamed 'Alcoholica' for the booze and drugs they downed. Two of the founders are still there, one was kicked out, one was killed in a road accident on tour in Sweden and one left to do his own thing in 2001. </p> <p>The documentary <strong> Metallica: Some Kind of Monster</strong>, over which the band exercised complete editorial control, was made over two years during which they worked on their first album of this century and then embarked on their first tour since the 1990s. The picture is like This Is Spinal Tap for real, an unintentionally hilarious excursion into the lives of a group of self-regarding, inarticulate, constantly warring rock artists. </p> <p>What makes Metallica especially amusing is that a lot of it centres on the band's sessions with a therapist who calls himself a 'performance-enhancement coach', hired by the group's management to help resolve personal and professional discords. He was paid $40,000 a month and spent more than two years with them. His name is Phil Towle, though it might well have been 'Flannel'. Had Hemingway's celebrated 'built-in bullshit detector' been put in front of this movie it would have been chattering away like a Geiger counter at Chernobyl. </p> <p>Kerry Conran's <strong> Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</strong> is a retro-SF adventure yarn of a sub- Indiana Jones sort, in which virtually everything we see, except for the actors, has been digitally created. With relish, but without much irony, it begins in 1939 Manhattan where a Zeppelin is moored atop the Empire State Building, The Wizard of Oz is playing at Radio City Music Hall, and a mad German called Totenkopf (played by a hologram version of Laurence Olivier) has embarked upon the destruction of the world, launching an attack against New York using giant iron birds and robots. </p> <p>Only Polly Perkins, ace reporter on the New York Chronicle (Gwyneth Paltrow) and her boyfriend, intrepid British aviator, Sky Captain (Jude Law), can save us. Faced with this mind-boggling threat, the pair go monde-Biggling around the globe in his amphibious fighter plane, taking in Shangri-La and other spots. The designs come from Things to Come, King Kong, the lurid artwork of pulp science-fiction magazines of the 1930s, as well as B-feature space serials. It's technically brilliant, but as far as I'm concerned the Buck Rogers stops here. </p> <p>James Wan's <strong> Saw</strong> is a horror-thriller that's like Seven seen from the point of view of the serial killer's victims. A photographer (the film's co-writer, Leigh Whannell) and a cancer surgeon (Cary Elwes) wake up to find themselves chained to the wall at either end of a grimy, white-tiled subterranean washroom. </p> <p>They've been abducted and are at the mercy of a brilliant ludic lunatic who plays painful games with them, from which only one can emerge alive. A flashback reveals that he's known to the press as 'Jigsaw', a serial killer with a warped personal agenda. The twists are astonishing, the pain palpable, and Wan almost dares us to walk out before the eponymous tool is put to use. Not for the fainthearted who, like William's girlfriend, Violet Elizabeth, will squeam and squeam until they're sick. </p> <p><strong> Layer Cake</strong> is a flashy, way-above-average British gangster movie with an excellent performance from Daniel Craig as a middle-management drug dealer. On the point of getting out, he gets in much deeper by becoming involved in the violent machinations of Serbian manufacturers of ecstasy based in Amsterdam, big-time British hoodlums with connections in Canary Wharf, and Merseyside's gangsters. It's the directorial debut of Matthew Vaughn, and much superior to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, which he produced. </p> <p><strong> Mambo Italiano</strong> is yet another raucous ethnic comedy about someone trying to break away from family restrictions, in the manner of Moonstruck and Wedding Banquet (the top end of the sub-genre) and My Big Fat Greek Wedding (the bottom end). The hero here is a young gay man from Montreal's La Petite Italie living with his policeman partner and wanting to come out of the armoire. Crude, sentimental, wildly overacted. </p> <p>Made by two Australian philosophers-turned-moviemakers, <strong> The Ister</strong> is a stimulating three-hour journey in time, space and the mind. They take us up the Danube from the Black Sea to Germany looking at life, art, politics, history and other things through the prism of a lecture given in 1942 by the Nazi-sympathising intellectual Martin Heidegger on a poem by Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin. </p> <p>Rebecca O'Brien, the producer of six Ken Loach movies, has moved into a rather different area with the Anglo-German-Italian <strong> Princesa</strong>, a film about a Brazilian transvestite working as a prostitute in Milan to pay for a sex-change operation. Directed by Henrique Goldman, a Brazilian based in London, it's an oddity, honest yet faintly exploitative. </p> <p>Unlike Neil Jordan's The Crying Game, the central character, a far from ingratiating figure, is played by a woman, the 19-year-old Ingrid de Souza. </p> <p><strong> Open Water</strong> (15) <br>Low-budget high-tension thriller in which a yuppie couple go scuba-diving and end up on the menu for a fish dinner. </p> <p><strong> Collateral</strong> (15) <br>Michael Mann helps Tom Cruise get nasty as a hit man having a hard day's night in LA. </p> <p><strong> Ae Fond Kiss</strong> (15) <br>The title is from Burns, the plot from Romeo and Juliet , the setting is Glasgow and Ken Loach is in a mellow mood. </p> <p><strong>The Motorcycle Diaries</strong> (15) <br>Idealistic 23-year-old Che Guevara travels around Latin America Easy Rider -style. </p> <p><strong> Dead Man's Shoes </strong> (18) Paddy Considine shines in his friend Shane Meadows's thriller about a revenge trip in the English Midlands.</p>",
  "Before the eighties, people from a background such as mine might have become a secretary or an air hostess and not expected anything more. I was the first person in my family to go to university, not due to my relatives' lack of intelligence, just circumstances. <p>When I got to college, I was younger than everyone else because I hadn't taken a gap year. The thought hadn't crossed my mind and my parents certainly wouldn't have supported it. They were paying for me to get a degree so I could get out to work as soon as possible to earn a decent wage. I didn't have the pleasurable options of the middle classes. I was there to get a good qualification. </p> <p>I am a much-maligned Essex Girl who has had the all-time classic jokes ('How does an Essex Girl turn on the light after sex? She opens the car door') retold in such far-flung places as Salvador, Reykjavik and Miami. It gets me every time. </p> <p>Essex hasn't always been the comedy Shangri-La. The phrase was coined by the tabloids in 1989 (more anon). So the true horror of being an Essex Girl only hit when I left home at the age of 18 to attend Kent University. The campus was inundated with home counties students whose mothers wore tweed rather than D&amp;G leggings. 'Poor thing!' exclaimed the girls on my (not very Essex) politics and economics degree course. 'Why do you Essex Girls feel the need to be so promiscuous? Are you all very insecure?' </p> <p>I was still a virgin at this point so I didn't have a clue what they were talking about. For all the jokes and ridicule, the public-school girls from Berkshire were getting a lot more action in the first term than I was. </p> <p>Not that the men on campus seemed to understand this. To them, being an Essex Girl (and a curvy, naturally blonde one at that) meant 'sure thing'. If I had wanted to become the rugby mascot, I think it would have been entirely possible. </p> <p>The academics didn't have a much higher opinion of us. 'You're from Essex? What could you possibly know about the subtlety of English literature?' a gruesome professor barked at a close friend during her first seminar. 'Your breed have destroyed our language!' </p> <p>Other friends with impeccable exam results and CVs packed with charitable good works were turned away from Oxford and Cambridge. Obviously, the admissions board didn't dare blame their place of residence, but jokes were made about it in the interviews. One professor actually told my classmate Hannah a joke (yes, it was the car door one). </p> <p>After university, I headed into the world of work ... well, to society magazine Tatler . 'Chigwell exists?' the fashionistas asked, hooting with merriment. 'We assumed it was all some ghastly fabrication of the BBC!' I quickly shut up about my roots. If you didn't live in Fulham or Notting Hill, the social butterflies got utterly confused. The concept of clubbing with people in rainbow-coloured Ralph Lauren shirts and getting a kebab afterwards would have been lost on them. </p> <p>For the women of Essex, Margaret Thatcher was a beacon of independence. No, you don't have to rely on a man for wealth and success. No, you don't have to live in a council house forever - buy it! Make it your own. My grandparents benefited from the sale of council houses and their streets suddenly became safer, prettier places. Their homes became their castles. My grandma proudly hung fancy nets and and spent a fortune on getting a new patio laid. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Britain was in full throttle. The dynamic and ambitious were rewarded. The boys from Basildon and Billericay cruised into the Stock Exchange with a manic drive that scared the aristos back to Mummy in Surrey. To celebrate their success, the boys built mock Tudor mansions in the 'golden triangle' of Chigwell, Loughton and Buckhurst Hill and paid for their wives to get blonder and blonder. </p> <p>The nouveau riche were at home in Essex. Glamour could have been the name of a Romford suburb. Footballers and Page Three girls provided the Beverly Hills excitement we craved. But as we Essex folk got richer and more outrageous, the chattering classes started to take offence. How dare a county of working-class wannabes with estuary accents ('Ya camin' dahn tahn?' - polite translation, 'Are you coming down to town?) take all their jobs and cash? </p> <p>There's one word to explain it all - meritocracy. Britain had been held hostage by the old boys' network and the insufferable aristocracy for far too long, and along with all the hideous side effects of Thatcher's reign, she did help out the Essex crowd by allowing them to buy council houses, lowering taxes and rewarding business-minded competitors. Essex man - and woman - was no longer frightened of banging on the door of the boardroom or hammering at the glass ceiling. They wanted a piece of the action and lacked the manners to wait to be invited. </p> <p>The downside to this frivolity was the media reaction. When one tabloid newspaper featured a tale about two Essex Girls who slept with all five members of the pop group New Kids on the Block, a stereotype was born. They happened to be wearing white stilettoes in the hastily taken snaps. TV's Spitting Image saw an opening and followed up with some sharply drawn caricatures, while Harry Enfield's Loadsamoney was the final straw. It was official: Essex people were brash, promiscuous and loud. But also proud. No other county is as infamous as my own, yet we've had the strength to carry on our chosen paths and not worry about what other people think. </p> <p>Many Essex jokes are so unpleasant that they would be banned if levelled at any other racial or sexual minority. Yet we smile pleasantly ... and get on with running the country. </p> <p>With the Conservative Party conference starting on Monday, it seems a good time to revisit the Essex Girl phenomenon. After all, Margaret Thatcher is an icon once again. In one of fashion's more bizarre turns, she is our pin-up of choice this winter, with the new trend for ladylike dressing. Her trademark pussycat-bow blouses, printed chiffon tea dresses, granny handbags and jewelled brooches were seen on all the catwalks and are now in the shops. </p> <p>And, in two weeks' time, the Women's Library in London opens a new exhibition, Iron Ladies: Women in Thatcher's Britain. The memorabilia includes clothing, photographs and posters of the period - and the show will look at the impact of Thatcherism on Britain's women in the 1980s, in particular the way her presence as a role- model affected the history of feminism. Was her individual achievement as a woman an aberration or did it reflect the growing power of women in the economy and the professions? Did her 'common sense', free-market capitalism (i.e. the rise of Essex Woman) empower - or damage - us? </p> <p>Speaking personally, I'm a typical example of the Essex Girl. Born in Walthamstow, my parents worked bloody hard, 'made good' and moved out a few miles to Chigwell. It seemed a prosperous, leafy garden village - until the TV series Birds of a Feather revealed the true hilarity of my tree-lined, golf-club-'n'-nail-bar hometown. The cockney birds Shaz 'n' Trace befriending 'Jewish princess' Dorien in the BBC series was too true to be funny. They resembled my best friends' mums. </p> <p>I confess that for the next few years, when travelling abroad, I told everyone I came from London. Essex? Never heard of it. </p> <p>But those cowardly days are over. Today, I relish the idea of being an Essex Girl. Rather than being an embarrassment, it's a badge of honour. My Essex girlfriends are successful, dynamic and at the top of their chosen fields, be it law, medicine or the media (I would argue that the white stiletto stereotype actually spurred us on to achieve more). </p> <p>I come from the finest female stock in the country. From the original Colchester Queen, Boudicca, through the fictional tart Moll Flanders, to today's celebrity big sellers - Jade Goody, Jessie Wallace, Jodie Marsh and Denise van Outen. Tony Parsons and Julie Burchill were once the Essex equivalent of Romeo and Juliet. </p> <p>And don't forget the serious pedigree names: Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Sade, Germaine Greer and Florence Nightingale all have an Essex postcode or connection. George Clooney is keen on my sisters as well, and keeps going back to the model Lisa Snowdon to prove it. </p> <p>Far from being 'chav scum', Essex Man is surprisingly astute and charismatic as well. Jamie Oliver, Damon Albarn, Jay Kay, Dermot O'Leary and Andrew Motion are the nation's finest. Victoria Beckham is reported to be disenchanted with her 'Essex yob' husband these days (although she now denies saying this) but the rest of the world doesn't seem to mind. Alfred Hitchcock and Winston Churchill adopted Essex as their home county when their careers flourished, Hitchcock insisting it was Essex and its people that inspired his work more than anything else. I just hope he wasn't talking about Psycho . </p> <p>So what is the truth behind the sniggering that we Essex folk have to endure? We are at all times the best and the worst. We like flash motors and fashion labels. We drink too much chardonnay and bleach our hair to straw. We'd rather join a gym than go to church and we dance on tables when we're tipsy. But we are tough and honest; we are conscientious and proud. Essex people work hard to play hard. We throw a hell of a good party. And you can't say fairer than that. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Iron Ladies is at the Women's Library, Old Castle Street, London E1, from 22 October to 2 April 2005.

  "<p>In 1972, Mindy Blake, a former captain of Wentworth golf club, published The Golf Swing of the Future (Souvenir Press), in which he lamented the failure of so many professional players to concentrate sufficiently on their technique. 'To understand golf,' he said, 'you need the kind of mind which is good at mathematics and physics. Golf is purely a matter of technique.' </p> <p>He remarked on how even the best players hit the ball in different ways from each other and how each had his own eccentricities and inconsistencies of swing. 'The study of the basic technique involved in hitting a golf ball efficiently, cleanly and accurately is still in its infancy.' Quite so. </p> <p>Blake was a prescient writer and his book is fascinating to read, because today golf has become little more than a game of technique. With the aid of video and specialist coaches, the modern player has evolved a golf swing that has a smooth, bland uniformity. They all hit the ball in the same way. The maverick with his own particular idiosyncratic swing - Eamonn Darcy, say - has largely disappeared. </p> <p>Nick Bradley has worked closely with David Leadbetter and talented professionals such as Justin Rose. He is a kind of golfing entrepreneur: coach, writer, motivational speaker, sage. This, his first book, offers the best and most imaginative guide to hitting a golf ball that I have ever read. Superbly illustrated and written in precise, epigrammatic sentences, this book offers its seven laws of the golf swing with scientific rigour. </p> <p>Having read his book, I recently spent a day with Bradley at Mill Ride golf club in Ascot. I am an enthusiastic if occasional golfer: I can hit the ball well with my woods, but have little control over my irons. When I was a boy it was quite the reverse: I could use my irons but not my woods. I have never had a lesson. I hold the club in the way that feels most comfortable to me. What could Bradley do to improve my game in that one afternoon? Could he turn me from a golfer who scrambles to make double bogeys into a respectable 18-handicapper? </p> <p>When I arrived at the club he asked me to hit some balls with a seven iron. I shanked the first three shots, the fourth skimmed along the ground while the fifth was struck well. He looked at my stiff posture and how I held and swung the club. Within five minutes, I had a new grip; within another 20, I had a new swing. We discussed 'arm alignment, the 'line of fire' and 'perfecting the upper-body pivot'. Then we played some holes. </p> <p>I parred the first, a demanding five; struck my ball straight into the water at the second; I missed a putt for a birdie on the long par-three third; and then I settled into my old routine of scrambling for double bogeys. But I had enjoyed my day with Bradley and hope, if time and patience allow, that I shall follow, if not all, then at least some of his seven steps. Whether that will lead me back to the golf swing of the future as prophesied by Mindy Blake remains to be seen. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The 7 Laws of the Golf Swing: Picturing the Perfect Swing by Nick Bradley, with a foreword by Justin Rose, is published by BBC Books at \u00a316.99</p>",
  "<p>Beverley Turner has learnt to be pragmatic. She understands, she says, that her husband's career comes before his marriage. At least for the foreseeable future. Every morning he leaves home before she's woken up. In four years they've had breakfast together fewer than 20 times. He puts in seven-day weeks; long weekend breaks spent with friends are unheard of. His job is an obsession. 'It's hard to be part of a team when your partner is part of another, stronger, bigger, more important team,' she says. 'They are selfish, focused, driven, single-minded.' They have a baby son, Croyde, but she calls herself 'a part-time single mum'. Her husband she describes as 'a parent by mobile, a text parent'. </p> <p>Two weeks later Beverley's husband stands, tanned, broad-shouldered, square-jawed, every inch the superhero, on a podium in Athens. James Cracknell - along with his team-mates, Matthew Pinsent, Ed Coode and Steve Williams - has just won an Olympic gold medal in the coxless fours rowing final. </p> <p>Before Athens, Beverley, who has her own career as a writer and broadcaster, had tried to explain how she felt about her husband's campaign to win a gold at the Olympics. God, yes, she desperately wanted him to succeed. For all those bitterly cold early morning starts in the middle of winter to have been worthwhile. Maybe, if the British team crossed the finishing line first, they would be able to pay off their mortgage. And yet she worried that victory would mean she would see less of him, not more. He had separated from his previous girlfriend after winning gold at the 2000 Sydney Games. He blamed the break-up on how much busier he was after the championships than before. Only three of Britain's 13 rowing gold-medal winners from the Sydney squad were with the same partners four years later, Turner told me. 'What happens won't make any difference to the way I feel about him. But I know that whether he wins or loses it will affect the next 25 years.' </p> <p>'Footie totty, 'tennis babes', 'brolly dollies' - these cliched images of women for whom the biggest decision of the day is a leg wax or a manicure still persist. When hyperbolic sports commentators raid their thesaurus for words such as 'sacrifice' and 'dedication', they are rarely referring to the long-suffering partner on the sidelines or the lonely children back at home. Yet the reality is that marriage and family life in sport is increasingly under intolerable pressure and the traditional image of the sporting wife who has infinitely more handbags than brains is no longer accurate. No wonder that while the national divorce rate is high - around 40 per cent - within professional sport relationships it's 70 per cent. </p> <p>The sports pages have been transformed into agony columns. Cricketer Graham Thorpe dramatically blamed his loss of form and refusal to go on several winter tours on his failing marriage. 'I am worn down and burnt out,' he said. 'Events off the field have prevented me from focusing.' His wife, Nicky, said: 'To be a real dad you have to be there to put them to bed and take them to school.' His fellow England and Surrey batsman Mark Butcher also blamed a run of poor performances on problems at home. </p> <p>In April, Scottish golfer - and hero of this year's Ryder Cup - Colin Montgomerie finally split up from his childhood sweetheart, Eimear. She said she was exhausted by Montgomerie's extreme self-absorption and unpredictable moods. In a 'quickie divorce' settlement she cited her ex's 'unreasonable behaviour' as grounds (he was so competitive his children would let him win at snakes and ladders). Montgomerie himself has talked frankly about his obsessive behaviour wrecking his marriage. In a well publicised crisis four years before they finally parted for good, he moved into a hotel and spent his days wandering around Harrods and his nights trawling London's empty streets. 'To say that I was shattered is an understatement,' he said at the time. 'I felt that everything I had achieved just fell through the floor. I cried a lot. I felt a failure.' </p> <p>Another golfer, Nick Faldo, was so self-absorbed he persuaded his (now ex-) wife Gill to have three induced births to fit in with his tour schedule. She has since said: 'In my heart I would have loved to have a had a natural birth, but at the time it was a mutual decision. I did sometimes wonder what it would take for Nick to pull out of a tournament for someone else's sake.' </p> <p>More recently, David Beckham's ill-judged penalties at Euro 2004 were blamed on turmoil at home: either his wife, Victoria Beckham, and her decision not to give up her career to uproot to Spain, or his text 'n' tell former public relations assistant, Rebecca Loos. Tour de France cyclist Lance Armstrong dedicated his autobiography to his wife - 'To Kik, for completing me as a man'. Five years, three children later they divorced and it was rock singer Sheryl Crow who cheered him on to a record-breaking sixth win in July. (To make sure that she doesn't feel left out of his career, he's thoughtfully bought her a bike.) </p> <p>George Best, Faldo, Wayne Rooney, Boris Becker, Frank Bruno, Paul Gascoigne (not to mention a certain Swedish football coach and the suits at the Football Association) - our male sports stars have started to make the British royal family look like Relate counsellors. Sportswomen, meanwhile, are far less likely to let their love lives interfere with their training routine. They either remain single and childless, choosing to settle down after their career is over, or their partners become their coaches and mentors, as with Paula Radcliffe's husband Gary Lough. If there is another man mentioned it's more likely to be a rather older one - the father. </p> <p>Cricket and golf have the worst reputations for unhappy relationships and broken families. Seasoned commentators blame long tours and endemic sexism - neither likely to be chapter headings in Ten Steps to a Good Marriage . 'In golf, women are seen as second-class citizens,' one golfing writer told me. 'From the clubhouse up. They're either Barbie dolls or Eves, destroying a man's talent.' Meanwhile, cricket's image has yet to be feminised in any way. Even Wisden recently ran a piece by ex-player Derek Pringle entitled 'Don't marry a cricketer'. </p> <p>These days, though, few sports are immune. There's more pressure, longer tours, greater fame, increased column inches - for the players and their wives. Meanwhile, none of this is conducive to putting in the washing, taking out the rubbish, dropping off the kids at school, picking them up. While leading sportsmen are finding that the business they're in makes ever greater demands on them, their partners are too. </p> <p>Karen Parlour won a landmark divorce settlement case in June against her ex-husband Ray, the long-time Arsenal midfielder who has now joined Middlesbrough. As the case unfolded, it proved to have three of the classic ingredients of a modern sporting marriage. First, a childhood romance gone sour; professional sportsmen, often from close-knit stable backgrounds, are frequently initially attracted by the idea of settling down. Second, addiction; like many professional footballers, success had come hand in hand for Ray with an alcohol and gambling problem. Karen's lawyers argued that she had been instrumental in helping him recover, in his early career, from problems with drinking and betting. Without her support he would never had thrived under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger at Arsenal. Third, the other woman; one morning Ray phoned Karen to announce that he was leaving her and their three children for a new girlfriend. </p> <p>Karen Parlour's divorce settlement included \u00a31.8million of Ray's future earnings. It was clear whose side the Sun was on - the one-word front-page headline the following day read: 'Fleeced'. Maggie Rae, Karen Parlour's solicitor at Clintons, a law firm that handles many high-profile sporting divorces from tennis to horse racing, argues Karen's side of the story. 'A sporting marriage can be overwhelming. It takes over everything. Like diplomats' wives they are subsumed by their husband's careers. Meanwhile, the real high-earning days are limited. They have all this responsibility and pressure without any of the security. A company wife would feel much more secure and at the same time wouldn't have the nail-biting pressure of a victory or a loss to deal with, on a day to day basis.' </p> <p>She continues: 'The club ethos doesn't help. The club is often more important than the marriage. The wife will have spent years feeling excluded from that club mentality. Many women have no idea what it's like to be married to a professional sportsman until it's too late. They convince themselves they'll be the ones to make it work.' </p> <p>In many respects a sporting partner in 2004 has more in common with Fifties-style Stepford Wives than Footballers' Wives. Even the clothes are a kind of uniform; it just happens to be Gucci, not gingham. Pictures of the wives and girlfriends (or Wags as the FA's acronym calls them) of the Euro 2004 England team, or of the wives and girlfriends of the 1999 US Ryder Cup team, for instance, show a classic feminine look where every woman is tanned, polished, thin. The majority don't work but, however rich they may be, neither do they employ childminders or nannies. Even Victoria Beckham stresses how much childcare she does. </p> <p>The focus of the marriage is seen to be on the husband and his career while the wife plays the role of the quiet, loyal supporter. She is not allowed to complain or to step out of line. If she does - such as Posh Spice's decision not to move to Madrid - she's criticised or ostracised (witness the glee when Mrs Beckham missed the boat on booking into the same hotel as the other Wags in Portugal because it was full). Meanwhile, in a world where most of the management, the fans and the journalists are male, she must develop a coating tougher than any Chanel nail varnish if her partner starts to underperform. Tiger Woods's girlfriend, part-time Swedish model Elin Nordegren, has been blamed for his run of bad performances. It's conveniently forgotten that he had a girlfriend when he was doing well, too. </p> <p>Steven Ortiz, an assistant professor of sociology at Oregon State University, has researched sport marriages for 10 years. He interviewed many sporting wives and partners and gradually infiltrated an often secretive inner circle. 'We know a great deal about high-profile husbands. In contrast, we know very little about the almost invisible wives. These are husband-orientated, career-dominated marriages,' he says, 'set in a hyper-masculine world. They have something of the army marriage or the corporate marriage - but more so. Wives have second-class status.' </p> <p>Ortiz, who is writing a book about sporting marriages, receives emails from women saying: 'Look, I've met this great guy but he's a professional basketball player. Do you think it's a good idea?' He avoids answering by saying he's 'an academic, not a therapist' but one suspects he would suggest they run a personal best - in the opposite direction. </p> <p>He describes a world where wives are suspicious of outsiders, where they often feel betrayed by husbands who are unfaithful, by managers who have the power to cut off the money supply, by supporters who shout insults in the street. Contrary to the stereotype of the gold-digging groupie, many women marry young, never really believing their partners will actually become famous. </p> <p>Life with a sporting partner is one of extremes, both emotionally and financially. There's the adrenaline rush of a win ... or the crashing disappointment of defeat. A player can be bought for record-breaking amounts of money one season, be dropped or injured the next. Mothers have the pressure of looking after children single-handed, followed by the change of dynamic in the household when the sportsman finally returns from a tour. As Ortiz says: 'Sporting wives are used to coping with the kind of stress other women would find unbelievable.' </p> <p>He describes husbands who have been hero-worshipped since they were boys by their parents - 'sport mothers are worse than stage mothers'. Marriages where 'the wife provides emotional support for her husband but his support for her is minimal, particularly during the season. His often self-absorbed pursuit of his career leaves her feeling neglected, unappreciated and abandoned.' </p> <p>There is, he has discovered, an unwritten set of rules which wives must abide by. One of his interviewees talks about the importance of keeping up a united front: 'Never do anything in public to reflect on his image or that of the team. I've learnt to grin and bear it. Suppress and smile. Like a politician's wife.' So much so, she explains, if her husband is injured and she's in the stands she maintains her composure. 'Be stoic. Don't show that you're worried.' </p> <p>Another wife, Martha, outlines rule number two. 'You're like a kid. Seen and not heard.' Ortiz's interviewees even describe sitting separately from their husbands on the tour bus and thinking twice before joining in the banter. Rules three and four are 'Get along with the other wives' and 'What happens on the tour, stays on the tour'. In other words, a conspiracy of silence builds up. 'Wives become the unwilling keepers of the \"clubhouse secrets\" by not revealing what they see on the road.' </p> <p>He describes a culture where sleeping around is a sign of manliness: 'Male infidelity is tolerated ... even encouraged. The team claims for itself the loyalty of the husband as a \"real man\" or \"one of us\".' The global multimillion-pound business of sport means that our sports heroes are treated more like pop singers with magazine front covers, commercials, fashion shoots, appearances on chat shows. The result is that almost every sport with the possible exception of darts has its groupies and affairs. </p> <p>Some British footballers, for example, have become better known for their antics off the pitch than on. Yet while two new verbs - 'roasting' and 'dogging' - have slunk into the language, it's not only footballers who are playing away. There's the world-class golfer who gets his PA to find an available woman at every hotel; the married cricketer with four mobile phones, one for each girlfriend; the tennis star's baby conceived in a restaurant cloakroom. Rumours abound. What's more surprising, perhaps, is that many wives know exactly what is happening but choose to keep quiet about it. </p> <p>I first met Suzi Walker mid-Nineties when she featured in a Channel 4 Cutting Edge documentary about footballers' wives. A former model, she had been married to her husband, the then Tottenham goalkeeper Ian Walker, for two years. She was everything one imagined a footballer's wife might be - blonde, blue-eyed, bosomy and as bubbly as a late-night cocktail at Stringfellows. </p> <p>Eight years on it's a different story. Over a difficult 12-month period around 1998, Ian's mother died, while Suzi had a life-threatening labour with their daughter, Sophie, and began to suffer from chronic ME. Tottenham gave Ian one week off following his daughter's birth, after which he was summoned back to work. Suzi plainly adores her husband - 'We have a strong marriage and I can 100 per cent trust him' - but there's a weariness in her voice that wasn't there when we met before. </p> <p>'We've had highs but lots of lows too. At one point it was a real struggle. Sophie wasn't sleeping, I'd barely come out of hospital. Plus Ian was getting over the death of his mum. It affected his football. He had a couple of dud games and they bumped him out of the team. I was really hurt by that. Ian had loved Spurs. So had I. But you come to realise there is no room to follow your heart. The football clubs are hard and you have to be too.' </p> <p>Ian is now at Leicester City. He stays in a hotel near the club three nights a week and travels back down to the family in-between. Meanwhile, Suzi's illness still flares up, exacerbated by stress (being married to a goalie can't help much). Plainly the Walker family are not bankrupt or homeless. Suzi talks about cutting back, but what she means is rationing the number of BMWs lined up in the driveway. On the other hand, it's clear that clubs do not see family life as a priority for their players and there is very little compassion if problems at home invade the pitch. 'No one said, \"Take a couple of weeks off to sort yourselves out\",' she recalls with some bitterness, 'which is what we desperately needed. Meanwhile fans would lash out at us when we were out. They didn't care that his mum had just died and his wife had been at death's door. I used to wake up in the morning and think this can't get any worse. Callous and mean - that's how football really is.' </p> <p>Ian is on a one-year contract with Leicester, relegated from the Premiership last season. At the end of the season, he doesn't know for whom or where he'll be playing. 'But he'll have to go where the money is. You can't put your feelings first. We've just got to get through it. You have to go where the offers are.' </p> <p>Children are treated with suspicion by coaches and managers. The received wisdom suggests that once children are on the scene a sportsman will lose his focus, his edge, his desire to win. Sport will no longer be the most important thing in his life. Earlier this year, the England cricket captain, Michael Vaughan, opted to attend the birth of his first baby, Tallulah Grace, rather than compete in a match against New Zealand. The decision - pretty much taken for granted outside sport - was greeted with surprise (traditionally, babies have been induced to fit in with all-important tour dates). The footballer Ledley King was similarly criticised when he returned home from Euro 2004 to be with his partner when she was about to give birth. </p> <p>Denise Fraser, the wife of former England cricketer Angus Fraser, is one of the few sporting wives to have spoken out about the way families are treated by their teams. She asked her husband if he would have followed Vaughan's example if he had still been playing (Angus remains on the cricket tour as a broadcaster and writer). 'Probably not,' he conceded. </p> <p>Back when he was playing, Angus counted the number of nights he had spent at home one year - it was fewer than 30 per cent. 'You are a single mum,' Denise says, echoing Beverley Turner. 'Even when the husbands are at home playing county cricket. Most of the responsibility is yours. Especially where discipline is concerned. You end up being the strict one. Meanwhile, the men either come home just wanting to have fun or are too exhausted even to pick the kids up.' </p> <p>Their son, Alexander, has complained in the past: 'Why can't dad have a normal job?' </p> <p>She has spoken out about the anti-wife attitude that she experienced in the Nineties. During one South Africa tour which the families were invited on, there weren't even enough seats on the airport bus for the wives and children. 'It was a fiasco,' she recalls. 'Once they're playing you're pretty much stranded. The girls would be left to get on with it.' </p> <p>When Angus had a difficult patch she would feel in the way. 'Any small domestic problem would escalate according to what he was going through. I remember he was dropped from one game and our son was ill at the same time. His reaction was \"I don't need you here\".' </p> <p>Does any of this matter - the long distances apart, relationships under pressure, children missing out on their fathers - if the sportsman performs on the pitch? Increasingly sport psychologists argue that there must be a balance between the professional and private. Certainly Colin Montgomerie, Graham Thorpe and Mark Butcher watched their form suffer when their personal lives collapsed. Andre Agassi, who is now married to Steffi Graf having been divorced from the actress Brooke Shields, has talked about the benefits of a good home life. 'Sex doesn't interfere with your tennis. It's staying out all night trying to find it that affects your tennis. Marriage is the best thing.' </p> <p>The markedly different private lives of the World Cup-winning England rugby team and the disappointing performance of the England football squad in Euro 2004 support the prevailing view. Sir Clive Woodward took much of the boorishness out of the rugby side. The often loutish, boozy image was replaced with players such as Jonny Wilkinson and Jason Robinson, who looked as though a dash of lime in their soda water was enough excitement for one night. </p> <p>Meanwhile, barely a week goes by without the England football team's messy private lives being exposed in the press, from Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's affair with Faria Alam to Sol Campbell's ex demanding a DNA test to prove he's the father of her baby, from Emile Heskey's affair with a lap dancer to revelations about Wayne Rooney visiting a massage parlour. </p> <p>Sports psychologist Carole Seheult works with young footballers who have recently signed up to professional teams. 'A good relationship is absolutely key,' she says. 'You can't be worrying all the time about what's going on at home. The dynamic of the personal relationship is crucial.' </p> <p>Research repeatedly shows that most men feel happier and healthier when they're married. Contrary to the popular image of the sporting playboy, it's possible that married sports men might crave that stability more than most. But, in the intense world of modern sport, stability can be elusive, certainly without an understanding coach in the background. While 'work/life balance' is the mantra for the rest of us in the workplace, sport is becoming more pressured, not less. Meanwhile, the 21st-century sporting wife is seeking a more equal relationship, too: a marriage of two halves. </p> <p>Beverly Turner and I speak again following her return from Athens. How does life look now? 'Exhausting,' she says. But it transpires that this has more to do with a week's partying after the Olympic rowing final than any early-morning starts. Now they're back home, James is spending time with the baby. 'We've even got two weddings to go to this weekend,' she says laughing. 'There was nothing I could do in the run-up to the Olympics. His life was dictated by the team and by the coach, and I had to fit around that. Now we're doing things as a couple and it's great... if a bit strange.' </p> <p>Has James decided whether to carry on rowing, to look towards Beijing in four years' time? 'He hasn't decided yet,' she says. What does she want him to do? 'To be honest I don't mind. If he goes back to rowing, at least I know what to expect. I know that life now... And anyway, I quite fancy a holiday in China.'</p> <p><strong>Faldo's female fourball</strong></p> <p><strong>The 1st: Melanie Rockall</strong> </p> <p>A tough opener.

  "<p>Flash back some 10 years. An icy recreation ground in Ipswich and an under-12 football tournament. The man who is to present the trophies, the former Ipswich, Tottenham and Manchester United striker Alan Brazil, hurries across the freezing turf, just in time to perform his duties. His straggly, thinning hair flaps in the wind, as does his worn, long white coat. His jeans are frayed and somewhat too tight. He looks, frankly, a bit of a wreck. He certainly does not look like 'Pel\u00e9', the nickname afforded him by team-mates - courtesy of his surname, he has insisted modestly, not his ability to score goals. Few of the children know who he is, or was. He is not exactly given a rapturous reception by their parents, either. Brazil has something of a reputation around Ipswich, the town he came to at the age of 15 after the club he supported, Celtic, rejected him. After retiring through injury at 27, he ran a well known local pub, The Black Adder. But things did not work out. Eventually Brazil was declared bankrupt. He hands out the plastic trophies and the medals in quick time, muttering 'all right, son' to the recipients. Then he turns and is off back across the recreation ground... </p> <p>Now flash forward to the present. The well appointed London offices of TalkSport radio near Blackfriars Bridge. Brazil is doing his job as weekday presenter from 6am to 10am. He is TalkSport's most popular and best paid presenter, reportedly pulling in more than \u00a3200,000 a year. Then there is his weekly slot as a football pundit on Anglia TV and his work for the American cable giant ESPN. Today, after the show, he has a meeting in the City. Tomorrow, he will drive to Newmarket to see his string of thoroughbred racehorses, kept there under the aegis of the Alan Brazil Racing Club, a 200-strong syndicate. Their colours are green-and-white hoops. It was in Newmarket a couple of years ago that I first got wind that something was up with the Alan Brazil story. I spotted him in the bar of the exclusive Bedford Lodge hotel. Mobile in one hand, chilled glass of lager in the other, with the BMW parked outside, he was every considerable inch the man about town. There was no doubt about it. Brazil had come back with a vengeance. But how? </p> <p>I asked Brazil's TalkSport colleague Alvin Martin, the former West Ham captain who is himself attempting to climb the lower slopes of punditry, to name me a top six of ex-footballer pundits. Setting aside Gary Lineker, whose role is rather different, he said: 'Andy Gray at Sky is top of the list. He's got everything. Second you'd have to put Hansen. Alan has been doing it a long time. Then you'd have Mark Lawrenson, Andy Townsend - he's really broken through - Ally McCoist and, if you're talking radio, you'd have to have Alan Brazil in there. He's the sort who doesn't wear you down. He doesn't become tiresome. That's always the danger. What you've always got to imagine is that you're in a pub.' Martin spoke these words in deadly earnest. He could have been discussing the top six Premiership teams. If you thought the world of punditry would be an extension of dressing-room camaraderie and japes, as it sometimes appears, you would be very wrong. Indeed, with the notable exception of Kelvin McKenzie, who runs TalkSport, not one of the pundits or producers I spoke to approached the subject with anything but great solemnity. Pundits, like players, had to be nurtured, cajoled, moulded, cut free from the strings of dressing-room loyalty until the moment when they can fly free and Hansen-like into the living-room ether. </p> <p>As Brian Barwick, controller of ITV Sport and the man who signed Hansen to the BBC, told me: 'With a pundit you are looking 10 years down the line. There is a honeymoon period when viewers recognise them from their playing days. But that ends. Then you're going to be marked purely on your performance as an analyst.' </p> <p>It is a long way from 1970, when John Bromley, who produced that year's World Cup for ITV, put together the first 'panel', comprising Malcolm Allison, Paddy Crerand, Derek Dougan, Brian Clough and Bob McNab. Each was paid \u00a3500 for the month. They were not sent to Mexico, but put up in Hendon Hall hotel and ferried to and from a studio. After a week a worried minion alerted Bromley to the size of Allison's bill. It included champagne, Cuban cigars and expensive wine. Bromley was unworried. Such had been the instant popularity of the panel that he knew his invention would repay his investment one hundredfold. He signed the bill and ordered that, for the duration of the World Cup, each member of the panel be woken with a glass of vintage champagne. </p> <p>Such carefree times are long gone. Punditry is now a fiercely competitive business. For the producers, the pundits have become prime assets. They are also aware that current star footballers earn far more than their predecessors and have no need to court a media career. For the pundits, there is the knowledge that dozens of ex-pros are queueing up to take their seats on the sofas if they slip up and that each year there will be dozens more. Not all big-name players are successes, the most notorious example being Paul Gascoigne's induction as a pundit for ITV at the 2002 World Cup. After his bleary, bewildered and nervous performances, Gascoigne has not been sighted on the sofa since. By his own admission, he ran up a \u00a39,000 drinks bill in his room in the course of three weeks, though he insisted both Townsend and McCoist had contributed to it. This time, however, there was no John Bromley to sign it off. And then there was Barry Venison, jocked off at ITV by Townsend amid unconfirmed rumours that Gabby Logan found his astonishing transformation from bouffant Newcastle lothario to bespectacled camp icon creepy. Those in the box seats watch each others' moves as closely as if they were still jostling in the penalty area. Martin is not surprised. 'That's life,' he said. 'When we were playing it was the same, so why wouldn't it be now?' </p> <p>Today there is a pandemonium around Alan Brazil's studio. Two big stories have broken at once - the start of the school siege in Beslan and the arrest of three jockeys in an alleged race-fixing scandal. Everyone knows one of the arrested is the champion jockey, Kieren Fallon, but no news organisation has named him yet. Kelvin McKenzie, spry and scrubbed in a dark suit, emerges from the lift to take personal control. Unaware of the ghastly turn the siege would take, he repeats to no one in particular: 'Which is the bigger story?' He answers the question himself: 'Fallon is bigger.' During an advert break he enters the studio and gives instructions. There follows a debate on the likelihood of race-fixing, conducted by Brazil and his sparring partner, Graham 'Beeky' Beecroft, a journalist-turned-broadcaster. The house lawyer is in constant contact with the studio. 'Just don't let anyone mention Fallon!' Brazil gets as far as 'Kier...' and a listener mentions the initials 'KF'. There is a seven-second delay and these are zapped before they can go out. Quite a lot of zapping goes on. The producer explains that while ex-footballers can be trained in broadcasting basics, legal considerations tend to escape them. The two most troublesome recent zaps were when Brazil passed judgment on an ongoing murder trial and when a hotelier, invited on to explain his decision to ban gay ramblers, said: 'I won't have buggery in my bedrooms.' </p> <p>Brazil's broadcasting style is calm and laconic, overlaid with a sporadic bullying streak towards the polite Beecroft. It used to be Mike 'Porky' Parry, another veteran journalist, sharing the mike with him, but Parry is awaiting a heart transplant and Beecroft has stepped in. It is good knockabout stuff, underpinned by necessary news values and bearing the unmistakable stamp of McKenzie, who seems to have found a m\u00e9tier again after a rather desultory time at Sky. Really it is the Sun meets BBC Five Live, but far more entertaining than either and very clever. Ratings have risen quarter on quarter, with one arbiter,GFK, putting TalkSport first among Britain's commercial stations, with a reach of 5.4 million adults. Rajar, the traditional ratings judge, has it a close third behind Classic FM and Virgin. As with the Sun , the characters of contributors are relentlessly lampooned. Brazil - famously bucolic, though he denies it - has not escaped. The TalkSport trailer for Euro 2004 announced: 'Alan Brazil is finally coming out of the pub.' </p> <p>Brazil's tenure has not all been easy. At last year's Cheltenham Festival, which he was fronting in situ, Brazil was sacked by McKenzie for failing to turn up for a show. An insider told me Alan had been on a bender and could not be contacted. Brazil had received written warnings for such absences before and McKenzie's patience had run out. However, such was the listener reaction that McKenzie had to reinstate Brazil, who, in turn, released a contrite statement saying: 'There were times after a big \"do\" when, yes, I wasn't in the right shape to go on air.' </p> <p>The show over, Brazil and Beecroft re-emerge among the production desks manned by eager young staff. Brazil's use of the adjectival f-word is so impressive that it seems incredible that he was able to suppress it on air. There, he had been a stalwart of racing's integrity, refusing to believe the charges against the jockeys could be true. Now, he is considering conspiracies. He suspects, for example, that a horse had been 'pulled' the previous week due to collusion between two jockeys, though he admits he has no evidence. He slumps down next to me on a sofa. His mobile rings. It is Geoff Huffer, his racehorse trainer. Huffer has listened to the show and thinks the charges against the jockeys are trumped up - Fallon has by now been publicly named. When Brazil gives Huffer his new conspiracy theory, Huffer rejects that too. Brazil says he's probably right. He turns the mobile off. He is in no real mood to talk. He left Ipswich at 4am to get to the studio. He was in bed last night at 8pm. </p> <p>He muses about his playing career. Twelve goals in 25 appearances for Manchester United (a fact mentioned frequently) but never guaranteed a starting place. Some statistician has said that he got 89 goals in 220 pro appearances. 'Complete bollocks,' Brazil says. 'I got more than that. At United it was down to Big Ron. It's true I wasn't the same player there. I never recaptured my Ipswich form. And Big Ron had Hughes and Whiteside as well. It wasn't that he blanked you, but you just knew you weren't part of the gang.' </p> <p>We agree to talk in Newmarket in a few days. The whole production staff are relieved that Brazil has got through the Fallon inquisition. The appointment of Huffer as trainer for the Alan Brazil Racing Club has attracted attention in the racing press. Huffer has just returned to training after a break of several years, including some jail time for duty fraud. He is in partnership with the disgraced financier Terry Ramsden, who saw his racing and boxing interests collapse in the late 1980s and was later convicted of fraud. 'Colourful' is the word most used to describe the set-up Brazil fronts. The next day he is again absent from the show, but this time he has a legitimate reason. His father is ill. In a typically McKenzian move, Beecroft is scripted to announce: 'We want to stress that Alan has not been arrested in connection with the inquiry into possible race-fixing.' </p> <p>Exit Pele, enter the 'Italian Stallion' as Tony Cascarino was known at Millwall. A childhood friend of Townsend, Cascarino is an up-and-comer in the pundit world. His sensational swansong with Marseille, where he was France's leading scorer and called 'Tony Goal', went largely unnoticed at home, where he was remembered for flopping at Celtic and Chelsea. That changed with the publication of his unexpected bestseller, Full Time, in which he brilliantly and with brutal honesty narrates his career, prodigious sex life and chronic self-doubt. The book led to a Times column and TV and radio work, including an afternoon show on TalkSport. A tall, imposing man, it is hard to believe that he began his adult life as a trainee women's hairdresser, or that he was known within the game for the amount of time he spent tinting his hair. An attempt to rib him gently about his complete lack of qualifications to play for the Republic of Ireland, which he admits in the book, does not go down well. Instead, Cascarino makes it clear that certain frivolous attitudes towards punditry, and indeed certain pundits, irritate him. 'A manager in the Premiership was talking to me recently,' he says. 'And he said, \"If I lose my job I think I'll do what you do\". That's the attitude. They think it's easy. It's not. </p> <p>'It's not true that all ex-footballers could do it. I've been in dressing rooms with players who had no knowledge of football. Unbelievable. No knowledge of the game they're in!' It is the same, he believers, with some pundits. 'Venison is terrible. Garth Crooks is awful. Awful.' He shakes his head. 'What does Crooks bring to that show [ Grandstand ]? He doesn't bring anything!' </p> <p>It was Cascarino, one suspects, who was instrumental in bringing Townsend to the station, not that he needs the work. After six months Cascarino has still not fully mastered the control panel. Townsend worked it all out on his first day. 'Andy always gets ahead of me,' sighs Cascarino. 'Whatever I do.' </p> <p>I am summoned to McKenzie's office. He sits wearing an impish grin. I ask him what the words 'Alan Brazil' bring to mind. 'A pint of Guinness,' he replies archly, before adding: 'By that I mean a very smooth form of delivery. He's done fantastically. You've got to remember this is a man who fought his way back from bankruptcy.' But you sacked him, I point out. 'He had a temporary, erm, departure. He had had a stressful Cheltenham working enormously long hours. He was leant on by hundreds of fans to drink more than he should have. It is difficult to have a radio show with no one behind the mike.' </p> <p>He does not stint on the phrase 'bloody dick'. I ask him if there are players he would not consider using as pundits. 'That bloody dick Kieron Dyer for a start,' he says, without expansion. 'And I'll tell you who really was a revolting specimen and that was Stan Collymore. He didn't even turn up. So we didn't last long with Mr Collymore. Look, it's quite simple. Our guys choose themselves. Then you put them on air with a journalist type. In sports radio two-handers work better.' </p> <p>His personal influence, he claims, is much exaggerated. 'Listen, if I had a radio station that appealed to me, all I'd be saying all day would be: bring back hanging and shoot all asylum seekers.' </p> <p>It is, however, between the two terrestrial giants that the main pundit war is fought out. Match of the Day editor Philip Burney is chiefly concerned with bringing Gordon Strachan to the frontline. 'Alan Hansen has perfected a kind of brand,' he tells me with the gravity to which one has become accustomed. 'Now Gordon needs a good run. He needs perhaps to become more relaxed, but he works very hard. We are very keen on Gordon and we've done a lot of work with him.' </p> <p>I ask Burney if he has noticed how Strachan tends to loop an arm round the back of the sofa, sometimes creating the optical illusion that he is stroking Mark Lawrenson's neck. He does not see the light side. 'No, no,' he says. 'That's good. It shows he's relaxed.' </p> <p>But over at ITV, Barwick believes that in Townsend he has a weapon that even Hansen might not withstand. Certainly, the days of ITV's ill-fated 'Tactics Truck', in which Townsend unpromisingly began by trying to run through key moments with players barely out of the showers, are now forgotten. It has been a long-term plan. 'People forget that before we saddled him with the \"Tactics Truck\", Andy was being used locally in Birmingham. We put him on there and got some hours on the clock. I always told him, you've got to tell the viewers m something they haven't spotted. He is now an outstanding analyst. He is an almost perfect example. Andy can really undress a game.' </p> <p>The Gazza debacle would not happen again, Barwick avers gravely. It is his greatest regret in pundit-management: 'We had him in a pundit's chair for the opening game of a World Cup when he'd never done it before. We gave him a mountain to climb. When he was allowed to regale viewers with his old stories he was fine. But with the hard analysis, it came too quickly. We went on a whim and dropped him straight in it.' </p> <p>There are signs, perhaps misleading, that Townsend has become aware of his new value. He ignored perhaps a dozen requests for an interview, including a plea via his old mucker Cascarino. In the end, I ambushed him after his TalkSport Sunday morning show. Dressed casually in a tracksuit, he exudes less presence than one might imagine from TV. He speaks more slowly and diffidently than his on-air machine-gun delivery. He appears quite shy. It becomes clear, however, that he is indeed the embodiment of the new-pundit work ethic. Pundits who fall by the wayside probably have only themselves to blame. 'Their biggest mistake is they tend to look on punditry as a bob on the side,' he says. 'I've seen how certain people regard TV work. I've worked hard. Even with the Tactics Truck, which never really worked. But I personally will always have a go.' </p> <p>He talks pleasantly if platitudinously about how he enjoys it, how he speaks for the fans and how Teddy Sheringham (another old mucker) will make a good pundit. When he looks at his watch I ask about his alleged complicity in the Gazza \u00a39,000 bender and he bridles. 'I know about that,' he says quickly. 'We were having a drink but I can assure you we weren't putting them on his bill. Gazza's a friend. It was an awkward time in his life. Booze was his only get-out and unfortunately it came during the World Cup. He needed people around and we did get through a few bottles of wine. But he's fit now. He's off the booze. If he wants it there's still time for Gazza to come back on TV.' </p> <p>It is crunch time. Arsenal against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League, live on ITV. Townsend is perched, rather uncomfortably it looks on the screen, in the open air, holding a microphone. He is wearing the unorthodox combination of a brick-red jacket, a black leather-style tie and a black shirt. As well as his punditry, he now has the role of 'colour commentator' beside Clive Tyldesley during matches. Apart from Big Ron no other pundit, not even Hansen, has bridged this mythical broadcasting gulf on a regular basis. I watch and listen for evidence that Townsend has indeed perfected his art, that, as Barwick said, he will undress the game in a way I could not previously imagine while at the same time meeting the Alvin Martin principle that he can be imagined talking to me down the pub. I catch: 'I think he's got good cause to be disappointed about that one.' Then: 'Gilberto initially done well there.' But to mock is too easy. Townsend is without doubt very good at what he does. </p> <p>So is Brazil, but when he agreed to meet in Newmarket I was envisaging dew on the gallops and steam rising from horses' backs. Instead, when Brazil picks me up from the station along with his daughter, Stephanie, he drives to a pub. It is 9.30am. To be fair, it is the full breakfast he is after, though he does add: 'We'll have a few pints later, eh?' He muses about his bankruptcy. 'The brewery turned nasty.' He had to sell up and move to a smaller house. 'But I told my daughter, \"We won't be here long\". How long were we there darlin'?' </p> <p>'Six years,' Stephanie says. </p> <p>This was not perhaps the answer Brazil was expecting, but he overrides it and instead, between chews, informs me: 'I'm very confident, you know.' I say I don't doubt it, but it does occur that there may be little to be gleaned about the punditry business from watching Brazil eat his breakfast. So I decline his offer of a few later pints and, before heading back to the station, leave him with the question: where would he be if none of this had happened? If he hadn't made those first mad visits to GMTV that started it all, 150-mile round trips from Ipswich for two minutes on a settee, virtually unpaid? If he hadn't hustled Radio Suffolk, then Sky for Nationwide games and finally climbed the punditry mountain that had defeated even Gazza? </p> <p>His fork poised with bacon and baked beans, Brazil considers the question with utmost seriousness. He fixes me with a meaningful stare and, perhaps forgetting his current surroundings, replies: 'To be honest, I'd still be in a pub.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jonathan Rendall is the author of Twelve Grand: the Gambler as Hero (Yellow Jersey Press) and This Bloody Mary (Faber)</p>",
  "<p>Imagine that you are cruising north along the M1 in your \u00a3170,000 Aston Martin Vanquish. You have just left the \u00a36 million home in Hampstead that you share with your wife - a beautiful model - to go to kick a ball about in the countryside with a group of fellow millionaires. You are a World Cup-winner, a European Championship-winner, you are a reigning Premiership champion, unbeaten throughout an entire season, and you are holder of both the Professional Footballers' Association and the Football Writers' player of the year awards (as you were the previous year, too). Oh, and you were last season's top scorer. On your journey, you pass a distractingly large billboard that features a 30-foot high poster of a man clasping the Premiership trophy in triumph. That man is you. </p> <p>Welcome to the perfect world of Thierry Henry, a footballer whom, if he didn't exist, not even a comic-book editor would dare to invent. If watching Henry play football is often an exercise in disbelief, then his good fortune off the pitch is no less a challenge to credibility. Lean, handsome, charismatic and inordinately gifted, he draws adoration from a fan base that is restricted to neither men nor sports fans. He is one of those rare individuals whose wealth and success no one begrudges. Indeed, his life appears so closely to resemble a capitalist fantasy that a Renault car commercial made a capitalist fantasy out of his life. </p> <p>All of which means that if you were Thierry Henry, you might think you would be as happy as the day is long. Well, perhaps he is, but not on this sleepy late summer's afternoon. The previous evening, Arsenal had broken Nottingham Forest's record for matches unbeaten in league football, securing maximum points from their first three games into the bargain. But Henry looks a long way from content. There is, when he sits down to talk to me in an empty studio next to Arsenal's London Colney training ground, no hint of that boyish half-smile with which he can charm referees and car buyers. No sparkle or zest. No va-va-voom. </p> <p>He carries himself with the combination of loose-limbed ease and muscular pride that is the mark of athletes at their peak. Il est bien dans sa peau, as the French say, but he doesn't make you feel too bien in yours. He talks in the style common to French footballers, that of the reluctant oracle: a medley of platitudes delivered in the tone of a bored philosopher rehashing timeless truths. He begins almost every answer with the chastening phrase, 'As I've said before...' </p> <p>It would be reasonable to assume, therefore, that my questioning is at fault. But afterwards I am told, apparently without irony, by the publicist for whom Henry is promoting Nike's new Vis Total 90 Aerow ball, which is to be used in the Premiership, that he has never seen him so animated in an interview. </p> <p>Sportsmen are not paid to give interviews. Except when they are, like Henry (who is contracted to The Sun), paid to give interviews. His real job, the only one that matters, is to score and make goals, and no one on the planet currently does it better. And this is all I want to learn from Henry: how did he get to be so good? How did he improve by so much? </p> <p>With very few exceptions, strikers tend to announce themselves with a youthful flourish, before fear and wised-up opponents get the better of them. They then either settle on to a plateau of sustainable performance or become, with the help of injuries, ghosts of their former selves. In England, Michael Owen would represent the first group and Robbie Fowler the second. But seldom do forwards, once they have reached their mid-twenties, get better and better. </p> <p>When Henry arrived in England from Juventus in the summer of 1999 as a replacement for his friend Nicolas Anelka, few people, other than Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, envisaged the footballer he would become. His brief spell in Italy, where he was used as a wide midfielder, had left him short of confidence and his early performances for Arsenal earned him the title of the French Perry Groves. </p> <p>Henry said when he arrived that he needed to 'rediscover the scoring instinct, that automatic reaction in front of goal'. After four difficult months in England he conceded: 'I've literally had to go back to school and be re-taught everything about the art of striking.' Five years later he is, as the former Arsenal and England striker Alan Smith puts it, 'incomparable'. </p> <p>Henry has been a professional for 10 years, having made his debut for Wenger's Monaco side in the mid-Nineties, and now, at 27, he is in his prime. It's important to remember that as long ago as 1998, while effectively a winger, he was France's top scorer in the World Cup and joint top scorer in Monaco's Champions League campaign. He's not, like Ruud van Nistelrooy, a late starter. Yet his all-round game, to say nothing of his goalscoring, has seen an exponential improvement since 1999. It is perhaps no coincidence that this period has been spent under the tutelage of Wenger, who first took hold of Henry as a gangly 16-year-old from a Paris overspill estate. </p> <p>When I ask Henry about his extraordinary improvement he shrugs dismissively, as if irritated, then says: 'So many people say that obviously my game has changed since I arrived here and I say that it's good that it changed, otherwise it would show a lack of intelligence. You learn from your mistakes. When I was younger I was trying to do what I wanted to do, not what the game wanted me to do. I would say that's the difference.' </p> <p>There can be no doubt that Henry, for all his moody looks and arrogant swagger, is a consummate team player. You have only to look at his record of assists and willingness to pass to players in better positions to see that. While he scored 30 goals in the Premiership last season, he was directly responsible for at least 20 more and he often lays on goals that require no more than a brush from a team-mate's toe to finish. </p> <p>Recently, the ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley said that he could not recall anyone playing with such composure at such speed. The nephew of a former French 400 metres champion, Henry has a sprinter's acceleration. But unlike most footballers with pace, he runs with the ball close to him and often with his head up. In the first few games of the season, he destroyed Middlesbrough and Norwich, launching the kind of attacks that make defenders look like cones in a practice session. He was also carrying an Achilles injury. 'At the moment, I'm not doing what I can do on the pitch,' he told me. 'I can't make the runs. I'm not match fit. I'm just concentrating on my passing and being available for the team.' Whether fit or unfit, Henry has established his physical superiority in such a consistent manner as to gain him a distinct psychological advantage. In this sense, he is able to beat his man even before he goes past him. I wondered how much his sense of what he was capable of doing had grown over the years, if he was aware that he intimidated opponents. </p> <p>'Well,' he replies, 'Youri Djorkaeff used to say when we played at Monaco that he could sense that I might be a great player, but that he didn't feel that when I had the ball it was my ball. But, at the moment, when I step on the pitch, when I have the ball I know it's mine. It's just a feeling. Some players you know when they have the ball that something is going to happen.' </p> <p>He started to feel this way around four years ago, when Arsenal reached the final of the Uefa Cup and France won Euro 2000. But most observers would say that the great leap forward came in the 2002-03 season and was followed by another last term. Earlier this year, he said: 'Now I know that whenever I feel that the time has come for me to make a difference in our games, I can and I will.' </p> <p>'I saw him play against Liverpool about three seasons ago,' says Smith. 'He terrorised them. Afterwards, I spoke to a number of pros and they all said they hadn't seen anything like it. On his day, he had become unplayable, and more and more since then it has been his day. I have to say I haven't seen a player like him. He's an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best.' </p> <p>One of the striking aspects of Arsenal's slick passing football is that the team does not contain a playmaker or midfield maestro. There is, for instance, no Zinedine Zidane. Why slow the ball down in the centre of the park when you have Henry to unleash up front? No team has ever gone from box to box with the speed and precision of Arsenal. That's why they are often at their most dangerous when defending a corner. </p> <p>That all their operations in recent years have been conducted through Zidane might explain why the France side has yet to see the very best of Henry. There were rumours in Portugal of disagreements in the dressing room between the Arsenal players and those grouped around Zidane. That Henry has said he thought of retiring himself after the tournament may suggest it was not an entirely pleasing experience. 'Well, as I said to everyone,' he tells me when I ask about his disappointment in Portugal, 'and everyone thought I was mad at the time, when we played against all the teams at the Euro, they were all sitting at the back waiting for us. The Greeks did the same thing to us as they did to the Czechs and Portugal, winning 1-0. Fair enough to Greece, but I was just saying if you play against a team that don't allow you to play football, I'm not complaining, I'm just saying sometimes it's not easy.' </p> <p>Yet Arsenal have not had too much trouble breaking down sides that defend deep. Henry refuses this bait. Instead, he makes the bizarre suggestion that it is more important for teams to attempt to win in the Premiership than it is in international competitions. And therefore the opposition open up against Arsenal in a way they don't against France. Whatever the explanation, there was a suspicion that Henry was playing in Zidane's shadow for France, while in England opponents were left looking at Henry's shadow. In the event, it was Zidane, voted World Footballer of the Year in 2003, who retired in the summer from international football, not Henry, who came second in the same Fifa poll. The king is dead, long live the king. </p> <p>Les Ulis, the suburb in Paris in which Henry grew up, is often described as a tough environment, full of the kind of social problems that can make or break a young man, what's known in France as les quartiers difficiles. To be sure, it's nothing like the postcard Paris of grand avenues and elegant cafes, but nor is it anywhere near as bleak as its English equivalents. A dormitory town just to the south of the capital, not far from Orly airport, it is made up of social housing built in the Sixties that, by comparison with the average English new town, looks almost resplendent. Most impressive of all is the sports arena, containing two excellent football pitches (one junior size) and a running track. How many British towns with a population of under 30,000 have these kinds of facilities? It was here that the 11-year-old Thierry Henry played for his first team, Les Ulis. His coach was a vaguely Hercule Poirot-looking character named Claude Chezelle. </p> <p>I meet Chezelle outside the breeze block apartments in which Henry used to live. He says that even at the age of eight, Henry stood out with his vitesse. Henry had an older brother, Willy, now a metro driver in Paris, who played football for a separate team for blacks and Arabs. Born into a more enlightened generation, Henry also had the benefit of a very determined father. </p> <p>Antoine Henry, who came from Guadeloupe in the Caribbean, told Chezelle that his son would play for France. 'It is hard for kids to concentrate and Thierry was no different,' Antoine admitted. 'Perhaps I was a bit suffocating for him, but I felt I had to keep on top of him. I was so determined he should get the best chance I lost a job over it. I missed the start of a shift as a security guard after driving Thierry to a game and was fired when I turned up two hours late.' </p> <p>Chezelle remembers how Antoine would 'come to every game to watch his son. Thierry had the talent, but it was his father who had the ambition.' Henry has echoed this point himself: 'To say that my dad pushed me is an understatement. I was never naturally drawn to football.' There were a number of young Africans in the junior leagues around Paris and, because some of them did not have birth certificates, clubs would sometimes put them in younger teams. 'Thierry used to play against giants who would try to rough him up,' his father recalled a few years ago. 'It was just this kind of situation that proved to me one day that Thierry had the balls, as we say, to reach the top.' </p> <p>On one occasion when Henry was injured playing for a nearby team called US Palaiseau, his father rushed on to the pitch to remonstrate with a referee. A fist-fight ensued and the match was abandoned. Such was the tension between Palaiseau and Antoine that Henry left to join another club, Viry-Chatillon. Unusually, the Palaiseau coach, Jean-Marie Panza, left to go with him. Henry has never forgotten that loyalty and not long ago named Panza as his mentor in L'Equipe magazine. </p> <p>Chezelle shows me a photograph taken around 1986, when Henry was nine. He has a mini-afro and the familiar ironic-angelic expression that Chezelle says he inherited from his mother, Maryse, a native of Martinique. 'He also had the same way of side-footing the ball into the net that he has now,' says Chezelle. 'When I watch him on TV it's just like seeing the grown-up version of the boy.' </p> <p>According to Antoine Henry, Thierry picked up his precision shooting from watching Marco van Basten, who was his hero. It was while playing for Viry-Chatillon that the 13-year-old Henry was spotted by a scout for Monaco called Arnold Catalano. He saw the teenager score all six goals in a 6-0 victory and did not bother with the normal procedure of setting up a trial. He pretty much signed him up on the spot. </p> <p>'Thierry has never been the prototype of the player who sticks in the box to score goals,' said Catalano a while back. 'He is so hard to block because he participates in the game before finding himself the space to score. The ball is alive when Arsenal are playing and you can see Thierry takes a lot of pleasure from the technique and movement of the players around him.' </p> <p>The pace and composure in front of goal were always there but, as Catalano had it, 'he wasn't one for trying too hard if he couldn't see the point'. It was Wenger who was responsible for instilling what Catalano called 'professional grit'. </p> <p>Before making his debut with Monaco as a 17-year-old, Henry completed a course at Clairefontaine, France's renowned national football school. Claude Desseau, the director of the Institute National de Football, recalled that Henry had problems getting on the course because of poor school results. 'We really had to convince the college principal to take him because he was such a super player. He finally agreed to make a rare exception for Thierry. And, happily, Thierry got more serious about that side of things and went on to do very well with his education.' </p> <p>Also at Clairefontaine, a year below Henry, was Anelka, Henry's predecessor at Highbury. Though Desseau thought Henry an exceptional prospect, he considered Anelka to have the edge on talent - as indeed, apparently, did Anelka himself. Anelka and Henry have remained friends, but you could hardly say that they were now rivals. Henry is set on doing something that only the most dedicated athletes are capable of. In contrast to Anelka, he is fulfilling his potential. </p> <p>'I'm obsessed by the idea of making my mark on history,' he said last year. 'And Arsenal is my paradise.' His sense of history may have been shaped by watching it made at frustratingly close quarters. Though he was France's top scorer in the 1998 World Cup, he did not play in the final itself. He was due to come on five minutes after half-time, but Marcel Desailly was sent off, so he got no closer than the bench. </p> <p>His fidelity to his club - he remains unmoved by the approaches made by Real Madrid and Chelsea, who were said to have offered \u00a340million - may stem, in part, from the lessons he learnt as a restless youth. He said he was dazzled by the lifestyle he encountered on the C\u00f4te d'Azur. 'Big boats everywhere, big cars, beautiful women, the sun, the sea, the famous people. Life could seem easy in a place like this and, even as a kid, I thought, \"This might not be the best place to learn football\".' </p> <p>While still under contract to Monaco in 1996 and still a teenager, Henry was persuaded by his agents to sign an agreement with Real Madrid. However, Fifa insisted that he stay with the French club and later fined him \u00a340,000. Two years later he moved to Juventus and, like his Arsenal team-mates Patrick Vieira and Dennis Bergkamp, found himself strangled by Italian defensive discipline. Legend has it that Wenger was on the same plane as Henry one evening in 1999, flying back to France after a game in Italy. 'Thierry,' he is supposed to have said, 'you are wasting your time on the wing. You are a number nine.' </p> <p>In turn, Henry asked his old boss to rescue his stalled career. He had been relegated to the France under-21 side and questions were being asked about his mental strength. It is unlikely that Wenger's travel arrangements that night were purely coincidental. </p> <p>It was in fact Wenger, whom Henry has referred to as his 'spiritual father', who originally put him on the wing at Monaco as a temporary measure because the Brazilian striker Sonny Anderson was leading the line. And it was Wenger who brought him back into the centre, if you can really say that Henry plays in the centre. Though he has developed a good deal of physical, as well as mental, strength at Arsenal and is more than capable of holding the ball up, he is by no means a target man. 'He has intelligence and ambition,' Wenger has said. 'When you put those two things together, you have a player who wants to improve. He will get better because he wants to get better.' </p> <p>You can see the intelligence in the awareness he shows of the space around him. Perhaps it was this talent that led him to forsake the mock-Tudor attractions of Hertfordshire, the traditional home of north London footballers, for the more cosmopolitan environs of Hampstead, where he lives with his wife, Claire, better known as the model Nicole Merry. 'Yeah,' he laughs, the one moment of amusement he allows himself. 'I was close to [moving to Hertfordshire] but luckily a friend saved me from it. It happened that I was going to live not far from there and it didn't go through with the house, lucky for me. Then a friend of mine said that the place to live was Hampstead. It would have been a nightmare driving into London all the time.' </p> <p>I mention that his team-mates and countrymen Vieira and Robert Pires live nearby in the cafe-filled hill-village that is Hampstead. 'Yeah, they do,' he says dryly, 'but I see them often during the day. That's enough.' </p> <p>Viera, of course, was on the point of leaving Highbury for Real Madrid at the start of this season. Surely that would have provoked a visit to his house to talk him out of the move? 'Well to be honest,' he says, returning to the script, 'it was a decision between him and the club. We had to concentrate on the beginning of the season, which was tricky because you don't know if you're going to lose your skipper. But he made the right decision. I'm sure he doesn't regret that now that he can see the way that we can play. Obviously, if he had left it would have been a massive disappointment but I think the team spirit helped him make the right choice.' </p> <p>That Arsenal have retained their celebrated team spirit is a surprise when you consider that it is a multinational squad with seldom more than two Englishmen in the team. The club of Adams, Dixon, Keown and Parlour, the team imbued with the will to win, or more often not to lose, is no longer. 'Obviously it did change when they left,' says Henry of his former English team-mates. 'They are proper characters and great winners, but in another way they showed us the way to build... I'm sure it wasn't easy for the fans. Obviously we do not have a lot of English players any more, but, in the end, we're all wearing the Arsenal shirt. I may be French, but I'm playing for Arsenal.' </p> <p>We talk a bit about the season ahead. He concedes that United and Chelsea are the main rivals, but thinks Liverpool look good. Then, in a moment of neighbourly generosity that may surprise some of the more entrenched sections of north London, he says: 'Why not Spurs?' </p> <p>United and Chelsea were the only English teams to beat proper Arsenal sides last year in, respectively, the FA Cup semi-final and the Champions League quarter-final. The defeats still irk Henry and he is at pains to point out that Arsenal had to play Newcastle, United, Chelsea and Liverpool in the space of eight days. Of the United game, he says: 'They beat us, fair enough, nothing to say about it, but I don't know if you remember the game, we had all the chances. They had one and they took it.' </p> <p>With Chelsea he is a little more forthcoming in his praise. 'I think Chelsea played a magnificent game [in the 2-1 win at Highbury]. We had a couple of chances, then in the second half they played better than us.' </p> <p>I ask Henry if he ever watches himself and he says: 'No,' but he pauses and decides to admit the exception. 'The only game I watched was Inter Milan away, because it was special. I don't know, it was just a strange feeling. We had to win there and at the time we were not even thinking about the goal difference. And we won 5-1.' </p> <p>Henry scored two that night and contributed as close to a perfect performance as is possible outside of REM sleep. It must have been particularly gratifying to have done so in Italy, where he had been deemed a failure, in the impatient Italian style, in less than a season. They know differently now. </p> <p>His brother Willy said a couple of months ago that Henry has remained grounded, despite his superstar status and extreme wealth, and still visits him at home near Les Ulis. 'He sleeps in the same room with me at the house or on the settee without any bother. We talk about anything and everything, but never football.' </p> <p>It's a shame, then, that Henry seems so eager, when we meet, to put on a cool front, because he's cooler than that. For there is nothing as impressive as a man who takes his craft seriously and masters it, except one who manages into the bargain not to take himself too seriously. </p> <p>When Henry started at Arsenal he said that it was his duty to adapt to life in this country. He learnt English almost as quickly as he runs and he learnt how to take the knocks and get up again. He learnt to appreciate the passion of the supporters, and the importance of team spirit. But we learned something, too. We discovered what it was like to see the very best each week. </p> <p>This year if Arsenal can win the Champions League, or at least make it to the final, and if Henry can maintain the sort of form that he's shown in the past couple of years, it is a near certainty that he will become Fifa's world footballer of the year. It would be no more than he deserves. Because right now this is Henry's world.

  "<p>Three years ago, a series of cheeky posters at Newcastle started with the Leicester match. 'Tigers?' it asked, above the picture of a kitten. In fact, that game was drawn, and all since at Kingston Park have been desperately close. Except yesterday, when Leicester truly were Tigers, and Newcastle cubs. </p> <p>Leicester, their six tries earning a bonus point for the fourth consecutive game, thus go top with a win that will certainly shorten their title odds. There can have been few Premiership performances so dominant, by a team playing away against highly placed rivals, and that impression was amply underlined by the two coaches. </p> <p>Newcastle's Rob Andrew, often in downbeat and quibbling mood, kept saying: 'I take my hat off to them. Leicester's performance was as good as I've seen at club level,- alongside Wasps at the end of last season.' There would, he added, be 'a few spoonfuls of medicine taken tonight'. </p> <p>Leicester's John Wells was not inclined to demur, either, for he also rated the performance 'as good as I've seen'. The Tigers were dominant at scrummage, dynamic at the breakdown, and they all looked superior ball-players. </p> <p>It required only two minutes for the Tigers' control and aggression up front, plus an adroit kick to the corner by the young fly-half Ross Broadfoot, for Leicester to go 7-0 up. Newcastle, who had not seen the ball in that time, suffered further when Broadfoot's opposite number, Jonny Wilkinson, missed an unmissable penalty. In all, he kicked just two out of five. </p> <p>He did, though, produce a bit of magic with a backhanded flick that allowed Michael Stephenson to escape to the posts. That was a rare moment of brilliance, however, on a day when he was destined to remain a member of a shackled backline. </p> <p>Newcastle's other try was created simply, with long, swift passes, by the 18-year-old winger Matthew Tait. But by then Leicester were scoring at will, hungrily finishing off positions created by the clinical aggression of their forwards. By the end it was the Tigers who had the Falcons in a cage, and were rattling it with glee. </p> <p> <strong> NEWCASTLE:</strong> Walder (Tait 65); May, Noon, Taione, Stephenson; Wilkinson (co-capt), Charlton (Grindal 55); Peel (co-capt, Ward 40), Long, Hurter (Isaacson 76), Gross, McCarthy (Grimes 55), Charvis, Williamson, Sititi (Parling 80). </p> <p><strong> LEICESTER:</strong> </p> <p>Vesty; Murphy, Rabeni (A Tuilagi 78), Smith, Holtby, Broadfoot (Cornwell 40), Ellis; Rowntree (Morris 70), Chuter, White, Johnson (capt, Kay 55), L Deacon (W Johnson 80), B Deacon, Back, Corry. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> R Baybank.</p>",
  "<p>It wasn't the most pulsating derby that has ever been waged, but it was meaty enough. For the record, Gloucester's unbeaten record ended rather tamely and Bath stepped out of the average into the encouraging. </p> <p>Of perhaps greater note was the individual performance of Olly Barkley at outside half for the home team. It is fair to say that, whether playing 10 or 12, he did not set New Zealand and Australia alight last summer as an England tourist. </p> <p>But just as a certain Jonny Wilkinson drew only strength from his first taste of international rugby - losing 76-0 in Brisbane - so Barkley seems to have grown. He was run over Down Under, but has reinflated himself. </p> <p>He kicked well, he tackled vigorously and he generally gave fellow England tourists Michael Lipman and Mike Tindall something to run on to. The one was coming from his inside, from wing-forward, and the other was outside him, in the centre. It made for a neat triangle of forces. Barkley directed, Lipman harried and Tindall ran in for a brace of converted tries. </p> <p>These may be early days, when nothing too momentous is shifting on the plates of the season, but these two went at each other with the cheery venom of time immemorial. If these yeomen of the West Country were engaged in a horseshoe mak ing contest they would go at each other hammer and tongs. Mind you, if they were making a horseshoe there would be hammer and tongs. </p> <p>Anyway, before you could say 'engage' at the scrum, there was a dust-up between the front rows, which was nearly as predictable as the venerable Jonathan Humphreys calling a time-out for a contact-lens replacement. For decades he put in his tackles and his lenses at the Arms Park for Cardiff and Wales; now he is doing both for Bath. </p> <p>Just one more thing on antics at the set piece. When scrums go down now, wing-forwards stand up - if you see what I mean - and gesticulate expertly on points of law to the referees. 'What about the pulling?' says one. 'What about the turning in?' says the other. Such expertise, like footballers claiming a throw-in, and based on anything bar knowledge. </p> <p>The irritability of the front-rows was a variation on the lust for contact all over. The new pattern of players rushing up to tackle was soon apparent. If there is a way to avoid having your sternum entwined around your spine, it seems to be by ducking. I have noticed it lately. Little players duck and then dart. Martyn Wood managed it twice here. </p> <p>James Simpson-Daniel is one who glides out of danger, but when Robbie Fleck left an elbow hanging out for him, he might have felt the benefit of the slightly less elegant instinct to lower yourself. Fleck went off to the bin, the first of three - Olivier Azam and Rob Fidler being the other two to follow later after they were shown the yellow card. Nothing serious; it is all part of the show in these parts. </p> <p>All the up-rushing tackling left the game bruised and evenly poised until the half-hour. Then Barkley short-circuited the tacklers by blasting the ball by foot up in the air. Jon Goodridge missed the catch under pressure from Tindall. Duncan McRae then missed the bobble under pressure from Tindall. And Tindall finished off all that pressure-cooking by scoring. </p> <p>Ten points adrift at half time, Gloucester managed to claw back three thanks to a cool drop goal by McRae. But their forwards were generally out of sorts, ill at ease at the scrum and disjointed at the line-out. </p> <p>Before too long, they were falling out of contention as Barkley stroked over two more penalties. And almost completely out of the picture when Tindall ran on to a flat pass from the combative Wood, to cut clean through. That should have been comprehensively that. </p> <p>But Bath slackened off, a trait that will have irritated their Australian duo at the coaching helm, John Connolly and Michael Foley. When the season brews up, they will not want to see their well-drilled charges suddenly growing sloppy at the breakdown, careless at the first spot of driving rain. </p> <p>Still, these are not the days of heady brew yet. Bath trailed off and Gloucester managed a try. McRae stabbed a kick through and Goodridge raced behind the defence - it is the weak spot of the up-rushing line - to score. </p> <p>There were another couple of scares for the home side as the visitors belatedly rediscovered their ability to win and hang on to the ball. It was all a bit late. Even with Fidler - Gloucester old boy, but now in blue - in the bin, Bath held on. </p> <p>It may not mean much, but if you are in the business of winning the contest to see who makes the better horse-shoe, you may as well throw it to see who will have the better luck this season. </p> <p> <strong> BATH</strong> : Best; Higgins, Fleck, Tindall, Daniel; Barkley, Wood (Walshe 72); Barnes (Stevens 34), Humphreys (capt; Hawkins 67), Bell (Barnes 69), Borthwick, Grewcock (Fidler 69), Beattie (Delve 79), Lipman, Fea'unati. </p> <p><strong> GLOUCESTER </strong> : Goodridge; Garvey, Fanolua, Paul, Simpson-Daniel; McRae, Gomarsall; Sigley (Bezuidenhout 45), Fortey (Azam 45), Powell, Eustace (Forrester 62), Brown, Buxton, Boer (capt), Balding. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> D Pearson.</p>",
  "<p>The Clive Brittain-trained Warrsan is a stand-out bet at around 9-1 for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe today. A proven Group One performer who is unaffected by the ground, the tactics, or the size of the field, Warrsan has been transformed from an insecure youngster into a mature, robust six-year-old who wants to win. </p> <p>Warrsan is a funny old horse, but then Brittain is a funny old trainer. They bring out the best in each other. When Warrsan arrived at Brittain's stables in Newmarket, he had been trained with well over 100 other two-year-olds at Evry racecourse in France and had, to put it in human terms, lost his identity. </p> <p>The horse needed special treatment to bring out his rather special talent. A regular supply of Polo mints and a great deal of affection helped him on his way. 'He has a mind of his own but he's a horse who wants to do it for you,' explains Brittain. 'And if you ask him, he will. If you bully him, he won't. I haven't spent 54 years doing this job without realising that you don't win by taking, you win by giving.' </p> <p>Warrsan is closely related to former Brittain inmates Needle Gun and Luso, the latter running in the Arc without troubling the judge. The trainer came closest in 1992 with User Friendly, the remarkably tough Oaks and St Leger winner who was beaten by only a neck by Subotica. Brittain, 70, does not look back in envy; he does not look back at all. 'I am a tomorrow man, not a yesterday man,' he states with an energy that belies his years. </p> <p>'I laugh and I dance when I win, but you'll never see me cry if I lose. That's why I've lasted so long.' Brittain - or 'call me Clive', as he has been dubbed for his friendly manner - is renowned for his early starts in Newmarket. When still a university student, I rode out for him one morning. I had to be in the yard at 4am, an hour at which I was normally only just going to bed. Clive was so cheery that it could not fail to be an enjoyable experience. </p> <p>He has always provided big-race winners at long prices because he is never afraid to pitch a horse into high-class company. 'Every horse I run in Group One, whether it's 100-1, 10-1 or favourite, has a chance. I prepare the horse and, once it's saddled, the jockey is the important person. I've done everything I can and then it's over to him. There's no point worrying, because if it happens, it happens.' </p> <p>As in any top-class race, there are plenty of dangers and I particularly like the Oaks winner Ouija Board.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Where I Was From: A Memoir</strong> </p> <p>Joan Didion<br>Harper Perennial \u00a37.99, pp226 </p> <p>The memoir proffered by revered writer Joan Didion is not so much of herself as of her home state of California. Starting with her great-great-great-great-great-grandmother (born in 1766), Didion traces her ancestry as people migrate west to the 'golden paradise', risking death from disease and other hazards, such as being eaten by the rest of your family. 'The very decision to set forth on the journey had been a kind of death, involving the total abandonment of all previous life,' she points out, demonstrating the influence of such rootlessness and isolation on the psychological composition of California to this day. There is the state's slapdash committal of all and sundry to asylums, mass sterilisation of psychiatric inmates, the new town touted as nirvana 40 years ago and now a sewer of crime, unemployment and hopelessness. This is an excellent and disquieting piece of social history and sage political comment. </p> <p><strong> The Meaning Of Everything: The Story Of The Oxford English Dictionary </strong><br>Simon Winchester<br> OUP \u00a37.99, pp260 </p> <p>Following the success of The Surgeon of Crowthorne, Simon Winchester's account of Broadmoor-incarcerated WC Minor who contributed prolifically to the first edition of The Oxford English Dictionary, an OUP editor suggested to him that having written a footnote to history, why not write history itself? </p> <p>The Meaning of Everything initially suggests that the reason why not is that Winchester is philologically underqualified for the task: the history leading up to the compilation of the OED is full of fallacious linguistics, extraneous waffle and foolish suggestions, such as the reason for there having been no dictionaries before the 17th century was because nobody could be bothered. However, Winchester hits his stride once he starts upon the 67-year evolution of the first edition of the OED, which finally appeared in 1928 after numerous arguments over format and content, changes of editor, and almost driving Tolkien mad over the etymological obscurity of 'walrus'. A lively and largely informative chronicle of a still-staggering enterprise. </p> <p> <strong> Charles Bukowski: Selected Letters Volume 1 - 1958-1965 </strong><br>Edited by Seamus Cooney <br> Virgin Books \u00a310.99, pp214 </p> <p> 'I think the letter is an important form,' states Beat writer, poet and notorious boozer Charles Bukowski. 'It lets you out of the straitjacket of pure art and you've got to get out once in a while.' </p> <p>The first of four planned volumes of letters shows Bukowski in his forties, in and out of prison, discontented in his menial post office job, railing against the success of his contemporary poets, seeing his friends disappear or die around him, feeling that he is somehow missing the boat. 'I have always been one of those people who do everything wrong,' he muses. 'This is essentially because I am not involved in the march.' </p> <p>Considerately edited by Seamus Cooney, at their worst the letters are slightly tedious introvert rambling and ranting; fortunately, you are never far from an extraordinary turn of phrase, a clear-eyed observation or a merciful flush of wit: 'Since they told me another drink would kill me, I now hold it down to two gallons of beer a day.' </p> <p><strong> Cosa Nostra: A History Of The Sicilian Mafia</strong> <br>John Dickie<br>Coronet \u00a38.99 pp483 </p> <p> John Dickie's excellent, dense account of the notori ous Cosa Nostra sets out to correct popular conceptions of the organisation being glamorous, ancient or merely the mainstay of Al Pacino's career. </p> <p>The organisation is surprisingly youthful, developing barely 150 years ago through clashes over control over Palermo's lucrative citrus groves, which were determined by bloodshed, intimidation and cunningly ruining the lives of the uncomplicit owners. </p> <p>This evolved into 'an association which regards itself as above good and evil', the disturbingly primitive rationality of its 'men of honour' worryingly accommodated by Italian governments and propagated by surprisingly Anglo-Saxon notions of fellowship, absolute loyalty to their 'capo' and the loss of honour. </p> <p>Dickie punctures the mystique with plain exposition: 'The Mafia of Sicily pursues money and power by cultivating the art of killing people and getting away with it, and by organising itself in a unique way that combines the attributes of a shallow state, an illegal business and a sworn secret society such as the Freemasons.'</p>",

  "<p>Nigel Scott of Cumbria started reading Money Observer, when it first appeared. He was still in his twenties and concerned about getting on the housing ladder quickly as prices had doubled between 1971 and 1973. He says: 'I clearly remember the power building societies held at that time. They wanted you to have been a member for at least a year and have at least \u00a3100 in an account. So I was quickly into the procedure I used many years later for carpetbagging, of opening three or four accounts and moving my very hard-earned \u00a3100 around just before requesting a mortgage. This was still the era of \"don't borrow, save up and buy when you can afford it\".' </p> <p>However, he then realised that inflation made borrowing a sensible option, as the debt stayed constant as salaries and assets grew apace. 'By the mid-1980s we had a large house with a large mortgage, but our initial equity in housing had risen from around \u00a32,000 to nearly \u00a3100,000.' When life assurance tax relief and mortgage tax relief were still available, he thought endowments seemed a tax-efficient way to save. Using Money Observer comparisons and charts he opted for Standard Life and Equitable Life. </p> <p>'Although I started to follow some of the Money Observer share tips I had mixed success. I soon came to realise that I did not have the time to monitor the shares adequately so I again used advice to start saving monthly in a generalist fund. </p> <p>'Editor John Davis regularly recommended investment trusts, so \u00a350 a month went into Foreign &amp; Colonial. </p> <p>'In the privatisation era I started cautiously with BT but was soon buying shares for my wife and children. The aim was to buy four or five times more than I needed and sell the extra for a profit so I ended up with free shares. Money Observer came to the fore with advice on how to buy and sell, how many to bid for, closing dates and so on. </p> <p>'With building society carpetbagging I checked Money Observer's recommended societies, opened numerous accounts in many, and made a fair profit. I felt a bit guilty doing this and was not surprised when the societies insisted on giving shares only to long-term members. I still have two or three left, so these might still pay off. </p> <p>'After this, I started investing in Peps, Tessas and Isas. Money Observer was always at hand to advise on funds or rates. I remember being disappointed that many investment trusts were initially not available for investment. But over time this has changed to today's quite flexible options. </p> <p>'With the stock market down in recent times I have put significant money into buy-to-let and so far this has worked out well. I have chosen an area in the south with significant demand. </p> <p>'My successes have been planning for retirement from my early thirties, saving using broad-based worldwide funds, particularly investment trusts, investing in housing, privatisations, business expansion schemes and using the internet for savings. </p> <p>'My failures have been following tips and getting emotionally involved with shares, taking on a fixed-rate mortgage because of my belief in Europe and the UK's membership of the exchange rate mechanism and buying Equitable Life endowment policies. </p> <p>'I have achieved all my initial ambitions and retired by 55. But I have been cautious. I have taken Money Observer' s advice to go for broad-based stock market investments, maximise my pension and maintain savings in a high-paying account. It has hardly been an exciting investment strategy, but I have avoided most disasters.'</p> <p><strong>'It has been my primary financial teacher for 25 years'</strong></p> <p>Ron Shelton of Alresford, Hampshire, started his subscription to Money Observer in 1979, when he retired. He says: 'I had a few unit and investment trusts which were not performing, but I had been too busy to look at them - and too ignorant. Money Observer has been my primary teacher and I did fairly well in choosing funds until the last boom. Because I remember the 1920s slump, when a depression was called a depression, and several more since, I was reluctant to invest in the more speculative funds, so I missed the best of the gains and the privatisation booty. </p> <p>'Today I have accepted that what I call the real economy (making things or exporting rather than taking in someone else's washing) no longer matters and that any half-competent fund manager would show a small but steady growth in value, so early in 2000 I passed most of our few assets to the care of one. Now they are worth about 70 per cent of the original value after four years invested in the four \"safe\" managed funds.</p> <p>'The moral is keep active control and read Money Observer or put it all into the savings account and hope its real value will not deteriorate faster than the owner.'</p>",

The inn had three diamonds but the English Tourist Council said it couldn't help as the accommodation had not been inspected recently.<br><strong>PW, Hoddesden</strong> </p> <p>Inspections would not uncover this sort of problem. You had entered into a contract with the inn to provide you with accommodation for those nights. Your problem is proving it was you, not the other Mr and Mrs W, who had phoned. It could have been a genuine mistake - two couples with the same name booked for the same weekend and the staff assumed it was one. Or the other couple, with no booking, impersonated you when they found the inn was full. </p> <p>To avoid this (extremely rare) problem in future, get the name of the person you speak to on the phone, make sure they note your number, ask for a booking reference, leave a credit card number, write a letter to confirm your booking and, the day before, phone to confirm you arrival. </p> <p>The English Tourist Board says it will investigate if you write in. </p> <p><strong> Crash's tragic consequences</strong> </p> <p> A week before we were travelling to Cyprus, my best friend, who I have known since we were four, was killed in a car crash. Her husband and baby survived. I had to cancel our holiday but the tour operator will not give us a replacement and the insurance with LloydsTSB will not compensate us because she wasn't a relative. We have lost \u00a3878.<br><strong>DR, Loughton</strong> </p> <p>Many readers' holidays problems have been unfortunate, but none this tragic.

The utility bill came back with a request for further proof of identity but not my passport. </p> <p>I made several phone calls but, at the end of August, had heard nothing. </p> <p>We want to take a last-minute autumn break but cannot do this.

  "<p>I've read enough - indeed written enough - about Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone over the years to know that you always have to look for an endgame. So when he seems about to pull the plug on the British Grand Prix over a measly few million dollars you have to ask: what does he really want? </p> <p>He is worth more than \u00a32 billion, according to the rich lists, so it cannot be the money. I've no doubt he is angry enough at the Silverstone management to want the whole shebang to go bust, which would also leave him in pole position to pick up the pieces and redevelop the massive site on his own terms. And allow him to crush the last few opponents to his control of the sport. </p> <p>So you can understand why Sir Jackie Stewart wants Number 10 to cough up public funds for Silverstone: virtually all other grand prix tracks in the world receive state subsidy, and by common consent Britain deserves a world class motor racing track. </p> <p>But there is a flaw in his case: any handout will look like it is going straight from the Labour government to Ecclestone. Just remember the fuss the last time Tony Blair and Bernie did business together. And the cash flow was in the opposite direction then.</p> <p><strong>Barclays bogged down in legal quagmire</strong></p> <p>The world's credit derivatives executives meet in New York this week, and there will be only one topic for discussion in the bars of the Hyatt Hotel: the wave of legal actions either in progress or being contemplated against our own dear Barclays Bank. </p> <p>The German HSH Nordbank last week filed a case in London against Matt Barrett's outfit, seeking to recover $150 million of losses it claimed it had incurred as a result of investing in complex financial instruments issued by Barclays. Snappily dubbed collateralised debt obligations - CDOs - they were once slammed as the 'toxic waste' of the financial system by Sir Howard Davies, and seem to have prompted an outbreak of legal excitement from Frankfurt to Tokyo.</p> <p>Barclays is accused of trying to 'fleece' its clients through the use of CDOs, even allegedly short-selling the very instruments they were recommending that their clients invest in.</p> <p>Barclays, of course, denies any blame in the matter. To be fair, CDOs are so complex that it would be massively premature to cast any blame, but there is a suspicion that this could be the tip of a very big iceberg, if only for the legal distraction and cost to Barclays.</p> <p>A settlement has already been reached with another client, the prestigious European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, while whispers from Japan suggest another institution, Yasuda Life, is on the verge of an action over an alleged $127m of losses. I don't think we've heard the last of this.</p> <p><strong>Drink to the success of M&amp;B's Clarke</strong></p> <p>Tim Clarke, chief executive of Mitchells &amp; Butler, had better watch out: if he keeps on like this - profits and shares up, positive market sentiment, well-managed cash-generative businesses - he could go the way of Richard North, his opposite number at InterContinental Hotels. Until last year, the two were joined at the hip in Six Continents, the old Bass group to you and me. Then they split and enjoyed their separate lives. North, it seemed, even more so, because the InterContinental shares performed even better than M&amp;B's 18 per cent rise this year. </p> <p>North is now history, having been ejected in a boardroom coup last month, but Clarke is not about to share his fate. M&amp;B is a good example of a commercially sound, well-marketed and socially responsible drinks company. Clarke played a major role in heading off - temporarily at least - the Hizbollah faction at the Department of Health that wanted to ban smoking in pubs completely. He also recognised that the booze companies should seek to restrain binge-drinking, and the exponential growth in licensed premises that has helped make town centres such awful places at night.</p> <p>Anybody who encourages people to eat along with their drink, the cornerstone of M&amp;B's strategy, is to be commended.</p> <p><strong>A fiddler's lament</strong></p> <p>What is it about the music business that the City fails to understand? Ever since Sir Richard Branson pulled out of the Square Mile after analysts had consistently undervalued his Virgin company (then largely a music business), a string of would-be music moguls have retired hurt from public company status. </p> <p>Last week Irish entrepreneur Vince Power, founder of the Mean Fiddler music and festivals company, effectively did the same, selling his shares in the company that he founded 23 years ago. He is not entirely withdrawing from plc life, as he will stay on as a non-executive and use his expertise in festival organisation for the company's good. He will also keep on running his bars, restaurants and race-course business in the UK, Ireland and France.</p> <p>True, he is taking \u00a312 million with him from the sale of the shares, but that did not seem total consolation when I spoke to him yesterday: 'Try telling somebody in a pin-stripe suit that you're going to make a lot of money out of an empty field in the country and 100,000 people will turn up. They don't get it.'</p> <p>Room for a new kind of venture capitalist here, surely?</p>",
  "<p>America's financial colossus Citigroup is targeting Lloyds TSB and Barclays, according to City investment bankers. They went one step further than Citigroup boss Chuck Prince, who confessed last week that he would like to buy banks in Europe and the UK, but he refused to identify the targets. </p> <p>Prince believes overseas purchases are a real possibility as the price of acquiring US retail banks is now prohibitively high. </p> <p>Insiders at Citigroup's retail offshoot, Citibank, also confirmed that the British clearers are on Citigroup's shopping list, though observers say there are 'no live negotiations'. A Lloyds spokesman declined to comment, while Barclays could not be reached. </p> <p>Analysts say Citigroup needs to expand overseas if it is to increase revenue, and Britain is a prime target as institutions on the continent are often protected by national governments, and cost savings are more difficult to extract because of strict labour protection laws. </p> <p>Barclays, valued at more than \u00a335bn, would be the bigger and more valuable prize for Citigroup, but its own shareholders might balk at the enormous premium Barclays management would be certain to demand. </p> <p>Speculation that Citigroup might pounce on Barclays was intense during the summer, but despite a surge in the British bank's share price, a bid failed to materialise. Two weeks ago, Barclays unveiled plans to buy control of Absa, one of South Africa's largest banks; paradoxically, Citigroup looked at opportunities in SA last year. </p> <p>But Lloyds TSB might be easier to digest for Citigroup: it would be both cheaper - its market value is just \u00a324bn - and easier to wrest from shareholders, who fret that under Eric Daniels it is making insufficient progress in rebuilding its franchise. </p> <p>'If Citigroup went for Lloyds, investors would probably bite its hand off,' said one shareholder. </p> <p>Analysts say Lloyds drifted under former chief executive Peter Ellwood, who stepped down 18 months ago. Under Ellwood, it failed to acquire Abbey National after a competition commission probe in 2001, then reversed its strategy of looking for acquisitions in Europe.</p> <p>Now, Lloyds faces intense competition from a resurgent HBOS, which acquired Bank of Scotland in 2001, and an aggressive Royal Bank of Scotland, which more than doubled in size when it merged with NatWest.</p>",
  "<p>The case of Corinne Maier was one of the media events of the French silly season. Maier, an economist at Electricit\u00e9 de France (EDF), a pillar of the French corporate establishment, wrote a book called Bonjour paresse ('Hello Sloth') which landed its author in a bathful of eau chaude when it was splashed on the front page of Le Monde . </p> <p>Billed as a slacker's manual and subtitled 'of the art and necessity of doing as little as possible at work', Bonjour paresse was a publishing sensation. But it also brought the author a summons to a disciplinary hearing on the grounds of damage to EDF's prestige and the self-esteem of her colleagues.</p> <p>Would she, wouldn't she be sacked? In the event, having been given time to reflect by Maier's defiant departure for a nice holiday ('Everyone knows you can't have a disciplinary hearing in France in August,' she snorted), the company let her off with a warning, an outcome she accepted with remarkably bad grace, muttering darkly about 'harassment'. </p> <p>It's not hard to see why EDF was cross. A nod to Fran\u00e7oise Sagan's dark existential 1954 novel Bonjour tristesse ('Hello Heartache'), Bonjour paresse does a rather more direct job on the existential void at the heart of business. </p> <p>Stingingly written by a formidably well-read intellectual (Maier's other subjects are literature and the famously abstruse psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan), her anti-business polemic pulls no punches. Much of corporate life, says Maier, is quite literally absurd, consisting of empty rituals and arbitrary actions whose only function is to provide the illusion of purpose.</p> <p>Underneath is stasis - 'everything has to change so that everything remains the same' - in which the job of executives is to fill the time between pay cheques by doing nothing as actively as they can.</p> <p>This hollowness is perfectly reflected in corporate speak, of which Maier produces several choice examples, some from EDF. 'Rester leader implique s\u00e9curiser le sourcing et/ou le positionnement du groupe sur le midstream gazier, de m\u00eame qu'identifier un mix/portefeuille de production optimal en fonction du mass market,' gives a flavour, its posturing self-importance even more offensive for its linguistic barbarity ('no man's langue,' as Maier neatly dubs it). </p> <p>Maier's wrecking ball scores many bruising hits, for how could it not? But although she mercilessly exposes the unsayable - the gulf between the seriousness with which top managers regard their activity and the triviality of the object of their pretension, between the claims of flexibility and cool and the stultifying conformity beneath, between rhetorical benevolence and the reality of control - in one crucial respect Maier doesn't go far enough. </p> <p>She shares with the cartoon strip office worker Dilbert, whom she quotes, the unquestioned assumption that corporate existence is inherently meaningless. Hence the advice at the end of the book, which got her into trouble: to sap the business from within by going through the motions while doing as little as possible. </p> <p>But - and this actually doubles the absurdity of today's reality - there is no practical or intellectual reason why business should be like this. </p> <p>Historically, business and trade were civilising influences. As Jane Jacobs has shown, 'le doux commerce' required honesty and trust as well as numeracy to flourish. The first use of writing was to record inventory - crudely, business made literature possible. As Maier herself notes, capitalism's beginnings have been closely linked to the Protestant work ethic. </p> <p>The original sin of modern business, if one can call it that, is not to do with its nature but the practical matter of its organisation. Back in the early days of mass production, standardised products seemed to demand standardised work to churn them out. Hence Fordisation, the defining characteristic of which was command and control and specialisation - the hiving off of thought, management and decision-making from frontline work. </p> <p>Command and control may have enabled huge increases in productivity at the time, but with every day that passes we pay a heavier price for its continuing legacy, the evacuation of purpose from work. One result is the colossal inefficiencies that disfigure almost all organisations in both public and private sectors, with consequences that Maier so clinically describes. </p> <p>She is right to be outraged. But the answer is not passive resistance. In a jokey aside earlier in the book, she fantasises that taking a leaf from French history and chopping off a few heads might be a step forward, a prelude to a new settlement that would at least bring a fairer division of the spoils between the industrial classes, if not a more meaningful existence. </p> <p>Regime change, however, is exactly what's needed. In effect, large companies are the ancien r\u00e9gime, the last surviving practitioners of central planning, as rusted, dysfunctional and archaic as latter-day Soviet Russia. But there's no point in guillotining a few of today's chiefs and replacing them with others of the same ilk. The whole apparatus of command and control must go. </p> <p>So ignore the call to cultivate sloth. Instead, sweep away the entire top-heavy company superstructure, together with all the highly paid courtiers on the executive floor who do nothing but complicate the issues and weigh the company down. Liberate purpose. Put decision-making back into work.

  "<p>I had read the cuttings before I met Lee Amaitis and boy, was I worried. He was the 'Brooklyn bruiser' who ran the 'sleaziest, most disgusting' company in the City; he had threatened to 'take out a contract' on a rival; he encouraged staff to 'go out whoring' and snort cocaine; his anger was legendary; his Anglo-Saxon formidable. With a curtain-raiser like this from the press. I wondered if I'd end up sleeping with the fishes in the Thames. </p> <p> I got out alive, after an anti-climactic hour talking mostly about the new challenge Amaitis faces as chairman and chief executive of BGC, the money-broker spin-off from Cantor Fitzgerald. No horses' heads, no offers I couldn't refuse, and not a line of Bolivian marching powder in sight. </p> <p> Amaitis was soberly dressed in collar and tie, with slicked-back hair and designer-cropped goatee. All aspersions aside, he still looks like the kind of man you'd rather have on your side in a bare-knuckle fight than against you. </p> <p> 'All those things were just somebody else's opinions,' he says when I ask him about his reputation, 'so I just don't comment on them. But I can't say I'm a smooth stone. I have my rough edges and my past, especially in the London media, has been colourful, to say the least.' </p> <p> And that's just since 2001. Until then, Cantor Fitzerald was little-known outside a fairly small circle of City traders, but on 11 September it became synonymous with New York's tragedy when 658 of its employees were among the victims of the attack on the World Trade Centre, the biggest loss of life by a single firm. </p> <p> Amaitis was in Britain on that day and watched on TV as the towers - and much of Cantor's American business - collapsed. 'I felt anger that people could have done that to us and to America,' he recalls. His anger subsided, to grow into a general worry about security and survival. But the events of 9/11 have contributed to a change in the way Cantor does business, and led indirectly to the establishment of BGC, which officially started up last week. </p> <p> Cantor's money-broking business had been pulled in two directions long before the attacks in America. Inter-dealer brokers act as middle men between the world's big financial institutions when they want to lend money to each other on terms of anonymity, often for short periods. </p> <p> Technological advances in the 1990s meant electronic dealing was becoming an increasingly attractive way of doing business at the expense of old-style 'voice' broking, which had originated in the trading pits. Cantor provided both. </p> <p> Tragically, Cantor's voice brokers were the main victims of 9/11. The electronic systems could be restarted and trading resumed within hours of the disaster from its back-up site in Connecticut, but there was silence on the other end of the phone for those who wanted inter-dealing broker services. It brought about a rethink of how Cantor did business, and the result was BGC. </p> <p> 'I'm very excited,' says Amaitis. 'I've never been a chairman before and I have a business that presents challenges and opportunities.' </p> <p> The strategy is to start again in voice broking, but from London, and to try to win back global market share from the BGC base in America Square in the City. The operation was formally unveiled in August, but Amaitis had the headhunters in long before that. </p> <p> 'We've been hiring for the past six months and have attracted a lot of talent,' he says, estimating that the firm has hired around 100 new employees and there is still no end in sight to the hiring spree. 'If the talent keeps coming, it can produce profit and we'll keep hiring.' </p> <p> Which hits on the other reason Amaitis and Cantor have been in the headlines since 2001. After an initial wave of sympathy, rivals began to see that the events in New York had destabilised Cantor and its top stars were easy to lure away. A series of court cases followed in which Cantor alleged unfair practices, and former employees countered with lurid tales of corporate life under Amaitis. Most notably Steven Horkulak, a senior director who claimed to have been outraged and intimidated by his boss's ripe language and energetic social life. </p> <p> 'I'm a passionate guy,' admits Amaitis. 'I accept responsibility for what goes on and I've got to make sure it goes the right way. I have to make it work.' </p> <p> This time, BGC is motivating its staff with the chance to rebuild a business and a chunk of the partnership structure it has agreed with Cantor. 'One of the reasons for the partnership is to ensure loyalty. The structure means that you decide what to pay yourself,' he says. </p> <p> But he seems to have learnt a lesson from the legal episodes. There have been no anger-management lessons, no counselling sessions on intra-personal relationship s, but he says: 'Maybe I take a couple of seconds longer to think before I speak. But I will never lose the passion. You have to have that.' </p> <p> His life has something of the American dream about it. His father was an emigr\u00e9 from Lithuania who worked in the Pennsylvania coal mines before moving to New York when the industry started running down. His mother was born in America, of Lithuanian descent. Young Lee left high school in the mid-1960 and 'pursued a career in the thoroughbred racing industry'. </p> <p> By the 1980s, he was running his own broking business until joining Cantor Fitzgerald as managing director in 1995. In between, there were brushes with the law for drug abuse and a spell in rehab for alcohol dependency - all woven into his myth. </p> <p> Those hellfire days seem to be well and truly over. His fianc\u00e9e is expecting their second child and he is as proud as any father to show off pictures of her and his young boy, Vincent Michael (named after two friends who died on 9/11). His leisure time is spent with his family, he says. He doesn't mention lap-dancing clubs or cocaine, and I don't ask. </p> <p> The business will take up most of his time now. Money broking is a fiercely competitive market in London, dominated by larger-than-life characters, such as Icap's Michael Spencer and Terry Smith of Collins Stewart Tullet. </p> <p> 'I don't worry much about the opposition,' he says. 'We have a different game plan. We're starting from scratch. And I've always regarded technology as an aid to back up trust and relationship. I came out of the pit, where we did deals not even on a handshake, but on a voice deal.' </p> <p> I said goodbye as BGC staff prepared a drinks party to celebrate their new firm. Amaitis said he would be in the office until seven if I needed to check anything. I got away.

  "<p>The documentary Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, over which the band exercised complete editorial control, was made over two years during which they worked on their first album of this century and then embarked on their first tour since the 1990s. The picture is like This Is Spinal Tap for real, an unintentionally hilarious excursion into the lives of a group of self-regarding, inarticulate, constantly warring rock artists. </p> <p>What makes Metallica especially amusing is that a lot of it centres on the band's sessions with a therapist who calls himself a 'performance-enhancement coach', hired by the group's management to help resolve personal and professional discords.

  "<p>L ife needn't be a slippery slope into old age. Activities such as skiing that were once seen as the province of the youthful are now opening up to older adventurers - and even the insurance companies are waking up to the market. </p> <p>You can enjoy a mid-winter skiing holiday even if you have never been anywhere near a piste. All it takes is a little planning and some effort to raise your physical fitness. Age is no barrier, as most indoor ski slopes in the UK offer special early afternoon training sessions aimed at over-50s. </p> <p>You do not have to shell out on expensive ski gear either, as the price of the lessons will typically include equipment hire. And if you are concerned about broken bones: over the years, advances in technology and ergonomics in the design of boots and skis has made the sport a lot safer. </p> <p>You do not even have to go to an Alpine slope for the thrill of downhill skiing on the real stuff. There are two venues in the UK with indoor slopes and real snow to learn to ski, and another, Braehead, Glasgow under construction. </p> <p>Xscape in Milton Keynes (tel: 0871-222-5670), boasts two 170m slopes and a 135m nursery slope bearing 1,500 tons of perfect snow. And the Castleford Xscape (tel: 0871-222-5671) near Leeds has a single 150m main slope and a separate 40m training slope. </p> <p>Prices for one-hour lessons start at \u00a326, three hour fast track training will cost \u00a368 and Xscape offers Ski-in a-day, an eight-hour package for \u00a3150. All prices include hire of boots, skis and helmets, but you will need your own gloves. </p> <p>High Wycombe-based Wycombe Summit (tel: 01494-474-711) operates the longest dry ski slope in the UK, offering lessons in a relaxed, sociable atmosphere under the watchful eye of qualified instructors. Afternoon sessions last two hours, with a break for tea, and are \u00a311.50 for over-50s. </p> <p>Telford Snowboard &amp; Ski Centre (tel: 01952-586-862), which has an outdoor all-weather 85m dry ski slope, runs an adult ski school for the over-50s with two-hour lessons costing \u00a39.20. </p> <p>If you would rather learn to ski on the piste, The Ski School, of CairnGorm Mountain (tel: 01479-861-319), offers a four-hour lesson. Prices start at \u00a355 for the over-60s and include all equipment hire and lift passes, but you will need to bring your own gloves and goggles. CairnGorm Mountain is Scotland's most popular ski area, near the village of Aviemore. </p> <p>Amanda Shepherd, owner of the school, says that most people need just the one four-hour session to get slope ready and performing basic turns. The rest is practise. The school uses video cameras to help you correct mistakes through direct observation of your performance on the slope. </p> <p>Ms Shepherd advises that before you start ski lessons, it is sensible to raise your stamina. Although you do not need to be super fit, the fitter you are, the higher your learning capability and the lower the chances of aches and pains spoiling the experience. </p> <p>Ms Shepherd recommends cardio-vascular work such as walking, swimming and cycling. The more stamina you build up, the longer you can stay on the snow without being involved in an accident because you are fatigued. </p> <p>However, while it is true that skiing is typically associated with injuries, statistics show that for every 1,000 people skiing or snowboarding on any particular day in European resorts, only two to four will sustain serious injuries. </p> <p>This brings us neatly to insurance. There is no shortage of special deals and over-50s should expect to pay around \u00a327 for a single trip of up to 10 days to any European ski resort and around \u00a350 if you are skiing in the US or Canada. </p> <p>Check that the fine print covers medical and air ambulance costs, legal expenses, personal baggage, money and ski equipment, irrespective of whether it is hired or your own. The policy should also protect against piste closure and foul weather delays, plus full cover when you are off-piste. </p> <p> M ost policies either limit cover to recognised trails or extend it off-piste only if the insured is accompanied by a qualified instructor. </p> <p>There are several insurers such as Direct Travel Insurance, Columbus, Insure and Go, and Preferential who offer all-round no-quibble cover. Tesco and Ski Club of GB also give all-terrain cover but are a little more expensive. </p> <p>Travel premiums tend to rise sharply when the policyholder is 65 or older. Insurers argue that the risk of falling ill overseas and incurring large medical bills is that much greater. </p> <p>Careful scrutinising of exclusion clauses pays off, and it is always prudent to get several quotes. Before buying, be sure to give a detailed medical history. As a rough guide, premiums nearly double for those aged over 65. Saga has no upper age limit on its winter sports policy. </p> <p>If, after a few weeks of fitness training and a course of lessons you are now ready to head to a ski resort, avoid the higher prices and queues of February half-term. </p> <p>And it may be wise next year to avoid Lech and Z\u00fcrs in the Austrian Alps, which are the settings for the second Bridget Jones movie The Edge of Reason, which opens in December. The hills may be abuzz with the sound of thirtysomething unattached women. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Margaret Hughes is away</p>",
  "<p>Tickets for Royal Ascot go on sale on Monday. But the roads of eastern Berkshire will be unusually quiet for a week next June.

There are 90 rooms, a swimming pool, spa and gym. </p> <p><strong> How much?</strong> From \u00a355 room only, three-night minimum stay (01709 702701, <a href=\"http://www.hellabyhallhotel.co.uk\">hellabyhallhotel.co.uk</a>). </p> <p><strong> Boar's Head, Ripley</strong><br></p> <p> This quaint, 25-room former coaching inn currently has no minimum stay requirement for Ascot week. Antiques and paintings from Ripley Castle - of which the hotel is part - are dotted about. Ususally under an hour's drive to York. </p> <p><strong> How much? </strong> From \u00a390 half-board (01423 771888, <a href=\"http://www.boarsheadripley.co.uk\">boarsheadripley.co.uk</a>). </p> <p><strong> Black Swan Hotel, Helmsley</strong><br></p> <p> Helmsley is a pleasant little town on the edge of the Hambleton Hills and the North York Moors. Bring walking boots as the area is worth exploring. The oak-beamed Black Swan is a 45-minute drive to York.</p> <p> <strong> How much? </strong> From \u00a3120 B&amp;B, minimum three nights (01439 770466, macdonald-hotels.co.uk). </p> <p><strong> Feversham Arms Hotel, Helmsley</strong> </p> <p> Seventeen rooms, an outdoor pool, gym, tennis courts and a renowned restaurant. Rooms have duck-down duvets, DVD players and Bang &amp; Olufsen TVs. \"It's not a country house hotel; equally we're not a designer hotel where looks come before comfort,\" says owner Simon Rhatigan. </p> <p><strong> How much? </strong> From \u00a3118, dinner B&amp;B, minimum five nights (01439 770766, <a href=\"http://www.favershamarmshotel.com\">favershamarmshotel.com</a>). </p> <p><strong> The Parsonage Hotel, Escrick</strong><br></p> <p> Expect quite a few racing folk to be staying here, so keep ears open for a few tips over the cornflakes.

Normally an hour's drive from York, and a great location for exploring the Dales. </p> <p><strong> How much? </strong> From \u00a3180, dinner B&amp;B, minimum three nights (01756 718111, <a href=\"http://www.devonshirehotels.co.uk\">devonshirehotels.co.uk</a>). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> All prices are per person per night for the Royal Ascot at York period and based on two sharing.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Geting there: </strong> Tickets for Royal Ascot at York go on sale Monday (01344 876876, <a href=\"http://www.ascot.co.uk\">ascot.co.uk</a>): general admission from \u00a318, grandstand from \u00a350.

  "<p>When, like me, you write a trailblazing column of far-reaching import, you're often asked questions by trembling no-marks desperate to gain some insight into genius. Questions like \"how do you get to see the programmes in advance?\" (I don't - it's all guesswork), and \"what's with all the needless scatological references?\" (to be fair, that one's usually posed by the editor).</p> <p>But perhaps the most frequently-asked question is \"hey, Captain Cynical - have you ever seen a programme you actually ENJOYED, hmm?\"</p> <p>Well as luck would have it, I can answer that by drawing your attention to two excellent programmes on this very week. For starters, there's US sitcom <strong>Arrested Development</strong> (Wed, 10pm, BBC2), which is great and fantastic and all ace and that.</p> <p>Best described as a cross-splicing of Six Feet Under and The Simpsons, Arrested Development revolves around the Bluth dynasty, a spectacularly spoiled mess of a family, with a patriarch in prison and a solitary sane member attempting to salvage their business interests while the rest do their best to undermine him.</p> <p>On paper that scenario sounds like a vehicle for witty, acidic putdowns - and it is - but it's also packed with sight gags and stupidity and the same hand-rubbing enthusiasm for daft jokes that powers The Simpsons.</p> <p>And thankfully, the performances match the quality of writing. It's always nice to see Jeffrey Tambor (aka the pitiful Hank from Larry Sanders) even when he's dressed in an eye-searing orange prison jumpsuit, and the rest of the cast are equally superb - even the child actors can act, for God's sake. How, precisely, are the Americans breeding these people?</p> <p>In fact, it's so good I'm going to shut up about it now - just make sure you tune in and get hooked: the more people watching, the less likely BBC2 are to \"do a Seinfeld\" and start moving it restlessly around the timetables until it attains mythical status without anyone, bar the schedulers, actually knowing when it's on.</p> <p>Second thumbs-up of the week goes to <strong>City Of Men</strong> (Tue, 10.30pm, BBC4), a Brazilian TV spin-off from the fantastic City Of God. Like the movie, it centres on the blighted lives of slum kids, was shot on location, and features a cast with real-life stories to tell.</p> <p>The series revolves around Acerola, a 13-year-old street kid (Douglas Silva, who played Little Dice in the movie), through whose eyes we experience a nightmare world of drugs, poverty and relentless, remorseless violence. All of which sounds so monumentally depressing you're probably already weeping, but wait: like the movie, it's incredibly watchable. Cleverly, the storylines hinge on the small, everyday challenges that confront Acerola - such as getting a new pair of trainers, or saving enough money to go on a school trip - with the harsh realities of slum life providing a constant menacing background hum. It's a bit like watching Gonch from Grange Hill trying to run a ginger beer stall in the middle of war-torn Chechnya, although about 10,000 times less flippant than that makes it sound.</p> <p>In fact the sole problem with City Of Men is that's entertaining first and \"worthy\" second - in other words, and to quote Johnny Rotten out of context, it provides a cheap holiday in other people's misery. Like a heart-rending feature on Rwandan orphans in the middle of a glossy Sunday magazine, it gives pampered western milquetoasts like you and me a chance to feel somehow engaged with the world, to feel concerned, well-informed, and sympathetic - but only from a safe distance. It might go well with a glass of pinot grigio, but no matter how much you like it, no matter how much you wring your hands and blub about how desperately sad the world is, unless you're moved to board a flight to Brazil with a 1,000-point plan of action in your pocket, all you've done is enjoyed the spectacle.</p> <p>Yeah, that's you told. Now just you think about that, while I ride off on this high horse, bumping my head against the stratosphere as I go.</p>",
  "<p>Microsoft will acquire \"life and death power\" over the entire digital media market for years to come if the European commission's sanctions against the US software group are suspended, Europe's second highest court was told yesterday. </p> <p>On the second day of Microsoft's application to lift EU penalties imposed in March, when the commission fined it a record \u20ac497m (\u00a3340m), the company's lawyers told the court of first instance that forcing it to offer a version of its Windows operating system without its Media Player audio-visual software would cause the firm irreparable damage. </p> <p>But James Flynn, lawyer for the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said: \"If Microsoft acquires another dominant position, it will have power of life and death over all digital formats, not just in computers but in mobile phones and other devices.\" </p> <p>Antoine Winckler, appearing for RealNetworks, maker of the biggest rival player to Microsoft's, warned that without regulatory intervention there was a real risk of \"abandoning tomorrow's essential media distribution channel to a monopoly\". </p> <p>He said: \"Virtually all media - news, movies, music and business communications - will be distributed in digital form. A company that dominates the media player market can control how digital media content is created, delivered, secured and played.\" </p> <p>Microsoft's opponents argued that the software group would gradually squeeze its rivals out of the market and damage consumer choice - as it had with internet browsers, they said. Mr Winckler said that having taken a 60% share of the media player market in only five years, Microsoft was well on the way to \"tipping\" the market forever in its favour.</p>",
  "<p>Sam Clark comes tripping into the square in a tiny Andalucian village in the hills of Las Alpujarras. He is wearing a dark blue linen shirt, calf-length beige cut-offs, sandals and a cream peaked golf cap. Spot the Englishman. </p> <p>Sam - Samuel - Clark is quintessentially English. English in a rather old-fashioned way. His jaw is firm, his hair flops down over his broad forehead. He is lanky and shy and charming. So sorry, he says, but Sam - his wife, Samantha - isn't here. She is taking their two children, Luke and Eve, out on an expedition. Luke is four, he explains, and Eve two, and two small children need endless diversion. </p> <p>Sam and Sam Clark are something of a phenomenon in the restaurant world - aside from the name, which makes writing about them slightly confusing. Together with Mark Sainsbury, they own and run Moro, in Exmouth Market, in the Clerkenwell area of London, which has proved a tremendous popular as well as critical success. It's a relaxed, informal place specialising in what the Good Food Guide described in the restaurant's early days as \"the culinary legacy of the Moorish occupation of Spain from the eighth to the 15th centuries\". Nigel Slater is an enthusiast: \"You might catch a touch of saffron or cumin, of paprika, pepper or pomegranate, yet no matter how often you visit, there is always something you have never tasted before - membrillo, perhaps, or manchego, esqueixada or mojama.\" Moro celebrates its eighth anniversary this year, with no sign that its popularity is on the wane. </p> <p>\"We were lucky,\" says Sam as he sits in the sitting-cum-dining room of Casa Moro, the house that he and Samantha bought in the village four years ago and have been renovating and adding to ever since. From the outside the house looks small, painted white as is the local custom, but once inside it is not unlike the Tardis, extending magically up, down and sideways in a series of jumbled rooms. The shutters are closed against the ferocious heat. On the table is a bowl of olives swimming in rich, golden-green oil, a small wooden board on which sit thin slices of chorizo and a bag of short, stumpy breadsticks that snap explosively in the mouth. Sam is tearing yesterday's bread into chunks and putting them into a bowl. He pours on a splash or two of vinegar - \"from a neighbour\" - and then a gurgle or three of olive oil. </p> <p>\"When we decided to set up on our own, the obvious thing would have been to do Italian food,\" says Sam, \"but we couldn't have been another River Cafe, where we had both worked. We loved it there, and we have a huge respect for Rose [Gray] and Ruthie [Rogers], but you can't copy them. The River Cafe is unique. And we didn't want to be just another Italian restaurant. At that time, no one was doing Spanish or North African food really seriously in London, and those seemed good places to start. I knew a bit about Spanish food, which I liked a lot. So we spent three months in a camper van, travelling all over Spain and Morocco collecting recipes, and then opened the restaurant.\" </p> <p>He chops some onion and garlic with that mesmerising speed of the professional chef, then peels a lumpy cucumber and roughly chops that, adding each ingredient to the bowl as he goes. Everything has a deceptive ease about it. He quarters some cardinal-red tomatoes that are just golden at one end, then breaks them up in the bowl still further with his hands, squeezing out the seeds. Then he moves through into the tiny kitchen with its laden plate racks, sink, ordinary domestic cooker, cupboards bursting with kitchen impedimenta, restricted worksurface cluttered with peppers and heads of garlic, containers of salt, teapot, coffeepot, bits and bobs. He pulls a hand blender out of a stuffed drawer with some difficulty and, moving various bottles and bric-a-brac out of the way, plugs it into a wall socket. </p> <p>\"The Spanish housewives love these,\" he says. \"They use them all the time.\" Then he reduces the contents of the bowl to a liquid mush. He strains the resulting pink liquid through a kind of conical colander into another bowl. He puts a handful of ice cubes into the soup and pops it into the freezer box at the top of the fridge. \"Gazpacho,\" he says. \"It'll be ready in 10 minutes or so.\" </p> <p>Their first book, Moro, The Cookbook, was a phenomenon in itself. It has sold more than 100,000 copies in hardback and paperback, which, for authors without the platform of a regular cookery slot in a national or Sunday newspaper or a TV series to back it up, is prodigious. The recipes were tempting and accessible and the resulting dishes had the robust, well-defined flavours that are the Clarks' hallmark. </p> <p>The new book, Casa Moro, explores the same Muslim Mediterranean and Catholic Spanish culinary and cultural universe as the first, but with a rather different emphasis. The recipes may be culled from Spain, Turkey and Morocco among other countries, but, as the photographs make clear, this is family food, the kind of food they have been making for me at Casa Moro. Indeed, there is a section devoted to the seasonal dishes of the Alpujarras. As Samantha says, \"This is a book for the home.\" </p> <p>\"When I first tasted penne all'arrabbiata at the River Cafe,\" Sam remembers, \"I thought it was one of the most wonderful things I had ever eaten. And what is it? Just pasta with olive oil, garlic, tomatoes - tinned tomatoes - and chilli. I love that essential simplicity, but it also has intensity, vividness and balance. There's a kind of wholeness about a dish of that kind. It's rooted in the country it comes from. I think that's what cooking is about.\" </p> <p>Both of them first experienced the joys of good cooking as children. Samantha says that her mother was an excellent home cook, and remembers warmly visits to her grandmother's house in the south of France - \"before it was spoiled by Brigitte Bardot and Roger Vadim\". </p> <p>Casa Moro and the Andalusian village are about as far removed from the self-regarding world of the London restaurant scene and the bustling buzz of Exmouth Market as it is possible to imagine. There, the contemporary constants of restaurant life - battles with suppliers, two energy-sapping performances a day, sniping critics, rules, regulations, staff, profit, loss. Here, the constants seem eternal - the heat, the cold, sunshine, water, survival. Time has a different pulse here. It seems to run more slowly, more steadily, compared with the immediate, febrile, fitful beat of London. </p> <p>Sam points out of the window to a tiny field on the other side of the lane. \"It's a real marker for the seasons,\" he says. \"If we come here in January, we'll see the man who owns it sowing the wheat. In spring, it turns that fresh, pale green as it sprouts. Then, in summer, it'll be golden brown, and in the autumn we watch the man and his wife cutting it, by hand, with scythes, you know, with long, regular sweeps, so that the bundles fall perfectly one after the other.\" </p> <p>The 10 minutes have passed and we eat the gazpacho. It is cool, elegant, clean and gently penetrating. It is as easy to eat one, two, three bowls as it had appeared to be to make. Then we have huevos revueltos con morcilla - loosely scrambled eggs with black pudding. There were runner beans in the mix, too, but neither of us knew the Spanish for runner beans. The dish was mild, gentle, soothing. </p> <p>Presently, Samantha, Luke and Eve return in the usual noisy tumble that goes with two young children. Samantha has the same reserve and charm as her husband. She is watchful, too, and tranquil in the midst of the surrounding noise and activity. There is nothing cynical or vain or egocentric about either of the Clarks. They have never been part of the cheffy circuit. When they eat out, they prefer the Turkish, Thai and Vietnamese eating places of north London to the sleek chic of the gastro-zeitgeist. A natural shyness, inherent seriousness and sense of professional responsibility have meant that, with the exception of a short-lived bit of empire-building involving a restaurant called Le Maquis, a modern French outfit that never matched Moro's flair or individuality, Moro has occupied all their energies. </p> <p>They speak about the restaurant and the people who work there with warmth and affection, and each year they take on a trainee chef as part of Jamie Oliver's Cheeky Chops charity. Samantha worked with Oliver at the River Cafe and speaks highly of his energy, skill and commitment, as well as of the benefits of the scheme. \"We notice that even a short time in the kitchen can really help build their self-esteem and confidence. You can see them blossom.\" </p> <p>The arrival of Luke and Eve lessened the Clarks' taste for the industry whirligig still further. Sam points out, \"Every day in the restaurant is like giving a very taxing performance. Between that and the demands of the children it doesn't leave a lot of energy for anything else.\" This is one reason the new book took rather longer to write than they had expected. They had to take it in turns to disappear to Casa Moro for a few weeks at a time just to get it done, and the house became the heart of the book. </p> <p>They never set out to buy the house. \"I was just playing around on the internet,\" says Samantha, \"really just learning what it could do. And I typed in Andalusia to see what came up and, before I realised what was happening, I was looking at all these estate agents' particulars for farmhouses and other buildings. And then, of course, I couldn't stop there ...\" </p> <p>The introduction to the new book takes up the story: \"It was quite by chance we found this place, and when we got out the map, we realised we must have passed through the Alpujarras, the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, in our camper van eight years earlier. We took a small road that led to a pueblo (village) and, folding in the wing mirrors, squeezed the car through the narrow streets and parked. We walked up a lane until we came to a stone wall with a warped wooden door. After a couple of kicks it swung open to reveal a neglected garden, overgrown fig, jasmine, brambles and wild garden, and at the end was a small dwelling.\" </p> <p>The wooden door in the wall has since been replaced by one that isn't warped, but the fig is still there, and the jasmine and wild grasses. A child's paddling pool occupies a large part of one side of the small garden, and a table made of a door covered by a sheet of glass on waffle building blocks the other. And all around are the Alpujarras, arid, burnt-brown in high summer. The sides of the hills - they are not quite mountains - are precipitous, rocky and austere. But terraces have been quarried out of them on which olive and almond trees are drawn up in ranks. Marcona almonds, treasured for their sweet, mild flavour and flat shape, are the major product of this part of Spain. There are other trees, too - walnuts, persimmons, pomegranates and poplars - further down the slopes, hazy through the dusty gold of the late afternoon sun. </p> <p>While they prepare dinner, Sam and Sam switch effortlessly back and forth between cooking and child-minding, each picking up where the other left off, needing no word of explanation or direction. Living and working together \"took a bit of getting used to\" when they got married in 1996 after meeting while cooking at the Eagle in Clerkenwell. But they now seem perfectly in tune with one another - a kind of seamless team, rather at odds with their disjointed family histories. </p> <p>Both were brought up by their mothers, although they maintain good relations with their fathers. Perhaps this is why they show such patient and minute involvement with Luke and Eve. Sam manages to fit in a game of what he calls Mr McGregor between cooking duties. It involves arranging the furniture around the sitting room to provide various boltholes for Peter Rabbit in the form of a shrieking Luke, who dashes from one to the other, one step ahead of Mr McGregor in the form of Sam. At one point, Samantha apologises for not talking more: \"The children,\" she says, \"they take up a lot of time.\" </p> <p>There is an almost hippyish innocence about their way of life, sorted between their house in north London, the restaurant and Casa Moro, bounded by friends and food and children. Do they ever fight? Rarely over food, says Samantha, directing the question to the area that is fundamental to their relationship. \"We have both worked in the same restaurants, so our approach to cooking is very similar.\" They discuss food constantly, assessing the quality of the peaches, greengages, olives, chorizo, mulling over the merits of wild rabbit as opposed to farmed. They communicate through food. It becomes a domestic lingua franca. But they are no food snobs. Luke and Eve complain of hunger pangs and are quietened with a bowl of chocolate-flavoured cornflakes - quietened, that is, until the flakes become instruments of war. Tomato ketchup has its place in the kitchen cupboard, too, and \"I have a weakness for good sausages between bad bread,\" says Sam. </p> <p>That evening, we sit at the table outside eating kid - \"from a woman who lives in the next village up the hill. You can get really good ingredients around here. The market's aren't that good, but there are decent food shops in the bigger village down the road.\" The kid has been marinated and then grilled over an open fire. It has the spicy sweetness of an animal that had grazed on the aromatic scrub of the hills, overlaid by the caramel and faint edge of crisp, burnt surface. There is a dish of aubergines and pinenuts to go with it, and a plate of sliced tomatoes seasoned with sweet white onion and dressed just in olive oil, and red wine to drink. </p> <p>This part of Andalusia, says Sam, was until recently the poorest in Europe - would have been a lot poorer, too, had it not been for the complex network of irrigation channels built by the Moors in the 13th century and still in prime working order today, channelling water from the snow-fed rivers high in the Sierra Nevada, coursing down the hillsides to water small fields of beans, tomatoes, courgettes and other vegetables. He likes this connection between the past and the present. It is the kind of connection that informs their food. </p> <p>\"Of course, there is a historical connection between the cooking of North Africa and Spain,\" he says. \"They have so many ingredients in common - almonds, rice, aubergines, pinenuts. Spanish food is richer and earthier, I think. You get those wonderful deep flavours that come from slow-cooking techniques, as well as the use of oil, garlic, onion, pimenton, saffron and chorizo. And I love the way they add richness to richness, like adding a lump of pork fat to chickpeas when you are cooking them, to give that extra depth. North African cooking is lighter. You also find slow-cooking techniques there - North African tagines give you the same kind of richness that you find in Spanish braises and pot roasts - but, on the whole, the food is lighter and fresher-tasting. They use yogurt, preserved lemons, parsley, mint and spices such as cumin, cloves and cinnamon.\" </p> <p>\"We are always looking for those kinds of qualities in food,\" he continues. \"I don't think we are too concerned about authenticity. For example, in the restaurant we'll put, say, two vegetables on a plate with the main meat or fish, which is something no Spaniard would do. Every chef tries to put their own mark on a dish, but as soon as you do that, is a dish 'authentic' any more, in the pure sense of the word? Even in the restaurant, the chefs we work with don't always do things the way we would do them. Sometimes we come across a dish and we think, well, we can tweak it this way or that way, add this or that. But we try to remain true to the spirit of the original dish. It should always come back to that combination of intensity, directness and balance.\" </p> <p>These qualities have their foundation in the finest ingredients. When the Clarks opened Moro, they were forced to make weekly shopping trips to a Turkish supermarket in Dalston, north-east London, to buy what they needed. Now suppliers are beating a path to their door. Nevertheless, there is a thoughtful addendum to the Casa Moro cookbook in which they lay out the principles that guide their purchasing policies - organic, British, where possible, including vegetables and fish from sustainable sources - and provide a list of suppliers. </p> <p>Where next? Luke starts nursery school soon, so Samantha is looking forward to increasing the number of shifts she does at the restaurant - \"I'm really itchy to get into the kitchen more\" - albeit working at different times from her husband, so that they can maintain a constant presence for Luke and Eve. And then there's the constant search for new ideas, recipes, inspirations. They like to change the menu at Moro every two weeks or so, and they are planning a trip to the Lebanon, the cooking of which they have yet to explore seriously. </p> <p>And another book? They smile enigmatically. </p> <p><strong>Potato cakes stuffed with minced lamb and pine nuts</strong><br> </p> <p>We think this street food comes from Iran, but these flavours could just as easily appear in Lebanon or Syria. At the restaurant, we serve them with a little yogurt and salad. You could follow this recipe to make a type of shepherd's pie for two. Omit the flour with the potatoes and instead add 300ml warm milk, then assemble and cook as for a shepherd's pie. Makes 4 cakes. </p> <p>For the potato dough </p> <p>700g potatoes (Desir\u00e9e, Cyprus or King Edwards), skins on<br> 1 rounded tbsp plain flour, plus extra for dusting<br> Sea salt<br> </p> <p>For the lamb filling </p> <p>25g butter<br> 2 tbsp olive oil<br> large or 1 medium onion, finely chopped<br> 1 tsp ground cinnamon<br> 2 pinches freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg<br> 3 cardamom pods, black seeds only, ground to a fine powder<br> 3 cloves, ground with a pinch of salt to a powder<br> 200g finely minced lamb shoulder<br> 50g pine nuts, lightly toasted or fried until golden<br> 1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e<br> 3 tbsp chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> Sea salt and black pepper<br> </p> <p>To cook and serve </p> <p>Olive oil<br> 1 bunch wild rocket, dressed with 1 tbsp lemon juice, 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper<br> 200g Greek yogurt, thinned with 2 tbsp milk and seasoned with 1 garlic clove crushed with salt<br> A few pickled chillies, or 1 lemon, cut into wedges<br> </p> <p>To make the dough, boil the potatoes whole in salted water until cooked but not mushy: if they start to break up, they will absorb more water, which may affect the way they handle and fry. Drain well for 10 minutes. Then, while they are still warm, peel and mash. Stir in the flour and season with salt. The potato dough is now ready. </p> <p>While the potatoes are boiling, make the filling. Melt the butter with the olive oil over a medium to high heat. When the butter begins to foam, add the onion and soften until it is sweet and slightly caramelised. Now add all the spices and cook for a minute. Add the lamb, stirring and breaking it up with a spoon as it begins to cook. Stop stirring for a minute or two, so the lamb has a chance to stick to the pan and colour. This will add depth of flavour to the dish. You should cook the lamb for about 5-8 minutes until nicely browned. Finally, stir in the pine nuts, tomato pur\u00e9e, 2 tablespoons water and the parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside until cool enough to handle. </p> <p>To prepare the potato cakes, first wash and dry your hands, then flour them. Divide the dough into four balls. Keeping the surface well dusted with flour, flatten one ball to a disc 1cm thick. Put 2 tablespoons of filling in the centre, and bring up the sides of the dough to enclose the meat. Place on a floured surface. Neaten the shape of the cake and patch up any cracks and gaps. The result should look like a round patty 10cm across and 3-4cm thick. Repeat with the other balls of dough. These cakes will keep in the fridge for one or two days, as long as there's enough flour to prevent them from sticking (but the fresher they're eaten, the better). </p> <p>Cover the bottom of a large frying pan generously with oil, about 3-4mm deep, and place over a medium to high heat until nearly smoking. Gently lift up the cakes with a fish spatula and lower into the oil one by one. Do not disturb until they are a dark golden colour and crispy, then turn carefully to colour the other side. When they are done, take out and dab off any excess oil with kitchen paper. Keep warm in a low oven, or serve immediately with the rocket, yogurt and chillies or lemon. </p> <p><strong>Moroccan bread salad with grilled green peppers and tomatoes</strong><br> </p> <p>This is a version of the classic Moroccan salad of grilled green peppers and tomatoes with the addition of bread and nutty argan oil. If you cannot find argan oil, use olive oil. Serves 6-8 as a mezze, 4 for a starter or light meal. </p> <p>4 green peppers, grilled and peeled<br> 225g ciabatta, half the crust removed<br> 600g cherry or any sweet tomatoes, peeled, cut into quarters or eighths<br> 4 tbsp fresh coriander leaves<br> 2 tbsp roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> 120g oily black olives<br> Sea salt and black pepper<br> </p> <p>For the dressing </p> <p>1 garlic clove, crushed to a paste with salt<br> 1 rounded tsp lightly pan-roasted cumin seeds, roughly ground<br> 1 tbsp sweet red-wine vinegar<br> 100g tomatoes, sliced and pur\u00e9ed to juice<br> 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br> 3 tbsp argan oil, plus 1 extra tbsp mixed with tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br> </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. While the peppers are charring, break up the bread into bite-sized pieces and place on a roasting tray. Put in the oven for 10 minutes until lightly toasted. Meanwhile, peel and tear the peppers into strips and make the dressing. In a bowl, mix the garlic with the cumin, vinegar, tomato juice, salt and black pepper. Add the olive oil and the 3 tablespoons of argan oil and whisk well. Taste for seasoning. </p> <p>When the bread is ready, transfer to a large salad bowl and pour over half the dressing. Give it a good toss and allow to sit for a few seconds before adding the peppers, tomatoes, herbs and olives. Pour on the remaining dressing, toss again and check the seasoning. Serve with the remaining argan and olive oil drizzled on top. </p> <p><strong>Mussels with harissa</strong><br> </p> <p>Serves 6-8 as a mezze, 4 for a starter or light meal. </p> <p>1kg mussels or small-to-medium clams<br> 4 tbsp olive oil<br> 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br> 100g harissa<br> 3 tbsp roughly chopped fresh coriander<br> Sea salt and black pepper<br> Extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling<br> </p> <p>Wash the mussels under cold water, discarding any that are open or broken. Clean well and pull off any beards. Drain. In a large saucepan, heat the oil over a medium heat. When hot but not smoking, add the garlic and fry for a few seconds until it just begins to colour. Add the mussels, the harissa and half the coriander, and cook, covered for the first 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the mussels begin to open and release their juices, shaking the pan as you go. Then cook uncovered for a further minute or two until the shells have opened fully. (Throw away any that are still closed.) Taste for seasoning; the mussels may need a little salt. Serve immediately with the remaining coriander, an extra drizzle of olive oil over the top, and bread. </p> <p><strong>Lomo con vinagre de Jerez (pork loin pot-roasted with sherry and sherry vinegar)</strong><br> </p> <p>The complex flavours of sherry and sherry vinegar make a wonderful sweet-sour sauce to complement this dish. Serves 4-6. </p> <p>1-1.5kg boned organic or free-range pork loin, trimmed of most of its fat, or lean belly, skin off<br> Sea salt and black pepper<br> 2 tbsp olive oil<br> 75g butter<br> 2 medium red onions, halved and thinly sliced<br> 4 sprigs fresh thyme, or a pinch of dried thyme<br> 2 bay leaves (preferably fresh)<br> 300ml Pedro Xim\u00e9nez, or sweet oloroso sherry<br> 100ml sherry vinegar<br> 100g raisins<br> </p> <p>Season the pork well with salt and pepper. Place a large saucepan over a medium heat and add the olive oil. When hot, lower the pork into the pan and seal until just golden brown on all sides and both ends. Remove the pork and set aside briefly. Still over a medium heat, add the butter and, when it foams, the onion with a pinch of salt, and fry for 10 minutes until sweet, stirring occasionally. Pour off any excess oil, then add the thyme, bay leaves, sherry, sherry vinegar and raisins, and turn the heat to low. Return the pork to the pan, cover with baking paper or tin foil and put the lid on. Cook slowly for 1-1.5 hours or until the meat is just cooked through but still juicy, turning occasionally, so it cooks evenly. To determine whether the pork is cooked, gently push a sharp knife or metal skewer into the centre of the meat. Count to 10 and pull out. Touch the area above your top lip gently with the end of the skewer. If it is hot, the meat is cooked. A meat probe will give you a more accurate reading: as long as it registers 60-65C, the meat is cooked through but still juicy. </p> <p>If using belly pork, double the cooking time, or cook until it is tender. Make sure the juices do not simmer dry. Just add a little water from time to time. </p> <p>Let the pork rest for 10 minutes, covered loosely with foil, before slicing. Turn the heat under the sauce to high and reduce it for 5 minutes, until it is still runny but delicious. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning. We serve this with mashed potato and braised spinach. </p> <p><strong>Barley bread</strong><br> </p> <p>As we were leaving Tangiers on our camper van trip, we bought a couple of breads on the street to eat for breakfast. One was flaky and oily, flavoured with onion and a little tomato; the other was a dense bread made from cracked barley. This bread felt primitive and ancient - more like polenta than bread. We like it lightly grilled and eaten with butter and other accompaniments. Serves 4. </p> <p>140g pearl barley<br> 1.6 litres water<br> 1 tsp fine sea salt<br> Olive oil, for grilling or frying<br> </p> <p>Combine the barley, water and salt in a medium to large saucepan and bring to a good simmer. Stir from time to time with a spoon to stop it sticking on the bottom, and cook for about 1 hour, until the total volume has reduced by half. Take care at the end of cooking, as the mixture may bubble like hot lava and could burn you. Use an electric hand-held blender or food processor to roughly pur\u00e9e half the barley, return to the pan and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove from the heat and spread out on an oiled plate or baking dish so that the mixture is about 2-3cm thick. Leave until completely cold, then cut into wedges. Drizzle both sides with a little olive oil and grill on a hot griddle or barbecue until crisp and slightly charred on both sides. If frying, place a frying pan over a high heat and add olive oil to a depth of 1-2mm. Cook crust-side down for 3-5 minutes until browned and crisp, then turn to cook the other side for just a minute or two to warm through. </p> <p>Serve with fresh cheese, cooked Moroccan salads, or yogurt seasoned with garlic and ground cumin. Alongside this, offer cucumber, carrot and radish crudit\u00e9s, mixed olives and generous sprigs of fresh herbs (mint, flat-leaf parsley and tarragon). </p> <p><strong>Dates with coffee</strong><br> </p> <p>The classic Arab flavours of coffee and cardamom go particularly well with dates. Although this dessert takes a matter of minutes to put together, it is best made at least one day before needed to allow the dates to soak up the coffee. Serves 4. </p> <p>500ml strong black coffee (espresso strength)<br> 1 tsp caster sugar<br> 20 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed<br> 1 cinnamon stick, broken in half<br> 200-250g Greek yogurt<br> </p> <p>Stone the dates carefully to keep their shape, and place in a bowl. Heat the coffee with the sugar and cardamom until just before it begins to boil, then pour over the dates. Leave to infuse with the cinnamon in the fridge overnight or for up to 2 days. Serve chilled with yogurt </p> <p>\u00a9 Samantha and Samuel Clark, 2004. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Extracted from Casa Moro by Sam and Sam Clark, published by Ebury Press on November 4. </p> <p><strong>Next week:</strong> more autumn recipes.

  "<p>A day or two before I met up with Alber Elbaz, creative director of Lanvin, I wandered into the Lanvin shop in Paris to have a preparatory poke around and found Elbaz very busy with somebody else. With American Vogue, in fact, the glossiest of the glossies. They are always easy to spot, those American Vogue people, all dressed up in their regulation designer finery, while Elbaz - small and round as a mole - stood modestly in the background, bowtie skewwhiff and trouser legs rolled up two inches too high, Littlest Hobo-style. In short, he looked every part the humble tailor. When the model appeared from the dressing room, swan-like in a satin gown made by Elbaz himself, the Americans went into absolutely fabulous ecstasies and the model proudly swished her body this way and that. The only person who didn't look happy was Elbaz. In fact, he looked congenitally incapable of enjoying the moment. \"Perhaps she should wear a necklace?\" he timidly suggested, accessory in hand, apparently convinced the dress was insufficient. \"No!\" barked the man from Vogue. \"She's perfect - it's all perfect!\" \"Yes, yes,\" conceded Elbaz, stepping back again, wringing his hands uncertainly.</p> <p>Elbaz is a bit of a rarity in the fashion industry. He is Jewish, which is common enough, but raised in Tel Aviv, which is not exactly a hotbed of fashion designers. \"But it makes you dream because there is nothing there,\" Elbaz says. Then, smiling sentimentally at the prettiness of the idea, he adds, \"I come from the Land of Dreams!\" He has been feted by the fashion elite for two years now since his arrival at Lanvin, yet he hovers on the brink of painful self-deprecation. He makes frequent despairing references to his weight, and even more to his love of food - and don't even get him started on what he thinks of his designs: \"Oh gawwwwwwd, no!\" He eschews cocktails and dinner parties in favour of \"just going home, cooking and watching something stupid on TV - why would I want to take four hours over dinner to talk about the weather? I can look out the window and see the weather in three seconds!\"</p> <p>The fashion press, delighted by this novel creature, has described him variously as \"Billy Bunter\", \"Mr Pickwick\" and \"a fuzzy koala\", and Lanvin has cannily taken advantage of its star's unexpected physical appeal. In the windows of the shop in Paris there are lifesize photos of 42-year-old Elbaz clowning in front of the usual sylphlike mannequins - in the rarefied French fashion world, this is an uncommon display of age before beauty.</p> <p>How did this Israeli chap, who has never airkissed in his life but whose cheeks beg for a fond pinching, become the man in such fashionable demand? It's simple: he likes women, a trait that sometimes seems a lot rarer among male fashion designers than it should be. \"I love women and I'm not here to make them look like tarts or try to make myself look very original,\" he says solemnly. \"My clothes are about comfort, simplicity and not stealing attention from the face. If you change a woman's look, you change her persona. I am here to make her look and feel good about herself.\"</p> <p>Elbaz's dresses skim, as opposed to cling; his trousers are wide-legged and low-waisted; his shoes are daintily round-toed instead of cripplingly pointed. Of course, this being the world of French fashion, Elbaz's women are a decidedly elegant bunch: Kristin Scott Thomas, Julianne Moore and Catherine Deneuve are fans - not exactly Pauline-Fowler-dahn-the-chippy types. But nor are they 26-year-olds with lips full of collagen and a dietician on speed dial, and, as a fanbase, they convey Elbaz's appeal to intelligent, adult women who want to look stylish, not overstyled.</p> <p>For his first Lanvin collection, he made elegant woollen suits, their edges gently frayed, woven through with tiny sequins, accessorised only with a pair of battered ballet pumps. The next season, sweet little black dresses were bedecked with gems and bows. The fashion press quickly fell in love with this image of sweet gentility and Lanvin, a label that had been pretty much forgotten, has become one of the highlights of Paris fashion week. This season, the collection is a little more grown-up: long, belted coats with rippling lapels; gem-coloured satin shifts that slip sexily over the body; and round-toed tweed stilettos speckled with crystals that have already accrued waiting lists despite the inevitably hefty price tags.</p> <p>That such a disarmingly gentle man should be so lauded is nice enough; that it should come to him after a career of some truly appalling luck makes the tale even sweeter. He has been bumped from house to house with greater rapidity than a character on EastEnders: after an early start \"making mother-of-the-bride dresses\" in his 20s in New York, he worked at Geoffrey Beene and Guy Laroche before being handpicked by Yves Saint Laurent to be his successor. This sudden shove to centre stage came to a jarring end two years later in 2000 when the Gucci group bought the label and Tom Ford sat himself in the creative director seat. Elbaz remains tactful about this unhappy period: \"It's not that I'm trying to be Switzerland here, but if you ask me about Tom Ford I will say only positive things. And anyway, I always assume that people won't want me tomorrow.\" The only hint of a dig is when he later refers to how he has \"never destroyed the past, wherever I've worked, because I always think I'm worse than everyone\", which sounds to me like a nibble at Ford's dramatic modernised revamp of YSL.</p> <p>But it's one thing to try to protect oneself by always imagining the worst and quite another for those premonitions to come true. After being so publicly sacked, he fled Paris, humiliated, certain that he would never work again and \"that no one would want to talk to me again. I thought no one would take my calls.\" So he went travelling to \"very unfashionable places\" and continued to sketch, as he had done since he was a child. He thought briefly about becoming a family doctor (\"I hate lawyers, but I love doctors because they make people feel good\") but decided he was too old and, really, returning to fashion was the only sensible thing to do. So after a brief, and reportedly miserable, time designing for Krizia in Italy, he was asked to meet Lanvin. His chubby cheeks widen out and turn a clown-like rosy hue at the memory of when he was rescued from fashion ignominy. \"It was fabulous!\" he beams.</p> <p>These days, he lives contentedly and quietly in Paris. He works from nine until nine, then spends his evenings reading at home or visiting friends \"who no longer listen to me at all when I tell them how I think everyone will soon hate me\", he says with mock annoyance. After all, \"sometimes there's nothing wrong with a little modesty\", he says, with a smile that has the beginnings of a hint of confidence.</p>",
  "<p>OK, here's Andre 3000, so let's go head-to-toe. On his head is a Panama. Covering his top half, a seersucker waistcoat buttoned tight over a white polo shirt. Resting on his arm is a folded cardigan. It's 9.12am. Ain't life grand? Mr 3000 is launching his clothing line this time next year, but wants to do it right. So the magazine where I work is hosting a breakfast to introduce him to all the menswear people in London. It's a get-the-feel-of-the-industry thing - he wants his clothes to be clothes, rather than some afterthought product with his name on it. Sounds promising, doesn't it? </p> <p>A few days later, and we're in NYC for the last leg of the men's collections for spring/summer 05, which consolidate what we know already: blazers with patch pockets, fine-knit polo shirts, gold buttons on white double-breasted (if you dare). What's fresh in NYC is the scene: at Hilfiger, I'm sitting directly behind Mr Diddy, who was meant to be next to Jessica Simpson's husband Nick (this potential meeting of giant minds causes us great excitement). Mr Simpson is a gentleman, though, and when Mr Diddy's mother shows up, he budges down to make room. </p> <p>Opposite sits Mrs J-Lo. Momma Diddy runs over and chats with her ex-future daughter-in-law. Through the whole show, Mrs Lo's eyes are on Mr Diddy. It's all too much. Oh yeah, I write about menswear. Hottest news in shoes is a new collaboration between Vans and Marc Jacobs (trims and cloth in hot candy colours), while there are new steps in the partnership of Converse with John Varvatos: this time, they've done slip-ons where the tongue is sewn up so they are laceless. That's the season over, isn't it? Isn't it?</p>",
  "American forces launched an offensive to seize back control of the Iraqi town of Samarra yesterday, claiming to have killed almost 100 insurgents and captured more than 30 in several hours of bombing raids and street fighting. <p>US forces also carried out air and ground strikes last night deep into the Sadr City slum in east Baghdad, while jets mounted another raid on the rebel city of Falluja, killing at least three civilians. </p> <p>US forces and the Iraqi government have vowed to wrest back control of insurgent parts of Iraq before the national elections due in January. </p> <p>In the Samarra assault, jet fighters began a series of strikes coordinated with artillery barrages on targets in the city, about 60 miles north of Baghdad. The US military said a force of 5,000, including 2,000 Iraqi soldiers, moved into the city centre. A Turkish hostage who had been working for a building company was freed during the assault. </p> <p>A hospital doctor in Samarra said at least 80 bodies had been brought in, but it was unclear how many were fighters. Another said at least five children, 11 women and seven elderly men had died. </p> <p>US and Iraqi forces blocked the roads into the city last night to prevent insurgents moving in and out, said Major Neal O'Brien, a US military spokesman. </p> <p>Samarra, which has a Sunni population with a Shia minority, has been dominated by insurgents and too dangerous for the US forces to enter for months. It sits in the centre of the Sunni heartland near other violent towns such as Falluja and Ramadi. </p> <p>The strikes on Sadr City, meanwhile, followed clashes earlier in the day in the slum, another problem area and a Shia militia stronghold in the eastern suburbs of Baghdad. Doctors said 12 Iraqis were killed and 11 wounded. </p> <p>Last month US commanders claimed they had secured Samarra sufficiently to restore police patrols and revive the local council. </p> <p>Addressing the US Congress last week, Ayad Allawi, the interim Iraqi prime minister, spoke of a new peace in Samarra, hailing it as a sign of political progress. </p> <p>His words were woefully optimistic and, in reality, insurgents still held sway. Earlier this week, armed fighters from the Tawhid and Jihad militant group led by the Jordanian, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, drove brazenly through the city streets, ordering motorists to give up music tapes in return for cassettes of Quranic readings. </p> <p>Yesterday the US 1st Infantry Division said it was fighting to restore order there. \"In response to repeated and unprovoked attacks by anti-Iraqi forces, Iraqi security forces and multinational forces secured the government and police buildings in Samarra early in the morning,\" the army statement said. </p> <p>It added: \"Unimpeded access throughout the city for Iraqi security forces and multinational forces is non-negotiable.\" </p> <p>The army claimed to have killed 94 insurgents and said one American soldier had died and four had been wounded. </p> <p>Iraqi commandos had taken over Samarra's Golden mosque and arrested 25 rebels inside it, said US officials. By midday, Iraq's interior ministry said, the police were back in control of the centre and some surrounding areas. </p> <p>Electricity and water were cut off as tanks pushed through the streets and came under fire from rocket-propelled grenades and rifles. Roads leading to the city were blocked by tanks, and a 12-hour nighttime curfew was imposed. </p> <p>Several houses and many vehicles were destroyed in the operation. \"We are terrified by the violent approach used by the Americans to subdue the city,\" Mahmoud Saleh, 33, a civil servant, told Associated Press. </p> <p>\"My wife and children are scared to death and they have not been able to sleep since last night. I hope the fighting ends as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>Samarra is one of several insurgent-held areas which the US and the Iraqi government have vowed to retake before the January elections. </p> <p>By far their toughest battle will be in Falluja, where the US marines fought for three weeks in April, killing at least 600 Iraqis and provoking huge protests throughout the country. Since then, the many Islamic militant groups in Falluja have gone from strength to strength.</p>",
  "Al-Qaida's number two, Ayman al-Zawahri, has urged Muslims to mount worldwide resistance to \"crusader America\" and its western allies, in a purported audio recording broadcast by al-Jazeera television yesterday <p>\"Let us start resisting now ... We can't wait or we will be eaten up, country by country,\" he said. </p> <p>\"People of knowledge and experience should organise their efforts and form a leadership for the resistance to combat the crusaders.\" </p> <p>He gave a long list of American allies to be targeted, including Britain, Australia, Poland, South Korea and Japan. It was not possible to verify the tape independently, but the voice sounded similar to that on earlier messages. </p> <p>The inflammatory appeal coincided with the suicide bombing of a Shia mosque in Pakistan which killed at least 25 people and wounded dozens - a sectarian attack which officials said might also have had al-Qaida links. </p> <p>More than 1,000 people were in the mosque in Sialkot, 100 miles south-east of Islamabad, when a man rushed in and detonated a briefcase bomb. </p> <p>Twelve people died instantly and the blast left a 2ft deep crater. </p> <p>A Shia cleric, Allama Saeed Hasan, saw blood on the ceil ing and walls. \"People were shouting and screaming ... Enemies of Islam and Pakistan are responsible for this,\" he told Reuters news agency. </p> <p>More than 50 wounded victims were taken to hospital, where several more died. The death toll was expected to rise. </p> <p>No group claimed responsibility, but Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Pakistan's information minister, said the attack could have been in retaliation for last weekend's killing of a Sunni militant leader, Amjad Hussain Farooqi, who had high-level al-Qaida links. </p> <p>He died in a gun battle after being cornered by the security forces at a house in Sind province. </p> <p>Mr Farooqi was believed to have played a key role in two attempts to assassinate President Pervez Musharraf and the murder of the American journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002. </p> <p>Other Sunni extremists may have carried out yesterday's bombing to avenge his death, Sheikh Ahmed said. </p> <p>The bombing caused a violent reaction in Sialkot, and riot police were sent to quell a stone-throwing mob which set fire to police vehicles and chanted slogans against the government. </p> <p>Sunnis comprise about 70% of Pakistan's population, Shias 20%.</p>",
  "<p>Rafael Ben\u00edtez and Jose Mourinho have never met though their first t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate appears destined to be combustive. The Spaniard has tired of Liverpool's supine approach. \"We need to be more aggressive,\" he said, intent upon unearthing a mean streak. </p> <p>Given Mourinho's livid reaction when Tottenham Hotspur metaphorically \"parked a bus\" in front of their goal recently, the Portuguese is presumably already rehearsing his post-match flap of moral outrage. </p> <p>Where they might have first become acquainted in sun-drenched Monaco at the European Super Cup in August, last season's Uefa Cup and Champions League winning managers meet instead at Stamford Bridge tomorrow with their respective starts in English football under fierce scrutiny. At Chelsea, Russian money has bought Mourinho British spirit with an unbeaten start suggesting immediate dividends. On Merseyside, Ben\u00edtez is having to coax out the required state of mind; his is a work in progress. </p> <p>He has preached patience yet something snapped this week. In the steamy heat of Piraeus, Liverpool were bullied into submission by Olympiakos, brushed aside by a Greek side who harried and hassled effectively around the creative hub provided by Rivaldo. Benitez was apoplectic as his own free-spirited players went unprotected and were systematically snuffed out. The hosts won with a set-piece which was dubiously conceded and abysmally defended, and Liverpool departed beaten and bruised. </p> <p>That, the Spaniard has decreed, must not happen again. \"I was disappointed to watch what happened, but not shocked,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"We didn't keep the ball, we didn't control the game and we lacked the right mentality. If you have players who play well with the ball and players who are aggressive when they are without the ball, then you have a team. But a lot depends upon the characteristics of a side. </p> <p>\"If a player has a good, giving mentality, it can be difficult for him to become a 'hard' person in the next minute. But that's what we need. I mean just aggressive, not violent. Perhaps we lack a leader with Steven Gerrard injured, but if you don't have that in one individual you need to find a leader in the group - work as a team and the whole side can be a leader.\" </p> <p>There were times when Liverpool appeared rudderless in Greece, their inability to grasp the zonal marking system used to defend set-plays so successfully by Ben\u00edtez at Valencia offering opponents real hope. Chelsea thrive at free-kicks and John Terry, Ricardo Carvalho and Didier Drogba loom large tomorrow, yet to concentrate solely on the merits of Ben\u00edtez's preferred tactics may be missing the point. Liverpool need steel regardless of whether they man-mark or pick up space. </p> <p>In the Mestalla, Benitez had Roberto Ayala, David Albelda and Amedeo Carboni whose snapping allowed Pablo Aimar or Ruben Baraja to revel. Even after a handful of training sessions on Merseyside, the Spaniard had clocked why this Liverpool side had finished 30 points shy of Arsenal last term. </p> <p>Mourinho, and Drogba in particular, may wince at the thought. The Ivorian was crunched early by Ayala in last season's Uefa Cup final and subsequently drifted out of the match. It will be up to Jamie Carragher or Sami Hyypia to maintain that tradition though Drogba is quickly finding his feet in the Premiership. As is his manager. </p> <p>\"I think, even with some influence from foreign managers, coaches and players, it is the British football and mentality that is always dominant here,\" said Mourinho, whose side has been nothing if not gritty with two goals conceded in his nine games in charge. \"These are the first months of Rafael's life in England and he has to learn, like me. </p> <p>\"Set-plays are a very specific part of the game; sometimes it's a question of the defence. I think zonal defence in set-plays has good and bad things. Every tactical system - even ours - has weak points. I know how Rafa works, the style of football he plays and the style in which his side defends. He is a fantastic manager who did great work in Valencia.\" </p> <p>That much is true but, while the two continental coaches' achievements in recent years may compare as staggering, Roman Abramovich's bottomless pockets have ensured that Mourinho has had the means to impose his own character upon his squad since arriving in England. \"It's easier if you've got the money to go into the market,\" added Ben\u00edtez. \"Imagine if you want to buy a jacket. If you have \u00a31,000 you can buy a good jacket.

  "<p>Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings against Ferencvaros after fans of the Budapest club threw missiles and shouted racist abuse during Thursday's Uefa Cup first round second-leg victory against Millwall. </p> <p>A spokesman for European football's governing body indicated that there will be no formal hearing. Instead a disciplinary panel will deal with the case on Thursday. A decision on possible punishments, which could include a fine or stadium closure, will be announced the same day. </p> <p>It is not the first time that Ferencvaros have failed to control their supporters. The club was recently fined for crowd trouble at a Champions League qualifier and their matches against their local rivals Ujpest are regularly marred by violence. </p> <p>The British Embassy in Budapest reported that two Millwall supporters who were stabbed in disturbances before the match are in a stable condition. Millwall's chairman Theo Paphitis, who has visited the two men in hospital, said he would make his feelings known to Uefa. </p> <p>\"I have serious concerns about a number of issues surrounding this tie, including the provocation our supporters were subjected to inside the ground,\" he said. \"Missiles were being thrown at us, our players were subjected to racial abuse and there was a lack of security where it was needed.\" </p> <p>Two of the nine Britons arrested following the skirmishes were yesterday given suspended sentences and expelled from the country after being found guilty of disorderly conduct and criminal damage. </p> <p>Trouble began before the game when rival supporters hurled seats at each other in Budapest's city centre. There were also reports of skirmishes at two underground stations close to the Ulloi Ut Stadium, forcing armed police to intervene. </p> <p>Banik Ostrava have also been charged by Uefa after inadequate segregation led to fighting in the stands during their 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough.</p>",
  "<p>Dermot Weld, the Irish trainer who has won important races worldwide, can add Europe's most prestigious prize to his cv with Grey Swallow at Longchamp tomorrow. </p> <p>The Irish Derby winner was supplemented for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at a cost of \u20ac60,000 (\u00a342,000), a decision Weld would not have taken lightly. </p> <p>The colt has clearly bounced back from his latest run, a good fourth in the Irish Champion Stakes, which left Grey Swallow \"flat\" for a few days. </p> <p>The distance of the Champion, 1 miles, is short of Grey Swallow's best. He is a proper 12-furlong horse, as he showed when beating North Light, the Epsom Derby winner, Tycoon and Rule Of Law, the subsequent St Leger winner, in a strong Irish Derby. </p> <p>North Light returned sore from his Curragh exertions and has not run since. He is reported in excellent form on the Newmarket gallops, and if anyone can send out an Arc winner after such a preparation, it is Sir Michael Stoute. </p> <p>However, Stoute, who has yet to win the Arc, has clearly faced a race against time to get North Light ready. </p> <p>Andre Fabre, by contrast, has given Valixir the classic preparation and he also runs Cherry Mix in a bid to win the race for an amazing sixth time. </p> <p>Valixir finished strongly to pip Prospect Park and Bago in the Prix Niel, a proven Arc trial, at Longchamp last month, but it seems Fabre does not rate Valixir on a par with some of his previous Arc winners. </p> <p>\"Valixir has a good chance, but there is no margin with him,\" said the trainer. \"He will have come on a little but I am worried about Valixir getting the trip in a strongly-run race.\" </p> <p>Warrsan, Mamool and Japanese raider Tap Dance City are the most interesting among the older horses. But their representation looks weaker than usual and three-year-olds can rule the roost, with <strong> Grey Swallow (4.30)</strong> the pick. </p> <p>A three-year-old can also have the final say in today's domestic highlight, the totesport Cambridgeshire Handicap at Newmarket, where <strong> Pedrillo (3.55)</strong> has the makings of another well-worked coup by master trainer Sir Mark Prescott. </p> <p>Already successful in this race on three occasions, Prescott resisted running Pedrillo this season until the weights for the nine-furlong prize were published. An eye-catching third at Kempton was followed by a five-lengths win at Hamilton by Pedrillo, who looks to have got in lightly. </p> <p>Only his comparative inexperience is off-putting, and at 5-1 Pedrillo is short enough. But the majority of his rivals are exposed handicappers, and Pedrillo is the one runner with the potential to be a lot better than his current mark. </p> <p>Provided the rain stays away, the Sun Chariot Stakes should provide a fascinating clash between Attraction and <strong> Chic (3.15)</strong>. </p> <p>Judging by her defeat of Nayyir, who had previously run Soviet Song close, at Goodwood, Chic should have the edge over her year younger rival. </p> <p><strong> Belly Dancer (2.00) </strong> is on a fair mark in the fillies' nursery, and the return to seven furlongs in the Oh So Sharp Stakes will suit <strong> Umniya (2.35)</strong>. </p> <p>Henry Candy's unbeaten colt, <strong> Caesar Beware (2.55)</strong>, is an exceptional two-year-old and should net another valuable prize at Redcar provided another race on fast ground is not one too many. </p> <p>With the Jeremy Noseda stable in good form, <strong> Twilight Blues (3.25) </strong> should be hard to beat in the Listed race there. A regular competitor at Group level, Twilight Blues won over this seven furlongs trip as a three-year-old. </p> <p>A 6lb penalty is unlikely to be enough to stop <strong> Newcorp Lad (1.45) </strong> from following up his all-the-way five lengths win at Newcastle on Wednesday. </p> <p><strong> Border Tale (3.30)</strong>, having his first run for in-form trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies, can go close in the Free Handicap Hurdle at Chepstow. He ran creditably in last season's Triumph Hurdle, and enjoys a huge pull in the weights with the runner-up, Chief Yeoman. </p> <p>Peter Bowen is another trainer going great guns and his useful French import, <strong> Jacquemart Colombe (3.00)</strong>, looks a chaser to follow.</p>",
  "<p>Does anyone remember the last time Hollywood released a movie that made Mexico seem like an attractive travel destination? Classics like Viva Zapata! and The Power And The Glory painted haunting images of this troubled nation as an impoverished hellhole; heart-rending tales like El Norte certainly didn't do much for the Mexican tourism business; 10 launched Bo Derek's gratuitous career and more recent offerings like Traffic make the country seem like the very last place you'd want to spend the weekend. And that's without even mentioning Sergio Leone's south-of-the-border shoot-'em-ups or Sam Peckinpah's peerless gore-fest The Wild Bunch, which portrayed old Mexico as a vicious, gladiatorial arena where you shot first, asked questions later, and then did some more shooting.</p> <p>These musings on the subject are prompted by the release of Tony Scott's bloodcurdling Man On Fire, which once again portrays America's neighbour to the south as a war zone dominated by murderous drug lords, corrupt policemen and crooked politicians. The film stars Denzel Washington as John Creasey, a semi-retired professional assassin, formerly in the employ of the United States government, who drifts south of the border in a futile attempt to get his life back on track. Hooking up with his old comrade-in-arms Christopher Walken, Washington half-heartedly takes a job as a private bodyguard for the supernaturally cute Dakota Fanning (I Am Sam), whose wealthy parents are terrified that she might be kidnapped and held for an enormous ransom.</p> <p>Tot and hit man immediately form an unlikely friendship. Washington teaches the little cutie competitive aquatics: she teaches him how to put down the whiskey flask long enough to crack a smile. But when the lovable tyke is abducted, Washington reverts to form and sets out on a crusade to wipe out every thug, crook, stool pigeon, rat, child molester, lowlife and dirty cop in the Mexico City metropolitan area.</p> <p>In the words of Walken, who has recently replaced John Malkovich as the industry's most beloved ham: \"Creasey is an artist. His canvas is death. And he is about to paint his masterpiece.\"</p> <p>Man On Fire is a reasonably effective action film, and Washington delivers yet another of his taut, unnerving performances, coming off here as a sort of African-American Clint Eastwood, a loner who lets his guns do the talking.</p> <p>But it doesn't make Mexico City seem like a particularly enticing locale. This got me to thinking about motion pictures that depicted certain cities and countries in such an electrifyingly repugnant fashion that I made a decision to scratch them off my list of desirable destinations forever.</p> <p>Midnight Express didn't do much for the Turkish tourism business, nor did Costa-Gavras's Missing help raise the tourist profile of Chile during the troublesome Pinochet years. To this list can be added City Of God (Brazil), The Quiet American (Vietnam), Deliverance (rural Georgia), The Killing Fields (Cambodia), Rambo III (Afghanistan), and In The Name Of The Father (Northern Ireland), to name but a few.</p> <p>Yet motion pictures need not be spectacularly violent and grim to make them seem unattractive to aspiring globetrotters. I personally have never had any great urge to visit Japan and, after I saw Lost In Translation, I had even less. Whether or not Sofia Coppola's charming little film about a washed-up actor marooned in Tokyo was fair to the people of Japan is open to debate, but with its spellbinding images of idiotic television personalities, asinine directors, addled youths and obsequious functionaries, Lost In Translation conveyed one and only one message to westerners: don't go there. You won't be able to sleep. You won't be able to communicate. And if you're not careful, you'll wind up in bed with a washed-out nightclub chantoosey whose bring-down-the-house number is the innocuous yet entirely revolting Midnight At The Oasis.</p> <p>Without a doubt, there is something unfair about the way the movie industry romanticises certain cities and slanders others. Photogenic cities like Paris and Rome are invariably the setting for heartwarming bagatelles like Roman Holiday and Amelie, whereas Saigon, Miami and Marseilles always seem like a good place to get your throat slit. One is thus left to ponder whether Sleepless In Asuncion or Blame It On Gdansk could have bolstered the images of those blighted metropolises, or whether a Notting Hill set in Stoke or Nottingham could have spiffed up the escutcheons of those much-maligned cities. Probably not: there is nothing in The Full Monty that would make anyone want to visit Sheffield, nothing in Flashdance that would make Pittsburgh seem more appealing, nothing in Billy Elliot that would make a blighted northern England seem like a more attractive tourist destination. Dreary motion pictures set in Belfast have had no positive effect on the economy or image of that troubled city.</p> <p>Years ago I met a man who headed an organisation called the Oklahoma State Film Commission. It was his job to fly out to Los Angeles every few weeks and try to persuade the powers-that-be to make more movies in one of America's least majestic, least photogenic states. It was not an easy task. The problem was, the last major motion picture to get made in Oklahoma was Twister, and, in all likelihood, the next one would be Twister II.</p> <p>It is a sad but undeniable fact that the public has preconceived notions about certain localities - Mexico dangerous, Oklahoma arid, rural America creepy, English Canada boring - that are difficult to dislodge. No one in his right mind is going to set a comedy in El Salvador or a coming-of-age tale in the Chechen republic. No one is going to try to make Munich seem like it's as much fun as Berlin, or Rotterdam the Dutch equivalent of Hong Kong. The cards have been dealt, and the hands must be played.</p> <p>Sometimes, however, the logic underlying of these decisions backfires. Last year, Touchstone released a predictable chick flick called Under The Tuscan Sun, based on the thunderously corny book of the same name. The movie starred Diane Lane, armed to the teeth with her arsenal of hackneyed facial expressions, as a middle-aged divorcee who treks to colourful Tuscany to get her life back together. Ostensibly, this was a movie designed to induce even more Americans to visit sunny Tuscany, as if 50 million yuppie Yanks who trek to Italy each spring in search of the perfect balsamic vinegar weren't enough. But after 113 minutes of canny workmen, feisty matriarchs, doe-eyed virgins and predatory Latin metrosexuals, I quickly decided that I'd be better off in Cardiff, Algiers or Newark, New Jersey. If Italians are as hokey and stereotypical as they are here I'm never going to Italy. All things considered, I'd rather be in Philadelphia. In fact, I'd rather be in Mexico City.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Man On Fire is out on Friday</p>",
  "<p><strong>Telephone:</strong> 020-7796 0600<br><strong>Address:</strong> 57 West Smithfield, London EC1<br></p> <p>I was supposed to be at Club Gascon in London by 8pm, but was running late due to an incident with security staff at Manchester airport. Having failed to find a bomb in the soles of my shoes or in my navel, they'd delightedly confiscated a miniature corkscrew from my keyring, whereupon I politely pointed out that they were nevertheless still prepared to let me get on board armed with a bottle of my favourite Ch\u00e2teau Musar, a potentially lethal weapon (and Middle Eastern to boot), which I could smash in half in the aircraft's lavatory before hacking off the pilot's head and seizing control of the plane. Authority seldom responds well to sarcasm, and they kept me waiting until the next flight, but then I always seem to get delayed at airports. I put it down to all the offal I eat doing this job. It must be my iron-rich blood that sets off the alarms. </p> <p>It's the job of a good ma\u00eetre d' to spot a late diner in distress and calm things down. So alarm bells started ringing the moment I reached the restaurant because, having fought my way inside (past potential diners spilling out into the street), I encountered no welcome from anyone, let alone the ma\u00eetre d'. When my existence was eventually acknowledged by a staff member, it was done so grudgingly, and when I asked to be moved from the table he'd seated me at (because an adjacent diner in the throes of pulmonary convulsions was giving a one-man recital of Great Expectorations), he curtly told me, \"I don't take orders, somebody else does.\" </p> <p>\"Are you my waiter?\" </p> <p>\"Yes.\" </p> <p>\"May I move from this table?\" </p> <p>\"No.\" </p> <p>So far, I was enjoying my interaction with this club about as much as the average seal pup does. </p> <p>Twenty minutes later, nothing had arrived, nor been offered. Even a first-year catering student knows to put bread, water or a glass of wine on the table, but not here. But that did at least afford me plenty of time to survey the clientele. The assorted braying pinstripes, tourists and gastronomic neophytes had little in common with each other, or with me, so this certainly wasn't a club (in the sense of \"an association of persons of like sympathies\"), but was it a taste of Gascony? Well, up to a point. The south-western French province has a tradition of hearty peasant food, of tripe, eels and maize-fed chicken; but what I encountered here (served on plates that resembled slabs of slate from a Lake District tourist bibelot shop) was more paltry than poultry, and much of it was portentous, overly fussy coq. Indeed, the thirtysomething miniature tapas-style dishes on offer didn't constitute a menu so much as a symposium, so eclectic that it was well-nigh impossible to select a half dozen that amounted to a coherent order. </p> <p>Eventually, some dishes did arrive, and now is perhaps the time to mention that the wife in the couple I was eating with takes no prisoners (she once told Harold Pinter that \"The Caretaker is a bloody boring name for a play\"). She hated the grandiloquent surroundings and demeanour, disapproved of the lilliputian portions (costing on average a tenner apiece), and pronounced the kebab of farthing-sized queen scallops and snails with juicy aubergine \"vile ... it tastes of less than nothing\". The old-fashioned cassoulet Toulousain that I tried was better, though short on Toulouse sausage (which, classically, should constitute one-third of the dish), and where was the golden crust? As for the cappuccino of black pudding, lobster and asparagus, that underwhelmed us all, and although the casserole of girolles, green beans and fresh almonds worked well, when do those small but intensely flavoured mushrooms ever fail? </p> <p>Above all, Gascony is noted for foie gras, but does chef Pascal Aussignac have to use it so incontinently (it featured in at least eight dishes)? The stuff is perfect as it is, so don't ruin it with fashion-victim combinations such as foie gras popcorn (I kid you not), especially when it's overpowered (and ruined) by cumin seed. As for the sorbets that spasmodically appeared, may I explode the myth that these \"cleanse the palate\"? They don't. First they freeze it, then they gum it up (which here, admittedly, was a mercy). </p> <p>What was it that made me pleased to be here? Absolutely nothing. Nobody seemed concerned about our wellbeing; nobody greeted us, showed anything but the most perfunctory interest in us, or even said goodbye. I'm told that when it opened in the late 90s, this place was wonderful, and doubtless it was. But now it's resting on its laurels, so pleased with itself that it's neglecting the basics that any restaurant should provide. Incredibly, it received a Michelin star in 2002, an award that just reinforces my growing belief in the lack of genuine knowledge that those self-proclaimed arbiters of gastronomic taste really possess (a subject to which I intend to return). </p> <p>Need any further convincing? Well, Salman Rushdie and his wife Padma Lakshmi often eat there, so don't ask for a window seat if they're in. Because if someone shouts out \"duck\", you'll never be sure if it's an urgent instruction, or merely a menu suggestion.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Open:</strong> Lunch, Mon-Fri, 12 noon-2pm; dinner, Mon-Sat, 7-10pm, (10.30pm Fri &amp; Sat)<br><strong>Price:</strong> Small tapas-style dishes ranging from \u00a35.50-\u00a338 each.

  "<p>Some homebuyers could be left high and dry if their mortgage broker is not geared up for new home loan rules coming in at the end of the month, according to a warning issued this week. </p> <p>Not only is October 31 Halloween - this year it's also Mortgage Day. On that date the Financial Services Authority becomes responsible for policing Britain's multi-billion pound mortgage industry. </p> <p>The new regime should mean a better deal for people taking out home loans, but there are bound to be a few glitches while everything beds down - and there will inevitably be some firms that fail to get their act together in time for the big change-over. </p> <p>If you're looking to take out a mortgage this month and are planning to talk to a broker or financial adviser, it's important to make sure the firm you use has the necessary authorisation in place. </p> <p>The worst case scenario is that some broker firms could be forced to cease trading just as many of their customers' mortgage applications are being processed, resulting in people's home loans being delayed or, worse, homebuyers losing their mortgage deals completely. </p> <p>\"The consequences for homebuyers and sellers could be appalling, with many applicants having to start the entire mortgage process again,\" says Richard Brown, chief executive of Moneynet, an online financial research and data website. </p> <p>After Mortgage Day it will be a criminal offence to sell most types of mortgages unless a firm has had the green light from the FSA. Mr Brown is worried that a sizeable number of mortgage brokers will not have the necessary permission in place to trade under the new regime, but the industry's main trade body, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, is keen to dispel such fears, saying: \"We are not expecting this to be a widespread problem.\" </p> <p>It adds that the vast majority of mortgage broker firms do seem to be on track to be authorised in time. But to avoid possible problems, consumers should check that their broker is registered with the Mortgage Code Compliance Board (the body that will regulate mortgages until October 31) and will be authorised to undertake mortgage business under the new rules, before applying for a home loan. </p> <p><strong> Why will this new regulatory regime mean a better deal for borrowers?</strong> For the first time mortgages will be subjected to the same level of scrutiny as personal pensions, unit trusts and other investments. The FSA will be monitoring the behaviour of more than 100 lenders and 7,000 broker and IFA firms. It will be insisting the information companies give people about loans is clear, comparable and comprehensive - and coming down hard on rule-breakers. </p> <p>The new system includes rules on everything from the fees attached to mortgages -they mustn't be \"excessive\" - to the way people who fall behind with their monthly payments are treated. But the biggest difference that people will probably notice is the introduction of something called a \"key facts illustration\", or KFI. </p> <p><strong> What's that then? </strong> When someone applies for a mortgage they will, after answering a number of questions, be handed a KFI. This is a document, probably running to several pages in some cases, that will set out all the key information about the mortgage such as the overall cost of the loan and any fees you have to pay. </p> <p>It will, for example, tell you precisely how much you will be paying back to the lender for every \u00a31 that you're borrowing, and (if relevant) how much your monthly payments would go up by if interest rates were to increase. These KFI factsheets will present the information in a standardised format which should make it easier to compare mortgages from different companies. So after doing the rounds of the banks and building societies on a Saturday morning, you may end up clutching four or five KFI documents and can then compare how the deals stack up against each other. </p> <p><strong> Who's paying for all these changes? Joe Punter I suppose?</strong> The home loans business has estimated that the new regulatory regime will add \u00a3100-plus to the cost of each mortgage sold. </p> <p>The FSA reckons the one-off cost of regulation will be \u00a3136m, plus ongoing costs of \u00a368m a year, and puts the estimated cost to the consumer at \u00a33.90 per month in the first year of a mortgage. </p> <p>However, it adds that many companies are likely to absorb the costs. The Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, says it is competition, not regulation, that dictates pricing in the mortgage market - and this is a fiercely competitive industry. </p> <p><strong> Is it going to be paper overload?</strong> That's what some experts reckon. Some say the KFIs could well run to six pages. And there have been suggestions that the new system will mean longer interviews with advisers, with lots more questions being asked. But, quizzed on this point, the FSA says this is not necessarily the case, with the length of interviews depending on things such as the complexity of your circumstances. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Halifax says that, at the moment, an interview for a mortgage with one of its advisers typically takes about an hour, and is not expected to take any longer post-October 31. </p> <p><strong> Are buy-to-let mortgages covered by the new rules?</strong> No, they are excluded as they are regarded as commercial loans. Not everyone is happy about that. If you buy a house to live in it, the mortgage is regulated, but if you buy the same house to let it out, the mortgage is not regulated, says Jonathan Cornell at home loans broker Hamptons Mortgages. </p> <p>He adds: \"Why should landlords not receive statutory protection on their mortgage?\" He is unhappy about some other aspects of the regime too. The \"overall cost for comparison\" figure on the KFI documents will be an APR (annual percentage rate) figure. </p> <p>But, says Mr Cornell, it's worked out on the basis that a borrower taking out, say, a two-year discount or two-year fixed rate deal then has 23 years on the lender's standard variable rate - hardly representative of many new borrowers who will hop to another deal when the special rate has ended. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Guardian and Observer Guide to Remortgaging, sponsored by Moneyextra, is available free on 0845 300 4519</p>",
  "<p>Centrica, the owner of British Gas, bought the drain cleaning firm Dyno-Rod yesterday in a \u00a357.6m deal that boosted its home services operation. </p> <p>Centrica said the acquisition also gave it access to 14 million households that rely on emergency call-out services in a market worth more than \u00a3500m a year. </p> <p>The deal hands Dyno-Rod's founder, Jim Zockoll, a windfall of \u00a349m and ends speculation that the firm might be listed on the stock market. </p> <p>British Gas has 1.2 million customers with plumbing and drain cover, much of it handed to Dyno-Rod on a contractual basis.

  "<p>It goes without saying that a \u00a33.6m house should earn the descriptions \"grand\" and \"luxurious\", but anyone with any knowledge of interior design - or at the very least those of us who have spent far too long watching House Doctor - would hesitate to call the Blairs' new abode a home. </p> <p>With its haughty ceilings, dour colour scheme and penchant for mahogany, it is stuffy to the point of taxidermical rigidity. This is, in short, a dead house, entirely lacking in exuberance. Impressive staircases it may have, but one senses that it has been some time since anyone slid down those well-waxed banisters. </p> <p>There is something eminently depressing in the over-ruched curtains, festooned and draped to nigh-on bordello proportions, the pristine white coving and complementary mantlepieces prompting thoughts of a Fortnum's royally iced fruitcake rather than good taste. </p> <p>The kitchen too, in all its brass-handled country pine predictability, is overwhelmingly MFI. </p> <p>But the house's most striking feature is arguably the startling array of patterns: floor tiles, wallpaper, curtains. Nothing is untouched. It is a look that aspires to William Morris, but is more reminiscent of the early 1990s, a period in British design history when, seemingly by law, every public house in the land was refurbished with contrasting carpets, drapes and soft furnishings. </p> <p>It could be said that this is interior decoration from a period in which the Blairs feel most at home, an era before both bean-bag living and anti-war protests. An age when practically everyone painted their dining room deep red, and no one whinged about tuition fees. Who could resent their desire to return to such halcyon days? </p> <p>But one might have hoped that Tony and Cherie might have plumped for something a little more bon vivant; something that nodded to Tony's rock 'n' roll past. Something more like Noel Gallagher's former residence, Supernova Heights, for example, Or, at the very least, one of Mr Prescott's new builds.</p>",
  "<p>After months of unrelenting pressure from our children, we've finally decided to give in and let them have the pet cats they so desperately desire. </p> <p>The plan is to get two kittens in time for Christmas and, yes - before you ask - we do appreciate that a cat is for life and not just for Christmas. </p> <p>This gives us pet-owning novices three months to find out how to care for them, get the required litter tray, cat-flap and so on and recruit someone to look after the cats when we go on holiday. All that remains is to source the right kittens - ideally, two short-haired females. </p> <p>And that's the hard bit. Where do you go to buy healthy, well cared-for kittens and what should you expect to pay? I had no idea at first. </p> <p>The local veterinary clinic/pet shop wasn't much help. \"We don't actually source kittens for customers though we sometimes get people advertising kittens on our noticeboard or you could look on the internet,\" the assistant said. </p> <p>Now though, after talking to feline charities, pet insurers, cat clubs and breeders, I'm a bit more clued up. </p> <p>The key thing is to get your animal from a reliable source such as an animal shelter, a friend or a recommended cat breeder so that you know about its background and that it has been looked after. </p> <p>\"You need to know where a kitten has come from, that it is healthy and not inbred and that it has not been taken from its mother too young - ideally, not before nine weeks old,\" says a spokeswoman for Cats Protection, the UK's largest feline charity. </p> <p>A good owner should allow you to visit their home to view the kittens with their mother and the surroundings should be hygienic with clean litter trays and alert, playful kittens. You should always take a new kitten straight to a vet for a full health check. </p> <p>If you are after a pedigree cat, expect to pay anything from \u00a3150 for a good quality \"pet-class\" cat from a reputable breeder and \u00a3250 upwards for an animal of breeding or show quality. Prices vary geographically; those in the south-east are often higher than in the north. </p> <p>A good way to track down a reputable breeder is to contact one of the 147 cat clubs affiliated to the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), the UK's feline equivalent of the Kennel Club and the body responsible for registering pedigree cats. </p> <p>Cat clubs, some of which specialise in particular breeds and others which cover all breeds in a given region, are listed on the GCCF website at <a href=\"http://www.gccfcats.org\">gccfcats.org</a> (tel: 01278-427-575). </p> <p>Their members follow GCCF guidelines in only selling kittens of 13 weeks or more that have been fully innoculated, house trained and registered - all included in the price. </p> <p>The GCCF will advise on the right sort of breeds to suit your family's needs and put you in contact with appropriate clubs who can then supply you with kitten lists or a list of breeders. </p> <p>It advises telephoning some breeders and getting an idea of prices of kittens before fixing visits. Breeders should be happy to show you their kittens without compelling you to buy, but don't expect a breeder to keep a kitten for you indefinitely. You may be expected to pay a non-returnable deposit if the kitten is to be kept for any length of time after it is ready to go to a new home, it says. </p> <p>Neither the GCCF nor animal charities tend to recommend buying kittens from pet shops or through adverts in local papers, primarily because it's hard to be sure about the cat's origin and health. </p> <p>You'll pay far less for a pedigree if you are willing to take on an older cat that needs re-housing, perhaps because their owner is ill or is emigrating. Most cat clubs hold details of pedigrees needing a new home and available to the right new owner (they'll check you out first) for a token donation or free of charge. </p> <p>If you are not bothered about pedigrees and it's a straightforward moggy you want, keep your ear to the ground for news of friends and neighbours who may have a new litter. Whenever possible buy from a source that has been recommended to you by someone whose judgment you trust. </p> <p>Some cat clubs, such as the Coventry &amp; Leicester Cat Club, for example, will put you on to moggies as well as pedigrees from reputable sources. But, for the \u00a310 or \u00a320 you pay for a moggy, don't expect it to be already innoculated and house trained. </p> <p>Adopting an unwanted cat or kitten for free from one of the many feline charity rescue centres around the UK can be an excellent way of getting a pet, because you'll also benefit from the advice and knowledge of experienced and dedicated staff. </p> <p>Animal welfare is the priority of all rescue organisations, and you will first have to undergo a home visit to ensure the animal will fit in to its new environment. There may also be a cost involved, as some charities have animals neutered and even microchipped before they are allowed home to their new owners. </p> <p>You'll find a directory of rescue centres by UK region at <a href=\"http://www.pethealthcare.co.uk\">pethealthcare.co.uk</a>, an online pet information website set up by pet insurer More Than, and a directory of cat charities at <a href=\"http://www.catclub.net\">catclub.net</a> </p> <p>Cat Protection, for example, with 30 shelters and 260 voluntary branches around the country, has thousands of needy cats at any one time awaiting new homes. All animals in the charity's care are neutered (if six months old or over), de-flead, de-wormed and given a clean bill of health prior to re-homing. </p> <p>To adopt a cat, contact your nearest branch or shelter - details on <a href=\"http://www.cats.org.uk\">cats.org.uk</a> or call 08702-099-099. Once a representative has visited you at home to ensure the right cat is matched with the right home, you can choose your new pet. If you are adopting a kitten, you must sign an agreement to have it neutered at the appropriate time. </p> <p>There's no fee as such when you adopt an animal from Cats Protection, but a donation of at least \u00a320 is appreciated, given that each cat costs the charity more than \u00a3150 to care for before it is ready for rehoming. </p> <p><strong>Can you afford a kitten?</strong></p> <p>As well as the price of buying a cat in the first place, there are other expenses to take into account when deciding if you can afford to take on a kitten: </p> <p><strong>First vaccination and booster vaccination</strong> \u00a360-\u00a380 </p> <p><strong> Neutering male cat </strong> \u00a330-\u00a335 </p> <p><strong> Spaying female cat </strong> \u00a345-\u00a355 </p> <p><strong> Litter tray and other essentials approx \u00a330 </strong></p> <p><strong> Cat food and litter (per month)</strong> \u00a315-\u00a320 </p> <p><strong> Routine veterinary care (per year) approx </strong> \u00a325 </p> <p><strong> Pet insurance (per year) </strong> approx \u00a3100 </p> <p><strong> Catteries for when you go away (per day)</strong> approx \u00a36 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Figures from Cats Protection</p>",
  "<p>Back in early 2000, it seemed that every billboard was plastered with adverts promoting individual savings accounts (Isas). The Saturday newspapers groaned with inch-thick Isa supplements telling readers the tax-free pleasures (and in a few cases the pitfalls) of investing in these products. </p> <p>The public, still in the glow of the dotcom boom, responded enthusiastically. In just one month, March 2000, an astonishing \u00a32.3bn flowed into the coffers of the investment management groups, mostly from small savers. The next month saw another \u00a31.8bn surge in. But today scarcely a word is heard about shares Isas, either from the fund groups or from the government which plugged them as a way to boost overall saving levels. </p> <p>Official figures this week showed that Isa sales drooped to just \u00a324.8m last month, and on some counts has gone negative, with more people cashing in than buying. </p> <p>Nearly everyone who bought a shares Isa in early 2000 is still nursing hefty losses, particularly if they invested in a technology fund; they are still showing 50% falls. </p> <p>Cash Isas are a different matter - they continue to be enormously successful, and are a no-brainer if you have up to \u00a33,000 to put aside. Check our best buy tables on page 16 for the pick of the deals currently available. </p> <p>But is there any point today in investing in a share Isa? Since April this year Isas have lost a 10% tax credit, and there is no longer any direct Isa income tax advantage for basic rate payers - those on the higher rate will continue to gain, although less than before. </p> <p>Simon Ellis, head of retail at AXA Investment Managers, says: \"It is clear that the take-up of Isas has fallen way behind historic levels. Indeed, there is an accelerating trend of people withdrawing from the product. </p> <p>\"Our research shows no particular catalyst for this change, but in the absence of the income tax saving that was withdrawn this year, there is little incentive to save when the tax advantage is just avoidance of capital gains tax. Given the maximum investment in any one year is only \u00a37,000, the risk of paying CGT looks very remote. </p> <p>\"The Isa in its watered-down form is becoming irrelevant. This is a real pity, since they were working for a broad swathe of the population.\" </p> <p>But others argue it can still make sense to take out an Isa. Richard Meek of IFAs Punter Southall Financial Management says: \"The reason that sales of Isas have dwindled has really nothing to do with the Isa structure, but the state of the stock markets. </p> <p>\"In people's minds Isas are synonymous with equities and so investors have been scared off by poor returns, past scandals such as tech fund promotions and overselling by IFAs in the past into the wrong sort of funds. </p> <p>\"In reality, lower risk asset classes are available within the Isa annual allowance - the whole fixed interest sector, for example. These funds provide a very attractive, tax-efficient income and do not suffer like equity funds on which the tax credit is no longer reclaimable. </p> <p>\"A bond Isa is still a very attractive option and worth keeping, even more so for the 40% taxpayer. </p> <p>Fidelity managing director Richard Wastcoat says: \"It's a myth to say that Isas are no longer worth it, especially for income funds. They have clearly lost momentum but they are not a bad investment.\" </p> <p>He warns that this year, investors are pouring into venture capital trusts for their tax advantages - without taking on board the greater risks.</p>",
  "<p>Radical changes to employment law hit the statute book yesterday, in an effort to stem the heavy flow of workplace gripes that end up in employment tribunal hearings. The Confederation of British Industry, which lobbied for the legal changes, said action could not come soon enough. Almost seven in 10 employers have told pollsters the government should stem the tide of \"weak and vexatious\" claims to tribunals. </p> <p>The new dispute resolution regulations compel employers and their staff to abide by a pre-determined procedure to settle contentious issues before a dismissal. Employers can no longer get rid of their turbulent employees after having an informal \"quiet word\". </p> <p>The new procedures will turn existing custom and practice on its head; employers will need to put the reasons for the disciplinary action or dismissal in writing, hand it to the employee and arrange a face-to-face meeting. And the employee will have a right to be accompanied by a colleague or a trade union official to any meetings to discuss their grievance. </p> <p>If the employee disagrees with the decision after that meeting, they have a right to appeal and the employer is obliged to arrange a further meeting. Employees can only opt for a decision by an employment tribunal after all three steps have been exhausted. </p> <p>If an employer fails to follow the procedure, a dismissal will be ruled unfair and any additional compensation can be increased by up to 50%. </p> <p>John Walker of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), says the rules are mechanistic and complex. \"The objectives of the legislation are sound but as with so many well-intentioned initiatives, the complexity of the regulations makes them a potential minefield for small firms,\" he says. </p> <p>Employment lawyer Murray Fair clough, who speaks for the Federation on legal matters, says: \"Unwary employers could easily find themselves falling foul of the rules. </p> <p>\"They don't just apply to conduct and capability dismissals but also to redundancies, long-term incapacity dismissals, and expiry of fixed term contracts and retirements. Moreover the new regulations apply from day one and so still need to be followed when dismissing, say, an unsuitable probationer.\" </p> <p>The new rules also extend to employees with a complaint against their bosses. Unless they have first put their grievance in writing and allowed at least 28 days to pass, they will no longer, as a general rule, be able to make a claim to an employment tribunal. </p> <p>If the grievance, disciplinary or dismissal procedures have not been followed before the tribunal, it will decide whether that is the fault of the employee. If it is, any compensation awarded will normally be reduced by at least 10% and possibly up to 50%. </p> <p>Elsewhere, a study for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development published this week found that managing conflict at work, including disciplinary and grievance cases and preparing for employment tribunals, costs the average employer nearly 450 days of management time every year. However, the CIPD poll of 1,200 organisations shows that employers are optimistic that the new regulations will help reduce the burden. </p> <p>For more information about the new Dispute Resolution Regulations which come into force on October 1, 2004 go to <a href=\"http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/resolvingdisputes\">dti.gov.uk/er/resolvingdisputes</a> </p> <p>Acas, the state-funded arbitration service, has posted a revised version of the widely used code of practice for disciplinary and grievance procedures on <a href=\"http://www.acas.org.uk/\">acas.org.uk/</a> or phone its helpline - 08457-47-47-47.</p>",
  "<p>Jon Snow comes walking into the shot, his willowy figure becoming more substantial, more recognisable, as he strides forward, all alone in the middle of the road. He stops at a police cordon, a flimsy ribbon-thing with \"no entry no entry no entry\" written along its length, hoists it aloft and folds himself swiftly beneath its constraint. </p> <p>\"I thought\" - you can just make out what the cameraman is saying - \"I thought you'd be coming through the gate.\" </p> <p>\"Gate?\" says Snow, and wanders over to take a look; yes, here indeed is a gate, placed for the convenience of pedestrians who approach Downing Street by way of the pavement. Another performer might have felt a tad discommoded, might have retraced his steps for the more conventional option of Take Two. </p> <p>Not Snow. He settles for slight recalcitrance, though jolly interested in the other point of view, of course. It's a stance that chimes harmoniously with the job he's come to do: making a documentary laying waste to the British honours system. Along the way, Snow lets it be known that he'd turned down the OBE they wanted to pin on him. Plain Mr Snow is good enough for him, he affirms reassuringly; even-handed, level-headed, trustworthy, the man who can be relied on to tell the truth to responsible citizens who tune in to Channel 4 News while others may gawp at Emmerdale. </p> <p>\"Have you read the book?\" he asks briskly, clearing a space for our interview on his book-laden dining table. He wears the trademark grey suit and rainbow tie of the respectable renegade, and is eager to be self-effacing about his first attempt at prolonged authorship. Perhaps he shouldn't have gone at it at quite such a rate of knots. Perhaps there shouldn't be quite so much on the one hand this, on the other hand that. So evenly balanced is he, I have an irrational compulsion to trip him up, knock him off his tightrope, force him to some kind of eccentric commitment. I have read his book. Not only that, but I have read the corrected proofs, so I know when he worries about his spelling and grammar, and when he has second thoughts and crosses things out. And this is the only intrusion into his legendary privacy I am going to make. </p> <p>I have quizzed his friends and colleagues, and they all say the same things. He works like a dog. He is the only presenter known to modern television who attends the morning news conference; comes in like a tornado in bicycle clips and throws into the pot what are known as his bombs. Of these, maybe five ideas are barmy, two will be libellous and three, well, three will probably be what they go with that night. There is no side to him. He is not afflicted with presenteritis; nothing is beneath his dignity. They marvel at his physical energy. He's there every day, and he's on every night, and between times he's doing his charities and his committees and God knows what. He has this wondrous foreign correspondent's reservoir of great stories. He'll talk the hind leg off a donkey. He'll regale you with hilarious tales of his father the bishop, 8ft tall in his mitre, and his mother, concave with gratitude that he married her despite the affliction of her alopecia. He is brave, endlessly kind, generous and compassionate, qualities rare in a man and impossible to describe since by doing so you'd betray their beneficiaries. Suffice to say he not only does good, he does good by stealth. Yet there is a forcefield around him, an invisible mark you would not overstep. In short, you can't get anywhere near him. </p> <p>In his book, Snow opens his account with a detailed description of his boyhood, written with the startling candour of a lifelong stoic. No whining, no sneering, no self-pity, this is what it was like to be raised a scion of the impecunious upper class, upheld by the imperatives of the military, the church and good old-fashioned conservatism. He grew up beneath the full panoply of \"privilege\", daunted by his forebears and familiarised, by dint of the institutionalised bullying, sadism and sexual molestations inherent in the public school system, to a world in which, if you want to get on, you must be inured to personal humiliation, terror and the routine exploitation of the weak by the strong. </p> <p>It was, of course, an ideal preparation for a career as a foreign correspondent - not that he knew that at the time. What he'd be, he thought when he was in short trousers, was a Conservative politician. It was what was expected of him. He did his best to please. Even sang for his supper. He was one of those angel-voiced boy-children conscripted by the Anglican church for service to a cathedral choir in exchange for a serious reduction in school fees. This so pleased his father that he was moved to reward little Jon with a gift of \"anything he liked under a pound\". He was less pleased when the child turned out to be a bit of a dunce, so that by the time he was 15 he felt obliged to threaten him with an apprenticeship to the local steel mill. </p> <p>That larned him, if only to the tune of one C-grade A-level. He was, he knew, a serious disappointment. If he felt the stirrings of rebellion against his allotted caricature, it was difficult to express them as the firebrand role had already been snapped up by his older brother Tom, who devoted his boyhood to mocking and fulminating against their father's value system in preparation for a career as a trades union official. It was left to master Jon to wince at the decibels of their conflict and be the sort of posh kid who hung around the staff, learning how the other half lives. </p> <p>There is a photograph of a family wedding, taken some time in the mid-1960s, preserved in one of those magnetic plastic frames and stuck on the refrigerator door of the Snow kitchen. It shows Jon as a gangling youth, wearing a scrupulous dark suit and with his hair flowing copiously over his shoulders. There is a newborn look about him, a stubborn confidence, as though that day he decided to stick out like a sore thumb. There had been the broadening experience of Scarborough Tech, where they sent him to scrabble for another couple of A-levels, and the levelling fields of Liverpool University, where he entertained, for a couple of heady years, the notion of becoming a barrister. At Liverpool, he contributed to the political life of the campus by joining in whatever demo was on the agenda, despite the fact that all the serious ideologues regarded him as a pinko public school liberal wanker. He distinguished himself by breaking the world record for sitting on a lavatory and for a skirmish with a policeman at a demo that landed him in court and got him rusticated. This episode threw him back on the mercies of familial convention, where black sheep were sorted out, made men of, by banishment to somewhere frightfully hot and bothered like India or Africa, and not allowed back home until they had thoroughly redeemed themselves. </p> <p>For the first time in his life, at the age of 19, he boarded a plane, under the auspices of VSO, and found himself all alone in the middle of an African rainforest, living in a concrete blockhouse with cockroaches and ants, and stunned by his own sense of total alienation. His mission was to teach English, biology, maths, technology, whatever, as defined by an English education board that made no allowance, none whatever, for the culture of the pupils. </p> <p>Hence he'd be labouring away, doing Animal Farm, and the kids would say, \"What's a carthorse, sir? What is a sheep?\" The kids were so awesomely insatiable, absorbing and absorbent, pretty soon he forgot where he was, forgot to be lonely, stopped longing to run for the hills and wound up wanting to stay in Africa for the rest of his life. As epiphanies go, it went. But he still says it was the loudest clunk of a penny dropping he ever experienced. \"You take responsibility,\" he says sternly. \"You respond to the challenge. Come to grips. Pull out every stop. It is an enhancing thing, and if that sounds pious, it is, because I am rather pious.\" </p> <p>Like all serious journalists, Snow goes with what he's got. At 56, he tries to see himself as others see him, and concludes that, yes, he has perhaps not travelled as far from his roots as he likes to imagine and probably comes across as a patronising snob and there's nothing he can do about it but try to accept his own limitations. He can say that he is not impressed by the military establishment, that war merely repels him. Nor does God bother him. He does not lie awake at night fretting if He is here, there or nowhere, yet he still adheres to the moral codes of Christianity: love thy neighbour, love thy enemy, turn the other cheek, judge not lest ye be judged. And as for conservatism - the old business of propping up the hierarchic system in order to profit from it - there's not enough of that nonsense left to kick against any more, though he must say he did thoroughly enjoy it when there was. He has, he says, used all his unfair advantages, used his access to the establishment to try to undermine it. \"I have used and abused my contacts ... And I do not fool myself. I wouldn't have got into radio and television without nepotism.\" So thank God for his cousin Peter Snow, and thank God again that it was never the BBC that took him in. He'd have sunk without trace in that institution. It would have been like going into politics. He'd never have taken the whip. </p> <p>He stands, he says, for egalitarianism, for change, meritocracy and progress. He gives brief rumination to his list and concludes, \"Yes, that'll do.\" Equality, then, social, sexual, every which way. Very difficult to achieve, but no harm in the aspiration. \"My views haven't changed much since I was a student. I was never interested in dogma. I'm still a pinko liberal. I'm not here to save the world,\" he says, with the accent on save. \"Make it a better place for people to co-exist in, yes, but I'm not interested in saving anything, even money.\" </p> <p>It is time, I think impatiently, for a touch of contention. I was drawn, I say slimily, to page 324 of his text, where he has a bit of an argument with himself over the Clinton/Lewinsky affair - \"I'm not critical of any of that stuff,\" he says, as though that must be the end of it - where he writes, I go on, \"his Achilles heel was a woman\", and \"so many of us men must have thought: there but for the grace of God ...\" </p> <p>This latter was crossed out, amended to something a shade less brazen, but I'm using it as a stick to beat him with. Hang on, he says, we're talking about a man's human frailty, exposed for political ends by his political enemies. Any one of us could have ... then he claims to have no view on the matter, one way or another. </p> <p>I nag on. Voices begin to lift and swell. If Clinton exploited anyone, he was wrong, he says. \"If?\" I bawl. If he exploited anyone? So far as he understood Monica Lewinsky, he says, and he interviewed her, she wanted to have sex with the president. The choice was hers. Clinton has that effect on women. Lewinsky wasn't a teenager - she was 24 years old. Do I not believe that an adult woman has the right to choose who she has sex with? Yes, I sneer, 24 going on 12. For common decency, Clinton had the obligation to say no. Did he? Did he? Come-come. Yes, I bellow, he bloody well did, else we've got the world's most powerful man behaving like some Victorian tyrant who feels himself entitled ... well, I put it about as crudely as I could. Oh, says Mr Snow. Now that is repellent! And he sighs a deep sigh in which I rather fancy he is doing his best to forgive me for my repugnant remark. </p> <p>I don't know what would have happened if his wife had not walked in. \"Hello,\" she said, with a smile like the sunrise, \"I could hear raised voices all up the street\", and then went out into the kitchen where we could hear her laughing. Snow looked slightly sheepish. \"I had this same row with her before,\" he explains. \"She finds me exasperating, too.\" </p> <p>But he's not letting go. Apparently, I had used the word \"evil\" in the heat of the moment. \"'Evil' I'm not going to entertain. Oh, it's bandied about, usually by the neo-cons. 'Axis of evil' was the stupidest thing anyone ever said. 'Evil' is not in my dictionary. No, there is not, no, not ever, never a tiny, pinpoint nanosecond where no other word will do. Once you say something is evil, you absolve people of responsibility, as though it is something that comes from outside over which they have no control. I try to escape from absolutes of any sort. Absolutes are trouble. You can't go about deploying words like evil and get away with it.\" </p> <p>And he retreats to his middle ground, reiterating his mantra about there being only degrees of goodness and badness, degrees of human frailty, nobody's perfect. \"You'll not put me off my stride,\" he promises. Then he gives an inch. He worries about pornography. He won't say it's evil, but he will say it is wrong, because it is exploitative. He will go so far as to say he feels very strongly about pornography. \"The internet is driven by it. I have no idea what it is, but there seems to be some very strange need in society which nobody has addressed but, whatever it is, it drives an industry that is itself entirely driven by exploitation. It is not,\" he says, reaching for the word, \"an enhancing thing.\" </p> <p>He is not a fan of the great technological revolution. We can do all these frightfully clever things with graphics and gizmos until people are watching the news and seeing a virtual reality programme. And if the whole construct is virtual reality, who is to say the entire content isn't virtual reality as well? </p> <p>When he came in off the road and became a news presenter, he was very much afraid that viewers would imagine he was really in some terrible, war-torn disaster area when he was actually sitting in a studio with a picture of it stuck up behind him, spouting information gathered at third or fourth hand. \"What we need is to be told by one other human being with a pair of eyes what it's like to be at this place where things are happening.\" He points two fingers to his eyes. \"That is what we are losing. We are deluging people with information, but no insight, no human connection. This is anti-communication. Information that doesn't connect with the one pair of eyes and therefore doesn't connect with their own living experience. They are emotionally disconnected, inured. They might as well be watching a feature film.\" </p> <p>The fourth estate falls short when it sees itself as apolitical and unemotional. He could never go into El Salvador and say heigh-ho, another load of dead peasants by the roadside, courtesy of the American death squads. He'd be lying if he did. Being neutral twists the truth, denies humanity, makes tragedy commonplace. \"That is what is so dangerous about Iraq now, because so few pairs of eyes are witnessing what is going on that it has become part of the plethora of material that invades our minds, half-fact, half-fiction, that is so easy to switch off from.\" </p> <p>The other day, Snow had a flash of that old newsreel image of Jack Kennedy driving in his open car into Texas with his elbow hanging out of the car, the moment before he was shot. And he thought to himself, that was it, that was the end of innocence. He had been thinking that 9/11 was a sort of one-off. And perhaps it wasn't. He sees the world as north and south, meaning the developed and the developing worlds, and the enormous gulf between the two. If you look at the text messaging that went on after 9/11, he says, you will know that from Indonesia to southern Africa there was not the degree of upset that there was from New York to Belgrade, that by and large the south was supportive of Bin Laden's action. The press, and television in particular, have contributed to a situation where the south is wising up while the north dumbs down. In other words, they know more about us than we know about them. We don't know how they live and they know exactly how we live. </p> <p>With the haves and have-nots, it was always so. \"If we fail as journalists to keep people engaged in the world we live in,\" he says darkly, \"and the consequences of the way we live, then eventually, as I put in the book, they will come and visit us.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Shooting History: A Personal Journey, by Jon Snow, is published by HarperCollins on October 4.</p>",
  "<p>It must be hard to do other things after, or during, a high profile and extremely successful career in music. Madonna dropped in on <strong>Will and Grace</strong> (Channel 4) last night, as Karen's new room-mate Liz. Liz is a kooky and desperate fortysomething woman who works in the music business. Karen and Liz fall in, they go out, they fight over Kirk who wears dockers and has Red Bull breath and who isn't interested in either of them, and then they fall out again. And in doing so, Madge shows a healthy and delightful willingness to make a bit of a tit of herself. There's something about Will and Grace that makes its cameo guests, often huge stars with equally huge egos, lighten up and do that. </p> <p>I don't think Chrissie Hynde is going to be doing anything so frivolous as dropping in on Will and Grace. The Pretenders frontwoman, subject of last night's <strong>Pop and Politics</strong> (BBC4), is now a furiously committed vegetarian and animal rights campaigner. </p> <p>Her background doesn't obviously point her along this path - middle America, then punk London of the late 1970s and early 1980s, where she wrote a bit for the New Musical Express and worked in Malcolm McLaren's shop Sex before forming the Pretenders. But she claims there was a real vegetarian thing going on among those early punks. Is she sure? They certainly didn't seem to share Hynde's problem with leather, if I remember right. </p> <p>\"I wasn't aware of her vegetarianism then, probably because I never ate with her,\" says Charles Shaar Murray, who was at the NME at the time. \"But then because of some of the drugs that were around, a lot of the people around the NME barely ate at all.\" </p> <p>Hynde shrugs off the deaths of two of the other three Pretenders through drugs overdoses. \"That wasn't any big surprise,\" she says. Paul Morley, who made this excellent film, says that it was probably Hynde's disappointment in other people that turned her to animals. </p> <p>Now they're her life, and meat eating is the number one reason for all the problems in the world. \"I'm not a sentimental person and I don't see this is as 'Oh, the poor suffering animals,'\" she says. \"To me, this is a war.\" </p> <p>I think perhaps an appearance on Will and Grace might do her some good.</p>",
  "<p>After three years of university, most students are well skilled in the art of research.

Despite the wealth of printed and online careers material now available to students, graduate employers continue to moan that too many of the applicants they see have made little or no effort to research their industry sector, the jobs they have on offer and the skills they're looking for.</p> <p>Graduate fairs are where lack of research becomes painfully obvious. Employers spend tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of pounds on their recruitment websites, brochures and advertising, but they know that at each graduate fair they attend, a fair proportion of the students and graduates that approach their stand will kick off the conversation with \"So, what do you do then? \" And yet somehow they expect to walk away with a job offer.</p> <p>However, by applying the same research methods and using the same sources of information you have at university, graduate fairs can be a great deal more productive, successful ... and maybe even some fun.</p> <p>If you're planning to attend the EGREX graduate fair at London's Excel centre on October 20 and 21, now's the time to begin your research if you're serious about securing a job.</p> <p>EGREX has become one of the biggest graduate recruitment fairs on the calendar, with more than 100 employers offering thousands of jobs - from retailers Arcadia, , Debehnams and Sainsburys to public sector employers like the Audit Commission, Foreign Office and the RAF; and from professional services firms Baker Tilly and PricewaterhouseCoopers to huge multinationals including Microsoft, Siemens and Diageo.</p> <p>So, what homework can you do ahead of the event?</p> <p><strong>1. Research the sectors</strong></p> <p>Buy the fair catalogue in advance (see www. egrex. com)to research the breadth of industry sectors represented. Consider some of the sectors you may previously have ignored or ruled out. Many job roles - such as marketing or accounting, for example - can be done in a wide variety of sectors from the public sector to IT or retail. You don't have to work for a marketing agency or accountancy firm.</p> <p>\"There's a wealth of potential in retail for graduates who have completed degrees in anything from maths to textiles, \" says a spokesperson for Arcadia's training programmes team. \"Many graduates don't apply to retailers because they are unaware of the scope of opportunities and sheer size of the sector - they don't appreciate that retail is the second largest private sector employer within the UK and the fifth largest employer of graduates. \" </p> <p><strong>2. Research the companies</strong></p> <p>Once you have decided which employers you are going to target at the fair, read their websites and find their promotional literature in your careers service. If you can't find it, ring up the company direct and ask someone in graduate recruitment to send you relevant details. With a few specific questions on areas like training schemes or business objectives you can demonstrate to employers that you are serious about working for them. Check the online news services to see how the company's recent performance and announcements have been reported. Employers like to see that you have done your research, but they won't expect you to be an expert.</p> <p><strong>3. Research the skills</strong></p> <p>Read job advertisements and graduate programme details carefully to grasp the key skills and competencies that employers are looking for. \"Because so many organisation now use UCAS points and degree classification as a sift when recruiting graduates, many students now think that if they have the grades or have been to a top 10 university that this is enough, \" says Philippa Morris, graduate recruitment manager at the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p> <p>\"But graduates should remember that many employers of our size have had to introduce these academic screening tools as a response to the huge numbers of applications we've receive in the last few years. We introduced UCAS points for the first time last year after receiving more than 18,000 applications for 200 places. </p> <p>\"So don't be fooled - recruiters want graduates who have got the academic ability and more. Our selection process is competency based - we look for skills and personal attributes that we know will make you a successful graduate trainee in your chosen area. \"</p> <p>Philippa is running a seminar at EGREX where she will be outlining some of the skills and personal attributes that are commonly looked for by employers and to set students thinking about ways they can learn these skills.</p> <p>Aside from a series of employer-led presentations, the EGREX organisers are also offering free seminars on a variety of subjects, from online applications and CVs to aptitude tests and interviewing technique.</p> <p>You can register for the fast track entry system to the fair by visiting <a href=\"http://www.egrex.co.uk\">www.egrex.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It's that time of year when the corporate bandwagon begins to roll onto campus, with everything from company presentations to skills sessions and careers fairs on offer. If you're lucky they'll dish out some freebies. But other than knocking back the canap\u00e9s and ice cream, how should you handle the milkround?</p> <p>Arguably, the milkround has lost its bottle in recent years. These days it is more about marketing and brand awareness than recruiting. But here's how to make the most of what's left:</p> <p><strong>1. Start at the careers service</strong></p> <p>Your careers service oversees employer visits, so visit their website regularly to find out who's coming onto campus. \"Keep in touch with us,\" urges Jenny Goddard, careers adviser at Warwick University. \"There will be additions and amendments throughout the term.\" Many universities allow you to reserve your places online; so don't drag your feet. \"The most popular employers get booked up quickly,\" she adds. \"It's a shame because some students leave it too late and get disappointed.\"</p> <p><strong>2. Be prepared</strong></p> <p>Like any stage of the job application process, it pays to do your research. A general awareness of the company you are meeting will help, and some insightful questions will impress. If you aren't sure what kind of career you'd be interested in, however, there is nothing wrong with a more casual approach. \"Milkround events can also help you define your direction,\" argues Jenny Goddard. \"By going along you might learn about yourself and what is or isn't suitable for you.\"</p> <p><strong>3. Use your discretion</strong></p> <p>Dress smartly and appropriately (check the dress code in advance). Some presentations are held in local hotels, or employer offices, so buff up on the logistics to get there on time. Oh, and go easy on the freebies. \"Some organisations provide very generous hospitality,\" explains Jenny Goddard. \"That can be fun, but it's not the reason to go. Having a glass of wine and talking to a recruiter is a nice way of relaxing at the end of the day, but obviously you shouldn't judge a career by the quality of the nibbles.\"</p> <p><strong>4. Talk to people</strong></p> <p>Soak up the information at the session, but if you want to take full advantage, do some informal networking at the end. Many companies bring along recent graduate recruits, often from your university. Chat to them. (This is where you can ask those well-prepared questions). Use it as an opportunity to dig deeper into the company culture.</p> <p><strong>5. Don't expect a job offer</strong></p> <p>The milkround is primarily a marketing event, rather than a pretext to handpick the best students. \"I find that a lot of people assume a presentation is an interview, but they need to be aware that now isn't the time for us to make an informed decision,\" explains Suzy Style, graduate recruitment head at Accenture. \"On the other hand, we can certainly spot someone who has potential. Very often a rep will make a note of your name and perhaps buddy you through the application process.\"</p> <p><strong>6. Don't take it personally</strong></p> <p>Employers cherry pick the universities they will visit. However, if an organisation you like isn't attending your campus, you should still apply. With the best will in the world no company can get around every university. \"It doesn't mean we're not interested,\" explains Suzy Style. \"Proactive students often contact us asking whether we would mind if they attended a local presentation at another university. Usually there isn't a problem.\"</p> <p><strong>7. Attend anyway</strong></p> <p>Even if you find blue chip corporations a turn-off, attend anyway. Skills sessions can be particularly useful for interviews, CVs and applications. Presentations can also be informative as industry insights. \"If you wanted to learn about marketing, for example, finding out about Proctor &amp; Gamble's marketing scheme will be good for your research,\" adds Jenny Goddard.</p> <p><strong>8. Broaden your approach</strong></p> <p>Only a fifth of graduates are employed by UK blue chip companies every year, and limiting yourself to the employers who have big budgets to splash on milkround events will rule out plenty of interesting small-to-medium sized firms. \"There are many organisations who don't have the time or money to put on any presentations but are still interested in recruiting graduates,\" stresses Jenny Goddard. \"You just have to be more proactive.\"</p> <p><strong>9. Keep in touch</strong></p> <p>\"The best thing about the milkround is the opportunity to speak to people from the company,\" says Accenture's Suzy Style. \"Make the most of it and if you can get contact details of the particular representative you speak to, then follow up with them and they can support you through an application process.\" Take a note of their names and make sure you refer to them in your application or at interview. A touch of name-dropping never hurts.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barlowtom@hotmail.com\">barlowtom@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>\"It was a childhood dream to join the police. However, as I got older my parents encouraged me to go to university. I chose facilities management because I was always interested in physical activity and enjoyed the business-related subjects.</p> <p>\"My interest in joining the police was re-kindled while speaking to a relative who is a senior officer at force headquarters. He told me about the day-to-day life of an operational officer and about the good career structure. I had a tour of the headquarters and spoke to other officers. After that I was eager to sign on the dotted line. </p> <p>\"Long term, my career will entail getting my promotion exams, being promoted and being trained in public order and firearms. I've learned how to speak to the public, how to manage my time and how to calm down a potentially violent situation. In general, I have greater self confidence. </p> <p>\"I thought there would be less paperwork. I had no idea of the amount of forms I would fill in and the number of cases I would write. </p> <p>\"From watching TV programmes like The Bill I imagined that when you arrested someone there would be a quick turnaround and you would be back patrolling your area. </p> <p>\"At the morning briefing I'm assigned a call sign and a neighbourhood and we patrol the streets in a marked car.</p> <p>\"I work an early, late and nightshift - seven days on then a couple of days off.

  "<p>The play we've just started rehearsing, The Battle of Green Lanes, is important to me for two reasons. It's the first play to run since I took over as artistic director three months ago, and secondly it's a play about a Cypriot lad whose parents came to the UK - which is exactly my upbringing.</p> <p>In the play, which is based on a true story, the protagonist is recruited by an Islamic fundamentalist group. My life is somewhat different in that I threw my energies into the theatre.</p> <p>I certainly wouldn't describe myself as having the usual background of a man running a theatre. Academic study at school wasn't really me - but I was fortunate to have a great drama teacher and I channelled my energies into that. I didn't go to university or drama school and instead went straight into acting.</p> <p>That quickly led in turn to directing, and my big break was when a play I had put on at the Edinburgh was transferred to the King's Head theatre in Islington, London.</p> <p>It was important as I was offered an Arts Council bursary on the back of it and landed a job as assistant director at the Contact Theatre in Manchester. The bursary was extended and I came south to join Stratford East. When I was appointed to this job I think I was the youngest theatre director in the country.</p> <p>For those who don't know much about this theatre, we are situated in the heart of one of the most culturally diverse and poorest areas of London, and the country. We also have a very transient community - lots of refugees - and one of the challenges we face is to represent those people's lives.</p> <p>Over the past few years the theatre has built a reputation for producing radical work that reflects the community, and it's my aim to build on that platform in the future. For example after The Battle of Green Lanes, we have a play set in a Trinidadian drag club, which again is a very topical subject at the moment. At the heart of everything we do is a desire to give the communities around us a voice. We have five youth theatre groups trying to do just that.</p> <p>Although I have the day-to-day running of theatre with a \u00a32.5m turnover to consider, I still take rehearsals myself, and it's a fundamental part of the job. I'm proud of the fact that I didn't take the usual route into directing, and that I found my place.</p> <p>One of the odd things for me as a young man was that there were no obvious role models for me to emulate from the Cypriot community. For that reason it took me a while to find my voice as an artist. Now that I have, it feels very right. I have my dream job and can't think of another role I'd rather do.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:miles.brignall@tiscali.fr\">miles.brignall@tiscali.fr</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Author: </strong> Angela Carter (1940-1992) worked briefly for the Croydon Advertiser, before leaving to read medieval literature at Bristol University in 1962. Her second novel, The Magic Toyshop (1967), was awarded the Somerset Maugham prize, which enabled her to leave Britain for an extended spell in Japan. Through the late 1960s and 1970s she cemented a reputation as a formidable feminist critic and novelist. 1979 saw the publication of two key works, The Sadeian Woman and The Bloody Chamber . Her work remained influential through the 1980s; her final novel, Wise Children being published in 1991. She died of lung cancer a year later. </p> <p><strong> Story: </strong> Like all the stories in The Bloody Chamber, The Company of Wolves is a baroque reworking of a traditional fairytale that exposes their fundamental function of the social control of women, most particularly in terms of sexuality. Carter fuses the Red Riding Hood story with the werewolf myth: a girl on her way to see her grandmother is accosted in a forest by a predatory \"hunter\" who then disposes of the old woman and lies in wait for the younger. When the girl reaches the cottage, the hunter transforms into a wolf - with the famous line \"I love the company of wolves\" - strips the girl naked, and they finish asleep together in the grandmother's bed. </p> <p><strong> Film-makers: </strong> After winning the Guardian Fiction prize in 1976 for the short-story collection Night in Tunisia, Neil Jordan (b1950) has combined a literary career with film-making since the early 1980s. His first feature, Angel (1982), was made under the tutelage of John Boorman. Successful film distributors Palace Pictures - run by Stephen Woolley, Nik Powell and Chris Brown - wanted to get into film production, and took on the financing of The Company of Wolves , beginning a long-running relationship between Jordan and Woolley in particular. Carter worked on the script with Jordan, and after a long search for a lead actress, the role of Rosanna was given to 14-year-old schoolgirl Sarah Patterson. </p> <p><strong>How book and film compare: </strong>The Bloody Chamber contains two other wolf-related tales - The Werewolf and Wolf-Alice - and elements of both of these stories find their way into the film, helping to bulk out the nine-page original into a substantial screenplay. From the former comes the idea of the wolf's paw that changes into a human hand after being severed; from the latter, the wolf-raised girl who appears in a final dream sequence. The film also expands on the miniature tales-within-tales contained in Carter's original to create bravura sequences such as the werewolf-infected wedding. However, the contemporary-set prologue, with its explicit dream-logic is an invention of the film-makers and any overt sexual content is removed. </p> <p><strong>Inspirations and influences:</strong> </p> <p>The Company of Wolves was part of a mid-1980s resurgence in British art cinema - films such as The Draughtsman's Contract (1982) and Caravaggio (1986) defiantly turned away from the British realist tradition. At the same time, Jordan and Palace cannily exploited a vogue for postmodern werewolf movies - An American Werewolf in London, The Howling and Wolfen (all 1981). Jordan built on Wolves' success with Mona Lisa (1985), and breakthrough international hit The Crying Game (1992), both of which explore different aspects of infatuation and desire.</p>",
  "<p>In a way, the makers of Spinal Tap had it easy with heavy metal. A genre populated in the main by enormous egos, by odd British men, and with its own strange rituals ... this was satire very much waiting to be gathered. All its makers had to do was shake the tree.</p> <p>Heavy metal, though, has had it considerably harder with Spinal Tap. Just as Smashie and Nicey helped kill the old-style Radio 1 DJ, Tap helped put the nail in the coffin of a certain type of heavy rock. The last thing you would want to do, one would think, if you were Metallica, and going through some tough times, would be to commission a film about yourself, and risk conforming to stereotypes long established as the characteristics of very misguided men. But this is what they did. It is, in short, the action of a group with armadillos in their trousers.</p> <p>So let's salute Tap and Metallica both. Two bands with issues, not afraid to confront them in public. Two bands with their ridiculous qualities, of course, but still unselfconscious enough to let their hair down while the cameras roll.</p> <p>OK, but which one's which? </p> <p><strong>\"A documentary, if you will, rockumentary ...\"</strong></p> <p><strong>The scene:</strong> Having impressed the group with their film on the West Memphis Three, documentary film-makers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky undertake the making of a film about Metallica. Unfortunately, this coincides with the group's inter-personal and musical relationships, not to mention public popularity, all hitting an all-time low.</p> <p><strong>Too much perspective:</strong> Commercial director Marty DiBergi (\"The little dog that chases the covered wagon under the sink? That was one of mine ... \") sets out to make a documentary about British heavy metal band Spinal Tap. Unfortunately, this coincides with the group's inter-personal and musical relationships, not to mention public popularity, hitting an all-time low.</p> <p><strong>The guru</strong></p> <p><strong>The scene:</strong> Relations between Metallica principals Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield having broken down, the band decide, at the suggestion of their management team, to employ the services of therapist/performance-enhancement specialist Phil Towle to aid in the recording of their new album. To start with, Phil makes helpful suggestions about channelling aggression. By the end of sessions, he is contributing lyrics, ascribing mood zones to the studio, and thinking of selling his house and moving to California to be with the group full time.</p> <p><strong>Too much perspective:</strong> It's all reminiscent of the growing influence on Spinal Tap of co-manager Jeanine Pettibone, girlfriend of guitarist David St Hubbins. \"Before I met Jeanine I was cosmically a shambles,\" says David. Says Jeanine: \"I say, 'That's good.' Or 'That's bad.' Or 'That's shit.'\"</p> <p><strong>The niggling details </strong></p> <p><strong> The scene:</strong> As the band prepare to begin recording, they take a look around the studio to check on the set-up of their equipment. As they walk round, they notice a microphone stand which has been incorrectly labelled as belonging to \"Mettlica\". Lars and James are not impressed. \"Mettlica. They can't even spell it right,\" James complains. \"We've only been together 20 years ... \"</p> <p><strong>Too much perspective:</strong> Minor annoyances like this plagued the day-to-day existence of Spinal Tap. Our tour, Nigel Tufnel is seen to complain to his manager Ian Faith about the \"backstage arrangements\". \"I want large bread. Would you be happy holding this? That's exhibit A.\"</p> <p><strong>The arguments</strong></p> <p>Rather than use the method that has produced their previous successful albums (one person brings in ideas, which are worked into songs), it is decided the new Metallica compositions will derive from collective, non-hierarchical jam sessions. Eighteen months of largely inspiration-free noodling duly ensues. As, after one such depressing musical encounter, does the following argument.</p> <p>Lars: \"I'm trying to do something different.\"</p> <p>James: \"I'm used to hearing the drummer do the ... beat part.\"</p> <p>Lars: \"What I'm hearing, it sounds a little stark.\"</p> <p>James: \"That's such bullshit.\"</p> <p>Lars: \"I think it sounds stark. What part of that don't you understand? Do you want me to write it down?\" (James storms out)</p> <p><strong>Too much perspective:</strong> \"We're closer than brothers,\" says David St Hubbins. \"Brothers always fight.\"</p> <p><strong>The military facility </strong></p> <p><strong> The scene:</strong> Rather than using a familiar studio, the band decide to use a new location to match the new working methods that they'll be using when recording the album. They hire space at the Presidio, a military barracks outside San Francisco. \"There's definitely a vibe here,\" says James. Such is the vibe he quickly leaves the band and enters rehab for a year. The space at the Presidio is not used again.</p> <p><strong>Too much perspective:</strong> After the cancellation of a gig in Seattle, Jeanine arranges for Spinal Tap to play at an USAF mixer social, where they are greeted by a military official. \"We're big fans of all your records. By which I don't mean yours personally, but the whole genre of rock'n'roll ... \"</p> <p>The gig goes disastrously. Nigel leaves the group.</p> <p><strong>The changing cast of musicians </strong></p> <p><strong> The scene:</strong> For Spinal Tap, the problem was drummers. For Metallica, it's been bass players. Original bass player Cliff Burton was killed in a bus crash when the band were on tour in Sweden in 1986. Some Kind Of Monster joins the band after the departure of his replacement, the prominently-chinned Jason Newsted. Jason leaves after James admits he cannot deal with Jason having a side project, Echobrain. As a gesture of goodwill to new arrival Robert Trujillo, they pay him a million dollars.</p> <p><strong>Too much perspective:</strong> Of the demise of their second drummer Eric \"Stumpy Joe\" Childs, Spinal Tap bass player Derek Smalls explains: \"The official explanation is that he choked on vomit. Though they think it may have been someone else's.\"</p> <p><strong>The music</strong></p> <p><strong>The scene:</strong> With James in rehab, work on the new Metallica album is dramatically slowed. During a visit from his father Torbin, Lars plays him a track which consists of vaguely demonic wailing. His father is unimpressed. \"It just sounds to me like some guys who just got an echo machine.\" Lars laughs hysterically. But there is pain in his eyes.</p> <p><strong>Too much perspective:</strong> In his own time, Nigel Tufnel works on gentle piano material in D minor, \"the saddest of all keys\". He plays a piece for Marty. \"It's called Lick My Love Pump,\" he explains.</p> <p><strong>The fans </strong></p> <p><strong> The scene:</strong> The film joins Metallica in the wake of their dispute with Napster, the online music file-sharing service. \"I have become the most hated man in rock'n'roll,\" laments Lars to an interviewer.</p> <p><strong>Too much perspective:</strong> At a gig in Stockton, California, Tap realise that without Nigel on guitar, they can only play 10 minutes of material. They decide to debut Jazz Odyssey, a composition by bass player Derek Smalls. \"Hope you like our new direction,\" they announce. The band are booed.</p> <p><strong>The guitar solos</strong></p> <p><strong>The scene:</strong> As the band struggle to maintain some relevance in the marketplace, Lars Ulrich wonders if guitar solos are an anachronism for today's rock band. This he says to the alarm of lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, whose chief role in Metallica is to supply those guitar solos. If they are excised from the band's sound, his only discernible contribution to Metallica will be his growing resemblance to the character actor Steve Buscemi. \"No guitar solos ... it's just a trend,\" he protests.</p> <p><strong>Too much perspective:</strong> Nigel Tufnel's solo spot during the Tap stage show, during which he plays a guitar with his foot. \"My solos are my trademark,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Metallica: Some Kind Of Monster is out now</p>",
  "<p><strong>Wages of Sin, by Stephen Coonts (Orion, \u00a312.99)</strong></p> <p>Coonts regularly pulls off one of the trickiest feats of thriller writing - combining convincing action, drama and high tension with humour, but without descending to a flippant disregard for human life and morality. Tommy Carmellini, a former expert burglar turned CIA agent, is sent to help guard a remote company safe house in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia where a star KGB defector is being debriefed. But the house is attacked by ruthless mercenaries who slaughter everyone except, of course, Tommy, the KGB man and a beautiful female agent called Kelly.</p> <p>The word is put out that Tommy was responsible for the killings, so there is no refuge with the police or CIA. What they need to find out is what powerful American was so worried about what the KGB man could divulge that such drastic action was required. The answer, which emerges in the middle of a presidential election campaign, is that the chief villain is very important indeed.</p> <p><strong>Overkill, by James Barrington (Macmillan, \u00a312.99)</strong></p> <p>If you must make your readers wait until page 317 before explaining what the hell is going on, you should at least maintain the flow and tension until then. But what we have here is a farrago of preparation, an over-detailed and over-indulgent scatter-gun approach in which tiny pieces of the jigsaw are scattered around countless fragments of narrative from a score of different locations. And the plot (when you finally reach it) is that dissident Russian intelligence bosses - without the knowledge of the Kremlin - get together with... wait for it, al-Qaida to plant neutron bombs in Europe and America in a bid for world domination. Not merely absurd and laughable but utterly idiotic. The man who rides, flies, runs, fights and kills to the rescue is Paul Richter, one of the most viciously psychopathic and deeply unlikeable characters ever to be given a hero's role in a thriller.</p> <p><strong>The Golden Silence, by Paul Johnston (Hodder, \u00a318.99)</strong></p> <p>Athens, we have been told, only finished its preparations for the Olympics with days to spare. Paul Johnston's new thriller is set about 18 months before, in a very edgy Athens full of roadworks and building projects, with no-one knowing if it is all going to be a triumph or a disaster. This is the setting in which half-Greek, half-Scots private investigator Alex Mavros begins his hunt for a young Russian immigrant who seems to have slipped into the clutches of the city's seamy, steamy and murderous underworld.</p> <p>Johnston's previous novels have mostly been very elegant and well written, so it is surprising to come upon such crudely drawn characters as a pair of torturers called \"The Father\" and \"The Son\", and the female crime boss, Rea Chioti, who is strangely in thrall to a 15th-century BC funeral mask. But, as in all the best thrillers, bullets and fists fly in profusion as Alex follows the trail to the missing girl and finds relationships moulded in the agonising fires of Greece's awful time under the colonels.</p> <p><strong>Indelible, by Karin Slaughter (Century, \u00a312.99)</strong></p> <p>This is an example of how murky past events can fling a poison-tipped javelin into the present and create havoc. Two vicious killers invade the police station of a town in Georgia, and set about murdering police officers and civilians alike. Medical examiner Sara Linton and her former husband, police chief Jeffrey Tolliver, who has been gravely wounded, are in the heart of the action, trying to cope with what at first seems like a random attack. But then it begins to emerge that the mayhem has roots in an incident 12 years before when Jeffrey took Sara to his rural home-town of Sylacauga, Alabama. A tragic shooting incident stirred the local pot of resentment, and was never fully resolved. While Sara works to save Jeffrey's life, Detective Lena Adams is with the hostage team, and we are prepared for the classic confrontation involving tough men, and equally tough women, Karin Slaughter is so good at.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Nazi Chic? Fashioning Women in the Third Reich</strong> by Irene Guenther 499pp, Berg, \u00a355 <br> </p> <p>The knit jacket called a Berchtesgadener J\u00e4ckchen wasn't official uniform for young women in any Nazi organisation, but it met most National Socialist criteria for correct garb. It was German-made, by a small mill in Wiesbaden set up by a disabled veteran of the first world war; German in folk-costume styling, black with scarlet and green trim and pewter buttons stamped with edelweiss. It was a chic confection - ready-to-wear; or rather a schicke Konfektion, since all French-derived fashion terms had been Germanified during the first world war, and therefore a deserved bestseller among patriotic M\u00e4dchens; German ready-to-wear was of such high quality that even the French had had Paris designs mass-made sans labels over the border since the 19th century. </p> <p>You already know how this story ends, don't you? The veteran, Julius Hallheimer, was Jewish, and his business dwindled as the Nazis evicted Jews from economic life. His firm was Aryanised in 1938, handed over to an ex-employee: Hallheimer committed suicide in 1943, hours before the Gestapo arrived. By which time, judging from Irene Guenther's sustained research into the dearth of gear in the wartime Reich, even a ragged J\u00e4ckchen would have been precious, swappable for food if the garment hadn't already been requisitioned to warm the Wehr-macht on the Russian front. </p> <p>Guenther is sparing of personal stories in her analysis of what women wore, and were supposed to wear, under the Nazis; the few she chooses she uses with pitiless sympathy. First, however, she investigates the background of the German states and an inferiority complex about self-presentation that went back to the Franco-Prussian war, if not the 18th century. She stresses the seriousness of her subject, how it demonstrates Nazi self-deception in ideology, economics and organisation. She has a very original chapter about the National Fashion Institute, which planned tasteful colour cards for spring 1944, when the Fatherland stank for lack of soap and women knitted sanitary towels from unravelled burlap sacks. </p> <p>The Nazis wanted women to be traditional, in outfits sourced in Tracht folk costume, yet as modern as an Autobahn; to appear natural even if that meant bleaching their plaits with Schwarzkopf Extra-Blond shampoo; to wear uniform without aspiring to masculine privileges. But genuine farming females didn't have the time to raise flax and rear sheep, let alone spin and weave Tracht to support the Nazi attempt at autarky. It was urban women who bought factory-sewn Tracht copies, often from Jewish-owned department stores. And though the Nazis were anxious that German/Austrian style should be internationally influential, the world was in fact clad in Dirndl and Loden by 1938 because of the musical White Horse Inn, the Salzberg festival and, especially, the whim of Marlene Dietrich (by then a US citizen and an anti-Nazi). </p> <p>Anyway, the Reichsbrass, though they might personally incline to preposterous outfits (Goering wore thigh-high boots, transparent linen shirts and heavy eyeshadow), didn't fancy Gretchen types for anything but propaganda purposes. Hitler rescinded a decree so that Eva Braun could have her hair permed, and paid the bills for her French cosmetics and Ferragamo shoes from Italy. The F\u00fchrer himself must have authorised the dispatch of a courier from his Berlin bunker through the Russian-bombarded ruins to a salon to collect Eva's urgent order for the couture gown in which she married and committed suicide. </p> <p>Certain Berlin designers did surprisingly good business in glam frocks through the air raids, then repaired Russian uniforms and dressed the wives of Soviet occupiers before finally making their fortunes mink-stole-ing the jet set in the Adenauer years. </p> <p>There were little black farces. French fashion was condemned for years as decadent yet the German designer Hilda Romatski attended Schiaparelli's autumn 1939 collection in Paris and snipped off two of Elsa's signature \"S\" buttons, which she sewed side-by-side on one of her own suits: the theft was ignored in Germany - French creativity was to be plundered and the Reich planned to transfer the fashion industry to Berlin after Paris fell - but Romatski was accused of treason by a senior SS officer who thought she mocked his uniform. </p> <p>There were vast dark tragedies. \"Elegance will now disappear from Berlin along with the Jews,\" whinged Magda Goebbels, who bought from Jewish designers until they emigrated or were transported to the ghettos and the camps. Senior Nazis, including her husband, exhorted the homeland never to wear anything made by degenerate non-Aryans; yet by the time the Lodz ghetto was \"liquidated\" in 1944, other senior Nazis had made a profit of 46m marks from workshops that crafted felt flowers for hats and 400,000 pairs of army epaulettes, besides more essential wear, such as wooden-soled slippers, reserved for party officials or the black market. </p> <p>Concentration camp inmates sweatshopped for the Reich, too: women were worked to death minding mills, spinning rationed ersatz yardage from sawdust and food waste to uniform the military (the cloth almost dissolved in rain). Meanwhile, a few top hands refashioned quality materials, deposited in warehouses after the extermination of their owners, into clothes, including evening gowns, for SS families, mistresses and female guards. Two custom-made dresses a week per slave, to be picked up Sunday noon. </p> <p>Guenther never editorialises and the more insane the reality, the more calmly and carefully she balances her facts. In the spring of 1945, a season for which the Fashion Institute had not prepared a colour card - Prussian blue was by then out of date - Allied troops discovered the wife of a camp commandant hiding among her huge wardrobe of handtailored clothes and furs, a trousseau from the dead. The first postwar show did produce an unambivalent German fashion at last: the Flickenkleid, a dress patchworked from scraps of fabric and accessorised with a handbag woven from salvaged gas-mask straps.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Said and Orientalists</strong><br> </p> <p>Tom Paulin (\"Writing to the moment\", September 25) was right to remember the passion and commitment that motivated Edward Said's work. What his essay left out was the contradiction between Said's love of debate and his inability to hold discussions with people who did not share his views. In his spats with Bernard Lewis in the New York Review of Books and with Ernest Gellner in the TLS, Said questioned their credentials and motives. </p> <p>Paulin says that Said's most influential work was Orientalism. Perhaps so, but it is noticeable that the high praise that he and others heap on it is not echoed by those who have made it their life's work to study the Middle East. Said had no problem with this since such people were \"Orientalists\" and therefore part of the imperialist project. <br> <strong> David Pavett</strong><br> Isleworth, Middlesex </p> <p>Standing on Edward Said's shoulders, Tom Paulin seems to detect a direct line of descent from Camus's \"plain style and unadorned reporting\" to the \"seemingly opinion-less politics of contemporary western journalism\". This suggests that he is ill-acquainted with Camus's own journalism, from the prewar Alger R\u00e9publicain, through Combat in the 1940s to L'Express in the 1950s. The style of Camus's 1939 report on famine in the Berber region of Kabylia, for instance, may be plain and unadorned, but its message is clear: stop this suffering now. <br> <strong> Neil Foxlee</strong><br> Lancaster </p> <p><strong> Forms of honesty</strong><br> </p> <p>There's something grating about the way some conflicts carry on way past the time when they actually meant anything. Carol Rumens's letter (September 25) about Lee Harwood is typical. I didn't see anything in Mark Ford's review that said Larkin was somehow a \"bad\" poet as compared with Harwood, just a rather \"embarrassed\" one. And I don't see why it's not possible for poets to get along without this \"mainstream-vs-avant garde\" nonsense. Admittedly, I'm one of those who prefer Harwood's openness to Larkin's self-deprecating irony, but they are both in their way forms of honesty. <br> <strong> Steven Waling</strong> <br> Manchester  </p> <p><strong> Honour where it's due</strong> </p> <p>DJ Taylor (\"Notes and queries\", September 25), accuses my new book The English Novel: An Introduction of awarding English novelists marks for ideological correctness. On the contrary, I award them marks for ideological incorrectness. The finest fiction of the English 20th century, the book claims, came from the far right, not from the left - and it was, I write, \"great art because of (its) dreadful politics\". The book also lavishes high praise on the conservatives Fielding, Sterne, Austen and Scott, not to speak of the virulently right-wing Conrad, the upper-class Woolf and a number of other such magnificent non-Marxists. It even finds it in its old socialist heart to laud the racist, sexist DH Lawrence, which is more than soggy liberals like DJ Taylor do. Can he be reading my book through ideological blinkers?<br> <strong> Terry Eagleton</strong><br> Dublin </p> <p> <strong> Back in the old DDR</strong> </p> <p>It's a pity that James Fenton's recognition of Rammstein's work (\"Heavy metal motherlode\", September 25), only came about after their work was filtered through \"high art\" intermediates. The group are worthy enough to be appreciated on their own terms. Rammstein's singer Till Lindemann is a published poet and the group's music fits neatly within the German romantic tradition. Their defiant Germanness (or DDR-ness?) is refreshing in these days of manufactured American or Euro pap.<br> <strong> Theo van de Bilt</strong><br> Sawbridgeworth, Herts </p> <p><strong> Playing Possum</strong><br> </p> <p>Although it is interesting to read John Mullan's account (\"Style council\", September 25), of TS Eliot's use of steady sellers on the Faber and Faber list to cross-subsidise works of literary modernism, he does not mention one product of this system, After Strange Gods, Eliot's suppressed 1934 record of lectures given to no doubt segregated audiences at the University of Virginia. This book followed on from his better-known \"Tradition and the Individual Talent\" to enunciate the conditions necessary for the survival of tradition: \"What is still more important is unity of religious background and reasons of race and religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable\". While allowances are generally made for the clubby anti-semitism of the day (though this diminishes the work of those who disdained it), Ezra Pound did not call Eliot \"Old Possum\" for nothing: when it attracts unwanted attention, a possum pretends to be dead, an act which fooled the literary establishment during Eliot's lifetime.<br> <strong> DBC Reed</strong><br> Thorplands, Northampton  </p> <p><strong> Wrong method</strong> </p> <p>The more I read of theatre directors trying to justify their methodologies ( \"Acting Out\", September 25), the more convinced I become that my decision to stay away from British theatre is the right one.<br> <strong> Andrew Tidmarsh </strong><br> London </p> <p><strong> Mores the pity</strong><br> </p> <p>Check your Latin, John Mullan (\"Great by association\", September 25): \"mores hominum multorum\" is \"the customs of many men\", not \"the many customs of men\".

  "<p>The Chequebook and the Cruise Missile: Conversations with Arundhati Roy (Harper Perennial, \u00a38.99) </p> <p>Roy argues that her Booker prize-winning novel The God of Small Things was just as political as this series of interviews; just as she has always aimed to connect the very smallest to the very biggest, to show \"how history and politics intrude into your life, your house, your bedroom ... to create links, to join the dots, to tell politics like a story\". Her conversations with journalist David Barsamian bring Roy's clarity and lyricism to an analysis of new forms of imperialism and the globalisation of dissent. The chequebook represents Argentina's collapse, the cruise missile Iraq's: they are connected, Roy argues, through US-dominated attempts to force open and control global markets. Whether discussing hydroelectrics or call centres, the stories told in these four lengthy interviews are sparky and knowledgeable: not for nothing has Roy become a goddess of the global justice movement. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p> <strong> Where I Was From, by Joan Didion (Harper Perennial, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>California, of course. Or rather, a sequence of Californias, each of which was an imagined construct that in fact changed the landscape - the dams built to store the water in which to grow the rice that Americans didn't eat and Japanese wouldn't import, the pioneer ranches subsectioned into unreal estate to house the workers for the aerospace industry that serviced military fantasies ... Didion's voice is less incantatory than it was when she \"wrote herself a Californian river\" in her first novel, Run River . She's more prepared to challenge her own false memories as well as everyone else's. There are the familiars of her writing - rattlesnakes, Patty Hearst, the Donner party wagon train; and then there is the unfamiliar death of her mother, from which no moving-on is possible, not even for a native Californian. \"There is no real way to deal with everything we lose.\" <strong>A Writer's World: Travels 1950-2000 by Jan Morris (Faber, \u00a39.99)</strong> </p> <p> \"I am by nature an outsider, by profession an onlooker, by inclination a loner,\" Jan Morris declares as she looks back over 50 years of travelling. During that time she has brought her distinctive style of detached curiosity to bear on some of the defining events of the century, from her first journalistic scoop on the ascent of Everest, to an eyewitness account of Eichmann's trial, and the British empire's final curtain in Hong Kong. But even as she records these seismic moments, her eye is drawn to the \"flash of underlife\" - the swarm of child thieves on Rio's streets, the inscrutable Aborigines living in the crimson shadow of Ayers Rock, the angry swagger of youths in Soweto townships - that reveals the true character of time or place. Morris's prose adapts itself to the unique contours of each city. In an age in which we travel to \"find ourselves\", this collection reminds us of the value of elsewhere. <strong>LB</strong></p> <p><strong> Our Final Century, by Martin Rees (Arrow, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>Grey goo. Giant waves wiping out western Europe. Trouble-makers releasing designer viruses. \"Stranglets\" ripping the very fabric of space ... One for panic junkies and amateur futurologists alike, Sir Martin Rees's book runs through a variety of ways in which we might all be doomed. Surveying current thinking across a range of scientific fields, the chapters vary in sophistication; as expected from the astronomer royal, those on cosmology are the most interesting, presenting their mind-bending possibilities with poetical lucidity. When not considering moves to Mars, parallel universes or the threat of asteroids, Rees is clear on what he sees as our present dangers: bioterror, global warming and overpopulation, making the possibility of this being \"our final century\" a very real one. Consequently, he lambasts society's short-termism (comically exemplified by the fact that in the US this book is published as Our Final Hour ). <strong> JL</strong> </p> <p><strong> Signs &amp; Wonders, by Marina Warner (Vintage, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p>This is a cabinet of curiosities, literary niches for the display of peculiarities - a Madonna statue in Pantano, Italy, that dried its tears once it had a fundraising website; the shifting, difficult life of Indian Warner of Trinidad, who might have been a beloved slave or disavowed son of a liaison between the governor and a Carib. It is rich with rum, bananas and sex (a terrific critique of the other Madonna); and money - an inquiry into the relationship of the felled Twin Towers of New York with the legendary snake-entwined Pillars of Hercules at the mouth of the Mediterranean, by way of pieces of eight and the dollar sign; and it takes in Dante and parrots, too. The essay of veneration to King Kong - primevally magnificent onscreen, offscreen 18 inches high and covered in rabbit fur - balances cinema racism, beastism and Shakespeare studies. As ever with Warner, my gob was robustly, repeatedly smacked. <strong> VR</strong> </p> <p><strong>Atlantic Britain, by Adam Nicolson (Harper Perennial, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>While some men splash out on motorbikes, Nicolson responds to his mid-life crisis by buying a boat and plunging heart-first into a passionate affair with the sea. In the company of his stalwart skipper George, he embarks on a voyage around western Britain. Nicolson is invigorated and intoxicated by the boundless possibilities of his quest. More than just an adrenaline-lashed yarn of physical survival, this is also a spiritual and emotional odyssey. By the time Nicolson abandons George to complete the homeward stretch of the journey alone, it is clear that he has failed the real test of seamanship: \"Come on, Adam, help me. Don't just keep saying how fantastic the waves are.\" Luckily for the reader, the qualities that make Nicolson an infuriating crew-member and a difficult husband also make for buoyant and lyrical prose, resulting in a shimmering - and surprisingly vulnerable - testimonial to the allure of the sea. LB</p>",
  "<p>Ever since Vladimir Nabokov published his lovely, sad, ruthless and very funny novel Pnin, the beginning of term has been a staple scene in the campus novel. \"The 1954 Fall term had begun... Again in the margins of library books earnest freshmen inscribed such helpful glosses as 'Description of nature', or 'Irony'; and in a pretty edition of Mallarm\u00e9's poems an especially able scholiast had already underlined in violet ink the difficult word oiseaux and scrawled above it 'birds'.\"</p> <p>The details of the scene change; the first paragraph of Don DeLillo's White Noise , for instance, is saturated with late 20th-century excess: \"The station wagons arrived at noon, a long shining line that coursed through the West campus... students sprang out and raced to the rear doors to begin removing the objects inside...\" Or, as Malcolm Bradbury put it in the first line of The History Man: \"Now it is autumn again; the people are all coming back.\"</p> <p>This academic year begins with Tom Wolfe's latest attempt to characterise an age. And despite those who believe that, while university life will continue, the novel of academia has had its day, Wolfe has chosen a campus novel - I am Charlotte Simmons, 600 pages set at a moneyed college on the eastern seaboard - with which to do it.</p> <p>From a practical point of view, of course, the attractions of the campus haven't changed much: it is a finite, enclosed space, like a boarding school, or like Agatha Christie's country-houses (the campus murder mystery being its own respectable sub-genre); academic terms, usefully, begin and end; there are clear power relationships (teacher/student; tenured professor/scrabbling lecturer) - and thus lots of scope for illicit affairs; circumscription forces a greater intensity - revolutions have been known to begin on campuses, though that doesn't seem to have happened for a while. And it's all set against the life of the mind.</p> <p>\"The high ideals of the university as an institution - the pursuit of knowledge and truth,\" says David Lodge, author of some of the more popular campus novels of the last century, \"are set against the actual behaviour and motivations of the people who work in them, who are only human and subject to the same ignoble desires and selfish ambitions as anybody else. The contrast is perhaps more ironic, more marked, than it would be in any other professional milieu.\"</p> <p>The campus novel began in America, with Mary McCarthy's The Groves of Academe (1952), Randall Jarrell's reply to it, Pictures From an Institution (1954), and Pnin (1955). (Nabokov's Pale Fire is, inter alia, a campus novel, and a murder-mystery.) \"Campus\" is, of course, an American word, and Lodge makes the distinction between the campus novel and the varsity novel - the latter being set at Oxbridge, and usually among students, rather than teachers, thus disallowing the joys of Zuleika Dobson, or Jill, or Brideshead Revisited; he claims Kingsley Amis's Lucky Jim (1954) as the first British campus novel, and a template.</p> <p>To all the standard elements, Lodge explains, Amis added \"the English comic novel tradition, which goes back through Evelyn Waugh and Dickens to Fielding\"; ie, an element of robust farce later elaborated by Tom Sharpe in Porterhouse Blue, for example, or by Howard Jacobson.</p> <p>\"I don't see why the campus novel has to consist of farce,\" says AS Byatt, who dislikes Lucky Jim, seeing it as both sexist and thoroughly anti-intellectual. \"I find it baffling.\" She has much more time for what she calls true comedy, in Terry Pratchett's Unseen University, or in Lodge's Nice Work (1988), which she feels have more respect for a profession based on serious thought.</p> <p>This is an older tradition, again. \"I compare it to pastoral,\" says Lodge. \"If you think of a comedy such as As You Like It, you get all these eccentric characters, all in one pastoral place, interacting in ways they wouldn't be able to do if they were part of a larger, more complex social scene. There's often an element of entertaining artifice, of escape from the everyday world, in the campus novel. Quite interesting issues are discussed, but not in a way which is terribly solemn or portentous.\"</p> <p>The other, probably inevitable, addition was class. Much of the tension in Lucky Jim is between Jim Dixon and his socially superior boss; apart from the fact that she's simply prettier, the thing that binds Jim to his eventual girlfriend, Christine, is their mutual recognition of a kind of aggressive gaucheness, assumed to be more authentic than the baying, madrigal-singing Welches. But it's a fruitful collision nonetheless.</p> <p>\"If you're interested in the phenomenon of meritocracy, which transformed English society in the postwar period, then the university is - or was - a good place to observe it,\" says Lodge, who like many of his colleagues in the 60s and 70s was a first-generation university graduate. \"The Kirks are, indeed, new people,\" wrote Bradbury in The History Man, which was published in the same year, 1975, as Lodge's Changing Places. \"But where some people are born new people... the Kirks arrived at that condition the harder way, by effort, mobility and harsh experience.\"</p> <p>These two seminal English campus novels are set in and immediately after \"the heroic period of student politics\", to quote Lodge's Nice Work, when new universities seemed to be appearing all over the country, change seemed possible, social mobility achievable, and promiscuity mandatory - the necessary mixing and mating of comedy, or farce, meshing nicely with the burgeoning sexual revolution and women's lib. And even though Bradbury's novel especially has a great sense of darkness, pointing, among other things, to the inequalities of unfettered sexuality at that point in time, both now read as historical novels, imbued with a quixotic hope.</p> <p>But in English higher education everything is set, even in celebration, against Oxbridge, says Ian Carter, author of Ancient Cultures of Conceit: British University Fiction in the Post War Years (1990), and a professor at the University of Auckland, citing those who made the conscious choice to go to Sussex, for example, instead. The American campus novel was, he feels, better able to avoid the trap of class, \"perhaps because American universities are so highly differentiated, so recognisably placeable; novels could take on a larger variety of themes without automatically having to deal with class.\"</p> <p>Though the oil crisis of 1973 was the beginning of the end of the boom in new universities, Thatcher prompted the next great satirical subject: Lodge cites Andrew Davies's A Very Peculiar Practice, and his own Nice Work transfers the contrapuntal, mutually illuminating UK university versus US university structure of Changing Places to UK university versus UK capitalist industry.</p> <p>A concurrent subject was the rise of literary theory, gently skewered in Robyn Penrose, standing for the university side of Nice Work (she is a devotee of \"semiotic materialism\" who believes there is no such thing as the \"self\", though \"in practice this doesn't seem to affect her very noticeably [so] I shall therefore take the liberty of treating her as a character\"). John Mullan, lecturer in English at University College London, who has written, in these pages, that the English campus novel is a fossil form, says \"nobody notices, but AS Byatt's Possession [1990] is an extremely acid attack on feminist literary criticism.\"</p> <p>So, as the university changed, British campus novels were changing in tone - angry, coruscating, debunking, or, in the case of Michael Frayn's haunting The Trick of It (1989), melancholy; and the younger generation of novelists - Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, Ian McEwan - weren't writing them. \"It might be that the clutch of books that appeared in the 70s and 80s were to do with the fact that we were about to see a world vanish, maybe they were all elegies to an idea of the campus,\" says Howard Jacobson. \"My novel [Coming From Behind, a \"rotten poly\" satire published in 1983] came towards the end of it - and was in a way a parody of what was already a parody, since my campus wasn't even a campus.\"</p> <p>Jacobson argues that fear of elitism put paid to the campus novel. \"Although half the country goes to campuses... everybody is embarrassed to talk about it. I think once democracy got going on the English novel, and we felt we didn't want to write anything that might upset anybody or make them feel out of it, that was the end of the campus novel. I miss it. And also, of course, campus novels were, by their very nature, funny, and funny is not in either. Campuses have become tragic places. Maybe that's all it is. They're pure wastelands, really.\"</p> <p>\"Universities are depressed,\" says Byatt. When institutions such as the University of East Anglia were built everything was \"shiny, white and new,\" and because \"in those days universities were intensely hopeful\" you could afford farce, because \"you had a solidity. Now they're terrified and cowering and underfinanced and overexamined and overbureaucratised.\"</p> <p>Not everyone shares this bleak view. Lodge, for one, published a new campus novel, Thinks... in 2001, and says \"There's a tendency for people to sneer at the genre as if it's played out, while actually they take a good deal of interest in reading it. The fact is that universities change and societies change, and therefore there are always new fictional possibilities.\"</p> <p>Laurie Taylor, who for 27 years has written a satirical column about universities for the Times Higher Education Supplement (and was rumoured to be the model for Howard Kirk in The History Man), concurs. This week he judged a competition for the THES that asked for the first chapter of a new campus novel. The entries were \"full of campuses in which management experts and management gurus and development leaders, all speaking management jargon, are locked in a battle with the few people left who still believe that there's something more to universities than providing people with degrees that enable them to get jobs.\"</p> <p>For this is the major battle still being fought, first joined under Thatcher, and continued under Blair: \"the campus is now a site for a clash between two pretty fundamental values\": the instrumental and the intrinsic, auditors versus intellectuals. Taylor cites a novel he recently reviewed, Academia Nuts, by Michael Wilding (2002), \"which is very clever, in the grand tradition of Lucky Jim - but all about the impossibility of writing campus novels any more.\"</p> <p>' \"This\", said Henry. \"All this.\" There it was, their world lay all before them. The deserted common room. The chipped cups. The worn, unfigured carpet. \"There's not an awful lot here,\" said Pawley. \"I think you need more than the common room.\" \"The university as such,\" said Henry. \"You'd better hurry,\" said Pawley. \"It's all being out-sourced. There's hardly anything left. The virtual university. No tenured staff. No gross moral turpitude.\" \"I shall write about the university in decline,\" said Henry. \"I think you might have left it too late,\" said Dr Bee.'</p> <p>So \"there are still plenty of laughs,\" says Taylor, \"even though the laughter is now bitter instead of affectionate.\" But Academia Nuts is also Australian, and it is instructive to look away from England to see how the patient is really faring. Canada had Robertson Davies, now dead, and more recently Jeffrey Moore, who won the Commonwealth Best First Book award with a campus novel, Red-Rose Chain, in 2000; JM Coetzee's fierce, brilliant Disgrace (1999) is set in motion by the narrator's misdemeanors on a campus in Cape Town.</p> <p>Europe never had very many, though All Souls, by Javier Marias, is \"wonderful\", says Byatt; in order to write a good campus novel you have to have been a university teacher, says Lodge, and in Europe that would be a betrayal of professional dignity. But in America the genre seems to have grown in stature, mutating into something important, and relevant. The increasing ubiquity of the university education is as true there as it is here (as David Mamet put it in Oleanna, \"college education, since the war, has become so much a matter of course, and such a fashionable necessity... that we espouse it as a matter of right, and have ceased to ask 'What is it good for'?\") and ensures a large audience less hamstrung than the British by class-consciousness.</p> <p>The English department continues to provide great fodder (for Richard Russo, for example) but one of the more obvious trends has been the rise of novels satirising creative writing courses, such as Wonder Boys, by Michael Chabon. \"It's like shooting fish in a barrel,\" laughs Francine Prose, whose National Book Award-nominated Blue Angel updates the Marlene Dietrich movie, placing it in a creative writing course in a tiny college in northern Vermont. \"The minute they started allowing writers on campus they were in trouble\"; of course they were going to start mocking the day job.</p> <p>\"Where is the novel we ought to have, about science departments?\" wonders Byatt, who frankly wishes that English departments, wallowing in self-referentiality, could be discontinued; Lodge's Thinks... again of contrapuntal, bipartite structure, plays a novelist teaching a creative writing course off against a cognitive scientist; the usual farcical bed-hopping ensues, but it's a knowing nod to the genre in what is mainly a serious exploration of the nature of consciousness and the limits of AI.</p> <p>This, too, is a trend established in the US, by writers such as Jonathan Lethem, whose As She Climbed Across the Table is about a physicist who discovers a hole in the universe, and a sociologist who studies academic environments; or by Richard Powers, who in Galatea 2.2 has a cognitive neurologist train a neural net to pass a course on Great Books.</p> <p>Francine Prose set out to write a novel of obsessive love and ambition, \"and somehow the campus seemed the perfect way to talk about those things\". This seems a general discovery: White Noise, 20 years old now, is, as well as a study of the threats, and the seductive promises of science, and a celebration of family, a sustained and darkly funny engagement with the idea of death; Donna Tartt's bestseller The Secret History (also a campus thriller) takes the influence tutors have over their nubile charges to violent extremes. Power is so clearly demarcated on campus, and, increasingly, so easy to lose.</p> <p>The great novel about this - though it is great about nearly everything - is Philip Roth's The Human Stain. Coleman Silk, professor of classics, is also dean when he utters one inadvisable word, \"spooks\"; the tumbrils of politically correct outrage roll, and he loses his job. (One of the central ironies of the book is that he is African-American, passing as white.) In the controlled space of the campus he has been king, overhauling departments, sweeping them clean, but in a word he has been forced into exile.</p> <p>Exile is, in the late 20th century, itself almost a fossilised concept: where, centuries ago, you might be forced to leave a village as punishment, how many communities now are close-knit enough to function in this way? The campus, especially highly differentiated, self-sufficient American campuses such as Coleman Silk's in sleepy New England, is our alternative; banishment is no less keenly felt. And it nearly drives Silk mad.</p> <p>Political correctness never made much headway on British campuses, and in fact, says Alexander Star, who edited Lingua Franca, the magazine of American academia, until it folded three years ago, the worst has been over in the US for a while now. The animating anger of The Human Stain is, therefore, dated. But it doesn't matter. For in pc, and in literary theory, and on a modern campus, Roth found a way to address some of the big cultural questions of the later 20th century.</p> <p>Silk's nemesis is a young French academic called Delphine, bright, ambitious, a mistress of theory. She is also far from home, and lonely, and increasingly \"destabilised to the point of shame by the discrepancy between how she must deal with literature in order to succeed professionally and why she first came to literature\": that instrumental v intrinsic argument rearing its head again.</p> <p>The dichotomy, for Roth, is clear: ideology is the enemy of humanism, of the human; ideology is fascism, communism - is political correctness. And so, in America at least, the campus novel has become a way to measure the state of the nation. It has taken on the elements of classical tragedy, but it is still amusing, albeit often bleakly so. No wonder Tom Wolfe wants to join in the fun.</p>",
  "<p>One of the by-products of looking through archives is a kind of artificial clairvoyance: you know what is going to happen next. Sandwiched between some loose papers in the archives of the British photographer Tony Ray-Jones at the Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television in Bradford was a page from one of those old-fashioned desk calendars, the sort that gets torn off as each day goes by. A large red figure eight and the full date, 7/8/64, Wednesday July 8 1964; the reversed day and month indicated America. On the flip side were a few scribbled notes about how best to expose Pan-X film \"for detail\". Most of the other sheets contained lists, scribbled in swift capitals: \"Some Story Ideas: Sunnyside Colony, Queens (German folk dancing etc), Festival of Flowers (call Buddhist temple), Gypsies and Gypsy weddings, Abyssinian Church Uptown - Fashion show (negro audience), People trapped in small environment - elevators (before door closes), Invisible people - shoe-shiners in Gnd Central, Women who live out of bags, People in Supermarkets - stop them and shoot yell stop. Bus terminals - Make people automatons.\" </p> <p>Among \"some places to photograph\" were Idlewild airport, Fulton fish market on the Lower East Side, East Harlem, Chinatown, St Christopher's Arena \"midgets backstage\", Central Park and Coney Island. It was the hectic schedule of a young British photographer in his first year in New York. The lists aren't dated, but they must have been made before the end of 1963, when Idlewild airport was renamed to commemorate the death of John F Kennedy. By this time Ray-Jones would have been in America for two years, studying for a Master of Fine Arts in graphic design at Yale. After graduating in the summer of 1964, he found a short-lived job as an art director at CBS records, but he was determined to become a photographer. The country he had left behind was still recovering from the second world war, but New York was buzzing with newness. He kept his programme for the US premiere of Stockhausen's Originale in September 1964 at the Judson Hall, with \"action music\" by the artist Nam June Paik and poetry by Allen Ginsberg, just as he kept scraps of paper on which he'd jotted down music stores offering cheap deals on jazz: 50 cents off Horace Silver's Blowin' The Blues Away at Sam Goody's, a dollar off Ray Charles on Atlantic at Korvette's, half-price Blue Note albums at Kenny's. </p> <p>\"You know, Tony loved America intensely, and he loved it for its music,\" Joel Meyerowitz said. \"He was feverish about music and photography. But he was very English about it, always muttering a lot, 'We've got to keep working ...' He was incredibly impatient.\" </p> <p>Meyerowitz is now one of America's most famous photographic artists, but 40 years ago he spent two years of intense friendship with Ray-Jones, roaming the streets and taking photographs. \"Every Saturday there would be ethnic parades, St Patrick's day, Polish day, Columbus day, veterans' day. We used these parades as a laboratory. We learned to be invisible. We learned how to shape pictures that were not about an event but about an observation.\" </p> <p>The streets of New York represented fertile territory for documentary photographers, from Weegee and William Klein to Robert Frank, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Diane Arbus and Garry Winogrand - a new generation of photographers whose aim, in the words of John Szarkowski at the Museum of Modern Art, \"has been not to reform life but to know it\". Ray-Jones and Meyerowitz were fired up by what was going on around them. \"Bresson was very important to both of us,\" Meyerowitz said. \"We were in love with him, and with Robert Frank.\" And then there was Winogrand, who made \"the freest, loosest, open-ended, open-hearted, generous pictures about life\". </p> <p>\"Those were precious years,\" Meyerowitz said. \"Every day was a discovery. It was wonderful having a partner who said, 'We've got to keep working. We can't let this crap that we're producing keep us down.' We loved each other in the way that two guys on the edge of discovery love each other, and we had the raw medium between us.\" Which is why the discovery of the calendar page generated a sudden poignancy. Because with it came the realisation that on July 8 1964, Ray-Jones was a month past his 23rd birthday, burning with plans for the future, and in less than 10 years he would be dead. His photographic career spanned little more than a decade. His five years in America were followed by five more in England, from 1966 to 1971. There was a brief return to America, teaching in San Francisco, before he fell ill and returned to London, where he died of leukaemia in March 1972. \"There's a thing about those people,\" Meyerowitz said, \"those people who have brilliant creative minds and who died at 30. They did it in those 10 years - the clock is running and they're burning their metabolism at a certain rate. There was that sense with Tony.\" </p> <p>Ray-Jones was born in Somerset in 1941. His father, Raymond Ray-Jones, was an engraver whose work was collected in the British Museum and the V&amp;A. He died before Tony was a year old, and his mother with her three sons moved in with her parents and worked as a physiotherapist. Ray-Jones went to school at Christ's Hospital, in West Sussex, then enrolled on a graphic design course at the London School of Printing, where Rolf Brandt, Bill Brandt's brother, encouraged his photography. He left England on a scholarship for Yale in 1961 before \"the 60s\" as we know it had even begun. He came back in 1966 to find London swinging, but the rest of Britain still clearly divided by class and tradition. He left behind only one book, but his role as both inspiration and an irritant to a British photographic community which, as far as he was concerned, was barely conscious, compared with America's, ensured his place in the history of British photography. He inspired the generation that followed him to observe the society around them, as its values shifted under Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>In the summer of 1966 he came across a Country Life book of Old English Customs. The description of traditional rural pastimes excited him and he began to conceive of a book about the English. The last such subjective survey by a photographer had been Bill Brandt's The English At Home, published in 1936. It was time for an update. </p> <p>Back in London that autumn, he met Anna Coates, an art student from St Helens. They moved into a flat in Gloucester Place, where Ray-Jones built a darkroom and, amid visitors from America, including Meyerowitz, Winogrand, the jazz pianist Horace Silver, John Szarkowski, continued to develop his new project. A Day Off - An English Journal, a collection of photographs he took between 1967 and 1970, was published posthumously in 1974. </p> <p>He and Anna bought a VW camper van and started to make weekend trips. \"We drove off to the seaside, or to a festival,\" she said. \"Tony did a lot of research with the English Folklore Society, with various tourist boards, with visitors' information centres at various seaside resorts. He plotted things out. He was quite well organised.\" </p> <p>In 1964, at Yale, Ray-Jones had attended a lecture by Walker Evans, who showed not his own photographs but his collection of American postcards. Ray-Jones now began to collect postcards of England, including the rude seaside postcards by Donald McGill. He made lists of books to read, from The Butlin Story, to Veblen's The Theory Of The Leisure Class, to Jane Austen's unfinished novel, Sanditon. His calendar of upcoming events included women's bowls in Bournemouth in July, Britain's baby of the year in Blackpool in August, Carnival Week in Skegness in September. Almost every resort had a beauty contest. </p> <p>Meyerowitz was impressed by the change in his friend. \"When we met up in London in 1966, he seemed a little more rooted,\" he said. \"To me, Britain had the impoverished mentality of a postwar generation. There was a tightness and a rigidity in the culture. Tony had come back and was able to mock those mores and that lifestyle. It was perfect timing for him to return.\" </p> <p>In the mid-to-late 1960s, England's seaside resorts were filled with families taking their annual holidays. Ray-Jones captured the chaos of these groups - barefoot children wandering off down the sands, pensioners wrapped up in motley against the winds, young couples in awkward embraces, hamfisted fathers with their toddlers, chips and ice-cream and beer and litter, and everything happening at the same time in a choreography that sent the eye wandering off to the farthest edges of the picture and back again. The English seaside in black and white can be a grim place. But in the gestures of the people, Ray-Jones captured a whole range of human emotions; the lascivious tongue licking round the mouth of a spivvy-looking judge at a beauty contest in Southport; the gentle embrace of a young couple on a boat trip around Beachy Head, of which only the photographer among the rest of the holiday-makers on board seems aware; the joyless couple at Great Yarmouth, slumped under grimy fake palm trees, and, in the far left of the picture, the back of an unlit neon sign that reads JOYLAND in reverse. </p> <p>America had been a search: for a style, for a subject, for a means of self-expression that went beyond the neatly crafted magazine photograph. His most successful pictures have this strong, multilayered architecture, built up by the passage of people and events within the frame. There is a tension between control and the lack of it; between the structure of the picture and the chance encounters that undermine it. </p> <p>By 1968 he was ready to show his work to publishers, but London was not prepared. Fashion and advertising photographers were profiting from the \"youthquake\". There were new magazines and new products, particularly for teenagers and women. There were Sunday colour supplements. But most photography books (with the exception of Brandt) came from America. \"No one was putting photographs up on walls and saying 'This is Art', as they were already doing in America,\" Anna Ray-Jones said. \"And I think Tony brought that vision. But I think that was an alien view at the time, apart from a few enlightened people.\" </p> <p>Creative Camera, launched at the beginning of 1968, was dedicated to publishing personal portfolios and critical writing on photography. It was owned by Colin Osman, a photography enthusiast who owned and published Racing Pigeon magazine, and was based in his offices in Doughty Street. It was into this den of pigeon fanciers and photographers that a \"frizzy-haired guy with a Fu Manchu moustache\" walked with a yellow box under his arm and told editor Bill Jay, \"Your magazine's shit, but I can see you're trying. You just don't know enough, so I am here to help you.\" It was Tony Ray-Jones. The box contained pictures from America and for his proposed book. </p> <p>Jay was impressed by the pictures and published some of them in the October issue. He and Ray-Jones became friends and combatants in the battle to raise the British consciousness about photography. Ray-Jones insisted Jay go with him to New York, where he planned to show the dummy of his English book to American publishers. They stayed at the Chelsea Hotel, and Jay met a whole roster of American photographers, including Winogrand, Frank, Meyerowitz and Arbus. But Ray-Jones received little interest in his book. </p> <p>In the spring of 1969, some 54 of his photographs - entitled The English Seen - made up part of a group show of four photographers, Ray-Jones, Enzo Ragazzini, Dorothy Bohm and Don McCullin, at the ICA. It was the first photography exhibition the institute had held. Sue Davies, who two years later founded the Photographers' Gallery in London, was working there at the time. \"Everybody in the ICA thought photography was naff. But after that hundreds of people came. It was so refreshing. Most of the stuff at the ICA had been very esoteric, quite elitist, quite hard. Then other photographers came, asking, 'Can you show my work?' That's really what inspired me to think of starting a place for professional photographers to show their work properly.\" </p> <p>By the time of the ICA show, Ray-Jones had a more subtle understanding of his subject: \"I have tried to show the sadness and the humour in a gentle madness that prevails in a people. The situations are sometimes ambiguous and unreal, and the juxtaposition of elements seemingly unrelated, and yet the people are real. This, I hope, helps to create a feeling of fantasy. Photography can be a mirror and reflect life as it is, but I also think that perhaps it is possible to walk, like Alice, through a Looking Glass, and find another kind of world with the camera.\" </p> <p>In 1970 he was offered a teaching job at the San Francisco Art Institute. He needed \"an American breather\", his wife said, and they left for the west in 1971. He found teaching frustrating, but worked hard on stories for both American and British magazines, and experimented with colour for his own work. \"We had intended to move to Los Angeles because Tony decided he wanted to go into films,\" Anna Ray-Jones explained. \"I don't know what this transition would have really been like, but he decided he would study cinematography, and he was admitted to the Cal-Arts, into the school of cinema there. He became ill at the end of 1971 and it was apparent that something was very wrong. So it put the kibosh on all kinds of plans. And then he had to come home.\" He flew back to London on March 10 1972 and died three days later. </p> <p>Last summer in Arles, Martin Parr, a guest curator of the photography festival there, showed a small group of Ray-Jones prints, a preview of a much larger exhibition that opens, accompanied by a new book, at the Bradford musem later this month. More than any other photographer in the generation that followed Ray-Jones, Parr's work reflects his influence. He first saw Ray-Jones's photographs in 1970, when Bill Jay gave a lecture at Manchester Polytechnic, where Parr was a student. \"His pictures were about England. They had that contrast, that seedy eccentricity, but they showed it in a very subtle way. They have an ambiguity, a visual anarchy. They showed me what was possible.\" </p> <p>The recent history of photography in Britain is still being compiled and argued over. There is no doubt as to Ray-Jones's influence on the development of what came to be called \"independent\" British photography during the 1970s, but the degree of its importance is debated. To Jay, \"He galvanised a lot of young photographers. A myth was created about the 'independent artist'. It was created by people coming out of art colleges, absorbing the aura of the pure artist. You can exaggerate Tony's influence. The fact is that he wasn't there.\" For David Hurn, a Magnum photographer and a friend of Jay and Ray-Jones, the \"myth that has grown up, that Tony brought American photography to Britain [is] nonsense. These people were known about. I had a big flat in Bayswater. By the mid-1960s Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander, Winogrand, had all been to stay. The idea that photography in Britain wouldn't have happened without Tony is wrong.\" </p> <p>But from an American perspective, Britain lacked an original voice in photography during that period, and Ray-Jones stood out. \"There semed to be no precedent in England for work like that,\" John Szarkowski wrote, in answer to an email. \"Of course everyone in my country knew and revered Brandt, and respected Roger Mayne, but the surprising thing about Ray-Jones was that he had a different idea of what subject matter was possible for serious photography. It did not have to be heroic or poetic in any overt sense: it could be on the surface as tedious or as bland as our real tedious and bland lives usually are, and the photographs might still be compelling.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tony Ray-Jones, by Russell Roberts, is published by Boot at \u00a329.95. A Gentle Madness: The Photographs Of Tony Ray-Jones (1941-72) opens at the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television in Bradford on October 15. A one-day conference, What Happened Here, Photography In Britain Since 1968, will be held at the NMPFT on October 14.
