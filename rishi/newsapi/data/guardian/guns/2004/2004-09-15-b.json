  "<p> Real Madrid suffered a humiliating defeat last night that will cast a long shadow over their attempts to regain their pre-eminence in the Champions League. Three goals from the German side left a full-strength Real side - gal\u00e1cticos and all - for dead in front of more than 22,000 people in this industrial corner of north-west Germany. </p> <p>The Madrid coach Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho blamed himself. \"I take responsibility for this because I was obviously not able to make sure my players approached this game with the right attitude,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We were outplayed for 60 minutes. They were the better team.\" </p> <p>Leverkusen seized on this opportunity to avenge their 2-1 defeat by Madrid in the 2002 Champions League final in dramatic style. </p> <p>The first chance of the match fell to the home side with a header from the midfielder Paul Freier. Madrid's best chance of the first half fell to Ronaldo on 26 minutes, when he connected with a cross from Michel Salgado, but the Brazilian fired against the bar from close range. </p> <p>Leverkusen then established their control, although it took them nearly 40 minutes to capitalise on the possession and set pieces they were enjoying. The Polish midfielder Jacek Krzynowek scored the goal his industrious performance warranted after a corner was poorly cleared and the left-sided player hit a glorious long-range shot which hit the post and went in off the Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas. </p> <p>In the final minutes of the first half Zin\u00e9dine Zidane jumped into a challenge with the Leverkusen defender Roque Junior and sustained a dislocated right shoulder. The French midfielder, who retired from international football in the summer to concentrate on playing for Madrid, was replaced by the striker Fernando Morientes at half-time and is almost certain to miss Real's next Champions League game at home to Roma on September 28. </p> <p>After the interval the Brazilian forward Franca doubled Leverkusen's lead when David Beckham gave him too much space on the edge of the box and he powered the ball past the flailing arms of Casillas. </p> <p>Only nine minutes later Leverkusen's pressure paid dividends again when the striker Dimitar Berbatov made it three with the easiest of opportunities after the defender Francisco Pav\u00f3n could get only a touch on Franca's left-wing cross. The ball ballooned in the air and the Bulgarian striker tapped the ball into the empty net. </p> <p>Madrid's efforts were restricted to long-range shots and their frustration resulted in bookings for Pav\u00f3n and Morientes. </p> <p>Real, who have won only once in 19 visits to Germany, looked vulnerable throughout. Michael Owen stayed on the bench but the form displayed by Ronaldo and Raul suggested he may soon win a place in the starting line-up. </p>",
  "<p>Control cholesterol and lower heart disease with help from flower power. Scientists in Taiwan tested hibiscus flower extract on laboratory rats. </p> <p>They report in the Journal of the Science of Food in Agriculture that extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa significantly lowered the cholesterol content in blood serum and successfully prevented oxidation of low-density lipoprotein. So hibiscus flower joins other plant products in the arsenal of artery-preservers.</p> <p>The extract has been used in folk medicine to treat hypertension and liver disorder: it also pops up in soft drinks. So once again, the herbal healers may have been onto something. \"Experiments have shown that compounds extracted from red wine and tea reduce cholesterol and lipid build-up in the arteries of rats,\" says Chau-Jong Wang of Chung Shan Medical University. \"This is the first study to show that hibiscus extract has the same effect.\"</p>",
  "<b>Daily Star</b> <br> Editorial, Lebanon, September 15 <p>\"The bombings in Iraq on Tuesday that killed some 60 people and wounded hundreds will neither liberate Iraq from foreign occupation nor bring back the former Ba'athist regime. This kind of large-scale slaughter of Iraqis, whether carried out by other Iraqis or foreign terrorists, is a macabre form of national self-mutilation ... </p> <p>\"Is this the political ghost of the former Ba'athist regime, a sort of invisible Saddam Hussein using the same murderous tactics that defined his decades in power? If former Ba'athists are among those who are orchestrating these attacks, what do they want to achieve? They cannot possibly expect their fellow citizens to get so disenchanted with the current situation that they would ask the Ba'athists to return to power and restore order ...

There has been talk of excluding towns that remain outside government control. As things stand, that would tend to disenfranchise the Sunni triangle, the region that, above all, needs to be integrated into the new Iraq. A Sunni heartland shut out of the democratic process would be a prime source of instability.\" </p> <p><b>Arab News</b><br> Editorial, Saudi Arabia, September 15  </p> <p>\"The men of violence ... see the government [of Ayad Allawi] as invalid because it is a creation of the American-led invasion and occupation. Everything that is a product of the administration's drive for peace and normality, from the restoration of oil exports and power supplies to the enforcement of law and order, is associated with Washington's policy and the assumed desire to dominate the Arab country which has the world's second largest oil and gas reserves ... </p> <p>\"The shadowy men of violence grow ever stronger. It is an alarming fact that with only one insurgent group, Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army, is there any known figurehead with whom negotiations can take place.

  "Iraq security forces yesterday discovered the beheaded bodies of three men, believed to be Arabs and possibly Iraqis, dumped by a roadside north of Baghdad. <p>There was no identification on the bodies, although two had old tattoos in Roman letters and one had a tattoo in Arabic script. Each was clothed and had been placed in a nylon bag, with their heads strapped to their backs. </p> <p>Dozens of Jordanian, Egyptian, Kuwaiti and Turkish truck drivers have been kidnapped on roads north of the capital in recent months, often by Islamist militant groups operating from the insurgent town of Falluja. Several of the hostages have been released, in some cases after ransoms have been paid, but many others have been beheaded. </p> <p>Iraqi national guards found the bodies near Dujail, 40 miles north of Baghdad and close to Samarra, a known insurgent stronghold. The US military said the bodies were Arab and may have been local. </p> <p>Several western hostages are still being held, including two French journalists and two Italian aid workers. </p> <p>Yesterday a Jordanian haulage firm became the latest to announce it was stopping its work in Iraq in an attempt to win the freedom of a kidnapped driver. An Islamist militant group calling itself the Lions of the Monotheism Brigade released a video earlier this week showing Khalifa al-Breizat, and threatening to kill him unless the firm stopped work within 48 hours. </p> <p>\"We've pulled back all our trucks, and we are not sending any into Iraq,\" Ibrahim Zog-haby, an official from the firm, told al-Jazeera TV. \"We've stopped all work there.\" He did not name his company, but said it delivered oil derivatives and water from Jordan to Iraq. </p> <p>Another video message, obtained by the Associated Press yesterday, showed a Turkish translator being released. \"Today the mojahedin released me and I will go to the embassy,\" said the man, identified as Aytulla Gezmen. He was shown standing next to a masked man before getting into a car. </p> <p>A video message said he was being freed because he had converted to Islam and \"repented for working with the infidel American occupation forces\". His family said he had phoned home to Turkey saying he was safe and would be returning within days. </p> <p>Kidnapping has become an ever more sophisticated operation in Iraq. The groups involved often use different names, but they appear to be centred around the Islamist insurgency based in Falluja and the nearby towns of Ramadi and Samarra. </p> <p>The US military has struggled to assert any control over the area, and appears to be suggesting once more that a large-scale offensive may be needed to wrest back control, despite the political damage that would do. </p> <p>The latest upsurge in violence that has claimed at least 200 lives in four days showed no signs of abating yesterday. Ten people, including two women, were killed in fighting between US troops and insurgents in Ramadi, the Iraqi health ministry said. </p> <p>A car bomb hit an Iraqi national guard checkpoint in Suwayra, south of Baghdad, killing two and wounding 10. </p> <p>In Tehran, Iran's foreign ministry summoned the Iraqi ambassador to protest against the killing on Sunday of an Iranian in Kerbala. Labib Mohammadi was working for Iran's pilgrimage organisation, helping the thousands who travel to Iraq each year. Iran's consul in Kerbala was kidnapped several weeks ago and is still being held.</p>",
  "Prior to September 2002 the peacock butterflies did not regularly breed this far north, but quite often turned up as wanderers. Then there was an invasion of them between September 11 and 13, and there were subsequent sightings through to the end of the month. Weather systems suggest they came from the continent, but whatever the source, they were seen throughout the coastal part of Inverness and Moray. Some filtered inland down the Great Glen and Glenmore in Speyside. There were more than 70 sightings of peacocks in these areas, more than all the previous sightings for the areas put together. Special searches were made that winter for hibernating peacocks to no avail, but they were in the same areas the following year. <p>The success of the invasion can be measured by the numbers reported in gardens and the countryside in the last two weeks. This is why, in the second week of September, we counted at least 20 peacocks on one buddleia in our garden. The masses of blossoms are a deep rich purple, with sometimes two or three butterflies on one long, dense spike of richly scented flowers. No accurate count could be made as there were always restless individuals, disturbed by red admirals or bumblebees, and they flitted around, sometimes resting on nearby trees or the white garden seat nearby. When landing the wings are initially folded and the butterfly seems to disappear thanks to such superb camouflage. Then the wings flutter and, if not disturbed, the wings are lowered and even drooped, as if the nectar is taking control of the butterfly's senses. The beautiful \"eye\" markings on the wings no doubt deter predators.</p>",
  "<b> Financial Times </b> <br> Editorial, September 14 <p> \"President Vladimir Putin [on Monday] took a chainsaw to the fragile roots of Russian democracy. In announcing plans to reduce the independence of regional governors and the national parliament he claimed to be trying to strengthen Russia's defences against terrorism. In truth, he was doing nothing of the kind. He was simply exploiting the Beslan massacre to seize new powers for the Kremlin ... </p> <p>\"Some consolidation of power was necessary after Boris Yeltsin's chaotic rule. The central state was almost bankrupt and its officials demoralised. But the Kremlin is going too far: the legitimate recovery of political authority is turning into the creation of a new form of authoritarian rule ... Mr Putin must go no further down the dangerous road of authoritarianism ... Authoritarian rulers are particularly bad at solving complex political issues such as Chechnya.\" </p> <p><b> Vedomosti</b><br> Editorial, Russia, September 14 </p> <p> \"The shift from direct elections [for regional governors] to a two-level system [of appointment] is a backward step from a democratic point of view. The people are being stripped of a voting right ... They are being deprived of it because 'we live in conditions which don't correspond with the current state of society's political development'. </p> <p>\"The Kremlin's intention to deprive not only Russians, but also other ethnicities living within the country, of their right to elect a regional leader is unlikely to receive the backing of the international community whose support is important in the battle against terrorism.\" </p> <p><b> Kommersant</b><br> Editorial, Russia, September 14 </p> <p> \"Mr Putin confessed in essence that the decision to strengthen 'vertical power' taken by the Kremlin as long ago as 2000 has not produced the desired results. However, to solve new problems that the country is facing, the president has proposed the same old methods which have already proven to be ineffective: a further strengthening of central power. Then, as now, the main goals of reform were named as the strengthening of Russia's unity and an improvement of the way in which the country is governed. But [on Monday] Mr Putin admitted that a single system of power 'has not yet been set up'. </p> <p>\"It is safe to assume that the country's mayors will also soon be merely 'endorsed' by local parliamentarians and be appointed by governors. [Soon] the only person in power to have been elected by the people will be the president of Russia himself.\" </p> <p><b> Moscow Times </b><br> Editorial, September 14 </p> <p> \"Under these proposals, the Kremlin will accumulate even greater power at the expense of participatory democracy and the already enfeebled governors. It looks very much like the Kremlin's damage control strategy is to be centred around making regional leaders the scapegoats for recent failures, thereby minimising the responsibility that should properly be assumed by the central authorities, in particular by members of Mr Putin's inner circle ... </p> <p>\"The president has, of late, been emphasising the importance of a robust civil society and broader public participation in the political process for countering the terrorist threat. It is somewhat ironic, therefore, that Putin has now called for the abolition of direct gubernatorial elections - as if to say that he has no faith in the public's ability to vote for the 'right' governor.\" </p> <p><b> New York Times </b><br> Editorial, September 14 </p> <p> \"These chilling proposals have no obvious relevance to the terrorist attacks. By exploiting the nation's grief, they merely advance Mr Putin's anti-democratic agenda. Well before this crisis began, he had moved to suppress the media, marginalise opposition parties and bring crushing legal charges against business leaders who challenged his dominance. </p> <p>\"The answer to Russia's problems, including corruption and terrorism, is more democracy, not less ... A country as huge and complex as Russia cannot be run efficiently or accountably by Kremlin nominees ... Mr Putin is already responsible for Russia's stubborn refusal to deal with the political dimensions of Chechen separatism, as if punishing military offensives, puppet governments and fraudulent elections could somehow make the problem go away. It did not go away. It got worse. Today it is just as easy to see that further narrowing the scope of Russian democracy will not solve Russia's real problems. But, like all cornered autocrats, Mr Putin finds scapegoating easier than change.\" </p> <p><b> Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung </b><br> Editorial, Germany, September 14 </p> <p> \"Nobody would hold it against the Russian president, if, after Beslan, he had reorganised the security services or moved to keep corruption at bay. Both measures are overdue. And no one in the west can honestly say that they know, right now, how he should get out of the abyss in the Caucasus. </p> <p>\"Mr Putin has now affirmed that Chechnya is a sort of breeding ground where nationalist-Islamic terrorism is prospering. But whether that fight has to mean that the central government gets rid of any remaining political rivals - carried out under the lee of a national tragedy ... and sold as a defence against the break-up of the state - is, at the very least, questionable.\"</p>",
  "More atrocities like the Beslan school seizure are \"inevitable\" unless President Vladimir Putin changes his policy towards Chechnya, the European representative of the republic's last freely-elected president, Aslan Maskhadov, warned yesterday. <p>Akhmed Zakayev, who has political asylum in Britain, accused western governments of sharing responsibility for terrorism because of their silence about Russia's human rights violations in Chechnya. </p> <p>\"Your silence has given Putin carte blanche in his attempts to solve the Chechen conflict by force,\" he said. \"Double standards by the west, which does not seem to hesitate to issue condemnations or intervene in other parts of the world suffering similar or less extreme forms of state-sponsored violence, are pushing many peaceful Chechens into carrying out extremist acts.\" </p> <p>The Russian military had killed more than 200,000 people in Chechnya, including 35,000 children, he claimed at a London press conference. </p> <p>Mr Zakayev said international terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism played only a minor role in Chechnya, but the \"Chechen tragedy is being hijacked\" by extremists, partly as a result of the west's reluctance to press for a political solution. </p> <p>He called for international mediation and talks between the Russian government and Mr Maskhadov's representatives. Mr Maskhadov hoped to bring all Chechen political parties to the table, Mr Zakayev said. But he rejected suggestions that the warlord Shamil Basayev, who has claimed responsibility for several terrorist acts, should be included in the talks. </p> <p>Mr Zakayev said his side had condemned the Beslan school seizure from the first moment. In his view the hostage-takers \"were not linked to any political forces in the North Caucasus\", but were probably local radicals motivated by revenge for loved ones who had been killed by Russian troops. </p> <p>He said they might also be Ingush who had lost land or had relatives massacred in 1992, when North Ossetians drove them from their homes in one of the first post-Soviet wars. This would explain why several Ingush were reported among the gunmen. </p> <p>Mr Zakayev ridiculed official Russian claims that Chechens were among the hostage-takers, saying the ones named were people who had been in prison in Russia for years. </p> <p>Boris Berezovsky, an oligarch from the Boris Yeltsin era who is also in exile in Britain, backed the call for talks with Mr Maskhadov. \"The precondition for peace is that Putin declares his readiness to stop the war,\" he said. </p> <p>As deputy secretary of Russia's security council under the then president Yeltsin, Mr Berezovsky helped to bring about the peace talks which ended the first Chechen war in 1997. He acknowledged that Mr Maskhadov no longer had full control over Chechnya's fighters, but said: \"If Putin says he's willing to have talks, Maskhadov will regain it.\" </p> <p>Mr Putin's plan, announced on Monday, to tighten central power in Russia by abolishing elections for regional governors and appointing them instead, was disastrous. \"The complete opposite is needed. He should make Russia a confederation with flexibility and maximum opportunity for autonomy within it,\" he said. </p> <p>The Russian government yesterday announced that it would pour 157bn roubles (\u00a33bn) into the security and law enforcement services next year. \"We need new means for fighting terrorism, including legislative ones,\" the finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, said, according to the Interfax news agency. He also announced that 1.4bn roubles would be spent on improving security on Moscow's metro and other public places next year. </p> <p>The decision came days after Mr Putin criticised the security forces for failing to prevent attacks in the unstable southern regions as well as Moscow. </p> <p>At least 32 militants are believed to have travelled easily through checkpoints set up on the regional borders between the Russian republics of Chechnya, Ingushetia and North Ossetia before the hostage-taking at Beslan, which saw 330 people killed, as well as 31 hostage-takers. </p> <p>The FSB, successor to the KGB, was also embarrassed by its worst-ever losses in the siege - at least 11 members of its elite Vympel and Alpha squads were killed. </p> <p>Russia's prosecutor general, Vladimir Ustinov, yesterday said nine charges including terrorism had been laid against the sole militant held after the siege, a Chechen-born man, Nurpasha Kulayev.</p>",

  "Within hours of the latest suicide bombing in Baghdad yesterday, Faleh Naqib, the Iraqi interior minister, had arrived at the scene dressed in a suit and sunglasses to signal his government's determination to tackle the terrible spiral of violence. <p>At least he was brave enough to venture to the blast site. When the US occupation authorities were running the country before July, none of their officials dared visit the scenes of the countless explosions that have claimed so many innocent lives. </p> <p>Yet yesterday morning, as most Iraqis do most days, the crowd mocked and taunted the minister and his government, incensed at the lawlessness of the new Iraq. </p> <p>It is almost exactly 18 months since America and Britain embarked on the invasion and reshaping of Iraq. By now they had expected marked signs of reconstruction and development and the foundation of a democratic process that would wipe clean decades of dictatorship and hold up a model for the Arab world. And yet the project looks bleaker than ever before. </p> <p>For the second time this year the US military has lost control of several pockets of insurgency across Iraq, including such towns as Falluja and Ramadi, in the Sunni heartland west of Baghdad, and even districts of the capital itself, such as the eastern Shia slums of Sadr City. </p> <p>The kidnapping industry is burgeoning. Since the war hundreds of Iraqis have been taken captive for extortionate ransoms. After separate Sunni and Shia uprisings in April, the kidnappers have set their sights on foreigners: so far at least 26 foreign truck drivers, contractors and journalists have been executed and around another 20 are still being held. Dozens more have eventually been released alive. </p> <p>Attacks on the US-led military coalition have reached a new peak. In April, then the worst month of violence since the war and a time when the US military lost control of some of its most important supply routes, there were an average of 60 attacks a day against the troops. Last month there were 87. </p> <p>Earlier this year US commanders insisted there were at most only 5,000 insurgents in Iraq. Now they publicly admit there may be 12,000. In private they say up to 20,000. </p> <p>The most militant of the groups that make up the \"muqawama,\" or resistance, is al-Tawhid al-Jihad, apparently led by the Jordanian Islamic militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. His group has been blamed for dozens of car bombings and assassinations and has claimed responsibility for kidnappings and executions. </p> <p>Yesterday the group took responsibility for the car bomb that killed 47 people and injured more than 100 others at the police recruiting station in Baghdad. \"With the grace of God, a lion from our martyrdom brigades was successful in striking a centre for apostate police volunteers,\" it said on a militant website. </p> <p>The first elections since the war are due in January and only they, surely, hold the key to tackling the violence. </p> <p>\"We want to rule our country. That is not too much to ask,\" said Wamid Nadmi, a political scientist at Baghdad University and outspoken critic of the occupation. </p> <p>Ayad Allawi, prime minister for less than three months, is desperate to hold the political process on track. His words are laden with confidence and the promise of the tough rule of law. </p> <p>\"What we are after really is implementing the political process, to move towards the elections,\" he said at the weekend. \"We are confident that we will be able to have the elections conducted in January.\" He said he could not see bastions of insurgency such as Falluja still being a problem by then. \"I cannot see this happening,\" he said. </p> <p>But his optimism looks ever more fragile. At the weekend even General Thomas Metz, the second most senior US Army commander in Iraq, admitted it was not now safe enough to hold elections. \"But I do have about four months where I want to get to local control. And then I've got the rest of January to help the Iraqis to put the mechanisms in place,\" he told Associated Press. </p> <p>Mr Allawi has sought to invite back into society those Ba'athists not responsible for committing crimes under the Saddam regime. By doing so he hoped to undermine the insurgency and divide its Islamic components from the secular, military support of ex-Ba'athists. But it has had little success. </p> <p>Now he is trying an alternative route, similar to that used by US troops over the past year. In such towns and districts as Falluja and Sadr City, he has held out the promise of accelerated reconstruction spending in return for peace. It may yet work, although for some Iraqis it is perhaps already too late. </p> <p>He may also be undermined on this front by Washington: so far only $1bn (\u00a3568m) of the $18bn in redevelopment money promised by the US has been spent. Now the US is reportedly planning to redirect $3.4bn earmarked for power, water and other reconstruction projects back into security and improving oil production. </p> <p>The vicious circle of the Iraq project is almost complete: it is too dangerous to spend reconstruction dollars while frustration at the lack of reconstruction fuels the spiral of violence.</p>",

  "Withdrawal of the US-led coalition forces in Iraq would lead to the rapid fragmentation of the country, according to Iraq specialists yesterday. <p>Gareth Stansfield, co-author of Future of Iraq: Democracy, Dictatorship or Division, published this year, said: \"I think the only thing preventing a civil war in Iraq is the coalition forces on the ground. If the US withdraws, the interim government is not in a position to control Iraq.\" </p> <p>Amatzia Baram, professor of Middle East history at the University of Haifa, was even blunter, predicting that the interim Iraqi prime minister, Ayad Allawi, would not be able to hold the towns and cities in the Shia south or Sunni central region of Iraq or even the capital. </p> <p>He recalled that in 1921 a British diplomat had written to London warning that the newly installed king of Iraq would end up as king of only Baghdad if British forces withdrew. Dr Baram said that if the coalition forces pulled out, Mr Allawi \"would not be prime minister of Baghdad but prime minister of the Green Zone [the heavily fortified former palace of Saddam Hussein].\" </p> <p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of the invasion, the debate is shifting to whether it would be better for Iraqis if the coalition forces were to organise a phased withdrawal in the near future. </p> <p>After a series of interviews and polling in Iraq, the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies said \"the single unifying theme espoused by Iraqi politicians will be to invite the US to leave Iraq\" after the election planned for January. </p> <p>Those in favour of withdrawal argue that the coalition forces are the main source of Iraq's problems, encouraging attacks by insurgents inspired by nationalism, religion or revenge. </p> <p>The argument against pulling out was put succinctly yesterday by Ellie Goldsworthy, head of the UK armed forces programme at the Royal United Services Institute in London, who said: \"There is no perfect option available. The least worst option and the only honourable one is to stay put as long as the Iraqi authorities want us there and to keep a low profile as much as we can.\" </p> <p>A former major, she suggested greater involvement of the UN after an election as a way of reducing the US-British presence but predicted that international troops will be on the ground for a long time to come, just as in the Balkans. </p> <p>Mr Stansfield, a fellow of the Middle East programme at the London-based Royal Institute of International Affairs, which put out a report this month warning of the possible fragmentation of Iraq, is extremely pessimistic about Iraq. </p> <p>He said there was an urgent need to re-assess the mission objectives of the British force in southern Iraq which he regarded as being extremely vulnerable. </p> <p>\"I think the British forces are in a very precarious position in terms of manpower on the ground to garrison the south. They are at the mercy of a whole range of political and social factors.\" </p> <p>He said the vulnerability of the British forces would be exposed if there was to be an uprising in Basra comparable to Falluja or Najaf. </p> <p>He was sceptical about the planned January election. \"The idea of democracy in Iraq any time soon is laughable,\" he said, suggesting the likelier outcome was the US and Britain remaining to support an authoritarian regime. </p> <p>He said one plus from the presence of international troops was that they offered a focal point for the insurgents and helped take some of the heat from the interim government. Withdrawal would be seen as a victory by the insurgents and \"that is when it would get nasty\", opening up a struggle for power. </p> <p>Dr Baram agreed: \"In short, I see disaster. It will become like Afghanistan. I do not think withdrawal is a viable option.\" </p> <p>As an alternative to disintegration, he suggested that the coalition forces remain but eventually operate as a mobile force from desert bases, able to drop into a crisis at short notice at the request of an Iraqi government. </p> <p>\"Although it is bloody and tragic for everyone at present, I would say you need about a year or two to bring on an Iraqi security force that can hold its own,\" Dr Baram said. \"Even then, it would need British and US forces for another two or three years.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the lawyer acting for two of the four British citizens and a long-term British resident still remaining in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, I plead with the British government to do something for them in the light of the latest allegations about torture by the US military. I have no doubt that Seymour Hersh is right that Donald Rumsfeld himself is to blame (The buck stops here, G2, September 13) and now we learn that it is not just in Guant\u00e1namo and Abu Ghraib, but also in Mosul (Report, September 14). The five British detainees who returned to Britain in March all made similar grave allegations, and similar allegations have been made by detainees returning to Scandinavian countries and to Russia and by David Hicks, an Australian detainee, to his father when the latter was allowed a visit. The family of one of my clients (Martin Mubanga) has been told that he has made allegations of mistreatment to the Foreign Office, but the FO refuses to say what they are. My other client, Feroz Abbasi, has been in solitary confinement for well over a year. Although Feroz has finally been visited by a US lawyer, she is not allowed by the US authorities to tell his family if he has complaints of mistreatment (a stricture that seems absurd as the US denies there is any). </p> <p>If the British government were not so craven, it could be demanding a proper inquiry. In the light of the British government's failure to do so it is up to all of us to demand action. There is no such thing as an innocent bystander.<br> <strong>Louise Christian</strong> </p> <p>You quote Tony Blair as saying \"I can't apologise for what I think about the world since September 11, or what I have done in the war against this vicious terrorism we face\" (Blair refuses to apologise for Iraq war, September 14).

  "Those who write about les \u00e9v\u00e9nements of 1968 in France are usually favourable to the so-called revolutionaries. So they rarely write about the interior minister Raymond Marcellin, who regarded the students and strikers as enemies of France. He believed that, at best, they were dupes, victims of a plot manufactured in Cuba, and that they had to be repressed. Marcellin has died in Paris at the age of 90. <p>His moment of fame came when President de Gaulle appointed him to the interior ministry on May 31 1968. At this point, the student protesters, who had been joined by some striking workers, appeared to be getting out of hand, and, in his secretive visit to Baden-Baden, De Gaulle seemed to be considering resignation. But he returned, determined to reassert himself and put an end to the crisis. \"It is not a pleasant job,\" De Gaulle was reported to have said. \"But he will do it. He is a man of courage.\"</p> <p>Marcellin's background differed from that of most Gaullists. Indeed, he had never been a member of a Gaullist party. Born in S\u00e9zanne, near Epernay, in the Marne, he trained as a lawyer and taught during the war at the Universit\u00e9-Jeune-France, a Vichy organisation. In 1946, he went to Brittany, where he was elected deputy for the Morbihan department in the first of the fourth republic elections. He was a conservative and an independent, and remained thus.</p> <p>A junior minister in several fourth republic governments, Marcellin welcomed de Gaulle's return to power in 1958. He became a close associate of Georges Pompidou, who took over as prime minister of France in 1962, and was appointed to several ministerial posts, among them public health, industry and planning. He remained a leading member of the non-Gaullist National Centre of independents and peasants.</p> <p>Marcellin replaced Christian Fouchet as interior minister, and when he showed his hostility to various organisations and individuals, De Gaulle remarked that \"now we have the real Fouch\u00e9\" (a reference to the brutal Joseph Fouch\u00e9 of the 1789 revolution). Marcellin increased the police budget and pledged that if it were necessary to have 50,000 policemen to keep order in Paris, then there would be 50,000.</p> <p>A special intelligence unit was created to examine potential revolutionary organisations. The Ligue Communiste was made illegal, and a host of Trotskyist and Maoist groups were broken up, as was the extreme rightwing Ordre Nouveau.</p> <p>The national elections of 1968 were successful for the Gaullists and a tribute to Marcellin, although de Gaulle himself resigned later in the year. Pompidou, the new president, insisted that Marcellin remain in office as the first policeman in France - \"le premier flic de France\".</p> <p>There were many protests against Marcellin's methods, some of them from the police trade union. In 1971, he pushed through an anti-wreckers' bill, which made illegal the mere attendance at a meeting where violence occurred. There were also incidents involving irregular police actions, and, in 1974, it was discovered that a team of police intelligence officers, posing as plumbers, were installing microphones in the offices of the satirical weekly Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9.</p> <p>It was easy to make Marcellin responsible for this action since the aim of the operation was in accordance with ministerial desires to discover the newspaper's source of information about political scandals. So Pompidou moved him to the agriculture ministry, replacing him at the interior ministry with the current president, Jacques Chirac. When Pompidou died suddently in 1974, Marcellin refused to serve under President Val\u00e9ry Giscard D'Estaing, and from then on he was active entirely in Brittany.</p> <p>He remained a deputy until 1997. He was mayor of Vannes from 1965 to 1977, and held other posts on the regional council of Brittany. He always insisted that when the time came to resign, it would be he who would announce the decision. And so it was.</p> <p>He never married.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Raymond Marcellin, politician, born August 19 1914; died September 8 2004</p>",

  "Turkey's two main parties signalled yesterday that the government may drop a proposed law against adultery. <p>Several EU foreign ministers have said that the proposal to punish cheating spouses as part of amendments to the wider penal code might jeopardise Turkey's chances when EU leaders decide in December whether to give it a start date for entry talks. </p> <p>After a last-minute meeting before parliament was due to debate the reforms, officials of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) and main opposition Republican People's party (CHP) said they would present the penal code package as a joint proposal. </p> <p>\"We have an agreement to put forward a law which guarantees rights and freedoms,\" the justice minister, Cemil Cicek, told reporters in a joint announcement with the CHP leader, Deniz Baykal, and foreign minister Abdullah Gul. </p> <p>The three declined to comment directly on the adultery issue. But with the centre-left CHP solidly opposed, it seems the adultery clause will be abandoned. </p> <p>One MP for the CHP said that adultery was not specifically raised at the meeting, but since the AKP accepted the opposition party's suggestion of a joint motion the CHP took this to mean the government was quietly dropping the issue. </p> <p>Turkey's stock market closed up 3% at a record high. </p> <p>The furore over adultery diverted attention from other aspects of the penal code reforms, which are aimed primarily at bringing Turkey's legal framework into line with European norms. </p> <p>\"No one has the right to cast a shadow over the penal code just because of an article which is not even written yet, which does not exist,\" Mr Gul had earlier told AKP MPs in parliament. </p> <p>\"A wrong image is being created.\" </p> <p>The government had argued that outlawing adultery would empower women, protect the family and discourage the illegal but common custom of taking a second wife in a religious marriage. </p> <p>Critics say women in Turkey's conservative heart land would be unlikely to use the law for fear of ostracism or violence, and would have no income if their husbands were jailed. </p> <p>The measure was mooted less than a month before the European commission delivers a report on Turkey's entry bid which will form a basis for the December decision. </p> <p>It would not be the first time the AKP government has backed away from Muslim-inspired reforms that have raised hackles in Turkey's staunchly secularist establishment. </p> <p>Other proposals dropped or shelved include a plan to ease a ban on Muslim-style headscarves in public life and make it easier for pupils from religious schools to go to university. <b>\u00b7</b> Reuters</p>",
  "He could have cranked the volume on his stereo up to 11, conducted a nocturnal screaming match or unleashed a pack of barking dogs. But instead, the Rev Geoff Waggett, the vicar of Ebbw Vale, could face prosecution for the resonant ring of his restored church bell. <p>Grouchy parishioners complained they were being kept awake by the hourly chime from Christ Church in South Wales after the tenor bell sounded its first sonorous note for six years following a painstaking restoration programme.</p> <p>Environmental health officials stepped in and the vicar received an earful from the local council, which has now branded the tolling bell a \"noise nuisance\".</p> <p>\"I resent being treated in the same way as someone playing their hi-fi at 2am,\" said Mr Waggett. \"I think the whole thing is nonsense.\"</p> <p>The vicar believes that a young generation deaf to the charms of the chimes from the church may be responsible for the complaints. \"It seems to be youngsters who have moved into the area in the past few years and are not used to it.

Luis Garcia has been given a free role, lurking behind the lone striker Djibril Cisse who, with his bleached-blond barnet, looks very like a pint of Guinness that's sitting under thre tap settling. </p> <p> <strong>2 mins:</strong> Mohammed Kallon tries to score with a speculative long-distance lob that wafts over the Liverpool cross-bar, causing a few nervous moments for Jerzy Dudek.</p> <p> <strong>4 mins:</strong> Steven Gerrard indicates to the Liverpool bench that he has to come off ... to get a new piece of gaffer-tape to tie up his sock.

He used to be good, y'know. </p> <p> <strong>15 mins:</strong> Monaco launch their first attack of note and string a few passes together around the Liverpool box before Adebayor shoots higher and wider than a Cockney barrow-boy with a crack pipe. </p> <p><strong>17 mins:</strong> Douglas Maicon picks up the ball on the right side of midfield, skips around Harry Kewell and then gives it away.

Great effort from about 35 yards. </p> <p> <strong>19 mins:</strong> Paula Willow writes from New York, as only she can: \"Hi there sailor,\" she begins. \"I'm looking forward to following your exciting commentary this afternoon.

The ball hits the defender's chest and the Kop appeals for a penalty. He was outside the box and it didn't hit his hand - apart from that it was a stonewall spot-kick. </p> <p><strong>28 mins:</strong> Like the American army under orders from George Dubya Bush, Liverpool are attacking in droves. Luis Garcia brings a fine save out of Monaco goalkeeper Flavio Roma with a low left-footed drive from just inside the box.</p> <p> <strong>30 mins:</strong> \"Hi there,\" writes Iqbal Karim from Mombasa, Kenya. \"My name is Iqbal Karim from Mombasa, Kenya.

Djibril Cisse tries to slot a ball across the edge of the Monaco box for Harry Kewell to run on to, but a Monaco defender hacks it clear. The visitors are being completely over-run in midfield. </p> <p> <strong>37 mins:</strong> Not for the first time tonight, Djibril Cisse gets needlessly caught offside.

Are they really playing better?\" asks Mark in Chicago (the windy American city, not the West End musical starring David Hasselhoff of the same name). Yes they are Mark - they've had more shots on goal in this first half alone than they had all last <em>season</em>. </p> <p> <strong>42 mins:</strong> A period of sustained pressure late in the first half from Monaco, but the Liverpool defence stands firm, heading one ball after another clear. </p> <p> <strong>44 mins:</strong> Cisse cuts in from the left wing, plays the ball to Luis Garcia on the edge of the Monaco box, then picks up the one-two. He ruins all his good work by letting the ball Heskey off his shin and into the grateful goalkeeper's path. His poor touch has spoiled a glorious scoring opportunity. </p> <p> <strong>44+1 mins:</strong> Steven Gerrard picks out a Luis Garcia run to the far post with a fantastic long pass from just inside the Monaco half. It lands in the space between goalkeeper and defender, but the young Spaniard can't quite make contact. He applauds his skipper on the quality of the pass anyway. Gerrard, Cisse, Garcia and Alonso have been outstanding in ths first half. Imagine Vernon Kaye in a Doritos advert. Now imagine the exact opposite. <em>That's</em> how good their performances have been and I can think of no higher praise. </p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> </p> <p><strong>A box-office queen writes:</strong> \"Barry, I know how much you hate watching Liverpool, do you want to swap?\" writes Alison Jeeves from the Carling Apollo in Hammersmith. \"You come and talk to PJ Harvey fans, I will come and do your commentary. I won't be much good but I am sure no one will mind. I am quite good at insults if that helps.\"</p> <p>A kind offer Ali, but I'm quite enjoying this match. Also, I wouldn't really know what to say to several thousand PJ Harvey fans. Is she actually playing there tonight, or have they just turned up out of the blue for a Busted gig? Great news from Lyon, by the way - Manchester United are losing 2-0. </p> <p><strong>A lorry-driver from Oregon writes:</strong> \"Oh Barry,\" sighs Paula Willow. \"Honey, I have <em>never</em> been in a truck and the only time I have ever been in Oregon is on a stop-over at Portland Airport. Don't worry baby - I am 100% female. Now, why don't you tell me something about <em>you</em>.\"</p> <p>I'd love to Paula, but I'm gone all shy and giggly. Tee-hee. </p> <p><strong>Douglas Yu writes:</strong> \"If Bush were in charge there would be only seven Liverpool players on the pitch, half of them part-timers with tennis shoes. The Reds would be down by seven, but he'd insist that we were 'turning the corner.' Actually, that last bit reminds me of Houllier.\" </p> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> Monaco get the second half underway. They've made a substitution - the striker Camara is on for ... would you believe I missed it? Thought so. I suspect it may be Douglas Maicon. The sub immediately gets stuck in by hooking a good cross into the far post. Liverpool clear. </p> <p> <strong>47 mins:</strong> My thanks to the 756 pedants who've mailed in to point out that I mistakenly called Djibril Cisse Aliou Cisse earlier in the match. Get over it. Steven Gerrard gets booked for a challenge that was more of an accidental slip than anything malicious. </p> <p> <strong>51 mins:</strong> Well it wasn't Douglas Maicon who went off at half-time, as he's just hurled a long throw into the Liverpool six-yard box. Harry Kewell finally does something useful by heading it clear. </p> <p> <strong>52 mins:</strong> A very sedate start to the second half, but not from Paula Willow. \"Barry! Pull yourself together,\" she demands. \"New York women do not want tittering wimps. We want big hunks of men who take control and order us around. So come on, dude, tell me what's up?\"</p> <p> <strong>54 mins:</strong> Xabi Alonso picks out Luis Garcia on the left wing. His cross into the box is too close to Monaco goalkeeper Roma, who gets to it before Steve Finnan or Djibril Cisse can.</p> <p> <strong>57 mins:</strong> Liverpool win a free-kick just outside the Monaco box. A complex move from the training ground results in John Arne Riise having a pop from about 25 yards. Corner. Nothing comes of it. </p> <p> <strong>58 mins:</strong> Showing some of the sublime skill for which his name used to be a byword, Harry Kewell combines with Xabi Alonso to put Djibril Cisse through one-on-one with the Monaco goalkeeper. Flavio Roma does brilliantly to stay on his feet till the last mili-second, before getting down to block the strikers low effort. Like some hapless gimp tied to a rack in Paula Willow's dominatrix dungeon, he should have been beaten. </p> <p> <strong>62 mins:</strong> For Monaco, Zikos tries a shot from distance which is blocked by Sami Hyypia. </p> <p> <strong>63 mins:</strong> \"Please, someone alert the authorities,\" writes Alison Jeeves.\"The Barry Glendenning that we know and love has been abducted by aliens, or the American Government, and been replaced by some pale imitation. You have never been this nice about the Scousers, ever.\" It's a new regime, Alison. Ding dong the Ged is dead! Metaphorically speaking, I hasten to add. </p> <p> <strong>65 mins:</strong> For anyone who's interested, Real Madrid are being beaten 3-0 by Bayer Leverkusen. Liverpool have taken their foot off the pedal at the moment and are being bossed about by Monaco for the first time in this game. Having said that, the team from the principality aren't looking particularly dangerous in the final third. </p> <p> <strong>68 mins:</strong> Steven Gerrard picks out Harry Kewell at the far post with a fine cross, but his control lets him down under pressure. Liverpool take off Djibril Cisse and replace him with Milan Baros, a young gentleman I will forever be indebted to after his goalscoring exploits at Euro 2004 paid for my summer holidays. </p> <p> <strong>70 mins:</strong> A teasing cross into the Liverpool box. Jerzy Dudek didn't know whether to stick or twist and was eventually rescued by Jamie Carragher, who headed it out for a corner. Nothing comes of it and Liverpool clear. </p> <p> <strong>73 mins:</strong> Milan Baros picks up the ball on the left wing, cuts inside, beats two defenders and shoots low and hard across the face of goal. His effort is blocked. It's all Liverpool at the moment. Luis Garcia goes close after getting away with a rash challenge on the goalkeeper.</p> <p> <strong>77 mins:</strong> Emmanuel Adebayor sneaks in behind Jamie Carragher and almost gets on the end of a back-post cross that Jerzy Dudek should probably have come to claim. Jerzy's looked less than solid under the high ball tonight. </p> <p> <strong>79 mins:</strong> Liverpool substitution: Harry Kewell off, Stephen Warnock on. </p> <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> Luis Garcia misses an absolute sitter. On the edge of the six-yard box with loads of time on the ball and a vast expanse of empty goal to aim at, he lashed at it and sent the ball fizzing wide of Flavio Roma's left upright. An astonishing miss. </p> <p> <strong>83 mins: Liverpool 2 - 0 Monaco</strong> A contender for goal of the season from Milan Baros, who wasn't good enough to get into Ged Houllier's Liverpool team. He picked up a long ball on the right wing, cut inside and found himself on the byline, a couple of yards from the Monaco post and goalkeeper. As his team-mates screamed for a cross at the far post, he waited and waited and waited before shimming his hips like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, dragging the ball inside and slotting it past Flavio Roma with his left foot into the bottom left-hand corner from the tightest of angles. </p> <p> <strong>87 mins:</strong> Liverpool substitution: Biscan on, Luis Garcia off. Milan Baros finds himself through one-on-one with the Monaco goalkeeper, but is foiled this time, much to the displeasure of Steven Gerrard, who was screaming for a pass so he could slot the ball into an empty goal. </p> <p> <strong>89 mins:</strong> \"Can you send me Paula Willow's e-mail address, please?\" pants a clearly needy David Baines. I would David, but I don't think a man who tries to pull chicks on Internet football commentaries is the kind of chap I want Paula to be consorting with. She'd make mince-meat of you in the cab of her 18-wheeler.</p> <p> <strong>90+2 mins:</strong> Peep! Peep! Peep! Liverpool get their first three points of this Champions League campaign on the board. They'll face better sides than this Monaco team, but you can only beat what's put in front of you. I was very pleasantly surprised with their performance tonight. Anyway, that's all from me. I'm off to dust off my leather jacket, Brylcreem back my hair and start perfecting my bad-boy act in a feeble attempt to impress Paula Willow and sweep her off her feet. Thanks for your time and your emails. I hope you enjoyed a great game as much as I did.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Team news:</strong> Manchester United have about as much clout in a knockout round as Joe Palooka, but after a half-hour hairdryer treatment from Fergie this afternoon, they should be fairly fired up. John O'Shea's back in the line up (not that I'm in any remote way suggesting the two might be linked), and even after his weekend shenanigans, Tim Howard's also strolled into the starting XI.</p> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> I don't fancy calling this one, if it's all the same to you. I've got a feeling Ferguson's already got his smug \"I told you we weren't finished\" look prepared, so it's probably best not to talk about Lyon's fine form and United's ropey start with too much confidence.</p> <p><strong>More preamble:</strong> \"By my watch five minutes have gone and you haven't uttered a word,\" says an anonymous reader. \"It can't be that boring yet.\" As fascinating as I find the players kicking their heels in the tunnel, I thought it best to leave it to your imagination. Hope you kept your receipt for that Rolex.</p> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Manchester United are in their usual red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Lyon are in a sort of car-interior-grey shirt, red shorts and red socks. United kick-off, and already Pete in Vancouver has decided to desert me in favour of watching the replay tonight. Van Nistelrooy, meanwhile, has just put his studs through the thigh of one Lyon player or another.</p> <p><strong>4 mins:</strong> Lyon are in control in these early moments, United looking slightly ragged in their pursuit of the ball already. Ronaldo-on-his-rear-end count: 1.</p> <p><strong>8 mins:</strong> \"My watch was free - I found it in 1973, and I don't have the receipt from the police station,\" says that anonymous reader, foolishly presuming I care. \"Since we are dependent on you for information it's not a bad idea to give it. If there's a delay in kicking off it would do no harm to let us know.\" I assure you, if kick-off had been delayed I would have let you know. As it is, you just jumped onto your high horse a moment too soon.</p> <p>There has been a delay, however, after Manchester United studs again found Lyon flesh [detail absent thanks to pestering from imbeciles].</p> <p><strong>11 mins:</strong> Lyon are looking very comfortable on the ball, which has barely seen their half, let alone their goal. Final ball is sadly lacking so far though, and a sort of ping-pong melee ensues.</p> <p><strong>12 mins:</strong> Oof! United nick possession and Ronaldo gets a great ball across - only for Scholes to miskick and Giggs, teeing up the rebound on the edge of the area, hits it high and wide. Better, though.</p> <p><strong>15 mins:</strong> That's what I love about French crowds: they make a constant noise. A sort of low, generator hum when the opposition have the ball, and an Olympic-grade cheer/clap ensemble when they regain possession. It's fluctuating like Oprah's waistline at the moment, though United are starting to look a bit more comfortable.</p> <p><strong>18 mins:</strong> Heinze let's a Lyon attack into the area, but the last ball from Wiltord is overhit and Howard takes without throwing it backwards between his legs. At the other end Giggs latches on to a ball in the six yard box but flashes it hard and wide, much to the annoyance of Paul Scholes, who was waiting unmarked a few feet away. Even with that face, he can manage a scowl.</p> <p><strong>20 mins:</strong> A Lyon corner finds Cacapa in acres of space, the free header goes a matter of inches wide. Even worse, a complete balls-up by someone in the United defence [now confirmed as Silvestre] lets Malouda in one-on-one with Howard, whose barely breathing after the last one, but he gets his body in the way. So that's what squeaky bum time means...</p> <p><strong>25 mins:</strong> If I get one more email from you anon, I'll have to get the police involved, and don't think I won't. Go back to your chums in pedants' corner and let me get on with my job. On the pitch, there's nothing really doing apart from the exchange of possession punctuated by fouls and throw-ins.</p> <p><strong>28 mins:</strong> \"Can I again have a shout out in the fourteenth minute - it's my goal for the day,\" says Martin Heward-Mills, whose watch is clearly also defective. Or have I stepped into a parallel universe? Ah no, the reassuring sight of van Nistelrooy battling his way into the penalty area and promptly falling over. Free-kick goes the other way though, and Juninho flashes a shot over the bar.</p> <p><strong>30 mins:</strong> Of all the insults in the world, I've just been accused of being an Arsenal fan. Not insulting in itself, but when a slight change in your genetics would have seen you named after Glenn Hoddle, it's crushing. Lyon, meanwhile, aren't exactly crushing United, but if anyone's going to make this tie interesting, they're looking likely at the moment.</p> <p><strong>33 mins:</strong> A ball going nowhere but out is swept up and over by O'Shea for a corner, and a brilliant header from Frau is kept out by Scholes on the near post. Superb defending from the Ginger One.</p> <p>And before anyone else clicks \"send\", the commentary was what was supposed to start at 7.30pm, not the game. Sweet Lord.</p> <p><strong>GOAL!! Lyon 1-0 Manchester United</strong> A free-kick from over 30 yards out from Juninho somehow finds its way through to Howard, who can't hold, and Cris prods it home. Maybe keeping faith in old Tim wasn't such a good idea after all.</p> <p><strong>38 mins:</strong> Lyon have sparked now and as soon as they get the ball it's the goalline they're heading for. United are trying to calm things down but they're losing the ball far too easily.</p> <p> <strong>41 mins:</strong> Another free kick from the same area, but a few yards closer in, that started the goal, after Djemba-Djemba felled Malouda with about as much grace as Dawn French in a tutu. It goes for a corner though, and United clear their lines.</p> <p><strong>43 mins:</strong> There's something uncomfortable about using the word rampant, but when Lyon have the ball, i.e. most of the time, they look so. Malouda and Wiltord are really showing the back four up...</p> <p> <strong>GOAL!! Lyon 2-0 Manchester United</strong> It was on the cards: Wiltord steaming at the Wes Brown Comedy Experience and slipping a ball through to Frau who finds the top left hand corner with the outside of his boot.</p> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> By the look on Fergie's face, I'd say the foundations at that stadium are going to take a hell of a battering in the next 15 minutes. I can't see them finding a way to stop Wiltord and co., let alone finding van Nistelrooy and ball in the area at the same time. They'll probably win 3-2 now...</p> <p>Bobby Otter, meanwhile, has a gmail invite for me. Anyone know what the sweet bejesus that is? I don't follow all this technomalogical marlaky.</p> <p><strong>Interval whinging and moaning:</strong> \"What is your problem with Man Utd?\" asks Richard Bartley, as if anyone could possibly have watched that first half and come out with something truly positive about United's performance, problem or no problem.</p> <p>If any United fans were just thinking they had it bad, I've got an inbox full of Arsenal fans singing about Sylvain Wiltord - if anyone from bigdough is reading, you've got a North American Buy-side Research Analyst name of Brandon Russell doing nowt.</p> <p><strong>Other scores:</strong> Liverpool 1-0 Monaco, Fenerbache 1-0 Sparta Prague, Bayer Leverkusen 1-0 Real Madrid.</p> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> Fergie seemed distinctly hoarse talking to Sky Sports just now, so let's hope United come out and play like they should be able to [insert your own for all that money gubbins]. </p> <p><strong>50 mins:</strong> Djemba-Djemba's just given away a freekick in the exact same position Lyon scored from, but fortunately, or unfortunately for Scholes, Juninho lamps it straight into him. </p> <p>Fear not, the gmail mystery has been solved. I don't know how I didn't hear about it, with all the hours I spend listening to the wireless.</p> <p> <strong>53 mins:</strong> Maybe it's just me, but is Heinze supposed to be any good? Because if he is, well, he's not, frankly. I've seen a better first touch from the South London Blind XI.</p> <p><strong>55 mins:</strong> Ronaldo uses his stepovers to good effect to earn a corner, which he duly takes, and duly fails to beat the first man. Second go comes to noth - oh, you can guess.</p> <p><strong>GOAL!! Lyon 2-1 Manchester United:</strong> Ronaldo chases hard after a loose ball and chips it back into the danger area, where equine wonder Ruud van Nistelrooy pounces to head home for United. Game well and truly on, just 55 minutes after schedule.</p> <p> <strong>60 mins:</strong> Heinze puts that first touch to use by robbing some Lyon player or other of his ability to have children, but otherwise United look a much better prospect for the remaining half hour. </p> <p><strong>GOAL!! Lyon 2-2 Manchester United:</strong> van Nistelrooy again, hooking onto a Ronaldo dink and lifting it over the oncoming keeper. You remember that game at White Hart Lane a couple of seasons ago...</p> <p><strong>65 mins:</strong> Lyon look like they're struggling with the psychology at work here now, and have resorted to trying to hurt Ruud van Nistelrooy, mostly via Cris's studs. And the shouting and arm flinging has started too. Oh dear.</p> <p><strong>69 mins:</strong> Govou latches onto a loose ball on the edge of the area, but Brown does enough to send it for a corner. Wiltord finds it and lines it up nicely, but Scholes once again saves the day with a block by the line. </p> <p><strong>73 mins:</strong> The loss of possession that would have Alan Hansen shaking his head and muttering \"sloppy\" is creeping back into United's game, but Lyon are putting any balls that might have been dangerous far too close to the keeper, even if it is Tim Howard.</p> <p>Oh Frau went off for Nilmar, by the way, but I don't suppose you're really too bothered.</p> <p><strong>77 mins:</strong> Govou off, Ben Arfa on, and Lyon will go another down before nicking two in the dying moments, according to a Iain Chambers. Entertaining stuff it would be too, but Ronaldo, free on the edge of the area, makes the wrong decision and Lyon break - only for Nilmar to miss from about half a yard out.</p> <p><strong>81 mins:</strong> You're all emailing about Wiltord's 90th minute winner being on the way, but if it's going to happen, he'll have to do better than that - swinging at a ball on the right hand corner of the six yard box and planting it alongside Beckham's penalty somewhere in the stratosphere.</p> <p><strong>84 mins:</strong> I've been reliably informed by Brandon Russell that Ben Arfa is seen as the new Zidane. A scorching free-kick and penalty in the 89th and 90th minute it is, then.</p> <p>Smith on for van Nistelrooy, Phil Neville on for O'Shea, match slowly becoming less and less interesting.</p> <p><strong>87 mins:</strong> Ronaldo, flitting down the left and beguiling all in his path with his rapid shimmying, seems to be one of the few people in a red shirt still really really trying.</p> <p><strong>89 mins:</strong> That 90th minute winner is off, Wiltord's come off for Clement. Lyon are putting together some decent possession though... have they got long enough?</p> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> Two minutes added, so United have got plenty of time to pull their trusty last minute hat out of the bag. Lyon don't care one hoot though, and push forward to make a half-decent penalty claim against Phil Neville, but closer inspection reveals the ref was right not to give it.</p> <p><strong>92 mins:</strong> Juninho has a go from 25 yards and finds the post. Agonising for the French, but the whistle is blown and a draw it is. Thanks for your time, emails, and almost constant abuse. It wouldn't be the same without you.</p> <p><strong>Lyon:</strong> Coupet, Abidal, Reveillere, Essien, Ca\u00e7apa, Cris, Pernambucano, Malouda, Wiltord, Frau, Govou.<br> <strong>Subs:</strong> Puydebois, Diatta, Berthod, Clement, Ben Arfa, Nilmar, Bergougnoux. </p> <p><strong>Manchester United:</strong> Howard, Heinze, Brown, Silvestre, O'Shea, Giggs, Keane, Scholes, Djemba-Djemba, Ronaldo, van Nistelrooy.<br> <strong>Subs:</strong> Carroll, Neville (P), Richardson, Kleberson, Fletcher, Bellion, Smith.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Wolfgang Stark (Germany)</p>",
  "<p><strong>\"Will Wayne Rooney be the first Scouser to play for Manchester United?\"</strong> asks Alex Freudmann.</p> <p>The answer quite simply, Alex, is no. But here's Richard Bryce to provide a little background information. \"Young Wayne will be the eighth Scouser to pull on the red shirt of Manchester United,\" he begins. \"The most illustrious predecessor was Croxteth-born Steve Coppell who played almost 400 games for United between 1975 and 1983, and 42 for England.</p> <p>\"Before him, Liverpudlians Willie Anderson and Albert Kinsey played ten times and once respectively in the sixties and Ted Connor played 15 matches between 1909 and 1911 with Arthur Marshall notching up six in 1902-03.\"</p> <p>There's more. \"Neither is Rooney the first Scouser to sign from Everton. Alf Schofield joined Newton Heath (as United were then called) from Everton in 1900 and played 179 games until retiring in 1907. More recently John Gidman racked up 115 games in United red after signing from the Toffees in 1981.\"</p> <p>As several of you point out, Peter Davenport, who scored 26 goals for United between 1986 and 1988, may also be added to the list, though it depends whether you consider his birthplace Birkenhead to be a Scouse area.</p> <p><strong>ENGLAND WITHOUT A MAN UNITED PLAYER</strong></p> <p><strong>\"After Gary Neville was substituted against Poland, the England team contained no players from Manchester United,\" chuckles Martin Kinrade. \"When was the last time this happened?\"</strong></p> <p><strong>It seemed like a really good question - but the answer is actually last month, against Ukraine, when Gary Neville and Alan Smith both came off at half-time. In fact, you don't even have to go back too far to find when an England team last <em>started</em> without a Manchester United player: October 10, 1999, in a 2-1 win over Belgium at Sunderland's Stadium Of Light. For the record, the starting line-up that day was: Seaman; Keown, Adams, Southgate; Dyer, Ince, Redknapp, Lampard, Guppy; Shearer, Phillips.</strong></p> <p><strong>More significant, perhaps, is the last time England began a <em>competitive</em> match without a United player. The answer? That fateful night of June 26, 1996, when they lost to Germany in the Euro '96 semi-final. Gary Neville was suspended - he would have played - David Beckham was six weeks away from changing his life from the halfway line at Selhurst Park, Paul Scholes was a supersub, Teddy Sheringham was a Spurs player, and Phil Neville was sat with his brother on the England bench. The starting XI that night - as you all should know, of course - was: Seaman; Adams, Southgate, Pearce; McManaman, Platt, Ince, Gascoigne, Anderton; Sheringham, Shearer.</strong></p> <p><strong>ENGLAND WITH THREE SPURS PLAYERS</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Before last week, when did Spurs last have three players in an England starting line-up?\"</strong> asks Rob Crowley. <strong>\"Was it really in the 1970s?\"</strong></p> <p>Not quite - in fact it was May 1987, when Glenn Hoddle (about to leave for Monaco and Arsene Wenger), Chris Waddle and Steve Hodge lined up in a 0-0 draw away to Scotland.</p> <p>A month earlier, however, England had <em>five</em> Tottenham players in the starting line-up away to Turkey: Hoddle, Waddle, Hodge, Clive Allen and Gary Mabbutt. It didn't stop them drawing 0-0, mind.</p> <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</strong> <strong>\"I remember reading that when the Premiership began, there were only nine foreigners (not counting Irish, Welsh or Scottish) attached to Premiership clubs. Is this true? And if so, who were they?\"</strong> asked Dara Dowd, back in February 2002. You're so close Dara. The actual number of foreign (not UK and Ireland) players in their team's starting line-ups when the Premier League began in 1992-93 was ten - with two more coming on as substitutes. As Simon Gleave points out, \"The ten starters were John Jensen (Arsenal), Anders Limpar (Arsenal), Eric Cantona (Leeds United), Michel Vonk (Manchester City), Peter Schmeichel (Manchester United), Andrei Kanchelskis (Manchester United), Gunnar Halle (Oldham Athletic), Jan Stejskal (QPR), Roland Nilsson (Sheffield Wednesday) and Hans Segers (Wimbledon). \"Robert Warzycha (Everton) came on as a substitute that weekend, as did Ronnie Rosenthal (Liverpool),\" he adds. \"So, the foreign legion on the opening weekend of the Premiership comprised of two Danes, two Dutchmen, two Swedes, a Pole, a Frenchman, a Ukrainian (who played internationally for Russia), a Norwegian, an Israeli and a Czech.\" Incidentally, Simon has compiled a complete list of all foreigners that have played in the Premiership (up to the end of the 1999-2000) season.

  "MPs tonight voted again to ban foxhunting, after a debate interrupted by pro-hunting demonstrators storming into the Commons chamber. <p>The Commons was suspended for nearly half an hour after the security breach, when five men were dragged out by officials.</p> <p>The hunting bill, which also bans hare coursing, was given a second reading by 356 votes to 166 majority 190, to cheers in the crowded chamber. </p> <p>At 9.15pm, at the end of a day of high drama, MPs voted to implement the ban from July 2006 - giving hunters one more season. </p> <p>Ministers had originally planned a two-year delay in implementing the legislation to allow time for hunts to prepare for the ban and avoid any clash with the looming general election. However, the government backed an amendment by leading anti-hunt backbencher Tony Banks reducing the phase-out time. That move was backed by 342 votes to 15, a majority of 327, indicating that by this point pro-hunting MPs had realised the case was lost.</p> <p>The bill now goes to the Lords tomorrow, and if peers block it the Parliament Act will be used to force the measure on to the statute book.</p> <p>However, one potential pitfall for Tony Blair may still lie ahead - if peers do decide to reject the bill and it is introduced via the Parliament Act, the ban is likely to be immediate, rather than postponed.</p> <p>Analysis of the division list shows that Mr Blair did not vote in the second reading of the bill, but the Tory leader, Michael Howard, opposed a ban. Downing Street said the prime minister had \"other engagements.\"</p> <p>Although it was a free vote, several MPs voted against their \"party line\". Labour MPs Kate Hoey, Mark Fisher and Barry Sheerman voted to keep hunting, while Ann Widdecombe and five other Tories voted for a ban. Sixteen Liberal Democrat MPs voted against outlawing the pursuit. Thirty-three Lib Dem MPs, including their leader, Charles Kennedy, voted for a ban.</p> <p>In Parliament Square thousands of hunt supporters, who had demonstrated noisily all day, greeted tonight's vote with anger and disappointment. Earlier, demonstrators battled with a line of police officers, with several protesters bloodied by police batons.</p> <p><b>Security breach</b><br></p> <p>In the most dramatic moment of the day-long debate - which essentially saw backbench MPs on both sides of the debate rehash the arguments over hunting - five men in white T-shirts rushed to the dispatch box pursued by door staff in tailcoats, who tackled one of the protesters to the ground. One of the men jabbed his finger and shouted at the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael. </p> <p>A Commons source said up to 10 protesters had burst into a corridor behind the Speaker's chair, where four of the men entered, but security staff were able to apprehend most of them. One of the intruders was believed to be the son of rock star Bryan Ferry.</p> <p>The deputy speaker, Sylvia Heal, lifted the suspension 25 minutes after the men were ejected but the break-in will reopen questions on Commons security just months after a fathers' rights campaigner threw purple powder at the prime minister. </p> <p>The Countryside Alliance later confirmed that some of those who stormed the Commons were from the organisation. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the organisation said: \"We understand that some of those who went into the chamber were members, but they were acting as individuals.\"</p> <p>The vote is still scheduled for 8pm tonight, meaning the debate lost close to half an hour to the activists. Labour's huge majority in the Commons will almost certainly ensure that MPs vote for a ban tonight. The bill will then got to the Lords tomorrow, who - although a date for a vote has yet to be set - will be equally certain to vote against a ban. </p> <p><b>Violent protests</b><br></p> <p>Outside the Commons, police clashed with angry crowds of pro-hunt demonstrators in Parliament Square. </p> <p>The cause of the violence was not immediately clear. It seemed that some of the crowd had pushed against the police line, and the police responded by using their batons to keep them back, as officers in riot gear ran to shore up the lines. Several minor injuries were reported by the ambulance service. </p> <p>\"Tony Blair's a wanker,\" the crowd chanted as members of the Countryside Alliance stumbled away from the police line, soaking up the blood with tissues and handkerchiefs. </p> <p>Scotland Yard estimated that around 10,000 people had gathered for a demonstration against the bill. Scuffles broke out on the south-west corner of Parliament Square at 3.30pm as protesters set off fireworks and lobbed plastic bottles and placards at lines of uniformed police officers, knocking their hats off their heads. </p> <p>The organiser of the demonstration pleaded for calm, saying: \"You are doing our cause harm. We have no problem with the police.\" But his pleas went unheard beneath the loud whistles and cheers of the crowd. </p> <p>By 4pm, the police had expanded their lines and handed out riot gear to the 100 officers on the scene. Scotland Yard described the incident as a \"minor scuffle\". </p> <p><b>Arrests</b><br></p> <p>Police said seven people had been arrested and were being held in a south London police station. </p> <p>Three were arrested for breach of the peace, one for disorderly behaviour, and a fifth for affray and assault on a police officer. </p> <p>A sixth person was arrested for using threatening words and behaviour and another for affray. </p> <p>All the alleged offences related to events outside parliament. </p> <p>Scotland Yard said 17 people were understood to have been injured - 16 members of the public and one police officer, who received head injuries.</p> <p>Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, said he believed the police had behaved with remarkable restraint. </p> <p>\"These appalling scenes show that the Countryside Alliance have no respect for the police, no respect for law and order and no respect for parliamentary democracy. </p> <p>\"The Countryside Alliance has been winding up their supporters all day with platform references, even while the rioting was going on, to war on the government and the chanting of death threats to Tony Blair.\"</p>",
  "In a bid to get in touch with \"real people\", the Conservative party today unveiled its new logo; a muscular forearm, sleeves rolled back, holding aloft the party's traditional flaming torch in red, white and blue. <p>The party's chairman, Liam Fox, said it represented the Tories' no-nonsense approach to government and pride in being British, rather than an attempt to win back former supporters who have transferred their allegiance to the UK Independence party. </p> <p>He added that the voters who had seen the logo at the party's focus groups described it as \"stylish and modern\". </p> <p>The new look will get its first outing at the party conference next month, where Michael Howard will for the first time make two keynote speeches and unveil a raft of new policies. </p> <p>By tradition, the Conservative leader's closing speech has been the high point of past conferences. This time, Mr Howard will speak on Tuesday on the \"direction\" the party is going, and on Thursday to give an end of conference \"rallying call\".</p> <p>At the Tories' new headquarters in Victoria, Dr Fox said he wanted the gathering to discuss issues of real concern to voters rather than pander to the \"Westminster village\". </p> <p>The debates would focus on themed topics - such as \"the right to choose\" highlighting policies in education and health, and \"freedom from fear\" dealing with law and order - rather than the briefs of individual Whitehall departments.</p> <p>Dr Fox said the party had decided to change the way it structured debate because \"that's politics in the Westminster village. It's not how real people see the real world around them\". </p> <p> And he added that the party's frontbench would be searching out for \"real people\" to address the conference, some of whom may not be \"naturally sympathetic to our views\", in the coming weeks.</p>",

  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to Westminster <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; FROM BRIGHTON</b></p> <p>The Backbencher asked the Guardian's chief reporter Kevin Maguire for his reflections on this week's TUC conference.</p> <p>\"Tony Blair came to the TUC this week, spoke through gritted teeth and left as fast as Kelly Holmes. He obviously didn't want to be here: the prime minister never enjoys his trips to the seaside to meet the brothers and sisters, but with an election about eight months off he knew he had to come. He gave what Geffrey Goodman, a veteran industrial commentator, described as the most pro-union speech since Harold Wilson in the mid-1960s, but it was heard in almost total silence, didn't go down well, and afterwards trade union leaders would wink and laugh as they gave quotes to newspaper reporters saying what a good speech it had been. Although they said it, they certainly didn't believe it, and their views in private were very different. </p> <p>\"However, in some ways Mr Blair has called the union leaders' bluff. They put great store in the so-called Warwick accord, a 56-point agreement reached between the party leadership and union leaders in July at Labour's national policy forum. A few of the proposals in it are just waffley generalities, such as a commitment to improve a level playing field in competitiveness abroad. Others are more specific, such as giving workers more paid time off. For instance, there's a law which says you are entitled to four weeks paid leave a year. Bank holidays are currently counted within that four weeks, but if Labour wins another term, they will be excluded. Now the unions, though they haven't got what they wanted, have been told to enthuse their people and get them out and campaigning for a Labour government at the next election. The message was rammed home by a succession of cabinet ministers who made the trek to the seaside: there was Clarke, Milburn, McCartney, Armstrong, Benn - you name them, they came here.</p> <p>\"If they listened loud enough, they could hear rows over civil service job cuts, pensions, manufacturing, and employment rights. Most of them, it must be said, seemed to enjoy the dinner that was put on for them by the TUC rather than the actual conversation. Off they trotted and the union boys and girls, although they are supposed to behave, don't seem like they are going to do it. If Mr Blair thinks he has called their bluff, which to an extent he has, I think they are prepared to see how far they can push him.</p> <p>\"Here, as the TUC winds up, Seb Coe is preparing to speak - as a former Olympic gold medallist he can extol the virtues and values and jobs that the Olympics would bring to London in 2012. No doubt he'll run round those arguments. But you can hear in the background the sound of hammering and drilling, and that's because Brighton is going to be transformed into Tony Town. The week after next, the Labour party conference will be here in the same hall. Unfortunately for Mr Blair, the same union leaders will be here too and they are now drafting their emergency motions which have to be put in to the Labour party by 5pm on Friday - and they're going to be making a lot more demands on public services, manufacturing, employment and pensions.</p> <p>\"There is a bridge linking two hotels which is being constructed now which looks like turning into Tony's Bridge of Sighs rather than a Bridge over Troubled Water.\"</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; HOLD IT!</b></p> <p>The government may not be able to prevent pro-hunt protesters breaking into the Commons chamber during today's hunting bill, but the Backbencher was intrigued to discover how closely the actions of MPs are controlled in the debate. Closer inspection of the bill's specifics reveals the injunction that \"no dilatory motion may be made except by a minister of the Crown\". A free vote it may be, but Tony's leaving nothing to chance ...</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; WHIPPED INTO A FRENZY</b></p> <p>Excellent news from Tom Watson: Britain's first blogging MP is to continue posting on <a href=\"http://tom-watson.co.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">his website </a> despite his appointment to the government whip's office. His first revelation is, however, a bit of a disappointment, containing nothing sordid or shocking from the infamous black book, the whip's bible of MPs' indiscretions. Instead he's made some more mundane discoveries - the difference between a new clause, a clause stand parts and an amendment, for instance; and why debates on committees are taken in no particular order relating to the sequence of clauses in a bill. Thank goodness the government spent so much time modernising parliament.</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>Readers were asked just how much time Norman Fowler spent with his family after coining that famous phrase in January 1990. \"Nothing like long enough\" may be true, Phil Back, but it is not the answer the Backbencher was seeking. The correct answer, as Patrick Mahon points out, was somewhere around 2 years and 4 months (Jan 1990-May 1992). However, Patrick also points out that Norman spent a good portion of that time writing an \"indescribably boring\" memoir of his time in office, so perhaps his family was not, in fact, the number one priority.</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS WEEK'S COMPETITON</b></p> <p>Is the Backbencher alone in being a little weary of voting on foxhunting? If another ruddy-faced, wax-jacketed yokel blows a horn in her ear while she's trying to slip into St Stephens she may have to resort to a merciful killing herself.

Its conference guide lists Damian Green and John Bercow as keynote speakers at its Bournemouth get-together. Unfortunately, the pair resigned from the frontbench last week.</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; SCOOPS AND OOPS</b></p> <p>It's been a good few days for ITV news. The tabloid bulletin got the scoop of the week when it persuaded Lord Bragg to spill the beans on Tony Blair's resignation plans - losing him his invite to Cherie Blair's next birthday party in the process. But the channel's coverage of Tony's TUC speech proved less adept. A mid-oratory cut to an unimpressed delegate revealed not a disillusioned Labour voter but Yunus \"Bully-boy\" Baksh, the Socialist Workers party's permanent candidate for the leadership of Unison, and a man about as likely to cheer the PM as Gordon Brown.</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; LIGHT WORK</b></p> <p>It is a relief to the Backbencher that at last someone is trying to cut back on \"fat government\" That man is Tory health spokesman, Andrew Lansley, who has taken to <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/cm040901/text/40901w52.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">quizzing ministers about the cost of the Department of Health's lightbulbs</a>.

  "<p>This year's London film festival will for the first time feature a documentary gala screening, in recognition of the recent revival of factual film-making, typified by movies such as Fahrenheit 9/11 and Super Size Me. </p> <p>The festival, which will feature almost 300 feature length and short films over 16 days from October 20 to November 4, is also set to expand its influence into the London boroughs and across the country with an extension of its touring programme.</p> <p>Fahrenheit 9/11 has become the highest-grossing documentary of all time, and Amanda Neill, director of the British film institute (BFI), said the decision to stage a documentary gala screening had been directly influenced by the genre's recent successes. Galas are prestigious screenings of films which festival organisers wish to highlight.</p> <p>\"Documentary and fact-making films have this year brought audiences into contact with a number of fascinating new areas of interest,\" said Neill. \"This rise of the issue-based film has caused us to look at our own festival programme to ensure we fully represent this area of film-making.\"</p> <p>The 2004 documentary gala will be Mondovino, from the director of Sunday, Jonathan Nossiter. It looks at the growing impact of globalisation on the wine industry in countries as diverse as Brazil, France, the US, Italy and Argentina. The movie has been such a labour of love for the film-maker that he reportedly intends to release a 10-hour version on DVD.</p> <p>As previously announced, the festival will open with the UK premiere of Mike Leigh's Vera Drake. This film's standing has been boosted since its selection; it took the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival last week, with Imelda Staunton picking up the best actress award. Staunton plays a 1950s housewife whose respectable working-class family are unaware she has been helping young women to have backstreet abortions. </p> <p>Mike Leigh, speaking in London at the press launch for the festival, told of his delight at headlining an event which he said had played a major part in gaining recognition and acceptance for his own particular film-making style, sometimes dismissed as \"kitchen sink\".</p> <p>He said: \"My own film Grown Ups, made originally for the BBC, was shown here in 1980. It was the first film of this kind to be shown as a proper movie and that started the whole tradition of this type of film being taken seriously and respected.\"</p> <p>Leigh paid tribute to the festival's artistic director, Sandra Hebron, for her innovative approach to curating. \"They don't open the London film festival with films like Vera Drake,\" he said, before adding, \"... they do now\".</p> <p>Closing the festival is the world premiere of David O'Russell's existential comedy I Heart Huckabees, starring Jason Schwartzmann, Mark Wahlberg, Naomi Watts, Lily Tomlin, Dustin Hoffman and Jude Law. It features husband and wife team Hoffman and Tomlin as \"existential detectives\" helping the likes of Brad (Law) and Albert (Schwartzmann) deal with their epistemological issues.</p> <p>Hebron said the opening and closing films had been chosen for their ability to generate debate among critics and audiences alike, and for their sheer diversity and excellence. \"We feel very strongly the festival should be about discussion,\" she said. </p> <p>The festival's guiding principle, she added, had been to find \"the most original, inventive and experimental films being made.\" As part of this ethos there would be an 'experimenta' section, whose films will form part of the festival's touring programme, which travels round the country from January next year. \"These are films which would otherwise not be seen in other parts of the UK,\" said Hebron. </p> <p>Six new cinemas in outer London areas have been engaged for festival screenings, broadening the event's reach within the capital. The six local London cinemas are the Watermans in Brentford, the Phoenix in East Finchley, the Genesis in Mile End, Dalston's Rio Cinema, the David Lean cinema at Croydon's Clocktower arts centre and filmworks in Greenwich.</p> <p>The London film festival runs from October 20 - November 4 2004.</p> <p><strong>Gala screenings</strong></p> <p>House of Flying Daggers (dir.

  "The rural affairs minister today challenged the pro-hunting campaign to take its revenge on the government at the ballot box - rather than through a campaign of civil disobedience and trespass once today's bill banning foxhunting is passed. <p>With a vote for a complete ban on hunting with dogs by July 2006 now looking inevitable tonight, Alun Michael warned the Countryside Alliance and its allies to steer clear of \"violent protest\" and instead campaign to reinstate hunting at the next general election.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of today's Commons debate, Mr Michael said: \"The place for anybody who disagrees with the ban on hunting, the place to make their point is not on the streets but through the ballot box.\"</p> <p>Mr Michael's words appeared to go unheeded by the thousands of pro-hunting protesters who filled Parliament Square today, chanting slogans and clashing with police in full riot gear. </p> <p>Commons proceedings were also suspended briefly this afternoon after five protesters broke into the debating chamber. An investigation is currently under way into how they managed to get past security.</p> <p>Mr Michael, who is piloting the bill for the government, said hunt supporters had no right to indulge in civil disobedience, nor, for example, to deny the Ministry of Defence access to land for training purposes as a form of protest at the hunting bill. </p> <p>He said: \"Those who suggest that they should frustrate the work of the armed forces, or indulge in protests of a disruptive sort, should recognise that there is one place to make changes of this sort, and that is the ballot box. </p> <p>\"The point we are making is that there is no excuse for violent protest ... or standing in the way of the armed forces and their training. </p> <p>\"We are being a reasonable, moderate government, saying this issue has to be resolved, we promised to resolve it, and if we can only resolve it by the use of the Parliament Act, then that will be done.\" </p> <p>MPs will vote to give the bill a second reading at around 5.45pm, but the more controversial vote on the amendment to ban foxhunting with hounds by July 2006 at around 8.45pm.</p> <p>Last night's 11th hour compromise was hammered out by Mr Michael and the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, with Labour backbenchers.</p> <p>They accepted a backbench amendment to a government resolution which would have delayed the ban by two years once the parliamentary bill passes into law. The amendment, which reduces the two-year delay to 18 months, will be tabled by the passionately anti-hunting MP Tony Banks, and is being signed by Peter Bradley, Mr Michael's ministerial aide. </p> <p>This 18 months' grace is likely to be the winning option, with the bill and the amended resolution sailing through the Commons today, allowing the measure to be sent to the Lords tomorrow. </p> <p>Such a scenario would present peers, who overwhelmingly support hunting, with a dilemma. They will in effect be challenged to support the amendment and preserve hunting until July 2006, or oppose the bill and possibly see hunting banned within three months of the bill being passed in November, by the invocation of the Parliament Act, which allows certain bills to be passed into law if they are blocked by the upper house.</p> <p>Simon Hart, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, told the BBC this morning: \"Of course, none of this is anything to do with hunting, it is all about the constitution, it is all about internal Labour party wrangling.\" </p> <p>Labour's huge majority in the Commons will almost certainly ensure that MPs vote for a ban tonight. The bill will then got to the Lords tomorrow, who - although a date for a vote has yet to be set - will be equally certain to vote against a ban.</p> <p>The delayed, or phased, end to hunting will allow the government to go in to the next election without a ban in force, but effectively in the position of telling pro-hunters to vote Conservative as the Tories are the only party committed to reinstating hunting.</p> <p>The Countryside Alliance has warned that thousands of rural jobs would disappear among those who earn their living servicing the hunt, including grooms, vets, blacksmiths, feed merchants and farriers. </p> <p>In June 2000 a report ordered by the government said that a ban would see the equivalent of up to 8,000 full-time jobs lost, while pro-hunting groups had claimed 16,000 jobs would be at risk. </p> <p>But the inquiry, chaired by Lord Burns, found that although some local communities, particularly those that were small or isolated, could face a \"painful\" period of readjustment following a ban, the economical impact across the country as a whole would not be substantial. </p> <p>And the effects on local areas, while potentially \"serious\", would be offset in the longer term - between seven and 10 years. </p> <p>Meanwhile, an inquiry by Welsh assembly members in 2002 found that a ban on foxhunting would have a \"limited\" effect on the rural economy.</p>",
  "<p>Cartoon characters and text messaging could be used to give children advice on medicines and sexually transmitted infections, under a strategy launched today to overhaul child health and social care. </p> <p>Using computer games or text messages to remind children to take their medicines were among suggestions to make the NHS more child friendly in the national service framework (NSF) for children, young people and maternity services. </p> <p>The community health minister, Stephen Ladyman, added that testing services and games provided on satellite TV stations such as Cartoon Network and Nikelodeon could provide effective ways to get health advice across to younger children. </p> <p>\"We could use Nickelodeon or the cartoon channel to pass on important information,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Why shouldn't [cult cartoon character] Spongebob Squarepants start delivering some health messages?\"</p> <p>Mr Ladyman said one primary care trust in London was already providing young people with advice on sexual health via text messaging. He said the service allowed teenagers to build up trusting relationships with staff, which would encourage them to visit sexual health clinics. </p> <p>The NSF outlines a 10-year plan for improving the health and social care children, young people and their families should receive. It sets 11 standards that NHS trusts and local authorities must implement by 2014, covering areas such as mental health, medicines, asthma, autism and the needs of disabled children. It states that children should no longer be treated like \"mini-adults\" and must receive care appropriate for their age. </p> <p>The NSF calls for treatment at home for children and young people who have \"complex health needs\", and better speech and language therapy services. </p> <p>It adds there should be early diagnosis and treatment of children with autism and diabetes and mental health problems. </p> <p>Concerns over the use of medication for children is also highlighted as an important issue for doctors, with the emphasis on ensuring the correct drugs and doses are given. The report notes that most drugs are designed for and tested on adults and errors in the prescribing of medicines to children are common and potentially serious. </p> <p>Professor Al Aynsley Green, the government's child health \"tsar\", said the NSF would bring about a fundamental change in the planning and delivery of children's health and social care. He said councils and NHS trusts would be obliged to prove that children's needs were given the same priority as those of adults. </p> <p>The consultant paediatrician said the most pressing priorities were tackling health inequalities, adolescent health and the problems faced by children with disabilities. </p> <p>Mr Ladyman admitted that some elements of the NSF would take longer to implement due to recruitment problems, such as the shortage of midwives.</p> <p>He added that it would be left to local care agencies to decide how and when the NSF will come into effect. \"The timing and how it is implemented locally are matters for local decision,\" he said. </p> <p>Watchdog the Healthcare Commission will check whether the health service is working towards implementation of the NSF when drawing up the annual national league table of NHS trusts.

The path is now clear for the former Manchester United hero to move into club management before the weekend.</p> <p>Hughes technically does not have a release agreement in his contract, but there is a buy-out clause which means that he, or his prospective new employers, must pay compensation, and that gives the FAW room for negotiation.

  "In a few weeks' time, my husband will go to court to explain to a judge why he hasn't seen his two youngest daughters for 10 months. The reason he will give for this enforced and agonising separation is that his ex-wife remains chillingly bitter about their divorce. She could refuse to let them see his children - so she did. Now the onus is on him to prove himself a fit father. It is not for her to justify terminating his relationship with children of just eight and 10. As the law stands, despite government promises of greater parental equality, if a mother wants to prevent her children seeing their father, there is nothing to stop her except a long and costly court battle. <p>When it began, my husband and I were living with his daughter, Emma, 14, his daughter, Sally, then nine, and my son Tom from a previous relationship, then 11. Emma had had no significant relationship with her mum, Alison, since she was eight - Alison's choice. Sally had been living with us for two years, and although there had been rocky moments as we all attempted to adjust to a new family situation, things were settling down and she saw her mum every three weeks or so. My husband's youngest child, Evie, then seven, still lived with Alison - but her relationship with our family was close: visits were twice weekly, and much longer in the holidays. </p> <p>The main problem was money. James and I are both self-employed, and his career as a web designer was suffering because of the amount of time he devoted to the children. He was one parent doing the job of two, while I struggled to earn enough money for us all. Eventually, I couldn't. My career went through a rough patch, court was threatened by our creditors, and we were in danger of losing the house. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Alison was running a successful business, to which she devoted most of her waking hours. She was extremely well-off - and I couldn't understand why James was so reluctant to ask her for a contribution to the upkeep of her daughters. He said she wouldn't consider it; she hated him for leaving her and she viewed money as an emotional tool. </p> <p>Eventually, rightly or wrongly, I persuaded him that our situation was dire enough for him to approach the Child Support Agency (CSA) and make a claim. He did, and all hell broke loose. </p> <p>First, Alison rang Sally and Emma, sobbing, to say that James wanted to send her to prison, and that she would kill herself. When James tried to speak to her, she swore at him and put the phone down. She refused to answer further calls. The children were understandably distraught. We were torn between wanting to explain, and not wanting to drag them into things. </p> <p>Some days later, James and I had to go to a work function. We dropped Tom and Sally at the home of a close friend. During the short time we were away, Alison arrived with Evie. She insisted that Sally come with her \"to talk it through\". We arrived back to find my friend sobbing, Tom traumatised, and no Sally. </p> <p>Sally phoned later to say she \"wanted to stay with her mum for a couple of days\". That was the last time we saw more than a snatched glimpse of her. </p> <p>James drove to the house, Alison wouldn't answer the door. He phoned, she wouldn't take calls. He wrote letters, she didn't reply. </p> <p>Emma rang her mother, who demanded that Emma move in with her. When Emma refused, Alison rang social services and told them that Emma was running wild and possibly taking drugs. She wasn't doing any of those things, but social services investigated. It caused enormous embarrassment to her, and she now has no contact with her mother. </p> <p>James and Emma sent endless texts and emails to Sally and Evie, but there was no reply. Within a week, Alison had moved Sally from a school near us to the school near her where Evie was a pupil. We all went to hover outside the gates to catch sight of them, but when Sally came through the gates, she put her head down and said: \"I don't want to see you, go away.\" Evie cried and clung to her dad the first time, but the next time she said, \"You tried to put my mum in prison,\" and then wouldn't speak. </p> <p>We sent birthday cards and presents, they were returned with \"please do not contact us again\" scrawled in childish handwriting on the envelopes. Other relations who tried to make contact failed too. We dropped the CSA application; it made no difference. Christmas was hell - James sleepwalked through most of it, comatose with grief. Once he went to sit outside Alison's house, hoping to see the children, if only for five minutes. Alison lodged a formal complaint with the police about him \"harrassing\" her, and that resulted in a warning for James. \"You have my every sympathy, sir,\" said the policeman. \"I'm in a similar situation myself, but my hands are tied.\" </p> <p>All our hopes now are pinned on our day in court, when James will ask the judge for the chance to rebuild a relationship with his own children - a relationship that should never have been called into question. As it is, it has come perilously close to being destroyed. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Names and details have been changed.</p>",
  "<p>It is the law now that when you have a baby you must take it to see a \"cranial osteopath\". They are alternative health practitioner-type people who fiddle with your baby, but in a good way. Through gentle manipulation of the head they can, it is said, cure sleeplessness, fartiness or unexplained hours of screaming (the three great ills of western newborns). Often the problem is said to be caused by a long vaginal birth - that or a short caesarean birth; either way, the baby's skull may need realigning. Well, that's the science bit. </p> <p>My baby was a very bad sleeper and had gripey guts - he started pheasants each time he farted. Everyone said: \"Haven't you taken him to the cranial osteopath yet?\" I became ashamed of my shilly-shallying. \"No, I've been meaning to but ... \" My crime was compounded by the fact that the baby had been two months premature, and must surely have a very badly aligned head indeed after all that lying about in an incubator. Even my health visitor, a steady sort, reminded me that a cranial osteopath often seemed to produce good results, even if it was \"a bit alternative\". </p> <p>Eventually, after it had been on my To Do list for eight weeks or so, I looked in the Yellow Pages. I could see no listings for \"cranial\" osteopaths - only plain osteopaths - but I called one anyway. \"Um, do you do cranial osteopathy?\" The man said that no osteopath worth his salt didn't do cranial. I instantly disliked him, and - being mainly English - arranged to see him the following Friday. </p> <p>We arrived early, Jack and I, and loitered about in a slightly shabby conservatory before ringing the bell. A large, hairy man answered it: the osteopath. I was all smiles; he was stern: it was clear that although he was not actually a doctor, he was as important as a doctor - perhaps more so. There was no time for smiles: there was osteopathy to be done. </p> <p>In the treatment room I started chatting, but was gently reproved. I was told to lay the subject down on the table and then to sit down, out of the way. \"What seems to be the problem with him?\" asked the osteopath, after a suitable silence. </p> <p>Ah, there was the thing. I had waited so long to do this that most of Jack's troubles had resolved themselves; once they are three months past their due date, most infants' ills do tend to evaporate. The boy was still waking up three or four times a night but that was about it. It was something though! \"He was premature and he's still not sleeping well ... \" I began. \"Also ... \" - it suddenly came to me - \" ... also his tear duct is blocked. His left eye gets all gummed up.\" </p> <p>The osteopath took Jack's tiny head in his hands; Jack's gurgles turned to screams. I smiled gamely (I am a natural collaborator). \"He's just reacting to my energy,\" said the osteopath, over Jack's puce face. I nodded enthusiastically. A moment later the osteopath froze: he was looking at the tears streaming down from Jack's left eye. \"Did you say his tear duct was blocked?\" There was such a gleam in the man's eyes! He could scarely believe his own power. \"Oh,\" I said, embarrassed, \"I just meant his eye doesn't clean itself properly; he does cry tears. Sorry.\" It was not, after all, a morning for miracles. </p> <p>The osteopath whipped smartly through the rest of the examination. Jack's head, I learned, was a good shape. However, there was a tightness of the bones above the ears; that was no doubt giving him headaches, hence the night waking. I was shown a gentle compression exercise to perform upon his skull each day. When I tried doing it with the osteopath standing over us, Jack began weeping again: clearly his tight bones were causing him agony. Hardly surprising after the start he'd had in life! </p> <p>Then we were back out in the sunshine. The whole consultation - price \u00a335 - had taken less than 15 minutes. (How do they make a profit?) That night, after Jack's bath, I gently squeezed his head as instructed. The pain appeared to have passed - instead of crying, he smiled delightedly up at me. \"Perhaps it was just that horrid man making you cry,\" I said, but I kept this from Jack's father, who had been forced to drive us some distance for the appointment - and then to write out a cheque for the privilege. </p> <p>Jack slept no better after that; needless to say I quickly let the exercises slide. But there are certain things one must do as a good parent, and this was one of them: duty had been served.</p>",
  "On May 21 1914, Emmeline Pankhurst led between 20,000 and 30,000 militant suffragettes (some armed with clubs) to the gates of Buckingham Palace: she wished to speak to the king to ask him why, after almost 50 years of campaigning, women still had not won the right to vote. She was arrested, but her supporters persevered, rushing at the gate and railings and climbing on the crossbars until the police eventually beat them back. There were charges of brutality, and photographs to prove it, but decent citizens felt the suffragettes had brought it on themselves, and that it had damaged their cause. Perhaps it did - certainly many law-abiding suffragists thought so - but it still got them noticed. If nothing else, it gave them a chance to advertise their grievances to to the public and to worry a government that had chosen to ignore them. <p>How fitting, then, that Batman and Robin chose to scale the same walls on Monday in the name of Fathers4Justice. And how nice to see that 90 years on, the same stunt works. Or is the right word ironic? Although the fathers' rights movement often portrays feminists as the enemy, the campaign for father's rights is a direct descendant of the campaign for women's rights. It was women (well, some women) who laid the groundwork in the early 70s by campaigning for fathers to share in the care of their children. </p> <p>The Fathers4Justice may not be everybody's cup of tea, let alone the most feminist. Batman (real name Jason Hatch) has a criminal conviction for harassing his former wife. Yesterday a Daily Mirror reporter claimed to have overheard him and other members of Fathers4Justice being foul-mouthed and misogynist during a drunken evening out with a child in tow. The serious papers were more concerned about the threat to the Queen's safety. They took the fathers as seriously as the cartoon characters they were impersonating. But the point is that everyone saw the picture. And for me, that's progress: it got people talking about fathers. </p> <p>There is no consensus on fathers' rights in Britain today, especially where they impinge on the rights of children and their mothers: the different campaigning groups are all pulling in different directions. Meanwhile, there are still strong prejudices against fathers who care for their children, and these are reflected not just in the law but in the way the law is implemented. </p> <p>Where there are disputes over contact, family courts should work from the premise that children need good relationships with both parents whenever possible, and do their best to make that happen. This is common practice in other parts of northern Europe and most of the Anglophone world - if we wished to go this way in Britain, there is a wealth of good practice. </p> <p>But the will doesn't seem to be there. During the five years I have spent working with campaigners seeking reform in family courts (some working inside the system, others working outside it) I have seen one promising initiative after another condemned to a bureaucratic death. Although there is a growing consensus (duly reflected in many official documents) that non-resident parents in Britain get a very raw deal, that the family courts are a mess, that we must go back to the drawingboard at once - somehow the change that is needed never happens. Every year, tens of thousands of fracturing families are sucked into the clanking machinery of the family courts to be locked into long, expensive, and chaotically managed disputes. They are still assessed by court officials who do not have to be trained to work with children, and whose brief is to determine who is the \"better parent\". If they and/or the judge perceive a dispute to be \"intractable\" it's still acceptable to exclude one parent from children's lives. </p> <p>Because family courts are closed courts that do not have to give a full accounting of themselves, we cannot say how many fathers have lost all contact with their children in this manner, or how many have such little contact that they cease to have meaningful relationships with them. Nor can we say how many mothers suffer the same fate. This part of the story usually gets edited out: non-resident mothers fare badly in family court, too. As for resident mothers who \"win\", because the courts so often exacerbate the disputes they are meant to resolve, they are often left in fear, and poverty, to bring up children alone. The truth about family courts is that they help no one, least of all the children. </p> <p>In spite of a written government commitment to \"consistent and frequent contact\" between parents and children, there are still no guidelines to help implement this commitment, and in spite of an even noisier commitment to parenting agreements (these would allow parents to negotiate who does what in advance, thereby heading off misunderstandings and disagreements), the children's minister, Margaret Hodge, and her minions have yet to come up with the goods. </p> <p>Why? Well, when did you hear of a government that came up with the goods when it thought it didn't have to? That's not quite fair - it's that lack of consensus among interested parties that is helping to stall things. Over the past five years there has been intense debate about these issues in family policy circles, and groups such as Fathers Direct have worked very hard to develop enlightened policies in support of fathers. But groups representing lone parents still remain suspicious of any pilot scheme that might change the way the courts work now. They are concerned, of course, about domestic violence and child abuse, even though practice in more enlightened parts of the world sees these issues as central. </p> <p>The government isn't bringing in these better programmmes because it thinks we don't really want them. In a sense, it is right. No one wants to end up in a tug of war over children. But because we lack a proper system for helping parents through divorce and separation, disputes that might have been resolved quickly turn into long court cases that leave tens of thousands of fathers excluded from their children's lives. Yes, they are desperate. And yes, they look very silly in those outfits. But if you lost your children through no fault of your own, you might wear one too. </p> <p>I don't always like what they do and say, but I'm glad that Fathers4Justice are out there, doing their crazy stunts. I do have one question, though, about their Buckingham Palace attack - did they know Emmeline did it first?</p>",
  "<p>Hardly a week goes by without a new story about tweenies popping up in the papers - last week it was about tweenie girls slapping on the makeup. Tweenies are either too fat, too thin, too selfish, too materialistic, prematurely sexual or frighteningly undeferential. They spend too much time closeted in their bedrooms on their computers/mobile phones, or they are out roaming the streets in feral packs. The bottom line is that they are on the road to ruins: tweenies are close to replacing teenagers as the repository of public angst. </p> <p>It is an amazing turnaround. Until around five years ago, eight- to 12-year-olds were considered the easiest age group for parents to rub along with. Child development gurus largely ignored them. Tweenies were seen as cooperative, keen to please, intent on improving their developing physical and mental skills, and happy to focus on schoolwork. Toddlers and adolescents were the interesting ones, not tweenies. </p> <p>If it ever was that simple, and it almost certainly never was, we now see and know far more. Recent brain and psychological research is giving us new information about what is changing within eight- to 12 -year-old heads. The marketing people have switched on to the extraordinary pester power of this age group. And what we see all around us are pre-teens who are increasingly demanding but also increasingly unsettled by intense peer, social and academic pressures. Mental health problems among them are growing, and these teenage wannabees seem to feel childhood is no longer an acceptable place to be. They're striving to reach that teenage territory that promises a clearer purpose and identity - and more excitement. </p> <p>But tweenies are not teenagers. They are a different breed and their issues are very different, even though their behaviour may at times look similar. Pre-teens are beginning to check out and crystallise their identity - who they think they are. During this process they begin for the first time to measure themselves against people outside their families, from whom they're beginning to separate emotionally. Crucially, tweenies are also trying to make sense of what being a girl or boy means for their core identity. Friends become very important at this stage, because what tweenies are really saying when they chatter to their friends is: \"This is who I think I am [based largely on family feedback]. I think I'm like you. Have I got me right, and do you like me?' </p> <p>Teenagers, on the other hand, are working out who they are going to be as an adult, often by first deciding who they are not like - parents, of course, and their childlike self. They deconstruct themselves before they put themselves back together. This is the danger point when they can potentially fall apart. However, the stronger and more positive their pre-teen identity, the less chance they will \"lose\" themselves, drift and become clinically depressed during adolescent self-searching. That is why the tweenie stage of development is so important. </p> <p>The problem is that there is a real danger that the confidence that should blossom naturally during the pre-teens is today being undermined by a raft of corrosive pressures. Today's tweenies must cope with many months of uncertainty as they face the anticipation of, and then adjustment to, two school changes (infant to junior and junior to secondary), combined with the repeated stress of testing and monitoring. Parents are asked to help with homework but children often find them negative and undermining. Often there is the stress of finding and getting into the best and most suitable secondary school. </p> <p>Then there are the commercial pressures. Peer pressure really begins to bite from the age of eight, and that is exploited by companies. Everything tweenies wear, eat, use and do has become a marketed fashion statement. Trends sweep through playgrounds like a Mexican wave of wanting and any ridicule for being different is acutely hurtful because these children are at an age when they are desperate to fit in. It's a nightmare for both parents and children to keep up. And if this isn't enough to take the stuffing out of tweenies, many will be unsettled by family break-ups and all the problems that go with them. </p> <p>The pressure may mount after school as competitive parents, keen for their tweenies to start young and excel, crowd out play time with extra classes and training. Children don't know whether to feel confident and competent with their newly acquired skills, or self-doubting because they are now so aware of what they don't have or can't do. And the confusion of those aged 10 to 12 is compounded by a major pre-adolescent refit of neural connections in the brain that blurs their social and emotional senses. It is not easy being a tweenie. </p> <p>Our role as parents is to understand what changes our tweenies are going through and why they are vulnerable, and help them develop that all-important confidence and self-awareness that will help carry them through adolescence. Giving a child confidence is a difficult thing to get right, though - a delicate balance. But encouraging autonomy helps. When a younger tweenie wants to stop sharing a bedroom, then listen to them. When he wants to quit the violin lessons or the ballet, his view should be respected. Tweenies should be treated as a source of authority about themselves. They also need more personal space, and this should be allowed. Many start to feel uncomfortable about us helping in or having more contact with school, and this is because they relish school as their first bit of real private territory. </p> <p>But the move towards greater autonomy and freedom should be gradual. Too much freedom given now cannot easily be retrieved later. Allowing a 10-year-old to disappear into his ultra hi-tech bedroom all day, eat what and when he wants and duck out of every family outing isn't a great idea. We need to stay close - while beginning to let go. It is also important to keep on talking. If the habit of conversation and family fun disappears now, it will be hard to reinstate it during the rockier teenage years when more important issues will almost certainly be at stake. </p> <p>Being around for tweenies is vital. They may behave as though they need parents a lot less than they did, but they still do best when they believe both parents care. If they feel neglected, they will not have the level of self-belief that helps them thrive. And this isn't something you can buy your way out of: getting them new trainers is not the same as showing real interest and taking the trouble to talk to them about their fears, feelings, successes and values. Buying them too much stuff can actually damage their sense of self-worth. If we give in to peer pressure and host, for example, the ultimate Hollywood-style birthday party to go one better than the last classmate's event, or always supply the latest must-have item, we may teach them that what you have really does matter more than who you are. </p> <p>Tweenies can be delightful and huge fun as they become more confident and try themselves out. It is a tragedy when their emerging sense of humour, their newly acquired, fresh-faced wisdom and their excitement and enthusiasm for the world are damaged by the uncertainties and inappropriate expectations that increasingly bear down on children of their age. It is up to parents and schools to help them through to avoid the worst of the rockier times ahead. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Talking to Tweenies: Getting It Right Before It Gets Rocky with Your 8-12 Year Old, by Elizabeth Hartley-Brewer, is published by Hodder Mobius, price \u00a310.99.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday September 16 2004</strong></p> <p> In editing the letter from Christopher Heginbotham below, we removed the reference to its subject - the draft mental health bill, published last week. The letter is printed under a heading relating to the subject of another letter - the mental capacity bill. The two bills are quite distinct, if related. Mr Heginbotham is talking about the mental health bill.</p> <p> </p> <p> I was disappointed to read the comments by Simone Aspis of Changing Perspectives on the mental capacity bill (Letters, September 10). It is wrong to say that the bill will give informal carers almost unlimited power to control people's lives. It will do the opposite. </p> <p>The bill promotes autonomy and independence for people who may lack capacity. It starts from the principle that a person must be assumed to have capacity unless proven otherwise. The bill then requires that the person should be helped to make his or her own decision, or to participate in the decision. People may not be labelled or treated as incapable following a particular diagnosis - the bill sets out for the first time in statute that decisions about capacity must be specific to the decision to be taken at the time. </p> <p>People will only be able to act without someone's consent where there are objective grounds for believing that an individual lacks capacity. And they must be able to show that they are acting in the best interests of that person. This applies to carers at home as well as to professionals, such as doctors. </p> <p>It is also wrong to say there is no redress available under the bill; it will establish a new specialist and accessible court where people can challenge decisions made. We will continue to work with the I Decide coalition, and the many other stakeholders with an interest in the mental capacity bill, to ensure that it brings about improvements for vulnerable people.<br> <strong>Catherine Ashton</strong><br> Department for Constitutional Affairs </p> <p>It is true that in some respects the reasons for treating someone are more tightly defined in the draft bill than in current law, but this is overshadowed by remaining questions over who could be made subject to the redrafted bill's powers. First, the definition of mental disorder remains vague and has not been qualified by exclusion (as in the current act). Second, the bill proposes to replace the current \"treatability\" rules with a requirement that \"treatment is available which is appropriate in the patient's case\". This shifts the emphasis from whether an intervention will have therapeutic benefits for the patient, to a rather vague consideration of whether it is \"appropriate\"' in all the circumstances of a case.<br> <strong> Christopher Heginbotham</strong><br> Mental Health Act Commission</p>",

  "<p>For the past three years, Cheryl, 27, has been employed as a project worker for a children's charity that helps homeless teenagers. She earns \u00a325,500. The health promotion aspect of her job has been particularly enjoyable, and she wonders whether her experience might allow her to move into the public health sector.</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Cheryl could consider becoming a young person's health adviser for a primary care trust earning up to \u00a333,000. She would work with other agencies to develop health promotion and prevention strategies. Her understanding of the health issues facing young people is more important than clinical knowledge.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> With her professional social work qualification, Cheryl could join a community mental health team as a social worker and train as a specialist in mental health. With more experience she could become a mental health facilitator, with health promotion and prevention responsibilities, working for a primary care trust. Her salary would rise to between \u00a327,000 and \u00a331,000.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Cheryl's social care background is an asset if she wants to become a health development worker for a primary care trust. Her knowledge of young people and understanding of how to improve the public health of teenagers is an advantage. The job offers broad experience, as she would work with individual groups and make strategy proposals, and comes with a \u00a329,000 salary.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Good communication skills with young people are essential if Cheryl wants to be a specialist health adviser in teenage pregnancy. She would need to have an understanding of the wider issues around the subject and be up to date with the political agenda on sexual health. A junior health promotion role with a primary care trust is a popular route for people with social care backgrounds because it offers the opportunity to develop expertise. Cheryl would need to study for a MSc in public health or health promotion if she wanted a more strategic role in the future. The salary is around \u00a325,000. </p> <p><strong>5</strong> Working as a smoking cessation adviser for adults and young people is a possibility for Cheryl. Her lack of clinical knowledge is not a disadvantage, while her good interpersonal skills, experience of working with health professionals and ability to be non-judgmental are all assets that make her an attractive candidate.

  "<p>Local companies and charities will be given a vote on regional assemblies, without being elected to them, it emerged today.</p> <p>The prospect of unelected businessmen and others within an area governed by a regional assembly having the vote alongside democratically elected assembly members was confirmed today by the local government minister, Nick Raynsford, at the second evidence session on the draft regional assemblies bill.</p> <p>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's select committee heard that the onus on stakeholder engagement within regional English government would allow assemblies to award voting powers on a given set of issues, in order to reassure businesses, charities and other groups that they held sway over regional decision-making.</p> <p>Asked by Labour MP David Clelland whether stakeholders would be able to vote to ensure they participated in issues facing the region, Mr Raynsford confirmed the government was keen to see this happen. \"We are not going to exclude that possibility,\" he said \"We think regional assemblies should be able to consider it but there are some things that must be decided only by elected members. \"</p> <p>He added: \"We would like to see scope for active participation. We will encourage it with guidance.\"</p> <p>Regional governments should not be a \"command and control\" centre for the region but instead should operate through active partnership with the private, public and voluntary sectors, Mr Raynsford told the panel of MPs.</p> <p>Failure to engage all groups could leave a regional assembly open to judicial review, he added. </p> <p>The minister was speaking the day after the Electoral Commissioned confirmed the two organisations that will receive campaign funding to lobby the public for or against a proposed regional government in the north east. </p> <p>Yes4theNorthEast and North East Says No will each receive \u00a3100,000 of government money to campaign in the run up to the November 4 referendum. </p> <p>The regional assemblies draft bill, published in late July, lays out the main powers that a regional government will wield and will give voters a greater sense of what they are voting for. </p> <p>Subject to a \"yes\" referendum vote, a fuller, more comprehensive bill will be introduced and be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p> <p>Mr Raynsford said referendums in the north-west and Yorkshire and Humber were likely to go ahead next autumn, following the decision to postpone them because of the current lack of enthusiasm for the project in the two regions.</p> <p> He confirmed that any assembly's \"broad powers\" would be circumscribed to ensure that a regional government would not \"trample on\" or \"usurp\" local government powers, and to avoid the duplication of roles. </p> <p>Any takeover of local government by regions would be \"undesirable\", he said. </p> <p>However, it emerged that councils could still see some of their powers taken over in the long-term, as Mr Raynsford admitted that he would resist demands aired by the Local Government Association to make all existing council functions beyond the reach of assemblies. </p> <p>\"We intend to introduce additional clauses to specify defined local authority functions that would be off limits to regional assemblies so yes, we are sympathetic to that,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The LGA asked for a blanket provision saying that no functions discharged by local government should be transferred but frankly, I could not commit to that ... we have to be measured, we have given assurances. </p> <p>\"It is not our intention to take powers away from local government. We have explained how legislation as presently constituted meets that commitment and we will continue to honour that. But I could not accept a complete ban on any transfer of powers. I think that would be overly restrictive.\"</p>",
  "Speaking at the American Film Renaissance's small opening-night reception at the Dallas Intercontinental last Friday, the rightwing film critic Michael Medved claimed: \"The huge success of The Passion of the Christ has changed western culture permanently and forever.\" He was simply stunned, he said, that Hollywood was not trying to cash in on the shift. <p>\"What is it about one of the most profitable movies in history that they don't understand?\" he asked, as a crowd of about 50 festival-goers nibbled miniature roast beef sandwiches, spring rolls and empanadas. \"There is something wrong here! There is a very real problem! The problem is not that people objected to the movie because it was anti-Jewish.\" Indeed, he said, the charges of anti-semitism were \"sick, twisted and demagogic\". </p> <p>\"They opposed it not because it was anti-Jewish,\" he said, \"but because it was pro-Christian.\"</p> <p>Like so many of the people at the inaugural American Film Renaissance festival, Medved spoke with an easygoing, Rotary Club ordinariness that belied the seething anger underneath. There was none of Zell Miller's fire and brimstone in his voice as he blandly called for more demeaning portrayals of gay people in the mass media, saying, \"Every single image of homosexuality you see on TV is positive. It's not only positive, it's glowing. It's saintly. When was the last time you saw a nasty gay character? A degraded gay character?\" </p> <p>Medved is a bigot, but he's also on to something. Many people on the coasts have not reckoned with the true cultural complexion of vast swaths of this country. They tend to make movies and write articles and produce albums as if their fellow citizens inhabited the same reality that they do, but there is another world in America: a through-the-looking-glass universe in which conservative Christians, despite dominating all the branches of government, feel persecuted by the state, in which gun control is seen as the natural precursor to genocide, and Bill Clinton is suspected of covering up Iraqi responsibility for the Oklahoma City bombings. Residents of this febrile realm believe they are the majority and that sinister, cringing liberals are denying them their cultural due. Convinced that the film industry is conspiring against them, they want to create a corn fed Hollywood of their very own, from the grassroots up. </p> <p>According to the story that festival founder Jim Hubbard, 35, told repeatedly to journalists and attendees, he was inspired to create the American Film Renaissance after he and his wife, a pretty, bouffant blonde named Ellen, went to an art house theatre one night and were distressed to find that their only choices were Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine and the Frida Kahlo biopic, Frida, about \"a communist artist\". </p> <p>\"Where are the films for normal people?\" he asked. </p> <p>The American Film Renaissance was created to give films for \"normal people\" -- in this iteration, the far right -- an outlet. It was held at Dallas's Studio Movie Grill, a theatre with waiter service where audiences can order burgers, pizza, nachos and other greasy snacks while they watch movies. According to Hubbard, the timing was not intentional, but September. 11 was invoked over and over again in the festival's selections, the burning towers shown to punctuate all sorts of arguments about liberal treachery. </p> <p>Hundreds of people turned up, some travelling cross country for the experience. David Goodman, owner of a New Jersey DVD distribution company, bought several titles, and says he will soon have them in megastores such as Wal-Mart. \"This is the counterbalance to Outfoxed, he says, speaking of Robert Greenwald's recent documentary about Fox News. \"This is the counterbalance to Bush's Brain and Fahrenheit 9/11.</p> <p>One of the films Goodman picked up was The Siege of Western Civilisation, the 45-minute fledgling effort by Herb Meyer, a 58-year-old who once served as vice-chairman of the CIA's national intelligence council under President Reagan. An avuncular, moon-faced man with bright, engaged eyes, Meyer speaks with disarming calm about the second civil war he believes the US is currently fighting, a war his film seeks to explain as it bounces from the dangers posed by al-Qaida to those posed by liberalism and low birthrates. </p> <p>\"There are those who wish to turn us from a Judaeo-Christian into a secular culture,\" he explains, sitting in the Intercontinental lounge. \"This really is a kind of civil war. This is not normal politics. We are two cultures in one country. That has never happened before. I'm not sure we can survive, where half of us think marriage is between a man and a woman and half think a man can marry his goldfish.\"</p> <p>For all the risk that liberalism poses to the nation, Meyer is sanguine about his side's imminent victory. \"It's panic time for the liberals,\" he says. Medved echoed him, saying: \"Secular people in America know very well they are outnumbered. They know very well they are outclassed, and they are in fear.\" </p> <p>Judging by the American Film Renaissance, though, the right has quite a ways to go before it can take on Hollywood. Most of the entries were far more crudely made than the documentaries they aim to challenge. Several entries, including Meyer's apocalyptic home video, amounted to little more than a single guy spinning theories before the camera. It was a festival about reaction, not creation, devoted largely to conspiracy theories and attacks on liberal culture. Of the two narrative features shown, one of them, DC 9/11: Time of Crisis, a hagiographic (and roundly criticised) account of George Bush's response to the World Trade Centre attacks, aired more than a year ago on Showtime and has just been released on DVD.</p> <p>One of the more amusingly bad selections was Jack Cashill's Mega Fix, in which Cashill, a thin, craggy man with a reassuringly amiable voice, delivers a lunatic monologue about Bill Clinton and terrorism. According to Cashill, a columnist for WorldNet Daily, Islamic terrorists, some with ties to Iraq, were behind the Oklahoma City bombing, the downing of Flight 800 and the bombing at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Clinton, corrupt and pusillanimous, covered all this up because he didn't want to go to war. His Justice Department preferred to pin the blame for Oklahoma City on \"these two perfect specimens of rightwing American manhood\" because it would help them discredit Newt Gingrich and the Republican revolutionists of 1994. </p> <p>Amazingly, Cashill's film wasn't the most outlandish documentary on offer. It was trumped by Innocents Betrayed, which attributes most of the 20th century's genocides, as well as lynching, the Japanese-American internment and the rape of Nanking to gun control. Jumping from country to country, it first explains how a particular government passed laws limiting the ownership of weapons, and then cuts to pornographic montages of mutilated corpses. Walking out, a conservative journalist from Washington looked at me and said, \"OK, that was offensive.\" </p> <p>Weak as the festival's films were, the event represented a new front in the right's ongoing project of creating a parallel popular culture for denizens of the red states, a project that has been notably successful in other areas. There is Fox News. There is the Left Behind series, the bestselling books of fiction in America. As Adam Green reported in the New Yorker, the \"frantic, aggressive, and caustic\" rightwing comic Brad Stine is playing to packed houses and developing a sitcom. There are Christian rock acts who in many cases look indistinguishable from their MTV counterparts and who draw crowds as large as many bands we think of as mainstream. Even as this year's Lollapalooza was cancelled due to poor ticket sales and the press was full of stories about a summer concert slump, the Christian rock Creation Festival in Pennsylvania drew 50,000, more than Lollapalooza garnered in the same state at its height in the mid-1990s. </p> <p>The success of Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 was clearly the animating force for the festival. But the would-be auteurs seemed unable to grasp the inclusive, populist approach of Moore's film-making. Sure, progressives hate Bush, but most don't want to crush his followers; the film-makers at the American Renaissance, though, direct their fury at anonymous, everyday lefties at least as much as at Democratic politicians. Liberal-baiting was the weekend's preferred sport. Some of the loudest cheers came after a short film from the Protest Warriors, a group that specialises in barrelling into antiwar protests with rightwing signs, waiting for the inevitable obnoxious punks to start screaming and pushing them, and then capturing it all on video as proof of the fascism lurking beneath liberal bromides. </p> <p>Operation Eagle Strike, made by Protest Warriors Kfir Alfia and Alan Davidson, was part of a programme of shorts. The bill included a sympathetic look at the exploits of Ann Coulter and a 45-minute documentary about double standards and \"PC\" excesses on college campuses called Brainwashing 101. The latter was one of the better things in the festival, capturing very real abuses of conservative students' First Amendment rights by doctrinaire administrators and hysterical speech codes. It included an account of a college Republican dragged through a gruelling disciplinary process after hanging a flyer for a conservative event at his campus's multicultural centre, an incident that should rile civil libertarians of all persuasions. </p> <p>The Protest Warriors told a far less convincing tale of conservative struggle. A story about a confrontation between two sets of braying ideologues, it was filmed at an October antiwar demonstration in Washington that was sponsored by the loathsome Stalinist sect ANSWER. </p> <p>ANSWER, which is actually pro-Saddam Hussein and pro-Kim Jong Il, is the fulfilment of every rightwing fantasy about the left, and it made a succulent target for the young Protest Warriors. They, in turn, labour mightily to match their enemies in mulish righteousness. </p> <p>While introducing Alfia and Davidson at the festival, Hubbard called them \"the bravest people I've ever met\". Their work, such as it is, seems designed to bolster that image - without requiring any actual risk. Operation Eagle Strike begins with Alfia and Davidson standing, arms crossed, before the Capitol building. \"The left is about to find out while they can protest America, we can protest them,\" Davidson says. \"One of our central tenets about the left is that all their issues are just vessels that just carry water for their true, sinister agenda: the destruction of freedom, the destruction of morality, the destruction of America.\" </p> <p>Then Alfia intones: \"Protest Warriors, let's go to battle.\" This is followed by the sound of a siren and computer graphics suggestive of cheap spy movies, with a line tracing across a map to its target -- the assembled traitors at the Washington National Mall. Inspirational music swells as the Protest Warriors are shown meeting, gathering their signs and saying the pledge of allegiance. The soundtrack becomes warlike as they start walking to confront their enemies. </p> <p>At the mall, they have a standoff with some shrill ANSWERites, who chant: \"No more violence, no more hate.\" The Warriors boldly confront a leftist pamphlet seller, asking him, \"All the Iraqi people who have since been released from torture chambers and dungeons: do you think they are glad you're not calling the shots?\" This gets a hearty laugh from the packed theatre. </p> <p>For all their professions of patriotism, the Protest Warriors are weirdly disrespectful of real soldiers when they co-opt military motifs to give their face-offs with skinny anarchists and angry hippies the frisson of danger. In many ways, they are the distillate of the Bush-era right: paragons of smugness who confuse martial iconography with physical courage. They are hot to do battle with America's foes -- not by actually fighting them abroad but by patrolling the borders of acceptable rhetoric here at home. </p> <p>Being around people who are so defensive about national greatness makes one wonder what private anxieties are driving them. True pride, after all, is rarely strident and bellicose. I suspect thatjust as there is no one more homophobic than a closet case, so those most enraged by criticism of America harbour some secret suspicion that it is accurate. How else to explain a documentary like Michael Moore Hates America? </p> <p>One of two anti-Michael Moore films to show at the festival, Michael Wilson's Michael Moore Hates America was easily the most interesting movie there and the only one likely to make it to real theatres. (Wilson says he is in talks with distributors and is expecting an October release.) While its competitor, Michael and Me, an anti-gun control jeremiad by the radio talkshow host Larry Elder, was tedious and predictable, Wilson's movie had surprising nuance and commendable sincerity, though not enough to make up for the thuggish bathos at its core. </p> <p>What's strange about Michael Moore Hates America is that Wilson, a beefy, 28-year-old from Minnesota, seems motivated by a real sense of wounded shock that another portly Midwesterner could criticise his country the way Moore does. </p> <p>\"Michael Moore had pissed me off,\" says Wilson's voiceover at the beginning of the film. \"This guy had painted a picture of my country where no one can succeed.\" Wilson is angry about Moore's distortions and ethical corner-cutting, but more than that he seems hurt by Moore's failure to embrace corporate capitalism. </p> <p>Early on, he talks about how his father was laid off from his blue-collar job but did not let economic hardship impinge on his patriotism. Wilson recalls his words: \"'In America', he said, 'if you work hard, you can make it.'\" A little later there's a shot of Wilson holding his newborn baby daughter. \"Because my father had passed his faith on to me, I knew she could live any life she could dream. But Michael Moore had told her she couldn't!\" </p> <p>Wilson spends much of his movie dogging Moore, just as Moore dogged the General Motors CEO, Roger Smith, in his 1989 film Roger &amp; Me. He says he just wants 45 minutes to discuss how two guys from the Midwest could see the world so differently. Moore, understandably put off by the title of Wilson's project, refuses to talk to him. </p> <p>Of course, Moore has done much to earn this irksome homunculus: his distortions don't begin to rival those of, say, Fox News or the Bush administration, but he does tend to bulldoze over inconvenient facts in the service of his arguments. In Fahrenheit 9/11, for example, he strongly implies that the war in Afghanistan was motivated by Unocal's desire to build a natural gas pipeline, a theory that has been discredited by analysts across the political spectrum, and he paints prewar Iraq as an Edenic land of kite-flying children. </p> <p>Wilson cleverly and persistently calls Moore on some of his misrepresentations. He visits the bank where Moore got a free gun in Bowling for Columbine and finds out that it doesn't ordinarily hand out weapons on site. The guns were usually kept in a vault 300 miles away but the bank's employees said Moore had pressured them to give him his gun in person and on camera. He told them he was working on a film about unusual businesses. </p> <p>Wilson also tracks down a soldier who lost his arms in Iraq and who appears in Fahrenheit 9/11 via footage taken by a news crew. An avid supporter of the war, the soldier is furious about being drafted into Moore's movie. \"I don't want any part of your propaganda,\" he says. \"No one sent me over there. I sent myself over there. We all knew there's a chance we could get killed. We're not idiots.\" </p> <p>For all his outrage over Moore's tactics, though, Wilson is just as given to cheap shots and unearned conclusions. Accusing Moore of lionising Canada, he goes there and finds two inarticulate street kids to represent it. There's a long, pointless segment in which he profiles two men who have started their own small businesses in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan, which is apparently supposed to demonstrate that Moore exaggerated the area's economic hardship. Of course, a person could have also found a few thriving entrepreneurs during the great depression. It proves exactly nothing about the larger economic reality. </p> <p>Wilson seems to pride himself on his open mind, but he often seems either naive or wilfully blind. That is true in person, as well. Over drinks at the Intercontinental on Saturday night I suggest to Wilson that, although Moore might have erred in using an unsuspecting and unwilling amputee to illustrate his point, things in Iraq are indeed awful and many soldiers feel marooned and furious. A voluble chain smoker with platinum streaks in his hair, Wilson replies: \"I've talked to tons of soldiers who say it's like a fourth of July parade every time they roll into town.\" Perhaps because of all the explosions. </p> <p>Most irritating of all is Wilson's titular accusation. Part of the political fallout from 9/11 has been the emergence of cultural vigilantes who have taken it upon themselves to defame the insufficiently jingoistic. In his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1962 book Anti-Intellectualism in American Life, the historian Richard Hofstadter wrote of American intellectuals' historic ambivalence toward their country and of \"the tension between protest and affirmation that had been most often associated with great achievement\". In trying to root out the element of protest in national thought - all while paying insincere lip service to their respect for dissent - people like Wilson make themselves the enemies of intellect. They become the enforcers and purveyors of the most squalid Philistinism. </p> <p>In his movie, Wilson seems genuinely disturbed by the degree of the polarisation of America. He leaves an interview with the rightwing Jacobin David Horowitz unnerved by Horowitz's shrillness. Part of him wants to broker a truce between the warring Americas that Herb Meyer speaks of.

  "<p>British Airways today announced the cancellation of almost 1,000 flights over the next three months in an effort to ease congestion at Heathrow, one of the world's busiest airports.</p> <p>BA, Europe's second-biggest airline, is to cut 996 flights - 2% of total operations or 12 flights a day, on domestic, European and long-haul destinations. </p> <p>\"We have done a prudent precautionary measure which relieves some pressure on the flying programme at what is a very busy airport,\" a BA spokesman said. </p> <p>But the move will hardly inspire confidence among passengers after last month's disruptions, when BA was forced to cancel flights because of staff shortages and technical problems. </p> <p>The unions accuse BA of digging itself into a hole by axing too many staff in a restructuring programme that has seen the loss of 13,000 jobs since the September 11 2001 attacks in the US. </p> <p>\"These cancellations might take a bit of pressure off, but if BA had listened to us last year and not cut the number of operational staff to the bone it would not be in this position,\" said the GMB union's national officer, Ed Blissett. </p> <p>BA, which said it was recruiting new staff into areas such as check-in, is expected to consider the outcome of an inquiry into last month's cancellations on Friday amid speculation some senior managers may lose their jobs over the problem. </p> <p>On today's cancellations, BA airline said only high-frequency routes would be affected, including flights to New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, and short-haul routes to Edinburgh, Manchester, Frankfurt, Munich, Brussels and Amsterdam. </p> <p>Analysts said the cancellations were not expected to affect BA financially, although they might hurt its image. \"You would hope that by doing it there was a gain because you would reduce the scope for disruption,\" independent airline analyst Chris Tarry told Reuters. \"You are putting some more buffers in the system so it actually works.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>\"Will Wayne Rooney be the first Scouser to play for Manchester United?\"</strong> asks Alex Freudmann.</p> <p>The answer, quite simply, is no. But here's Richard Bryce to provide a little background information. \"Young Wayne will be the eighth Scouser to pull on the red shirt of Manchester United,\" he begins. \"The most illustrious predecessor was Croxteth-born Steve Coppell, who played almost 400 games for United between 1975 and 1983, and 42 for England.</p> <p>\"Before him, Liverpudlians Willie Anderson and Albert Kinsey played ten times and once respectively in the sixties and Ted Connor played 15 matches between 1909 and 1911, with Arthur Marshall notching up six in 1902-03.\"</p> <p>There's more. \"Neither is Rooney the first Scouser to sign from Everton. Alf Schofield joined Newton Heath (as United were then called) from Everton in 1900 and played 179 games until retiring in 1907. More recently, John Gidman racked up 115 games in United red after signing from the Toffees in 1981.\"</p> <p>As several of you point out, Peter Davenport, who scored 26 goals for United between 1986 and 1988, may also be added to the list, though it depends whether you consider his birthplace Birkenhead to be a Scouse area.</p> <p><strong>ENGLAND WITHOUT A MAN UNITED PLAYER</strong></p> <p><strong>\"After Gary Neville was substituted against Poland, the England team contained no players from Manchester United,\"</strong> chuckles Martin Kinrade. <strong>\"When was the last time this happened?\"</strong></p> <p>It seemed like a really good question - but the answer is actually last month, against Ukraine, when Gary Neville and Alan Smith were both brought off at half-time. In fact, you don't even have to go back too far to find when an England team last <em>started</em> without a United player: October 10, 1999, in a 2-1 win over Belgium at Sunderland's Stadium Of Light. For the record, the starting line-up that day was: Seaman; Keown, Adams, Southgate; Dyer, Ince, Redknapp, Lampard, Guppy; Shearer, Phillips.</p> <p>More significant, perhaps, is the last time England began a <em>competitive</em> match without a United player. The answer? That fateful night of June 26, 1996, when they lost to Germany in the Euro '96 semi-final.</p> <p>Gary Neville was suspended, David Beckham was six weeks away from changing his life from the halfway line at Selhurst Park, Paul Scholes was a supersub, Teddy Sheringham was a Spurs player, and Phil Neville was sat with his brother on the England bench. The starting XI that night - as you all should know, of course - was: Seaman; Adams, Southgate, Pearce; McManaman, Platt, Ince, Gascoigne, Anderton; Sheringham, Shearer.</p> <p><strong>ENGLAND WITH <em>THREE</em> SPURS PLAYERS</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Before last week, when did Spurs last have three players in an England starting line-up?\"</strong> asks Rob Crowley. <strong>\"Was it really in the 1970s?\"</strong></p> <p>Not quite - in fact it was May 1987, when Glenn Hoddle (about to leave for Monaco and Arsene Wenger), Chris Waddle and Steve Hodge lined up in a 0-0 draw away to Scotland.</p> <p>A month earlier, however, England had <em>five</em> Tottenham players in the starting line-up away to Turkey: Hoddle, Waddle, Hodge, Clive Allen and Gary Mabbutt. It didn't stop them drawing 0-0, mind.</p> <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</strong></p> <p><strong>\"I remember reading that when the Premiership began, there were only nine foreigners (not counting Irish, Welsh or Scottish) attached to Premiership clubs.

The actual number of foreign (not UK and Ireland) players in their team's starting line-ups when the Premier League began in 1992-93 was ten - with two more coming on as substitutes.</p> <p>As Simon Gleave points out, \"The ten starters were John Jensen (Arsenal), Anders Limpar (Arsenal), Eric Cantona (Leeds United), Michel Vonk (Manchester City), Peter Schmeichel (Manchester United), Andrei Kanchelskis (Manchester United), Gunnar Halle (Oldham Athletic), Jan Stejskal (QPR), Roland Nilsson (Sheffield Wednesday) and Hans Segers (Wimbledon).</p> <p>\"Robert Warzycha (Everton) came on as a substitute that weekend, as did Ronnie Rosenthal (Liverpool),\" he adds. \"So, the foreign legion on the opening weekend of the Premiership comprised of two Danes, two Dutchmen, two Swedes, a Pole, a Frenchman, a Ukrainian (who played internationally for Russia), a Norwegian, an Israeli and a Czech.\"</p> <p>For more classic knowledge, click <a href=\" http://football.theguardian.com/theknowledge\">here</a></p> <p><strong>Can you help?</strong></p> <p>\"Has there ever been a deaf professional footballer?\" asks Clinton Mansell.</p> <p>Send your questions and answers to <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">knowledge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Tony Blair's spring wobble when he seriously considered stepping down as prime minister was driven by \"personal and family\" pressures, and not by the political controversies raging around him, an old friend suggested yesterday. <p>The Labour peer, Melvyn Bragg, whose wife, Cate Haste, co-authored Cherie Blair's new book on Downing Street spouses, made the claim during an interview with ITV News which caught No 10 on the hop. </p> <p>Asked by Alastair Stewart if Mr Blair \"nearly did go and call it a day\", Lord Bragg was clearly determined to be both discreet and loyal to the Blairs, but also to Labour's heir-apparent, Gordon Brown. </p> <p>\"I think that he [Mr Blair] was under tremendous stress. He was being hammered in the press. Perhaps he had doubts about some policies, perhaps not. </p> <p>\"But in my view, the real stress was personal and family, which matters most to him. And my guess is that the considerations of his family became very pressing and that was what made him think things over very carefully. That is my guess,\" he said. </p> <p>Though Lord Bragg later explained that he was not suggesting matrimonial problems - \"I have never seen a couple get on as good as those two\" - he repeated that his guess was that the \"colossal strain\" earlier this year was the result of pressures of family life. </p> <p>The Blairs have four children, several siblings and three living parents, including Leo Blair senior, who is now frail and Tony Booth, the actor and old Labour activist who has hounded successive Labour premiers, including his son-in-law. His ex-wife acts as a nanny to Leo junior, four. </p> <p>Lord Bragg's remarks come after weeks of speculation about Mr Blair's intentions and the understanding, if any, he has reached with the chancellor about a smooth transfer of power when the time comes. </p> <p>One version of events, reported this week, suggested that Mr Blair had even considered announcing that he would stand down, not immediately, but before the coming election. </p> <p>He was allegedly talked out of it by senior colleagues, notably John Prescott and Mr Brown himself, because a pre-announced delay would be highly disruptive. No 10 officials and Blair allies deny that explanation.</p> <p>Last night Mr Blair's official spokesman said: \"I must admit it took us by surprise as much as anybody else. I don't know why he said it. What Lord Bragg said is a matter for Lord Bragg and not for us.\"</p> <p>He drew attention to Mr Blair's public denial that he had ever thought of quitting, made in July.</p> <p>Whatever the truth of the wobble and its causes, those close to Mr Brown insist that he did talk his old friend out of stepping down this spring, not least because it would lead to a turbulent pre-election leadership contest - despite Mr Brown's near-certainty of victory.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday September 28 2004</strong></p> <p> Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash) has informed us that it was mistaken in the salt content it attributed to Sainsbury's breakfast cereal. In the article below we quote Cash as saying the cereal has 1.84g of salt per portion. In fact, it has significantly less salt, as the packaging makes clear. Cash has apologised to Sainsbury's for its error. </p> <p> </p> <p> Civilisation is built on salt. The discovery of its power to preserve food enabled wandering tribes to put down roots. Men and women could hunt and gather today and eat tomorrow. A life that was no longer hand to mouth allowed time to sit and think. Salt became as precious as any metal, was traded between nations and offered as gifts. Its influence lingers in our linguistic value judgments: a good man is the salt of the earth and worth his salt, but a social inferior sits below it. </p> <p>But the white crystals have lost their magic. \"It wasn't a gift for civilisation. It was a poison,\" says Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine and the one man who has probably done more than any other to shake our confidence in a substance traditionally offered with bread as a sign of friendship to strangers. </p> <p>MacGregor is chairman of Cash (Consensus Action on Salt and Health) and is this week savouring the sweet taste of success. Ten years after he and fellow experts on blood pressure began pressing for limits on the amount of salt we eat, which they say is implicated in 120,000 heart attack deaths a year in the UK, the Food Standards Authority has launched a \u00a34m campaign to persuade us to eat less of it - and manufacturers to cut the sackfuls they pour into our processed foods. </p> <p>But it isn't the salt on your table that does the damage - it's the salt in your lasagne and, more alarmingly, your bread. The FSA says that 75% of our salt comes from processed foods, and that an adult consumes 9.5g a day, though we don't need more than 6g. Baked beans, breakfast cereals, pizza, soup and cooking sauces tend to be salt-lavish, but so are some sweet foods, such as biscuits and hot chocolate. </p> <p>Why does our food contain so much salt? Not only because manufacturers found it made their products taste more interesting, but also because it binds in water, thus cheaply adding \"texture\" or bulk. It also makes you thirsty - another knock-on effect for the food and drink industry. </p> <p>MacGregor argues that thousands of lives could be saved by cutting the salt content of processed foods by 10-20%. \"If salt intake was reduced to 6g a day, it would prevent 70,000 heart attacks per year, 35,000 of which are fatal. It is as big an improvement as when they put drains into London,\" he says. </p> <p>Unusually for a bunch of scientists, Cash is extremely media-savvy. It was naming and shaming high-salt foods, lambasting individual manufacturers and barbecuing supermarkets long before health minister Melanie Johnson got in on the act. This month it scored a direct hit on Sainsbury's, fingering the company's \"Be good to yourself\" flakes and orchard fruits as one of \"the UK's saltiest foods\". One 50g portion contained 1.84g of salt, it said. Sainsbury's immediately pulled the product off the shelves. </p> <p>Back in 1994, the government's advisory Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition (known as Coma) recommended a model diet for the UK, including a reduction to 6g of salt a day. The food industry obtained a leaked draft and four heavyweight food manufacturers, Cadbury Schweppes, Tate and Lyle, United Biscuits and Mars demanded a meeting with the department of health. They did not get the reassurance they wanted. That same year, United Biscuits and Tate and Lyle cut their contributions to the Tory party. </p> <p>MacGregor is convinced that this contributed to the government's rejection of the recommended salt level which has now been espoused by the FSA. \"That really infuriated us - that for a few thousand pounds, the health policy of the UK could be altered,\" he says. </p> <p>Cash was formed in 1996 to press the case through the media instead of polite government channels. It has worked better than they imagined. \"If you had said to me in 1996 that in 2004 the FSA would launch a \u00a34m campaign about the dangers of salt, I'd have said you were joking,\" says MacGregor. It took almost 40 years to get serious action on smoking, he points out. </p> <p>As any school child knows, salt is scientifically known as sodium chloride. It's a simple combination of two elements, easily extracted from sea water. Salt's primitive appeal must have to do with its bodily familiarity - our tears are salty; our blood is salty. But the question is how much we need of it. Chimpanzees and orang-utans get their sodium from plants they eat, not the salt cellar, and they have perfect blood pressure of around 90 over 70. High blood pressure, increasingly common in the UK where it rises steadily with age, is responsible for half the heart attacks and strokes that kill people here - 120,000 out of 240,000 a year. </p> <p>MacGregor claims there is virtually no scientific dispute in the UK over the link between salt, high blood pressure and heart attacks. Excess salt, says MacGregor, leads to water retention. People who eat too much salt could have a litre and a half of extra fluid sloshing around in their veins, he says. That means there is more blood for the heart to pump, and the blood pressure goes up. </p> <p>The question of how much is too much, however, seems to vary from person to person. It's quite possible that some of us can eat salt without living dangerously. Five years ago a team from the University of Utah school of medicine (in Salt Lake City, of course) identified three variations in a bit of human machinery called the angiotensinogen gene. High levels of a hormone produced by this gene also correlated with high blood pressure. They reported in 1998 that variants in the gene made some people much more sensitive to salt. So for some, a low salt diet had a significant effect on blood pressure. </p> <p>There is more than one cause of high blood pressure. But most people in the field believe that maybe one third of all hypertension sufferers are reacting to the buildup of sodium. Yet some humans feel they need salt, and some feel the need for salty food at all times. Six years ago Ilene Bernstein, of the University of Washington, proposed that babies might arrive with a taste for salt implanted at birth. </p> <p>It depended, she and colleagues claimed, on just how nauseous and uncomfortable their mothers felt during early pregnancy. They reported in 1998 that adult children of mothers who had experienced morning sickness to conspicuous levels were also very keen on salty snack foods. Babies at 16 weeks old were more likely to show a fondness for salty water if they had previously sent their mothers-to-be retching to the bathroom. Her guess was that dehydration linked with vomiting might have something to do with a fondness for salt. </p> <p>\"Fluid depletion in the mother triggers the hormonal system in the blood and kidneys to restore the normal fluid level,\" said Bernstein. \"We don't know if these hormones cross the placental barrier and affect the baby or if dehydration causes the baby to release its own hormones to restore fluid balance. These hormones can have powerful effects on the brain.\" </p> <p>Such claims are contentious. But they do illustrate the complex link between salt and the functioning of the human machinery. Some babies show a distinct response to (very slightly) salty tastes within three days of birth, the response being strongest in those babies who have at least one grandparent with a history of hypertension, according to the journal Hypertension in 2002. A team from Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge Massachusetts tested 283 babies in their sucking response to the taste of salt and sugar. The 67 babies that seemed to like salt most already had, at three days, higher blood pressure levels than those who seemed to object to the taste. </p> <p>Such research seems to suggest that appetite, inheritance and environment all play a part in the link between salt and hypertension. But this is not saying very much: appetite, inheritance and environment play a role in practically everything. Nobody is yet prepared to suggest that a warm response to a hint of the flavour of salt is really an indicator of some future cardiovascular troubles to come. </p> <p>Salt manufacturers are unsurprisingly unhappy at the turn of events in the UK, in spite of the fact that most of what they produce ends up on the roads rather than in our baked beans. \"The biggest problem we have is that the deer on the roads lick up the salt - they like it just as we do,\" says Peter Sherratt, general secretary of the Salt Manufacturers' Association. </p> <p>While the food manufacturers agree to salt reductions here and there - although not as comprehensively as the FSA and Cash want - Sherratt insists much of the science is nonsense.\"A heck of a lot of literature says the government is wrong.\" </p> <p>He cites two documents that have come out within recent months. The national diet and nutrition survey commissioned by the government says salt has no effect on the blood pressure of healthy people, while the National Institute for Clinical Excellence says that people with high blood pressure should be on drugs to control it. \"I don't understand where salt comes into the equation,\" he says. \"There is no problem with a healthy person, and an unhealthy person should be on drugs.\" </p> <p>If some of us are more susceptible to salt-related damage than others, maybe there is an element of sense in that, but that's not how public health strategies work. We all have to eat less salt because we don't know who the lucky people are who can eat crisps with impunity. And if we won't even notice a small cut in our salt intake, then it's hard to see the problem for anybody except a salt manufacturer - or a processed food company that has to have another think about how to make its pizzas taste good.</p>",
  "<p>When Marina de Van was eight, a car knocked her down and broke her leg. \"The strange thing was I didn't do any of the things that you might expect,\" she says as she reclines, gap-toothed and surly, like a boiled-down Beatrice Dalle, on an armchair in a Paris hotel. \"I didn't faint and I didn't really feel pain. Instead, I saw my leg as if it wasn't part of my body, as if it was an object. For me, then, it was a fascinating deformed object.\"</p> <p>When her mother showed her X-rays of her leg, she pointed out that part of the bone was missing and had been thrown away after an operation. \"That really intensified my feeling of estrangement from my leg. It wasn't mine but I was obsessed with looking at it.\"</p> <p>When she returned to school, De Van and her friends used to play a game of jabbing needles into scars from the accident that had become insensitive. \"I was at one and the same time proud of myself for being insensitive to the pain and terrified really that my body had become devoid of feeling.\" She says that throughout her adolescence she was intrigued by her own body in a way that her friends were not. She says she was a strangely Cartesian adolescent convinced that her self and her body were not one, but that her body had a life of its own.</p> <p>\"As I grew up, I began to think that in our society we are utterly alienated from our bodies. Think of the work we do in offices - it's as though our bodies could have their own lives and we wouldn't necessarily know about it. There is a split, and sometimes our bodies are utterly absent from us.</p> <p>\"I became more and more struck by this during my early adulthood, how alienated we are from our bodies. I was also struck by how little it takes for our bodies, or parts of our bodies, to suddenly become alien objects, but ones which fascinate us. All you have to do is see your leg at an unusual, unfeasible angle, for example, for it to become a strange spectacle that's like looking at an object that in some ways has nothing to do with you. Of course, in another way it does have something to do with you and you know it does.\"</p> <p>Twenty three years after the accident, De Van, now 31, returned to that battleground for her extraordinary debut feature, Dans Ma Peau (In My Skin), which she wrote, directed and in which she stars. It's an extremely difficult film to watch, about a young French woman called Esther (played by De Van) who becomes obsessed with self-mutilation and, later, self-cannibalism. It's been described as a slasher film with a twist - one in which the victim and the perpetrator are one. Like David Cronenberg's film adaptation of JG Ballard's Crash or Georges Franju's Eyes without a Face, it's a skin flick that purports to have something interesting to say about our attitudes to our bodies.</p> <p>The film starts at a party where De Van's character, Esther, inadvertently cuts her leg on a piece of metal in the garden. It is, as one critic noted, the equivalent of the vampire's kiss. The wound seduces Esther from her bourgeois life of boyfriend, apartment-hunting and corporeally disengaged market research job, into an autoerotic, sensual world of biting and self-harm. Unaware of how badly injured she is, Esther returns to chatting with her friends at the party. As viewers, what we are made aware of immediately is how growingly alienated from her friends and the other party guests she is. We are also amazed that this horrible wound isn't causing her pain or making her seek help. \"Now you understand how odd it was for me when I was an eight-year-old girl when I was wounded, feeling nothing!\" says De Van, breaking into laughter for the first and only time during the interview.</p> <p>Later in the film, Esther sees how badly she has been hurt and visits hospital for treatment. The doctor, played by De Van's brother Adrien, is appalled that she has taken so long to seek treatment for such a massive gash. \"Are you sure this is your leg?\" he asks, a question that stresses Esther's dislocation from a body she regards as an object she only happens to inhabit. She refuses surgery to replace the tissue on her leg. Instead, and this is where the film becomes something you might watch (if at all) through your fingers, Esther becomes obsessed with opening her wounds. One day she hides in her office basement where she extends her wounds, cutting them with a piece of metal.</p> <p>Was it difficult to play scenes like this? She performs a French shrug-pout, gives a thousand-mile stare out of the window and, finally, the answer. \"Not really. What was necessary was for me to lose myself in the activity, to lose myself in this infantile sensual world. I have had experience of acting before of course [she played a satisfyingly sinister backpacker in Francois Ozon's 1997 movie Regarder La Mer (See the Sea)], but never of acting scenes like this. I had a coach on set to work with me on the acting, and also to direct scenes in which I was too involved with what I was doing to direct.\"</p> <p>In the flesh, Marina De Van is as blankly feral as her character in the film, though you would look in vain for wounds to her arms. If you ask her \"Are you all right?\" she will reply \"I know why you're asking that. Yes, there's nothing wrong with me. You're thinking about the character in the film, not me. Esther eats herself, not me.\" De Van has been seen as both scary and regal - the genetic splicing of PJ Harvey and Audrey Hepburn, but this impeccably middle class film-maker (mother a lawyer, father a musicologist), who co-wrote two irredeemably pleasant Francois Ozon films, Under the Sand and Eight Women, is hardly regal. You can imagine her snarling along to PJ Harvey's Rid of Me in self-absorbed splendour, but hardly playing twee call girl Holly Golightly. </p> <p>Why did she decide to play Esther? \"Because the film is about my obsession with my body. I had a great desire to explore it by putting it on film.\" So doesn't the film risk making you as obsessive and autoerotic as the character you play? \"Would that be a bad thing?\" she retorts. \"Maybe you have the problem? Perhaps you are stuck in bourgeois conventions, and I am more liberated?\" The other possibility is that you're a self-absorbed woman who's made a sickening film, teeming with self-regard masquerading as existential self-exploration. \"Do you really believe that?\" she asks. It's a possibility, I suggest. De Van looks out of the window.</p> <p>In any event, during the film Esther becomes increasingly obsessed with self-harm. Although most of Dans Ma Peau is filmed in a cool, naturalistic style, there is a bravura surreal scene in which she goes to a business meeting at a restaurant. As her tedious clients exchange banal thoughts on European capitals they have visited, Esther drinks glass after glass of wine and anxiously notices that her forearm has become a prosthetic limb which she cannot control. It creeps across her plate and then becomes detached from her body. Esther screws it back on and then, under the table, stabs the limb repeatedly with a steak knife. </p> <p>\"In the restaurant scene, Esther's body has become something to play with and eat,\" says De Van. \"It's a regression: what she is doing is childish and pre-sexual.\" Immediately after this scene, Esther hurriedly checks into a hotel across the street, as if with a lover, and proceeds to gorge herself on her arm in a darkened corner. Blood spurts from her lacerations as she bites, spraying her agonised face. In later scenes, she carves herself with blades and razors and peels off pieces of skin. She doesn't need anyone else to give her sensual pleasure. Naturally, of course, those around her - a work friend and her fiance - become increasingly worried. As he realises what Esther is doing, her fiance (played by Laurent Lucas, from Harry, He's Here to Help) becomes angry and then incredulous. He wonders if self-esteem issues are the key to Esther's problem, and asks her \"Don't you like your body?\" - a line that makes him, and any psychological explanation for what she is up to, seem facile. In fact, she likes her body a lot - a little too much for most people's tastes.</p> <p>Dennis Lim in the Village Voice described the film as \"a love story between a woman and her own body that concludes with the relationship fully consummated\". But it is hardly a consummation devoutly to be wished for by viewers. Rather, it is one that leaves us seeking an explanation, for a soothing account of Esther's seeming pathology. The Chicago Tribune critic Robert K Elder, for instance, wrote that \"De Van simply and seductively bares the practices and consequences of self-cutting. But since she's so focused on the act itself, De Van could easily be branded a blood pornographer for failing to explore the roots of Esther's behaviour. Imagine someone making a film about bulimia but only showing its characters as they purge - and eroticising that activity - without any explanation of its cause.\"</p> <p>It's an understandable objection, but one that misses the point. The film is not a sociological treatise about cutting, and De Van rebels against the notion that all apparently dysfunctional behaviours need have an explanation of that kind. That is a problematic rebellion, though, because the phenomenon of self-cutting has been subjected to so much media attention that one might come to the film hoping for a sympathetic account of why it happens. But this picture does not offer one. It is thus a film that is every bit as truculent and frustrating as De Van is as an interviewee. Dans Ma Peau explores an existential rather than a sociological phenomenon and that's what undercuts some of the more high-minded objections to it. Esther, at the end, is at home in her relationship: she is, after the alienation of her bourgeois life, finally in her own skin (and, thanks to the self-cannibalism, it is also in her). \"I don't really have all that much to say about the problem of women cutting themselves. That may be a surprise for some people, but it is the truth,\" says De Van.</p> <p>That said, Marina De Van does want to have her film both ways - both as a story that comments on our society's alienation from our bodies and one that refuses offer sociological explanation. At one point in the interview she says: \"I wanted everybody to relate to the story.\" At another, she insists that what Esther does is incomprehensible: \"She lives in an experience she cannot transmit or share.\" But if that is the case, Dans Ma Peau puts its viewers in an invidious position, unjustifiably watching a woman inexplicably eating herself. Bon appetit!</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dans Ma Peau opens in the UK on September 17</p>",
  "<p>From the moment they stroll on stage and singer Paul Banks pulls off his dark glasses to survey the sold-out crowd, Interpol radiate self-possession. In a lot of bands this cool detachment, this rigorous sense of poise and purpose, would be alienating. Not here. Instead what you sense is the electrifying confidence of a band who believe absolutely in the power of their own songs.</p> <p>Their set is short, just 12 tracks (taken almost equally from the band's 2002 debut, Turn on the Bright Lights, and this month's follow-up, Antics), torn through in less than an hour. But in its concentration it's immeasurably thrilling. As musicians, the quartet and their shadowy additional keyboardist are meticulous, zealously reproducing every raddled, rattling drumline, thundering bass note and lashing riff. Such is their control, each song sounds exactly as it does on record - only louder, harder, taut with emotion, exploding with energy. When they pause in the middle of PDA, the tension is palpable, almost unbearably so.</p> <p>Precision defines Interpol, from the architectural sweep of Carlos D's fringe to Banks and Kessler's matching tie pins. They are the kind of band who make you care what shoes they're wearing, so impeccable do they look. It's a mystery how Carlos D maintains his composure bent double over his bass, how Kessler can play the entire gig shuffling seductively about the stage without removing his suit jacket. Only Banks grows dishevelled, his wispy hair matted with sweat, making him look older and oddly careworn.</p> <p>Yet there is much more to the band than surface style. When Banks sings, in Stella Was a Diver, of a girl's conviction that building fronts conceal staring faces, he plunges you into a world of despair; the lyrics to Evil, meanwhile, sear with their suggestion of a relationship unhinged. Banks rakes over the embers of love fearlessly, celebrates romance without being trite. And as he does so, his voice sounds faultless. Like everything else about this band.</p>",
  "Iraqi national guardsmen today found the decapitated bodies of three people, believed to be foreigners, dumped in nylon sacks north of Baghdad. <p>The Reuters news agency reported that Iraqi police had initially said the three had tattoos that appeared to be written in Arabic and Turkish. However, they later said two of the bodies had tattoos written in the Roman alphabet, one saying HECER and the other a letter H. </p> <p>The third body had tattoos written in Arabic script, but the words were not Arabic. The US military said initial reports indicated that the men were Arabs. </p> <p>Reports said the national guardsmen found the corpses on a roadside near the town of Dujail, 38 miles north of Baghdad, this morning. Their heads were strapped to the backs of their bodies.</p> <p>Many foreign truck drivers from neighbouring countries, such as Turkey and Jordan, have been seized by militants in Iraq. </p> <p>Insurgents are also holding two French journalists, Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, and two female Italian aid workers, Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, hostage. </p> <p>A Jordanian transport company today agreed to stop all work in Iraq in order to secure the release of one of its drivers, Khalifa al-Breizat. </p> <p>Another militant group today said in a videotape that it had released a Turkish man, Aytulla Gezmen, who worked as an Arabic language translator. There was no immediate evidence that either Mr Breizat or Mr Gezmen had been freed.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Iraq, violent clashes between insurgents and US and Iraqi forces continued, a day after a car bomb attack on a Baghdad police station left 47 people dead and 114 injured. </p> <p>A car bomb exploded in a town south of Baghdad, killing two people and injuring 10, Colonel Adnan Abdul-Rahman, an interior ministry official, said. The bombers had targeted a national guard checkpoint in Suwayrah, around 40 miles south of the capital, he added. </p> <p>Fighting in the province of al-Anbar killed 10 Iraqis and wounded six, health ministry officials said. Al-Anbar includes the cities of Falluja and Ramadi, which are under insurgent control.</p>",
  "<p> As I was on my way to Austin I took the time to read gamespot's excellent <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/features/6106009/index.html\">article</a> about the relationship between academia and games. It's a topical topic, with the new crop of students heading for the halls of learning and labour. Indeed, if you want something to inspire you back into further education, check out Dr. Edward Castronova's <a href=\"http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/08/virtual_worlds_.html\">proposed seminar schedule</a> for the Topical Seminar in Media and Society: Virtual Worlds at the University of Indiana. I particularly like the reading list.</p> <p>Man, why didn't they offer this at my school?</p> <p>In honour of the beginning of the school year, gamesblog grabbed <a href=\"http://www.watercoolergames.org/about.shtml#frasca\">Gonzalo Frasca</a>, one of the leaders of the game studies community, at the recent <a href=\"http://www.gdc-europe.co.uk/conf_sessions.asp#5\">Academic Day</a> at London's <a href=\"http://www.gdc-europe.co.uk\">Game Developer's Conference-Europe</a>. He is based at the <a href=\"http://www.itu.dk/Internet/sw5211.asp\">IT University of Copenhagen</a> and also co-runs the political games development company <a href=\"http://www.powerfulrobot.com\">Powerful Robot Games</a>. He and <a href=\"http://www.watercoolergames.org/about.shtml#bogost\">Dr. Ian Bogost</a> were commissioned last year to make the first political party-funded game, <a href=\"http://www.deanforamericagame.com/\">Dean for Iowa</a>. Some of their titles are pretty effective; check out <a href=\"http://www.newsgaming.com/games/index12.htm\">September 12th</a> for a good example of how games can inspire deep thinking and moral thought. (requires Shockwave)</p> <p>Frasca also runs <a href=\"http://ludology.org\">Ludology.org</a>, a blog of resources for the games studies community.</p> <p><strong>How much has your academic background influenced the games that you design?</strong> Totally. My thesis was on political videogames, and two years later I was making a political video game for the American election. I think I would have made quite a different game if I hadn't spent two years thinking about it and the issues involved. I'm not saying it would have been better or worse, but this project even caught me off guard. I think my academic background gave me confidence and energy to go and talk to politicians about making a game.</p> <p><strong>What is it about the current cultural and social climate that allows people to get Games Studies PhDs?</strong> Well, there's money in videogames firstly, and at the end of the day that appeals. People who grew up with games are now getting older. They know games aren't going to drive them nuts or make them kill their friends or anything. People have been moved by games, they have made friends because of games, so goodbye bias!</p> <p><strong>How do people who consider games to be \"just for kids\" respond to you as a grown man who studies them?</strong> In general, I don't know. I've been able to make a living making games in a very poor country so I guess I got some respect out of that. I'm not that stupid after all. Personally I haven't felt much rejection over the past couple of years. Before that I was kind of ashamed to say I studied videogames. Now I don't have a problem at all.</p> <p>People who are not familiar with games have a bias. Many games are crappy. There's a lot of reasons to hate many games, but there are also many great games.</p> <p><strong>What kinds of things do people study?</strong> The breadth is enormous. They study all kinds of things: politics, social issues, psychological issues, aesthetics \u2013 what does it mean to have beautiful gameplay, or more abstract ideas \u2013 and of course that's from the non-game development side of things. On that end you have engineering, physics, 3D modelling. People also study them within the context of health issues and how games modify your body. I'm really worried that this may give a Microsoft executive who has no idea what makes a good game tools for refusing a game because it doesn't generate enough saliva. That's the kind of things they find. Thankfully, I haven't had to deal with business people like that yet.</p> <p><strong>Games studies conferences are the only interactive entertainment-related conferences where there's a queue for the ladies' loo. Would you say that proportionately more women study games, and is this representative of the research community?</strong> My supervisor was <a href=\"http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/~murray/\">Janet Murray</a>, and she's one of the best known people in the field. In our centre we just hired a new PhD woman yesterday. I'm not sure if we're 50/50, but if we're not we're 60/40.</p> <p>There're plenty of women I know who do great research. It might be a great thing to have an academic field starting from scratch now so at least you don't have to drag in the politics from before.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think industry can learn from academia and vice versa?</strong> There's this fear from industry towards academia and this arrogance from academia towards industry, but it's technically it's changing. To the people in the industry who have strong feel against academia, I say there's nothing wrong with Homer or Shakespeare, but these people have been dead forever so wouldn't you rather, if you had to go to school again, study Zelda at school? It's the academics who are going to make this possible. If you want your kids to go to school and learn about Miyamoto and Will Wright that's how it works. It can't be bad.</p> <p>On the other hand, the academics have no idea how hard and how complicated it is to make and ship a product. And as the industry grows older, designers may enjoy doing some part time teaching. In that way, it's a collaboration.</p>",

  "The Israeli government does not intend to honour the US-backed road map to peace in the Middle East once it has completed a planned pullout from Gaza, an Israeli newspaper reported today. <p>Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, told the Yediot Ahronot daily that there might not be any troop pullbacks after Israel had carried out its so-called unilateral \"disengagement\" from the Palestinians - withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and four small West Bank settlements - in 2005. </p> <p>\"It is very possible that, after the evacuation, there will be a long period when nothing else happens,\" Mr Sharon said. He told the paper it was impossible to say whether this could signal decades of stalemate. </p> <p>Mr Sharon said that, as long as there was no significant shift in the Palestinian leadership and policy, Israel would \"continue its war on terrorism, and will stay in the territories [of the West Bank] that will remain after the implementation of disengagement\". </p> <p>The road map to peace was launched last year, envisaging a Palestinian state by 2005. The plan did not specify the borders of that state, but senior US officials said Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza had to come to an end. </p> <p>The US president, George Bush, has since said it would be \"unrealistic\" to expect Israel to remove large West Bank settlements - a statement interpreted by Mr Sharon as backing for his plan to keep large settlement blocs in any future deal with the Palestinians. </p> <p>In the Yediot interview, Mr Sharon was asked how his disengagement plan differed from a proposal by the former Israeli opposition leader Amram Mitzna. Mr Mitzna last year said Israel should restart peace talks with the Palestinians by withdrawing from the Gaza Strip, including the isolated settlement of Netzarim. </p> <p>\"Mitzna suggested something different, to start the Netzarim evacuation and to continue dismantling settlements, based on the road map,\" Mr Sharon said. \"This would have brought Israel to a most difficult situation. I didn't agree to this. Today, we are also not following the road map. I am not ready for this.\" </p> <p>Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian cabinet minister, said Mr Sharon's comments had confirmed Palestinian fears that the disengagement plan was a ploy to cement Israel's control over large areas of the West Bank. </p> <p>US and EU officials have assured the Palestinians they only back the disengagement plan as part of the road map. </p> <p>\"I think that those who saw the Gaza disengagement as an opportunity, because they counted that it would be part of the road map, should really understand that their good intentions are one thing and that Sharon's good intentions are another,\" Mr Erekat told the Associated Press. </p> <p>\"Sharon's intention is to destroy the road map and to dictate his long-term interim solution of Gaza as a prison and 40% of the West Bank within walls.\"</p> <p>He today urged US and EU leaders to take action against Israel's continued building in the West Bank, arguing that years of US and European condemnation of illegal Isreali settlements had resulted only in more being built. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Israeli soldiers today killed five Palestinian fugitives, including a militant leader, during a fierce gunbattle in the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian and Israeli sources said. </p> <p>The army surrounded a building in which wanted militants were holed up and a battle erupted, Palestinian witnesses said. Palestinian security officials said five militants from the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades were killed, and a sixth man injured. </p> <p>The dead included Nader Aswad, a local leader who was on Israel's most-wanted list. Al-Aqsa is loosely linked to the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement. Military sources said five wanted Palestinians had been killed, but gave no further details.</p>",

  "<p>Dear Malcolm</p> <p>Tell me, how did Society Guardian (then called Society Tomorrow) come about? And did anyone think in 1979 it would become such a huge editorial and commercial success?</p> <p>Secondly, I was fascinated by your first piece for Society Tomorrow <a href=\"http://society.theguardian.com/25years/story/0,15045,1304367,00.html\">Who's afraid of Mrs T?</a>. It correctly predicts the dramatic impact that the proposed public spending cuts outlined by Mrs Thatcher (then just three months into her first term of office) would have on the welfare state. But it also assumes that some Conservative ministers would come to their senses and fight a rearguard action. They didn't, on the whole. Looking back, do you think anyone had quite realised at that point the sheer revolutionary scale of Thatcherism, and its break with one-nation Toryism?<br>Yours Patrick</p> <p>Dear Patrick</p> <p>In 1978 I was seconded by the Guardian to be special adviser to the secretary of state for health, social security and social services but returned to the paper when Labour lost the election in May, 1979. At that point we only published one specialist section, Education Guardian, which came out every Tuesday. It seemed to me that the other social services - health, housing, social security, social care, and planning, along with probation, prisons and the police - which I covered as the paper's social affairs leader writer - deserved a section of their own. It would allow us to look in much greater depth at issues which the main paper, then much smaller, could accommodate. Moreover, having just worked at the centre of government, it seemed to me there was a new role for newspapers looking at how the perceptions at the centre, looked to people on the ground. Peter Preston, the Guardian editor at the time, had been thinking of just such a section even before I came back to the paper from Whitehall, but there were expenditure implications when we were much less prosperous.</p> <p>Caroline Marland, who joined the group as a telephone sales manager in 1976 when we only had 8% of a tiny recruitment market, became a close ally. It was she who was convinced the section could become another powerful source of revenue. We met up in various wine bars and lobbied our respective bosses. It was agreed we could have a trial run, so I wrote three successive articles run over three weeks on juvenile crime and ways of dealing with it. The go-ahead was given. It began as half a page at the back of the main paper with just a page and a half of adverts. Caroline went on to become advertising manager, and then managing director of the Guardian before she retired. I have remained the Guardian's social affairs leader writer, which as my children note, \"is not much of a CV, Dad\". I disagree with them. I can't think of a more satisfying or rewarding job.</p> <p>I don't think even Caroline ever envisaged we would grow so large or so dominant in the sector. </p> <p>In reply to question two, I would like to make two points: at no point during the 1979 election did Mrs Thatcher ever indicate that she intended to cut back social security or squeeze social services. But it was widely assumed by Whitehall's insiders she would cut social security benefits, but she managed to duck out of all questions on this issue in the campaign. True to these suspicions, the first sentence in her first white paper (as I set out in my column this week) declared: \"Public expenditure is at the heart of Britain's present economic difficulties.\" She proceeded to end the basic state pension's earnings index, which 25 years on is why the single person's pension is worth \u00a330 a week less than it would have been and a couple's basic pension \u00a350 less. Politically, she could never have admitted this in the election campaign.There were all manner of other squeezes, through eligibility tests and time limits on other benefits too.</p> <p>Second, remember when Mrs T was first elected she was not nearly as powerful as she later became. Her only cabinet experience had been as education secretary, a more lowly position then than it is now. Her cabinet contained many one nation Tories (Willie Whitelaw at the Home Office who was also deputy PM, Jim Prior at employment, Mark Carlisle at education, Lord Carrington in the Foreign Office). All were powerful figures known as \"the Wets\". The hope was that they would rally and take her on. Alas they didn't. She had an incredibly powerful personality, but no one in 1979 thought she would become the dominant figure she became. </p> <p>Brian Lapping and Norma Percy at Granada Television had the splendid idea of making a documentary in which journalists played the ministers in the battle to protect the welfare state. We all used our separate contacts to help fill in the picture. I played Patrick Jenkin (social services secretary) where my old contacts gave me plenty of ammunition on his refusal to resist the cuts. He was furious and was still complaining about the programme and my columns with information from the inside, years later. Sarah Hogg, then at the Economist, played Margaret Thatcher, a perfect piece of casting. She was just naturally as bossy as Thatcher.<br>Yours Malcolm</p> <p>Dear Malcolm</p> <p>Society Guardian has constantly higlighted innovation in public and voluntary services. It is claimed that ideas as varied as baby bonds and social entreprenuership were floated within its pages. Can you tell us more about this?<br>Yours Patrick</p> <p>Dear Patrick</p> <p>Some of the most satisfying features we ran were proposals from social entrepreneurs that turned into real projects. </p> <p>Michael Young, the greatest social entrepreneur of the last century, [see below] launched a dozen different projects on our pages, which included:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The College of Health to represent patient interests. It drew up the first guide to hospital waiting lists and created a telephone helpline, which worried patients could call, and be put through to tapes compiled by specialists on 500 different diseases. It went on to develop new ways that the patient's voice could be heard by NHS planners and explored ways in which patients could be given better information on complementary medicine.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Language Line, which provides interpreters in more than 100 languages for public service users and service providers, such as GPs, hospital doctors, social workers or police officers trying to help people who cannot speak English.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The School for Social Entrepreneurs, initially based in London but now with four regional branches, where people with an interesting idea for a new charity or not-for-profit enterprise come together with up to a dozen others to spend a year learning about raising funds, marketing, charity law, handling the media, running a small organisation and so on...</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A national college for funeral directors to raise their standard</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A baby naming society for non religious parents, where various different forms of ceremony to celebrate the birth of a child and strengthen family bonds can be made.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Baby bonds, which were eventually taken up by the chancellor, to ensure even children in poor families are able to claim a modest capital sum at the age of 18.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The first summer school in a deprived area, where children were offered sports opportunities and help with literacy and numeracy if they wanted it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A bid to help turn Robben Island in South Africa into an open university for the hundreds of thousands of young people who boycotted schools in opposition to the apartheid regime. This was one of the few that did not take off, even though Nelson Mandela was particularly interested in the idea.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> And a grandparents association that could lobby on behalf of grandparents. <br>Yours Malcolm</p> <p>Dear Macolm</p> <p>Which social reformers - politicians, activists, academics and policy makers - have you most admired over the past 25 years? And who the least? Who have been the most influential? <br>Yours Patrick</p> <p>Dear Patrick</p> <p>One of the great privileges of my Guardian job has been the wide variety of social reformers I have been able to meet - pressure group leaders, social entrepreneurs, ministers, academics, MPs, researchers for foundations, trusts and thinktanks.</p> <p>At the end of the 1960s there was the excitement of new pressure groups taking off and attracting large numbers of young supporters, such as Shelter (under Des Wilson) and the Child Poverty Action Group (under Frank Field). The Fabian Society conducted excellent audits on both the 1964-69 and the 1974-79 Labour governments, which still offer useful lessons for the current government.</p> <p>The London School of Economics has produced a host of impressive social reformers, who have written for Society, among them David Piachaud (who was the first to spot the \"poverty trap\" while a Downing Street adviser), Howard Glennerster (author of 15 books on social policy and a former Labour Party researcher), John Hills (a leading monitor of poverty and social exclusion) and his partner Ann Power (an expert on housing).</p> <p>Then there are the trusts, such as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, that produce massive amounts of research on key social issues, including poverty, housing and the family, that often first featured on our pages.</p> <p>The number of thinktanks have continued to mushroom. Victor Rothschild, who set up the first government think tank, always had an ear for a good phrase and organised the first (and only) press briefing (on his gambling report) where I have been offered champagne.</p> <p>But the social reformer who stands above all others in my estimation was Michael Young, the greatest social entrepreneur of the last century. He just buzzed with ideas and was always such fun to be with. As the Labour party's research director at the end of the war he wrote its famous 1945 manifesto. He tried to persuade the Attlee government to leave a chair empty at the cabinet table to represent the voter but failed in this bid. But by the end of his life he had invented over 50 organisations, among them the Open University, the Consumer Association, and the Institute for Community Studies. [See above].<br>Yours Malcolm</p>",
  "A rejuvenated Royal Shakespeare Company yesterday announced plans for a celebration of the gunpowder plot, a feast of new writing, and a slightly-Shakespeare play next year followed by an ambitious season in 2006 of every word written by the Bard. <p>Artistic director Michael Boyd was visibly jubilant at the company's most successful Stratford season in 10 years, the slashing of the crippling deficit he inherited - and above all confounding the advisers who warned him Middle England would stay away from his current season of 17th century Spanish plays: \"I'm glad my optimism about human nature has been rewarded.\"</p> <p>The complete Shakespeare season in 2006 will be one of the company's most ambitious projects ever. It will involve dozens of visiting companies and many other venues in Stratford, and will be the first attempt anywhere to present Shakespeare's entire canon in one season, including all the plays, the sonnets and other poems - and the apocrypha, the many works claimed for him.</p> <p>Before that, next year's season will have an overtly political slant, with old and new plays dealing with explicitly political issues, including war, terrorism, race, censorship - and gunpowder.</p> <p>The company will \"celebrate\" - its choice of word - the 400th anniversary of Guy Fawkes and all that, with a Swan Theatre season called Gunpowder. It will not take the traditional bonfire night line on treason and plot.</p> <p>Mr Boyd said of himself, and his Roman Catholic deputy Greg Doran: \"As a Northern Irish man, and Greg as a slave of Rome, we do have a different perspective on Englishness, we just do.\"</p> <p>The Gunpowder season will include a new commission by the Irish playwright Frank McGuinness, and four Elizabethan plays which were dynamite in their day.</p> <p>Thomas More, by Shakespeare and up to four other authors, opens with a race riot in London provoked by asylum seekers to Britain fleeing religious persecution on the continent.</p> <p>The play was seen as a weapon of mass destruction and was banned in Shakespeare's lifetime: the manuscript in the British Library still has the censor's scrawl in the margin \"perform this scene at your peril\".</p> <p>It will be twinned with Sejanus, a political thriller set in ancient Rome which almost had Ben Jonson jailed for treason, and has probably not been performed in 400 years.</p> <p>The plays completing the season are equally seditious: A New Way to Please You, or The Old Law, by Middleton, Rowley and Massinger, is a black comedy on euthanasia - the old law requires the killing of useless old people; Believe What You Will, by Massinger, deals with a Middle Eastern leader hounded by a Roman Empire threatening sanctions against any state sheltering the terrorist.</p> <p>The main house will tackle the comedies, after this year's tragedies - which met a patchy critical response but have been a commercial success, with box office averaging 75%.</p> <p>Yesterday's announcements marked Mr Boyd's first full season as artistic director.</p> <p>He inherited a company seen as a basket case, with disastrous finances and worse morale. The deficit has now been reduced from \u00a32.8m to \u00a3500,000, which he cheerfully described as \"the sort of deficit that you play around with as opposed to treat respectfully\".</p> <p>Next week should also see a climax, if not a finale, to the company's own long running drama, which has had as much pity and terror, sensation and plot twists as anything on the stage. The board is due to consider the redevelopment plans for the company's Stratford-upon-Avon home, a listed building on the most prominent riverside site in the town. Although generations of actors have great affection for the building, it is a sweat box in summer where people regularly faint in the cheapest gallery seats.</p> <p>The subject has been contentious, since the previous artistic director pulled the company out of its London base at the Barbican while simultaneously expressing a preference for razing the Stratford theatre.</p> <p>The board is likely to decide on gradual redevelopment, with performances continuing at two out of the three Stratford venues at all times, rather than a scorched earth approach.</p>",
  "<p>As Opec begins its much heralded meeting in Vienna today, one thing is abundantly clear. No one has a clue about the likely course of oil prices for the next 12 months. But many observers are deeply worried. </p> <p>The price rose to great heights last month, almost touching $50 (\u00a327.70) a barrel, and has been hovering around $40 in recent days, with almost any potentially scary factor driving it higher, such as - until it veered away - the prospect of Hurricane Ivan hitting production in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>Those of us who have been in the macroeconomic observatory for longer than we care to remember were brought up in a world where cheap energy was taken for granted. The use of the \"oil weapon\" by the (mainly) Middle Eastern producers changed all that during the two famous oil shocks of 1973-74 and 1979-1980. </p> <p>The price of oil became such an important factor in the macroeconomic equation that some economists, such as Professor Andrew Oswald of Warwick University, have made quite a name for themselves highlighting the close connection between macroeconomic developments - not least recession - and the price of that one vitally important commodity. </p> <p>The days have gone when Opec - the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries - used the price of oil as a weapon. Its members have long since reached an agreement with the industrialised west (now joined in its voracious thirst for oil by China) that both oil producers and consumers have to live together in the world economy, and a certain measure of stability suits both. </p> <p>Thus, this week, Ali al-Naimi, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, said: \"We are producing 2m b/d [barrels a day] over the ceiling. Saudi Arabia is producing 9.5m b/d and the reason we are doing it is to bring the price down.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, the fact that he praises Opec (of which Saudi Arabia is the key member - the \"swing producer\") for having lessened the \"upward pressure on price\" and moved it \"from close to $50 back to $40\", says something about his measure of success. </p> <p>Such prices are a significant level above the $22 to $28 a barrel target range which operated earlier in this young millennium, and well above the $20 a barrel which certain optimists thought would prevail in the event of a happy outcome to the invasion of Iraq. </p> <p>Yes, there were such optimists, although it is difficult to believe. And most of them were at the top of the US administration. </p> <p>But we are where we are. The combination of a not very impressive world economic recovery and the rapid industrialisation of China, has maintained strong demand for oil, against the background of a world oil production system running at virtually full capacity, give or take the odd supply bottleneck (for different reasons) in Venezuela and Iraq.</p> <p>The sluggishness - indeed decline - in the real price of oil since the mid-1980s (when it was roughly the equivalent of a present day $80) has discouraged serious searches for new oil fields, as well as the development of known potential sources. And one must never forget that the fear of political instability in Saudi Arabia was a major motive behind the decision to invade Iraq. </p> <p>On any serious reading, the prospects for oil prices are finely balanced. It was interesting that Gordon Brown, who is not only Britain's chancellor but also chairman of the International Monetary Fund's key political committee, sounded a worried note in an article in the Financial Times last Friday, whereas Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank and the group of 10 leading central bankers, sounded desperate to be more positive earlier this week. </p> <p>From the UK's point of view, the good news for the chancellor is that a higher oil price means greater revenues for the Treasury. But this is a temporary benefit. Recent statistics indicate that Britain's days as a net oil exporter are coming to an end. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> William Keegan is the Observer's senior economics commentator</p>",
  "<p>Age discrimination at work is an \"ongoing and significant problem\" which could be costing the UK economy billions of pounds a year, according to a report published today. </p> <p>National Audit Office (NAO) research found employment rates among the over-50s were more than 5% lower than the average, and estimated the disparity was costing the economy \u00a319 to \u00a331bn each year in lost output, reduced taxes and increased welfare payments. </p> <p>Up to 1 million of the 2.7 million older people who were not working want to find jobs, but they face a set of barriers, including age discrimination by employers, health problems, low confidence and out-of-date skills, said the report. </p> <p>The government has promised to outlaw age discrimination at work by the end of 2006. But draft regulations originally due for publication in spring this year have been delayed. </p> <p>However, the NAO said it understood ministers remained \"fully committed\" to the legislation. Almost 70% of people between the age of 50 and retirement were in work last year, but this was \"significantly\" below the overall employment rate of more than 75% among working-age people, said the report. Almost half of jobless over-50s were receiving incapacity benefits, many on a long-term basis. </p> <p>The NAO called on the government to do more to help older workers find jobs. With an ageing population, Britain will increasingly depend on older employees for its economic vitality, it warned. </p> <p>The report, entitled Welfare to Work - Tackling the Barriers to the Employment of Older People, comes amid a lively debate about whether the retirement age will have to be put back in order to fend off a looming pensions crisis and avoid skills shortages. The work and pensions secretary, Alan Johnson, yesterday told the TUC that the government was not planning a new retirement age of 70. </p> <p>Launching today's document, the auditor general, Sir John Bourn said the employment gap affecting older workers had been narrowed by 1% last year, but more needed to be done. </p> <p>\"Good progress has been made in increasing the employment rate for older people,\" he said. \"As people are living longer, it is important they have better opportunities to continue working for longer, should they wish to do so, than has been the case in the past. </p> <p>\"There is scope for government agencies to focus their efforts on improving the employability of older people and for targeting disadvantaged groups. Success will bring benefits not only for the individual, but also for business, the taxpayer and the economy at large.\" </p> <p>The NAO found that the government's New Deal 50 Plus scheme for older workers had helped 120,000 people into work at an estimated cost of \u00a3270m, although it added that some of them may have found jobs themselves. </p> <p>Other employment and training programmes had helped a further 70,000 over-50s to find work. </p> <p>There were substantial variations in rates of employment for older workers across the country, with particularly high levels of inactivity in the north-east and Wales. </p> <p>Help the Aged's social inclusion policy manager, David Sinclair, said: \"Age discrimination is still the major barrier in preventing people from enjoying extended working lives. </p> <p>\"Age discrimination in employment is bad for business, bad for the economy, and can result in older people living their later lives in poverty. </p> <p>\"The government must no longer delay issuing the draft regulations that will seek to bring age equality into the workplace by 2006.\"</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: Protesting 'stops Batman seeing baby', Morris laments soundbite politics, and Lib Dems launch 'mini-manifesto'.</p> <p><b>IRAQ CARNAGE GOES ON AS BLAST KILLS 47</b></p> <p>It is the most heartbreaking pile of shoes you will see for a long time - those belonging to the victims of a bomb which killed 47 people and injured 114 in Baghdad yesterday. The shoes are pictured in poignant close-up on the Guardian's front page: sandals, brogues, men's and women's, dusty and spattered with blood. They are pictured in context on the Herald Tribune's front page, with a woman holding her head in grief after identifying her son's shoes among them. </p> <p>The words are no less affecting. Luke Harding, writing in the Guardian, quotes a falafel seller who works next to the police station that had been the target of the attack. \"The bomb went off at 10am. A lot of people were queueing up to join the police,\" he said. \"I handed a customer a sandwich. Suddenly there was an explosion, and a piece of metal ripped off the top of his head.\" The Guardian's headline wonders whether the attack presages a \"descent into civil war\".</p> <p>The Times brings the story in on page 14, with no picture. Instead, it carried a graphic showing the many areas of Iraq in which US-led control is faltering, and the numbers of deaths and kidnappings, both military and civil, since \"major combat\" ended last May. If that seems a cold-blooded approach to a massacre, another piece corrects the balance: \"In these weeks of early autumn, the corpse trees of Iraq have been covered in glistening red fruit. Look upwards into the branches of the eucalyptus or date palms ... and gobbets of flesh or intestines hang from the branches.\"</p> <p>The Telegraph's leader says \"the desperate struggle to bring democracy to Iraq has faded in the British consciousness\" - perhaps because of disinterest from some national newspapers? \"Don't be fooled by the lack of headlines\", the paper admonishes - although readers of other papers won't be. To its credit, the piece then argues persuasively that plans put forward by Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, to exclude unsettled areas from January's election would disenfranchise precisely the groups who need to be integrated if peace is to be achieved.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1304852,00.html\">Iraq: a descent into civil war?</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/538878.html\">IHT: Scores die in Iraq in wave of attacks</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/09/15/dl1501.xml\">Telegraph: Iraq is out of sight but not out of mind</a></p> <p><b>BATMAN ON THE SHELF</b></p> <p>After that, the fallout from Sunday's Buckingham Palace ledge protest by a man dressed as Batman provides welcome light relief. The angle most likely to make you slap your forehead in despair comes from the Sun, which reports that the girlfriend of Batman (who is occasionally known as Jason Hatch) has left him - taking their seven-month-old daughter with her - because he was spending so much time campaigning for access rights to his children from previous relationships. </p> <p>\"He was seeing hardly anything of our daughter\", complains Gemma Polson, \"a bit rich when the point of his campaign was to allow dads to see more of their children.\" The Sun notes that Ms Polson had already left Mr Hatch before his most recent protest. The Guardian hints that a reconciliation is possible, in case you care.</p> <p>The Times says Prince Charles thinks the army should take over security at royal residences. There are royals in the army - can't they do it themselves?</p> <p>A Telegraph leader, on gleefully irreverent form, takes issue with Mr Hatch's choice of costume.

Ms Morris famously resigned as education secretary, saying she was \"not up to the job\". She is once again a minister - this time for the arts - but has announced that she will not stand next year. </p> <p>Ms Morris says her reasons have nothing to do with policy, but with political style, particularly language. The subtext teased out in the headline \"We both know Alastair would say 'Diddums'\" is that Ms Morris objects to the macho practices of British politics; she says she objects to politics which is \"too much about soundbites and headlines\". Parris astutely brings out other reasons for the departure: Ms Morris thinks \"choice\" is overplayed, and must be teamed with \"access\" and \"capacity\" in public services. He gives the impression of a committed woman, bursting with ideas about policy, who will be a loss to politics. </p> <p>In contrast, for all sorts of reasons, there's more than a whiff of spin to the Telegraph's lead story. Melvin Bragg - a close friend of the Blairs, we're told - has said the prime minister came close to resigning this summer because of \"pressing domestic reasons\". The paper says political commentators had attributed Mr Blair's \"wobble\" (and he denies thinking about quitting) to worries that he might have become a liability to the Labour party. Bragg's comments, of course, suggest Mr Blair is a caring man who, incidentally, is not ashamed of his political record.

  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson last night declared that Manchester United had \"no reason to panic\" after their wretched start to the season but nevertheless summoned his players to a meeting to prepare for tonight's match with the French champions Lyon. </p> <p>United's manager is understood to have made it clear, in typically forceful terms, that his squad should be robust enough to cope with injury problems. Several of his players were described as \"stony-faced\" when they left the 30-minute inquest. </p> <p>\"We get on with it, we don't panic,\" Ferguson said later. \"If it's affecting the supporters, fine. And if it's in the media, fine again. As long as it does not get to us.

  "<p>Banning smoking in public places could save more lives more quickly than the creation of a single new anti-cancer drug, campaigners said today. </p> <p>Britain's biggest fundraising charity, Cancer Research UK, has set out its top 10 priorities for the government to take action to tackle the disease. </p> <p>The charity's chief executive, Professor Alex Markham, argued that the single most important contribution to tackling cancer in the next decade was legislation to outlaw smoking in pubs, restaurants and other workplaces. </p> <p>The government is currently considering such a move but is thought unlikely to introduce a nationwide ban in the near future. </p> <p>Prof Markham said he believed a ban would not only protect those working in the hospitality industry but would also encourage people who smoke while out socialising to kick the habit.</p> <p>The charity also called for limits on the advertising of junk foods in efforts to make people eat more healthily and reduce their risk of cancer and other diseases. </p> <p>It pointed out that scientists have estimated that a smoking ban would lead to almost 5,000 lives being saved each year. Non-smokers who are exposed to smoke in the workplace are estimated to increase their risk of lung cancer by up to 19%. </p> <p>Prof Markham said smoking killed 114,000 people a year and the charity was committed to finding the best ways to treat the disease. But he said second-hand smoke remained a real concern. </p> <p>\"I believe a single piece of legislation would be the most effective thing we could do to save lives when you compare it with the time and money it takes to develop a first-class drug,\" said Prof Markham. </p> <p>\"In a recent poll of more than 4,000 people, four out of five said they would support a law to ensure enclosed workplaces are smoke-free.\"</p> <p>The charity's new policy document - The Cancer Challenge: Agenda For Change - includes the following top 10 priorities for the next government: <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Implement a national ban on smoking in workplaces and enclosed public places without further delay. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Promote responsible food labelling and marketing, and place limits on the advertising of \"junk\" foods. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Spend 1.5% of the total NHS budget on medical research across the UK. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Recruit and train sufficient personnel for cancer treatment and undertake an evaluation into the need for, and supply of, skilled personnel. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Protect the right of all patients to choose to take genetic tests free from the fear of future discrimination on genetic grounds. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Safeguard the future of publicly-funded research in universities and institutes through sustained investment in infrastructure. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Develop mechanisms, in partnership with research funders, to translate research findings into new treatments. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Collaborate more closely with the scientific community to ensure that increased regulation does not needlessly impede research. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Relieve the indirect tax burden of irrecoverable VAT, which currently affects charities disproportionately. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Implement a comprehensive and mandatory unclaimed assets register to enable charities to find assets originally intended for them.</p>",
  "<p>Many people argue that English spelling is simply awful. George Bernard Shaw reckoned that the English \"spell it so abominably that no man can teach himself what it sounds like\". It is easy to find words like their/there/they're with the same sounds but different spellings. Some words have unique spellings all of their own, such as colonel and yacht. Six out of 10 15-year-olds can't write 10 lines without making at least one spelling mistake and adults struggle with words such as accommodate and broccoli all their lives. </p> <p>By contrast, Noam Chomsky, the greatest linguist of our time, claims the current spelling of English is 'a near optimal system'. He feels that spelling that departs from the pronunciation sometimes helps us to understand what we are reading. Silent letters like the 'g' in sign connect one word to others in which the letters are not silent, such as signature; the fact the past tense ending '-ed' is said in three different ways, 't' (liked), 'd' (played), 'id' (waited) but written in only one, '-ed', makes clear their common meaning.</p> <p>The difference between Shaw and Chomsky comes down to how they think spelling works. One of its functions is indeed to show the sounds of words. The word dog links the letters to the sounds one by one - 'd', 'o' and 'g'. Italian or Finnish use such links virtually all the time. But in English the correspondence between letters and sounds is usually much less straight-forward. Sometimes one letter corresponds to several sounds; the letter 'a' for instance has three different sounds in brat, bravo and brave. Sometimes two letters link to one sound - the 'th' in thin or the 'ng' in wrong. The sequence of letters can be out of step with the sequence of sounds; the 'u' in guess shows the pronunciation of the letter 'g' which occurs before it. Our problems with spelling are often due to not knowing the rules, say the doubling of 'c' and 'm' in accommod-ation or the consonants that go before particular vowels - cemetery ('c' is pronounced 's' before 'e') versus camel ('c' is pronounced 'k' before 'a').</p> <p>With some written symbols, you either know what they mean or you don't have any idea, say '\u00a3', '#' or '%'. You do not have to know how they are said to get their meaning. The second function of spelling is then to show what words mean. Common words like 'the' and 'of' connect directly to their meanings in our minds, rather than being convert-ed into sounds letter by letter. Unique words have to be rememb-er-ed as one-off spellings, such as sapphire or chamois leather (shammy). Some systems of writing, such as Chinese, work primarily by linking whole symbols to meanings in this way. To use English spelling, you have not only to connect letters and sounds but also to remember a host of individual words, whether frequent ones like 'an' or unusual ones like 'Beauchamp'. In other words, English uses spelling both for sounds as assumed by Shaw and for meaning as believed by Chomsky.</p> <p>English spelling is far more systematic than most people sus-pect. The most well-known rule 'i before e except after c' applies to only 11 out of the 10,000 most common words of English - eight forms of receive, plus ceiling, receipt and perceive. Other less familiar rules work far better, for instance the rule that a surname with the same pronunciation as an ordinary word can take a double consonant, Hogg and Bunn rather than hog and bun, or have an extra 'e', Trollope and Wilde instead of 'trollop' and 'wild'. </p> <p>The great asset of English has always been its flexib-ility. Start-ing with a stock of letters borrowed from the Romans, the Irish and German tribes, it has evolved with the Eng-lish language for 1500 years. In the Old English spoken by the Anglo-Saxons every letter corres-ponded to a sound in words such as f\u00e6der (father) and riht (right). After 1066 the system had to cope with a deluge of words derived from French and Latin, such as tricherie (treach-ery) and nice. Over the centuries it has adapted words from many other languages, including coffee from Arabic and Turkish, broccoli from Italian and sushi from Japanese. Whatever the language a word comes from, English spelling can handle it.</p> <p>At the same time the pronunciation of English has been chang-ing. Some Old English sounds died out: the 'h' (pronounced like Scottish 'loch') in riht became the silent 'gh' in right. Long vowels changed their pronun-c-iation between Chaucer and Shake-speare, wine was once said as wean, stone as 'starn'. Punct-uat-ion marks were introduced and their use gradually stabil-ised, the apost-rophe last and most eccentric of all. Because of the changing pronunciation, the rules linking letters and sounds became more complicated and the numb-er of eccentric individual words people had to remember became greater. The sound-based spelling of past tense in barkt, changd and parted gave way to the uniform meaning-based spelling 'ed' in barked, changed and parted.</p> <p>All this change and outside influence has meant that English spelling now presents a rich set of possibilities for our use and entertainment. Pop-groups call themselves: the Beatles, Eminem and Sugababes. Novelists hint at dialects - Wot sort of party was this you was boaf at, anyway? - and think up book titles Pet Semetary. Owners invent names for their houses such as Hi-da Way, for drugs such as Zyrtec, and for race-horses such as Nothin' Leica Dane. Text messages cut down the number of letters: Wot time r u goin 2 b home?</p> <p>It is indeed important for the international use of English that it is not too closely tied to speech. People from Houston, Glasgow, Hong-Kong or Bristol understand each other's writing but might well not under-stand each other's speech. Much world business uses written Eng-lish although the writers are not native speakers. Over three quarters of research papers in biol-ogy are written in English, and more than half of all web pages. Spell-ing and punctuation seldom betray whether an English language news-paper comes from Sant-iago, Kuala Lumpur or Jerus-alem, apart from the choice between American and British styles of spelling in words such as labor/labour. </p> <p>So do we need to get excited about the frequent mistakes that people make when using the English writing system? Mistakes don't necessarily prevent us understanding the message. We still know what cemetary, Mens Toilets or england mean. Spell-check--ers can now handle most of these mistakes without any trouble. A mistake that interferes with the meaning of the message is more serious. The writer may need help or the spelling system itself may need modify-ing. Yet we hard-ly notice similar problems in speech: people are not sent to speech therapy for mispronouncing odd words. No-one suggests that spoken English should be reformed because some people find it hard to say 'th' sounds. The most talented writers make spelling mistakes. Keats once spelled fruit as furuit, W.B. Yeats wrote pecul-iar-ities as peculer-aritys, and Hemingway wrote professional as proffess-ional. Does this detract in any way from their achieve-ments? </p> <p>Our discussions of spelling often suggest that there is an ideal of perfect spelling that people should strive for. Correct spelling and punctuation are seen as injunc--tions carved on tablets of stone: to break them is to trans-gres-s the tacit commandments for civilised behav-iour. Spelling and punctuation can become an emotional rather than rational area of dispute. No individual or institution has ever had the right to lay down the rules of English spelling. Nor are public discussions usually based on accounts of how modern English spelling actually works, but on the traditional rules handed down from the grammarians of the 18th century. Attempts to meddle with the spelling without this kind of factual basis have often been disastrous in the past, land--ing us with the 'b' of debt and the 'c' of scissors. </p> <p>The English writing system is the rich and fertile creation of those who use English. Its rules are not arbitrary commandments, but the ongoing, living response to how people can express their ideas in writ-ing in an ever-devel-oping and changing world. Rather than continually carping about the decline of the English language, as people have been doing since at least the 16th century, we should try to understand and develop the amazing resource that is available to us.</p>",
  "<b>Hurricane Ivan emergency aid</b> <br> Britain will contribute to an international appeal to deal with devastation wreaked by Hurricane Ivan, the international development secretary, Hilary Benn, said. He expressed \"sadness at the loss of life, injury and damage to homes\" across the Caribbean and told MPs that, as well as flying emergency supplies to the region, the UK had also sent two humanitarian advisers to assess what further help was needed. <p><b>Out-of-hours GPs</b><br> Patients should have access to home visits from their GP if they need it and to Saturday morning surgeries under new guidance to be published by the government, the health secretary, John Reid, said. The clarification of doctors' and primary care trusts' responsibilities follows concerns about a new contract allowing GPs to opt-out of providing out-of-hours care. </p> <p><b>Student finance</b><br> Liberal Democrat proposals to invest in students rather than saddle them with huge debts will be a vote winner at the next election, the party predicted. Their education spokesman, Phil Willis, said both the government and Tories exhibited a \"poverty of vision\" over higher education. But his party intended to expand opportunities for all students - regardless of background. </p> <p>In his first Commons appearance as higher education minister, Kim Howells insisted the government had devised a coherent strategy for reform. \"The goal is to provide access to world-class higher education for all of those with the potential to benefit,\" he said. </p> <p><b>Women's pensions</b><br>Women who act as carers, work part time or stay at home to raise children should have an automatic right to a state pension, Steve Webb, for the Liberal Democrats, urged. He said the party's plans for a \"citizen's pension\" based on residency rather than national insurance contributions would end an historic injustice. He added that if pensioners considered themselves second-class citizens in Britain then women were \"third class citizens\" among pensioners. </p> <p>The pensions minister, Malcolm Wicks, said the minimum wage had benefited one million women and reduced the gender pay gap by 2% since 1997. He added: \"If you are concerned about women's pensions, don't start with pensions, start with jobs and incomes. If women earn well during their working lives they are more likely to have decent pensions in retirement.\" </p> <p><b>Army reforms</b><br> The government has no intention of phasing out the Army's regimental system, junior defence minister Lord Bach insisted. Where changes are made, famous names, regional identity and traditions will be maintained wherever possible, he said, adding: \"We have no intention of phasing out the regimental system. Its value is not in doubt but it must adapt as it has done in the past.\" </p> <p><b>Gurkhas row</b><br> The government's review of how immigration laws affect former Gurkhas who served with the British Army is \"nearing the point of conclusion\", Home Office minister Des Browne said. He did not want to pre-empt the conclusions of the review ordered 18 months ago after increasing concerns that the rules are unfair to the Nepalese soldiers. His comments came after Tory former Home Office minister Ann Widdecombe raised the plight of the men - around 250 of whom retire each year after 15 years' service - and appealed to the government to show \"basic, common humanity\". </p> <p><b>'Alphabetism'</b><br> Candidates' names should appear in a random order on ballot papers in certain elections to avoid the danger of \"alphabetism\", Labour's Meg Munn urged. She said there was little evidence that someone whose name appeared at the top had any advantage in a contest, such as in a general election, where just one candidate was returned. But there was a danger of bias in polls where more than one was elected. Her representation of the people (ballot papers) bill gained its first reading but is unlikely to become law. </p> <p><b>New peers</b><br>Former governor of the Bank of England Sir Edward George took his Lords seat on the crossbenches as Lord George. Also taking his seat was crossbenches Lord Kerr of Kinlochard - former diplomatic service head Sir John Kerr. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The primemMinister and Tory leader Michael Howard face each other at Commons question time. Earlier Welsh secretary Peter Hain responds to MPs. The hunting bill is set to clear all its stages through the House. There are backbench debates in Westminster Hall. </p> <p>The Lords debates the Christmas Day (trading) bill's report stage, the armed forces (pensions and compensation) bill's third reading, the civil contingencies bill's committee stage and a written constitution.</p>",
  "<p> As mobile phones become more and more sophisticated, our expectations of the games that appear on them are increasing too. But should they be? Are some developers guilty of trying to squeeze too much out of a currently limited platform? We asked Phil Marley, who has designed both mobile phone and console games at <a href=\"http://www.kujuwireless.com\">Kuju Entertainment</a>, to come up with ten rules for better mobile game design.</p> <p>If you've ever found yourself getting frustrated with unfriendly controls, rickety level design or poor responsiveness after downloading the latest console to mobile conversion, read on\u2026</p> <p><strong>Phones aren't built for playing games on</strong> The developer's dream of a handset with GameBoy Advance-quality shoulder buttons and a proper D-pad remains just a dream. Most handsets have small, cramped buttons that are awkward to get at. Many don't respond if you press more than one button at once (which means a gameplay staple - the running jump - needs careful thought). Keep the number of controls down, especially in a fast action game.</p> <p><strong>Players aren't gamers</strong> Now that everyone and their dog has a mobile, the chances of your latest title being downloaded by someone who's never played a video game before - on any platform - becomes quite high. Don't assume any knowledge, and include a tutorial level to teach the basics so that the player doesn't have to wade through pages of instructions.</p> <p><strong>Players get distracted</strong> Make pausing easy - and ideally, make it possible to drop out of the game completely and return to pick up where you left off. Mobile gamers have distractions that console gamers don't - reaching their stop on a train, talking to a friend, shuffling past someone on the tube. It's okay to punish players for looking away from the screen, but make sure that they never have to retrace their steps for more than ten or twenty seconds.</p> <p><strong>Short and fun wins over long and dull</strong> No-one expects to get 30 hours of gameplay from a mobile phone game. Given a set budget, it's far better to deliver a high-quality three hour experience than a poor ten hour one. Include secret levels and unlockables for practised gamers who will complete it in an hour - reward them for replaying. Be realistic - players only have a limited amount of space on their phones and games get swapped in and out just as ringtones do - they're disposable. Remember, if a player's only playing for five minutes a day, even two hours of gameplay will last for over three weeks, by which point the player's ready for something new.</p> <p><strong>The development world has changed</strong> When arcade games on a mobile became viable, everyone raided eighties arcade machines for ideas, and we saw tens of different versions of the same few games. We're getting past that now, and we're beginning to see more adventurous concepts akin to SNES and Master System-era games. The higher-end platforms are already pushing towards Doom-era 3D (though with such a small screen size, 2D certainly still has some advantages). We've gone from text-only WAP games to 3D in a scant few years. Simultaneously, the number of developers in the field has shot up. This means that it's easy to get left behind if you don't have both good technology people keeping you at the cutting edge and good marketing people finding you licenses to work with and making sure your games get seen. We're very fortunate to have both at Kuju.</p> <p><strong>Don't let technology take over</strong> It's great to support the latest technology, but past a certain point you begin to limit your market to early adopters. If your latest game is based around technology that's only going to be found in the highest-end business handsets for the next six months (WiFi, anyone?), ask yourself if you're really going to sell many copies.</p> <p><strong>Plan for lots of versions</strong> Lots of different handsets, screen resolutions, music handling capabilities, control layouts, processor speeds. Until there's a standard (something like what Microsoft pushed for with the Multimedia PC long ago) every title launch is going to either have a huge amount of different versions, or limit itself to only the more popular handsets.</p> <p><strong>Forget the plot</strong> Given that you don't typically have space for lots of pre-recorded speech, any plot is going to have to fit within the in-game action and the occasional screen of text. A screen will only hold a few short sentences even on the largest versions, and no-one wants to read more than a few of these before each level. So forget your multi-layered conspiracy theory epic: what you can't write in a handful of paragraphs isn't going to happen. If you can, mix the plot into the in-game action to break things up (in Judge Dredd we had our characters talking in comic book-style speech balloons at key points).</p> <p><strong>Accept the limitations\u2026</strong> Too many mobile games carry across baggage from console versions. In some cases, it's great to have a mobile phone game that looks like a shrunk-down version of its console cousin. But don't include unnecessary screen clutter and complex menu systems just because they look good when you see them on a 28\" widescreen TV. Forget loading and saving - make it transparent to drop out of the game and continue it again. Forget profiles that allow different players to save their progress (how often do you lend your mobile phone to someone else, anyway?). Strip everything down to its basics.</p> <p><strong>\u2026And embrace the advantages</strong> Make use of the handset's advantages over a console. Can you use Bluetooth? Offer downloadable content? Let hundreds of players play at the same time? Integrate the phone's camera into the game? In Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure we're using the phone's keypad to simulate the time-travelling phone booth in the film - dial a date and you're taken to that year!</p>",

  "<p><strong>Jo Williams, chief executive of charity Mencap</strong><br> The biggest change over the past 25 years has been that 65,000 people have moved out of hospitals and into the community. This has transformed people's lives and has allowed them to experience things you and I take for granted. It all came out of the 1971 white paper entitled Better Services for the Mentally Handicapped. It has allowed them to choose what they wear and what they eat. They can decide to go out and enjoy local facilities like the shops. It's helped thousands of people feel able to participate and feel they have control over their lives. Having more people in the community makes them feel different about themselves. It gives them more confidence. They start to take more of an interest in things. But unfortunately there are still people in hospital and living in institutions who would choose to live in the community if the support systems were available to them.</p> <p><strong>Richard Best, director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</strong><br>Longer lives, fewer babies. Living longer represents the most fundamental change of the last quarter century. More years on the planet. More chances for fulfilment. But a future 25 years hence with a smaller proportion of workers and taxpayers. And a larger proportion of the population needing pensions and care. Immigration can help change the balance. But longer lives mean we do not vacate our homes so soon. This is adding pressure to the intense shortages of affordable housing. If the country stays rich, we can pay for pensions and care. If taxpayers get less mean, we can do this through the state. Or if we save more and work longer, we may pay for ourselves. But irrespective of the strength of the UK economy, we are more reluctant than 25 years ago to build enough homes for the next generation. And that problem seems destined to get worse - despite the government's good intentions.</p> <p><strong>Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the British Medical Association's general practitioners' committee and a GP in Bridlington, East Yorkshire</strong><br>I entered practice as a GP in 1978 so have had direct experience of the multitude of changes in the health service over the past 25 years. From the market economy of the Thatcher era to the modernisations of the current government, the NHS continues to be a political football. Recently there has been a real increase in resources, but with general practice dealing with more than 90% of all NHS patient contacts, even this welcome increase only starts to address the problems. I'd like to be able to say that family doctors now have an easier life than they did a quarter of a century ago, but while the way we work is changing, there's more to do than ever. Back in 1979, most GPs did their own on-call after a full day in surgery. Those days (and nights) have gone, but nevertheless developments in medicine mean we can now do much more for our patients. But patients' expectations have risen too, sometimes driven up unrealistically by political pronouncements. In April this year a new national GP contract came into force. Over time, it should encourage doctors into general practice and help ease the current shortage. It will deliver higher quality care for patients. It's a real change for the better.</p> <p><strong>James Johnson, chairman of the British Medical Association</strong><br>Over the past 25 years we have seen interminable changes to the way the health service is organised by just about every government that came along. In many instances the changes were a waste of time, effort and money. Successive governments have wrestled with how to pay for the ever more complex issue of medicine. Governments, starting with Mrs Thatcher, have been trying to deal with this by moving away from centralism and bringing in a \"market economy\". The implication of having a market is that on the one hand people can make profits and on the other people who don't succeed go bust. Markets can be vicious. This isn't to say they cannot deliver improvements for patients, but among NHS providers there will be losers as well as winners. The current proposal for a single tariff for NHS work, giving provider status to anyone who meets the standard and can deliver on the price, is the latest \"market\" model for the NHS. There have been tangible improvements for patients over the past 25 years, such as waiting times coming down. Medicine itself has changed. For example, patients used to have operations for peptic ulcers. New drug treatments mean these are now extremely rare. Increased investment in the NHS is perhaps the best change of all.</p> <p><strong>Denise Platt, chairwoman of the Commission for Social Care Inspection</strong><br> One of the most important changes has been the Children Act 1989, which put children firmly at the centre of the agenda. It was a piece of legislation that came in for a lot of PC [politically correct] knocking in its later life, but it was a good start on focusing on the needs of children. Another thing that was significant was Frank Dobson when he was health secretary talking about the Berlin walls in health and social services. It set in train a whole range of decisions about health and social services which isn't completed. And I've also noticed over the past 25 years the increasing impact of inquiries on policy. It's not just Climbi\u00e9, it includes the Bristol hospital inquiry and inquiries into mental health. It's almost as if in the social care field good policy is only developed when something dramatic has happened or the service has gained public attention. Before 1979 there were inquiries but they did not have the same major impact. Unfortunately in some cases they can lead to knee-jerk reactions after specific failings at certain councils are blown up to become a major national issue. But the Climbi\u00e9 inquiry has led the government to take a welcome look at the whole of children's services.</p> <p><strong>Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations</strong><br> Just over 25 years ago the Wolfenden Committee published a report on the future of the voluntary sector which portrayed a vibrant sector that had been enjoying sporadic growth, both in campaigning and service delivery, since the early sixties. The sector's income was estimated to be somewhere between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn. There were 120,000 registered charities and an estimated 20,000 paid staff. Recognising the added value that voluntary organisations bring to public services, although they never would have used this New Labour terminology, the committee's key prediction was growth in this area. The 2004 Voluntary Sector Almanac showed that public sector income is now a key driver for the sector and accounts for 37% of the sector's total income. Income is now over \u00a320bn, the voluntary sector workforce now numbers over 500,000 and there are almost 200,000 registered charities. The last quarter century has been dominated by the sector's professionalisation, the formalisation of its relationship with government culminating with the signing of the Compact agreement, as well as growth in political campaigning. Nonetheless, many of the key issues for the future are the same as they were in 1978: independence, infrastructure, maintaining public trust and confidence and balancing the needs of large and small voluntary organisations. </p> <p><strong>Terry Butler, social services director of Hampshire county council</strong><br> I believe the most positive movement we have experienced has been \"user empowerment\", more recently labelled \"choice\" and \"personalisation\". Great strides have been made, but there is still a long way to go. There is no more empowering tool than direct payments. It began in Hampshire about 20 years ago when a group of articulate young men with physical disabilities demanded we gave them the resources to manage their own care. So we \"laundered\" cash through a voluntary organisation and created support worker and personal assistant roles to make it happen. Now direct payments are on the statute book for all user groups. The user movement is still struggling against patronising attitudes, over-bureaucratic restrictions and, more recently, acute risk aversion. At worst, community care \"needs assessments\" for individuals have been become \"risk assessments\", when what we really need are \"potential assessments\" - based on individuals' aspirations, potential and expectations of services. I'm also concerned that, with every agency involved proclaiming themselves \"champion of the users\", what space is left for users to be their own advocates? Nevertheless, the movement continues to gain momentum and now all major political parties place choice at the top of their agendas.</p>",
  "<p>France's largest media group, Vivendi Universal, yesterday revealed that first-half net losses had nearly trebled to \u20ac1.86bn (\u00a31.26bn).

  "Lying amid the debris strewn near Al-Karkh police station was the photo of a young man in a blue T-shirt. The passport snap had been part of his application to join Iraq's police force. <p>Yesterday, however, he and dozens of other recruits queueing outside the station in central Baghdad were blown to pieces by a car bomb. Near the photo, someone had heaped the shoes of the dead and injured into a neat pile. </p> <p>The destruction from the suspected suicide blast which killed 47 people and injured 114 was everywhere: bits of metal, glass, a broken billiard table, a dead bird and pools of blood. </p> <p>There was nothing left of the recruit in the photo. </p> <p>\"The bomb went off at 10am. A lot of people were queueing up to join the police,\" said Allah Hamas, 31, who owns Allah's Famous Falafel Stand, next to the police station. </p> <p>\"I handed a customer a sandwich. Suddenly there was an explosion and a piece of metal ripped off the top of his head. </p> <p>\"After that I ran out to help. We covered the dead with blankets. I saw at least 30 bodies. Thirteen of them were burnt completely. Some people were scattered into pieces. We found them among their files and photos.\" </p> <p>It was the deadliest single incident in the Iraqi capital for six months, but there was nothing unique about the explosion; it took place a few hundred metres from Haifa Street, a well-known centre of resistance to the American occupation and the scene of heavy fighting on Sunday. It was embarrassingly close to the green zone and the US embassy. </p> <p>But it reveals a grim truth about the nature of Iraq's evolving insurgency: Iraqis are killing Iraqis. </p> <p>In recent months, and especially since the handover of \"power\" to the unelected interim government, Iraq's resistance has concentrated its efforts on killing those who collaborate with the Americans - the police officers, would-be police officers, translators, governors and government officials. </p> <p>It is beginning to look like, and feel like, civil war. </p> <p>In another incident yesterday, gunmen ambushed a minibus full of policeman in Baquba, north-west of Baghdad, killing 11 of them and a civilian. They were on their way home to their base. </p> <p>In Ramadi, clashes between US troops and insurgents left eight dead and 18 wounded. </p> <p>Responsibility for the attacks in Baghdad and Baquba was claimed yesterday by Tawhid and Jihad, Iraq's shadowy and fastest-growing militant group, which is allegedly linked to the Jordanian al-Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. </p> <p>In reality, though, the real identities of the insurgents remain opaque. They undoubtedly include a handful of foreign fighters, but the majority are Iraqi nationalists violently opposed to the continuing occupation of their country. </p> <p>\"What happened here has really got nothing to do with Islam,\" said Rafid Ahmed, whose shop in Al-Karkh was destroyed. </p> <p>Mr Ahmed said his two neighbours in the next-door barber's shop were killed. He survived only because he opened up late. </p> <p>\"Why are these people targeting Iraqi police recruits? They just want to get a salary because they are unemployed,\" he said. \"The people who did this are terrorists.\" </p> <p>What would he do now? \"Wait and see,\" he said. \"This store provided an income for a whole family.\" </p> <p>In the row of ruined neighbouring shops there were bloodstains on the ceilings. A few metres away, beyond a pavement strewn with rubble and bits of tree, the explosion had dug a large crater. The blackened engine of the car had landed 30 metres away. </p> <p>Mingled with the smell of incinerated metal was something else: burnt flesh. </p> <p>Another witness, Raad Tawfiq, 40, contradicted the claims of Tawhid and Jihad. \"It wasn't a suicide bomb,\" he said. \"They blew the car up by remote control. People in the restaurant spotted them leaving, but it was too late. </p> <p>\"This was a massacre,\" he said. </p> <p>In the run-up to the January elections, Iraq's pro-US interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, faces some stark choices.

  "Ariel Sharon has threatened that Yasser Arafat will meet the same fate as Hamas leaders who were assassinated earlier this year by the Israeli military. <p>In ambiguous comments to Israeli newspapers to mark the Jewish new year, the prime minister said he intends to force the Palestinian leader into exile. But he also hinted that Mr Arafat might be killed. </p> <p>Speaking to Ma'ariv newspaper, Mr Sharon made direct reference to the Hamas spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who was assassinated by a missile in Gaza in March, and his successor as the Islamic resistance movement's leader, Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi, who was killed by the Israelis the following month. </p> <p>\"We operated against Ahmed Yassin and Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi when we thought the time was suitable. On the matter of Arafat we'll operate in the same way, when we find the convenient and suitable time. One needs to find the time and to do what has to be done,\" said Mr Sharon. </p> <p>However, the prime minister told other newspapers that he would send Mr Arafat into exile. Sheikh Yassin and Mr al-Rantissi were both exiled from the occupied territories at one time. </p> <p>A prominent Palestinian minister, Saeb Erekat, said Mr Sharon's comments show that he intends \"to kill President Arafat and to push the Palestinian people toward chaos\". </p> <p>But the Israeli prime minister's son, Omri, a member of parliament, said that the possibility of assassination \"does not exist\" and that Israel should leave Mr Arafat \"stuck\" in his battered Ramallah compound. </p> <p>\"If we do this foolishness and hit him, will an [alternative Palestinian leader] arise? No, he will be seen as your collaborator,\" Omri Sharon told members of the ruling Likud's central committee. </p> <p>In April, Mr Sharon backed away from a personal pledge to President Bush not to harm the Palestinian leader by saying that whoever kills Jews or orders their deaths \"is a marked man\". </p> <p>However, it is thought unlikely the prime minister intends to move against Mr Arafat in the near future. The threat may be timed to try to reassure critics on the far right that the government's plan to pull 7,500 Jews out of the Gaza strip, and a small number from a part of the West Bank, does not represent a weakening of its resolve to confront the Palestinian leadership. </p> <p>Mr Sharon's security cabinet yesterday approved steps to begin the Gaza pullout, including compensation payments to Jewish settlers of up to \u00a3280,000. The government is offering bonuses to settlers who agree to leave of their own accord in the hope of defusing resistance to the pullout. </p> <p>The government expects to spend \u00a3350m compensating settlers and a similar amount moving military installations and other infrastructure. </p> <p>Mr Sharon also rebuffed pressure from his finance minister and chief political rival, Binyamin Netanyahu, for a referendum on the withdrawal. </p> <p>Mr Netanyahu argues that a ballot would lend legitimacy to the \"disengagement plan\" and weaken claims by the settlers and the far right that Mr Sharon is acting undemocratically by ignoring a poll within his Likud party that rejected the pullout. </p> <p>Mr Netanyahu said that without a vote there could be an \"explosion\" of resistance by the settlers and their supporters. But the prime minister accused him of siding with the settlers. </p> <p>\"The real intention is to delay implementation,\" said Mr Sharon. \"If a minister thinks that we are facing an explosion, he needs to act with all his might to make sure that there is no explosion, so that no one might even contemplate that by means of threats of explosion a cabinet decision can be changed. Instead of stamping a seal of approval on those threats and capitulating to them, I would expect from him and the other ministers to express in the strongest terms possible their opposition to threats.\" </p> <p>The police said they were investigating death threats against Mr Sharon and officials responsible for implementing disengagement. </p> <p>Jerusalem's chief of police, Ilan Franco, said: \"We have opened an intensive investigation regarding threats that have been received in recent days. The threats were to murder the prime minister and officials in the administration.\" </p> <p>The Israeli news service, YNet, quoted officials from the Shin Bet security service as saying they feared for Mr Sharon's safety and \"would prefer for the prime minister to avoid leaving his office\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Masked gunmen shot dead an accused rapist on his way to court in the West Bank city of Ramallah yesterday. </p> <p>The shooting marked the second fatal attack in less than two months on detainees in the custody of Palestinian security forces. </p> <p>Palestinians have faced internal strife recently, stirred by militants complaining of corruption in the Palestinian security forces. The gunmen attacked the car in which Ramy Yaghmour and other detainees were travelling from the Palestinian special forces headquarters.</p>",
  "Could there be a general election in the offing? Just as a first swallow or bronzed leaf denotes a coming change of season, so the tax-haters are stirring. <p>\"The pips could hardly squeak any louder,\" bemoans the Daily Telegraph melodramatically, referring not to Britain's rich but to our middle classes. These impecunious victims of a \"confiscatory\" tax regime are apparently \"overtaxed, overstretched and underpaid\". </p> <p>In the London Evening Standard - nowadays a Mini-Me of its sister paper the Daily Mail - the headlined lament \"Broke every month\" appears above a picture of two management consultants with a combined annual income of \u00a380,000. The paper wails that inflation since 1997 - just to pick a year at random - has risen by 18%. (In letters a third of the size, you might decipher beneath that an average London salary has risen by almost 50% in the same period.) </p> <p>And in the pages of the Mail on Sunday the somnolent beast that is Lord Rees-Mogg awakens, urging the Conservative party to focus on tax. As if in Pavlovian response, the government itself leaks promises of plans for \"fewer carrots, more of the stick\" in paying benefits to the long-term sick. </p> <p>The leisured rich have often been mean. A newly published history of a country estate, The Big House, reveals that Venetia Cavendish-Bentinck, once chatelaine of Sledmere in Yorkshire, was so tight that she recycled unwanted milk from the cat's dish for her guests, bought bacon from the butcher on sale-or-return and preferred to entertain Catholics on Fridays because fish was cheaper than meat. </p> <p>Friends of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles complain that the couple's \"most drearily boring\" subject of dinner conversation is \"the price of everything nowadays\". And the prince's mother, while occasionally bemoaning her son's extravagance, certainly doesn't throw money around. Staff at Sandringham each received a potted chrysanthemum from the Queen as a Christmas present some years ago. It came with a handwritten note saying: \"When the plant dies, please return the pot to the head gardener.\" </p> <p>A quaint aristocratic unwillingness to pay the tailor, the grocer or the domestics properly has elided understandably over the centuries into an equally quaint unwillingness to pay the taxman. Lloyd George might have believed that death was a \"most convenient time to tax rich people\", but it didn't stop Vita Sackville-West whingeing bitterly half a century ago that \"the socialists\" had stolen her ancestral home. </p> <p>Knole - with its celebrated 365 rooms, 52 staircases and seven courtyards - had actually passed to the National Trust in lieu of inheritance tax. When I inquired this week, the Sackville-West family was still in residence \"in part of the house\". They are struggling by, we can only assume, on a few dozen rooms, a handful of staircases and perhaps just the one measly courtyard, a generosity not extended to most victims of repossession. </p> <p>It was Lady Thatcher, with her most unaristocratic background, who triumphantly turned tax-cutting into a political fetish for the middle classes, successfully persuading them that they had never had it so bad. She boasts proudly in The Downing Street Years that cutting the top rate of income tax to 40% in 1988 was \"a huge boost to incentives, particularly for those talented, internationally mobile people so essential to economic success\". </p> <p>But if lowering tax rates for high earners was quite so critical to economic growth, why was it a full nine years after Thatcher's arrival in Downing Street before she delivered them? And how on earth was she able to mastermind an \"economic miracle\" in the meantime? </p> <p>We may be one of the five richest nations in the world but the Child Poverty Action Group confirms that in 2004, one in 10 pupils in Britain are deterred from eating school meals by the cost. Yet research regularly demonstrates that the poor give much more generously to charity than the rich. </p> <p>Perhaps the government's coyness about arguing publicly for investment in tackling poverty comes from the centre. Shortly before his arrival at the heart of the Downing Street policy machine in 1997, Andrew Adonis wrote that: \"rejecting postwar notions of social cohesion, by the late 1980s the professional and managerial elite was unapologetic about the explosion of income differentials\". The sadness of Adonis's words is that no one seems to have been prepared since 1997 to point out politely to the \"professional and managerial elite\" that, in fact, they have never had it so good. </p> <p>The fiscally dubious rot set in in the early 1980s. Swivel-eyed admirers of Milton Friedman, the monetarist who inspired both Reaganomics and Thatcherism, were seduced by a tax model of \"sleepers\" and \"thrusters\". Human nature, conservatives became convinced, meant that most individuals were \"thrusters\", motivated by lower taxes to work harder, rather than \"sleepers\", who merely take advantage of lower taxes to slacken off. </p> <p>This tendentious claim has beguiled politicians ever since. In the past four years, George Bush has delivered almost $400bn of tax cuts for America's rich. Meanwhile, the legacy left to the children of the American poor is the biggest budget deficit in US history. </p> <p>But sadly, alarm at Bush's divisiveness hasn't informed our political discourse. Even the Liberal Democrats, who bravely fought a string of elections with a pledge to put a penny on tax, yesterday quietly sidelined the promise. </p> <p>Two decades after Friedman's ascendance, it seems now that it's only the rich who can be motivated to work harder by the prospect of greater wealth. And the poor? Requiring in contrast the threat of even greater poverty, they must be encouraged with \"more of the stick\". </p> <p> <b> The Staggers lurches along</b> </p> <p>Shed a tear for the staff of the New Statesman. They are reported to be \"seething\" after the engaging pundit and pointyhead Will Hutton noted that its weekly circulation is now exceeded by that of the eclectic young leftwing magazine Progress. </p> <p>So what does the Staggers, once home to the writing of VS Pritchett, John Maynard Keynes and Virginia Woolf, have to offer readers this week? One columnist, apparently so good that she is trailed on the front cover, instructs female readers to \"avoid men who drink chilled white wine\". </p> <p>If this is all redolent of legendary Sunday Express editor Sir John Junor, who once opined that \"only poofs drink white wine\", perhaps it's not surprising. The New Statesman's deputy editor Cristina Odone wrote a stirring piece six years ago marking equalisation of the age of consent at 16 for young gay people. \"In vain,\" Odone moaned, \"the moral minority condemned the 'paedophile's charter'.\" </p> <p>As Junor liked to say, do pass the sickbag.</p>",
  "<p>I don't know what I expected from visiting al-Jazeera's HQ. I had had run-ins with the station in the past. Once, for example, I felt compelled to protest when its Baghdad reporter asked live on air whether the House of Commons had debated \"reports of British soldiers executing Iraqi prisoners of war after taking them prisoner\". There had been no such reports, so far as we were aware, and certainly no such executions. </p> <p>More vocal, perhaps, were the complaints we made over gory coverage of UK casualties and the concerns we raised over the use of Osama bin Laden videos of unknown provenance and unclear intent. They were unapologetic about both. \"War is war. It produces carnage and death,\" says Wadah Khanfar, its managing director. \"Part of our job is to show that.\" </p> <p>As for the videos, the Jordanian-born head of the Qatar-based station says they are aware of the dangers of being exploited. They take care to authenticate Bin Laden's voice. They never show the videos in full. They edit out anything that could be taken as an exhortation to kill. </p> <p>But Bin Laden is a major figure in current affairs, he insists, not unreasonably. If the videos went to the BBC or CNN, they would happily use them. They go to al-Jazeera, he says, because, \"We are more trusted and credible in the region.\" </p> <p>Despite their robustness on the specific, they struck me as quite defensive in general. Though clearly proud of the impact they have made, in less than a decade of existence, they appear genuinely at a loss to know why they have become a source of such controversy, and a target of attack from US politicians in particular. Part of them seems pleased. \"The more Rumsfeld attacks us, the more popular we are with our viewers,\" says the station's communications director, Jihad Ballout. </p> <p>But Khanfar's view is that the Americans fail to see the wider significance of al-Jazeera. \"The Americans call for reform. They call for freedom of expression. For democratisation, liberalisation. We have been part of that process, helping create real and lasting change in society, give people a voice. We are part of the march towards reform in the Middle East. They cannot see it,\" he says. Jihad Ballout adds: \"We have broken many political and social taboos in the region. But the main contact we get from the Americans is the attacks from the politicians and the visits from the ambassador complaining about our coverage.\" </p> <p>That night, channel hopping in my Doha hotel room, I had a clearer understanding of Khanfar's point. In look, and feel, al-Jazeera is now not unlike American or European 24-hour news channels. Presenters attempting gravitas, not always with success. Pictures as lively and graphic as possible. The bottom of the screen busy with explanations of stories that are coming or have just gone. When a major international story is running, it is sometimes only the language that really sets the channels apart. </p> <p>But sandwiched in between are the state-controlled television stations of the region. Omani TV news leads with pictures of the sultan shaking hands with a succession of smiling men leaving his palace, soothing music the only commentary. Kuwaiti TV has happy children singing traditional songs. Saudi TV is broadcasting prayers from a mosque. Raised on the BBC, we are so used to a modern, vibrant media that perhaps we underestimate the scale of change that al-Jazeera has wrought in the region, given relative freedom by its main backer, the Emir of Qatar. It also explains why several Arab regimes have condemned it from time to time - most recently the interim Iraqi government which shut its office in Baghdad. </p> <p>To the western eye, the station is presenting events unashamedly from an Arab perspective, particularly its coverage of the Israel-Palestine question. Given the makeup of its viewers, this is hardly surprising. Nor is its Iraq coverage comfortable viewing. But as it presses on with plans for an English language service, expanding its 23 bureaux and rebranding itself as \"al-Jazeera International\", it may be time for American and other western governments to think afresh about how to deal with it. </p> <p>When I worked for the government, we established in the Foreign Office an Islamic media unit whose task was to reach out both to the Muslim community at home and the Arab media abroad. Though small in number, the team was highly effective. The then head, a 29-year-old fluent Arabic speaker named Gerard Russell, regularly appeared on al-Jazeera and other Arab media. Once it noticed that we were making an effort, the channel regularly asked for other western voices. On my visit to Qatar, where I was speaking at an unrelated conference, I found myself invited on live to talk about current events, and the next day I was asked to do a sit-down, half-hour interview with a former London correspondent. As expected, he mainly focused on Iraq, the Middle East, the Bush-Blair relationship, and \"spin\", but I was more struck by his good old-fashioned view that interviewers ask a question, hear the answer, then ask a follow-up and so let a conversation flow. </p> <p>It was partly to get the chance to visit al-Jazeera that I accepted the offer to speak at the conference in Qatar. Because of where it is and the scale of change it represents, it is a fascinating political and media story. Whenever I spend time in British or other western TV stations, my views of them tend to be reinforced by the experience. Here, I found my mind opening to the possibility of a very different perspective to the one I had arrived with. </p> <p>Though al-Jazeera has the same 24 hours to fill, it is a tiny operation compared to Sky News, let alone the BBC. The newsroom is about a third the size of the newsroom at BBC Bristol. The canteen is minuscule. As the al-Jazeera phenomenon has grown, so has the collection of Portakabins that house many of the staff. There is one control room, again a fraction of the size of any I have seen in the west, with a young North African directing a young, multinational team. There was a hand-to-mouth feel to activity inside the studio. A few seconds before we were due live on air, the floor manager was under the desk trying to plug in my connection to an interpreter, who seemed to share my surprise that one of the first questions was about a poll on the relative merits of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. My meeting with the senior management forms a small part of a Channel 5 documentary being broadcast tonight, which covers my transition from Downing Street to something approaching a more normal life. But what that cannot capture, in the way a series of meetings over a couple of days could, is the complexity of al-Jazeera's situation. I thought they would be cocky and brash because they had made themselves into the media story of the last decade. In fact, I found them worried about the way they were perceived, and genuinely perplexed by what they saw as a one-dimensional American view of their output. They see themselves as agents of change, but condemned as part of a dangerous status quo. They report anti-Americanism, but deny anti-Americanism is part of their ethos. There is widespread coverage of anti-Americanism in South America and Asia, even in Japan, says Khanfar. But it goes unnoticed. \"We are unfairly treated in the way we are singled out.\" </p> <p>I thought they would be more hostile to Britain. Blair as Bush's poodle was a line I heard more than once (always accompanied by the observation that the jibe was coined in the west and not by them.) But though the hostility to President Bush was clear, there was a greater understanding of the complexities of the Blair position than I had expected. Some felt that at least he was trying on the Middle East and understood the urgency, even if - in their view because of the Americans and Israelis - he was not getting as far or as fast as he would like. </p> <p>On one occasion, a woman member of the al-Jazeera staff asked the Channel 5 people to stop filming and asked to speak to me away from any cameras. She was close to tears. She was from Iraq. She said, \"Please tell Blair that he did the right thing, and my family are grateful that Saddam has gone.\" She said that there were more who thought it than we might think, even if it was not the done thing to say so. </p> <p>I left the small dusty compound wishing I had found time to go there, as Gerard Russell had urged me to, when I had been in Downing Street. I wish we had done more to persuade the Americans that like them or not, al-Jazeera represents an opportunity as well as a potential threat. It is why I argued that the ability to communicate on pan-Arab media should be an important consideration in ambassadorial appointments to the region. Qatar is a country of just 500,000 people. British or American faces with good links to al-Jazeera can reach millions on a regular basis. </p> <p>It may well be that Jihad Ballout - could there be a better name for an Arab spin doctor? - saw me coming and put together a very effective operation to lead me to a more measured view than the one I left London with. It may simply be that they have a point, and they put it well. Whether I was lulled or not, the truth is that the station is now a significant media player. It will become more so when the English language service comes on stream. Western politicians should feel free to attack it if they think it deserves it. But there is a case for a more engaged approach. It is no good just complaining that your policy is constantly misrepresented. You have to engage in the task of putting your case, whatever you think of the medium, and you will probably do the job better if you try to understand where the medium is coming from. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> What Makes Alastair Campbell Run? will be broadcast tonight on Channel 5 at 8pm.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Who's afraid of Mrs T?</strong></p> <p><em>Society Guardian, then called Society Tomorrow, launched on September 19, 1979. In the first article, Malcolm Dean - then, as now, a Guardian leader writer - considered the likely impact of the newly-elected Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. </em></p> <p> If at any other time in the 34 years since the second world war, a column such as this had been launched there was one forecast that could have been confidently predicted about Society Tomorrow. It was going to get better. But for the first time since the founding of the welfare state, this is no longer true. If Mrs Thatcher proceeds with the cuts she has threatened, society today looks far preferable to society tomorrow ... </p> <p>If a Labour government had won in May, there would have been some cuts to services. But nothing like the size of the cuts that the Conservatives have been considering. These are unprecedented. </p> <p>Traditionally, social policy ministers have relied on the expansion of services to establish their reputations. This has been just as true of Conservative ministers as Labour secretaries of state. The biggest applause, for example, at the 1973 Conservative party conference - the last when they were in office - was reserved for Sir Keith Joseph, who was able to proudly tick off six new social security benefits to the delight of the delegates present. (Even then, he conceded, he had not done nearly enough). </p> <p>There is nothing new in this tradition. It was, after all, an annual Conservative conference that imposed on a reluctant party leader ship in 1950 the target of building 300,000 houses a year - a policy that helped Harold Macmillan, who inherited it, eventually to reach Number 10. </p> <p>RA Butler was in a similar situation in 1941. Keen to push forward with his reforms, Butler found his prime minister, [Winston] Churchill, utterly opposed to the reform of secondary education. The Treasury, too, was following its traditional cautious line ... </p> <p>So what did Butler do? ... He proceeded to push ahead and develop the education proposals his civil servants had drawn up. The result? The 1944 Education Act 2, one of the major reforms of the 20th century. </p> <p>So much for prime ministerial dictates. If Churchill can be outflanked, who's afraid of Mrs T? <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Malcolm Dean, September 19, 1979. </p> <p><strong> Computer divorcing</strong> <br><em>The internet revolution was at least 15 years away when we reported in 1982 on the impact of the Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES). </em></p> <p> What will happen to social relationships when electronics allow us to communicate easily and cheaply with large numbers of people simultaneously, using our own private message systems? </p> <p>Some insights into the effects of modern communications techniques have now come out of a five-year experiment by the New Jersey Institute of Technology into new ways of letting scientists share their results with each other. </p> <p>Over 1,500 people were provided with terminals (usually like small telex machines) linked by phone line to a central computer, through which messages could be sent to anyone else on the network. </p> <p>It was soon discovered that a whole new medium of communication had been invented, with impact not just on the participants' work but on their whole lives, leading to new personal relationships, new working methods, dependence, addiction, and at least two divorces. </p> <p>Users compose their messages on a keyboard like that of a typewriter, and receive information back either on a linked teleprinter or a screen. They \"log on\" to the system whenever they feel like it by switching on their terminals. The central computer stores the messages, and tells users when they log on what new information is waiting for them. </p> <p>People set up terminals at home as well as in the office so they could use EIES at any hour of the day or night. They changed their working methods so that almost everything they did went through the machine, causing drastic problems whenever there were equipment failures. \"I can't think when the computer is down,\" they would complain. </p> <p>Wives, on the other hand, would complain when the machine was not down. \"You don't talk to me now - you're always on that damned computer,\" was heard a good many times.

We talked to Raza, a young Pakistani officer, about his experiences as a Metropolitan police trainee. </em> </p> <p> Everyone in the group wrote their life history as an essay. This was followed by a talk from each trainee. When Raza's turn came, every person in the room appeared surprised, even shocked. The training sergeant was just as ignorant about his Punjabi village background as the rest. Raza had imagined, vaguely, that police educationalists would have \"done some homework\" about British minority groups. </p> <p>Perhaps it was the training sergeants' lack of \"homework\" that created the habit which upset Raza so greatly at this time. They made it their business to create a constant barrage of remarks of a racial kind ...</p> <p>\"Elephant boy!\" </p> <p>\"You coon!\" </p> <p>His comrades began to use these same terms. If the training sergeants saw fit, then shouldn't they? The official excuse was that this was good conditioning for Raza. </p> <p>\"Get a lot of remarks like this, you will, good hardening for you.\" </p> <p>Raza feels, in retrospect, that the conditioning \"bounced\" back and resulted in his previously well-disposed colleagues accepting a tolerated negative attitude towards minority group members. </p> <p>Raza's depression was worsened by overheard remarks: </p> <p>\"That Paki's failed his exams at Police College once you know.\" </p> <p>\"He's a Muslim, doesn't like women.\" </p> <p>\"Just a wog, like the rest of them.\" </p> <p>He decided to make an effort to counteract the impressions. So far, Raza had escaped making the senior men's breakfast. Now he offered to cook the deeply-loathed bacon. He thought: \"I must get on with them. I chose this job, after all.\" </p> <p>That same morning a WPC remarked that Asian women who give birth to daughters are divorced by their husbands, and the children distributed between the relatives. Raza was so disturbed he could not reply, and left the table hastily. </p> <p>Raza considers himself a competent policeman, in spite of an unsupported training. Hostility in the station is less, racist remarks just as common. A community relations officer informed a group of constables that the West Indian who had been promoted at another station was promoted for political reasons. He wouldn't be clever enough. Wogs aren't, are they? Raza feels the racist attitudes are deeply ingrained, founded in confusion. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Moira Meecham, May 19, 1982. </p> <p><strong> Child care in crisis</strong> <br><em>Relations between social workers and client families were were as fraught in the early 1980s as they are now, as the Guardian's David Hencke discovered. </em></p> <p> About 120 children are taken into care by social services in England and Wales each day.

But an increasing number of social services directors are adopting a much tougher line. </p> <p>Spurred on by complaints of inaction, child abuse, wilful neglect and past condemnation by Department of Health and independent inquiries, they often act to break up the family. </p> <p>John Rea Price, director of the London borough of Islington's social care department, put it this way: \"Too many decisions have happened because social workers took non-decisions ... trying to keep families together when it might have been better to make a clean break. Social services is a risk business. We may even sometimes take a wrong decision because we are never certain how things will turn out. </p> <p>\"If one of our decisions unfortunately led to a mother who lost her child throwing herself off the top of a tower block, at least we could say she wasn't carrying the child at the same time.\" </p> <p>It is this sort of strong-mindedness that is bringing a strong reaction ... Some clients [are] unhappy at the way their cases were handled. One woman summed up the lack of communication: \"Social workers - they come to lecture us about our kids. But have you seen their homes? There they all are sitting on bean bags on floorboards, bringing their kids up on vegetarian muck - which the kids hate - then they have the cheek to come round and tell us our carpets are dirty.\" <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> David Hencke, November 3, 1983. </p> <p><strong> My mad, glad, upside down world</strong> <br><em>Bob Holman left academic life to become a community worker on a Glasgow housing estate in 1976. This is his account, in Society Tomorrow in 1986, of the first 10 years. He retired earlier this year. </em></p> <p> As a social scientist, I operated from a top-down perspective. Academics analyse social problems and then try to convince politicians of the steps to improve services. This approach has two flaws. Mixing with the establishment may bring prestige, but it doesn't seem to help the socially deprived very much. </p> <p>Instead, the outcome often seems to be the expenditure of much public money on large buildings and larger salaries for people who already have jobs with, at best, just marginal gains for the poor. Further, the top-down view may not be accurate because its conveyors have separated themselves from the very people in whose interests they claim to speak. </p> <p>Ten years ago, I left a university chair to start a small community project on a council estate. Now I know there is a view from the underside. </p> <p>A friend has had his children removed permanently because he ill-treated them. It is easy for outsiders to condemn him and to recommend regulations and registers for child abusers. But my wife and I stood by him in an almost empty church as he watched the mother of his kids marry another man. I watched his knuckles turn white as he gripped the pew. Rejected, poverty-stricken, he tried to cope with the children. He went to pieces and resorted to drugs. </p> <p>From the underside, I know that he needed money, support and respect. </p> <p>Soon after I moved in, the three Labour councillors called. \"We know what you'll do,\" one declared. \"Stay a year, write a book, and go.\" The remark had the barb of truth, for professional careers - my own included - can be arranged as a series of short stays, each of which is used as a step to higher status and social advancement. </p> <p>Ten years later, I know there is something to be said for staying. </p> <p>Twice a week, I visit a pensioner still shaken by the death of his wife. He worries about the price of coal. He has exchanged his colour television for a black and white one. I can't do much for him, but he gets upset if I don't call. That means staying. But the staying is also the happiness. </p> <p>A few weeks ago, a young boy said: \"Bob, we've been talking about you in the street and we're all going to come to your funeral.\" I hope it is not an immediate prophesy. But at least he thinks I'll still be in this neighbourhood when I die. I hope so. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Bob Holman, March 26, 1986. </p> <p><strong> Big Brother's invisible ball and chain</strong> <br><em>The soaring prison population in the 1980s generated interest in alternatives to jail. We reported the arrival of a US solution - electronic tagging. </em></p> <p> Tomorrow's world of electronic incarceration has arrived. One by one, at a session at the recent American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago, the inventors and the marketing chiefs proudly displayed their wares. </p> <p>David J Hunter, president and chief executive of BI Inc, was there promoting a device trademarked as the BI Home Escort, which at the moment is detaining hundreds of prisoners in their own homes in Michigan. </p> <p>The \"electronic shackle\" is a uniquely encoded, tamper-proof radio beacon fitted to the offender's ankle. It communicates with a receiver fitted in his home. Wearing the anklet, the offender can play football with his children, wash the dishes, watch TV, take a bath. But if he strays more than 150 feet from the receiver, off go the alarm bells in a justice department control centre. </p> <p>The device has a bizarre genesis. The idea occurred to Judge Jack Love, of Albuquerque, who took it from a Spiderman comic and then pursued it when a number of petty offenders locked up in the New Mexico state penitentiary were killed in a prison riot; it seemed improper to him that, in effect, they had received the death sentence for minor crimes. </p> <p>Officialdom endorsed the idea because of the appaling overcrowding in American prisons: in January, Texas released 200 felons because it had nowhere to put them; in Louisiana, the gaolers resolved the problem only by shoving the prisoners into tents in the prison yard. Then there is the money. Prisons cost about $125,000 per prisoner to build and $95 per day per prisoner to run. Electronic home arrest costs $10 a day, and clears the prisons of the embezzler, the drunken driver and the salmon poacher to make room for the arsonist, the rapist and the killer. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Tim Radford, April 1, 1987. </p> <p><strong> I've got Aids</strong> <br><em>As the emergence of Aids triggered a sexual health panic in the second half of the 1980s, we ran occasional extracts from the diary of Chris Dale. In this excerpt, Dale tells his family he is HIV positive. </em></p> <p> \"So, what's this thing you've got?\" asked my father late in the evening. The moment had arrived; I could avoid it no longer. </p> <p>\"Well, actually, Dad, I've not told you everything so far. You see, the reason there's been such a problem shifting this Isospora is that I'm partially immune suppressed.\" </p> <p>\"What does that mean?\" </p> <p>\"I'm HIV positive. Do you know what that means?\" </p> <p>\"No.\" </p> <p>\"It means I've been exposed to the Aids virus and have developed antibodies.\" </p> <p>\"You've got Aids?\" </p> <p>\"No. It doesn't mean I've got Aids. However, it does mean that my resistance to infection has been lowered. And I could get Aids in the future - no one knows. Your heart attack was a signal: change your diet and lifestyle or suffer the consequences. I've now been given a similar warning: look after my health or run the risk of developing full-blown Aids.\" </p> <p>\"For God's sake, don't tell Mum. It'll kill her.\" The reaction was the same as three years previously when I'd first told him I was gay, the feeling again that ignorance was less upsetting than knowledge. </p> <p>The conversation dribbled on. When had I caught it? Did William have it? How had he caught it? I lied here a little. William and I had decided from the start that nothing could be gained by trying to calculate who'd infected the other. But now, to protect William, I claimed that I had contracted the infection before meeting him and had subsequently infected him. Whilst Dad was out with the dog, Mum came and asked me how I felt. I started the conversation as I had with my father, but as soon as the word \"Aids\" came up, she walked away, saying: \"I don't want to know any more; I don't want to talk about it.\" <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Chris Dale (pseudonym), June 3, 1987.</p>",
  "<p>This weekend John Bunting will go for a ramble on a hillside near Buxton and will literally dance in the Derbyshire heather with his wife Irene. It will be, he says, one of the most momentous days in a very long life, a celebration of a struggle to allow ordinary people to walk responsibly on land that has been forbidden to them for centuries. The old legs will have a spring in them, the heart will lift and, he says, he might sing a song too. </p> <p>Bunting, 87, is one of the oldest active campaigners for the \"freedom to roam\", which comes into legal effect in the Peak District and the north-west on Saturday. Four years after Labour kept its promise, and the then environment minister Michael Meacher finally steered a watered down version of the original Countryside and Rights of Way Act through parliament, the Ordnance Survey maps for the Peak District have been redrawn, the landowners have mostly accepted the changes, hundreds of new gates and signposts are in place and 100,000 acres of the national park and surrounding areas will be legally open for everyone to walk over, within certain limits. Over the next year, an area the size of Devon will become available to all. </p> <p>Bunting has been fighting for open access to Britain's moors for 70 years, but the campaign goes back much further, to the time of the enclosures in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and the emergence of the diggers and levellers and the Labour movement itself. The first bill trying to wrest access to the land back from the landowners was put before parliament in 1884 and presented every year until 1916. Each year it failed. </p> <p>Bunting joined the movement as a footsoldier in 1932, aged 14, in the same year as the famous trespass on Kinder Scout by hundreds of people led by Benny Rothman. </p> <p>\"I started going out to the moors from the time I began working in a Sheffield steelworks. The only time we ever saw the sun was at weekends and in the holiday shutdowns. We so looked forward to getting away from the smoke and the noise. We'd put our bikes over the wall and start walking. Most young people went cycling or walking or fishing. We'd go to the hills and when we came back, all we'd see was a big black pall [of pollution] over Sheffield,\" Bunting recalls. </p> <p>\"I didn't trespass to start with, but I went to my first great access rally at Castleton in 1932. They were all political. The speakers were always Labour MPs and socialists. I remember Barbara Castle and Herbert Morrison talking. We were fighting for national parks by then. We thought if we got those we would get access to the moors, too. We were conned.\" </p> <p>The Peak District moors, on the doorstep of so many northern towns, were a breeding ground for political and social ideas, popular with individual rambling groups, socialists and communists, and youth movements such as the Woodcraft Folk and others. Not everyone trespassed, most preferring to try to work out access agreements with landowners. </p> <p>\"But a lot of us used to trespass individually. It just wasn't right, was it?,\" says Bunting. \"We could never see why all this land should be closed to us just so they could shoot for a few days of the year. They pinched it off us in the first place, didn't they? So we just went out and climbed. We knew we could run faster than the gamekeepers. </p> <p>\"During the war I was in the Home Guard and we used to spend weekends on the moors at firing ranges,\" says Bunting. \"After the war, it was the gamekeepers who had the guns and we were the enemy. Funny that.\" </p> <p>Bunting sat on various access committees after the war and got to know the people who had led the access movement, including GHB Ward, Benny Rothman, Tom Stevenson, Basil Rawson and Bill Keane. The national parks were formed, but scandalously did not give people more rights of access, and, says Bunting, the issue went quiet until the early 1980s when the Ramblers' Association, by then a unified body, got behind the issue. </p> <p>After the 50th anniversary of the Kinder Scout trespasses in 1982, Bunting and like-minded others in Sheffield founded Scam - the Sheffield Campaign for Access to Moorland - one of several direct action groups that worked strategically with the Ramblers' Association to keep the issue on the political agenda and press for legislation. </p> <p>\"The freedom to roam has its roots in the northern working class movement - people like John Bunting who spent Monday to Saturday in pretty horrible conditions,\" explains Nick Barrett, chief executive of the Ramblers' Association. \"Come Sunday, surrounded by some of the most beautiful land in the world, what's more natural than to get out? But they found the land barred to them. It raised the question of who the land belonged to.\" </p> <p>The first world war was the key moment in what could be the longest environment campaign in English social history. \"People came back from the war and here was serious social change. You had the rise of the Labour and communist movements; of women and trade unions; you had the demand for the vote; the depression years. We would not have got this legislation without successive generations saying, 'This is not right. Why can't we go for a walk in our own county?'\" </p> <p>The freedom to roam, as expressed and fought for by the likes of Bunting, is the root of today's environment and conservation movements, says Barrett. \"Underpinning the desire to have the freedom to roam is the concept that if you can physically enjoy something, then you would wish to conserve it. That's why we have a conservation and environment movement. This is probably the last great piece of old Labour legislation.\" </p> <p><strong>Q&amp;A: walking back to happiness</strong></p> <p><strong> What does the new law say?</strong> </p> <p>It will allow walkers to explore away from paths on approximately 4m acres of mountain, moor, heath, down and common land in England and Wales. </p> <p> <strong> Can people go anywhere?</strong> </p> <p>It does not allow people to walk through back gardens or over crops. </p> <p><strong> What can I do on access land?</strong> </p> <p>The law provides a right of access for walkers only. It does not confer any additional rights for cyclists or horse-riders. Dogs are permitted on some areas of open country, but must be kept on a lead on access land between March 1 and July 31, and at any time in the vicinity of livestock. Access at night is permitted, but may be subject to local restrictions. </p> <p><strong> What restrictions are there?</strong> </p> <p>No lighting of fires, using metal detectors, bathing in non-tidal waters, playing organised games or camping, hang-gliding without the permission of the landowner. </p> <p><strong> What happens to walkers who behave irresponsibly?</strong> </p> <p>Anyone who breaks a restriction can be barred from entering the land for the next 72 hours. </p> <p><strong> Will landowners be able to close their land for any reason?</strong> </p> <p>Yes, for up to 28 days a year for any reason. </p> <p><strong> What is open this wekend?</strong> </p> <p>The whole of the Peak District national park, parts of Derbyshire, Staffordshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, all of Greater Manchester and Cheshire, along with Merseyside, most of Lancashire, a small part of Cumbria, and part of North Yorkshire. Places such as Snailsden Moor, Bradfield Moor and Axe Edge Moor, great expanses of moorland, that have been out of bounds for the outward bound for more than 100 years, will be accessible to people on foot. Also areas in the south-east of England. </p> <p>* Other regions will be opened up between December 2004 and November 2005. In Wales, access becomes a reality in the summer of 2005.</p>",
  "<p>Commissions of inquiry into this or that can often be disappointing affairs, especially when they lack official authority. But the independent commission on the future of the voluntary sector in England, which reported in 1996, has come to be seen as a model of its kind. Much of what it proposed has already come to pass and the sector now stands on the brink of legislative reform that could prove a historic legacy. </p> <p>\"We had no status at all,\" recalls Nicholas Deakin, who chaired the commission set up by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. \"We paraded round the country and people came and talked to us. It was an act, in a way, of enormous arrogance to expect that people would respond to us, but they did.\" </p> <p>Those were the dying days of Conservative rule and it is easy, in retrospect, to think that change was in the air and the commission was playing sweet music to an appreciative Labour gallery. Not so, insists Deakin. After four straight Tory general election victories, he and his colleagues were counting no unhatched political chickens: the commission went out of its way to write a report directed as much at the then government as at Tony Blair's opposition. Besides, Labour had proved itself to be no great friend. </p> <p>\"When I was a voluntary sector regional chair in the Midlands in the 1980s, the bane of my life was Labour councils that would have nothing to do with voluntary sector bodies, which they associated with Tory ladies in flowery hats and that sort of stuff,\" Deakin says. </p> <p>\"The Tories were almost equally patronising - you know, 'our little helper'. 'We can entrust you with various things; we'll contract with you to make sure you deliver [public services]; but come near us to talk about policy - not a chance.'\" </p> <p>In the event, and very much in that caricature, Conservative ministers rejected the commission's call for government action to improve its relations with the voluntary sector while endorsing what was said about the need for change in the sector itself. \"That was extremely helpful, because it sort of severed us from the Tories,\" says Deakin. By contrast, Labour's then spokesman on the sector, Alun Michael, committed his party to the whole package. </p> <p>In fact, Deakin and Michael had been meeting from time to time during the commission's year-long work. Deakin is a self-effacing sort - he volunteers, for instance, that he was not first choice to lead the inquiry - but undoubtedly his experience played a key role in preparing the ground so fruitfully for the voluntary sector. For while he was at the time professor of social policy and administration at Birmingham University, and was best known for his academic work on the inner cities and race, he had been a Whitehall civil servant and had led the central policy unit at the former Greater London Council. </p> <p>Now in his late 60s, Deakin retires at the end of this month from his last academic post as visiting professor at the centre for civil society at the London School of Economics. It would be a fitting postscript to his career if the draft charities bill were to become law, reforming the legal and regulatory regimes for charities very much in the way the commission envisaged. But he is very worried that it will not. </p> <p>The problem is the confusion over the \"public benefit\" test at the heart of the bill and, specifically, whether it could trump case law in respect of existing charities charging high fees, such as private schools and hospitals. Despite an agreement unveiled in the past few days, by which the charity commission accepts that case law would not prevent the test being applied to schools, Deakin is unconvinced that the issue is settled. </p> <p>The agreement, he says, \"seems too much like a hasty fudge instead of a consistent approach that sets a clear framework\". He thinks there should be a clear definition of public benefit on the face of the bill, making a proper base for modern charity law that brings about substantive change, rather than merely repeating what already exists in common law. </p> <p>\"People like me who have been on the fringes of it get terribly impatient with charity law and the way in which the framework just doesn't fit the interests of all those involved - except charity lawyers,\" he says. \"I don't think the charity commission is obfuscating and this is a genuine difficulty - going retrospectively into the credentials of all those very powerful organisations really is a wasps' nest - but, for God's sake, it ought to be soluble.\" </p> <p>Until, and unless, there is legislation, the biggest single change associated with Deakin's commission is the \"compact\" between the government and the voluntary sector and the mini versions at local level. This approach was forged against a background in the 1980s of what he describes as \"extreme anxiety\" about the contract culture, and what it was doing to the voluntary ethos, as the Tory government sought to use charities to deliver policy programmes that Labour councils were boycotting. Anxiety remains, and Deakin stresses that charities entering contracts need their wits about them, but he gives the compact seven out of 10 for what it has done to build a better, two-way relationship. </p> <p>\"Reciprocity is crucial and the government has delivered on that impressively,\" he says, though adding that full delivery had to wait until Labour had got over its initial dirigiste phase of suffocating central control. \"Senior voluntary sector figures are now familiar faces around the Whitehall corridors. It may not be down to the compact as a document, but it is down to the atmosphere that the compact symbolises.\" </p> <p>Another key recommendation of the 1996 commission - and one that Deakin, writing in Society Guardian at the time, described as being the most ambitious - was to promote the role of voluntary action in rebuilding civic culture. To Deakin's delight, this is a theme picked up recently by David Blunkett, the home secretary, and Deakin is serving on a steering group looking into the idea of an active citizenship centre. \"In many respects it's an agenda I'm very happy with,\" he says. \"It exactly reflects the concerns we had eight years ago about the value of voluntary action, not just in an instrumental way, a service delivery way, but in creating a new civil consciousness.\" </p> <p>The downside for Deakin is the association of this agenda with what he calls the home secretary's \"extremely negative\" messages on refugees and asylum seekers, public safety and crime. He worries also that, in cabinet terms, it appears to be one person's agenda and therefore acutely vulnerable to a reshuffle. \"But we compromise, don't we? It might continue; it may be that this is important enough in terms of New Labour priorities and should not be doubted.\" </p> <p>Would compromise be acceptable to save the charities bill? \"What I don't like is the idea of having got it all set up, and properly prepared, and then to be wasting this once-in-a-generation opportunity,\" says Deakin. \"That's what's getting me in all this. </p> <p>\"Would a sort of half-cocked bill be better than nothing? I don't know ... It's intensely frustrating.\" </p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong> Age</strong> 68 </p> <p><strong> Status</strong> Married, one son and two daughters by previous marriage. </p> <p><strong> Lives</strong> East Finchley, north London. </p> <p><strong> Education</strong> Westminster school, London; Milton Academy, Massachusetts; Christ Church College, Oxford (MA in modern history); University of Sussex (PhD). </p> <p><strong> Career</strong> 1959-63: assistant principal, Home Office; 1963-68: assistant director, Nuffield Foundation survey of race relations; 1968-72: fellow and lecturer, University of Sussex; 1972-80: head of social studies and then central policy unit, Greater London Council; 1980-98: professor of social policy and administration, University of Birmingham; 1998-2001: visiting professor, Warwick business school; 1998-present: visiting professor, London School of Economics. </p> <p><strong> Interests </strong> Music (has just started piano lessons).</p>",
  "<p>Albert Einstein's take on the laws of mathematics could have been penned to describe the process of pre-legislative scrutiny that has kept the draft charities bill in the news in recent weeks. \"As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality,\" Einstein wrote, \"they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\" </p> <p>The furious debate about what the bill can and cannot do, what the Charity Commission will and won't do, the robust language of the parliamentary scrutiny committee and the Guardian's coverage have ensured that certainty and reality are very far from this debate. </p> <p>Now that the scrutiny committee has finished its proceedings, it is essential that all those involved take a step back and consider what we wish to achieve. How can we ensure that this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to redefine charitable activity in Britain is not lost because of too much heated debate and not enough cold-headed analysis? </p> <p>In 1996, Nicholas Deakin and his commission's far-sighted report set a series of clear policy objectives that it believed would put the third sector at the heart of our society with a modern legal and fiscal framework. It included proposals that, if implemented, would ensure that voluntary and community organisations were open, accountable and delivering the highest standards. </p> <p>The government and the sector have worked closely together to implement this agenda. Deakin has seen his recommendations gradually being acted upon - from new tax reliefs, to quality standards. The last remaining major recommendation of the commission to be implemented is its belief that public benefit should be at the heart of charity law. </p> <p>At first glance, this seems a relatively simple thing to do. But it has taken us nearly six years, a sector-led commission, two government reports, several consultations, a parliamentary scrutiny committee, the ongoing campaigning of more than 40 charities and the support of thousands more just to get us here. And still it seems these changes are at risk. </p> <p>But why such complexity? There is evidence that society does not have a clear view on what is and is not charitable. There is public support for using \"public benefit\" as a measure by which to judge charities. There is overwhelming backing for the changes within the voluntary sector. </p> <p>This is what we must not forget among all the discussions about the detail of the bill. These reforms need to happen; they must not be lost. </p> <p>The scrutiny committee has injected a rigorous analysis into this debate that has ensured we are discussing the key issues. I genuinely believe this gives us an opportunity to be absolutely clear about what we want from this new act. If it does one thing, it must ensure that every charity, existing or new, can demonstrate now and in the future that it operates in the public benefit. </p> <p>Nobody is opposed to this - the government accepts it, the independent schools have welcomed it, the charity lawyers think it will work, and charities have campaigned for it. The recent statement by the Charity Commission as to how it will test public benefit is helpful, but we need guarantees from ministers that charitable status will continue to be given on the basis of what a charity is for, not what it does. </p> <p>This bill is central to the way society wishes to be viewed. Opinion polls tell us we want more from our lives. We want to do more for ourselves and for others. By redefining charity as a concept that all can understand, and by promoting this to encourage more people to take part, we can begin to provide some of the answers sought. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Stuart Etherington is chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations.</p>",
  "<p>Security was stepped up around Buckingham Palace yesterday after the embarrassing lapse that allowed a protester dressed as Batman to storm the building. </p> <p>Extra armed officers were posted in the palace courtyard and two uniformed constables stood guard at the corner where Fathers4Justice activist Jason Hatch propped the ladder that allowed him to clamber on to the building. </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, said he would not shy away from sacking those in charge of royal security if it turned out they had failed in their duty, while the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, was scrutinising a report of how Mr Hatch managed to get within a few metres of the royal balcony. </p> <p>The activist was released from police custody yesterday, on bail but without charge. The Met said he had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage - understood to be of pigeon netting he disturbed as he moved across a ledge - but well-placed prosecution sources said there was a good chance he would not be charged. </p> <p>One said: \"The lawyers will have a very close look at the incident but it may be judged that it will not be in the public interest to take Mr Hatch to court. For one thing, it would simply give him another high-profile platform.\" </p> <p>Commander Peter Loughborough, the head of the royalty protection group, and Brigadier Jeffrey Cook, the royal security coordinator appointed after the comedian Aaron Barschak gatecrashed Prince William's 21st birthday party, are at the centre of the palace security inquiry. </p> <p>Speaking at the Police Superintendents' Association conference in Warwickshire, Mr Blunkett said: \"I'm prepared for heads to roll if the head is of the person responsible for failing to do their duty.\" </p> <p>But he also hinted at tension between the police and royal family over security. </p> <p>\"When you are dealing with the security of the royal family, the royal family does have a hand in who works alongside the police on the ground,\" he said. \"I respect that but it does mean there is shared responsibility.\" </p> <p>The report, which the commissioner had demanded be on his desk first thing yesterday, is understood to confirm that alarms and CCTV cameras, installed at the palace after the September 11 attacks in the US, had worked effectively. </p> <p>But it is understood to accept that the defences at the point where Mr Hatch propped his ladder were weak. Mr Hatch and his accomplice, Dave Pyke, who was dressed as Batman's sidekick, Robin, had only to step over a metre-high fence to get to the palace walls. </p> <p>The police and royal family will have to decide whether to introduce stronger security measures to keep the public further back from the palace, as happens at Downing Street. </p> <p>The royals - and Mr Blunkett - are known to be against the idea of creating a \"sterile area\". </p> <p>Meanwhile Mr Hatch, 32, walked free from Charing Cross police station on bail yesterday afternoon. Mr Pyke, 48, was arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting a criminal offence. </p> <p>When Crown Prosecution Service lawyers examined Mr Barschak's Windsor Castle incident, lawyers considered bringing charges ranging from burglary to assault - he planted a kiss on the prince - but it was thought none would stand up in court. Trespass is a civil rather than criminal offence. </p> <p>The Batman case may increase pressure on the government to introduce a criminal offence of \"royal trespass\" to stop intruders invading royal property. </p> <p>Less than 24 hours after he allowed himself to be lowered from his precarious perch, Mr Hatch, who claims he is denied access to two of his children, was back in front of the palace giving a press conference. </p> <p>Clearly emotional, he said: \"The government has made activists of loving fathers. It was easier to get to the Queen's balcony than it is to see my own children.\" </p> <p>He admitted he had been frightened when an officer pointed a gun at him. But he said: \"I focused on my children - a picture in my mind of my children - and just kept going.\"</p>",
  "<p>He risked his life, his liberty and his reputation to perch for five hours on a ledge at Buckingham Palace dressed as Batman. It was all, he said, to highlight the injustice of not being allowed proper contact with his two young children from a previous marriage. </p> <p>As Jason Hatch walked out of a police cell yesterday it was surprising, then, to find his current girlfriend complaining that his commitment to protesting for fathers' rights meant he had little time for their seven-month-old daughter - the youngest of his four children by three different women. </p> <p>Gemma Polson, 27, suggested the strain on her relationship with Mr Hatch from his activities was so great that the couple had separated. </p> <p>\"We're not together anymore. It was all going too far,\" she said. \"Fathers4Justice has taken over his life. He was seeing hardly anything of our daughter which was a bit rich when the whole point of his campaign was to allow dads to see more of their children. I'd just rather he saw more of Amelia.\" </p> <p>Ms Polson said she knew nothing of his plan to scale Buckingham Palace, which was plotted at a country hotel last Saturday night by leading members of the group. \"He had told me he was going to give it all up, but then he goes and does that.\" </p> <p>But she indicated that the couple's separation was not final. </p> <p>\"We are still friends,\" she said. \"I spoke to him on the phone this morning, he was in hospital being treated. I'm waiting for a call from him right now. He's just been released from the police station.\" </p> <p>She said she did not want to comment further until she had considered offers to sell her story to a national newspaper. She added, however, that she was no longer living at the home the couple shared in Cheltenham. The modern semi-detached house is just a few hundred yards away from where two of Mr Hatch's children - the subject of his protests - live with their mother Victoria Jones. </p> <p>Ms Jones took refuge with her mother from the intense publicity in the aftermath of Mr Hatch's protest. A notice posted on the door of her mother's house yesterday stated the family were \"law-abiding citizens\". </p> <p>Mr Hatch's father, Roger Tunnicliff, said his son only wanted to be a good father to the two children, who are aged four and six. </p> <p>\"It affects me too. I'm missing out on seeing my two grandchildren. When I see Vicky in the street, she won't speak to me. It's very hard. She tells me she is not allowed to speak to me.\" </p> <p>Mr Hatch was released on bail yesterday and immediately returned to Buckingham Palace, telling reporters that \"I would do anything, even die, to get to see my children\". </p> <p>He refused, however, to discuss his seven-month old baby, on the grounds that the subject was a private matter.</p>",
  "<b> David Handley, founder of Farmers For Action and leader of 2000 fuel protests</b> <p> When used in a responsible manner, direct action is a good way of making the government or the public think for the first time about a subject or think in a different way about an issue. </p> <p>But ... it should only be used as a last resort, when all other avenues have been tried and failed. We took action because we believed the government wasn't listening to the farmers. We made them listen. </p> <p>Doing a stunt just for its own sake achieves nothing and you have to make sure people's egos don't get in the way. Good luck to this Batman guy. He's certainly got his message across. </p> <p> <b> The Rev Malcolm Carroll, long-standing Greenpeace activist</b> </p> <p> Of course direct action works. Greenpeace would not invest so much time and effort in such campaigns if it did not. </p> <p>There are pitfalls - if it is a stunt rather than an action then the message is lost. I think direct action is most effective when, for instance, you are heading out in a dinghy to try to save a whale. It is a symbolic act but it is also practical - at least one or two might be saved. </p> <p>The Fathers4Justice action was clearly successful and gave them huge exposure. But it is very difficult to control the message when the media gets hold of a story. </p> <p> <b> Brenda Boughton, 79-year-old peace campaigner who refuses to pay her taxes in full because of defence policies</b> </p> <p> As far as I'm concerned direct action is essential. I don't believe in paying that part of my taxes which I calculate goes on defence spending, so I simply refuse to pay. They take me to court and in the end the Inland Revenue takes the money directly from my bank. </p> <p>I think it's important that more people realise that what I am doing is not an extraordinary thing. If they did follow their consciences more, many other people would do what I do. </p> <p>I think the man who dressed up as Batman and risked his life must have felt he had no choice. </p> <p> <b> Andrew Rigby, professor of peace studies at Coventry University</b> </p> <p> Those who take part in direct action have [to ask themselves] how they can justify it in a liberal democracy. What gives them the right when there are legitimate ways to get themselves heard? The answer, of course, is that they have lost faith in the legal process. </p> <p>However, I think the Fathers4Justice campaign was particularly effective because of the Batman outfit. You couldn't help but laugh - and think all was well with the world after all. </p> <p> <b> Mark Borkowski, head of PR firm that specialises in celebrity stunts</b> </p> <p> The history of direct action is a proud one, taking in the likes of Peter Tatchell, Greenpeace and Swampy. Many feature very brave individuals - think of those campaigners on a tiny inflatable heading out to tackle a huge tanker or whaler. </p> <p>It does work. The bottom line is that we are talking about the Fathers4Justice stunt. I think fathers' rights is an issue the media hasn't taken seriously enough and what these people have done is get it on the agenda. </p> <p>What you have to do is make sure you have a strong brand and a clear message - and then find something really eyecatching to do, as Batman has done. The catch then is to hang on to the \"Daily Mail vote\". Some, like Swampy and the Greenham Common women, couldn't do that. Keeping direct action going is more difficult. </p> <p> <b> Richard Dodd, a regional director of the Countryside Alliance </b> </p> <p>Last week around 300 of us turned up outside Tony Blair's home in Trimdon Colliery, County Durham. We were shouting and blowing hunting horns ... Word came back that a few of us would be allowed in to speak to him and we had 20 minutes with him, talking about hunting over a cup of tea.

  "<p>The county of Surrey is no longer known for its radicalism. The memory of William Cobbett had already faded by the late nineteenth century as the white settlers of the Empire - the tea, coffee and finance barons of London - decamped to the Surrey hills. Today their legacy lives on amongst the gin and tonics, Jags, and golf clubs. </p> <p>But there does remain a small corner of the county which recalls a more unorthodox past. In Compton, not far from Guildford, lies the former home and studio of the Victorian painter, sculpture and aesthete George Frederick Watts and his wife Mary Watts. And this year marks both the centenary of Watts' death as well as the opening of the Watts Gallery on this site.</p> <p>Watts was one of the most celebrated artists of the Victorian era whose life intersected with the great cultural moments of the nineteenth century. He was a friend of Tennyson and Carlyle, a collaborator with Julia Margaret Cameron, an inspiration to the pre-Raphaelites, one of the great portrait painters of the time, and arguably a pioneer of early twentieth century Symbolism.</p> <p>Born in London in 1817, the son of an unemployed piano maker, Watts was apprenticed at a young age into the capital's art world. He worked initially for the artist William Behnes while some of his early drawings were shown to the President of the Royal Academy, Sir Martin Archer-Shee, who promptly declared to Watts' father: \"I can see no reason why your son should take up the profession of art.\" </p> <p>Undeterred, it was at the RA in 1837 that Watts first made a splash with his picture of fragile destruction, The Wounded Heron. Watts went on to enter the competition to decorate the new Houses of Parliament and won one of the \u00a3300 prizes for his picture of Caractacus, a captive British chieftain being led through the streets of Rome. </p> <p>With the winnings, Watts followed the Victorian fashion by heading off to Italy. In Florence, under the generous patronage of the British minister and his wife, Lord and Lady Holland, he fell in love with the Italian aesthetic. Drawn as much to the culture of public art - the frescoes and civic adornments - as the brilliance of such artists as Michaelangelo, Watts gained a lofty, Renaissance conception of the artist's function. He returned to Britain determined to revive great and noble art - even, \"raising art to the level it attained in the great days of Greece.\"</p> <p>But what greeted Watts on his arrival back in Britain was the terrible social detritus of the 'hungry forties.' In a series of social realist paintings - Found Drowned, The Irish Famine (which is a masterful update of the flight to Egypt), The Song of the Shirt, and Under a Dry Arch - Watts depicted the awful urban underbelly of industrialisation. Today, these pictures of poverty, hopelessness, and destitution hang together in the Watts Gallery as a reality check on his later flights of allegorical fancy.</p> <p>Partly because of their bleak subject matter, the 1840s pictures were not successful, and Watts had to retreat back to portrait painting for income. Watts was always in two minds about portraits. On the one hand, he thought nothing was more unworthy yet financially necessary than a portrait. As one of his biographers puts it: \"Again and again his noble nature ... made him foreswear portraiture for ever. Again and again he was obliged, in order to pay for tomorrow's breakfast, or canvas and paints ... to return to what seemed to him a prostitution of his gifts.\" </p> <p>On the other hand, Watts' abiding sense of duty drew him towards portraiture as a form of public service - as a way of capturing for posterity the great men and women who defined an age. His friend and admirer, Alfred Lord Tennyson, described Watts' genius in the lines:</p> <p>As when a painter, poring on a face, Divinely though all hindrance finds the man Behind it, and so paints him that his face, The shape and colour of a mind and life, Lives for his children, ever at its best.</p> <p>And Watts was certainly a master of the genre. Some of his finest portraits - John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle, William Morris - now reside in the National Portrait Gallery. Typically, Carlyle was appalled by his representation: \"Decidedly the most insufferable picture that has yet been made of me, a delirious looking mountebank full of violence, awkwardness, atrocity and stupidity ... the fault of Watts is a passionate pursuit of strength.\" </p> <p>It was this strength and grandeur which produced the art which ultimately made Watts' name. During the latter half of the nineteenth century, Watts turned his attention towards more allegorical works with a series of powerful studies inspired by classical mythology. Orpheus and Eurydice, Pygmalion, and ceaseless meditations on love, life and death all made their appearances. </p> <p>Perhaps his most famous production of this period was Hope (1886) which depicted a blind, toga-clad nymph perched on a globe studiously thrumming the one remaining string to her battered, collapsing lyre. Such was the comfort afforded to the afflicted by this picture that prints were handed out to the Egyptian troops after their defeat in the 1967 Israeli-Egyptian war. </p> <p>Watts' The Minotaur (1885), now in the Tate collection, which depicts the bovine callousness of a minotaur gently crushing a small bird in its hand, was inspired by W.T. Stead's expos\u00e9 of child prostitution on the streets of London and remains a superbly haunting image of the banality of evil. Watts saw it as his mission as an artist \"to hold up to detestation the bestial and brutal.\" </p> <p>Perhaps Watts himself felt he had extra insight into this topic since for a brief period when aged 46, he was disastrously married to a sixteen-year-old actress. It was quickly annulled. Later in life, at the age of 69, he found happiness in marriage to the 36-year-old Mary Fraser Tytler. </p> <p>Mary Watts came to revere her husband and attempt something of a canonization in her Annals of an Artist's Life. But her great achievement can be found just down the road from the Watts Gallery in the Compton village cemetery. Through the yew and chestnut trees rises a building that could be a Tuscan monastery. Instead this Romanesque chapel is an Arts and Craft wonder, covered in celtic and art nouveau decorations by Mary Watts and others. It is a monument to an altogether different history of Surrey.</p>",
  "The Independent Police Complaints Commission is prioritising an investigation into the arrest and alleged mistreatment of a Muslim student last month by using its own staff to make inquiries. It is only the eighth matter to be examined directly by the group, which replaced the Police Complaints Authority in April. <p>Abdul-Muqtadir Mustaqim was pulled over by Thames Valley police in Milton Keynes on August 23. He will appear before magistrates in the city this morning, charged with possession of a bladed weapon and a public order offence. </p> <p>The 19-year-old law student told the Guardian that officers initially said they had stopped him because they believed his car was not taxed. When he showed them the valid tax disc they questioned him over a series of other matters before searching and arresting him, allegedly manhandling him despite his lack of resistance. </p> <p>Thames Valley police said they welcomed the investigation, but could not comment further on the case.</p>",
  "A man convicted of murdering eight children in a frenzied knife attack at a primary school three years ago was hanged in Osaka yesterday, in Japan's first execution for a year. <p>Mamoru Takuma barged into several classrooms at Ikeda primary school in the city's suburbs in June 2001, slashing children as they sat at their desks. Thirteen other children and two teachers were injured in the attack, which exposed the lax security at many Japanese schools. </p> <p>The sentence on Takuma, 40, was carried out with unusual speed - less than a year after his conviction was finalised - a result, some have suggested, of the widespread public horror at his crimes. </p> <p>But Amnesty International in Japan criticised the execution, saying it had been carried out in secrecy and before the full details of the crimes had been learned. \"This was far too impetuous,\" a statement said. </p> <p>Kaoru Kurata, the mayor of Ikeda, which lies about 250 miles west of Tokyo, welcomed the execution. \"I hope it is of at least a little comfort that the perpetrator has been punished under the law and no longer exists on this earth,\" he said. </p> <p>The father of one of the dead children said in a television interview: \"Takuma has been executed, but that will not bring back my child.\" </p> <p>Sueo Shimazaki, a 59-year-old former mafia boss who killed three other gangsters in 1988, was hanged at another location. </p> <p>As usual, the executions were carried out when parliament was not in session, to avoid awkward questions from MPs opposed to capital punishment. Another favourite time is just before the new year holidays, when few people are interested in the news. </p> <p>Takuma, who had a history of mental illness, initially showed no remorse for the murders, the worst mass killing since the Aum Supreme Truth doomsday cult gassed 12 people to death on the Tokyo subway in March 1995. </p> <p>During his trial, he boasted that he could have killed more children had he attacked a kindergarten. </p> <p>He allegedly started a fight outside a hotel a year before the attacks, and had been arrested two years earlier for lacing colleagues' tea with tranquillisers while working as a primary school caretaker. </p> <p>As of last month, there were 63 prisoners on death row. Unlike Takuma, most will have to wait years before they are executed.</p>",
  "<p>If the early-season storm clouds are lifting from the skies above Mick McCarthy's head, Joe Kinnear must be finding the September air increasingly oppressive. </p> <p>Whereas Sunderland's second win in four days confounded those who were beginning to doubt McCarthy's capabilities, Kinnear's horizon appears bleak. </p> <p>Forest have endured their worst start to a season since 1928 and arrived here with their manager demanding the first league win of the campaign. Such ambitions were dented as early as the fourth minute when Julio Arca emphasised that he has fully recovered from his recent jellyfish sting by shooting Sunderland ahead. </p> <p>Although the Argentinian's low left-foot strike from just inside the area was well executed it was born of Forest's misfortune. As Dean Whitehead crossed the ball from the right for Marcus Stewart to run on to, Jon Hjelde lay injured on the ground, allowing Stewart the space to tap the ball into Arca's path. </p> <p>Some Sunderland fans were disappointed that Whitehead, McCarthy's summer signing from Oxford United, had been selected ahead of Liam Lawrence, but Whitehead vindicated his manager's judgment by swiftly helping create a second home goal, his corner setting up Stephen Wright to head beyond Paul Gerrard. </p> <p>Before Saturday's 4-0 away win at Gillingham Sunderland had been faring almost as badly as Kinnear's side and a group of disgruntled fans had made plans for a protest, which never materialised. Instead the Wearsiders howled for a penalty when Andy Impey sent Stephen Elliott crashing right on the 18-yard line. But a free-kick, subsequently wasted, was awarded inches outside the area and Impey received a yellow rather than a red card. </p> <p>Mart Poom had seen little action but he reacted well to tip a rising Paul Evans snapshot over his bar during a second period which also saw Carl Robinson and Arca unlucky not to extend Sunderland's lead. </p> <p>\"Two wins make a difference,\" said McCarthy. \"Despondency was creeping in but it's lifting now.\" </p> <p>Kinnear spent more than an hour locked in the dressing room with his players and refused to attend the post-match press conference.</p>",
  "<p>Jose Mourinho considers defending a beautiful art. Yet even he would have averted his eyes from this exhibition just a few miles from the Louvre were it not so completely to the benefit of his team. </p> <p>A series of ridiculous defensive errors from Paris St-Germain handed an easy victory to the European champion coach and his charges and few can have enjoyed it more than Didier Drogba. </p> <p>Jeered from the moment his name was announced, the former Marseille striker had cause to laugh after his two goals secured an away victory that already makes Chelsea's progression to the second round look a probability. </p> <p>\"I think when you are away and you have three points, you can control your destiny,\" said Mourinho. \"Even if we have a bad night at home and we don't win, we are already in a good position. Moscow and Porto have drawn and the pressure is on them, not us. </p> <p>\"We now have two consecutive matches at home and if we get the points we will arrive at the end of three matches with one foot in the next round.\" </p> <p>This was as tough an examination of Chelsea's mental resilience as they are likely to meet this season. With the shrill whistles and drums of the home fans splitting the air, it was also a test of character for Joe Cole. </p> <p>Yet there was no reception more intimidating than that which greeted Drogba, whose spell with PSG's arch-rivals Marseille will not be forgiven in Paris. The Ivory Coast international's imperturbability was amply rewarded. </p> <p>\"I think even PSG supporters will see how he performed and admire him,\" said Mourinho. </p> <p>Nor was Drogba put out of his stride by the departure of his strike partner Eidur Gudjohnsen, who was carried off and needed eight stitches after clashing heads with PSG's captain Jos\u00e9 Pierre-Fanfan. Mateja Kezman replaced him and might have opened the scoring with his first touch after being put through by Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 but prodded wide from an acute angle. </p> <p>Meticulous as ever, Mourinho will have been aware of the comic episode that saw confusion between Lionel Letizi and his defenders gift an equalising goal to promoted Saint-Etienne during PSG's last home match. The joke defending was again in evidence in Paris last night. </p> <p>Cole displayed fine close control to deliver a shot which ricocheted behind, off Bernard Mendy. Letizi was then left clutching only his face in shame after he let slip Frank Lampard's corner for John Terry to head unchallenged into an empty net. </p> <p>That was not PSG's greatest crime, though, as the half-time deficit was doubled by an even more comical error. Cole won a midfield duel with Mendy and looked up to see Kezman bisecting the central defenders with an opportunist run. </p> <p>Perhaps Pierre-Fanfan was still concussed after his clash with Gudjohnsen, because his placement and that of his partner Helder left them 10 yards apart, allowing Kezman a free shot at Letizi. The goalkeeper blocked that with his legs but that merely allowed Drogba to pop the rebound into an open net. </p> <p>\"That goal allowed us to control the game,\" said Mourinho. \"We could defend the result by not giving the ball to the opponent.\" </p> <p>He was right. Paris were restricted to long-range efforts by Charles-Edouard Coridon, Lorik Cana and Modeste M'Bami which were never going to trouble Petr Cech. </p> <p>Twice also Cech sank to the floor to deny the Portugal international Pedro Pauleta from 20 yards, with Bartholomew Ogbeche and Helder both heading wide from within the area. However, despite the restricted ambition which can accompany the confidence that a game is safe, it was Chelsea who continued to enjoy the best chances. </p> <p>Six minutes into the second half the ever-industrious Cole, who clearly relished his opportunity to prove himself in such exclusive surroundings, shot over with a rasping effort, then left it too late to pull the trigger after being put through by Lampard. </p> <p>Parisian invitations to extend the lead without expending any great energy continued and it was Drogba, inevitably, who would accept. </p> <p>On 75 minutes Kezman was brought down by Helder on the edge of the area and the \u00a323m striker was quickly standing over the ball with Geremi. A wide gap appeared between Letizi's wall and his unguarded near post, and it was there that Drogba delivered the ball, and the final insult to PSG. </p> <p>\"Allez l'OM,\" said the striker in reference to his former club. But it is Chelsea who are on their way now.</p>",
  "<p>The contrast with last season could hardly have been more pronounced. Though the continent's greatest teams, a group which Arsenal are so desperate to join, are unlikely to be perturbed by reports of this relatively prosaic performance, it has increased the English champions' confidence immeasurably. </p> <p>When Arsenal got their last Champions League campaign under way in this stadium a year ago they were naive and nervy and in the end convincingly beaten by Internazionale. The 3-0 reverse left them fighting for their survival in Europe and it took victory in their final three group matches to carry them out of the group stage. More importantly, the psychological effects continued to be felt, the team considering themselves pretenders in Europe, beaten once and bruised thereafter. </p> <p>\"I'm convinced the players were still feeling the trauma of last season's first game,\" said Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. \"If you play your first game at home your next two are away and if you lose the first game you have to win at least one. That game against Inter was certainly still in our memories tonight, but the players will just feel that they have done their job. We had to win and we have won.\" </p> <p>They did so without showing the style that has proved so stunning domestically and as the second half progressed their slender advantage was increasingly threatened by a disciplined PSV Eindhoven. But though it was not a night without nerves, Arsenal gave their opponents only one opportunity, sliced wide by Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink in the 77th minute. </p> <p>\"I was surprised with the quality of their defensive line and with their intelligence,\" said Wenger of the visitors, currently second in the Dutch league. \"You have to give credit to Eindhoven. They are certainly a much better side than many people expected here.\" </p> <p>Having been forced into some major rebuilding in the summer after three of his first-choice forwards moved to England, Mateja Kezman and Arjen Robben to Chelsea and Dennis Rommedahl to Charlton, Guus Hiddink was rightly proud of his side's efforts. As his South Korea team proved in the last World Cup, Hiddink can be relied upon to instil tactical astuteness and fearsome fitness into his charges and Arsenal were swiftly forced to reconsider the pre-match confidence which saw Jose Antonio Reyes - who received a standing ovation when he left the field towards the end - boast that \"I can't see [PSV] troubling us if we play as we can\". </p> <p>\"We brought in some young players and also some experienced players, and I think so far this mix is doing well,\" Hiddink said. \"They know how to play and they proved it tonight. We were very organised defensively and the second half proved that the team is tactically good. We used the ball well and kept Arsenal under pressure, especially towards the end. We were controlling the game in the second half. There are not that many teams that can frustrate Arsenal to that extent.\" </p> <p>It was, then, a shame that in the first half his players not only failed to control the game, they could not even control their feet. For much of the past year Arsenal's success has been such that opponents have been left wondering what they put in their drinks, but last night the more appropriate question was what they put on their pitch. The first half was peppered with players slipping and sliding across the surface, culminating in a goal which saw visiting defenders fatefully upended at both beginning and end of Thierry Henry's decisive dash from the left wing. Hiddink, when pressed, insisted he thought this was \"a very good pitch\". </p> <p>Arsenal will at least now feel they have a relatively sure footing in Europe, with Rosenborg next to play in two weeks' time and a visit to Panathinaikos thereafter, but despite having a seemingly straightforward group their confidence will be muted. </p> <p>\"We are quite confident wherever we go,\" suggested Wenger, before adding a caveat. \"Everyone makes us super-favourites in this group but you've seen tonight there's not much difference between the sides at this level.\" </p> <p>Hiddink, who guided PSV to victory in the European Cup in 1988, believes that Arsenal will certainly win the group. \"I don't think the other teams have the attitude to play like we played tonight, to frustrate them here,\" he said. If this is as frustrating as the season gets, Wenger for one will certainly be happy.</p>",
  "Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, expressed his \"concern\" last week that Israeli expansion of illegal West Bank colonies threatens the viability of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians welcome such concern, but wonder what the British government intends to do about it. <p>Mr Straw's concern is well-founded. Israeli colonies - illegally built in occupied Palestinian territory and often on land confiscated from Palestinians - have long obstructed a negotiated peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Currently, more than 400,000 settlers inhabit nearly 200 colonies scattered throughout the occupied territories, including east Jerusalem. Integrated into Israel by \"Israeli-only\" roads and electricity grids, the colonies are strategically placed to fragment Palestinian communities, control water resources and frustrate any true exercise of Palestinian nationhood. </p> <p>The erection of Israel's wall, spun as a \"security\" measure, is simply the latest strategy in consolidating Israel's hold over its colonies. Unsurprisingly, the wall is not built on Israel's 1967 pre-occupation border but well within occupied Palestinian territory and in such a way as to maximise the number of Palestinians behind the wall while allowing more than 80% of the settlers to remain. </p> <p>Mr Straw astutely expressed the fear that the colonies would soon detach east Jerusalem from the West Bank. But this detachment has already in effect been realised. Palestinian east Jerusalem has been strangled by the wall and two circles of Israeli colonies. The city has begun to wither: Palestinian schools now lack teachers; churches are in need of priests; and the infirm can no longer get access to clinics or hospitals. As a result, Palestinian east Jerusalem has witnessed an exodus of the indigenous Christian and Muslim population, which Israel does not regret. </p> <p>In July, the international court of justice (ICJ) unanimously reaffirmed that Israel's West Bank colonies and the wall violate international law. Along with the 24 other members of the European Union, Britain endorsed the ICJ's ruling. Nevertheless, the colonies continue to expand. Since the ruling, Israel has authorised the construction of more than 2,300 new housing units in the occupied Palestinian territories. These new units, which are heavily subsidised by the Israeli government, could house more than 8,000 new Jewish settlers from around the world, while local Christian and Muslim Palestinians would be forced into ever-shrinking reservations and ghettoes. </p> <p>As Mr Straw is certainly aware, Israel's colonies are nothing new. And as every Palestinian is aware, international \"concern\" over Israeli colonisation - inevitably followed by non-action and eventual acquiescence - is not new either. During the Oslo process, the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and even the United States condemned Israeli colonisation as illegal or against the interests of peace. During the same years, the number of Israeli settlers living in the colonies doubled. </p> <p>To save the prospect of Israel and Palestine living side by side, in peace and security, the United Kingdom and the EU must hold Israel accountable for its failure to abide by international law. Every pressure, whether economic or diplomatic, must be exerted to encourage Israel to reverse its colonisation policies.</p> <p>The EU's reluctance to take decisive action in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict not only teaches Israel that the EU can be ignored, but also it sullies the laudable values of freedom and the rule of law that the EU seeks to promote. There is an inherent contradiction in supporting the ICJ decision and opposing Israel's illegal colonies, while simultaneously providing Israel with preferential trade relations in the form of the EU-Israel association agreement. By doing nothing to end \"the apartheid regime\" in the Palestinian Territories, which \"is worse than the one that existed in South Africa\" - as described by John Dugard, South African law professor and special rapporteur for the UN on human rights in the Palestinian territories - the EU erodes its international credibility as a non-biased facilitator of peace while placing itself squarely in opposition to democracy, freedom and law enforcement. This is hardly the kind of policy that would induce Ariel Sharon to take the EU seriously. Indeed, he does not. </p> <p>The United States continues to teach Israel that it is above the law - and we have seen the disastrous results. The UK and its EU partners should take a different approach.

The amendment, which reduces the two-year delay to 18 months, will be tabled by the passionately anti-hunting MP Tony Banks, and is being signed by Peter Bradley, Mr Michael's ministerial aide. </p> <p>There were signs last night that anti-hunting Labour MPs, who had demanded that the government drop any delay, will reluctantly support the Banks amendment. This raises the chances of the bill and the amended resolution sailing through the Commons today, allowing the measure to be sent to the Lords tomorrow. </p> <p>Such a scenario would present peers, who overwhelmingly support hunting, with a dilemma. They will in effect be challenged to support the amendment and preserve hunting until July 2006, or oppose the bill and possibly see hunting banned within three months of the bill being passed in November, by the invocation of the Parliament Act, which allows certain bills to be passed into law if they are blocked by the upper house. </p> <p>The move to curtail the two-year delay was proposed by Peter Hain, the Commons leader, who warned ministers during last Thursday's cabinet meeting that the Downing Street plan would be voted down by Labour backbenchers. It is understood that the prime minister was highly sceptical of Mr Hain's proposal because Downing Street is determined to neutralise the political fallout of a ban in the run-up to next spring's expected general election. </p> <p>Mr Hain eventually won round the likes of Mr Banks and David Winnick, another vocal opponent of hunting. He managed to persuade them that although the delay would only be cut to 18 months, it would mean that only one more hunting season could be held. </p> <p>Mr Blair, who is understood to have taken a lot of persuading, was finally won round after it became clear that the delay would be in place until after the last possible date for the general election, which would be the summer of 2006. </p> <p>This will allow the prime minister to court core Labour voters, who are dismayed by the Iraq war, with a clear choice: vote Labour and guarantee a hunting ban, or allow the Tories to win and save the sport. </p> <p>Mr Bradley last night welcomed the change as a reasonable compromise. He said: \"It will deliver the manifesto pledge that we have made. It will allow a reasonable transition period to remove any justification hunt supporters may otherwise claim for the wholescale destruction of packs or for taking the kind of action that might hijack the election should it occur next spring.\" </p> <p>Mr Banks said: \"It is the best we can do under the circumstances. But if the government wants to give the hunts time to phase down, to rehome hounds and take us beyond any last theoretical date for a general election, then this will do it. But I fully expect the government to guarantee that, in the event of the Lords rejecting the amendment, it will not delay the bill or prevent the Parliament Act being used.\" </p> <p>Hunt supporters, who planned a mass protest outside parliament today, complained they were being used as a \"political football\".</p>",
  "Big Brother dropped in on the genteel spa town of Harrogate yesterday, with a mixture of chaos and cosiness which would have deflated George Orwell. <p>For almost three hours the Home Office's biometric survey lorry - potentially crucial to a national identity card system - stood empty and forlorn in an Asda car park, surrounded by overturned supermarket trolleys to keep shoppers' cars away. </p> <p>Two of its crew sheltered from the drizzle in a car while a third wrestled morosely with a hired generator, coils of wire and a satellite dish. </p> <p>\"It's a very complicated technical operation, bear with us,\" said HQ in London, where data from 10,000 volunteer card-testers is gradually being fed into David Blunkett's ID security system, complete with James Bond gizmos such as iris-scanning. </p> <p>It was these which set Harrogate alight yesterday, once all the glitches had been sorted and the sun came out (allowing the lorry to demonstrate its mechanical awning, which worked first time). </p> <p>A group of pensioners was first in line to have a go at the three \"unique personal\" identification tests - iris pattern, facial recognition and hi-tech, colour-screen fingerprinting - which may be part of national security's future. </p> <p>\"I saw that the lorry was coming here on the TV last night and I thought what a great idea,\" Theresia Rawley said, looking forward cheerfully to having her eyes photographed by a machine with a tinny, digitalised American woman's voice. \"It's got to be better than having to take your blooming gas bills along when they want proof of identity at the bank or wherever. What's the fuss about identity cards? I was born in Germany, they've had them there all my lifetime and nobody gives it a thought.\" </p> <p>Another volunteer - the government still needs 1,500 - had followed the lorry from its original, proposed site outside Harrogate register office, which was advertised in the local papers. In another homely hiccough, there was no room to park it there, but the woman had tracked it down to Asda in proper 007 style. </p> <p>\"I'm all for this sort of thing,\" she said. \"If you're not doing anything wrong, who cares who's watching you. Look in Asda, they've got a notice saying that there's electronic tagging and CCTV to make sure we don't have to pay more because of shoplifting.\" </p> <p>The survey welcomed everyone over 18 years of age yesterday, including the Guardian, despite an earlier attempt by a BBC reporter to catch it out by having two goes under different names. My fingerprints were compared by satellite in a matter of seconds with some 1,000,000 records, including a temporary library of biometric volunteers, which spotted the BBC fake. </p> <p>The biometric tests, as well as the lorry roadshow, are the early stage in a possible move to ID cards and \"clever\" passports. Run by the UK Passport Office, the scheme aims to check the practicality of the tests, generator problems and all, public reaction and the most popular of the three identification systems. </p> <p>The government promises all data collected will be destroyed at the end of the survey. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Details of the trial and volunteering are on <a href=\"http://www.passport.gov.uk\">www.passport.gov.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.identitycards.gov.uk\">www.identitycards.gov.uk</a>.</p>",
  "There are two ways of looking at today's efforts to drive the hunting bill through the Commons in a single sitting. The first sees today's votes as the historic culmination of a bitter battle, lasting more than seven years, in which supporters of hunting have finally run out of tactics with which to frustrate the clear will of MPs for a ban on the hateful practice of hunting with hounds. Now at last, according to this view, the government has agreed to face down the bill's opponents by using the Parliament Act to enforce the Commons view. Supporters of the bill are unapologetic: a ban is right in principle, they say, it is the will of the people, the will of MPs, and the government cannot allow the resistance to continue. <p>The second sees tonight's votes in a wholly different light. Where the bill's supporters see only the chance to end a barbaric cruelty, its opponents see a majoritarian, largely urban, onslaught against a minority rural activity which they insist is useful, enjoyable and vernacular. Hunting's supporters feel misunderstood and persecuted. They believe theirs is a fight for freedom. Today's proceedings, they believe, are proof of government weakness not strength, are disproportionate to the activity they seek to control, and are proof both of the government's ignorance of rural matters and of its essential intolerance. Having lost the argument, they charge, the government has reverted to a fundamentally inappropriate form of legislative bullying. </p> <p>Most people, we suspect, sympathise with aspects of both positions and would be content to see some sort of compromise. Hunting's essential cruelty is impossible to dispute. But so is the importance of a minority's freedom to pursue its traditions as far as possible. Compromise, though, has not found many takers in this grinding confrontation; today's unedifying processes are the price to be paid for that failure. There is, though, a slight consolation. This second- or third-rank issue has been too near the top of the political agenda for too long. If MPs can finally settle it tonight, then at least the political stage will at last be cleared for more important business.</p>"
