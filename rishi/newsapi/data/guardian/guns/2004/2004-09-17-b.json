  "The rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, yesterday pulled out of a planned visit to the countryside this weekend, after police warnings that he could be confronted by hundreds of pro-hunting activists. <p>The Countryside Alliance had threatened to mount big demonstrations on Sunday if Mr Michael joined walkers celebrating the introduction of right-to-roam laws. </p> <p>The minister said he had \"reluctantly\" abandoned his plans to visit the Forest of Blowand in Lancashire and the Peak District's Goyt Valley. </p> <p>He added: \"According to police intelligence, my presence has attracted large numbers of protesters who oppose a ban on hunting and seek to hijack an unrelated event simply to gain publicity for their cause. It would be deeply regrettable if protesters targeting me individually ... detracted in any way from those celebrations.\" </p> <p>His announcement came as the chairman of the Countryside Alliance, John Jackson, condemned pro-hunt supporters who invaded parliament and blocked motorways and spelled out what he regards as acceptable forms of protest. </p> <p>Mr Jackson, who also chairs the law firm Mishcon de Reya, described the invasion of the Commons as \"completely wrong\" and the invaders as \"selfish and self-indulgent\". </p> <p>Mr Jackson said that while he believed that \"breaking the law is wrong\", it was also the case that \"eminent civil rights leaders have asserted over many years the moral right of the private person to draw attention to unfairness by breaking the law imposing it, providing they do not harm or unreasonably inconvenience their fellow citizens by so do ing and provided further they pay their debt to society by submitting themselves for trial and punishment\". He told the Guardian that it was important for those who challenged the law to do so openly and then accept whatever punishment resulted. </p> <p>Those who had invaded parliament, he said, had not followed those guidelines: \"I think it was a serious affront to everyone who believes in parliamentary democracy.\" </p> <p>He also thought it was \"very unfair\" to the thousands of people who had demonstrated peacefully. Those who had blocked motorways and roads, he said, were \"foolish\". </p> <p>The issue of civil disobedience, which has been discussed within the pro-hunting movement for the last two years, is now at the top of its agenda. It has already led to disagreement between those who favour such actions as the invasion of parliament and similar stunts and those who feel that such acts will alienate the middle ground. </p> <p>Some pro-hunters have vowed to break the law in many ways to draw attention to their campaign. </p> <p>Mr Jackson foresees dangers in the possibility of mass civil disobedience. He is basing his hopes for hunting on the legal challenge being mounted against the government's use of the Parliament Act to push through the anti-hunting legislationregardless of the House of Lords' opposition. </p> <p>He described the political strategy of Mr Michael as \"absolutely appalling\". </p> <p>Mr Jackson is a member of the Fabian Society and part-owner of History Today magazine. Born in Devon in 1929, he is an expert on Himalayan plants and the author of a book on self-sufficiency, A Little Piece of England. </p> <p>Almost two years ago, in an article in the Guardian, he set out his position on the breaking of the law by his fellow hunt supporters. </p> <p>\"The Countryside Alliance would never recommend its members, or others, to engage in civil disobedience by breaking the law,\" he wrote then. \"It would say that it regarded the matter as one for the individual conscience, and endorse the thinking of Henry David Thoreau in his essay On the Duty of Civil Disobedience published in 1849.\" </p> <p>Thoreau's argument, which was often quoted by abolitionists opposing slavery in the United States before the civil war, was that there was a higher moral imperative than the law itself, which could justify disobedience to the law if it was shown to be manifestly unjust.</p>",
  "The days of illegal flyposters bringing news of music, plays and political demonstrations to the streets of Britain could be numbered after a court yesterday issued anti-social behaviour orders against three of the industry's executives. <p>In the first case of its kind, three staff of the \"ambient\" marketing company Diabolical Liberties were made the subject of interim orders following an application by Camden council in north London. An application for an order against a fourth employee was turned down. </p> <p>It means that the three, including the managing director, Tim Horrox, risk jail if they are found in future to have involved themselves in flyposting in that borough. </p> <p>While local authorities argue that flyposting is corporate vandalism and an urban blight, human rights groups argue that it is a vibrant and historic part of freedom of expression. Many artists and entrepreneurs fear banning the posters could damage counterculture, music and politics. </p> <p>Theatres and other entertainers have flyposted for centuries. But Highbury Corner magistrates, in north London, heard that Camden considered the practice of flyposting to be detrimental and a cause of harassment in the borough. </p> <p>District judge James Henderson was shown letters from local residents testifying to the discomfort the posters had caused them. The council claims it spends \u00a3250,000 each year cleaning up illegal flyposting, and has appointed a \"boulevard manager\" to remove the posters and track down the culprits. </p> <p>It has successfully used the threat of Asbos to make the music giants Sony and BMG stop flyposting in the borough. </p> <p>Before the case, there were warnings that stopping what is sometimes the only affordable publicity for small arts organisations and alternative groups could sound the death knell for independent theatres, alternative viewpoints and street culture. </p> <p>Roland Muldoon, the artistic director of the Hackney Empire, has said that his venue would not exist without flyposting. \"This decision being pushed forward in Camden is terrible for theatre and arts venues because more councils will follow. Small venues will lose the lifeblood of affordable publicity.\" </p> <p>Liberty, the civil rights group, has also voiced fears that using Asbos to tackle flyposting could affect political diversity and freedom of expression. </p> <p>Malcolm McLaren, former manager of the Sex Pistols, has spoken out against banning the posters on aesthetic grounds. </p> <p>Diabolical Liberties has turned an illegal counterculture into a lucrative business, employing 100 people and having a turnover of \u00a310m. </p> <p>Lawyers for Mr Horrox, James Heighway, Dominic Murphy and the fourth employee, Anna McAfee, argued that the interim order should not be issued because they said the council failed to follow the correct procedures. </p> <p>They claimed that the council had failed to consult and to liaise with the police as required by law. </p> <p>The judge refused an application against Ms McAfee, but said Camden had presented a prima facie case and was therefore entitled to the interim order against the others. </p> <p>\"There is evidence that flyposting causes harassment and distress for those within the area and that this does amount to anti-social behaviour,\" he said. </p> <p>He also upheld the council's right to hold the four defendants responsible. \"There is evidence that the four before the court to a greater or lesser extent have directed anti-social behaviour.\" </p> <p>A full civil hearing will occur in the next few months. Immediately after the ruling, company representatives said they would appeal. </p> <p>Afterwards John Thane, Camden's executive member for the environment, said: \"This is anti-social behaviour and we don't just chase the men in the little white vans. Flyposting has nothing to do with culture. It has everything to do with money.\" </p> <p>Adrienne Merrill, communications director for Diabolical Liberties, said the Asbos would have a serious effect. \"There are more live venues in Camden than almost anywhere else in the country. It is a terrible shame that Camden don't see cultural ads as relevant to the borough.\"</p>",
  "Now the storms have swept in. Leaves have been whipped from the trees, but not the fruit. Blackberries, damsons and sloes await our picking. This year, the hawthorns have been even more noticeable, with masses of orange-red berries. Rowans are less numerous, but more likely to be dashed down by the wind. <p>Visitors in the area always arrive in Nevern. This is a modest, attractive village with a river, a castle, a church and an inn, whence you may walk up the river to another welcoming hostelry - or down the river for circular walks that take you seawards or into the commercial buzz of Newport. </p> <p>The church can be approached from three directions, all of which lead to an avenue of old English yew trees, one of which seems to shed blood. For comparison, there is a row of younger Irish yews. The graveyard has a powerful Celtic stone in it. </p> <p>The history of the church holds the usual, uncertain detail of stones that wander off, imposed Victorian improvements and all the muddle of human history. But there is another church, St Andrew's, Bayvil, which was long associated with Nevern. Owned by the Friends of Friendless Churches, it is well worth a visit. </p> <p>The church is obscured by vigorous bracken, kept in check by careful paths mown around the building. From the entrance, you look down to Newport Bay and Dinas Head, and over to Carn Ingli. Inside, there is a Jane Austen church, with a complete set of box pews, so arranged that you can see the high painted and panelled pulpit. Four simple windows and no electricity; it is a place of great peace.</p>",
  "<p>British American Tobacco is attempting to play down its potential liability in the run-up to a $280bn (\u00a3150bn) claim against the US tobacco industry due to reach court in Washington next week. </p> <p>BAT, which this year saw its American business spun off, Brown &amp; Williamson, is one of a handful of multinational tobacco groups named extensively in the claim brought by the US government. </p> <p>B&amp;W and BAT Investments, a British scientific research subsidiary of BAT, are defendants. Other include Philip Morris, owner of the Marlboro brand, and RJ Reynolds, which makes Camel cigarettes. </p> <p>Many analysts have suggested that the merger of B&amp;W and RJ Reynolds this year greatly reduced BAT's exposure to the lawsuit. BAT, which makes Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and Dunhill cigarettes, retains a 42% holding in the merged US business, Reynolds American. </p> <p>\"Reynolds American has provided an indemnity for any liability that may arise for B&amp;W under this case,\" BAT said in a pre-trial press statement. \"BAT's liability through B&amp;W, therefore, has now been removed.\" </p> <p>Pressed on this point, a spokesman conceded the federal government might seek damages from BAT in the event of an award that exhausts Reynolds American's ability to pay. \"It is a matter of huge legal conjecture what would happen.\" </p> <p>Despite attempts to play down the litigation risks, BAT bonds have come under increased pressure as the trial nears - though not as much as bonds issued by Altria, Philip Morris's parent company, which were hit hard by a recent report on the suit from credit rating agency Moody's. </p> <p>The trial, which will be heard by district judge Gladys Kessler, is expected to last six months. The US justice department will deploy legislation designed to combat organised crime, claiming that over half a century a handful of tobacco firms conspired to deceive smokers about the health risks associated with the cigarettes they manufactured and marketed. </p> <p>The defendants are variously accused of intentionally marketing to underage smokers; secretly funding research projects they hoped would cast doubt on health risk conclusions; making misleading claims about \"light\" cigarettes; disputing what they knew to be risks associated with second-hand smoking; and destroying documents to cover up their actions. </p> <p>The justice department has traced the alleged conspiracy to a meeting at the Plaza Hotel in New York in 1953 between several tobacco company chief executives and the public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton. </p> <p>Months later, the industry published a Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers in 448 newspapers across America. It said there was insufficient evidence to conclude that smoking was the cause of any disease. </p> <p>In a document filed with the court, the justice department alleges: \"Once they had organised and set in motion the essential strategy of generating 'controversy' surrounding the scientific findings linking smoking to disease, defendants stuck to this approach ... for the next half-century.\"</p>",
  "<p>The odds of Lord Kirkham taking <strong> DFS</strong> private dramatically narrowed yesterday amid talk that hedge funds supportive of his offer of 455p a share for the furniture retail group had acquired 17% of its stock. </p> <p>In a last-ditch attempt to persuade shareholders to back his buyout proposal, Lord Kirkham increased his offer for a third and final time last week. However, the shares continued to trade at a chunky discount to the offer price as several institutions - including Morley - vowed not to back the bid. </p> <p>That discount dramatically narrowed yesterday amid talk that a hedge fund had picked up 18m shares. </p> <p>The rumour was backed by a stock exchange filing which showed the sale of 18m shares by three institutions - Newton, New Star and Jupiter Asset Management. </p> <p>The fact that Newton was one of the sellers was seen as highly significant by sector watchers. Not only is Newton the company's biggest share holder but it has held shares since the company floated. </p> <p>Traders reckon hedge funds supportive of Kirkham's bid now control 50% of the company. That should be enough to give the DFS boss the backing he requires to take the company private. </p> <p>Shareholders are due to vote on the offer at an extraordinary meeting a week on Monday. As Lord Kirkham already owns 10% of DFS, his offer needs to be approved by 75% of the company's remaining shareholders. The shares closed 15p higher at 451.25p. </p> <p>In the wider market, leading shares closed at their highest level for two years, boosted by a firm opening to the day on Wall Street and a good showing from the mining sector, which shot higher on hopes that commodity prices will remain robust. </p> <p>The final scores showed the <strong> FTSE 100</strong> ahead 34.5 points at 4,591. Over the course of the week, the index gained 1%. Traders said the advance had also been helped by the expiry of the FTSE 100 index futures and options contracts. </p> <p>The <strong> FTSE 250</strong> climbed 37 points to 6,296.1, while the <strong> FTSE Small Cap</strong> index gained 6.3 points to 2,574.4. </p> <p>In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 100.69, yielding 4.91%. </p> <p>Medical devices company <strong> Smith &amp; Nephew</strong> was among the session's top performers yesterday. Its shares have been under pressure this week, rocked by spurious rumours that a profits warning could be in the pipeline. However, they bounced back 16p to 496p yesterday as Cazenove, the com pany's joint broker, repeated its \"outperform\" recommendation in the wake of strong figures from American rival Biomet overnight. </p> <p> <strong> Hilton</strong>, the hotel and Ladbrokes betting group, was also in demand, climbing 9.5p to 282.5p. Once again, Cazenove triggered the rise by lifting its recommendation on the stock to outperform. </p> <p>Analyst Nigel Hicks believes the City may have underestimated the potential boost to earnings that a disposal of low-returning hotel assets and a subsequent share buyback could trigger. </p> <p>In addition to that, Mr Hicks points out that the Hilton share price has not moved since the company posted forecast-busting half-year profits at the end of August. </p> <p>Elsewhere, <strong> Reckitt Benckiser</strong>, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group, bounced back from Thursday's hammering. It shares gained 10p to \u00a314.32 as Merrill Lynch restarted coverage with a buy recommendation. Dealers said this was not the sort of thing a big, blue-chip broker would do if - as rumoured on Thursday - there was a profits warning in the pipeline. </p> <p>For the record, the American broker reckons any weakness triggered by the cessation of Reckitt's share buyback programme this month should be used as an opportu nity to pick up stock. \"With the company converting in excess of 100% of operating and net profit into cash, the group is in a position to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders,\" it said. </p> <p> <strong> Cable &amp; Wireless</strong>, which fell 3p to 107p, however, managed to buck the firm market trend after Investec Securities downgraded it in the wake of Thursday's broadband presentation. </p> <p>Although the company made no comments on trading, Investec analyst Christian Maher believes margins at C&amp;W are coming under pressure because the company has been pricing its services extremely aggressively. </p> <p>Hedge fund manager <strong> Man Group</strong> also closed lower after one of the company's brokers, CSFB, downgraded its earnings forecasts, citing the poor performance of Man's AHL, RMF and Glenwood funds. </p> <p>On Thursday, Man Group's other broker, Merrill Lynch, cut its earnings forecasts for exactly the same reason. </p> <p>Man Group enters its closed period ahead of its half-year results at the end of the month. The shares fell 5p to \u00a313.39 yesterday. </p> <p>Away from the blue chips, <strong> Group Four Securicor</strong> firmed 0.5p to 117.75p - despite talk that next week's half-year figures from the firm could be accompanied by a warning that 2005 profits will fall short of City expectations. </p> <p>Finally, keep an eye on <strong> Connaught</strong>, the property services company. Although closing unchanged at 485p, there was an above average turnover of 119,000 shares. Traders said this was sparked by talk that the company is likely to issue a very negative statement next week. Connaught was recently awarded a \u00a3100m contract to refurbish 8,000 council houses in Hackney, east London.</p> <p><strong>Food for thought</strong></p> <p>Flushed with success after the 110p-a-share approach for Big Food Group was confirmed, City speculators were looking for new takeover targets yesterday. They settled on Warner Chilcott, the women's healthcare specialist, and SSL International, the Durex condoms group. </p> <p>Both companies are no strangers to takeover speculation. SSL held takeover talks with Reckitt Benckiser last year, while Warner, or Galen Holdings as it was then called, almost tied the knot with Barr Laboratories. </p> <p>Yesterday's rumours centred on a 330p-a-share approach for SSL and an 800p offer for Warner. Of the two, traders said a bid for SSL was more likely to emerge given that a rival could strip out \u00a3100m of costs. SSL rose 11p to 299.25p, while Warner gained 17p to 648p.</p>",
  "<p>Dale Vince seems very much at home eating brown rice and lentils in his local Stroud wholefood cafe. Wearing a patterned Indian cotton shirt, blue jeans and sandals, his conversation covers organic farming, alternative energy and Michael Moore. </p> <p>Predictable, perhaps, for a Norfolk-born boy who spent 10 years as a new age traveller living in the back of old trucks and buses. But more surprising for a man who is now managing director of a power and distribution utility - especially one who has just picked up an OBE from Buckingham Palace.</p> <p> Vince is one of the new generation of green entrepreneurs who have moved from fringes to mainstream in doublequick time. His Ecotricity company claims to be the biggest independent wind business, albeit still a minnow compared with the likes of Scottish and Southern Energy or United Utilities. </p> <p>But Ecotricity punches above its weight because Vince has a seat on the government's renewables advisory board and has been involved in some very high profile energy schemes. He has just won a new contract to build six turbines for the Co-operative Financial Services to power a quarter of its premises and has provided power for Ford's large Dagenham site in east London. </p> <p>Soft-spoken and vegan he may be, but this new-style utility boss is considered a tough negotiator and is far from a passive participant in a booming, but still cutthroat, sector. </p> <p><strong>Goodwill</strong></p> <p>Vince believes the green energy business is in danger of losing the goodwill of customers because of the way some of the large utilities have been acting. \"There is a big scam going on here with big and small power companies jumping on the bandwagon. They are often charging customers a premium for renewable energy from plants built years ago,\" he says.</p> <p>The difference with Ecotricity is that it promises to use the bulk of the income it gets from new customers to build turbines - and then give them all their energy from that renewable capacity. </p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, Ecotricity does not even want to provide new customers with 100% green energy from the start - although it can offer that. Instead it asks people to wait. Cutting CO2 emissions and saving the planet from global warming will only come about if new capacity is built, argues the company. </p> <p>Ecotricity is spending \u00a37m this year - half its turnover - on new turbines. In 2005, it will double its capacity again but admits if it won a million customers tomorrow it would not be able to cope. </p> <p>Although Ecotricity likes to be seen as the greenest of green, it still faces some of the same irritating obstacles as those encountered by larger rivals - like planning delays. Vince is pretty angry about that. \"You can't be in wind without having problems with planning. On-shore schemes are in the hands of local councillors, who don't read the details of applications, don't understand government policies and cave in to local pressure groups,\" he argues. </p> <p>Ecotricity wants the government to hand over control to county councils so that projects are pushed ahead faster. </p> <p>Once again he blames the big power companies for some of the objections to wind power by choosing inappropriate locations and building on a massive scale. \"We only deal in small projects of two to three turbines and ensure the local community are comfortable with the scheme. This is very different from those trying to build huge wind farms in sensitive areas.</p> <p>\" So what does he make of Tony Blair's speech this week when he championed the cause of renewables by warning in the strongest terms about climate change? </p> <p>\"It was a great thing to hear such a positive statement but I worry that he mentioned solar, wave and offshore wind power, none of which are here [producing] now. The one thing he did not talk about was onshore wind, which even the Department of Trade and Industry accepts is the one that will deliver government targets. If he is afraid to speak about it because it might upset folk in the country - rather like fox-hunting - then that's not a good sign.\" </p> <p>Vince says he is proud of his growing company. Ecotricity employs just 40 staff but it has developed a growing network of 5,000 customers and supplies electricity to the Body Shop and Sainsbury's. As well as operating seven wind parks and developing an eighth for the new Co-op deal, Ecotricity also builds renewable energy equipment and claims to be Britain's biggest exporter of wind masts. </p> <p>He is particularly pleased to be trusted by big name clients like Ford. But is there not something ironic about a devotee of renewables helping one of the world's biggest producers of climate-destroying cars bring even more into the world? Not at all, he says. \"It's better that we provide power than some traditional source, and, anyway, Bill Ford [the new chairman] is a strong believer in the need to fight global warming. He is doing a lot when it comes to producing a new generation of more planet-friendly vehicles.\" </p> <p>However, Vince is not willing to help everyone who comes to see him. \"I was asked to work for McDonald's - green them up - but drew the line at that point, given I am a vegan and have got very strong views about food,\" he says. </p> <p>The Ecotricity man has clearly mellowed in other ways since he left school at 15 with nine O-levels but no desire to pursue any normal route to jobs and money. \"I did not want the career and mortgage I felt were being forced down my throat by the system... I quit towns and houses to live in a series of buses, trucks and benders in Britain and Europe.\" </p> <p><strong>Burgeoning</strong></p> <p>He spent some of this life as a peace campaigner, occupying the Molesworth air base in Cambridgeshire, and at one Glastonbury festival he rigged up a windpower telephone for fellow revellers. </p> <p>He claims to have gone from one man band to burgeoning electricity supplier on the back of \u00a31,000 worth of savings. His big break was to build his own wind monitoring tower and then find Scottish Power wanted \"a shedload\". Recently he has funded turbine expansion with the help of Dutch-based ethical bank Triodos. </p> <p>In 1995, he launched the Renewable Energy Company - since renamed Ecotricity - and by 2000, he had won a Queen's Award for Enterprise. It took endless determination and big battles with planners, grid companies and even the National Trust, he says. </p> <p>Paul Monaghan, the Co-op executive who agreed the deal with Ecotricity said nobody should underestimate him: \"He's not a hippy when it comes to a deal. He's as hard-nosed as any businessman.\" </p> <p>Still, Vince appears to be mildy self-conscious about his move from bender to the smart barn where he now lives and is anxious to emphasise he still lives without the \"electronic heroin\" of television. </p> <p>The secret of his success, he says, is a commitment to self-reliance, another principle from the early days. \"From the start, everything I needed I had to build myself - but it enabled me to live with so little money. Most of us spend an awful lot of time working, in order to pay other people to do things for us. I reversed that trend. I built trucks, lived in scrapyards, got paid in parts, learned how to weld.\" </p> <p>He went on to teach himself everything from book-keeping to general business practice. In the early days, he dressed in collar and tie, fearing that he would be excluded from traditional sources of financing and regulatory approval if he was seen as \"an old hippy\". Now he is more relaxed, or perhaps engaging in clever marketing. </p> <p>So what did the boss of Ecotricity wear to meet the Queen? \"A black collarless shirt and jacket. I thought it might be disrespectful to turn up in my normal gear.\" </p> <p>\"I messed up anyway. We were told only to speak if spoken to and address her as 'ma'am'.

  "The French agriculture ministry has infuriated animal welfare organisations by defending that bastion of Gallic culinary culture, foie gras, rather than bow to the demands of Brussels. <p>The ministry yesterday gave the country's 6,000 producers an extra five years - until 2010 - to scrap the cramped individual cages, known as \u00e9pinettes, to which geese and ducks are confined at the end of the fattening process, arguing that a European ruling on the subject was just a recommendation, not a directive. </p> <p>\"It's shameful,\" said a spokeswoman for the French Animal Rights League. </p> <p>\"France has ratified all these conventions on cruelty to animals, and even put most of them into national law, yet it continues to condone this barbaric practice. It seems foie gras is sacred.\" </p> <p>The battle over France's most emblematic delicacy has been raging since 1998, when the Council of Europe, under pressure from countries like the UK, Germany, Sweden and Denmark, where ethics tend to outweigh considerations of mere gastronomy, issued a directive stating that no animal should be \"provided with food or liquid in a manner ... which may cause unnecessary suffering or injury\". </p> <p>The council and many other European bodies, up to and including the commission, have since made many more rulings and recommendations, all of which - if they were ever observed - would end the force-feeding of ducks and geese for foie gras. </p> <p>One states that animals should be fed \"a wholesome diet appropriate to their species, in sufficient quantity to maintain them in good health.\" Another says that ducks and geese, if kept in cages, should be able to \"stand normally, turn without difficulty, flap their wings, preen, perform social interactions and feed and drink normally\". They can do none of these at present. </p> <p>But foie gras is big business in France, which accounts for 70% of the 20,000-odd tonnes produced in the world each year and for 85% of global consumption. The industry, centred in the south-west, employs 30,000 people directly and indirectly, and the average French person eats foie gras at least 10 times a year. </p> <p>To make the nation's favourite entr\u00e9e, farmers push a 25cm (10in) tube down the neck of each bird and pour in 450g (1lb) of corn two or three times a day for up to a month. By the time they are slaughtered, they are suffering from acute liver disease (the organ swells from five to 10 times its normal size), diarrhoea, panting, walking difficulties, lesions and inflammations </p> <p>The foie gras lobby has, of course, fought back fiercely. Recently a committee of eminent scientists from the National Veterinary School and the State Agricultural Research Institute produced an 80-page report claiming the birds cannot be being cruelly treated because they are neither ill, over-stressed or even over-fed. </p> <p>One team found that once force-feeding is stopped, the birds' livers return to normal within a month and their organs shows no lasting damage. A second denied the birds' diet was excessive, citing cases of farmyard geese capable of voluntarily eating up to 600g of corn at a single sitting, while a third measured their stress levels and found they were far more frightened by any passing stranger than by the farmer who came to feed them. </p> <p>But pressure is mounting inexorably on France if not to halt the production of foie gras outright - which even the most committed animal rights activist recognises is not very likely soon - then at least to improve the conditions in which the birds are housed and fed. </p> <p>\"We will implement the recommendation on individual cages, but we need more time and we're glad the government has recognised that,\" said Marie-Pierre P\u00e9 of the industry association Cifog. \"Bigger cages will make it harder to grab the birds. </p> <p>\"Feeding them will take 20-30% longer. That will cost us money.\" The agriculture ministry declined all comment on its decision.</p>",

Utterly captivating. </p> <p> <strong> Carry On Matron</strong> (Gerald Thomas, 1972) <br>4.35pm, C4 </p> <p>The Carry On team are back in hospital for the fourth time, and still managing to raise laughs with terminally ill jokes about bedpans, contraception and the eternal battle of wills between well-starched nursing staff and men in stripey pyjamas. </p> <p> <strong> James And The Giant Peach</strong> (Henry Selick, 1996) <br>5.45pm, Five </p> <p>It is a peach too, with Selick giving free rein to a typically macabre and marvellous Roald Dahl fantasy. It starts in \"real life\" with little James (Paul Terry) given a bag of something magic by old Pete Postlethwaite; soon he's tipped into an animated world - a weird mix of stop-motion and computer generated effects. Top class Disney. </p> <p> <strong> Along Came A Spider</strong> (Lee Tamahori, 2001) <br>9pm, C4 </p> <p>Morgan Freeman reprises his character from Kiss The Girls (and, bar the name, pretty much every role he's played since Seven) as detecto-shrink Alex Cross, on the trail of yet another psychopath who has kidnapped a senator's daughter. It's efficiently done, with Tamahori hitting all the requisite suspense buttons. But with Freeman exuding wisdom and dignity while pretty secret service agent Monica Potter looks on admiringly, you can't help feeling you've seen it all before. </p> <p> <strong> Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo</strong> (Mike Mitchell, 1999) <br>11.30pm, ITV1 </p> <p>This silly comedy about a fishtank cleaner turned ladies' escort makes the Farrelly brothers look subtle. Rob Schneider stars as Deuce, who looks after a gigolo's aquarium and Malibu flat while he's away: but a domestic disaster leaves him looking for quick cash. TJ the pimp (Eddie Griffin) hatch the answer: he should become a \"man-whore\". There are funny moments, but the succession of supposedly comic dates with women missing limbs, a woman with huge feet, a blind woman and a Tourette's sufferer are pretty dispiriting. </p> <p> <strong> Truly, Madly, Deeply</strong> (Anthony Minghella, 1991) <br>12.15am, C4 </p> <p>This was seen as the British version of Ghost, the 1990 Hollywood tale about a man returning after death to comfort his grieving girlfriend. Minghella's film is less sentimental, more emotionally true, and funnier. He's helped by fine acting - Juliet Stevenson as the bereaved Nina makes you feel her pain in all its choking, runny-nosed misery, while Alan Rickman does a very funny ghostly turn as Jamie, invading her flat with a bunch of fellow late-night ghouls. Tears and laughter, all at once: clever stuff. </p> <p> <strong> Sunday September 19</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Three Amigos</strong> (John Landis, 1986) <br>1.30pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Slapstick western spoof about a less-than-magnificent three. Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short play silent-screen cowboy stars who trot off happily to perform at a Mexican village and discover they have been hired to deal in lead rather than blanks - tackling Alfonso Arau and his fellow bandits. </p> <p> <strong> The Devil's Brigade</strong> (Andrew V McLaglen, 1968) <br>1.45pm, Five </p> <p>William Holden stars as a tough second world war officer welding a bunch of US army cooler kings and crack Canadian soldiers into an unconventional but supremely effective fighting force. We follow the selection, the gruelling training, and the rip-roaring battlefield action. Does this remind you of anything? Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen was a big hit the year before ...</p> <p> <strong> The Hot Rock</strong> (Peter Yates, 1972) <br>4.10pm, Five </p> <p>Inventive, funny, spoof-thriller with Robert Redford and George Segal as outlaw brothers-in-law. The two crooks steal a fabulous diamond from the Brooklyn Museum, mislay it, and cut comic capers trying to retrieve it. <strong> </strong> Yates paces the fast-moving thrills with precision. </p> <p> <strong> Dr Dolittle 2</strong> (Steve Carr, 2001) <br>6.20pm, Five </p> <p>Eddie Murphy returns as the vet who can talk to the animals. He and lawyer wife Kristen Wilson are fighting to save a wilderness area from developers, which mainly involves him becoming a sex counsellor for Archie, the nervous circus bear (voiced by Steve Zahn). Murphy's a lot funnier in the Nutty Professor films, but small children will enjoy it. </p> <p> <strong> Something To Talk About</strong> (Lasse Hallstrom, 1995) <br>8pm, Five </p> <p>A mellow, even anodyne, account of a woman's fight to assert herself. The woman is Julia Roberts, a mum and manager of the family's successful stables, and when she finds her husband, good ol' Dennis Quaid, has been cheating on her she heads home to parents Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands. There's a corny showjumping subplot and most of the sporadic fun comes from Kyra Sedgwick as Roberts' sparky sister. </p> <p> <strong> My Cousin Vinny</strong> (Jonathan Lynn, 1992) <br>10.35pm, C4 </p> <p>Undemanding courtroom comedy with Joe Pesci playing a more lovable rogue than his usual demon mobsters. He is Vinny, a novice New York lawyer riding to the rescue of cousin Ralph Macchio and his pal Mitchell Whitfield, innocents charged with a liquor store murder down in steamy Alabama. Marisa Tomei won a best supporting actress Oscar as Pesci's snappy, argumentative girl. </p> <p> <strong> Monday September 20</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Patriot</strong> (Roland Emmerich, 2000) <br>9pm, Five </p> <p>Here's Mel \"Braveheart\" Gibson taking on the evil English again; this time he's a hero of the French and Indian wars trying to live peacefully in South Carolina in 1776 but dragged into the struggle for independence after his son (Heath Ledger) enlists. Some awesome battles, but it's at heart a simplistic stars and stripes-waver. </p> <p> <strong> Last Resort</strong> (Pawel Pawlikowski, 2000) <br>11.20pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Director Pawlikowski's documentary background shows through in this finely observed tale about the plight of a Russian asylum-seeker in Britain: it's a fictional case, but feels entirely authentic. Dina Korzun's Tanya and her son Artyom (Artyom Strelnikov) arrive at Stansted airport from Moscow and are whisked off to a seaside resort called Stonehaven to live on vouchers and be abused by officials and internet pornographers alike. An angry, compelling and touching film. </p> <p> <strong> Evita</strong> (Alan Parker, 1996) <br>12.20am, BBC1 </p> <p>If you discount the pounding monotony of the Lloyd Webber/ Rice songs then this life of Eva Peron as rock-shlock opera has some magnificent touches. Madonna is a charismatic Evita, first lady of 1940s Argentina: sparky, passionate, committed, and a hell of a singer; Jonathan Pryce is impressive as her husband, the president, and Antonio Banderas an intriguing narrator. </p> <p> <strong> Tuesday September 21</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Stargate</strong> (Roland Emmerich, 1994) <br>10.45pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Like his Independence Day, Emmerich's Stargate is a story of plucky earthlings battling hostile aliens, with the accent on special effects rather than any guiding intelligence. James Spader is a slightly unworldly Egyptologist who opens a \"stargate\" into a distant galaxy, stepping through with Colonel Kurt Russell and his starship troopers. </p> <p> <strong> I Went Down</strong> (Paddy Breathnach, 1997) <br>11.20pm, BBC2 </p> <p>This lively adventure is set in an Ireland where the blarney rolls in waves over a traditional crime-thriller set-up. Brendan Geeson and Peter McDonald are sent by a Dublin gangster to hunt down the man who apparently stole 25 grand from him: it's a picaresque journey through glorious rural Ireland, packed with incident, funny and surprisingly moving. </p> <p> <strong> Wednesday September 22</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Gift Horse</strong> (Compton Bennett, 1952) <br>1.25pm, C4 </p> <p>The gift horse is the Ballantrae, one of a batch of leaky old destroyers acquired by Britain at the start of the war. For Captain Trevor Howard, reinstated after court martial, it's a chance to prove himself, and the old tug doesn't let him down. </p> <p> <strong> The Wedding Singer</strong> (Frank Coraci, 1998) <br>7.25pm, BBC1 </p> <p>It's set in the 1980s, but Coraci's sweetly old-fashioned romantic comedy hails from a more distant past. Since the music on show offers the decade's finest - from Culture Club to Kajagoogoo - it's wise to stick with the plot and the engaging performances: Adam Sandler's wedding singer and Drew Barrymore's waitress, as a pair having to lose unworthy partners before finding each other. </p> <p> <strong> The Pelican Brief</strong> (Alan J Pakula, 1993) <br>9pm, Five </p> <p>Glossy, plot-heavy thriller. Downside is Julia Roberts, none too convincing as a brilliant law student whose conspiracy-theorising on the murders of top judges proves correct. Denzel Washington as the gutsy hack who is her only ally is much more credible. </p> <p> <strong> Final Destination</strong> (James Wong, 2000) <br>10.35pm, BBC1 </p> <p>This jolly, gory horror film pits a traditional bunch of teenagers against the ultimate serial slasher: the grim reaper himself. Devon Sawa plays 17-year-old Alex, who along with his high school chums misses the flight to Paris. When the plane explodes, they think they've cheated death, but it seems it's Death who feels cheated, and comes to collect them. </p> <p> <strong> My Son The Fanatic</strong> (Udayan Prasad, 1997) <br>11.20pm, BBC2 </p> <p>Scripted by Hanif Kureishi from his own story, this is a touching and insightful account of a Pakistani cab-driver struggling for acceptance in northern England. Om Puri is pretty wonderful as Parvez, his ambitions bringing him into conflict with his fundamentalist teenage son. Politically astute and intelligent. </p> <p> <strong> Thursday September 23</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Perfect Friday</strong> (Peter Hall, 1970) <br>12.20am, BBC1 </p> <p>A light and sexy caper movie. It stars Stanley Baker in a worm-that-turns role as a dull bank clerk who hatches a daring plan to rob his own bank, with sexy Ursula Andress and her languid aristocratic hubby David Warner for accomplices. Neat, efficient and stylish. </p> <p> <strong> Friday September 24</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Robin And Marian</strong> (Richard Lester, 1976) <br>1.15pm, C4 </p> <p>Lester, maker of the chevaliers-rampant Three Musketeers and Four Musketeers, is in more wistful, elegiac mood in this account of the Robin Hood legend. Sean Connery's weary Robin returns from the crusades to confront Robert Shaw's sheriff of Nottingham once more, but despite their heroic final duel, it's Connery's scenes with Audrey Hepburn as a middle-aged Marion that make the magic; Nicol Williamson, too, is a touchingly faithful Little John. </p> <p> <strong> The Grissom Gang</strong> (Robert Aldrich, 1971) <br>1.05am, BBC1 </p> <p>Gruelling thriller about a young heiress kidnapped by a violent, amoral gang in Kansas City, 1931. Kim Darby is the unfortunate woman - though there are no innocents in this cynical tale - while Irene Dailey's Ma Grissom leads the gang, with psychotic son Scott Wilson. A remake of a poor British version of James Hadley Chase's No Orchids For Miss Blandish, it was attacked as debased and depraved by the critics.</p>",
  "<p>By any standards Deadwood is extraordinary. The lives of the characters, a hellish collection of claims jumpers, chancers, real-estate swindlers, gamblers, road agents, opium addicts, saloon girls and sex slaves culled from the local orphanage, are nasty, brutish and short. Everyone in Deadwood is there either to make money or to have money made from them. Taken together, the subject, characters and photography seem to recall an animated canvas by Pieter Bruegel or Hieronymus Bosch. Deadwood is hideously beautiful. </p> <p>American cable network HBO, which commissioned the series, has generated its fair share of controversy in the past. Sex And The City, The Sopranos and Six Feet Under have all managed to challenge, disturb and even outrage with their language and content. However, with Deadwood, a 13-episode western set in the titular South Dakota town at the height of the gold rush, HBO have surpassed themselves. Written by David Milch, the man responsible for Hill Street Blues and the seminal NYPD Blue, Deadwood is shocking even to those of us who have long regarded the mythology of the wild west as mendaciously self-serving and fanciful. </p> <p>The series (now in its second American season) takes one of America's most cherished genres and doesn't so much play with its conventions as turn them inside out. The western is one of those mediums that few have the courage to mess with. Even the revisionist works of Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah and Clint Eastwood ultimately fail to challenge the apple-pie notion of the cowboy as anything other than a rugged individual out to tame America's badlands with a six-shooter and a Bible. </p> <p>There is no shortage of rugged individuals in Deadwood. In fact you might say that rugged individualism is the series' overriding theme. The sun-beaten faces are rugged, the beards and flea-bitten moustaches are rugged and the language is rugged enough to make even the most piratical of sailors blush. Neither does the series lack in biblical exhortations to do good. The difference here is that the Bible is simply another tool used to murder the native population (\"Godless fucking heathens\") and that individualism amounts to nothing more than stomach-churning rapacity. </p> <p>Speaking from his Californian home, Milch, a former professor of English at Yale University, sees no such contradiction. \"I had originally proposed this as a series about Rome at the time of Nero,\" he explains. \"I had this idea about the urban cohorts, which were essentially Rome's city cops. Except that there was no law, nothing really to administer. So you had order without law. I wanted to look at how a society might function under those terms. However, HBO are already working on a series set in ancient Rome so I was asked to think of a different venue to engage with the same themes and I decided to settle upon the western. Rather like Rome, you had a series of historical accidents that created a community that consciously rejected the idea of law, but had its own terrible version of order. So in a certain sense there is a continuity from my previous work, because it seems to me that cops are the instrument of order for whom law is at best an inconvenience.\" </p> <p>Milch chose the setting of Deadwood because nowhere in the US quite so perfectly embodied the anarchy of America's westward expansion. Set in 1876 just weeks after the battle of Little Big Horn in the Dakota territory initially ceded to the Sioux, the denizens of Deadwood use the discovery of gold and the death of General Custer as a terrific excuse for Lebensraum. Ethnically cleansed of its native population, lawless Deadwood counts on squatters' rights. As Milch puts it: \"Deadwood is an accelerated version of the subjugation and settlement of a whole continent.\" </p> <p>At the centre of all this blood and mud are two characters on a deadly collision course. Al Swearengen, played by Ian McShane, is a monster of primitive accumulation, who owns one saloon and brothel as well as most of Main Street. Down the muddy block, wanting to start a hardware store, is the newly arrived Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant), a handsome but hot-tempered ex-lawman. In the traditional western it would be the marshal turned pioneer whom we would root for and the brothel keeper who would come to a bloody but righteous end. This being written by David Milch, all such notions are quickly forgotten. There is something overbearingly pious, not to say hypocritical, about Bullock's endless Christian hectoring. His first act of \"humanity\", for instance, is to yank the body of a hanging man by the feet to hasten his death. Even the lynch mob look shocked. Al Swearengen, on the other hand, who has a lust for life and a fantastically profane line in insults, has a charm and humour you warm to despite yourself. He is, as one internet fansite puts it, \"the most corrupt, dishonest, vulgar and lovable son of a bitch to ever grace the small screen\". Or, to put it another way, imagine Tony Soprano running a whorehouse in the wild west. </p> <p>\"I kind of wanted people to like, or at least understand, everyone in Deadwood,\" explains Milch. \"Deadwood lacks any kind of social contracts. Without that social contract, freedom is just licence. Essentially, it's fascism, and there is a terrible romance to that. I think that is what is so alluring about characters like Swearengen: he is a strong, charismatic figure, who will permit himself almost anything. He is also a sentimentalist: he will always buy his whores from the orphanage where he was raised.\" </p> <p>Milch is, I suppose, right. Swearengen is a sentimentalist, his murders seemingly committed more in sorrow than in anger. He is the bloke who'll beat you up for slagging off his favourite pub. In this case the pub is the gents' loo and Swearengen, its proprietor, won't hear a word against it. </p> <p>\"Bullock, on the other hand, has a capacity for violence but it's combined with an ethical sense. You may not like him, just as many people do not like cops, but he is the only one anyone can go running to when something goes wrong.\" </p> <p>And in Deadwood almost everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Though all the characters are vivid (particularly memorable are Keith Carradine's utterly menacing Wild Bill Hickok and Robin Weigert's brutal and tragic Calamity Jane), the death count is so high (in the real settlement of Deadwood the murder rate was one a day) by the end of episode four we feel loth to become too attached to any of them. It is this savagely Hardyan fatalism that has offended so many fans of the western genre. And of course the not-so-small matter of the language. There are now internet sites devoted purely to totting up the number of profanities uttered in each episode. What also bewilders even fans of the series is just how British the swearing is. The word \"cunt\", for example, is in the US now the simplest, nastiest and most economically used way to brand a woman a superwhore. In Deadwood, however, the insult is aimed almost exclusively at men and is used in its present-day English sense, meaning superbastard. Milch, perhaps understandably, finds the issue of profanity more than a little absurd. He is monomaniacally devoted to getting things right and spent months researching the speech patterns of the early pioneers. You'd expect nothing less from a man who was recently arrested for driving while writing. </p> <p>\"There have been a great many people complaining that this is not the way people spoke in the wild west, but what they are really saying is that this is not the way people spoke in John Ford movies. Bad language is a form of armour, a way to assert strength and masculinity. Any society that is poor or lawless or violent uses profanity as a way of protection. Go to any inner-city ghetto from Los Angeles to Glasgow and you will find an excess of foul-mouthed men. To pretend that this was not the case in Deadwood, the most lawless and violent outpost of a lawless and violent country, is patently absurd.\" </p> <p>In the real-life city of Deadwood, as in the series, everything from religion to people and the environment is exploited. The town would eventually sit beneath a black cloud of cyanide as its bars pulled in $5,000 a day, and its prostitutes were considered so worthless they were in the words of Milch \"literally fucked to death\". It was, he says, hell on earth. Rarely has hell looked so compelling and terrible. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Deadwood, Tue, 10pm, Sky One</p>",
  "<p><strong>Second Sight </strong><br>Gamecube, Playstation 2, XBOX</p> <p>Hero John Vattic wakes up beaten to a pulp in a dingy prison cell, and his story starts to reveal itself in flashbacks as his slightly geeky earlier self is given a mission to investigate shadowy Russian scientist Grienko's research into telekinesis. Levels alternate between his gun-toting but basically healthy former life and his wild-eyed, physically ravaged, Gulag-dwelling present, in which you're also rapidly reintroduced to your psychic abilities that allow you to heal, attack and become invisible. Benefitting from the fluidity of control and attention to detail that are rapidly becoming the trademarks of British studio Free Radical (also famous for the Time Splitters series), the intuitive interface and immaculately judged aiming and sniping mechanics make it immensely satisfying to play. Along with spookily similar shoot/think-'em-up Psi-Ops, this is third person action at its finest.<br>Codemasters, \u00a340</p> <p> <strong>Juiced </strong><br>PC, Playstation 2, XBOX</p> <p>In a world of pimped rides and car mods, it's unsurprising that game developers have taken to augmenting simple racing games with the ability to make your motor look as though it had been redesigned by a blind drug dealer. Juiced takes this idea very seriously, giving you the chance to customise your car's vinyls, spoilers, ride-height and even neon under-lighting to earn yourself some respect in an underground racing community. Unfortunately, to do this you also have to take part in the game's races, which are not only tortuously long and dull, but also feature some of the most blatant cheating by computer-controlled racers ever seen. You also have to bet on other races, which means waiting until every last straggler has dawdled past the finish: watching a coat of emulsion dry is more stimulating. <br>Acclaim, \u00a340</p> <p><strong> DJ: Decks &amp; FX </strong><br>Playstation 2</p> <p>DJ: Decks &amp; FX sets out to let you mix like a DJ without suffering the intervening decade spent alone in your bedroom forlornly trying to get beats to match on the SL-1200s you borrowed from a friend. And it does it brilliantly, with around 50 variously pounding and melodic house tunes, beats and a cappellas to select and mix together over two decks with a range of digital effects, all of which can then either be recorded or simply played as a never-ending set. Its beautifully elegant and instinctive controls make it possible to mix samples, drum loops and records as though you had grown up wearing one headphone, carrying flight cases and nodding sullenly at the back of nightclub dancefloors.

  "<b>Education</b> <p>This year lies halfway between 2020 and 1988, when Kenneth Baker, the then education secretary, delivered a package of measures that continue to define the modern educational era. In schools alone, the Education Reform Act introduced the national curriculum and testing at seven, 11 and 14; handed control of budgets to headteachers; and invented grant-maintained schools and city technology colleges, the precursors of specialist schools and city academies. </p> <p>Sixteen years on, some of the act's roughest edges have been smoothed, but the educational landscape is more than merely Baker-lite. Since 1988 Whitehall has meddled virtually at will in the content of the curriculum, prescribing huge chunks of the daily school timetables of children across the country. On the other hand, headteachers have become the most influential lobby group in education, as successive Tory and Labour governments pass ever greater power - and responsibility - towards them and away from local councils. And specialist schools have become this government's preferred model for (it believes) raising standards and (it hopes) persuading into the state fold some of the stubborn 7% of parents who continue to send their children to private schools.</p> <p>Maybe somebody - perhaps Gordon Brown if he changes his address by one digit - will abandon specialist schools and the perverse logic of expecting big rural comprehensives to focus on a particular area. </p> <p>But how wide will the changes in education really be by 2020? Heads will still hold the purse strings and local education authorities will probably not even exist. The best guess is that something called, and reminiscent of, the national curriculum will still be in place. Possibly this will be confined to five- to 14-year-olds, especially if trends to greater specialisation and differentiation from 14 on continue. If the government can get a positive consensus on the proposals in Mike Tomlinson's final report, in October, on reform of education of 14- to 19-year-olds, that will become more likely. </p> <p>Fourteen will have replaced 16 as the watershed moment in secondary education, with many more students taking vocational courses. There will be new qualifications to replace GCSEs and A-levels, the exams hardly anyone fails. But students will also take fewer exams: the generation at university now have had the worst of that. But there are almost bound to be complaints in 2020 about the failure to deliver \"parity of esteem\" between work-related and academic learning. There is nothing to suggest industry will deliver the input and enthusiasm to really turn that around.</p> <p>Taking a wider view, it is likely that many children will be taught in classes of 50 or more, with teachers working in teams, with other teachers or groups of classroom assistants. No counter-revolution will be able to obliterate that trend. The status of the teaching profession will still be diminished and the government will not have been able to convince jobseekers that the classroom is the place for them. Most of the best graduates will continue to turn their backs on teaching, to the constant complaints of the (by then) single classroom teachers' union. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Will Woodward is the Guardian's education editor</p> <p><b>Transport</b></p> <p>As they power along eight-lane motorways in their Asian-built electric cars - set to cruise control, naturally - drivers in 2020 will have plenty of time to think about how they will pay their next road-charge bill. A monthly envelope totting up the cost of each car journey will be routine by the end of the next decade if the government's long-term transport plans are anything to go by.</p> <p>Satellite tracking technology will enable the authorities to monitor every car journey - how long it took, how far it was, how fast it was - to calculate a journey charge of up to \u00a31.30 a mile. Driving in many of Britain's cities will require a congestion charge; many motorway journeys will be punctuated by toll booths.</p> <p>The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, wants to begin levying a price for road space. The Conservatives support the idea in principle. But without such a radical change, the future for motorists will be bleak. </p> <p>Wages, wanderlust and globalisation are fuelling a desire to travel. Professor Marcial Echenique of Cambridge University reckons that, by 2021, we will all clock up an extra 1,000 miles a year by road or rail - raising the prospect of rush hours lasting from 5am until midday. \"The congestion will extend, so there will be no period without congestion,\" Prof Echenique warned in a study published earlier this year.</p> <p>Maverick motoring groups who blow up speed cameras will have more to get militant by 2020. A government-funded initiative on trial at Leeds University is examining the possibility of cars having \"intelligent\" accelerators that resist when drivers try to break the speed limit. Traditional speed humps are likely to go in favour of advanced models, which will sink for slower vehicles but stiffen to impede speeders. Many commuter routes will have high-occupancy vehicle lanes for cars with at least two people on board. To help pay their five-figure annual tuition fees, students will be hiring themselves out as passengers.</p> <p>The alternatives to motoring are likely to suffer from familiar problems. Network Rail reckons that by 2015 it can bring punctuality on the railways up from 81% to 91.7%. Says Tony Travers, of the London School of Economics: \"There are some eternal verities about transport policy. One is the maladministration of the railways and the fact that they're forever teetering on the brink of some form of Beeching's axe.\"</p> <p>On the bright side, both east and west coast mainlines ought to have been upgraded by 2020, with superior signalling allowing twice as many trains between London, the north of England and Scotland. But while tilting technology will be commonplace, there is little indication the money will be forthcoming to push speeds beyond the present maximum of 125mph.</p> <p>Commuters in the south-east will benefit from an upgrade to Thameslink and from high-speed local trains through Kent on the Channel tunnel rail link. The East London Line will be extended and joined to other suburban tracks to create an \"inner rail ring road\" around the capital. But only the most devoted optimists can confidently predict that Crossrail, the \u00a310bn east-west link across London, will be built by 2020.</p> <p>Britain's Victorian railway network will never be likely to match its German or Japanese rivals in speed and reliability for long-distance journeys. The disastrous \u00a37.5bn, decade-long struggle to model the west-coast mainline is likely to cast a shadow over rail policy for decades, deterring ambitious state schemes.</p> <p>Aviation could play a much bigger part in domestic transport. In a white paper on aviation last year, the government backed new runways at Stansted, Heathrow, Birmingham and Edinburgh. Government figures say the number of passengers using Britain's airports will leap from 189m to 460m by 2020.</p> <p>Heathrow will no longer be the world's busiest international airport, losing out through lack of space to Paris and Amsterdam. But journeys from Bournemouth to Newcastle or between London and Plymouth could well be on fast, cheap aircraft.</p> <p>Whether a Labour, Conservative or UK Independence party government is in power in 2020, the job of secretary of state for transport will still be a hiding to nothing. The challenges of congestion and pollution will persist. Travellers are likely to have more choice in how they get from A to B and their journeys will probably be safer. But whether moving around will be quicker, cheaper or more reliable than today is deeply doubtful.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Andrew Clark is the Guardian's transport correspondent</p> <p><b>Immigration</b></p> <p>Immigration will feature ever more strongly in daily politics as the 21st century unfolds. In Britain immigration will be seen as an essential component of economic growth and a prerequisite for a healthy economy. But this will not happen in the same way as in the US and Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries, when they built multicultural societies on a positive historical legacy of integrating waves of migrants through the common goal of citizenship.</p> <p>Instead, by 2020 British immigration policy will be founded on the fact of our ageing society. Britain will have fewer people of working age trying to support a growing number of retired people. Britain is likely to encourage immigration on a scale that current levels only hint at, but in the process there is a danger we will develop a two-tier workforce that has more in common with the gastarbeiter economy of the old West Germany than on any American melting pot example.</p> <p>The basis for that prediction lies in the United Nations report Replacement Migration, published in 2000. It estimated that Britain needs to attract a million people a year between now and 2050 to maintain the balance between the workforce and the retired population. That might be regarded as unduly pessimistic, but even the most recent figures from the government actuary suggest that by 2020 there will be 20% more older people than younger adults. </p> <p>The majority of people in their 60s and 70s will be healthy and active; they will demand ever more consumer items and the personal services that go with increased leisure time. There will also be a growing welfare sector to care for the ageing population. The retirement homes of Bournemouth and Eastbourne will become key models for economic regeneration projects across the country. Home Office studies predict this will mean an increase in low-paid, low-skilled jobs that may be difficult to fill from the existing labour force.</p> <p>The pattern is already beginning to emerge in the hospitality and catering industries, where low-wage jobs with little security are increasingly being filled by migrants. The government's role is to ensure they can come here legally and get paid the minimum wage. But for this strategy to succeed longer-term, British governments will have to have come to terms with the flourishing hidden economy of illegal migrants. Otherwise the two-tier workforce will be even more likely. </p> <p>That means that a way to \"regularise\" the position of illegal migrants already in Britain will have to be found. By 2020 it could become a regular feature of British life, with amnesties granted to illegal immigrants before each general election. And if you think that could not happen, look to the US. Earlier this year, President George Bush thought it politic to give three-year work permits and possible citizenship to up to eight million \"undocumented\" workers living mainly in New Mexico and Arizona. His \"compassionate conservative\" move was, of course, really an attempt to capture the increasingly powerful Hispanic vote. Migrants here could soon hold equivalent political power.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor</p> <p><b>Economy</b></p> <p>Forecasting the economy is a mug's game. Who in the aftermath of the three-day week in 1974 would have predicted that by 1990 Britain would be down to a handful of pits and that the National Union of Mineworkers would be shrivelled and beaten? Who in 1984 would have bet that the early brick-like mobile phones would become the fastest-spreading technology in history?</p> <p>On the big assumption that current trends continue, we should expect the UK to become even more dominated by the service sector, the City and the south-east. Europe's wealth is concentrated in a so-called golden banana that runs from northern Italy, through western Germany, eastern France and the Benelux countries and on across the Channel. While Europe's centre of gravity has moved eastward with enlargement, the plains of Lombardy, Bavaria, the Seine basin and the London diaspora will be the continent's unchallenged economic powerhouse for the next two decades at least. </p> <p>As far as the rest of the world is concerned, the big story will be the continued emergence of the three big developing countries - China, Brazil and India. In sheer size, rather than per capita incomes, these countries may soon rank behind only the US. Europe's demographics and its sluggish growth rate mean it will stay rich but be in relative economic decline.</p> <p>That's the easy bit. In reality, things will probably work out differently. The optimistic scenario is that the new wave of inventions over the past couple of decades has pushed the global economy to the cusp of a new golden age. All previous long upswings were based on technological change, and in this view the internet, the mapping of the human genome and robotics are to the coming boom what the car, the plane and the cinema were to the postwar golden age.</p> <p>The pessimistic view is that the future of the global economy is jeopardised by two big threats - one financial, the other environmental. Over the past decade, there has been a rise both in the number of financial crises and in the damage they have caused. With the US awash with personal debt, and running massive trade and budget deficits, the danger is that the next crisis will not be in a developing country like Argentina but at the very heart of the global economy.</p> <p>The other danger is that nobody has worked out what to do if and when the oil runs out. This is an issue that has been ducked by policy makers since the Yom Kippur war in 1973 brought to an end the long postwar boom. </p> <p>So there you have it. You can be an optimist and you can be a pessimist. Or, like me, you can be an optimistic pessimist: things look good in the long term, but there's plenty of choppy water to navigate first.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Larry Elliott is the Guardian's economics editor</p>",
  "Some people look to the future and see the rise of the machines. Others wonder how their machines will ever make them rich. In 1943, for example, the founder of IBM, Thomas Watson, was asked how he viewed the future of technology. His response, it is said, was that there would one day be a worldwide market \"for maybe five computers\". It is not clear whether Watson actually made such a rash statement - and if he did, his apparent lack of vision clearly did his emerging business no harm - but even if the story is untrue, he would surely be astonished at our reliance on his electronic tabulating machines. <p>HG Wells, by contrast, would probably be a little surprised by how backward we are when it comes to getting around. In 1901 he envisaged public transport taking the form of a series of parallel moving walkways, each a little faster than the previous one. Commuters would step from walkway to walkway in order to reach their destinations.</p> <p>Predictions of technological advance have always emphasised the headline-grabbing pipedreams - robot housemaids to lift us out of domestic drudgery, for example - and we still boast of the potential of new developments before we know how to unlock it. Stem cell technology and quantum computers, for example, remain no more than an alluring promise. We can predict everything, after all, except the future.</p> <p>The sticking point in technological development is often not the technical wherewithal but the financial will. \"People can have a base on the moon now if they are willing to pay for it,\" says Jim Lewis, director of technology policy at the US Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington DC. \"It's not clear to me that people want to, but we could do it.\" </p> <p>As Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in California, puts it: \"What defines each decade is not a technology's invention, but rather a dramatic shift in price and performance that triggers a sudden burst in diffusion from lab to marketplace.\" Lunar accommodation is still at the pricey end of the market - and that is unlikely to change by 2020.</p> <p>So what will change? The answer lies in the way information technology will transform our day-to-day lives. \"The big trends that are going to change things are the availability of cheap sensors that provide digital data, cheap computing power and ubiquitous connectivity - the ability to connect to networks,\" Lewis says. \"Then part of what I think people will do over the next decade is start to look for things they can automate, so you won't have to do them any more.\" In other words, by 2020 everything large enough to carry a microchip probably will, and from there the possibilities are endless.</p> <p>We could have fridges that can read the use-by date on the milk carton and order another litre before the current one goes off. We could be sent gas bills that include an electronic reminder to pay them. We could do our laundry in washing machines that contact service engineers when their bearings wear down, and that automatically arrange a visit after finding a window in your electronic organiser. \"You won't have to worry about whether you took your medicine,\" says Lewis. \"The medicine jar will know when it was last opened and how much its weight went down.\" </p> <p>Even low-value items such as household bricks could be fitted with individual electronic identifiers, allowing an architect or surveyor to walk round a half-finished school or hospital and see an image of the building skeleton pop up instantly on their ultra-thin laptop.</p> <p>The driver of this revolution will be the dreaded radio frequency identification (RFID) chip, the use of which to guard easily pocketed items such as razor blades against shoplifters has already attracted the attention of privacy groups in the UK. The chips, which can be as small as a grain of dust, communicate with detectors several metres away and transmit information, ranging from unique serial numbers to more complex product details. There are concerns they could be used as covert surveillance devices. Anyone with a detector could read any active chip in their vicinity, raising the possibility that embedded tags in clothing could be used to trigger customised adverts on nearby billboards, or that people could be tracked as they move.</p> <p>\"There is a loss of privacy that is going to be very difficult for people and we haven't figured out how to deal with that,\" Lewis says. \"But if you explain what is does, how much information it provides and where it goes - and that the trade-off is that you don't have to wait as long in line at the supermarket - then people will take the trade-off. With the right rules and regulations this sort of stuff should be more acceptable.\"</p> <p>Some of the trade-offs do seem appealing. How about RFID chips in your clothes that automatically programme your phone to different settings, depending on whether you are in your work or casual clothing? No more work calls in the pub, and no more football text messages in the middle of business meetings. </p> <p>By 2020, it is even possible that such devices will be able to communicate in ways vastly more sophisticated than the clumsy radio signals of today's wireless devices: in June this year the computer giant Microsoft was awarded a patent to transmit data by exploiting the electrical conductivity of human skin. Microsoft envisages using skin's conductive properties to link a host of electronic devices around the body, from pagers and personal data assistants (PDAs) to mobile phones and microphones. According to the patent, the technology could usher in a new class of portable and wearable electronic devices, such as earrings that deliver sounds sent from a phone worn on the belt, or special spectacles with screens that flash up images and video footage. </p> <p>Linking electronic devices raises other possibilities. Gadget lovers could use a single keypad to operate their phone, PDA and MP3 music player, or combine the output of their watch, pager and radio into a single speaker - assuming watches, pagers and radios still exist in their current form. </p> <p>It is certain that by 2020 a whole range of technologies will be on stream to make our daily lives simpler. One of the first could be a handheld \"electronic paper\" device, on to which books and the ultimate compact newspapers could be downloaded. Sony unveiled the latest and best prototype earlier this year in Japan, and as the price tag falls (it currently costs \u00a3220), so demand will rise. Others are working on electronic paper that, just like the real thing, can be rolled up and stuffed into a pocket. But as everyone who still prints their emails - to the dismay of acolytes of the paperless office - will swear, paper is a hard thing to make redundant.</p> <p>Other electronic boxes of tricks will be able to monitor our health. By 2020, we could have earrings able to read our pulse rates and bracelet monitors that analyse the composition of your sweat. Medical information would be sent through the skin to a central chip, which would be able to transmit all the necessary information to your doctor, back through the skin, when you shake hands with them at your appointment. Your updated medical history could be on the doctor's computer before you had even sat down. </p> <p>The rise and rise of RFID chips raises a new environmental problem: data pollution. \"When you walk down the street with your PDA, cellphone and laptop they will be bombarded with information. There will be all this noise out there and controlling this noise will be one of the problems we haven't thought about,\" Lewis says.</p> <p>Another will be the computing power needed to handle the deluge of information streaming from every angle. \"Hopefully one of the things that will change over the next 15 years is that we'll have much better software that will be much easier to use, much more transparent and will fail less often,\" he adds.</p> <p>One of the first areas of our lives likely to be affected by the coming information saturation will be transport, specifically the car. As the number of cars on the roads continues to rise, many believe the current system - in which each individual vehicle effectively goes where it pleases - is simply unsustainable. </p> <p>\"One reason why we have these enormous pile-ups and bumper-to-bumper gridlocks is because everybody is expressing their free will to go where they want, when they want to,\" says Stephen Millet, the \"thought leader\" and manager of technology forecasts at Battelle, a US company that publishes regular reviews of developing strategic technologies. \"I think what we're moving towards is every time we leave our garage we're going to file a driving plan to some central system, which will send back a message saying go ahead or don't go that way, it's all jammed up.\" Intelligent highways could pass back information on driving conditions, traffic density and roadworks to the master system, which would reduce speed limits or set up diversions accordingly. Speeding could even be made impossible - trials of \"smart\" GPS tracking satellite systems that prevent the car going over the limit for a particular stretch of road are already under way.</p> <p>\"I think if we had better information and better coordination then we could really go a long way to relieving gridlock,\" Millet says. What free driving we do should get easier - nobody was surprised when GPS navigation technology filtered down from luxury models to production cars; expect the same to happen with everything from smart cruise control, which uses radar to match the speed of the car in front, to infrared night-vision displays on windscreens.</p> <p>\"The big problem we'll run into is that as we put more computers and more electronics in the cars then where is the electricity going to come from?\" Millet says. \"I think we'll see fuel cells come on board to generate electricity because the alternator cannot bear the demand we'll be putting on it.\"</p> <p>Fuel cells - hi-tech batteries that draw power from a simple chemical reaction between fuel and air - could replace the current electric batteries found inside the increasingly popular hybrid cars. However, barring an extraordinary rise in oil prices, it's unlikely that anything will arrive by 2020 to seriously challenge the dominance of the internal combustion engine.</p> <p>Ignition keys could be consigned to a museum, however, and there is good news for the generation that grew up watching Knight Rider. \"Voice-pattern recognition is coming,\" Millet says. \"It's been slower than we thought but this business of being able to talk to your computer is definitely possible within 20 years. People are just going to have to be careful about what they say.\" And although expensive prototypes capable of crossing water and even taking to the skies have already been developed, the future of the automobile is undoubtedly a little more down to earth. </p> <p>Just don't expect technology to have delivered that sight beloved of science fiction movies: cars flying down the street, hovering in the air next to aerial doors. \"We've looked at flying cars and I'm very sceptical,\" Millet says. \"Having helicopters or flying cars is an enormous control problem and we have so much further we can go to improve land transportation. I think that will remain the preferred method.\"</p> <p>And what of robots? Will the current crop of hi-tech vacuum cleaners, expensive electronic pets and clumsy humanoids evolve into anything you would actually want to have around the house for more than novelty value?</p> <p>\"Do we really want that?\" says Paul Newman, a robotics expert at Oxford University. \"If I built a robot to do the dishes and it got it right 98% of the time then I'd be pretty pleased with it because it's way beyond what we can do now. But if it broke two out of 100 dishes then you would throw it out after a month.\" </p> <p>We are still a long way from developing robots that can interact with humans on any meaningful level, because their artificial intelligence brains simply cannot cope with change and unpredictable events - or anything they are not programmed to respond to. \"That's why robots do so well in car factories because you can engineer a situation to be absolutely predictable,\" explains Newman.</p> <p>Where robots will definitely make strides by 2020 is in places where sending a person would be hazardous, costly or impossible: there is already talk of sending a robot to fix the Hubble space telescope later this decade; by 2020 fleets of underwater robots could patrol the oceans, surfacing regularly to beam back environmental data on temperature, acidity and salinity. \"Then if we had a machine that was only 70% successful that's a whole lot better because previously we couldn't do it in the first place,\" Newman says.</p> <p>But to go beyond the performance of repetitive data-gathering or maintenance tasks, robots must be able to answer the simple question: where am I? \"Fundamentally it's just very difficult to get a robot to tell the difference between a picture of a tree and real tree,\" Newman says. </p> <p>Still, great advances in artificial intelligence by 2020 cannot be ruled out - although they would be dependent on the kinds of things we cannot predict. \"You're talking about the Isaac Newton of AI coming along,\" Newman says. \"It could happen next month - someone could produce something and we all say, 'Of course, why didn't we think of that?'\"</p> <p>The same is true in other fields, too. \"If we could find different ways to create energy or lift things off the ground, that would be really helpful,\" says Lewis at the CSIS. \"That's the kind of breakthrough that doesn't appear to be on the horizon, but if someone locks on to something then someday we might see something very different emerge. That's what I would look for.\" </p> <p>As speculative peeks into the future go, that's the closest you will get to a hot tip. Just remember that even HG Wells got the future wrong.</p>",
  "Baked beans. Big Ben. The blitz. Bobby Moore. Bannockburn. Some symbols of our identity appear as fixed cultural points in a changing landscape. Others crystallise particular moments, helping us define exactly who we are and how we are seen. <p>The current British self-image largely rests on images of expansionism and ingenuity. The idea of \"overcoming the odds\" runs deeply through our histories of ourselves. But like our faces as we age, our cultural identity can change imperceptibly. Suddenly, a reflection seen from a new angle shows an accumulation of tiny changes that significantly alters the overall appearance.</p> <p>Such reinterpretations of national identity are often triggered by an unexpected event: the abdication crisis of 1936; the blitz; Suez; the intervention of the International Monetary Fund in 1976; the 1984 miners' strike; the death of Diana - all had an impact on our national sense of self. So who might we be in 2020? Which of the myriad small changes currently taking place will define us? Which activities and institutions will dominate our sense of ourselves?</p> <p>One way to gauge the nature of the changes the nation is likely to undergo by 2020 is to look back the same distance in time. In 1988 EastEnders was Britain's most popular soap opera and Thatcherism was in its high summer. The major privatisations were behind us, but the poll tax was only just beginning to glimmer. House prices were booming but the stock market had crashed. Mobile phones were a novelty item and the second summer of love was in full swing in Manchester's clubland. Rumours about Charles and Diana's marriage troubles were beginning to spread. Nobody had uttered the words \"New Labour\" in public and conventional wisdom saw race riots as a thing of the past. The Berlin Wall stood intact.</p> <p>Much of that seems reassuringly familiar, but there have also been abrupt changes. The television programme that prompts office conversation is a real-life soap opera, with people locked in a house for three months. A CND supporter of the 80s is prime minister - and led us to war. The poll tax is a distant memory and that the nature of the monarchy has changed is beyond doubt, despite the leadership of the Firm remaining in place. The utterly unexpected can therefore materialise alongside the easily predictable. This will remain true as we go forward to 2020.</p> <p>We make sense of change partly by falling back on shared national or cultural characteristics: a psychological dependence on a successful past; confidence in one's own tolerance and sense of fair play; the maintenance of a particular family or religious tradition; a belief in one's own formative beliefs and values as radical, even once the comfortable trappings of middle age have been bought and paid for. But all these types of self-image will be tested by the way our society changes over the next generation. The question is whether we can respond in ways which strengthen or diminish them.</p> <p>The traditional analysis holds that the story of Britain over the past half-century is one of decline. Despite rising wealth, social freedoms and political projects dedicated to national renewal, we have struggled to overcome the pervasive decay. Our grand institutions - the trade unions, the church, the monarchy - are all in retreat. Britons' willingness to make an emotional or political investment in those external institutions has fallen dramatically. The number of people prepared to say they have great confidence in the legal system, the church, the civil service or parliament has more than halved since the early 1980s, from a healthy majority to a creaking minority. But asked who they trust to tell the truth, the British are more likely than 20 years ago to identify teachers, doctors, professors and newsreaders, and overall levels of trust appear not to have declined catastrophically, apart from trust in politicians.</p> <p>Although the erosion of traditional social organisations has not diminished our sociability, the onward march of individualism - either through choice or fate - is still probably the major force shaping our society. British society in 2020 will be significantly older than today, which will further that process of individualisation. Those over 65 will be a third as many again as those of working age, as opposed to a quarter as many again today. The combination of the postwar baby boom, increased life expectancy and declining fertility rates will mean a million more people over 65 than under 16. As a result we will spend twice as much money on health and long-term care.</p> <p>Intertwined with ageing is the shrinking size of our households, so that by 2020 about a third of us will be living alone, and as many as 2 million older people may have no regular contact with friends or family. These new household structures will also drive suburbanisation, as more people spill into the space between the inner-city neighbourhoods and the rural villages.</p> <p>How we communicate will help determine who we are - a transformation that has already begun with the mobile phone culture. Mobiles were barely a feature of life in 1988, but a recent survey found that 46% of young British adults described the loss of their phone as akin to bereavement. Phones are just one way we tell the world about ourselves. We can already construct historical and family narratives from the internet, create newsgroups and meet strangers with shared interests.</p> <p>We design our bodies in gyms and tattoo studios; by 2020 we could be doing so in the genetics lab and the prosthetic workshop. The use of diet and drugs to enhance performance will spread from elite sport and start a new mass debate about how to boost intelligence and educational achievement. So the cultural pressure to define and design ourselves will only grow between now and 2020. We cannot know how we will respond to those choices, but their very existence will make discussion of human nature and identity central to our self-perception.</p> <p>The changes in society will pit personal identity against the more traditional markers of collective belonging - the belief systems and rituals underpinning everything from politics and the church to television viewing and football supporting. People will still care about these activities, but they will be much less likely to organize their own lives around fixed institutional routines.</p> <p>Television over the past 50 years has reinforced our common identity and culture by amplifying shared social events. We would remember key TV moments, such as Gazza crying or Angela Rippon on Morecambe and Wise, and talk about them the next day. But the same forces that are fragmenting our cultural loyalties are at work on television, too. Already, about 60% of households have multichannel TV and the internet, and by 2020 the model of terrestrial broadcasting most of us grew up with will be a dusty memory.</p> <p>Given all this, the central question is: will the slow collapse of institutions that have been vehicles for our shared identity mean the collapse of the identity itself? The answer is that we should not be too afraid, for our essential cultural characteristic as Britons is, arguably, not the way we cling to past verities but the way we change with the cultural tides. A mixture of pragmatism and self-preservation has blended British culture and politics into new forms many times over the centuries. It is why Chaucer's 14th-century English would be unrecognisable to today's English speaker, and probably why English is now the global business language.</p> <p>This quality of pragmatism is experienced as tradition by many Britons, but as arrogance and ingenuity in equal measure by much of the rest of the world. It has enabled us to reinvent ourselves by stealth while maintaining a pose of continuity. In working out how this pattern might unfold over the next 16 years, three features of the landscape are especially influential.</p> <p>The first is hybrid culture, which is the art of mixing different elements to create a coherent whole - that is the logic by which ours was identified as a \"mongrel nation\" in Philip Dodd's 1995 Demos essay The Battle Over Britain. The second area is the rise of the city-region as a source of economic dynamism and a vehicle for identity. While regional government may continue to stutter, regional identities are strengthening. Third comes Britain's cultural relationship with the rest of the world; as power and wealth swing east towards Asia, this will develop into a form of reverse colonialism.</p> <p>This year's film of King Arthur self-consciously relocated the familiar legend to a different period - the end of the Roman occupation of Britain. If you forget the acting, the film is a masterclass in the art of myth-making through breeding hybrids. It purports to document the birth of a Greater Britain and the rise of its English icon, Arthur. The plot races through imperial withdrawal, Saxon invasion, Celtic resistance, the compassionate defence of women and children, an embryonic theory of equality through free will, military triumph against the odds, and romance, climaxing in intermarriage and the birth of a new British dynasty. Not bad for two hours, especially given the number of battles the film-makers had to slot in. King Arthur both portrays and typifies the art of cultural mixing that has made up the British identity. Our sense of what it means to be British has evolved from successive waves of settlement, conquest, intermingling, trade and exchange. One way in which we have done this is to construct institutions - the monarchy, armed forces, the civil service, the British Museum, the BBC - that have all enabled successful mixing by establishing shared symbols and traditions. Throughout the waves of change, however, those institutions - with their own distinct culture - have maintained a serene view that Britain exports civilisation through commonsense values and organisational methods. </p> <p>Helpful though it has been, that view does not match the reality. From baked beans to gin and tonic, from Birmingham balti to tea with milk, our trademark foods are the result of combining foreign cultural practices with local tastes. My great-grandfather entered family history in the 1940s on visiting a Chinese restaurant, inspecting the menu and declaring, \"I can't deal with any of this foreign nonsense; bring me a cup of tea.\" Hybridity has always been part of our lives, whether we realised it or not.</p> <p>Hybrid culture will have a special claim on the next generation, precisely because it holds the greatest cultural dynamism and energy. As tradition declines, we are left to form our identities while increasingly exposed, by global communications, travel and trade, to a much wider range of cultural influences and pressures. Amid an ageing population, for example, the fastest-growing ethnic category in Britain is \"black - mixed race\". Half the people in this group are under 16, while just 8% are over 45. The number of people from ethnic minorities grew by half during the 1990s, from less than 5% to almost 8% of the population.</p> <p>Film, television and literature are increasingly fascinated by what happens when cultures connect, collide and combine. From East is East and Goodness Gracious Me to Massive Attack and Mike Skinner, from Monica Ali to Ms Dynamite, Salman Rushdie to Irvine Welsh, our most potent pieces of culture emerge from the ability to meld the disparate elements at work in Britain into a coherent but edgy whole. This will spread from the arts into the wider culture. The brokers of our society will increasingly be those who can interpret and navigate such differences.</p> <p>Just as our culture evolves new hybrids, so will our politics. Politicians are increasingly absorbed in trying to handle the conflicts generated by cultural collision, from the US-EU split over Iraq to community division in Bradford and Burnley. However, despite the accelerating demographic trends, by 2020 it is unlikely that more than 15% of the whole British population will come from ethnic minority backgrounds. Race should not be the dominant issue of our political debate, but it will still be a trigger for wider debates about shared culture, as it is now. </p> <p>Perhaps most intriguing are the newly blended national cultures of Scotland, Wales and Ireland. In Scotland, the long wait for a constitutional settlement has been immediately followed by a wave of anti-political disillusionment. A recent survey found that only 2-3% of voters considered the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly to have serious influence over their lives. One of Scotland's main newspapers refused to endorse any party in the most recent Scottish parliamentary elections, an extraordinary event for so new a system. Yet as a current Demos project on Scotland in 2020 has found, there is strong commitment to creating a distinctive, creative and optimistic Scottish political identity that can circumvent dependence on political institutions.</p> <p>New, flexible governing arrangements will offer scaffolding to hybrid identities. It is no coincidence that this is happening at sub-national level. In Northern Ireland, the political rules are actually designed to allow two opposing nationalist cultures to coexist peacefully. In England the renaissance of city-regions is obscured by London's impact as a city-state and its tendency to suck in skills and wealth from surrounding areas. But, partly driven by economics, the cultural character and influence of major British cities are changing.</p> <p>The shape of these cities, from housing to neighbourhoods to transport links, was formed around the industries that provided most jobs: steel in Sheffield, the Liverpool docks, shipbuilding in Glasgow, chocolate-making in Birmingham and so on. Now they are being transformed by new patterns of wealth arising from other kinds of work: law, finance, media, software, science. Cultural activities, symbols and buildings play a newly important part in the shaping of city centres. \"Doughnut\" structures of wealth and travel - whereby money concentrates in city centres by day and travels into outer suburbs, new towns and commuter villages by night - are entrenching poverty at the neglected edges of cities. But the city-regions offer new symbols and forms of congregation. </p> <p>In the wider world, the global shift of economic, cultural and technological power eastwards will have a profound influence. China's rise will challenge the assumptions underpinning layers of our identity - from western interpretations of democracy to philosophies of class and well-being. But the economic dynamism of Asian nations will create a new need for us to compete for their attention, and to succeed in supplying services and know-how to them, rather than simply competing against them for jobs and investment. In a generation's time our wealth will be drawn, as it was in past eras, from our place within global networks of exchange.</p> <p>In navigating this new world, Britain has a great opportunity. Our colonial legacy ought to prompt mutual understanding and empathy with other cultures and nations, not just resentment at decline of our power or the injustices of past British rule. Much of the most important cultural production in English now arises from the cultures of the commonwealth, from places that were dominated and then abandoned by British institutions and have generated their own hybrid identities. By 2020 we will need to have turned our past to our advantage and engaged with our former empire again - this time as collaborator, rather than conqueror.</p> <p>But doing this requires us to overcome our equally strong tendency towards insularity, to engage more confidently with the unfamiliar, and to understand cultural difference better. Too often, a British (and especially English) attitude to the world has rested on the aggressive assertion of \"common sense\" - a tactic still used by Britons of all classes.</p> <p>In turn, our ability to engage properly with the world may rest on our success in finding new, popular vehicles for shared identity within Britain. Our capacity for creating hybrid identities from disparate ingredients is beyond dispute. But our success in doing so again by 2020 is not assured. It is perfectly plausible to see the splintering of identity and allegiance into many different cultural tribes; some socially conservative, insular and resentful, some hedonistically self-absorbed, some cosmopolitan but detached from the everyday life of most others. The diminishing influence of our institutions could leave no one with the power to mediate successfully between these mutually ignorant clans. </p> <p>So it would be too easy to conclude that we can all become naturally confident cosmopolitans. In a survey last year 77% of those polled said different cultures in Britain coexist rather than connect with each other. At the same time, however, 80% of the same survey thought we could not build a new British society without interacting with different cultures.</p> <p>Learning to live in a new society - especially one reflecting cultures profoundly different from the one you were born into - is a painful process, and for many people the incentives to make the effort are weak. But there are some grounds for hope. A study last year by Richard Florida, the prophet of the \"creative class\" in North America, found that tolerance and respect for difference in Britain are comparatively high in Britain compared to other European societies. There is clear evidence that people's interest in political issues and social fairness remains strong, even though they are less likely to engage through traditional channels.</p> <p>Who, then, will the new Briton be in 2020? Imagine a millennium baby, born in 2000, approaching 20 years old. She will have a life expectancy of 90 and will be trying to imagine a working life of at least 50 years. Her job prospects will depend heavily on her educational credentials, and she will expect at least five more years of formal training. Specialist skills, particularly ones that can be used creatively, will determine her earning power. She is already likely to be accumulating big debts in order to finance her pathway towards this specialist skill.</p> <p>Our young woman's network of friends and family will be crucially important to her; more so than her ethnic or national identity. That will continue a trend already in process: a study in the mid-90s found that most people saw their own values, principles and friends as being more important to their own identity than being a Briton; in the 2001 census, only 46% of people described themselves as British. This woman's informal network, though she may not yet know it, will have a profound influence on her future opportunities and life chances, and may play the most direct role in how far she travels in later life.</p> <p>The likelihood is that her social values will be more liberal even than today's typical young people, and that economic liberalism will largely look like common sense. Some specific \"ethical\" issue - maybe climate change or human rights or stem cell research - will dominate her political sense, but if she has joined a political party she will be among a tiny minority.</p> <p>Her knowledge of the detail of British history and sense of allegiance to a \"national\" culture will be significantly weaker than it might be today, but her critical abilities - communication, and the ability to access and investigate different forms of culture - are likely to be much sharper. She will customise her use of the dizzying array of media services with a degree of discrimination and fluency we would find surprising today.</p> <p>That sense of discernment might apply equally to her sense of identity, which will be moulded from family, neighbourhood and city. She might be a devout Christian, though she would be slightly more likely to be a practising Muslim. Either way, if it is a strong and explicit part of her identity, she may well have discovered a faith for herself and opted to join a specific community rather than simply inheriting a general tradition.</p> <p>By 2020 it is unlikely that our young adults will be \"citizens of the world\" in any full-blooded sense that really banishes British identity. Although a global outlook is increasingly common, it is hard to see how anyone could find forms of identity strong enough to channel allegiance in any meaningful way. But the attachments we form to particular organisations, causes or routines are the institutional expression of our values. If we take the globally connected outlook our millennium child will have, we can see that exclusively national institutions will have begun to overlap and blur with other layers of identity: time spent studying at European universities, working with American NGOs or living in cities to which she feels especially drawn. </p> <p>The strongest desire among younger generations in western societies is to shape their lives in accordance with their own values. That is not mindless hedonism or historical amnesia, but in 2020 we will still need strong institutional attachments. A healthy, durable collective identity will not flourish without them. But the most successful institutions of 2020 could be anything: colleges or campuses, new kinds of cooperative, online communities, sports clubs, issue-based campaigns or neighbourhood associations. They could thrive in a world where the Church of England, the civil service, the broadsheet newspaper or the BBC have ceased to exist. But whatever form they take, and whatever myths and symbols they project, theirs will be the task of negotiating the mix of foreign and familiar on which Britain has always been based. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Tom Bentley is the director of the Demos thinktank (<a href=\"http:www.demos.co.uk\"> www.demos.co.uk</a>)</p>",
  "<p>No one would expect to be let loose on a cat in need of stitches or a dog with a stomach full of golf balls unless they had the appropriate qualifications. The education of vets and veterinary nurses is well established, but what about less life-and-death pet care occupations: petsitters, dog walkers, poodle clippers, stablehands, horse whisperers, dog listeners, cat aromatherapists, puppy socialisers? Education for most pet carers is considerably less structured, where it exists at all. </p> <p>Charities and state institutions have their own solution: do the job yourself. The police, Customs and Excise, the prison service and the armed forces run their own training programmes for dog handlers, who are generally selected from existing personnel. If you want to be an RSPCA inspector (and lots do: the charity receives about 2,000 applications a year for 20 posts), you will have to be accepted for its six-month training course. Charities that train assistance dogs for disabled people run similar in-house schemes. </p> <p>But many people who work with animals are employed by smaller organisations or run their own businesses, having learned on the job in grooming parlours, stables, catteries and kennels. Such hands-on apprenticeships can, and do, produce highly skilled and caring professionals, but the absence of formal qualifications can leave pet owners feeling uneasy. </p> <p>After all, how do you know that you're employing someone who can actually get your dog to sit on command (without shouting it into submission) or who'll genuinely understand why your two rabbits are no longer on nose-twitching terms? Is a West Highland terrier really supposed to be that bald in summer? Are you giving money to someone who doesn't know the back end of a shih-tzu from a portly guinea pig? </p> <p>Trade associations, accreditation schemes and college courses have sprung up to settle the public's nerves and professionalise the ever expanding pet services market. Would-be pet pros can now, for example, sign up for a City &amp; Guilds in dog grooming or canine studies, or a higher national diploma in equine studies. </p> <p>Pet behaviour counselling - often dubbed dog psychiatry or pet therapy by the media - is a rapid growth industry, which is no bad thing in my view. This sort of counselling has nothing to do with mental health, psychoanalysis or blaming the cat's mother; it draws on a scientific understanding of natural animal behaviour to help troublesome or unhappy pets. There is no formal study route for pet behaviourists, but the Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors says that counsellors should have an academic knowledge of the theory of behaviour, as well as practical handling skills: \"A degree in behavioural studies, veterinary medicine, psychology or one of the biological sciences can provide the best background.\" A handful of universities now incorporate companion animal modules into their animal behaviour degree courses. </p> <p>Some people simply want to be better informed pet owners or charity volunteers. Edinburgh University has recently started companion animal distance learning courses, while the Animal Care College offers correspondence courses in the care and management of small companion animals. The Centre of Applied Pet Ethology has a similar range of courses, including rescue and rehoming, and a one-day introductory course for wannabe pet behaviourists. </p> <p>Many educational paths lead to a career with companion animals, and word of mouth can be as important as letters after your name. And, like all good students, both consumers and those who'd like to work with pets need to do their homework. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:GuardianPets@aol.com\">GuardianPets@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<p>So we're all going to be smartening up this season. Meaning a lot more men are going to be wearing a lot more suits. That's what the Guardian fashion desk are saying, anyway, and they wanted someone to road test a few. </p> <p>I'd like to think they picked their model for his catwalk looks, his sense of style, his understanding of fine threads. In truth, I know why they chose him: I'm the office scruff, and they thought it would be amusing to dress me up for a few days. </p> <p>I never need to wear a suit for my work. I'm a television critic, I don't deal with people, I sit in the dark; sometimes I do my job in my birthday suit. There is one suit in the wardrobe at home which I enjoy wearing, but my friends who are going to get married are pretty much all married, and they're not dying yet, so it rarely comes out these days. Would I like to spend a week wearing a different suit every day? Are you kidding? Of course I would. </p> <p>I'm new to fashion journalism, so you'll have to excuse the limited vocabulary. And I'm not quite sure if I'm the journalist, the model, or what. Should I be throwing a tantrum and demanding cocaine? I don't think I even know how much I don't get out of bed for. </p> <p>Anyway, first up is a chocolate-brown suit from Burberry. I thought Burberry meant check, Danniella Westbrook and football hooligans, but no, say my expert sources. That's just a small part of Burberry; it's also a very classy label. This one has a moddish feel to it, makes me feel like hopping on a scooter and heading to the seaside for a fight. And it has two slits up the back - a fart flap I believe is the technical term - that I don't like. But otherwise this is a nice suit; it feels quite sharp. </p> <p>I thought I would command new levels of respect and exude authority at work. Instead I'm greeted by laughter and the sort of faces you see on the victims of Changing Rooms - stunned incredulity. As well as the expected job interview comments, I'm told I have a touch of the \"school discos\" about me, and one colleague just repeats \"you're wearing a suit\" all day long. Ignorant, styleless people. </p> <p>The next suit looks quite tweedy and posh, but in fact comes from Topman. I would really like it if they hadn't made me wear a blue cravat with it. Who do they think I am? Tim Nice But Dim? James Hewitt? This suit costs \u00a3200, which is an incredible bargain, ideal for next time you get invited to a large country pile and you don't have the time (or the cash) to have one tailor-made at Gieves &amp; Hawkes. Just make sure no one sees that label though, or you may find yourself on an early train home and missing the pheasant shooting. </p> <p>Reiss next, a shiny grey suit with a grey shirt, and a matching grey tie - handy if you want to blend in on the deck of a warship, or among a team of Dixons sales assistants. In Chatham. Yes, though it feels good, looks quite good, too, I'm far too much of a snob to want to wear it. There should be a label in the jacket saying, \"Dry clean only. Hang in the back of a Vauxhall Astra.\" Come on, guys, this is supposed to be my week of dressing up. </p> <p>Whoa there, now what the hell is this? Sonia Rykiel? Who's she? I don't care, it's red! Sonia may be at the pinnacle of Paris chic, but this suit says only one thing to me: Hi-De-Hi. And in case you're not getting the red message properly, the shirt is red, too, as is the tie. Good morning, campers. Now take it away. </p> <p>Ah, now that's more like it. Cool, elegant, sober, Armani. At last these clowns seem to realise what I'm about. Finally a suit I feel comfortable in, that's not shouting, \"I'm a twat\", but whispering, \"I'm stylish, classy, and understated.\" It's me, I'll take it.</p>",
  "Our research into the fate of women and girls in Afghanistan who attempt suicide by burning to escape violence in the home (Death by fire, September 14) indicates that the problem is depressingly widespread. Doctors, NGOs and locals have reported a pattern of suicide - including self-immolation - among Afghan women. A particular vulnerability exists among under-age brides. Forced and under-age marriage in Afghanistan is leading to young girls becoming victims of violence within the home with little access to legal redress or shelter. With elections imminent, it is crucial that a future Afghan government acts to stop violence against women by ensuring they have the full protection of the law. <br> <b>Kate Allen</b> <br> Director, Amnesty International UK",
  "Fancy a personal pension? The new minister wants to know. As he says: \"You can't trust governments to provide a decent retirement income. <p>\"It can be cheap and simple. Like the low charging stakeholder plan (that so few of you have taken up, naughty people). Pensions are great. </p> <p>\"What do you mean you're not interested. Look, I recognise there are no guarantees, but a pension is the best tax break in town. And what if I force your employer to make a contribution. Turn it into an occupational pension and get them to pay 10% of salary. I can't say fairer than that.\" </p> <p>Well, maybe we can say fairer than that. Compelling employers to make pension contributions is becoming favoured in the corridors of power as the best way to solve the much talked about pension crisis. A \"get out of jail card\" in the shape of a law demanding employers cough up 10% or even 15% of salary that could be bolted to the current pensions bill. </p> <p>But forcing employers to make substantial pensions contributions is fraught with difficulty and would be the equivalent of sticking plasters on a body that has already lost several pints of blood. Too little too late. It could also send the body into shock. </p> <p>Unions might be all in favour, but there are independent minded experts who see fundamental flaws. For instance, why should someone be forced to pay into the equivalent of a personal pension scheme that is dependent on the stock market? At the moment there are plenty of people heading in the opposite direction, cashing in their personal pensions to buy cars and pay off credit card bills because they fear more stock market crashes. They may be misguided, but they could also be far-sighted seers. Should we use legislation to compel them to contribute when they might be better using the cash to make alternative provision? </p> <p>Anyone on a low income could also be a victim of misselling. Savers with a fund below \u00a380,000 will qualify for at least some state benefits. When the average pension pot is around the \u00a330,000 mark, it is a racing certainty for many. They might have been better saving in ISAs and spending spare money on property instead. </p> <p>Pension adviser Ros Altmann says the Australians did it and found the economy went into shock. Switching employers and their staff from spending to saving overnight was a retailer's worst nightmare. </p> <p>We need a more radical approach and sticking plaster does not qualify.</p>",
  "Twenty minutes into launching the Liberal Democrat draft manifesto (\"Freedom, fairness, trust\") came the inevitable \"left or right?\" question from the press. If our faces fell, it was because the question has become so meaningless. <p>The terms left and right became fixed in the lexicon in an era when the great political debate centred internationally on the fight between communism and the market economies, and in Britain between a Labour party committed to state ownership and the Conservatives committed to privatisation. \"Left\" was shorthand for nationalisation, strikes, state spending and state controls - and \"fairness\" (usually termed \"equality\") even at the cost of enforced conformity. \"Right\" meant privatisation, cutting spending on schools and hospitals, traditional views on \"moral\" issues, law and order - and \"freedom\" (usually meaning the right to spend your cash) even at the cost of injustice. </p> <p>Liberals were derided as the \"soggy centre\" precisely because we wanted spending so that schools and hospitals were of high quality, but also smaller central government. We opposed much nationalisation, but supported tougher consumer protection and pro-competition policies. We championed freedom of the individual, but tempered by equal access to education and health and a safety net of social welfare for when things go wrong. We sought balance - and are now rarely criticised for it because just about everyone has recognised we were right. </p> <p>With the collapse of the state ownership model, the Labour party seeks to outflank the Conservatives on \"choice\". Meanwhile, no longer united to see off socialism, the Conservatives are split down the middle between social libertarians and family values moralists. Left and right still have emotive and negative meanings to many people, so these days our political opponents like to use them about the Liberal Democrats - and rarely about themselves. Would the prime minister declare he is leftwing? Or Michael Howard that he is proud to be a rightwinger? </p> <p>Liberal Democrats refuse to be pigeonholed into left or right. We believe that the 20th-century division into left and right failed because society needs both freedom and fairness. As LT Hobhouse and the New Liberals said a hundred years ago, \"the struggle for liberty... is the struggle for equality\". Basically, people can't be free if they don't have the chance of decent education, health, and freedom from the fear of poverty in sickness or old age. Today we'd add that there isn't much freedom in a decaying environment either. But we don't want state control or regimentation. The political debate has moved on. Especially on to that much older division, liberal or illiberal. </p> <p>Take this example. David Blunkett and David Davis would both leave asylum seekers destitute, want every citizen to carry an ID card and have supported the removal of the right to silence. Left and right, but equally illiberal. Liberal Democrats oppose these measures because we believe it is vital to protect the citizen from an over-mighty state. So the press label us leftwing. We say it's liberal. </p> <p>Then we propose measures to remove subsidies to big business and cut back central government and they say we have shifted to the right. But liberals have always championed small central government and the free market economy, to maximise individual and local choice. </p> <p>The draft manifesto we published this week is not left or right - but it is firmly liberal. Take two examples. The first of these is giving more power to people who use and work in public services. It's our view that schools and hospitals will deliver better results to citizens when they are locally accountable. </p> <p>We also think that improvements will come when professionals are freed from the central government interference that the Tories introduced and which Labour has multiplied. That does not fit anywhere in the left-right divide, but is thoroughly liberal. </p> <p>Take also the environment. Labour and the Conservatives have traditionally neglected it. Conservatives have aimed for minimal government involvement in the economy, to give business as free a rein as possible. Labour has sought to create jobs in the short term, with little regard to which jobs are most sustainable. The liberal approach is to use markets to persuade people to act in ways that are environmentally sustainable, particularly using the tax system to encourage green behaviour. All underpinned by a passionate commitment to the environment as a duty to future generations. That approach has been sadly lacking from left-right political debates, but it is a core aspect of liberalism. </p> <p>All of this poses great challenges for political commentators, who look for simplistic soundbites even more than politicians do. But go out of the Westminster bubble and people have moved on. They want to be treated as individuals, not classes. It is time politicians (and the press) had the same maturity. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Matthew Taylor MP is chairman of the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:taylorm@parliament.uk\">taylorm@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "The rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, has pulled out of a countryside event this weekend on police advice, amid fears for his safety following the passing of the bill to ban hunting this week. <p>Mr Michael, who was the target of the five invaders who stormed the Commons chamber on Wednesday to protest against the ban, had been due to join a countryside walk on Sunday to celebrate the government's new \"right to roam\" legislation.</p> <p>But tonight he pulled out of the event, citing \"police intelligence\" that large numbers of protestors were intending to hijack the event and target him personally as the minister responsible for guiding the hunting legislation through the Commons.</p> <p>Mr Michael, in a statement tonight, said: \"Following advice from the Lancashire and Derbyshire police forces I have reluctantly decided not to join the planned celebrations this weekend to mark the beginning of access to open country.</p> <p>\"According to police intelligence, my presence has attracted large numbers of protesters who oppose a ban on hunting and seek to hijack an unrelated event simply to gain publicity for their cause.\"</p> <p>The statement came as the Countryside Alliance said it planned to demonstrate as Mr Michael walked across land opened up under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act. </p> <p>The lobby group, which staged Wednesday's rally outside the Commons, has organised a small protest at the Forest of Blowand in Lancashire, the first area the minister was due to visit on Sunday, but a larger event is scheduled for what would have been his second venue, in the Peak District's Goyt Valley. </p> <p>Although a spokesman for the Alliance earlier this week condemned the violent actions of protesters who clashed with police in Parliament Square and invaded the Commons, the organisation was forced to admit that some of its members were among them.</p> <p>Mr Michael added: \"Sunday's landmark ceremonies mark the culmination of a tremendous amount of hard work and cooperation by a lot of people from many different organisations, to make the Countryside and Rights of Way Act a reality. </p> <p>\"It would be deeply regrettable if protesters targeting me individually as a government minister responsible for a separate piece of legislation detracted in any way from those celebrations or undermined this historic occasion. </p> <p>\"I wish all those who attend the formal celebrations a wonderful day.\" </p> <p>Mr Michael was to have begun the \"right to roam\" celebrations to mark the new act coming into force on Sunday, by visiting the historic area of Kinder Scout in Derbyshire. </p> <p>It was the scene of mass protests in 1932, when hundreds of ramblers deliberately trespassed. </p> <p>The event was later immortalised in the song The Manchester Rambler, by folk singer Ewan MacColl, father of the pop star Kirsty MacColl. </p> <p>Richard Dodd of the Countryside Alliance had said they were planning a peaceful and lawful protest on Sunday but had no plans to demonstrate at Kinder Scout. </p> <p>Mr Dodd, speaking before Mr Michael announced that he would not be attending, said: \"Alun Michael will be there to celebrate freedom to roam, which is a bit hypocritical. People have the freedom to roam but he's closed down all the fox hunts. He's called the minister for the countryside but he's done very little for the countryside.\" </p> <p>On Sunday morning Mr Michael was to have made a breakfast speech in the village of Chipping, Lancashire, and then walked in the Forest of Bowland. </p> <p>He was then scheduled to join hundreds of ramblers and representatives of countryside organisations at Derbyshire Bridge in Goyt Valley, where further speeches had been planned before he was to have been taken on a guided tour of land opened up under the act.</p>",
  "<p>'Get me to the church on time!\" - <strong> Alan Jay Lerner </strong> </p> <p>Family was in short supply at Sam Mitchell's wedding in <strong> EastEnders</strong> (BBC1). Peggy flew in from Rio dressed as a pink chicken but Phil was still on the run and Grant was on a business trip.

He looks at Sam as a boxer looks at a Bonio. Last night he was legging it to the church, presumably to bite the groom because marrying a girl to get your hands on her pub is not, as far as I know, a just impediment. Will he arrive in time? The kind of dog people rarely associate with Minty is a whippet. </p> <p>In <strong> I'll Show Them Who's Boss</strong> (BBC2), Gerry Robinson bullied the Moore family laundry into profitability. There is something rather romantic about a laundry. Steam escapes in orgasmic gasps. Sheets swirl overhead, flapping like airborne ghosts. But Robinson was looking at the floor. \"Why don't you clean the bloody place up? For Christ's sake, clean the place up! It's absolutely bloody filthy.\" </p> <p>Old Moore and his two sons, Tim and Anthony, ran the company. Who, Robinson wanted to know, was really in charge of the clattering train? </p> <p>Wherever he went among the disaffected staff (and I must say they seized the opportunity to slag off the management with some vim) he heard the same name, Gordon. As in \"Morale has gone down and down and down since Gordon left.\" </p> <p>Who Gordon was and why he still haunted the place turned into quite a little thriller. Had he, perhaps, failed to notice the poorly displayed warning Do Not Put Head in Washer? Gordon Dick, a popular operations director, had been unceremoniously sacked after 10 years' successful service. As Anthony put it: \"He turned into an overhead that wasn't giving us value for money.\" The desire to shove Anthony's head in the washer took some resisting. </p> <p>Robinson went to find Gordon. He was a big, pleasant man, quietly wounded like someone fired on by their own side. Robinson saw red. \"He was central to the building up of this business from something quite parochial to something significant, and he's been shot in the head. It think it's deeply, deeply unfair. I am so bloody annoyed on his behalf.\" </p> <p>He summoned the family to a summit and read them the riot act. \"You have made the single biggest mistake of your commercial existence. An enormous mistake. I strongly recommend that you're big enough to talk to Gordon.\" Saying which, he produced Gordon from his hat. </p> <p>So Gordon became chairman, the staff greeted him quite literally with open arms and Robinson, who usually sits in his London eyrie watching things go wrong with a grapefruit face, beamed benevolently. </p> <p>Let's make it into a musical. </p> <p>In <strong> Map Man</strong> (BBC2), Nicholas Crane, one of the world's incandescent enthusiasts, tramped across Scotland from Loch Ness to Loch Rannoch using a 250-year-old map. We were swept along in his slipstream. After Culloden, the Highlands were mapped by 21-year-old William Roy for a chilling reason: \"To impose control you need a good map.\" This delicately beautiful map, the British Library's greatest treasure, was a weapon of suppression. We now knew where they lived. </p> <p>You would take off your hat to William Roy if it weren't for the weather. Crane froze and flailed in the gale. He slept in Snugburrow where Roy slept out of the teeth of the storm. He called it sleeping with ghosts. Guided by Charlie, a gamekeeper, he forded an icy river, both feeling their way cautiously with crooks. \"If you're trapped in the water you have between nine and 15 minutes,\" said Charlie. \"Before you get hypothermia?\" Charlie said nothing. \"Before you die?\" \"You have mebbe a wee bit more in the summertime,\" said Charlie, always one to look on the bright side. </p> <p>You couldn't fail to notice that Crane had an umbrella sticking out of his rucksack. He didn't explain but, if we don't ask, it will blot out the sun for us. It seems he got the idea from Spanish peasants. There is nothing like an umbrella for rain, sun and wind, when it can act as a sail. It can also be used for warding off dogs. He was not troubled by a single dog, which shows how effective it is.</p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Saturday September 18 2004</b> <br> A letter in the following article was unfortunately edited to give the impression that the writer, Mike Nellis, supported fox hunting. Mr Nellis began his letter by stating his opposition to the blood sport and went on to make the point that criminalisation of an activity should only take place where there is a threat to human rights. <p>Your leader about Wednesday's hunting protests (September 16) unfairly implies that the Countryside Alliance was responsible for an intimidatory \"assault\" on parliament and for \"encouraging violent protest\". First, the break-in to the chamber by the few angry but unarmed and unaggressive protesters had nothing to do with the alliance. We neither sanctioned nor knew about this in advance, and we immediately repudiated it as soon as it happened. Second, the alliance has done everything in its power very effectively for several years to deter unruly protest and to keep the lid on the simmering anger in many rural communities. The violent clashes between police and some protesters were highly unfortunate but came about despite, not as a result of, our efforts. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that the scuffles were confined to a small group of demonstrators, while the vast majority behaved in an orderly, peaceable fashion. The alliance has always cooperated fully with the police to ensure the most orderly, well-behaved events, and we remain totally committed to facilitating peaceful, law-abiding protest.<br><b>Simon Hart</b><br>Chief executive,<br>Countryside Alliance</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Patrick Wintour rightly highlights concerns about increasing parliament's remoteness from the public (A breach too far threatens openness, September 16). The most commonly expressed frustration revealed by visitors to the Hansard Society's recent Westminster Hall exhibition was that they felt unwelcome at Westminster. Physical barriers are not just about security but impact on how citizens relate to their democracy. </p> <p>While it is imperative that all those working in parliament should feel secure, the greatest strength of British democracy is its openness and accessibility. It would be a blow for our political system if Wednesday's events provoked measures that would have the effect of turning parliament into a fortress.

I'm now perfectly satisfied that the government believes this threat is minimal, if it exists at all.<br><b>Jaimie Grant</b><br>Manchester </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Whatever one thinks of chasing foxes, the actions of the five who ran into the Commons chamber demonstrated a huge contempt for parliament.

The trouble is, when those in power use it for a cynical and mendacious agenda, lower mortals will believe it is all right for them to do the same.

Harrington's second, a fragile chip, was oh-so-close to nestling in the white, leaving Monty a chance to have a real crack at his birdie putt. Mickelson's birdie attempt pulls up just short, so Monty can win it... but he underhits it and they move to the 14th still two up. Just five to play now. </p> <p>Nick Sebo has sent, potentially, the email of the day. \"Is it true that Elin Nordegren has a twin sister Josephin?\" Having checked on Google, I can tell you that she does. Marvellous. It'll be hard to concentrate on the golf now.</p> <p><strong>4.40pm:</strong> Luke Donald is playing much better now. Though he is still struggling to make putts, at least he is beginning to make birdie opportunities. He secures a par at the 11th to maintain the equilibrium in the third match. That one should go down to the wire.</p> <p>And now a rant. I know it has been said many times before, but it is so irritating when the American crowds scream out \"get in the hole\" every time Tiger hits the ball. They could at least wait until the ball hits the green rather than shout these fateful words as soon as the ball has left the tee. Argh!</p> <p>\"Gareth Radford is confusing me. The 'geeky one' from the Chemical brothers? As opposed to what?\" says a bewildered Mark Hooper.</p> <p><strong>4.34pm:</strong> Latest scores: </p> <p>Montgomerie/Harrington 2 up Mickelson/Woods (12) <br> Clarke/Jimenez 5 up Love/Campbell (11) <br> McGinley/Donald A/S Riley/Cink (10) <br> Garcia/Westwood 4 up Toms/Furyk (9)</p> <p><strong>4.30pm:</strong> Neither Woods nor Mickelson can make a birdie at the par-five fifth, which really should have been in their favour given its length, but Harrington can. Europe two up again.</p> <p>David Toms' putt for a half at the ninth travels all the way around the lip of the hole before deciding to be difficult and stay out. What a shame. No, really. Sergio taps in for his par and increases Europe's lead to four holes after the front nine.</p> <p>Duncan Cooper, our Swedish correspondent, says: \"\"Can I be the 30th person to point out that Elin Nordegren's mum is a Cabinet minister in Sweden?\" 'Fraid not, as you are in fact the first. \"She's Barnbro Holmberg, Minister for Migration and Asylum Policy.\"</p> <p><strong>4.26pm:</strong> Harrington matches Monty's approach shot, playing a terrific third at the par-five to a couple of feet from the pin.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Clarke and Jimenez are now five up after the Spaniard with the porn-star looks made yet another birdie. If this was a strokeplay event, Europe would have eight of the top 10 players. Then again, if this was an individual strokeplay event, the Americans probably wouldn't be playing with such mediocrity.</p> <p><strong>4.21pm:</strong> Big Phil has hit his drive at the 12th so far wide it's almost in one of the beer tents. Like Monty's earlier, maybe it was on purpose. His second hit a tree. Big Phil isn't having the best time. Monty, meanwhile, well Monty is just putting the other three in his group to shame. A majestic approach shot for the Scot leaves him with an almost certain birdie.</p> <p>Luke Donald has finally sunk a putt, and what an important one it was, saving the tenth hole. </p> <p>With regards to the US captain removing his cowboy hat, John McClure says: \"Sutton has obviously heard about Monty's 'playing better without my hat' theory.\" Yep, that'll be it.</p> <p><strong>4.13pm:</strong> Strange goings-on on the 11th green. Monty for some reason picked up his ball rather than putting and taking the pressure off Harrington. Padraig proceeded to miss his putt short, allowing Mickelson to tie the hole.</p> <p>Jimenez and Clarke have halved the tenth with Love and Campbell, and McGinley and Donald remain locked in a tight battle with Riley and Cink around the turn. </p> <p>Garcia and Westwood are now on the eighth green, and Sergio has a putt to win the hole after a great long shot froma farirway bunker... it hits the lip of the hole and fails to drop. Westwood has a little chuckle with his Spanish partner - the duo really have become bosom-buddies. Jim Furyk, he of the strange swing and the even stranger nose, hits his putt straight as an arrow to halve the hole with a par.</p> <p>Several of you have pointed out that the Davis Loves were indeed golfers, and I have appointed Catherine Brodigan as your spokeswoman: \"His dad was a golf teacher. Apparently there's also a Davis Love IV (heaven help us) who is now 11 and no doubt being groomed for Ryder Cup 2020.\" Crikey. Phil Swainston's idea is less likely but probably more entertaining: \"Maybe Davis Love Davis LoveII and Davis Love III are brothers of parents from some cybernetic research Co. and maybe they stopped at Davis Love IX.\" </p> <p><strong>4.06pm:</strong> Hal Sutton has had his first on-course interview. Having lost the cowboy hat (this is getting serious now, you know), Sutton accepted that the Europeans are simply playing brilliantly.</p> <p>Gareth Radford has some suspicions: \"Are Elin Nordegren and the geeky one from the Chemical Brothers the same person? Have they ever been seen in the same room together? I think we should be told.\" Anyone?</p> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> Both Garcia and Furyk have seen long putts slip agonisingly past the hole on the seventh, which is duly halved. So far the Americans have only won four holes, and three of those have been in the top match.</p> <p>Monty has played his first bad shot, though it may, just may, have been intentional. It went carerring off the fairway towards the crowd, and towards one woman in particular... Elin Nordegren. The blonde beauty leapt from her position on the ground, as did her skirt, which was swiftly pulled back down to her knees. A message from the Scot to Woods if ever there was one. Harrington proceeds to knock his approach 10 feet short of the pin.</p> <p>Paul Hebert thinks he knows why Monty is playing so well, excusing the last shot: \"Monty's man breasts don't seem the slightest bit smaller, and as a scratch golfer with man breasts myself, Monty needs them big to keep his swing plane on line! That is why he is playing so well.\"</p> <p>Allan Knox has an alternative theory: \"For the past few years Monty has been contractually obliged to wear a visor/baseball cap whatever. Ever since he has done this, his strength on the tour have declined. Well, in the Ryder Cup he doesn't have to wear a hat.\" Ah, I see.</p> <p><strong>3.53pm:</strong> Latest scores:</p> <p>Montgomerie/Harrington 1 up Mickelson/Woods (10) <br> Clarke/Jimenez 4 up Love/Campbell (9) <br> McGinley/Donald A/S Riley/Cink (8) <br> Garcia/Westwood 3 up Toms/Furyk (7)</p> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> Woods misses his putt for a par, and now Big Phil is going through his strange pre-putt routine of standing a long way from the hole and picturing a practice putt go in. But it seems to work, and so Europe remain just one up.</p> <p>Quadruple that scoreline in the second match, where Jimenez has just holed a close putt to extend Europe's lead. In the third match though, Europe's lead has evaporated, with neither Donald nor McGinley able to match Riley's birdie.</p> <p>Nick Temple writes: \"Do you know if Davis Love and Davis Love II were golfers too? And did they look like they were bullied at school?\" I wish I did know, Nick, but I don't. More than likely though.</p> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> Chris Riley has played a beautiful approach at the eighth and has only a gimme left. Either McGinley or Donald will have to hole to maintain their advantage. It's high time Donald did his part.</p> <p>On the tenth green, with Monty and Harrington only able to manage pars, Mickelson has a putt for the win... he aims it miles out to the right... it doesn't swing... it still doesn't swing... it passes the hole... and then it swings. Poor old Phil is made to look like a bit of a fool, and now both he and Tiger have tough putts for par.</p> <p>Pasha Bakhtia asks: \"Do you know if Phil is using the Nike ball during the four-ball or is he playing the Callaway?\" I'm afraid I don't Pasha, and I also don't know what make socks Davis Love is wearing.</p> <p><strong>3.37pm:</strong> Jim Furyk has made his team's first birdie. The pressure is now on Sergio to make his putt to halve... and he does. And then he does a rather funny hand jig with Westwood, similar to the one that Ryan Giggs and Paul Ince used to do when one of them scored for Manchester United.</p> <p>It's all going off. Darren Clarke now has a chance to win the eighth hole... but it dribbles past. Still, he and Jimenez are three up and Europe are up in all the games. Phew, this is exciting stuff. </p> <p><strong>3.31pm:</strong> The first real example of how tricky these greens can be. Monty, from a perilous position in the bunker, plays his shot supremely right next to the hole. It seemed to stop, but the US crowd must have all blown together, and it started rolling again until it was twenty feet from the pin. Monty can't make the putt, and neither can Harrington, so the US win the hole with a par. They are one down at the turn. </p> <p>Stewart Cink has made a birdie with a 25-footer. Until that point, Woods and Mickelson were the only Americans to have played a hole under par. But hold on, yer man Paul McGinley has made another sweeping putt, and they remain one up. </p> <p>\"I see Chris Riley is the self-styled US team joker,\" begins Jonathan Wood, somehwat sarcastically I suspect. \"Davis Love's example of his wackiness was when Chris tried to get as many people as possible in the hotel elevator. Crazy guy. Perhaps the Chuckle Brothers could launch a new career Stateside.\"</p> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> David Toms misses a short putt which would have clawed a hole back for he and Furyk. Westwood makes no mistake to square the hole.</p> <p>In the top match, three of the four players are in the bunker at the 220-yard ninth, with Woods' ball looking a little lonely near the hole.</p> <p>\"By the by, what do you do,if you are an Irishman working/living in Canada and decide to take Canadian citzenship thus being required to take an oath of allegiance to the Queen. Say it in Irish?\" I don't know, Niall O'Keeffe, this is all getting very complicated.</p> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> Latest scores:</p> <p>Montgomerie/Harrington 2 up Mickelson/Woods (8) <br> Clarke/Jimenez 3 up Love/Campbell (7) <br> McGinley/Donald 1 up Riley/Cink (6) <br> Garcia/Westwood 3 up Toms/Furyk (4)</p> <p><strong>3.18pm:</strong> Woods is first to putt... he misses. Misses by a long way too - that's certainly not dead. Harrington next... in it goes! A corker from 20 feet. Now Mickelson to halve from 15 feet... nope, it trickles past. Harrington wins the hole despite being in the worst position off the tee.</p> <p>Paul McGinley lands the first birdie in his match, Riley misses the chance to equal him, and Europe are now up in all four matches.</p> <p>\"I can't decide whether Mrs Mickleson looks like Monica Lewinsky or (more alarmingly) Phil himself,\" says Alex Webster. \"Either way, I reckon the European lasses have got to be in with a shout.\" So have the European men at this rate.</p> <p><strong>3.13pm:</strong> All four players in the top match are on the eighth green in two shots, but it's the Americans who will fancy themselves for their putts more. Or is that just fancy themselves more. </p> <p> \"In response to Barry O'Connell's jibe at Monty's chins, this may have been true at The Belfry but now he's obviously got rid of the man breasts to have a crack at Tiger's bird,\" explains Luke Burdess. \"The way Monty's playing he definitely has a chance... of winning his match.\"</p> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Westwood has a putt for a birdie on the fourth... and in it goes. He and Sergio have started where they left off at The Belfry, and are now three up. Over on the fifth, Chris Riley has made a steady putt for par, so the third match remains gridlocked at all square.</p> <p>Jimeneze and Campbell both have holeable birdie putts on the seventh green.</p> <p>\"That comment about Monty's chins obviously came from a very uneducated gentleman, as if he'd read The Guardian yesterday he would have noted that Monty has lost 38lbs over the last month and is at his lowest fighting weight for quite some time,\" says Ross Campbell. \"Besides there will be enough negative comments from the Yanks without us getting involved.\" Yeah, fair point, Ross, though the negative comments seem to be no skin off Monty's back. Though come to think of it, maybe that's the explanation for his weight loss.</p> <p><strong>2.59pm:</strong> A brave effort, but Monty couldn't quite hole his long putt. Europe give Mickelson his, the USA are back to one down. What a match this is proving to be - every hole has been won by a birdie. And big Phil has just swung his arm around Monty - what a top guy he is. If only he was European.</p> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> Andrew Jackson wonders: \"With Clarke and Jimenez two up after four is there any sign of them sparking up the big habanas yet?\" Well, now that they're three up after five, there could be. Staying on the Jimenez theme, Kevin gannon has an apology: \"Ok, forget my earlier comments about Jimenez and his unique hair. I now bow down before the Divine Ponytail.\"\"</p> <p><strong>2.52pm:</strong> The third match is now all square after four holes, and the Europeans are two up after three in the fourth match after Sergio holed out from five feet for a nervy par.</p> <p>Mickelson has played a brilliant second to the seventh green and has a tap-in. Monty will have to hole from fifteen feet or Harrington chip in from the rough to halve.</p> <p>Ian Barry writes: \"I have translated God Save the Queen into Irish if anyone is interested!\" Suzy Byrne?</p> <p><strong>2.47pm:</strong> Latest scores:</p> <p>Montgomerie/Harrington 2 up Mickelson/Woods (6) <br> Clarke/Jimenez 3 up Love/Campbell (5) <br> McGinley/Donald A/S Riley/Cink (3) <br> Garcia/Westwood 2 up Toms/Furyk (2)</p> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong> Jimenez is on fire. He's played another exceptional approach shot, this time to the fifth. He doesn't need to putt though as Clarke finds the hole from 25 feet. That's two birdies and an eagle for the Ulsterman. With Love missing his long birdie putt, Europe are three up.</p> <p>Over to the sixth green, on which all the players are struggling. Mickelson merely nudges his ball, but it still travels about thirty feet, about ten feet of which was past the hole. Monty's would have gone off the green if it hadn't gone in, but it did go in! Five birdies in six holes for Monty. Woods misses, and Europe are two up again.</p> <p> Warren Green observes: \"Just seen a picture of Clarke's barnet. Absolutely shocking. He looks like a fat Billy Idol.\" Quite. Oh, and I've just spilt my yoghurt all down me amid the excitement of it all.</p> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> Clarke and Jimenez have snatched the fourth hole and are two up after the Americans fell to pieces on the green. Love is not proving the steady-eddie everyone thinks he is.</p> <p>And over on the second green, the glad tidings keep coming in for Europe. Westwood has nailed his ten-footer to put he and Garcia two up. </p> <p>Barry O'Connell has some advice for Harrington's partner after they lost the last hole: \"Keep your chins up, Monty.\"</p> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> Harrington and Monty have lost a hole, as neither could even make par. Woods and Mickelson both had excellent birdie opportunities, but neither was made to putt for the hole. </p> <p>Stewart Cink has missed a putt to putt his pairing one up on McGinley and Donald at the third. The European pair are yet to fire there. </p> <p>Rob Deeming asks: \"MCan you give an update, to those of us not near a TV, as to the status of Bernhard's mullet today? Pristine, one can only assume.\" it was in excellent condition at the start of play, but the breeze is getting up in Detroit to speeds of 25-30mph, and so not only affecting the play of the players, but also Bern-Hard (as Sutton called him repeatedly last night). The mullet is looking somewhat windswept.</p> <p><strong>2.22pm:</strong> Furyk missed his putt so Garcia and Westwood are one up after one. The duo were very successful at the Belfry two years ago, winning three of their four matches. With McGinley and Donald halving the second hole, Europe are now up in three of the matches and all square in the other. What a start. For those looking for a scoreboard: (number of holes played in brackets)</p> <p>Montgomerie/Harrington 2 up Mickelson/Woods (4) <br> Clarke/Jimenez 1 up Love/Campbell (3) <br> McGinley/Donald A/S Riley/Cink (2) <br> Garcia/Westwood 1 up Toms/Furyk (1)</p> <p><strong>2.16pm:</strong> Monty has sunk another birdie - that's three in four for him, and four in four for he and his partner. Mickelson missed his putt, so there was massive pressure on Woods, but the great man didn't let it show - he holes out to halve the hole. People will be critical of Woods and Mickelson if they don't win, but there's only so much you can do when the opposition is birdieing every hole.</p> <p>Sergio Garcia is off to a flyer with a birdie at the first. Furyk must now hole his 10-foot putt to keep their match all square. Less good news for Donald though. The rookie is looking a little nervy, and he has followed his poor first hole with three disappointing shots at the second. McGinley will have to work hard to keep them all square.</p> <p>Clarke and Jimenez are one up after the first three holes after the Ulsterman secured his eagle at the second.</p> <p><strong>2.06pm:</strong> Monty has had his first interaction with the crowd, demanding one intrusive spectator to keep still. Breathe, Monty, breathe. All four players are on the fourth green with birdie putts.</p> <p>The Americans are starting to hit back. Jim Furyk has played a fine approach to the first, and is in with the best chance of a birdie of his fourball. Chad Campbell, meanwhile, has hit his tee-shot at the third to within a few feet of the pin.</p> <p>Matthew Crudgington requests: \"Michael, can you talk about the state of the course, especially the greens and rough?\" I can indeed. They're in impeccable shape. The greens are, well, just that, while the fairways look like the greens we have over this side of the pond. The rough is also accommodating, hardly a hazard at all. The greens do look a tricky prospect, mind you, as Phil Mickelson's putt at the first demonstrated. His stroke was slightly underhit, and the ball did not quite make the top level, rolling back down the slope about fifteen to twenty feet.</p> <p> <strong>2pm:</strong> Woods misses his birdie putt, as does Mickelson. Harrington makes no mistake, though, firmly knocking his ball into the middle of the hole. Those cries of \"U S A\" are sounding a bit hollow now. The dream team of Mickelson and Woods is something of a nightmare at the moment, but there's a long way to go.</p> <p>Match three is all square after one hole with McGinley playing a beautiful chipped third shot to secure a four for Europe.</p> <p>Darren Clarke has played a great second shot at the second hole, and has a real chance for an eagle. With Chad Campbell missing his eagle putt, Clarke can win the hole here.</p> <p>\"Can you help my golfing friend Commander Jennifer Flather of the US Navy based in Washington DC?\" I'll do my best, Allan Knox. \"She needs a date, preferably a single golfing male who has his own tuxedo? I suggested Monty, but has anyone got any better suggestions?\"</p> <p><strong>1.54pm:</strong> Mickelson has been very unlucky on the par-three third, hitting the flag. The ball bounced on about fifteen feet away. Woods is also in with a birdie shout, but Harrington's ball lies just five feet from the hole.</p> <p>Colin Huxtable argues: \"I fancy Miguel 'the mullet from La Mancha' Jimenez to be Europe's star player. Anyone with the nerve to sport a follicle formation like that has the requisite nerve to sink bum-clenching five footers.\" Too right.</p> <p><strong>1.47pm:</strong> Jimenez misses his putt, so the first hole is halved.</p> <p>Now for Monty... his putt slides agonisingly past the hole. Woods holes for a four, and the hole is halved with birdies.</p> <p>Donald and McGinley have begun their match, with Langer making his first appearance on the first hole, having a chat with the English rookie. Stewart Cink is in prime position after a cracking drive down the middle of the fairway. Donald's second was hit with a very tricky stance, and has landed right of the green.</p> <p>\"Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jimenez - both haircuts are quite unique. Their hair alone should be worth a point, no?\" ponders kevin Gannon, generously offering the European pair the award for worst barnet. Let's wait to see what Ian Poulter looks like later, shall we?</p> <p><strong>1.40pm:</strong> Harrington and Monty have again hit marvellous approach shots and both have eagle opportunities. With Mickelson in a bunker and Woods through the back of the green, could it be two holes to Europe?</p> <p>On the first green, Jimenez has a putt from about 12 feet to put Europe one up.</p> <p>Ravi Motha makes a fine point. \"Since Tiger likes playing alone, maybe that why he is rumoured to have split up with Elin Nordegren. All I can say is fabulously wealthy but a fool.\"</p> <p><strong>1.30pm:</strong> The second fourball produces similarly poor drives, with the exception of the admirably calm Jimenez, who plonks his ball in the middle of the fairway. The Spaniard follows that up with a second to 12 feet from the pin. Clarke is just off the front of the green, Love is in stuck in a greenside bunker, and Campbell's shot was equally untroubling to the hole.</p> <p>In the first match, all the players are either on the fairway or in the slight rough after their drives. </p> <p><strong>1.27pm:</strong> First blood to Europe! Monty knocks his putt in and Europe are one up. By Monty's own logic, that really ought to make them two up.</p> <p>\"I know that it's raining at Southampton at the moment, but could you not combine the live cricket and golf coverage making it easier for people who want to follow both,\" says Geoff maguire. I'm afraid I only have one pair of eyes, one pair of ears and one pair of hands, so click above for the cricket coverage!</p> <p><strong>1.20pm:</strong> Monty has launched his ball to around six or seven feet from the pin. What is it about the Ryder Cup that brings out the best in him? Harrington has also played a fine shot, leaving himself a 12-foot birdie putt. Woods did well to find the green but faces a very long putt, while Mickelson's second also ended in a similar spot. If one of the two Europeans can hole out, they will almost certainly be one up.</p> <p><strong>1.15pm:</strong> The pressure has certainly told - all four players have missed the opening fairway. Monty and Harrington are both in the sand, one on each side of the farway, while Woods and Mickelson will also be separating, with each player thrashing his ball into the crowds. Well they do say Woods prefers to go alone when he's playing anyway. The Europeans have a slight advantage because the bunkers are fairly tepid.</p> <p>Robert Pink asks: \"I know this might not be the most obvious question, but which team has the best-looking set of wives? Now that Monty's better half has plumped for Hugh Grant I'm willing to put my cash on the Yanks.\" I'll reserve judgment until I have seen all 24, as such a question should not be answered without thorough research. But the Americans are the early favourites in that regard.</p> <p><strong>1.05pm:</strong> For anyone interested, Robert Simpson offers his predictions for the opening matches: \"Reckon we will lose the top match but win the other three.\" My opinion, for what it's worth (hardly anything, I know), but I reckon the top match wil be halved, Jimenez and Clarke will win the next match, McGinley and Donald will lose to Riley and Cink, and Toms and Furyk will halve with Garcia and Westwood to leave the scores level.</p> <p>Here's a stat to boost European hopes: the European players have won more world ranking points (273) than the Americans (237) in the last month. So they're certainly the team in form. But will all that go out of the window when Monty hits the first shot? We're about to find out...</p> <p><strong>1pm:</strong>\"Anyone else feel the horrible silence all the way from Detroit as Sutton referred to two of his players as 'Cripples' as they'd had a bit of wrist surgery. Is he the new Glenda Hoddle?\" Phil Godwin queries. I did, Phil, and there was another awful silence when Sutton tried to make a gag about how diligent Langer is. He chuckled at his own joke, but sadly nobody else did. Highly entertaining viewing.</p> <p>Suzy Byrne was less pleased with what she witnessed. \"Consternation growing here (in Ireland) about last nights opening ceremony and the fact that the Irish Anthem was sung in English by a man from Belfast who has lived in Detroit for 15 years... There were enough Irish people in the crowd who knew the anthem who could have sung it! Maybe it will rile Paddy and Paul enough to go out and whip those Yanks.\" Let's hope so. </p> <p>Incidentally, the American team are wearing disappointingly conservative grey slipovers and blue shirts with a little bit of red and white. Surely they have something better lined up for the weekend.</p> <p><strong>12.50pm:</strong> We're moving ever closer to the big tee-off, and the players are starting to look a little nervous on the range.</p> <p>But enough of that. \"What of the important issues? What colour are the shirts?\" John McClure wants to know. Well, John, the Amercian players have barely been featured so an answer will follow for them, but the European team are wearing rather dismal black and grey shirts and sleeveless pullovers. Hal Sutton is also sporting a rather ridiculous cowboy hat to prove his Americanness. The wives have not been seen yet.</p> <p>Sky are currently doing a ridiculous version of our veryown Small Talk, asking players questions such as their middle names (Toms - Wayne), what they wash first in the shower (Clarke - unspeakable), what's their favourite animal (Tiger - Tiger), and whether they have ever played the bagpipes (Garcia - what are bagpipes?) Oh, and Colin Montgomerie has just informed everyone that he doesn't wear pyjamas. Now there's one for our lady readers.</p> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> Monty has just claimed that if he and Harrington can beat Mickelson and Woods in the first match, \"it will literally be worth two points to Europe for the remainder of the week\". Now, am I missing something here? Has there been a change of rules I don't know about? </p> <p>Either way, it certainly is an important match, as is the second. Langer has not missed a trick there by pairing the experienced duo of Miguel Angel Jimenez and Darren Clarke. With McGinley and Donald, and Garcia and Westwood, who were such a formidable team at The Belfry two years ago, to follow, Europe look well positioned to take an advantage this morning. </p> <p>\"Was that perhaps the tackiest opening ceremony ever produced or does my memory coveniently allow me to forget similar ones in years past?\" asks Guy Allen, to which I can only reply in the affirmative. \"I can't believe we have ever seen a US or European captain tell us how much he loves his wife, forget how many kids he has, then succomb to the lower chin wobble as practised by Gazza and Mathew Pinsent.\" </p> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> Welcome to Oakland Hills, Michigan, where the start of the 2004 Ryder Cup is not far away. It's actually only seven o'clock in Detroit, indeed the sun is only just beginning to show itself, so some of the early-rising players are entering the clubhouse now for their pre-match greasy fry-ups (Paul McGinley and Jay Haas), while others are putting on the practice green (Tiger Woods and Padraig Harrington). </p> <p>The European team has won three of the last four Ryder Cups, so the Americans are quite rightly \"psyched\" for this one. Captain Hal Sutton, who last night seemed to think the opening ceremony was actually a tribute to himself when he thanked the USGA, his wife, his mum, dad, friends and goldfish or his appointment as skipper, has certainly thrown down a marker to his counterpart Bernard Langer.</p> <p>Sutton has put out his two best players, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods, in the very first match in a bid to win the first point for the Stars and Stripes. But the wily German has matched his opponent by pairing his finest player, Harrington, with his most experienced, Colin Montgomerie. </p> <p>Monty has lost just two of his last 16 Ryder Cup matches and it is he who will hit this year's first drive. It promises to be an absolute cracker on the course named \"The Monster\".</p> <p>The pairings for the opening four-balls, kicking off in an hour's time, are: </p> <p>1.10pm: Mickelson/Woods v Montgomerie/Harrington <br> 1.25pm: Love/Campbell v Clarke/Jimenez <br> 1.40pm: Riley/Cink v McGinley/Donald <br> 1.55pm: Toms/Furyk v Garcia/Westwood</p>",

  "<p>An independent university in Belarus was closed down last month because it was increasingly seen as a threat to the authorities, according to its rector.</p> <p>Professor Anatoly Mikhailov told EducationGuardian.co.uk that the closure of the European Humanities University in Minsk, the country's only private institution with state-recognised status, was \"because our influence was recognised [as] dangerous\" to the education system and to the country's president, Alexander Lukashenko, who observers claim is pushing for greater control of the former communist state.</p> <p>The university, which was largely funded by the west and received visiting professors from across Europe and the US, was forced out of its premises and had its education license revoked by the authorities on August 5. The move followed months of pressure on Professor Mikhailov to resign his post.</p> <p>\"Having nothing at all, being forced to collect money for our registration, we were able to create in a relatively short time probably the most internationally recognised university in Belarus in social sciences and humanities, where almost everything was dominated and destroyed by the communist ideology,\" said the professor. </p> <p>\"We were having very prestigious programmes with Germany, France, [the] US and other countries, while using various foreign languages as languages of instruction, and became very attractive for our students, who understood that in other [higher education] institutions they would receive only slightly modified content of the previous communist ideology.\"</p> <p>Professor Mikhailov said his contact with prominent politicians and scientists in the west, and his receipt of two prestigious academic awards, including the French Order of Palmes Academiques last year, prompted rumours that he would oppose president Lukashenko in the next elections. \"I never thought about it and never had such ambitions, but how could I prove it?\" he said.</p> <p>The university was established in 1992 with a mission to train a new generation to play a greater role in the democratic development of Belarus following years of communist rule.</p> <p>Over the past year its western leanings have increasingly been at odds with a government that is cracking down on dissenting voices. Last month a state television channel was reportedly closed for supposedly exaggerating details of an anti-government demonstration.</p> <p>In March, president Lukashenko called for reforms in education to strengthen the government's position in the sector, saying that a \"battle for the minds of our people\" was occurring in the country.</p> <p>Academics from across Europe have condemned the closure of EHU as an attack on academic freedom.</p> <p>Professor Noel Whelan, president of the European University Foundation, a network of 16 institutions across Europe, said the forced closure was a severe loss to the \"democratic and intellectual potential of Belarus\".</p> <p>In a letter to the country's ministry of education earlier this year, Professor Whelan expressed the foundation's \"deep concerns\" about the pressure the government was putting on the rector and the university, which it called a \"committed member\" of the EUF.</p> <p>\"This pressure runs counter to the essential democratic value of academic freedom and, by extension, runs counter to the best interests of Belarus as it develops itself within the international community,\" he wrote.</p> <p>Last week, Professor Whelan, vice-president of the University of Limerick in Ireland, told EducationGuardian.co.uk that the university's closure would be discussed at the foundation's next assembly meeting in October, which Professor Mikhailov is expected to attend.</p> <p>In the meantime it has written to member universities calling on them to accommodate EHU students.</p>",

  "<p>As soon as Insider's private 747 touched the tarmac, she grabbed her champagne flute and her platform Terry de Havillands and ran. And a good thing, too, as this week truly was, to sully one's prose with tabloid argot, \"a veritable star-studded bonanza\". At <strong> Zac Posen</strong>'s predictably paparazzi-pleasing show, a fellow member of the British fashion pack did his noble best to attract the attentions of Stephen \"who?\" Dorff without (a) knowing who he was and (b) realising that Dorff's tastes lie more on the straight and narrow. Still, good to see that British can-do attitude always in evidence. </p> <p>Backstage sounded even more eventful: poor wee Zac had a fashion crisis at the rehearsal when all of his shoes for the show, er, broke. So he put in a quickie call to fairy godmother Anna Wintour who obligingly sent over every spare pair in the fashion cupboard. Ain't life sweet when you're flavour of the moment? </p> <p>Next, on to the <strong> Marc Jacobs</strong> show: hi, Liv! Hey Kate Hudson! How's it hangin', J-Lo (who, Insider can report after careful inspection, does not have a big bum, just a weirdly small waist)? At the waaaaay too packed afterparty, arty folk Sam Taylor-Wood and Rachel Feinstein seemed to be taking one another very seriously over the Atkins-friendly hors d'oeuvres. </p> <p>Despite much excited talk about the presence of Sienna Miller and Jude Law in New York this week, neither deigned to grace the fashion shows with their presence, forcing Insider to ponder at length the significance of both Anna Wintour and Elizabeth Saltzman wearing long pearl ropes with crewneck sweaters. But Insider did pick up a useful tip from a friend on how to talk to Tatler and Heat's favourite couple: don't make any sign that you recognise either because Insider's friend made this foolish error only to be then informed by Ms Miller (22 yrs and precocious with it) that she \"really hates it when people do that as it really creeps her out!\" To which the only possible reply is, well, don't hang out at Soho House in MePa (that's the meatpacking district to you) with Jude Law, you silly sausage, but sadly, Insider was not present to make that point clear to the misguided child. </p> <p>Best front row of the week goes to <strong> Calvin Klein</strong> when Insider sat opposite (deep breath) Ashley Olsen (of Olsen twins \"fame\", who is amazingly skinny considering she is not even the one who is anorexic), Mandy Moore, Vincent Gallo and Elizabeth Taylor - classy types, one and all. Ashley seemed to view the event as live action QVC, indicating different dresses to Mandy and informing her that she \"loves it\" and \"wants it\", simultaneously shaking her head in wonder, like a grand dowager stunned by the beauty of a Renoir oil painting. Ashley is 18, incidentally. Our Liz, meanwhile, was taking a similar approach, pointing to frocks to the man sitting next to her (stylist? GBF? Who knows?) for his approval, which he rarely gave, pointing her in other (and suspiciously wrong) directions. Liz, honey, take it from Insider: stick with the green gown. The orange one would do you no favours. </p> <p>For the last night, Insider was positively deluged with offers: would it be the Calvin Klein dinner? Or maybe the Ghost one at Indochine? The Narciso Rodriguez party, perhaps? At last, Insider decided to grant the boys from Another magazine with her presence at their dinner at Fredericks, an exclusive new club to which admittance is granted not by membership card, but by fingerprint scanning. Only in New York, kids. Zac Posen was there in his favourite pirate jacket, as was Natalie Portman, looking beautiful but tiny, like all proper celebrities do. Bj\u00f6rk also turned up in a white satin bodysuit and Jeremy Scott revealed what he's been up to for the past four years: plaiting his hair and winding it about his scalp. Sadly, the three salad leaves with soy sauce did not suffice for Insider so she had to leave to raid the minibar. Thank god for $8 Snickers bars.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> I am a ceramics and textiles specialist and currently working as a curator for a local but international gallery. I am due to retire in five years' time but find myself frustrated and limited by my surroundings. I would really like to freelance but have no idea how to market myself in such a specialised environment. How do I build up my contacts and keep the money coming in? Can you prepare to freelance while you're still in a full-time job or do you have to take the plunge and start afresh?</p> <p><strong>A</strong> The good news is that it is possible to hold on to your regular job to keep the money coming in, while following your dream to go freelance. But it will need a great deal of planning. Do not be too hasty to give up your full-time job until you have researched all your options. Freelance working is a lonely treadmill, without much financial security or social interaction. But what you gain is freedom to do the work you will enjoy without having to answer to bosses. </p> <p>However independence and freedom to select whom to work with, when and where, comes at a price. Cutting loose from the comfort zone of full-time employment, means that you are responsible for keeping your tax and national insurance contributions up to date. This is even more important in your case as you are within spitting distance of retirement. Until the venture starts to generate enough cash to support you and it looks certain to do so in the near future, it is prudent not to lose a guaranteed source of income. </p> <p>There are several useful websites that you might want to search through to see if your skills in ceramics and textiles are marketable: <a href=\"http://www.smarterwork.com\">smarterwork</a>, <a href=\"http://www.homeworkinguk.com\"> homeworkinguk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ownbase.com/\">ownbase</a>. Also your local Business Link, the government-backed help and advice service for small businesses may offer free business planning workshops. Your local <a href=\"http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/home\"> reference library </a> will have the contact details. </p> <p>You might want to check out a book aimed at people considering a freelance career, Successfully Going Freelance in a Week by Brian Holmes. The book provides a practical guide to setting up your own business, and focuses on the hard questions of motivation and suitability to take this life-changing decision. </p> <p>I am not clear about what do you mean when you say that you are a ceramics and textiles specialist. Assuming that you are a designer, you may want to contact <a href=\"http://www.creativepeople.org.uk/\">CreativePeople</a>; a national network of organisations that deliver training, professional development, advice and guidance to aspiring arts and crafts practitioners.

  "<p>Ryan Sim sits in the shop doorway wrapped in a frayed sleeping bag. A torn cup with a few coppers sits in front of him. He's been there for three hours and won't leave for many more. He hopes he'll get enough money for a B&amp;B tonight, but he doubts it. Not now. </p> <p>It used to be possible to make about \u00a320 a day begging on the streets of Aberdeen. Then the council announced it wanted to be the first in Scotland to outlaw begging. A local newspaper ran a story revealing most beggars were drug addicts. </p> <p>\"I've been kicked, spat on, sworn at since that came out,\" says Mr Sim, 21. </p> <p>\"Aye, most beggars may be drug addicts, but I'm no'. I'm here because I was evicted because of rent arrears. I just want to get somewhere to bide [live] and get myself a job.\" </p> <p>He reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a certificate, wrapped in plastic, folded in four. \"It's for fork-lift truck driving. I did a course a few months ago,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I phoned an oil company and a fish company and they said they were interested. Then I told them I was homeless and they said to call them back when I had somewhere to bide. When's that going to be, like?\" </p> <p>He has been homeless for more than a year. He can't get a place in a hostel; he says when he asks for temporary accommodation he's told to come back tomorrow. But he's given up hope. </p> <p>When he made enough money begging, he would get a B&amp;B. It costs \u00a325, but they would let him stay for \u00a315 if he cleaned rooms in the morning. For now, he still begs. But he's lucky if he gets \u00a35 or \u00a310 a day. So most nights he sleeps rough in car parks. \"I just want a job and somewhere to bide,\" he says. \"This is no' a life.\" </p> <p>Aberdeen does not seem the most obvious city in Scotland to push for a ban on street begging. Oil ensures the city consistently tops economic surveys as the wealthiest area of the country; only around 25 people beg regularly on the city's streets. </p> <p>But Aberdeen wants permission from the Scottish executive to be the first council in Scotland to introduce an all-out ban on street begging. </p> <p>\"The move to ban begging is not just a matter of getting these people off the streets, it's a response to a number of concerns from Aberdeen's citizens,\" says Martin Greig, of the Aberdeen community safety partnership. </p> <p>Although Aberdeen's problem with street begging is small compared with larger cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh, it is compounded by its layout. It has one main shopping thoroughfare, Union Street, and all the beggars can be found either on it, or within 100 metres of it. </p> <p>\"Although the problem is no worse than any other city in Scotland, it is very visible because it centres on Union Street,\" says Mr Greig. \"There have been a lot of complaints, some of them are about personal safety and intimidation, but many people are very genuinely worried about the beggars.\" </p> <p>Street begging is illegal in England and Wales, but not in Scotland. The only sanction police have is to charge beggars with breach of the peace, which is usually only used to tackle aggressive begging. </p> <p>But Aberdeen wants the executive to let it pass a bylaw which would make it illegal to beg anywhere in the city. </p> <p>The move is being watched by Scotland's other city councils. </p> <p>Edinburgh is reviewing its strategy for anti-social behaviour and, if Aberdeen is successful, it could follow suit. </p> <p>\"We take the issue of street begging seriously and will watch Aberdeen's experience with interest,\" said an Edinburgh council spokeswoman. Glasgow city council is also unhappy about its powers. A spokeswoman said the council had called for a change in the law on street begging. </p> <p>Aberdeen's move is backed by Grampian police, voluntary bodies and the local health authority. These groups have carried out three surveys into begging in the city and have found about half of those who beg are homeless, the average age is between 30 and 35, and up to 90% are male. Most have drug or alcohol problems, and up to 70% beg four days a week. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the executive said the police already had powers to deal with aggressive begging, but it would await Aberdeen's submission. </p> <p>Mr Sim says he knows what would happen if begging is banned. </p> <p>\"The crime rate will go through the roof,\" he says. \"I ken most of the beggars and they all say the same thing. They'll go back to breaking into houses or cars. I don't want to beg, sit here all day, but what else can I do?\"</p>",
  "<p>Evidence of prisoner abuse and possible war crimes at Guant\u00e1namo Bay reached the highest levels of the Bush administration as early as autumn 2002, but the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, chose to do nothing about it, according to a new investigation published by the veteran journalist Seymour Hersh. </p> <p>Hersh quotes one former marine at the camp recalling sessions in which guards would \"fuck with [detainees] as much as we could\" by inflicting pain on them. </p> <p>The Bush administration repeatedly assured critics that inmates were granted recreation periods, but one Pentagon adviser told Hersh how, for some prisoners, they consisted of being left in straitjackets in intense sunlight with hoods over their heads. </p> <p>Hersh provides details of how President George Bush signed off on the establishment of a secret unit that was given advance approval to kill or capture and interrogate \"high-value\" suspects - considered by many to be in defiance of international law - an officially \"unacknowledged\" programme that was eventually transferred wholesale from Guant\u00e1namo to the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. </p> <p>Hersh, who broke the story of the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam war, makes his revelations in a new book, Chain of Command , which leaves senior figures in the Bush administration far more seriously implicated in the torture scandal than had been previously apparent. </p> <p>A CIA analyst visited Guant\u00e1namo in summer 2002 and returned \"convinced that we were committing war crimes\" and that \"more than half the people there didn't belong there. He found people lying in their own faeces\", a CIA source told Hersh. </p> <p>The analyst submitted a report to General John Gordon, an aide to Mr Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. </p> <p>Gen Gordon was troubled and felt, one former administration official told Hersh, \"that if the actions at Guant\u00e1namo ever became public, it'd be damaging to the president\". </p> <p>Ms Rice saw the document the same year, and called a high-level meeting at which she asked Mr Rumsfeld to deal with the problem. But after he vowed to act, \"the Pentagon went into a full-court stall\". </p> <p>The investigation suggests that CIA and FBI staff had already witnessed incidents at Guant\u00e1namo just as extreme as those that would subsequently be alleged by freed inmates. </p> <p>A senior intelligence official told Hersh: \"I was told [by FBI agents] that the military guards were slapping prisoners, stripping them, pouring cold water over them and making them stand until they got hypothermia.\" </p> <p>The secret \"special access programme\" facilitating much of the mistreatment of prisoners - widely held to have contravened the Geneva convention - was established after a direct order from the president. </p> <p>Hersh reports that a secret document signed by Mr Bush in February 2002 stated: \"I determine that none of the provisions of Geneva apply to our conflict with al-Qaida in Afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world.\" </p> <p>Hersh's book reports that an army officer communicated concerns over abuses at Abu Ghraib both to General John Abizaid, the US central command (Centcom) chief at the time, and his deputy, General Lance Smith. The officer told Hersh: \"I said there are systematic abuses going on in the prisons. Abizaid didn't say a thing. He looked at me - beyond me, as if to say, 'Move on. I don't want to touch this'.\" Centcom disputes this. </p> <p>In a statement the Pentagon said Hersh's investigation \"apparently contains many of the numerous unsubstantiated allegations and inaccuracies which he has made in the past based upon unnamed sources . . . Thus far . . . investigations have determined that no responsible official of the Department of Defence approved any programme that could conceivably have authorised . . . the abuses seen at Abu Ghraib. If any of Mr Hersh's anonymous sources wish to . . . offer evidence to the contrary, the department welcomes them to do so.\" </p> <p>Pressure has been building on the Pentagon over its detention policies after it emerged at a congressional hearing last week that the administration is being accused of concealing up to 100 \"ghost detainees\" from the Red Cross. </p> <p>Mr Rumsfeld told reporters last Friday that he had approved the use of harsh interrogation measures, but that they had only been meant for Guant\u00e1namo. He said the measures ought to be contrasted with those of terrorists. \"Does it rank up there with chopping someone's head off on television?\" he asked. \"It doesn't.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>4pm</strong> That's it, folks. Play has been abandoned for the day at the Rose Bowl with England 118 for 3 from 32 overs. The match will resume, grey skies permitting, at 10.15 BST tomorrow morning. Thanks for all your emails. </p> <p><strong>3.50pm</strong> \"So Robert Lewis in Istanbul thinks living there gives him the right to be Turkey correspondent!\" fumes Wayne Trotman. \"Not! And if we're name-dropping then I should point out that I was once coached by Harold Rhodes and the late great Bill Voce. Actually I'm trying to get a team together here in Turkey so if Bob could get in touch somehow...\"</p> <p><strong>3.25pm</strong> Hello again strangers. The latest news from the Rose Bowl is that the covers are still on and drizzle is still in the air. Play for the day has not been called off yet, but it will certainly spill over into tomorrow's reserve day.</p> <p>Here's a little tale from Gabriel Munns to help pass the time. \"I had a similar, but more painful, experience to Finbar's. Also on a sub-Mumbai-an beach on Christmas eve 2001. A dauntless combined England/New Zealand VII fearlessly took on an all-India XXIV in scorching conditions with stumps rendered from dried palm leaves and a bat hewn with a penknife from a weighty chunk of wrecked fishing boat. Few runs were scored due to most protagonists inability to lift the bat. However, I took two diving catches fielding waist deep in the Indian Ocean way out on the Chagos Archipelago boundary, but in grasping the second landed squarely on a cricket-hating Sea Urchin, the spines of which are still embedded in my knee as a souvenir of that wonderful day. I was forced to leave the field and this further contribution to the already silly personnel advantage of the Indians, coupled with their sorcerous ability to conjure turn from the sand, meant we were soundly thrashed by seven runs. It all seems a long way from drizzly Southampton.\"</p> <p> <strong>2.25pm</strong> The rain has apparently stopped, but the Rose Bowl remains shrouded in gloom. More to the point, the whole place is soaking. I'd say there was a very real chance that we'll see no more play today.</p> <p>\"I find that whereas Pret's free sachets of salt have more than enough salt for my lunchtime snack,\" writes Simon Evans, \"the pepper sachets contain a fifth of the amount and I am often forced to utilise three or four sachets on my egg mayo. So come on Pret, fill your pepper sachets with a decent amount!\"</p> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> My spies tell me it's still raining in Southampton, which is all very miserable.</p> <p>Here's Finbar Anslow to cheer you up. \"Talking about Austrian cricket, you might be interested to know that in December 1992 we staged what was probably the first ever one-day international between Austria and Italy on a beach about a hundred miles south of Bombay. A major factor in the Austrian victory was when the entire Italian leg-side field decided to go for a swim!\"</p> <p><strong>1.32pm</strong> Still raining, which means England are stuck on 118 for 3 from 32 overs, with Trescothick on 64 and Flintoff on 21. Why not amuse yourselves by joining Mike Adamson's <a href=\"http://sport.theguardian.com/rydercup2004/story/0,15063,1306227,00.html\">live Ryder Cup commentary</a>? It's got to be better than my rain updates.</p> <p>\"Have you noticed that Pr\u00eat wraps often have far too much pepper in them?\" writes Edward Bannister, showing an impressive grasp of French accents. Mine was fine, Edward. Now the salt and pepper crisps, they're another matter.</p> <p> <strong>1.18pm</strong> As you might have gathered, it's still raining at the Rose Bowl, which has at least given me time to go out and pick up a tuna nicoise wrap from Pret. If that sounds all very Guardian, then I apologise.</p> <p>\"Patrick has a point,\" writes Phil Keegan. \"Graz is indeed one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, but the local Gasthauses tend to be rather dark and dingy on the inside. Also, the owner of the Irish bar in question (Flann O'Brien's) is a founding member of Graz Cricket Club.\" </p> <p><strong>12.44pm</strong> Right, with England 118 for 3 off 32 overs, I'm going to pop out for a bite to eat, because I don't think we'll have any play for another 20 minutes at the very least. Keep those emails coming in, mind. </p> <p><strong>12.38pm</strong> The rain has become too strong and the covers are now on. Pity.</p> <p>Patrick has a reasonable question. \"Can someone please tell me why you go all the way to one of Europe's most beautiful, interesting cities to spend time in an Irish bar?\" </p> <p><strong>32nd over: England 118-3 (Trescothick 64, Flintoff 21)</strong> Flintoff has been fairly subdued so far but the situation has demanded it. The old Freddie might have thrown it away by now. At the other end, Trescothick continues to anchor the innings with commendable restraint. Zoysa goes up for a caught-behind shout against Flintoff, but umpire Bowden remains unmoved, which must have required a certain restraint in itself.</p> <p>\"Tell Frazer Nock that prem football is freely available in Slovenia,\" writes Bob Higgins. \"They see more live broadcasts that we do. Should be no problem finding a bar. If he sees a short, shaven-headed bloke in an Arsenal shirt, or a Ljubljana Cricket Club top, ask him to say hello to Alasdair.\"</p> <p><strong>31st over: England 114-3 (Trescothick 62, Flintoff 19)</strong> Flintoff pushes Jayasuriya down the ground and hustles hard for two. A handful of singles make that a reasonable over for England, who can probably afford to work the ball around for another 10 overs or so before they go for the big hits.</p> <p>Some of you have come out in defence of Michael Vaughan. Here's Matthew Smith. \"You cannot replace class, and Vaughan is a class act Mr Marsden. Who are you going to replace him with? Runs Himself Rikki Clarke. I think not!\" I'm not sure that's a very helpful argument Matthew.</p> <p><strong>30th over: England 107-3 (Trescothick 59, Flintoff 15)</strong> That's the end of a superb spell by Maharoof, whose final figures are 10-1-19-1. Not bad for a 20-year-old playing only his 13th one-day international. Signs that Flintoff might be getting frustrated as he plays an ugly wipe that skews away to mid-on for a single.</p> <p><strong>29th over: England 104-3 (Trescothick 57, Flintoff 14)</strong> Jayasuriya enters the attack with his flat left-arm tweakers, but his first ball is a long hop and Freddie needs no second invitation: four runs over midwicket. Flintoff almost plays on via his pad moments later, but jams his bat between the ball and the stumps just in time. </p> <p>\"To your Slovenia-bound correspendent,\" writes Keith Dyer. \"I can tell him without having been near the place that his best option will be an Irish bar just off the main square.\" </p> <p><strong>28th over: England 100-3 (Trescothick 57, Flintoff 10)</strong> More thrift from Maharoof as the drizzle continues to fall. But up comes the England 100 with a scurried Flintoff single. It's been tough - but England might just be inching towards a total that should test Sri Lanka.</p> <p>\"Ed Airey's summer wedding tour has been more to do with finding the future Mrs Airey than anything else,\" claims Rob Jackson. \"Unfortunately he has now reached the stage where he has pulled or tried it on and failed (more frequently the latter) with every one of his female friends. And their friends. And most of the female population of Clapham. So perhaps a female over-by-over reader could take Ed out today and avoid him jinxing Freddie? Any offers?\" Just call me Cilla.</p> <p><strong>27th over: England 98-3 (Trescothick 56, Flintoff 9)</strong> It's raining. But the players soldier on manfully and Flintoff plays his first real stroke in anger, sweeping Chandana square and with real power for four. Billy Bowden is almost decapitated at square-leg. I wonder what his signal is for a stretcher. I'm certain he has one.</p> <p><strong>26th over: England 93-3 (Trescothick 55, Flintoff 5)</strong> Another tidy over by Maharoof, who has now bowled eight overs for just 14 runs. Trescothick keeps the strike with a work for one to long leg.</p> <p><strong>25th over: England 92-3 (Trescothick 54, Flintoff 5)</strong> Trescothick moves to his half-century with a well-controlled sweep for four off Chandana. It took him 74 balls of hard - and occasionally fortunate - graft, but it could prove priceless. Flintoff picks up two thanks to a bad misfield at backward point. Nine off the over and we've reached the halfway mark of England's innings. This game remains in the balance.</p> <p><strong>24th over: England 83-3 (Trescothick 48, Flintoff 2)</strong> Marvan Atapattu is rotating his bowlers here, and back comes the impressive Maharoof. Just one off the over.</p> <p>\"In order to avoid confusion, can you please remove the picture of Spike Lee from your home page,\" asks George Chamberlain. \"I was very disappointed when I realised he was talking about lesbians rather than providing over-by-over coverage of today's game.\" </p> <p><strong>23rd over: England 82-3 (Trescothick 47, Flintoff 2)</strong> On comes Upul Chandana, who bowls rolling leg-breaks, and he almost has Flintoff stumped as he pushes at and misses one that turns. The third umpire decides his little toe was just on the right side of the line, but that was close.</p> <p>\"As a diversion from England's scintillating batting thus far,\" writes Fraser Nock, \"could Bob Higgins' buddy in Slovenia point me in the direction of a bar that will be showing ManUre v Liverpool on Monday night, as I am flying into Ljubljana that afternoon?\" Oh go on then. </p> <p><strong>22nd over: England 79-3 (Trescothick 45, Flintoff 1)</strong> This is the stage where England should be assessing what sort of total they want. I think that 240 could be match-winning on this pitch, which makes batsmen work hard for their runs. And what's this? Flintoff is dropped at floating slip by Jayawardene off Vaas - that was a bad miss. And it could be a costly one.</p> <p>\"Why is Wayne Trotman your Turkey correspondent?\" harrumphs Robert Lewis. \"I live in Istanbul, and for credentials, I used to work with Bob Willis's wonderful dad, Ted, on a newspaper in Guildford.\" </p> <p><strong>21st over: England 78-3 (Trescothick 44, Flintoff 1)</strong> Sri Lanka are trying to wheedle as many quick overs as possible out of the occasional military medium of Jayawardene. Flintoff gets off the mark with a push to long-off for one that had more than a hint of leading edge about it. Just two off the over for a chastened England.</p> <p>\"I was going to make much the same point as Wayne Trotman before work intervened,\" claims Richard Marsden. \"Vaughan simply can't justify his place at number 3. Our openers are flaky enough as it is, and he offers neither any impetus to the early stages of the innings, nor any protection to the finishers, who shouldn't really be coming in before the 30th over. After all, there are only so many times Collingwood and Flintoff can rescue us from those all-too-common sticky patches...\"</p> <p><strong>20th over: England 76-3 (Trescothick 43, Flintoff 0)</strong> Back comes Vaas, who is dabbed to third man for four by Trescothick. A work for two to midwicket makes it six off the over. Oh, and Fred Flintoff is at the wicket.</p> <p>\"If Ed Airey needs any more convincing to take himself off to a wedding,\" writes David Smith, \"my Dad still tells me about the time, as a baby, I slept through his brother's wedding. This enabled him to keep slipping out \"to check up on me\" and watch Botham ripping the Aussies apart. So go Ed, it is your destiny...\"</p> <p> <strong>WICKET! Strauss run out 7 (70-3) </strong> More madness from England: after taking 12 off Jayawardene's first five balls, the batsmen push for a second to third man that was NEVER there! The third umpire confirms that Strauss's dive was in vain and England have lost their third wicket. Utterly needless.</p> <p> \"Thanks Steve,\" writes Phil Keegan in Graz. \"Actually we are playing our inaugural match at Velden this coming Sunday! Would any Guardian correspondents care to come over to cover it?\" Would love to, Phil. Will it be all-expenses paid?</p> <p><strong>18th over: England 57-2 (Trescothick 26, Strauss 6)</strong> Another let-off for England as Strauss mis-hooks Maharoof towards deep square leg. Sanath Jayasuriya's little legs go haring after it, but his dive is in vain as the ball pops out and Strauss picks up two lucky runs.</p> <p>\"I am aware that there is plenty of cricket played in Austria, through contact with a mate who is involved in similar ex-pat led cricket in Slovenia,\" writes Bob Higgins. \"Lots of clubs around Vienna I believe. My pal's team has a site at ljcricket.com, which may assist your correspondent.\"</p> <p><strong>17th over: England 55-2 (Trescothick 26, Strauss 4)</strong> Well, this is a surprise: on comes Mahela Jayawardene, whose seven one-day wickets have come at a cost of 72 apiece. He bowls little dobbers with the keeper standing up, and his first ball beats Strauss's defensive push. The third goes for a single to midwicket and the fourth and fifth defeat Trescothick, who has a little chuckle to himself. A surprise, perhaps. But for Sri Lanka, a pleasant one.</p> <p>\"I really am wondering for how much longer Vaughan can keep his place or at least still go in at No3,\" writes our Turkey corerspondent Wayne Trotman. \"A total of 55 games for an average of 25 is pretty poor; they were calling for Hussain to go and his was always around 30. Why not put Vaughan in at No7 and pick him for captaincy.\" </p> <p><strong>16th over: England 54-2 (Trescothick 26, Strauss 3)</strong> These are tricky moments for England. Another wicket now and Sri Lanka will definitely be on top. But - and I write this while touching the head of my colleague Rob Smyth - this pair can put England in a strong position by batting for the next 20 overs or so. Just two singles in that over from Maharoof.</p> <p>\"Having been coach to a team of Polish nationals that played in Austria in June,\" writes Steve Rackett, \"I can tell Phil Keegan their is a thriving league cricket league in Austria, perhaps ground sharing with an existing club might be a possibility. The ground at Velden in the Austrian alps has to be the most scenic in Europe.\" </p> <p><strong>15th over: England 52-2 (Trescothick 25, Strauss 2)</strong> Trescothick is the key man for England now, and I mean that with the greatest of respect for Andrew Flintoff. He's played himself in, and now he needs to go on. Meanwhile, there's four more as Tresco flashes Zoysa high over point, and the next ball yields a single to bring up England's fifty. Strauss needs some runs, and there are two of them through midwicket. A better over for England.</p> <p>\"Isn't Arnie from Graz?\" asks Richard Sankey. \"I'm sure he'd be honoured. He can never be president of the US so this has got to be the next best thing.\"</p> <p><strong>14th over: England 45-2 (Trescothick 20, Strauss 0)</strong> Sangakkara is convinced that Trescothick got the thinnest of edges as he nibbled outside off against Maharoof, but the bowler wasn't so sure and replays are inconclusive. Tresco escapes the danger end off the fourth ball of the over with a work to leg for one. But this is a struggle for England, and Andrew Strauss is beaten all ends up, as they say.</p> <p>\"If Ed Airey has so far missed all of Flintoff's big innings, could I respectfully ask him to go to a wedding, so the rest of us can enjoy another one?\" says Anton Lawrence. \"I don't think that England need this sort of jinxing...\"</p> <p><strong>13th over: England 44-2 (Trescothick 19, Strauss 0)</strong> I'm still in shock after that shot from Vaughan.</p> <p>\"Is this going to be one of those moments where you say 'England need a big innings from their captain' and Vaughan then gets himself out?\" asks Richard O'Hagan, moments before Vaughan gets himself out.</p> <p> <strong>WICKET! Vaughan b Zoysa 5 (44-2)</strong> An insane shot from Vaughan. Before Zoysa has even delivered the ball, Vaughan wanders across his stumps, exposing virtually all three to the bowler. All Zoysa has to do is aim at middle and leg. A farcical end to another disappointing one-day innings from the England captain.</p> <p><strong>12th over: England 41-1 (Trescothick 16, Vaughan 5)</strong> Vaughan is playing himself in very cautiously here. I wish he'd look for more quick singles early in his innings, because shouldering arms the whole time is precisely how the pressure mounts. Just one off Maharoof's over.</p> <p>Phil Keegan writes in with an unusual request. \"I am Chairman of the very recently (i.e. last Sunday in an Irish pub) formed Graz Cricket Club in Austria. We are a hodge podge of ex-pats from England, New Zealand, India and Sri Lanka and are currently looking for a ground and an honorary president. Any ideas on the latter? The local British Consul turned us down.\" It's a long shot, Phil. But stranger things have happened. </p> <p><strong>11th over: England 40-1 (Trescothick 16, Vaughan 5)</strong> Back comes Zoysa after his opening burst of 3-0-15-0 and he almost bags Vaughan, who picks up four runs with a textbook chinese cut. Can the ball get any closer to off stump without actually hitting it? Zoysa then beats Vaughan twice in two balls. These are not easy conditions for batting.</p> <p>\"It annoys me that they seem to rate one bowler over the other yet neither has played that many overs of first-class or Test cricket this summer,\" writes Paul Voller. \"We're comparing apples with oranges. Anderson is just out of practice.\" I agree with that last statement, Paul.</p> <p><strong>10th over: England 35-1 (Trescothick 15, Vaughan 1)</strong> Michael Vaughan caresses his second ball into the covers for a single. Will today be the day he convinces the world he can bat in pyjamas as well as in whites? Trescothick works the wicket-taker Maharoof past first slip for one more, but England need more of these singles.</p> <p>\"Having nursed more than the slightest hint of a hangover this morning,\" writes Ed Airey, \"I am PRAYING for a full day's play. I fully expect Flintoff to post a big score today, having missed all his big innings this summer by being at work or weddings/family do's.\"</p> <p><strong>9th over: England 33-1 (Trescothick 14, Vaughan 0)</strong> Sri Lanka needed that wicket because Solanki was really starting to motor. Unfortunately, that is often when he looks at his most vulnerable. In the meantime, Vaas drops short and Trescothick takes the chance to hammer him through the covers for four. </p> <p>\"Pretty boy Anderson should be out there with a ball in his hand,\" reckons Ed Collington. \"It would give him less time to groom his barnet, which can only be good news for all concerned.\"</p> <p><strong>WICKET! Solanki c Sangakkara b Maharoof 18 (29-1)</strong> An eventful over that began with Trescothick being badly dropped by Zoysa at mid-off ends with Solanki getting a thin inside edge through to the keeper. Sri Lanka's bowling change has worked a treat.</p> <p>\"Have you seen Billy's TV replay signal?\" asks Simon Sub. \"It's all wavy lines, not straight edges. I think he must kick his TV set quite a lot.\"</p> <p> <strong>7th over: England 24-0 (Trescothick 9, Solanki 14)</strong> Trescothick whips a rare loose delivery from Vaas to long leg for a single - he might have picked up four for that. Solanki then uses his feet superbly to flay Vaas just out of reach of a diving backward point and underneath the man at third man - four more! No rain yet. And no wickets.</p> <p><strong>6th over: England 19-0 (Trescothick 8, Solanki 10)</strong> A glorious straight-drive for four by Solanki off Zoysa, who is barely touching 80mph at the moment. England certainly aren't complaining.</p> <p>\"Would you have been tempted to pick James Anderson ahead of Wharf, given the conditions?\" asks Keith Dyer. \"Well, would you?\" I would in most conditions, Keith. I'm a bit worried that Wharf is going to get found out. Anderson is a far better bet for the 2007 World Cup. </p> <p><strong>5th over: England 15-0 (Trescothick 8, Solanki 6)</strong> It's a game of two ends at the moment, as it so often is against Sri Lanka's opening bowlers. That was another good over from Vaas, who concedes only a single off the last ball as Solanki dabs him elegantly to third man.</p> <p>\"Is it my imagination,\" writes Richard O'Hagan, \"or are Billy Bowden's signals becoming more and more extravagant? How long before we see him pirouetting like a ballerina to signal a 4, or doing a backflip whilst gesturing a 6? I only hope he never has to signal 'one short', as he'll probably poke his eye out.\" </p> <p><strong>4th over: England 14-0 (Trescothick 8, Solanki 5)</strong> Solanki opens England's boundary count with a searingly wristy flash past point off Zoysa. But the next delivery is an indication of the difficulties that England will face early on: it cuts back and almost takes Solanki's inside edge. Zoysa appeals for leg-before since the ball brushed the top of the pad, but that was too high and umpire Bowden spares us any more theatricals. Solanki then pinches a single to backward point, before Trescothick hammers Zoysa's final delivery - a half-volley - through the covers. Good over for England.</p> <p>\"I could've gone to this match today,\" writes Anton Lawrence, \"but if it's about to start raining then I am glad I didn't. Besides I did miss your sparkling commentary.\" Flattery will get you nowhere, Anton.</p> <p><strong>3rd over: England 5-0 (Trescothick 4, Solanki 0)</strong> Vaas beats Trescothick on the inside edge with a beauty that holds its line rather than swinging away, as Tresco was expecting. Vaas played a few games for Hampshire last season, so he probably knows this pitch better than any of the England players. A testing maiden.</p> <p><strong>2nd over: England 5-0 (Trescothick 4, Solanki 0)</strong> Nuwan Zoysa makes up Sri Lanka's all-left-arm new-ball attack, but his second delivery slips down leg and is signalled wide by Billy Bowden. At least I think that's what that strange gesture means - he bends his right knee slightly, as if curtseying, then rather camply extends both arms. Anyway, it's one to the total. Trescothick steals the sneakiest of singles into the off-side and England have made a steady start.</p> <p><strong>1st over: England 3-0 (Trescothick 3, Solanki 0)</strong> Marcus Trescothick gets the scoreboard moving by running Chaminda Vaas's third delivery to third man for a couple. He then squeezes a single past backward point two balls later. That was a probing over by Vaas - and there was more than a hint of away-swing from the left-hander.</p> <p><strong>10.13am</strong> \"A little premature putting a smiling Freddie on the page,\" suggests Paul Voller. \"Could be nasty - he didn't post a big score against Zimbabwe.\"</p> <p><strong>10.10am</strong> My word, those clouds are grey. John Kettley tells me there's a 70% chance of showers, whatever that means. If it's a complete washout over the two days set aside for the match, England will go through because they have a better net run-rate.</p> <p>The two teams:</p> <p><strong>England</strong> 1 Marcus Trescothick, 2 Vikram Solanki, 3 Michael Vaughan (c), 4 Andrew Strauss, 5 Andrew Flintoff, 6 Paul Collingwood, 7 Geraint Jones (wkt), 8 Ashley Giles, 9 Alex Wharf, 10 Darren Gough, 11 Steve Harmison.</p> <p><strong>Sri Lanka</strong>: 1 Avishka Gunawardene, 2 Sanath Jayasuriya, 3 Marvan Atapattu (c), 4 Saman Jayantha, 5 Kumar Sangakkara (wkt), 6 Mahela Jayawardene, 7 Tillekeratne Dilshan, 8 Upul Chandana, 9 Chaminda Vaas, 10 Farveez Maharoof, 11 Nuwan Zoysa.</p> <p> <strong>10.05am</strong> England are unchanged from the side that beat Zimbabwe, but Sri Lanka, remember, are without their off-spinning wizard Muttiah Muralitharan. England should be very wary of Chaminda Vaas, however - if he gets the ball to swing, we could see a few early shouts for leg-before.</p> <p>Sri Lanka have won 16 of their last 17 one-day matches, but their record in England is poor: eight wins in 27 game, and only two out of nine against England themselves. My metaphorical money's on England - but only just.</p> <p><strong>10am</strong> Good morning and a hearty welcome to live over-by-over coverage of England's do-or-die Champions Trophy game against Sri Lanka at the Rose Bowl in Southampton. In case you've been away on Mars or somewhere, the winners of this game will play Australia at Edgbaston on Tuesday in the semi-finals, a game that has been billed in the media as an appetite-whetter for next summer's Ashes.</p> <p>The only problem is that Sri Lanka would quite like to win this game too, and they have made a good start by winning the toss and generously inviting England to bat, which makes sense given the grey clouds lurking over the ground and the showery forecast. </p> <p>It should be a cracker.</p>",
  "<p>Why would a parent decide to opt their children out of a normal school environment and take on teaching them at home? It's expensive and often a parent must give up a career to take on a responsibility usually left to the professionals. But, according to the scant information available, home education is on the rise. </p> <p>It's hard to establish the exact number of families opting to home educate in the UK; the existing research puts the number anywhere between 25,000 and 150,000. The widest research into the subject in the UK, a report to the then Department for Education and Employment in 1999, concluded that it is almost impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy how many children were educated at home. </p> <p>However, Education Otherwise, a grassroots parents' group, says it is getting 100 approaches a month from parents who are thinking about, or have started, home education. The organisation's membership has doubled in the last two years to 6,000 families. </p> <p>The reason why it's so difficult to tell how many children are at being educated at home is that nobody asks parents. Parents have a legal responsibility to ensure their children are educated at school or \"otherwise\" to meet their age, ability, aptitude and any special educational needs requirements. If a child is already in a state school, parents have to tell the school in writing that they are taking their child out of the system - and the school must then tell the local authority. But if a child has never been to school, or was in a private school, they don't exist to the authorities and the parents are not obliged to \"declare\" them.</p> <p>Local authorities can inspect the teaching provision, but can't force the parent to \"present\" the child. Ultimately, however, if they feel the child's educational needs aren't being met, they can take the parents to court.</p> <p>Last month, teachers called for the laws to be tightened. Why, asked the Professional Association of Teachers at its annual conference, should some of these children's standards of education and safety go unmonitored? </p> <p>Why, responded the home educating organisations, should teachers care? Surely it's a parent's right to choose what is best for their children? </p> <p>It's a familiar tale of state versus individual, where the culture of accountability in government and local authorities crashes head-on with the parents' belief that they alone are responsible for their child's welfare and education. </p> <p>Traditionally, people who choose to home educate have been seen as libertarians making a political decision to free their children from the straitjacket of a classroom. </p> <p>But the most comprehensive research on families of home educators, published in 1999 by Alan Thomas, a home education expert from the Institute of Education, showed that this stereotype was changing. </p> <p>\"People who opt to educate their children at home from the outset do not come anywhere near fitting the stereotype of the home educator: new age traveller, hothouser, religious fundamentalist or crank,\" Dr Thomas writes. \"What motivates these parents to educate their children at home, especially their concerns with the limitations of school, would strike a chord with most parents.\"</p> <p>He says that apart from the traditional \"conviction\" of home educators, more are seeing this option as their only choice. Parents may have failed to find the right school for their child, feel their child is not being stretched enough or is not getting enough help. Severe cases of bullying are also a factor. </p> <p>It's a view seen elsewhere. A national census of home educators in the US, which found a 29% boost in home educating in the last five years, reported this month that bullying and worries about standards at school were the main factors. Religion, however, is more of an issue for Americans, with 30% of home educators opting for it to provide better \"religious and moral instruction\". Only 11% of British parents in Dr Thomas' study cited religion as a factor. Fundamental to the debate in Britain is a clash of cultures about how children should be taught. Phil Hicks, a London-based representative of Education Otherwise, who has educated his three children at home, says that the authorities are not always sympathetic to different ways of learning. \"There are home educators who do it similarly to the way teachers do it in schools. There are others who do it through child-centred learning. The problem is that LEAs like the first form, but are uncomfortable with the second form. For the informal forms of home educations, they can be antagonistic because they don't understand it.\"</p> <p>The research, where it exists, is complimentary about that informal style of learning. In a 2002 report based on interviews with more than 100 families, Paula Rothermel, from the University of Durham, found that 64% of home-educated four and five-year-olds scored more than 75% in Pips baseline assessment tests, a measure of ability among primary aged children, as opposed to 5.1% of children nationally. </p> <p>The fear among home educating groups is that a more heavy-handed approach from local authorities brings with it preconceptions of what an education should be, a \"norm\", which is exactly what some parents are opting out of. </p> <p>But there's also an issue of the safety of the child. If children have absolutely no contact with the authorities, how is it possible to make sure they are safe? There is no suggestion anywhere in the research that children who are educated at home are being abused, but a system that allows some children to have no contact with schools, social services or health officials clearly leaves local authorities, with their legal responsibility to safeguard children, exposed. </p> <p>Eileen Munro, a child protection expert from the London School of Economics, says that any vulnerable children should already show up on the social services system. Alerting the authorities' suspicions to home-educated children could just create more work for an already stretched system when there's no indication that they are in danger. \"We have some real problems in the world. Why create one where one doesn't exist? Drawing attention to lots of minor problems is just clogging up the system, it will not make children safer.\"</p> <p>It's both a practical and a philosophical debate that runs to the core of the relationship between families and the government. Whose ultimate responsibility is it to educate children? And who's to say what form that education should take? </p> <p>The law clearly states that responsibility lies with the parents, and there's an element of the education establishment that is uncomfortable with that concept. But if parents are blaming the provision on offer by the state for why they chose to opt out, shouldn't the government take some responsibility too? One solution might be for all local authorities working with home educators to be trained in all kinds of teaching, or for the government to be true to its current mantra of offering \"choice\" for parents. \"You don't find many radical alternatives to traditional schools in the state system,\" says Dr Thomas. \"There's no choice really.\"</p>",

He accused parliamentary authorities of failing to improve security despite this intelligence.</p> <p>Mr Hain said: \"The security service briefed me some time ago about some intelligence that they had about al-Qaida operatives in Britain focusing on parliament.\" He would not go into the detail of the briefing but said the security services had told him they had been trying \"for some months\" to persuade the authorities to be much more vigilant. </p> <p>He added: \"When I was briefed and I probed and I spoke to the director general about that intelligence I was very determined to act upon it. I was horrified about the potential threat\" The incident underlined the need for better security, Mr Hain said.</p> <p>Mr Hain added that the latest breach of security by the Sun reporter had \"done us a favour\" by exposing serious lapses. The reporter used bogus references to get a job as a waiter, then - filmed by the paper for its exclusive today - smuggled fake bomb-making equipment into the building. </p> <p>A turf war over parliamentary security appears to be developing between the government - led by Mr Hain and the home secretary, David Blunkett - and the Commons, led by Speaker Michael Martin, who controls the current security set up led by the Serjeant at Arms.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Blunkett said: \"I'm in charge of security for the nation as a whole and what's happened here undermines confidence in the security service and counter-terrorism branch who, like me, have absolutely no control over the decisions of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\" </p> <p>He endorsed Mr Hain's call for a security director, saying Britain needed \"not medievalism but modernity\" </p> <p>The office of Serjeant at Arms - currently held by Sir Michael Cummins - has responsibility for security in the Commons. The Serjeant and his staff of ushers and doorkeepers - known as the \"men in tights\" because of their traditional dress - are responsible for maintaining order in the Commons chamber, galleries, committee rooms and precincts, and the control of access to them. They have been criticised as farcically inadequate in the era of suicide bombers. </p> <p>One of the pro-hunt protesters arrested after storming the House of Commons chamber said security was \"risible\" and declared: \"I would do it again tomorrow.\" </p> <p>David Redvers, 34, claimed the stunt was \"frighteningly simple\" to pull off, denying the suggestion by the Metropolitan Police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, yesterday that the attack was an \"inside job.\" He told the Today programme: \"The first I heard of it was the morning before. It was literally put together very, very quickly by eight people. </p> <p>\"I am quite certain none of us have ever been in trouble with the law. I don't want to see the inside of a police cell again. We just wanted to make a point and make it as strong as we could, but it was put together literally on the back of an envelope 24 hours before.\" </p> <p>Among the eight men arrested were Otis Ferry, the 21-year-old son of rock star Bryan, and England polo player Luke Tomlinson, 27, a close friend of Princes William and Harry. </p> <p>The others held were Mr Redvers; John Holliday, 37, a huntsman from Ledbury, Herefordshire; Robert Thame, 34, who plays polo with Princes Charles, William and Harry; auctioneer Andrew Elliot, 42, from Bromesberrow, near Ledbury; point-to-point jockey Richard Wakeham, 34, from York; and chef Nick Wood, 41. </p> <p>Meanwhile, one of the 17 people arrested during the pro-hunting demonstration in London on Wednesday has been charged, police confirmed today. Brett Parsons, 31, a labourer from Stickle Ball Hill Farm, near Glastonbury, Somerset, is charged with using threatening behaviour and obstructing the highway and will appear before Tower Bridge Magistrates' Court on September 29. </p> <p>The 15 men and one woman also held on Wednesday have either been released on bail, released without charge or issued with an on-the-spot fixed penalty notice. Twenty-seven people were injured during the demonstration. </p>",
  "Kofi Annan's declaration that the US and British attack on Iraq was illegal will renew the pressure on Tony Blair over the war. The prime minister's claim that he went to war partly to defend the United Nations' authority in the face of Saddam Hussein's non-compliance with security council resolutions now lies in tatters - along with his other justifications. <p>When the UN secretary-general himself says that it was Washington and London who were not complying with international law, Bush and Blair should now clearly acknowledge they did wrong. </p> <p>But it is not just the launch of the war which was illegal. Illegality continues today. Take the US helicopter attack on a crowd in Haifa Street, Baghdad, last Sunday, which killed 13 people and injured dozens (including a Guardian reporter). It was almost certainly a war crime. </p> <p>The pilots' unarmed victims came into the street after insurgents had destroyed an American Bradley fighting vehicle, a cross between a tank and an armoured personnel carrier. The soldiers inside it were quickly rescued by comrades and withdrew. By the time the jubilant crowd gathered to gawp at the Bradley's smouldering remains, military activity had ceased. </p> <p>Why then did the pilots shoot? The official version is that ground fire was being aimed at them. Even if true, questions remain. Why didn't the helicopters fly off to safety? Fire need not be answered, if there is a more sensible way of avoiding being hit, especially when the ground troops the helicopters were supposedly protecting had already left the scene. Secondly, did the pilots properly assess the risk to civilians from a disproportionate response? From the casualties caused, the evidence strongly suggests they did not. </p> <p>The assumption has to be that the pilots' motive was revenge. If so, the incident would not be unique. In case after case, the behaviour of US forces in Iraq appears to be degenerating into vindictive killing, decided not only at the tactical but also at command level. </p> <p>Lieutenant-general James Conway, who commanded US marines at Falluja in April, recently revealed he was unhappy with a higher-ranking decision to assault the town after four American contractors were killed and their bodies mutilated. He was against \"attacking out of revenge\", he now says. </p> <p>His description of the offensive's primary purpose is surely right, although - as with the Haifa Street massacre - no war crimes trial is likely. Belatedly, and usually only after media exposure, abuses in US- and UK-run military prisons in Iraq have led to court proceedings. The bigger issue of crimes against civilians perpetrated in the air above Iraqi cities and from tanks and other vehicles is still taboo. </p> <p>Armies which resort to revenge are usually ones that are losing. Within the Sunni region, Ramadi, Falluja and Samarra have become no-go areas. The same is true of the Shia holy cities of Kerbala and Najaf. It is not that US forces are impotent. With their overwhelming fire-power they are unbeatable. What is changing is the growth of resistance, both military and political, and the ebbing-away of US legitimacy. Increasing numbers of influential Iraqis tell US commanders to keep out of populated areas and withdraw to barracks, as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani did most notably in Najaf. </p> <p>The US army's excessive use of force is a key factor. But there is also a growing sense among Iraqis that the occupation is causing more problems than it is solving. Polls have shown for several months that the number of Iraqis who say they would feel safer if foreign troops left immediately exceeds the number who would feel less safe. They want Iraqi security forces to take over. </p> <p>After comprehensive analysis of the main polls, plus its own interviews with individuals and focus groups, the centre-right Washington thinktank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies recently concluded: \"Iraqis have little confidence in US and other international forces _ Iraqis generally dislike the continued presence of US-led forces in their country; many consider the occupation to be on-going despite the June 28 handover of sovereignty.\" </p> <p>The CSIS also found it is too late for the US to turn things round with quick improvements to the botched reconstruction process or by funding a massive job-creation programme. \"The occupation will not be judged by the sum of its consequences, but rather as occupation. Put simply, Iraqi pride in national sovereignty is more deeply rooted than the US anticipated,\" its study says. </p> <p>Popular feelings are percolating upwards and influencing the forthcoming Iraqi election campaign. The CSIS reports that \"it is highly likely that the single unifying theme espoused by Iraq's politicians will be to invite the US to leave Iraq once there is an elected Iraqi government in place\". </p> <p>This being so, those in the US who see Iraq as a strategic asset and covet long-term bases will probably try to postpone the January elections. Noises are already being made that insecurity will prevent them being free. Ayad Allawi, the US-appointed prime minister, and other former exiles who returned to Iraq with no political base, have an incentive to delay the poll so as to perpetuate their power. </p> <p>Some analysts are making gloomy predictions that Iraq will split apart if US troops pull out. Supporters of the fragmentation scenario include long-time backers of Kurdish independence, and their views are coloured by that. Others claim to see a risk of violent clashes between Sunnis and Shias and even civil war. </p> <p>These forecasts are probably too pessimistic, but in the short term the greater danger is that the US will use the pretext of protecting the elections to try to \"recapture\" cities it has lost. This would be a disastrous mistake. </p> <p>The UN election plan treats Iraq as a single constituency and makes it unnecessary for candidates or parties to campaign everywhere. Even if there were no violence, Shia parties - such as Da'wa, Sciri, and Moqtada al-Sadr's people (if they decide to run) - would not campaign in Sunni cities. In reverse, the same goes for the largely Sunni Iraqi Islamic party. </p> <p>So the fact that Falluja, Ramadi and other Sunni towns are virtually out of bounds to outsiders is not an argument for cancelling the elections there. Cancellation would send a terrible signal, implying that Allawi and his US backers were trying to disenfranchise the Sunni and favour Shias. This would be more likely to provoke sectarian conflict than any other measure. </p> <p>Iraqis of almost all persuasions want elections, and the claim that the resistance is trying to block them has no evidence to back it. Most Iraqis, including the militias, see the elections as the best key to ending the occupation and getting the US to leave. Their views should be respected. </p> <p>&lt; A HREF=\"j.steele@theguardian.com\"&gt;j.steele@theguardian.com&lt; / A &gt;</p>",

  "The corrosive impact of the Iraq crisis in almost all areas of international relations, as well as on Iraq's long-suffering civilians, was dramatically demonstrated yesterday by the UN general secretary Kofi Annan's blunt declaration that last year's war was illegal. <p>The recent spat between the US and Iraq's northern neighbour Turkey is a case in point. Since the war officially ended, Turkey has fretted about Iraq's possible fragmentation, Kurdish separatism, and the safety of Iraq's ethnic Turk minority.</p> <p>When US forces attacked the city of Tal Afar, home to many Turkomen, last week, Ankara finally drew the line.</p> <p>Unless they called a \"total stop\" to the fighting there, the foreign minister Abdullah Gul said, Turkey would suspend all cooperation, closing the vital supply lines to northern Iraq.</p> <p>Thus has a \"liberated\" Iraq achieved by default something that Saddam Hussein never could: an open if temporary rupture between the US and a key Muslim ally which is now increasingly identifying with the EU.</p> <p>Turkey's concern about regional stability is shared by Iraq's other neighbours. Jordan and Syria have good cause for alarm, and according to a new study by the Chatham House thinktank in London, full-scale civil war in Iraq would draw in Saudi Arabia in support of the Sunni minority.</p> <p>The war has had a deeply destabilising impact on the House of Saud. It has further strained ties with the US al ready badly frayed by 9/11. Whereas in the past, Saudi jihadis, principally from al-Qaida, have gone abroad to pursue their terrorist aims, the US occupation of Iraq has drawn them to a new base, awash with arms, from which to attack western interests in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>On Wednesday another Briton fell victim to a barely contained internal breakdown, fatally shot in Riyadh.</p> <p>\"In all likelihood, Saudi Arabia will be contaminated with jihadis in the same way as Afghanistan,\" the study says. \"Osama bin Laden's ideological children are returning to his homeland.\"</p> <p>One thing at stake is the west's oil supply. If the Iraq war really was about securing the Middle East oilfields , then George Bush may be well on the way to achieving the exact opposite.</p> <p>Another ostensibly unsettling consequence is that Iran may emerge stronger, in regional terms; another potential case of the US shooting itself in the foot.</p> <p>Iranian economic, cultural and political influence with Iraq's Shia majority is growing. An isolated Syria is ever more dependent on Iranian goodwill. And the US is so bogged down militarily that, it is argued, the chances of aggression against Tehran are now diminishing.</p> <p>For these reasons Iran's dominant conservatives hope the US will agree to unconditional dialogue. However, civil war in Iraq could just as easily suck them in against the US on the side of the Shia.</p> <p>In this unpredictable, regional evolution can be heard the death knell for Mr Bush's \"Greater Middle East Initiative\" to deliver democracy to all the Arabs.</p> <p>And his infamous doctrine of pre-emptive strikes, preventive war and forcible regime change also seems to be dying in the aftermath of its first application in Iraq.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of cormorants are to be shot because anglers complained that they were eating the fish they wanted to catch. This has enraged the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which says the species is protected and it will take court action to save them.</p> <p>Ben Bradshaw, the minister for nature conservation, did not consult the RSPB before announcing yesterday that 3,000 birds a year could be <br> slaughtered. Over six years this would wipe out the British cormorant population, even though the species is protected by the EU birds directive.</p> <p>EU rules permit the culling of up to 300 birds a year if all other methods to scare them away or protect the fish have failed. Now there will be a presumption that the presence of cormorants is leading to fish losses.</p> <p>There are an estimated 17,000 resident cormorants and 6,000 winter visitors; a big increase from the 1980s, when cormorants were a relative rarity inland, being mostly confined to coasts and estuaries.</p> <p>Heavily stocked trout lakes have provided easy pickings, and the improved quality of rivers and lakes has let cormorants breed.</p> <p>Mr Bradshaw said his ruling <br> was not intended to wipe out the cormorant but to reduce the number. \"We have accepted for some time that cormorants can and do cause damage to certain habitats,\" he said.</p> <p>Mark Avery, director of conservation at the RSPB, said: \"The minister has never consulted us about this. There is no scientific justification for this, and we believe it is against the law.</p> <p>\"This is the thin edge of a very thick wedge. Next anglers will be complaining that otters and ospreys are eating fish. Gamekeepers will say merlins are wiping out grouse and farmers complain geese are damaging their crops.</p> <p>\"Is all wildlife vulnerable to some special interest group pleading with the minister that their financial interests are being damaged?</p> <p>\"There is no scientific or legal justification for killing on this scale. We are consulting our lawyers and have already sent a warning letter to ministers saying we believe they are in breach of EU law. We will take any action we can to get this decision overturned.\"</p> <p>The Moran committee, which represents anglers, was delighted with the decision. Terry Mansbridge, chairman of its bird group, said: \"This will significantly improve the ability of fishery managers to protect their fish stocks whilst not affecting the conservation status of the birds.\"</p> <p>The killing season for cormorants will be August 31 to April 15, but this may be extended to May 1 in fish spawning sites.</p> <p>The British Association for Shooting and Conservation <br> also welcomed the decision. Its director of conservation, Tim Russell, said: \"Many people who shoot are also keen anglers and have seen at first hand the devastation which a colony of cormorants can caused to inland fisheries and waterways.\"</p> <p>On another issue the RSPB released a report yesterday on industrial fishing for sand eels in the north-east Atlantic. They are turned into animal feed and pellets for farmed fish.</p> <p>Many sea bird species which rely on young fish and sand eels to feed their young are in steep decline in that area. The RSPB has been campaigning for curbs on industrial fishing which it believes will lead to further crashes in fish stocks.</p> <p><strong> Leader comment, page 29<br>theguardian.com/fish</strong></p>",
  "<p>Winsome self-deprecation and ladylike modesty aside, I am not natural front-row material. My clothes have never knowingly brushed against an iron, the concept of high heels induces a depression in me comparable only to the one caused by Bryan McFadden's current number-one status in the charts (\"And we'll invite the family round / And drink some English tea\" - rock on, Bry!) and my hair is as temperamental as my four-year-old neighbour, running the emotional gamut from badly behaved to hyperactive. </p> <p>Although this is usually a bearable state of affairs - my natural charm generally gets me through, obviously - during fashion weeks, appearances matter. Contrary to popular opinion, it is not the bone-jutting models who are the oddest sights at the shows, but the specimens in the front row. But is one born with a front-row manner or can one learn it? Some front-row traits are well known (sunglasses, bizarre headwear) but it is the lesser details that mark out the amature. But, as Mulder and Scully told us all along, just knowing that the truth is out there does not guarantee you acceptance among the aliens. </p> <p> <strong> 1 Have a look</strong> </p> <p> This goes far beyond just wearing the latest designer trends. You need to create an image that the lesser folk associate with you, elevating you to the pedestal of an icon. You could - oh, just to take an example - always wear sunglasses (achoo, Anna Wintour!). Seeing as I am limited by my wardrobe, my chosen image is \"high-street girl\" and things get off to a cracking start. \"Are you actually wearing a Hennes hoodie to Calvin Klein?\" asks one of my fashion colleagues, while perusing my first outfit. I feel certain my image will soon be the talk of the town. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Be on time</strong> </p> <p>Yes, fashion shows are notoriously late, but this is not due to the lofty front-row folk turning up at the last minute because they have been too busy lunching with Elton. They perch on their seats politely and benignly on time. It is because of the scraggle muffins like me who delay proceedings by getting lost en route. In the fashion world it is now more cool to be on time, primarily because it suggests you have a car and driver and, partly because it hints that you are a woman in control - not, for example, a woman who got lost on the New York subway system again and then cried for half an hour about missing the Marc Jacobs show while the crowds threw money at her thinking they were witnessing a piece of performance art. Just as an example. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Display absolutely no emotion whatsoever</strong> </p> <p>Nope, not even despairing boredom, as you might be tempted to express while waiting for a show that is two hours late and haven't eaten since Tuesday. So no behaviour that suggests you are killing time, such as, say, reading Closer magazine or ripping off your cuticles. At first, I think I am carrying this off with aplomb. Looking at the photos, however, my facial expression suggests, not so much \"glacial imperviousness\" as \"pain verging on constipation\". </p> <p> <strong> 4 Talk to no one while you wait</strong> </p> <p>The only talking that is permitted is to a celebrity neighbour, or on your mobile, or - even better - to a celebrity on your mobile. There can be absolutely no talking to the people behind you. Remember, everyone in the rows behind you is a lowly, parasitic peasant. </p> <p>Hurrah! A front-row rule I actually can do. Whether this owes more to my elegantly quiet manner or to the fact that no one will actually talk to me is, perhaps, a moot point. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Master the leg cross</strong> </p> <p>Very important: cross your legs, swivel them to the side and then lie them flat on top of one another. This is excellent for displaying one's sveltness and the length of one's limbs. I try once and fall off my seat. I try again and my foot cramps. I excuse myself from this one because I am physically incapable. </p> <p> <strong> 6 No head-swivelling</strong> </p> <p>While the rest of the audience waggle their heads, Wimbledon-style, watching the models, yours is pointed dead at the curtain from which the models emerge, and never budges. This is because by the time the model walks down the runway, the whole look is pass\u00e9 and not worthy of your attention. Again, I fail on this one, through, I stress, no fault of my own. Elizabeth Hurley was sitting three down from me, so besotted gawking was, surely, justified. </p> <p> <strong> 7 No note-taking</strong> </p> <p>Such harried scribbling is left to the lowly packhorses who work for you; you are far too important to bother. Lord, you don't want to give them the impression you are actually working. </p> <p>So I leave behind my doodled-up notebook for the day and feel sooo front row. OK, two hours later I can't remember anything I've seen, which makes my news report somewhat, shall we say, more improvised than factual - but, hey, at least I looked good. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Change your outfit between each show</strong> </p> <p>An ideal tactic for you to display how many fashionable garments you own. But it does rely on your closet being packed to the gills with said fashionable garments in the first place - not numerous (and frequently tea-stained) pink hooded tops from H&amp;M. Ideally, opt for clothes that display admirable disregard for practicality. To whit, designer Michael Kors was asked this week for his \"rules for living\". His response? \"Never wear socks and wear summer clothes in the winter.\" Right on, Mike! I think we should take a moment to consider the wisdom of this advice. And perhaps another moment. Yes. Hum. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Have a posse</strong> </p> <p>This could be either a flock of minions who flitter around you at the end of each show, or a pair of burly bouncers who aid your entrances and exits (see 10), or both. I try asking a handful of fashion hacks if they would like to be my posse but, judging from the haste of their departures, I think they may have thought I said something else. I could, of course, ask the one person with whom I actually do go to the shows. Unfortunately, that would be my boss, and I somehow don't think that asking your boss to be your fashion 'ho would be a move recommended by any career guidance counsellor. </p> <p> <strong> 10 Flee from the show at the end and don't spare the horses</strong> </p> <p>You don't want to get stuck among the packhorses. When asked this week why she requires three ex-naval seals to wait on her at the shows, Anna Wintour replied that they were there to ward off the autograph hunters who \"constantly pester\" her. </p> <p>Unable to rustle up any naval seals at short notice, I rely on my wits. Years of training by battling through sales on the high street have sharpened my elbows to veritable points and my right foot is a demon at tripping up inconvenient people who block my path. Oddly, I remain unpestered, suggesting that I haven't really passed the test. I knew I should have washed my hoodie.</p>",

  "MPs mounting an attempt to impeach Tony Blair for allegedly misleading the country over the war with Iraq yesterday expressed confidence they could secure enough support to force a Commons debate early next year. <p>The organisers, who launched the campaign last month, have the backing of 21 MPs, including the former Labour defence minister Peter Kilfoyle, the former Conservative Foreign Office minister Douglas Hogg QC, and the Lib Dem MP Jenny Tonge. By January they hope to secure 50 supporters to revive this antiquated parliamentary device.</p> <p>The campaign has received added impetus by the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, who declared the US-led invasion of Iraq illegal earlier this week.</p> <p>Alex Salmond, the Scottish National Party leader and one of the organisers, said: \"It is important democratically, when all other procedures fail, that parliament call the prime minister to account.\"</p> <p>The campaign organisers will publish independent legal advice from barristers Rabinder Singh and Conor Gearty on Wednesday. \"It will be a robust argument in favour of impeachment,\" a member of the campaign said yesterday.</p> <p>But a government source involved in the issue was dismissive of the move, casting doubt on whether the MPs would even be allowed to hold a debate. \"They have not got a prayer,\" he said.</p> <p>The government points to a Commons committee that examined parliamentary pro cedure in 1999 and concluded that the use of impeachment was now so remote as to be considered obsolete. It has been going through the parliamentary rulebook and examined various routes the MPs could pursue. According to the source, all of them would be blocked off at an early stage.</p> <p>But the campaign organisers claim that if 50 MPs - or even 30 - ask for a debate, it will be difficult for the speaker, Michael Martin, to refuse. </p> <p>To impeach Mr Blair they would need to secure a Commons majority in order to send the issue to the House of Lords. </p> <p>No one realistically expects to impeach the prime minister, but the rebels will be satisfied with securing a debate to air an issue which, they say, Mr Blair no longer wants to discuss. They are working towards a January debate. </p> <p>The impeachment case is being built on a 100-page document, A case to answer, produced for the MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Adam Price, by two academics, Glen Rangwala and Dan Plesch. They claim that Mr Blair repeatedly misled the Commons in the run-up to war. </p> <p>Nine Scottish National party and Welsh nationalist MPs are at the core of the campaign. So far, they have only managed to gain the backing of some Tories, including Mr Hogg, a couple of Liberals and one Labour MP. They have failed to win over the Labour MPs who voted against war. </p> <p>Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for Linlithgow and a leading opponent of the war, said that though he was distressed by Mr Blair's decision to go to war, he could not bring himself to support impeachment. </p> <p>He described the move as \"wheeze\", but he said he was not dismissive of Mr Price and Mr Salmond for trying. </p> <p>Edward Garnier, a Conservative MP and former shadow attorney general, is among the handful of Tory MPs backing impeachment. He said the process was \"factually and legally compelling\". </p> <p>Vernon Bogdanor, a professor of government at Oxford University, said impeachment had been superseded. Under the modern party system ministers were responsible to parliament. </p> <p>He said government party MPs were more likely to re main loyal in the event of an impeachment proceedings. </p> <p>The former lord advocate of Scotland Lord Murray, who faced an impeachment threat in the 70s, said he thought a debate on the impeachment of the prime minister could not be avoided. </p> <p>\"My view happens to be that the decision to go to war was illegal under international law, and that the reason given for going to war in the first place was insufficient to make it legal,\" he said.</p> <p><b>An obsolete power?</b></p> <p>Parliament's power of impeachment is so antique that the late 18th century trial of Warren Hastings counts as one of the more modern cases. </p> <p>Once applied to medieval barons, impeachment of commoners for abusing high office began after the civil war and died out two centuries later. The failed attempt to impeach Palmerston in 1848 for signing a treaty with Russia was the last. </p> <p>The most famous such case involves Hastings. His ordeal dragged on for 13 years before he was finally cleared by the Lords. He was accused of exploiting his post as India's governor, and his trial was a political sensation.<br><b> Julian Glover</b></p>",
  "To start with, Lieutenant-Colonel Alan King, employed by the US defence department, did not think he had much chance of succeeding in his mission. His only qualification for being dispatched into the labyrinthine world of Iraqi tribes in August 2003 was a master's degree in international relations from a top American university. But his superiors were insistent: for months the US army had been floundering in the Iraqi cities that it had conquered with such ease; for months its troops had been fired at from every rooftop, spotted in every village and betrayed at every level of a tribal hierarchy they could not understand. <p>As for finding local allies and influential people prepared to go along with the occupation, the few thousand exiles and Arab auxiliaries who had taken part with the Americans in their \"glorious Iraq campaign\" had turned out to be useless. US officers soon discovered that their Iraqi advisers, guides and interpreters were liars, cheats or people who had been cut off from their local roots for so long that the value of their advice and intelligence was virtually nil. Throughout the country hundreds of men looking suitably oriental in their keffiyehs had introduced themselves to the new masters of Iraq. \"I'm Sheikh Ali,\" they might say, \"and I fought against Saddam Hussein all my life. Appoint me mayor, or governor, or minister. Give me money, weapons for my tribe, and I'll quickly put a pacified town in your hands.\" </p> <p>Mistakes were made. For example, to protect an official appointed by their superiors without any consultation, US troops were forced to fire on demonstrators who knew that the individual who had been foisted on them was a notorious crook. In many cases it took the US army and its civilian proconsul, Paul Bremer, months to come to the same conclusion and take appropriate action, which often involved jailing the man concerned. </p> <p>In this explosive context King suddenly found himself ordered to take matters in hand. His initial remit was ill-defined: he had to find credible interlocutors for the occupying authorities and set up \"an organic link\" between the army and the Iraqi tribes - no easy task. \"To start with I was completely at sea,\" King admits. \"We didn't understand anything about the tribal factor. We trusted all sorts of bogus sheikhs who were real crooks.\" Particularly well remembered is Sheikh al-Assi al-Obeidi - a genuine sheikh - with a cohort of several thousand men, sheep and women in his villages between Tikrit and Kirkuk. Paid by the US to protect the oil pipelines running across his territory from guerrilla attacks, the sheikh himself concocted some acts of sabotage so he could extract more dollars and weapons for his men. He was eventually unmasked. </p> <p>King plugged away at his investigations. He discovered that the greatest American university experts, such as Yitzhak Nakash and Amitzia Baram, had advised Bush from the start not to neglect the tribal factor in Iraq. The Iraqi tribes rebelled against their British colonisers in the 1920s. They were quelled at the cost of much bloodshed. Subsequently the 1958 revolution robbed their leaders, the sheikhs, of the vast tracts of land they had controlled on behalf of the clans, subclans, tribes and subtribes. </p> <p>Initially, at least, the secular and progressive Ba'athists did everything in their power to abolish a system they regarded as archaic and even feudal. In the 70s and 80s, breaking with centuries of tradition, they prohibited Iraqis from attaching their tribal affiliations to their surname. Saddam personally set an example by removing the \"al-Tikriti\" after his name, which indicated his geographical and tribal origin. He stuck it back on again just before invading Kuwait in 1990 and harped on it even more when his crippled regime decided to revive tribal traditions and powers in order better to protect Iraq's borders from enemy infiltration and keep law and order in rural areas. Tribes and their customs then suddenly came back into vogue. </p> <p>When the Americans opened the Iraqi archives last year, they discovered that by the time the regime was toppled it had recognised no fewer than 7,380 tribal sheikhs. Just before the US invasion, a constant stream of them were shown on television swearing allegiance to Saddam. Eminent figures in all the leading Iraqi tribes, particularly the Shammar, the tribe to which the interim president, Ghazi Yawer, belongs, collaborated with the regime. </p> <p>\"Between August and December 2003, I think I must have met something like 3,300 sheikhs,\" King says. \"I've since learnt that there are barely more than 100 genuine sheikhs of major tribes in Iraq. The rest are self-appointed guys puffed up with their own importance.\" </p> <p>\"What King did not realise,\" says Ghazi Hussein al-Shammari, a Baghdad expert who later became his adviser, \"is that Saddam had such a soft spot for sheikhs that he created thousands of them.\" The Iraqis called them sheikhs \"made in Taiwan\" or \"the sheikhs of the 90s\". \"That policy of greatly increasing the number of sheikhs considerably weakened the tribal system,\" says Shammari. </p> <p>So what proportion of Iraq's 25 million inhabitants still feel attached to their tribal roots? \"At least 90%,\" says Yawer, who is related to the supreme chief of his Shammar tribe, which numbers 600,000 people. </p> <p>Dr Saad Naji Jawad al-Saati, professor of political science at Baghdad University, strongly disagrees. \"It's not even half that figure,\" he says. \"The Iraqis know very well that most sheikhs are opportunists. They supported Saddam, and now the papers are full of their oaths of allegiance to the new prime minister, Ayad Allawi. In the south of the country, it's mainly the religious sheikhs, the ayatollahs and imams, who have an audience. In the northern cities, and with the exception of remote rural areas and in Kurdish society, most educated people couldn't care less about traditional sheikhs . . . I think it's all a charade.\" </p> <p>A charade it may be, but the new interim Iraqi government, like its American advisers, sees fit to exploit it. The tribal liaison bureau in the interior ministry, which existed under Saddam, has been resuscitated. What did Allawi do when, in early August, he went on his first visit to the holy city of Najaf, where the radical Shia imam, Moqtada al-Sadr, had holed up with his Mahdi army? He met local tribal leaders, asked for their help in dealing with the rebels and thanked four of them on TV for their cooperation. What does a Baghdad doctor or lawyer do when his son is kidnapped for ransom by a gang of hoodlums? He calls in the police, but he also asks for the help of his sheikh, who, after establishing where the kidnapping took place, will contact his local counterpart and bring ancestral alliances and long-standing loyalties into play. </p> <p>\"For us, the tribal system is still a kind of social insurance,\" says Shammari. \"If a problem crops up with the authorities, a neighbour or an employer, you can turn to the sheikh for help. And the sheikh will help you if he can.\" </p> <p>In Rashidiyeh, a bakingly hot palm grove an hour's drive north of Baghdad, Sheikh Dhari Ali al-Fayad is settling a difference between two clan leaders of his tribe. It is apparently \"nothing serious, just a problem over a woman\". Dhari is a true sheikh and supreme chief of the Albu Amer tribe (whose 250,000 members are 75% Shia and 25% Sunni). When he speaks, everyone falls silent. When he rises to his feet, everyone follows suit. At table no one dips his fingers into the huge shared dish of mutton and rice until he gives the signal. </p> <p>The immaculately dressed Dhari, a tall and wiry 74-year-old with heavily lidded eyes, is an iconic figure who looks almost as if he had stepped out of some illustrated history of the Orient. At all times he carries a Beretta pistol in an old black leather holster attached to his right shoulder. \"The Prophet Muhammad - may his name be blessed - said: 'Take a weapon and keep evil at bay.' I obey,\" he says. Dhari has never met King. \"American officers have been to visit me, and we gave them a good reception. These foreigners are not familiar with our traditions. But they rid us of Saddam. They'll leave one day. Meanwhile they are welcome.\" There can be little doubt that sheikhs are back in business.</p>",
  "In the current US election season, Dickie Pilager's <a href=\"http://www.dickiepilager.com/\">website</a> stands out as a model of clarity and vision. Here is the candidate standing before a view of the mountains and lakes of his native Colorado, extolling the virtues of the outdoor life. Here is the family man, praising family life and the American way. And here is the nitty-gritty of his campaign: his views on healthcare, education, gun control, abortion and the environment. <p>Like many other candidates, Dickie Pilager has learned a lesson from Howard Dean and his army of Deaniacs; his website is about involvement, providing a virtual forum for supporters to meet likeminded souls. </p> <p>But there is one aspect in which Mr Pilager is different to most of the other candidates in this election season: he is a work of fiction. </p> <p>Dickie is the lead character in Silver City, a political drama made by the veteran film director John Sayles, which is due to be released in the US today. Made with a budget of just $5.5m (about \u00a33m), the film boasts an ensemble cast of Sayles regulars, including Chris Cooper, Daryl Hannah, Richard Dreyfuss, Kris Kristofferson, Thora Birch and Tim Roth. </p> <p>While documentary makers, with Michael Moore at the forefront, have led cinema's response to the current political mood, narrative films have been slower off the mark. But Sayles has made up for lost time. The director, best known for Lone Star, Limbo and Sunshine State, was prompted to make Silver City by what he saw when filming in Florida during the 2000 presidential election. </p> <p>He told the website Comingsoon.net: \"Many people on our crew and in the community asked, what was the deal with the national media? They're not covering the real story down here, which is not these hanging chads, it's how many African-Americans did not get to vote. </p> <p>\"I've felt like our democracy was under attack from various sides, and it was important to get something out before the election.\"</p> <p>For a director renowned for the subtlety of his films, Sayles's chosen tool was decidedly blunt: satire. Silver City tells the story of the bumbling wayward son of a political dynasty, unable to think on his feet, let alone string a sentence together, who is anointed as the candidate by the business interests that run the state of Colorado. </p> <p>Played by Cooper, most recently seen in The Bourne Identity, Dickie is a dead ringer for George W Bush, from the hesitant bewilderment of his grin to his protean ability to mangle words. His campaign slogan is \"Honesty, integrity, articulacy\". </p> <p>\"We have to get our priorities straight,\" he tells an impromptu gathering of reporters in one scene. \"Education is a priority. Healthcare is a priority. Our economy is a priority. The environmental... the whole environmental arena, that's a priority, a big priority.\" </p> <p>Sayles has not denied the similarity to Bush, saying that Pilager was modelled on the political neophyte when he first ran for governor of Texas. </p> <p>But his target, he claims, is not so much Bush as the system, and his aim is to prompt voters to make the connection between the often incompetent politicians who lead them and the interests that got them elected and direct their energies. </p> <p>Sayles argues that the real villain of the piece is not the candidate but the big businessman, played by Kris Kristofferson. There is, he told National Public Radio in the US, \"a question for all of us, which is: Do we expect our candidates, do we expect our public officials... to actually be people who know anything, who can govern? Or do we expect them to just be mascots for the people who are really running things?\" </p> <p>While the film is unlikely to preach beyond its converted base - Sayles labours under the tag \"liberal film-maker\" - Fahrenheit 9/11 has shown that the impact of a film can be considerable in such a hard-fought election. Already Silver City has attracted the opprobrium of one bastion of conservatism, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News Network, which named it - along with Michael Moore's film and the environmental disaster movie The Day After Tomorrow - Hollywood's contribution to the John Kerry campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Capital Radio could be left \"in a hole\" if GWR decides to turn its back on the much-vaunted merger of the two companies in favour of a deal with media group Emap, say City experts.</p> <p>Speculation is rife that GWR and Capital are on the verge of merging, but the deal is not yet done, and a marriage between GWR and Emap is still a potential alternative.</p> <p>Analysts say Capital is pushing for the merger and it will benefit more from a deal.</p> <p>\"Capital is stuck for growth and has been underperforming in the market for some time. It needs the GWR deal more than anyone. If GWR runs off with someone else [Capital will be] in a hole.</p> <p>\"You're looking at the break-up of Capital if GWR does a deal with Emap,\" said Richard Menzies-Gow, radio analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.</p> <p>Analysts believe Emap's underlying analogue radio business is performing poorly, which GWR could bolster, while Emap's 28% stake in Scottish Radio Holdings may be attractive to GWR's 29.9% shareholder, Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, because of SRH's local newspaper assets.</p> <p>\"There are no significant regulatory issues and Emap's local stations fit better with GWR's - they are locally driven rather than Capital's attempt to drive a Capital-branded local station, said Mr Menzies-Gow.</p> <p>Paul Richards, media analyst at Numis Securities, said he was hopeful that one of the mergers - GWR-Capital or Emap-SRH - will go ahead soon.</p> <p>\"Although radio shares are towards the bottom end of their 12-month range we expect to see an increase in radio prices... there is a general level of industry speculation that things are moving towards a deal.</p> <p>\"It is unlikely that Emap would buy 28% of another quoted company just to sit there. I think something's going to happen in the near term.\"</p> <p>The high price of radio companies at the beginning of the year when consolidation was first allowed under new legislation was thought to be a deterrent to deals but Mr Richards said he foresaw all-share deals being done rather than cash acquisitions, thus negating the price problem.</p> <p>Mr Menzies-Gow pointed out that Emap and GWR were both totally committed to digital radio: \"GWR has Digital One [the national digital multiplex] and good value but does not have brand clout on digital whereas Emap does.\"</p> <p>He added that Emap did not have a big strategic radio thinker since Tim Schoonmaker left last year and Mr Bernard would relish that opportunity.</p> <p>But of the two radio mergers most often mooted - between GWR-Capital and Emap-SRH - he saw \"a lot of barriers to cross\" with the Capital-GWR deal.</p> <p>\"The difficulties lie in convincing DMGT to sell or become shareholders in the bigger business; in how much GWR wants for its digital assets; in the management team - neither [GWR chairman] Ralph Bernard or [Capital Radio chief executive] David Mansfield are going to step down; and [the fact that] their local stations have very different cultures.\" said Mr Menzies-Gow.</p> <p>\"It's not a dream deal, it's a logical one,\" said Mr Menzies-Gow, who estimated the merger's cost savings of between \u00a37m and \u00a39m \"alone justifies trying to bring them together\". </p> <p>One way GWR could realise the value of its digital businesses - national digital radio multiplex Digital One and a data-capture project using digital radio capacity to transmit multimedia content to mobile phones and PDAs - is by spinning them off in to a separate company, said Mr Menzies-Gow.</p> <p>GWR and Capital refused to comment on the speculation.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>The\u00caSpanish ELT industry looks set for a major shake-up after the government in Catalonia announced plans to legislate on a regional accreditation scheme aimed at regulating private education providers.</p> <p>The proposed legislation - the first of its kind in Spain - is in large part a response to the controversial EFL school closures in 2002 and 2003 that left tens of thousands of students in Spain out of pocket and classes.</p> <p>Subsequent lobbying by the Associaci\u00bf de Centres de Formaci\u00f3 No Reglada de Catalunya (Acenorc) has also kept alive the 20-month bi-partisan parliamentary resolution that will formally set minimum requirements for private education and training providers in Catalonia.</p> <p>The legislation is expected to include formal recognition of the sector, regular on-site inspections, implementation of best practice delivery and sanctions against centres that fail to provide appropriate information to clients or fail to meet government labour requirements.</p> <p>While Acenorc represents all unregulated education providers, such as hairdressers and computer colleges, its president, Jos\u00e9 Luis Pal, is a director of the Merit English language school.</p> <p>Pal has been leading negotiations with the Catalan government since late 2002, but the change in national government in Madrid last December stalled the legislative process.</p> <p>\"When new legislation is being debated one has to take into account not only the opinion of our sector but also the views of the public, the consumer and other sectors who might be affected by the changes,\" said Pal.</p> <p>At the same time Acenroc has been working behind the scenes to develop a complementary self-regulatory process for EFL schools.</p> <p>Schools will have to score on a points system covering, among other things, administration of students, care of juniors, publicity and promotion, course design, management of exams, lesson preparation and professional development.</p> <p>Jonathan Dykes, director of International House in Barcelona, estimates that there are around 300-400 EFL schools in Catalonia. \"At this stage I don't think more than 50 or so schools would meet the regulatory criteria we are drawing up,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>In this its 70th year, the British Council cannot afford to look like a venerable institution. While it is independent of government control, it relies on government largesse for close to a third of its $873m annual budget - the rest is generated through its own commercial teaching activities and other consultancy work - so it must prove that its work is relevant in a changing world.</p> <p>The council's core role, as defined in 1940 when it received its Royal Charter, is to promote knowledge about Britain abroad, to develop stronger cultural ties with the rest of the world and to promote knowledge of English.</p> <p>Responsibility for keeping this English teaching role relevant falls, in large part, to John Whitehead. Aged 52 and a council staff member since 1990, he became director of the English Language Teaching group last November. Since then he has been a key player in producing the council's latest five-year plan - Strategy 2010 - launched earlier this year. </p> <p>For council watchers, Strategy 2010 says little new about what the council is trying to achieve - the original charter objectives are now expressed as \"building mutually beneficial relationships between people in the UK and other countries\". The emphasis is on doing this task more efficiently. But the presentation of its work has shifted, with the promotion of British education - courses, skills and products - brought centre stage. </p> <p>Whereas over the last decade the council has highlighted Britain as a dynamic cultural partner for the rest of the world - remember \"cool Britannia\" - and an inspiration to fledgling democracies seeking British \"governance\" skills, over the next five years it is a world hungry for education that will find Britain, and the council, ready to serve.</p> <p>This focus on education is also the product of astute lobbying. Earlier this year the council produced new research with a chilling message: the UK economy could lose up to $7bn a year by 2020 to its competitors if there wasn't immediate investment in international education. And with the government determined to boost numbers of fee-paying foreign students coming to British universities, it was not surprising that the council was rewarded with a 12% increase in its grant (worth $354m by 2008) to help it protect Britain's market share.</p> <p>But how will this shift in emphasis change the council's work in ELT and the way EL learners around the world interact with it? Given that Whitehead leads a team of only 20 people, the answer, he says, lies in stretching his limited resources by mediating better between providers of ELT skills and learners.</p> <p>He also believes that English plays a key role in achieving the council's wider 2010 objectives, but at the same time he is clear that this should not be led by the desire to simply sell British ELT products.</p> <p>\"We are here to help countries develop the capacity of learning and teaching English for their own means, to meet their own agendas,\" he says, citing Iraq as one recent example. The council doesn't have the resources to rebuild schools there (the Iraqi administration's primary request), Whitehead says, but it does have the contacts and expertise to make the most effective use of UK skills providers to achieve Iraq's aim: \"to re-establish English as a major means of accessing the world outside Iraq and becoming part of the international community again.\"</p> <p>The council deserves its reputation for global ELT \"crisis management\" - skills it has honed since the early 1990s when the post-communist countries of Eastern Europe dumped Russian as their second language in education and embraced English. But away from \"transitional\" states with remedial work to be done, the future of the council's ELT presence and role is less clear. It is facing growing competition from other skills providers, while more countries have the capacity to teach English effectively with little outside help.</p> <p>India is a key example. Under the council's previous five-year strategy it was identified as one of the world regions where the council's presence and reach would expand, not in face-to-face teaching, but via the internet. That process is unrolling with a significant share of Whitehead's resources being spent on developing web-based services targeted at India's wealthy middle classes, along side existing teaching centres - what is called its \"blended approach\". </p> <p>But the sudden and largely unpredicted boom in the call-centre industry could put the council in a difficult position. Many of those would-be call-centre workers want traditional face-to-face tuition to improve their English, and foreign ELT providers from international chain schools to national providers like Ausralia's IDP have been rushing in to open schools.</p> <p>Whitehead is sanguine about the way the Indian market is developing, and while he does not have direct responsiblity for the council's 110 commercial teaching centres worldwide, he says that there are no plans to expand capacity in India. \"We don't teach English in teaching centres or run exams to make money. We do it because, like all our other activities, it helps us to achieve our objectives. Otherwise we would just be a language school. Experience shows us that if you go over a certain size, quality is called into question. We are only interested in maintaining and improving the standard of service we deliver to people: we're not in the business of bums of seats.\"</p> <p>But a new way of working for the council will be in collaboration with commercial sponsors. A leading partner so far has been HSBC bank - it has funded the council to carry out EL teacher training in Lebanon and the council has been training HSBC's call centre staff in Sri Lanka. </p> <p>The next phase of the strategy for Whitehead will be to unroll a new internal structure. The world has been divided up into 13 regions and he is introducing a centralised commissioning system that will avoid widely dispersed staff duplicating work. </p> <p>For Whitehead, the council doesn't need to \"reinvent the wheel\" every time it gets a request for help. It is in the business of tweaking what has already proved effective.</p>",
  "Raghda Alassar's classmates did not hear the Israeli bullet that tore into the nine-year-old's brain as she wrote an English test. But as a pool of blood spread across her desk and spilled on to the floor, a wall of screams rose from the classroom of the UN elementary school for girls in Khan Yunis. <p>At that point Raghda was still crying for help. By the time she was hauled into the trauma room of a neighbouring hospital she was silent. </p> <p>For five crucial days the army blocked Raghda's transfer to an Israeli hospital with the facilities to offer a glimmer of hope. An infection set in. </p> <p>On Tuesday doctors told her father, Adnad, that she was brain dead. </p> <p>\"The bullet entered under her eye and went out the back of her head,\" Mr Alassar said. </p> <p>\"It took them a long time to stop the bleeding, and her heart stopped and they gave her shocks. From that moment she was like a dead body, although she wasn't dead.\" </p> <p>\"I find it so difficult to believe what happened to my daughter. She was at school, just carrying her notebook, not a gun. What is my daughter - nine years old - guilty of that she has to be shot? It's state terror against the whole population.\" </p> <p>In recent weeks the Israelis have again been preoccupied with terrorism, from the murder of 16 people in the Beersheba bus bombings to the slaughter of Russian schoolchildren in Beslan, which received blanket coverage. </p> <p>During the six months of relative peace for Israelis, until the Beersheba bombings, the army killed more than 400 Palestinians. Most were fighters, but they also included about 40 children under 15. Palestinians say this also is a form of terror. </p> <p>\"We're always listening for the helicopters, listening for the tanks, listening for the bombs,\" said Khitam abu Shawarib, the only social worker in Rafah refugee camp, on the southern tip of the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>\"I am very sorry when I hear of a Jewish woman or children killed. I think it is wrong and many people here think it is wrong. But what the Jews suffer is nothing to the terror we live with from them. </p> <p>\"It takes such a toll on our health, on society, most of all on the children.\" </p> <p>Israelis live in fear of random attacks, principally the suicide bombing of buses and cafes, and shootings in the occupied territories. But they are generally safe in their homes and are more likely to be killed in a road accident than by a bomb. </p> <p>In southern Gaza and parts of the West Bank there is often no sanctuary from the seemingly relentless, indiscriminate Israeli shooting. </p> <p>Israel classifies Gaza Strip towns such as Rafah and Khan Yunis, and Nablus and Jenin in the West Bank, as war zones. </p> <p>That, the army says, justifies the firing of powerful sophisticated weapons into residential areas or the bulldozing of scores of homes each month, ostensibly in search of rarely discovered tunnels for smuggling in weapons. </p> <p>Barely a night passes in Rafah or Khan Yunis without the machine-gun fire that has shredded hundreds of homes, forcing families to sleep in a single inner room behind bricked up windows or a second wall. </p> <p>Others live in the rubble of their bulldozed houses, perpetually in the firing line from the rarely seen soldiers high in the gun towers. </p> <p>A fortnight ago 15-year-old Mazen al-Ara was trying to lead his siblings away from tanks and heavy shooting around their house on the edge of the \"Philadelphi Road\", the highly militarised border at Rafah. </p> <p>The army had partially destroyed the family home months before, but the Aras went on living there because they had no money to move. </p> <p>Usually they sheltered in an inner room when the shooting began, but that night it was so intense that Mazen said they would all be killed if they stayed. </p> <p>As he led the terrified group into the street, Mazen was caught by a burst of fire. The boy died; doctors took 18 bullets from his body. </p> <p>A few days earlier 10-year-old Munir al-Daqas left his home in Jabalya refugee camp to visit his grandparents' house five minutes' walk away. Israeli tanks were on the far side of the camp, but no one saw any danger in the heart of Jabalya, around its bustling market, in daylight. </p> <p>\"It must have been a sniper,\" his mother, Kifah, said. \"People told me as I was shopping in the market. I couldn't believe it. Munir was just there with me and now they were saying he was dead.\" </p> <p>Mrs Daqas unfolded a picture of the semi-naked body of her son in his grave. There is a bullet wound in the chest and another in the groin. </p> <p>In four years of intifada, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights says, the army has killed 136 children in Rafah and Khan Yunis, a quarter of all the Palestinian children who have died during the uprising, because of its \"indiscriminate shooting, excessive force, a shoot-to-kill policy and the deliberate targeting of children\". </p> <p>The dead in Khan Yunis and Rafah in recent weeks also include two 12-year-old boys, a 15-year-old girl and a 75-year-old man in a wheelchair, Ibrahim Halfalla, who was crushed under the rubble of his own home by an army bulldozer as his wife begged the soldiers not to advance. </p> <p>The army has not offered an explanation for the killing of Raghda Alassar, but it frequently says that child victims are caught in crossfire during Palestinian attacks on the army or Jewish settlers. </p> <p>There were no such battles when Raghda Alassar and Munir Daqas were hit. Or when a bullet pierced the blind of Sara Zorob's living room and struck the 10-year-old in the chest, killing her instantly. </p> <p>Commanders in Gaza have admitted in the past that when their soldiers are attacked they are allowed to fire back randomly, risking civilian lives. </p> <p>There are other young victims, as well. </p> <p>\"The children who are physically injured are not the only ones harmed,\" said Usama Freona, a psychologist at the UN clinic in Rafah. </p> <p>\"The levels of violence children are exposed to is horrific. </p> <p>\"We work in a lot of schools to treat the children. In the one next to Kfar Darom [a Jewish settlement in Gaza], all the children are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Most of them were crying and shaking when they were speaking about their experiences. There is a lot of bedwetting.\" </p> <p>Mohammed abu Yusuf is the counsellor at Raghda Alassar's school. </p> <p>\"After Raghda was shot,\" he said, \"the children were crying and screaming. Five girls in her class still won't come back to school. We took Raghda's desk away and brought another but none of the students will sit at it.\" </p> <p>Raghda Alassar is not the first child shot at the cluster of UN schools in Khan Yunis. Last year an Israeli bullet blinded Huda Darwish, 12, as she sat at her desk. </p> <p>Mrs Daqas said her other children could not comprehend Munir's death. </p> <p>\"Munir's younger brother doesn't understand he is dead. He thought he would come back after the funeral and kept asking why Munir has come when we've had 'the party' for him. His four-year-old sister asks every day if we can search the market because Munir must be lost,\" she said. </p> <p>Mr Freona said the constant violence begets violence. </p> <p>\"Look at the games children play. Most of the boys play Arabs and Jews. Many want to play the role of the Jews. They see that the Israeli soldiers are the ones with the guns and they are strong and they see that is the most important thing,\" he said. </p> <p>\"They see guns as the source of power, the solution to dealing with any problem, the way to get what they want.\" </p> <p>With that has come a collapse in respect for authority. </p> <p>The image of Mohammed al-Dura, the 12-year-old Gaza boy shot as his father vainly tried to protect him from Israeli gunfire in the first days of the latest intifada, is seared on the Palestinian consciousness. </p> <p>It has come to symbolise what they see as the callous indifference of Israeli forces to the lives of their children. But Mrs Abu Shawarib said it had a further impact on many children, who saw that a father was unable to protect his son. </p> <p>\"The respect for authority is shattered because children see their fathers beaten in front of them,\" she said. \"The authority of the father, who used to just have to utter one word for the child to obey, is shattered. The father looks helpless to protect the child and the child thinks they are alone.\" </p> <p>Another result of the perpetual killing was that many children came to expect an early death and to welcome the prospect of becoming a \"martyr\". </p> <p>\"The martyr is in paradise, he has glory here and in the afterlife where it is so much better than life in Rafah,\" she said. \"The children see many people killed, so they come to expect to be killed. This is horrible, that children should accept the possibility of death.\"</p>",
  "<p>We can all think of our funniest moment from a film and this is a sure way to start up a conversation. This ability to recall memorable scenes can also be transferred to the EFL class to optimise students' learning experience.</p> <p>So why are films such a rewarding tool in the language classroom? First, students all over the world love watching them. Second, students are familiar with the plots as well as the actors. Finally - from the teaching perspective - the type of language used is real-life language, which has not been adapted for teaching purposes.</p> <p>It can be argued that learners not exposed to so-called \"learner language\" are likely to be put off. This might be true for whole films. However, with short clips we can catch students' attention and even make them eager to understand. Film extracts are easy to use, fun and, in these days of DVDs, easily accessible. Almost any film has parts that you can adapt to a variety of language teaching situations at all levels. Here are some activities that illustrate how to exploit films for language work rather than content.</p> <p>Imagine the following situation: you teach a presentation course and need an attention-catching introduction to demonstrate how not to present. Why not take Bridget Jones's Diary? There is a book launch where Bridget (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) introduces the author who is going to talk about his latest book. For presentation training this situation features many \"don'ts\" we usually try to make our students aware of: there's no eye-contact, no audience awareness, bad posture, giggling, wrong register etc. The clip is short, easy to grasp, very funny and, above all, an excellent example of a really bad speech. </p> <p>As a task, ask students, while watching, to write down all the mistakes Bridget makes. Then they come up with ideas on how the speech can be improved. A follow-up is to have students do such a presentation themselves: they introduce someone to an audience in a formal setting. Afterwards, in the feedback round, compare the students' performance to Bridget's, which helps strengthen the students' self-confidence. If you want to show a perfect presentation, Helen Hunt in What Women Want delivers one that is just the thing.</p> <p>If you teach beginners, you can use film extracts to teach or revise vocabulary. For example You've Got Mail offers a great variety of teaching material. Close to the beginning there is a scene in which Meg Ryan walks to work early in the morning through the streets of New York. She passes shops, stores, market stalls etc. There is only music, no dialogue. Students watch the sequence twice and each time after watching they write down all the things they can remember seeing. You can easily extend this vocabulary activity into a brainstorming or mind-mapping competition by asking your students: which people work in these shops? (jobs); describe the daily routine of these people (present simple); what can you buy in these shops, and how much do these things cost (vocabulary, money)? This type of activity is fruitful with any age group and level. And the language level only depends on the scene that you choose.</p> <p>Films obviously offer a great source of dialogue and thus an endless number of activities. Take a dialogue you find suitable and tell the students to write down what one character is saying while watching the clip. This can be done as pair work: A writes down what A says, B writes down what B says. You will have to show the extract several times. Then check with the whole class and ask them to read and role-play the conversation to practise intonation and pronunciation. This dictation activity makes students forget they are writing a dictation. </p> <p>One of my favourite films for practising dialogue in a slightly different way is How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. There is a scene in which \"she\" (Kate Hudson) meets \"him\" (Matthew McConaughey). Their first date includes mostly one-word remarks, which makes it ideal for social English, conversation classes or simply to jazz up a tired class. Type out the dialogue and cut it into pieces. Before watching, learners put it together.</p> <p>You could then analyse the situation asking them who is talking to whom, what they are speaking about etc. Play the scene only to let the students correct their work. Then they role play the conversation by reading it or acting it out. When using films with intermediate and advanced students it is helpful to download reviews from the internet. For example, English Learner Movie Guide (www.eslnotes.com) offers character descriptions, plot summaries as well as words and expressions of currently more than 50 films (classics and modern) that can be downloaded in three different formats.</p> <p>And a final tip - Lost in Translation is out on DVD. Don't miss it because you can use this film to deal with cross-cultural topics and get students to talk about personal experiences.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Elke Beder is a freelance language consultant based in Graz, Austria, and a trainer for the Norwich Institute for Language Education, England, bedere@net4you.co.at</p>",
  "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs yesterday announced \"changes to the licensing system\" for the control of the cormorant population. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation welcomed the decision, describing it as a significant increase in \"species management\". What these weasel words mean is that people with licences will now be empowered to shoot up to 3,000 of these birds instead of the current limit of 300. With Defra's deft timing this was announced the day after the House of Commons had voted for a ban on hunting with dogs. Unlike foxhunting, the decision needs no legislative approval, though the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds may challenge this claim in the courts. <p>In theory, this could create a timely opportunity for hunters to fill the void in their lives by shooting cormorants instead of chasing foxes - and staying this side of the legal divide. But life is not so simple. For a start, the hunters would have to get off their high horses. What it does illustrate is the thin line in species management separating hunting (bad) from culling (bad but environmentally necessary). Whatever happens to hunting with dogs, foxes will continue to be culled in other ways. Cormorants, for their part, have committed no offence other than to have expanded in numbers (after facing near-extinction) and to have moved inland to indulge their ravenous fish-eating in our ever cleaner rivers. </p> <p>Technology might offer a solution here. It would be relatively simple to devise a computer game in which real foxes in the fields might have global positioning microchips embedded in them as part of a multi-player game in which thousands of people around the world chase them with packs of virtual dogs on their computer screens. Participants would get all the thrill of the chase without a real fox being killed. In this way hunting could escape the wrath of the anti-blood sports lobbies. The trouble is that it would trigger an equally violent reaction from the anti-video violence lobbies. We always knew there was no simple solution to this problem.</p>",
  "In everyone's life there is a defining event that steers them off the path they were steadily treading. For me it was my daughter Caoimhe's birth. It was not just her diagnosis that knocked me, but the sheer unexpectedness of it. I had limped through a difficult childhood but in my 20s jobs, boyfriends, opportunities had rattled into place like pieces in a child's shape-sorter. While I put it all down to good fortune, a quiet voice inside me believed you made your own luck. If I ate the right food, worked hard, was a nice person, then I would reap the rewards. Then came Caoimhe, a child with a disability, and the tenets of my existence shattered like glass. <p>It has been a year since she was born, close to midnight, still intact in her amniotic sac. One of the sadnesses I carry is that the joyful memories of her birth have been overlaid by the shocking ones of her diagnosis, so that the edges of them are grey and frayed. But I vaguely remember seeing her face squashed against the membranes like a doll wrapped in plastic, a rare event, which the old wives say is a sign of luck. </p> <p>When she was a few months old, I developed a sore throat and took her with me to the GP. As I was leaving, the doctor, a brisk red-faced woman with a booming voice, looked at Caoimhe kicking happily in her pram and asked: \"Down's?\" Just like that. The entity of my daughter encapsulated in a short sharp question. \"Yes,\" I replied meekly. The GP asked my age and then computed the stats in her head. \"Ah yes, a one in 350 chance. It's a lottery out there and you were unlucky.\" </p> <p>Was I? In those first few weeks of early pregnancy we almost lost her when a scan showed internal bleeding. She was given a less than 10% chance of survival. After that scare the knot of anxiety was ever present. We considered ourselves lucky when a 20-week scan showed a healthy baby moving around my womb like a spaceman in a capsule. Nine hours after her birth, her diagnosis burst the honeymoon bubble that encompasses new parenthood; this time I had really lost her. </p> <p>For the first few months of her life, joy and grief had me in a tug-of-war. She was a beautiful baby, but she had a disability. When I was alone with her, when it was just us two, we were mother and child, locked in a rhythm as old as life. Then came the medics in their white coats and stethoscopes, who would poke her and prod her, slice her heels with a razor to draw blood so they could peer at her extra chromosome through a microscope. The prognosis seemed gloomy; babies with Down's not only looked funny but brought with them a whole heap of health problems just waiting to be fixed. Never once after my other two daughters' births did anyone sit me down and reel off a catalogue of woe that might burden me in the ensuing years; glue-sniffing, promiscuity, broken limbs and hearts, and various diseases. </p> <p>Hours after Caoimhe's birth, the obstetrician was talking about her \"intellectual deficit\". At the time it did nothing but fill the emptiness created by her diagnosis with churning worry. Would she read a book? Write her name? Sing a song? Now I feel angry. How demeaning to measure a person by their IQ. Still, I admit that intelligence was just one of those things I took for granted, never questioning the value that I placed on it. My partner is doing a PhD in brain science. My two other daughters are quick-witted and sharp as new teeth. Caoimhe had landed with an awkward thump in the middle of a cerebral family - what on earth were we going to do? </p> <p>But God, how I loved her. It took just a look from those dark fathomless eyes, a touch, to bring me back to the dreamy, fantastic present that is the rite of passage of every new mother. </p> <p>When I brought her home from the hospital it had been raining and the world was a different place from when I had left it four days ago. Sharper, glassier, somehow. People seemed different, too. They did not know how to respond to the new me, so some chose not to respond at all. When Caoimhe was six weeks old I took her to a party where her diagnosis was never mentioned. People came over to chat politely and then flitted away like butterflies in search of something brighter, tastier. At one point Caoimhe and I were sitting on a couch in an empty room. </p> <p>On another occasion, when Conor and I met up with some friends at a concert in the park, we found ourselves being ignored. During our attempts to initiate forced and cheery conversation, it was as if Caoimhe did not exist. Despite her smile, as wide as a slash in an apple, they didn't even give her a glance. </p> <p>On the drive home Conor's knuckles were white with anger, and Caoimhe screamed uncharacteristically. Did she know, I wondered, that there were people out there who would rather she was not around? Who found her too confronting to be in her presence? When I got home I cried buckets for all the averted gazes she was yet to meet, for the blank stares she will puzzle over, for the sniggers and whispers that will confuse and hurt her. </p> <p>I scoured the media for photos of babies with Down's syndrome but there were virtually none. I looked for children's books, but the only one I could find was My Brother Stephen is Retarded. No thanks. Ethnic children are well represented in the scientific texts of baby management, cookbooks show cheerful jelly babies waving spoons, but the disabled child simply does not exist. My response was to dress Caoimhe in vibrant clashing colours. Forget dusky pinks and pastels, my child was going to be seen. </p> <p>Her wardrobe was a diversion from the reality of life, which in those early months was too often fraught and grim. Caoimhe was more than 7lbs at birth but was slowly and steadily failing to thrive. When I was not pouring milk into her hungry red mouth, I was attached to a pump, expressing it into a bottle. Day and night I was hijacked to my rocking chair, but it made no difference. She was hospitalised and x-rayed for webbing in her gut; there was none. </p> <p>One night as I stripped her for her bath, that ever-present knot of anxiety in my stomach did a double twist: she looked like a little scrap of tinned salmon, a bony chain of spine poking through the pink flesh. After that I could not bath her, I could not bear to look. Then an idea came to me: our eldest daughter has coeliac disease and so I went on a gluten-free, dairy-free diet. Within 24 hours she had stopped vomiting and the frothy green nappies subsequently vanished. </p> <p>With her weight under control, we had more time to worry about the relentless round of appointments that crowded our calendar like a debutante's dates. Eye tests, hearing tests, blood tests, more hearing tests. Time after time the tests came up negative. No hearing problem, no vision problem, no leukaemia. The more specialists we saw, the more my daughter receded from me until she became an object scrutinised by quality control. </p> <p>With every cold - and there are many - I fear, at best, an ear infection, at worst, death. All the books I have read on Down's syndrome make sober references to the children's extra-narrow respiratory passages where evil bugs lurk and fester; when my back is turned they will march unrelentingly up the tight tunnels of her ear canals and commandeer her brain. </p> <p>When I'm not worrying about her health, it is her development. At 12 months she is not crawling, and visits a physiotherapist once a fortnight. I try to assign this responsibility to her father because physio is brutal and in the early days it would often end in a mingling of her tears and mine. To stop her legs splaying, we have to shackle her thighs with sweatbands stitched together. Our house is filled with giant foam shapes on loan from a specialist toy library, which will help to get her mobile. Sometimes her vulnerability catches me in the throat when I see her on the floor gamely struggling with her exercises while her dad sings \"Hey, hey, hey de ho, the great big elephant is so slow\". </p> <p>I went through a phase of believing that every moment in her life had to be a learning opportunity. I'd chat to her endlessly about my day, telling her what I was doing in bright primary vernacular: \"Look Caoimhe. Mammy's baking a cake. Here's an egg. Look, I'm cracking the egg. Look Caoimhe, mammy's cracking up.\" For a time I felt I was. I remember overhearing Wynnie, my middle child, sadly saying to herself: \"Mammy only likes babies,\" and felt that serrated knife of guilt twist in another inch. Meanwhile Caoimhe would watch her all-singing, all-dancing mother from her highchair, head slightly cocked to one side, gentle eyes quizzical. </p> <p>Over the year, my love for Caoimhe has become all-consuming, intense, passionate but not perfect. There are times when I am angry with her for arriving like a cuckoo in the wrong nest. These fleeting moments drift like floaters across my eyes and are more prominent when I feel overwhelmed with the responsibility of it all. That is not to say that it is not rewarding: it is. At 12 months Caoimhe is not so very far behind her sisters when they were that age. She can say mama and dada, delights in pulling her sisters' hair, plays ball, bangs blocks and bugs the hell out of the cat. Socially, she is streets ahead and possesses a remarkable knack of engaging people. </p> <p>I wish I had known 12 months ago what I know now. In those bleak, dark days in hospital, one of my biggest fears was that I would not like her, would be ashamed of her. </p> <p>Never. Here she is, a little girl on the eve of her first birthday, so close to crawling away from me towards a life of her own. Her ready smile is only a second away, her love abundant but discerning, with the best bits saved only for me. Life with Caoimhe is life distilled to its purest essence, to love and be loved. This is her present to me. Happy birthday, beautiful girl.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's retail sales unexpectedly bounced back last month as shoppers apparently shrugged off the Bank of England's five interest rate rises since November. Economists had forecast a decline in sales in August after survey data suggested bad weather kept shoppers away from stores. </p> <p>The better than expected retail figures meant further rises in the cost of borrowing by the Bank of England were likely, said economists. </p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said sales rose by 0.6% in August, compared to a decline of 0.6% in the previous month, to stand 6.5% up on a year earlier. </p> <p>In recent weeks, a slowdown in the retail sector and signs of a weakening of the housing market had led some analysts to believe that the cost of borrowing had reached its peak at 4.75%. </p> <p>Analysts said the strength of retail sales meant the consumer slowdown was not yet a \"done deal\" and now expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates by a further 0.25% to 5% by the end of the year. </p> <p>\"[The figures] support our view that recent suggestions that interest rates have already peaked are too premature,\" said Paul Dales at Capital Economics. </p> <p>Despite the better than expected data, city analysts warned that the consumer boom would slow over the rest of the year. </p> <p>\"Looking forward, we think that sales growth will slow sharply as higher interest rates start to pinch and consumer confidence fades away as the housing market slowdown gathers pace,\" added Mr Dales. </p> <p>Clothing and footwear sales performed well with volumes up by 3.7%, the fastest rate since June 2003. Annual growth increased by 9.3%, thanks to prices being nearly 6% lower than last year. </p> <p>A slower rise in clothing and footwear prices for August compared to last year helped to push down the overall consumer price index to 1.3%. Prices in August usually rise after the end of the summer sales. </p> <p>The bounce-back in August clothing sales recorded by the official snapshot, contradicts recent survey data that suggests that exceptionally wet weather kept shoppers away, especially from clothing retailers. </p> <p>Some analysts say that the cold, wet weather in August may have encouraged shoppers to bring forward their winter wardrobe purchases. \"This is a zero-sum game though so clothing sales may suffer throughout the rest of the autumn,\" said Alan Castle, at Lehman Brothers. </p> <p>Separately, US data showed consumer prices rising by only 0.1% on the month in August, confirming economists' feeling that inflation in the world's largest economy remains under control in spite of rising oil prices. </p> <p>In the eurozone, the second-estimate inflation for August was confirmed at an annual 2.3%, above the European Central Bank's target of 2% but a decrease from the recent peak of 2.5% in May. Core inflation - excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco - rose to 1.9% from 1.8% in July.</p>",
  "<p>We're talking conspiracies. Spike Lee loves talking conspiracies. He reckons most of life is one conspiracy or another. His new film She Hate Me is about a whistleblower who exposes corporate corruption and is sacked for it. Whistleblowers, he says, are invariably the fall guys - heroes for 15 minutes, if that, then scapegoats. The film has a fantasy sequence about Frank Wills, the security guard and Watergate whistleblower who died, destitute, age 52. \"Look at all the other guys involved, all those crooks, all the presidents' men - they went on to successful careers but no one would employ Frank Wills. Look at Haldeman, Gordon Liddy, all those guys made a ton of money writing books, being TV show hosts, they had well respected lives and whatever, and Frank Wills is buried somewhere and forgotten.\" </p> <p>Never was a man so aptly nicknamed. (Lee was christened Shelton). He's in typically spiky form, licking his lips as he makes each point. \"I hope people in the audience connect David Kelly to the film because he was a whistleblower.\" Typically, Lee customises the reference for the British. Lee's political education extends way beyond America, and he is something of an Anglophile. He supports Arsenal when he comes to London, and throws the word \"bollocks\" around with lavish abandon. </p> <p>\"I don't believe he committed suicide,\" he says. \"I don't think he would tell his wife 'Oh I'm going for a walk in the park', I mean if you want to commit suicide, he'd just go in the bathroom and slit his wrists or go in the garage and blow his brains out, you know. Somebody wanted him dead.\" </p> <p>Has Lee always been a conspiracy theorist? He looks round the room, with a conspiratorial grin, and starts talking extremely loudly as if to double bluff any potential eavesdroppers. \"Well I mean I was talking to friends ... hahahaha! Just joking, but it's as plain as day he did not commit suicide.\" Which, of course, takes us on to weapons of mass destruction, and the Blair-Bush relationship, and another conspiracy. \"A lot of people are scratching their heads - like what does Bush have on Blair and what does Blair have on Bush. Well ... \" Silence. </p> <p>She Hate Me is not only a satire on the greed of companies such as Tyco, Enron and Adelphia, it is also a satire on Bushism itself - the opening credits show $3 bills with Bush's face on and a fake politicial advertisement against affirmative action. \"I think the election coming up is gonna be the most important election in the history of the United States of America, cos God save us all ... \" He trails off in despair. \"God save the world if Bush is re-elected. Heaven help us. Wooooh!\" </p> <p>To say the new movie is about corporate corruption and Bushism barely begins to tell the story. She Hate Me is, in effect, two films: a political thriller and a sex comedy. The jobless and broke protagonist Jack Armstrong accepts a financial offer from his former fiancee, now a lesbian, to impregnate her and her girlfriend. From, there, he goes on to father 19 children to lesbians. She Hate Me is messy, sprawling, ridiculous and entertaining. It's a strange mix of the liberal (accepting of lesbians mums) and reactionary (ultimately, none of the lesbians can resist Jack Armstrong's priapic charm). It's both sexually explicit and childlike - soft porn brought to you by Walt Disney. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Lee has now been attacked by lesbian groups for She Hate Me - after all, this is a movie in which one guy ends up doing the do with 19 gorgeous lipstick lesbians, and finally settles down to domestic life with a couple of them. So Spike, I say, isn't this the ultimate male-fantasy film? He looks at me, all wide-eyed innocence. \"It is not a male fantasy. I say that for this reason. It might be a male fantasy to sleep with two lesbians, it's definitely not a male fantasy to marry two lesbians. So that's where the fantasy ended,\" he laughs, happily digging himself into ever deeper trouble. \"We knew going in that it would be impossible to make a film that all lesbians are going to love. But the lesbian popualtion is not monolithic. You're going to get people who are open to the film then you are going to get your hard-liners who feel that any self-respecting lesbian can't be a lesbian if there is a penis in the equation.\" </p> <p>Perhaps it's not so much the penis, I say, it's the thing attached to it. \"Well, you may have to do your own poll to supplement this article.\" </p> <p>The criticism of the film is perfectly valid - it is an outlandish portrait of lesbians for the lads. But it's also missing the point somewhat- She Hate Me is a comedy, not a political treatise. Yet, as in the past, Lee is expected to represent \"the black experience\", or \"the lesbian experience\". When he talks about homosexuality he does so with a great deal more insight than shown in the movie. </p> <p>I ask him whether he could have made this film 10 years ago. \"No, because I don't think I was evolved as far as homosexuality.\" In what way? \"Well you just evolve, you grow. If you'd asked me 15 years ago, 'Spike do you think men should be able to marry each other? Do you think women should be able to marry each other', I would say I don't know. Today I say I'm cool with it.\" </p> <p>But isn't there still a massive problem with homophobia in the African-American community? \"Well, it's not just black men, but I will say that black men are probably more homophobic than other groups of people. I mean there is a big stigma in the African-American community for homosexuals. Big, big, big, big , big.\" </p> <p>Is that changing.? \"No. There's a new phenomenon in America that's called 'on the down low'. This is men who have unprotected sex with other men, then have unprotected sex with their wives and girlfriends, and their wives and girlfriends don't know they are engaging in unprotected sex with men. That's why African-American women are the group most at risk of contracting HIV. These men don't think they're gay. My reasoning is that the stigma of being a homosexual is so great in the African-American community that these men have convinced themselves they are straight. And they are homophobic too. Anything effeminate, they'll be the first one to call anybody a faggot or a punk, and they will swear on a stack of bibles and look Jesus in the eye and say they are not gay. And that's a very serious problem.\" </p> <p>Lee emerged in the mid-1980s with She's Gotta Have It, a tender, sexy black-and-white no-budget movie about one girl and her boyfriends. There followed a series of brilliant films including Jungle Fever, Clockers and, most notably, Do the Right Thing. He also managed to make a mainstream movie about the militant Malcolm X, a poignant drama out of the Million Man March (Get on the Bus), and the devastating documentary, 4 Little Girls, about the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama. </p> <p>Do the Right Thing portrayed the simmering racial conflict of late 1980s New York, and in doing so defined a generation. Incredibly, Lee was accused of acting irresponsibly and inciting people to riot when the character Mookie, played by Lee himself, threw a dustbin through the window of the pizzeria where he worked. And this in a Hollywood where epic gratuitous violence is a staple. </p> <p>But in a way perhaps it wasn't so incredible. After all, Lee has been accused of a number of things through his career, many of them contradictory or simply daft: of being a racist and black separatist (for making films about black people), of not being working class, of coming from a privileged background, of being a leftie, of being a capitalist with a clothing and advertising company. At times, there seems to be one set of rules for film-makers and another for Spike Lee. He nods. \"Well sometimes they do seem to put up higher standards for me that don't apply to other film-makers.\" Does it still happen? \"Not to the same degree, but it's still there.\" </p> <p>Perhaps Lee's politics caused such confusion for British people because they didn't fit into neat left-right pockets. Anyway, he says, he never advocated economic separatism. \"That was ballocks,\" he says relishing the word but rounding it off too sweetly. No, I say, it's an O sound, and you have to give it a harder, flatter sound at the end. He giggles. \"Bollox,\" he says. Well done, I say. </p> <p>\"Well, here's the thing: I never saw a division between being politically active and making money. In the US we live under the capitalistic system and I do think there's a way to make an honest living without being responsible for people's ill will or death. I mean, 'How dare you do a commercial, how dare you do a film like Do the Right Thing and then do a commercial, I mean ... '\" And he tumbles to a stop, lost for words. He leans into the microphone and almost burps the word \"bollocks\" into it. Now he's got the giggles. \"Ballux,\" he says again. \"I only use bollocks when I'm over here.\" </p> <p>I ask Lee if he he's changed politically over the years. \"I think I've become more astute, more aware. I'm trying to stop doing knee-jerk reactionary stuff and trying to study a little bit more and deliberate more before I open my mouth.\" </p> <p>Can he give an example of his knee-jerkism? \"Before I had children I said I would never take my kids to see a Disney movie, and that's one of the most ignorant statements I've ever made because if you have children you'd definitely take them - you have no other choice.\" </p> <p>Which leads us back to his favourite topics: movies and conspiracies. He talks about the film-makers he loves most - Kurosawa, Fellini, Coppola, Scorsese, Stone, early Truffaut and Godard.\" Ah, Jean Seberg, I say, wasn't she wonderful in A Bout de Souffle, and how tragic that she killed herself. He gives me a look and shakes his head. \"Jean Seberg, she hung out with the Black Panthers you know. I think the FBI had something to do with her death because she was a Black Panther sympathiser.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> She Hate Me is out on September 24.</p>",
  "<p>What is it with detective stories and classical music? From The Woman in White, via the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Lord Peter Wimsey and Tintin, to Inspector Morse and the gay sleuths of Phillip Scott or Grant Michaels, there are hundreds of novels in which the two come together. Sometimes the music helps not so much to soothe as to reveal the savage breast. In the Wilkie Collins thriller, it is a tirade about the genius of Rossini - \"What was Moses in Egypt but a sublime oratorio, which was acted on the stage instead of being coldly sung in a concert-room? What was the overture to Guillaume Tell but a symphony under another name?\" - which helps to confirm the evil nature of the villain Count Fosco to our heroine, Marian Halcombe. \"There was something horrible - something fierce and devilish - in the outburst of delight at his own singing and playing ...\"</p> <p>Thirty years later she could have called in Sherlock Holmes. Conan Doyle made his hero a keen violinist, \"a composer of no ordinary merit\" and the author of a monograph upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus, \"said by experts to be the last word upon the subject\". Whenever a case is over, Holmes drags Watson off to a violin recital or opera performance with the tenacity of Jill Archer boiling the kettle for a cuppa in Ambridge: \"By the way, it is not eight o'clock, and a Wagner night at Covent Garden! If we hurry, we might be in time for the second act.\" (The Adventure of the Red Circle); \"I have a box for Les Huguenots. Have you heard the De Reszkes?\" (they're off to see Queen Victoria's favourite singers, right after saving Sir Henry from The Hound of the Baskervilles).</p> <p>The detective as musical amateur was to become an affectionate tic in British crime fiction. Dorothy L Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey, a pianist of \"some skill and more understanding\", gets involved with a seaside orchestra (which, in Have His Carcass, is apparently able enough to close a morning programme with Beethoven's Eroica), numerous 1920s and 30s avant-garde concerts (some fun poked in Strong Poison at the Walton/ Sitwell Facade performances) and a thinly disguised Oxford Bach Choir (Gaudy Night).</p> <p>In the inter-war golden age of crime fiction, classical music is often just there to be name-checked as a status guide to the social and intellectual standing of leading (and \"good\") characters. Or it can be comic: opera is inevitably performed by loud, fat, Mediterranean \"foreigners\", like Castafiore, the soprano who appears in several Tintin adventures and drives his pal Captain Haddock to drink. More serious attention to an investigator's passion for music came later. In Len Deighton's Funeral in Berlin (1964) the unnamed, laconic spy hero continually comes across people inviting him to hear Schoenberg's Variations for Wind Band - which becomes a kind of leitmotif for the success of his mission. His double agent opponent Johnny Vulkan is said (shades of Holmes) to have \"written an analysis of Bartok's string quartets which will shatter the music world when it's published\".</p> <p>Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse is a serious music-lover too, a man who (in the books, at least) curls his nose up at visitors who don't recognise the Bruckner symphony he is playing on his home stereo. In the weeks before his death, Morse is persuaded by the faithful, but apparently uncultured, Sergeant Lewis to listen to a recording of Wagner's Ring cycle (Solti's) previously outside the carefully defined pale of his collection. It's all good record-bore fun that never gets in the way of the mystery. But probably the best music-performance discussion in literature comes in Raymond Chandler's Playback, his last finished book. A most convincing debate between private eye Philip Marlowe and a senior desk sergeant about the relative merits of pianists Arthur Rubinstein and Artur Schnabel playing Mozart, it comes completely out of left-field - both for its placing in the book (Marlowe has been detained overnight in jail on a trumped-up charge) and for Chandler, who cultivated a deliberately culture-free zone for his tales of America's \"mean streets\".</p> <p>Gaston Leroux's much-adapted but now rarely read The Phantom of the Opera (1910) centred on three themes: hiding behind another persona, frustrated artistic ambition and the opportunities for crime provided by the artificial, secretive world of opera house or concert hall. They still resonate throughout many less convincingly researched successors. Amelia R Long's Symphony in Murder starts by apparently fulfilling a favourite orchestral player's fantasy: shooting the conductor in mid-performance. Was it the Philadelphia Philharmonic's German concertmaster, who, \"if he can love anybody beside Hitler\" (the book's chauvinist tone is explained by its 1940 publication date), shared the maestro's partiality for flautist Miss Trevis? Another German, the glockenspiel player (bewilderingly present in the line-up for Beethoven Five), helps the detective to point the finger at the maestro himself: \"It was your final downbeat that drew from the orchestra sufficient sound vibration to fire the shot ... the heavy reverberation of the brasses and percussion that touched off the hair-trigger of a pistol\".</p> <p>More apparent science informs the solution to a much better read, E C R Lorac's The Organ Speaks. Shanstone, orchestra leader and composer, discovers that organist Anthony Loudon is also the dreaded critic signing himself Omega - he will surely expose the fact that Shanstone's new Quintet is plagiarised from another contemporary's work. So when Loudon plays a \"certain requiem\" in a \"recital of Victorian masterpieces\", musically literate detective Macdonald (\"I'm not such a fool as you think me\") deduces that \"someone connected a live wire to the back of the Cornopean draw-stop and to the steel Swell-pedal; when Loudon touched them both at the same time he formed a complete circuit and he was killed\". An enjoyable aspect of the book is the evocation of mid-1930s London concert life with conversation about Sir Adrian Boult (\"a very good man. He drills 'em like a schoolmaster ... he's got an intelligent face\") and even Lauri Kennedy (Nigel Kennedy's father), \"superb in that colloquy between piano and cello in the slow movement\" of Brahms Piano Concerto No 2.</p> <p>Lorac, really Edith Caroline Rivett, has serious fans, a German website claiming a place for her alongside Sayers, Allingham, Christie and other \"Golden Age\" dames of cosy Brit-crime. But, despite the odd convincing moment (try real-life Wagner soprano Helen Traubel's ghost-written mystery, the Mickey Spillane-ish The Metropolitan Opera Murders), the world of opera and concerts in detective fiction has still to find a Dick Francis or Patricia Cornwell who can make a true whodunit out of a specialised world. Meanwhile, turn to two convincing makeovers of popular opera plots: James M Cain's Serenade, a translation of Bizet's Carmen into American gangster land, and, especially, Michael Dibdin's Cosi fan tutti. With his series detective Aurelio Zen as an unwitting (but accidentally triumphant) Don Alfonso, Dibdin, his chapter headings wittily drawn from da Ponte's stage directions and libretto, lets Mozart's opera of love and role-play loose in 1990's Naples, sending the girls away instead of the boys, recreating key moments like the lovers' supposed suicide in modern terms and spicing up the sexuality nicely. Best of all is that, even if you don't know Mozart's opera from Adam, this is still a first-rate thriller.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Woman in White is at the Palace Theatre, London W1.

  "<p> If chilling out won Ryder Cups, Bernhard Langer's European team would be already on the plane home, the finely wrought golden trophy occupying its own seat. Under the gentle guidance of their German captain, the dozen golfers from England, Scotland, Ireland, Spain and France are approaching today's opening four-ball matches in a mood that can only be described as serene. </p> <p>Yesterday, for the third day in a row, the 35,000 golf fans and corporate guests lining the rolling Oakland Hills course looked on in amazement as the Europeans smiled and joked their way from tee to green. </p> <p> \"Here come the Cee-gar Guys,\" an American spectator said as Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez strolled down the fourth fairway during their final practice round at this country club in a Detroit suburb, puffing contentedly on Havanas the size of Cadillac exhaust pipes. Close behind them came Colin Montgomerie and Padraig Harrington, exchanging banter. </p> <p> Where were the twitches and grimaces and thousand-yard stares that are supposed to accompany the preparations for a competition that has become one of the most bitterly contested rivalries in world sport? As Langer cast his spell of quiet confidence throughout the team this week, it was hard to tell his five Ryder Cup debutants from his veterans of previous battles. </p> <p> For signs of tension you had to turn to the home team, whose preparations have been rather less sure-footed as their captain, Hal Sutton, attempts to regain the trophy yielded up on a tumultuous afternoon at The Belfry two years ago. </p> <p> On that occasion the US effort appeared to be affected by the players' attempt to repair the image so badly damaged by the berserk charge of Ben Crenshaw's squad on to the 17th green at Brookline in 1999. Under Curtis Strange, Crenshaw's successor, they were calm, they were polite, they were gentlemen. And they lost. </p> <p>Sutton, this year's captain, is a Brookline veteran. \"The Horse\", as Crenshaw described him, was among the players who sat and listened with moistening eyes on the Saturday night while George W Bush, then still 18 months away from the presidency, read out a letter written by a Texan soldier during the defence of the Alamo. The next day they went out and slaughtered Europe in the decisive singles matches. </p> <p>What Sutton knows is that giving his players a Rolex watch apiece and surrounding them with a comfortable ambience has absolutely nothing to do with success in the Ryder Cup. Nor is it about winning the beauty contest of the parade of wives and girlfriends at last night's opening ceremony, although Sutton did say that their general contribution to the team effort could be worth \"half a point\". </p> <p> It is about a sense of collective identity forged in extreme circumstances, as featured in a thousand Hollywood war movies. In this case, it is about nudging a bunch of self-centred millionaires towards the realisation that a weekend without a big cheque at the end of it can still have some sort of meaning.</p> <p> Not surprisingly, then, something of the bellicosity that fuelled earlier contests has filtered back into the US approach. \"Like going ashore with the Marines\" was how Jackie Burke Jr, Sutton's 81-year-old vice captain, recently described the desired mindset. The raising of the flags at last night's opening ceremony was supervised by the commanding officer of the Theodore Roosevelt, a US Navy aircraft carrier also known as The Big Stick. </p> <p>But professional golfers are not soldiers, and it remains to be seen whether the occasional indulgence will pay off. When Phil Mickelson asked to be excused practice on Wednesday, saying that it was his habit to take that day off before a major, Sutton reasoned that if Mickelson was prepared to take the Ryder Cup as seriously as a major, then he was not going to stand in his way. Over in the European team room, however, where not one member of the team has a major to his name, eyebrows were raised. </p> <p>\"I think we're going to get the job done this week,\" Sutton said as he stood on the red carpet outside Detroit's Fox Theatre before Thursday night's black-tie gala, at which the teams and their consorts were presented and most of the US players were revealed to be married to blonde women called Amy. His understatement carried an echo of Crenshaw's famous remark at Brookline, as the US faced the final day with a fourpoint deficit. \"I have a good feeling about this,\" he said, to widespread disbelief. </p> <p>Not that the 35th edition of Samuel Ryder's competition is the first thing on the minds of Detroit's sports fans this morning, who are more concerned with the news that an industrial dispute may force the cancellation of the ice hockey season, thus depriving them of the chance to cheer on their beloved Red Wings. Harrington's arrival seemed chiefly significant for his familial relationship - real, albeit distant - to Joey of that ilk, the brilliant young quarterback of the Lions, Detroit's NFL contenders. </p> <p> But to a city pockmarked by abandoned factories and scarred by decades of chilling crime statistics, where virtually all that is left of the once almighty automobile industry and the world-beating Motown record label is a bunch of relics gathered together in museums all over town, the Ryder Cup represents a symbol of renewal, something to set against yesterday's front-page story about the 17-year-old boy and his 13-year-old accomplice charged with the fatal shooting of a 72-year-old deacon after a church barbecue on Tuesday. </p> <p> Not that such concerns are allowed to darken the mood in this corner of the affluent outer suburbs. This week Oakland Hills has become corporate city. Rows of temporary chalets bear the names of merchant banks. Cadillac courtesy limousines slide in and out of the clubhouse car park. The introduction to last night's opening ceremony was performed by Donald Trump, a self-made and re-made zillionaire most recently reincarnated as the star of his own networked reality TV show. </p> <p>The legacy of Brookline is evident in the ban on taking alcohol on to the course. But plenty of drinking will still be done in the hospitality areas and on an adjacent course, where the organisers have built something that they claim to be, at 70,000 sq ft, the largest sports bar in the world. </p> <p> By Sunday night, one set of players will be drowning their sorrows while the others drown in champagne. And we shall know whether the Big Stick and the blondes called Amy can be beaten by a sense of proportion and a good Cuban cigar.</p>",
  "<p>At last, the much-maligned ICC Champions Trophy sprang to life here yesterday evening. But not in the way the organisers would have hoped, as a few dozen yellow-jacketed Surrey stewards struggled to contain about the same number of London's antipodean backpackers, whose enthusiastic alcohol consumption throughout the proceedings had produced an unexplainable desire to reach the square. </p> <p>The chaos, which lasted 20 minutes, was no-holds-barred stuff, with high tackles, headlocks and knees in the back. </p> <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board, which is in charge of security for the tournament, will be keen to prevent any possibility of a repeat at Edgbaston on Sunday when India play Pakistan. \"This is not something we should get out of context, because it happened after the game,\" said the ECB spokesman David Clarke. \"However, what it shows is that legislation would be helpful to deal properly with these people.\" </p> <p>Attempts to introduce statutory punishment, after the potentially dangerous pitch invasions during the 1999 World Cup, have so far been frustrated, and no figures were available last night on how many - if any - of these pitch invaders had been arrested. </p> <p>Interviews being conducted in front of the pavilion were drowned out by the cheers for any pitch invaders who hinted at success - including, most surprisingly, a fat bespectacled man from the pavilion itself - or jeers when the stewards made a tackle. Any who did so within throwing range of the crowd were showered with lager as most of the near-20,000 attendance stayed on for the post-match entertainment. </p> <p>\"It certainly didn't look good,\" agreed New Zealand's captain Stephen Fleming. \"And there's going to be some bruised bodies from the look of it. But at least it wasn't during the game.\" </p> <p>\"I'm not sure how it all started; probably too many beers in the sun,\" said Australia's Ricky Ponting. \"But the security so far has been very good.\"</p>",
  "<p> Courting controversy, Gloucestershire declared yesterday with eight wickets down, denying Lancashire a third bowling bonus point in this battle of the two sides trying to avoid the final relegation spot. </p> <p>When Martyn Ball was bowled by Glen Chapple, the visitors' captain Chris Taylor called his men in. It can only have been done to deny Lancashire that final bonus point and it is inconceivable that at any other time in the season Gloucestershire would have declared at this juncture on the first day. </p> <p>With the wicketkeeper Steve Adshead going well, having completed his fourth half-century of the season, there was no reason why they could not have pushed on to 350 and a fourth batting bonus point. Gloucestershire now require three points to ensure First Division cricket next season. </p> <p>There had been talk before the game about something like this occurring, prompting the appointment of Phil Sharpe, the former Yorkshire, Derbyshire and England batsman, as a rare match referee for a championship match. </p> <p>The ECB's Playing Regulations state: \"An extraordinary declaration for the purposes of this rule is a declaration aimed primarily at denying the bowling side the opportunity to acquire further bonus points in that innings, but without enhancing the batting side's prospects of winning or saving the match. Such a declaration may, depending on the particular circumstances, be deemed as bringing the game into disrepute, penalties for which may include the deduction of points from the offending team.\" </p> <p>Sharpe, doubling up as a pitch liaison officer, surprisingly felt that the declaration was \"perfectly in order\" and that \"Gloucestershire were well within their rights\". He also said that Taylor had spoken to him when contemplating his decision and he in turn had spoken to Alan Fordham, the ECB's cricket operations manager, who had also given his blessing. </p> <p>Lancashire's cricket manager Mike Watkinson said: \"It shows that they don't want to back themselves, but we would probably have done the same in the circumstances.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately this brouhaha overshadowed a career-best performance from the left-arm spinner Gary Keedy, who took seven for 95 from 42 overs of flight and guile. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly Taylor batted first on winning the toss and the quicker Lancashire bowlers found little in the pitch, Dominic Cork huffing and puffing to little effect and Sajid Mahmood being particularly expensive. </p> <p>As early as 11.15am and the 11th over, Keedy was introduced. He found immediate turn and with the final ball of his third over lured Craig Spearman down the pitch to attempt a hit over the top, having him stumped by Warren Hegg. What followed was an almost lone battle against the Gloucestershire batsmen, Keedy finding little support at the other end as Taylor and Tim Hancock made well-crafted half-centuries. </p> <p>Taylor, who shared a stand of 111 with Mike Hussey, was also stumped and Stuart Law took three smart catches, two at silly point and one at slip, while Keedy will have taken great delight from Alex Gidman's first-ball dismissal, leg-before to an arm ball. </p> <p>Lancashire's reply lasted only one over before bad light ended an eventful day early at 10 to five, with 73 overs of spin bowled in 101.2 overs overall, including a change of innings, and still 70 minutes of play lost.</p>",
  "<p> Kent, striving to hang on to second place, worked their way efficiently through the Middlesex order yesterday. It was a day to remember for the Kent wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien, a permanent choice in the side thanks to the elevation of Geraint Jones. The first six wickets fell to O'Brien catches. </p> <p>After a steady start by Middlesex - fourth in the table and only nine points behind Kent - Sven Koenig flashed outside off in Simon Cusden's first over and Ben Hutton top-edged a hook. </p> <p>The introduction of Matthew Walker's medium-pace wobblers brought O'Brien up to the stumps and Owais Shah obligingly nibbled at a leg-cutter, then Paul Weekes nicked an expansive drive. Ed Joyce pushed defensively at a Ben Trott ball that moved across him and Ben Scott fell the same way to Cusden, completing O'Brien's satisfying sequence. </p> <p>When the brisk Antiguan Rob Joseph returned in late afternoon he concentrated on a testing full length, accounting for Simon Cook, Chris Peploe and Melvyn Betts in nine balls, and the innings closed when Nantie Hayward tried a bizarre reverse sweep at Alex Loudon. </p> <p>One bonus point did little for Middlesex's ambitions. </p> <p>Although David Fulton went early, miscuing a Cook delivery, and Rob Key took an age to stoke up his engine, Kent moved smoothly into a commanding position by the close thanks initially to a 45-ball half-century from Ed Smith. Once Key located the middle of his bat he too picked up the tempo, greeting both spinners Weekes and Peploe with mid-wicket sixes. </p> <p>It may seem odd that the second-placed county should be unsettled but all is not well at Kent, with Smith reportedly looking for a move to Middlesex and an extraordinary general meeting being sought by disgruntled members, who have seen the county demoted in the National League for the first time. </p> <p>One agitator is Mark Ealham's father-in-law, Stewart Stennett. He said: \"I don't want to wreck the club -I just want to ensure it is run efficiently for the supporters and to have harmony in the dressing room.\" The decision to let Ealham move to Trent Bridge is, of course, one reason for the underlying unease.</p>",
  "<p> Graeme Souness may not be renowned as a conciliator but, midway through the second half, Newcastle's new manager strode on to the pitch to help prevent the referee from losing all control of two sets of warring players.</p> <p> As an Israeli Arab team featuring a blend of Muslims and Jews, Sakhnin are regarded as footballing peace ambassadors but, sadly, they spread little harmony on Tyneside. Souness's first match in charge was duly tarnished by far too many snide tackles from the outset but, when Nicky Butt, who had been on the pitch for only two minutes after replacing Kieron Dyer, was sent off for attempting to throttle Abas Suan in retaliation for a tackle which also saw Sakhnin's captain dismissed, red mist descended.</p> <p> Along with Craig Bellamy and Butt, Alan Shearer was left on the bench and, although the No9 is much admired by Souness and certain to return at Southampton on Sunday, such demotion perhaps served as a reminder that it is his new manager's prerogative to rest him every now and then.</p> <p> There will, it seems, be no repeat of the petulance with which Shearer greeted Sir Bobby Robson's decision to leave him on the bench for a Uefa Cup tie in Norway last winter. Even so it would have been fascinating to read the Newcastle captain's mind as he watched Patrick Kluivert register the early goal which ensured the Souness era got off to the best possible start. With Shola Ameobi, nuisance value personified, provoking an almighty goalmouth bundle, Kluivert was left to stroke the ball into the net from five yards at a moment when Energy Murambadoro, Sakhnin's goalkeeper, was still disoriented after blocking a Dyer effort.</p> <p> It all made rather a mockery of Sakhnin's elaborate formation which, in Abed Rabah, featured the most hyper-active of sweepers. Despite his best efforts - and a litany of niggly little fouls from his teammates - only slapdash finishing and pedantic offside flagging denied Kluivert a hattrick inside 15 minutes. Even so the watching Ronny Johnsen, the former Manchester United and Aston Villa defender, who has emerged from retirement to sign a short-term contract which makes him a Newcastle player until January, saw evidence of how he might help out.</p> <p> Indeed, if Shay Given had not reacted smartly to divert an awkward shot from Suan, Sakhnin might well have equalised. Tellingly, Suan's opening was conjured by Agoye Olumide, a Nigerian striker who enjoys a burgeoning reputation in Israel. In the heart of United's rearguard was Robbie Elliott, wearing the captain's armband. Frozen out of the first-team picture by Robson for nearly two years, Elliott has apparently impressed Souness.</p> <p> After briefly losing their touch and tempo, Newcastle's confidence about winning this game came flooding back when Kluivert made a late run from deep to meet a Laurent Robert corner and claim his second goal by squeezing a header under the bar.</p> <p> The only shame was that a crowd of merely 30,221 turned up to see not only Souness's induction but the first Arab team in the Uefa Cup. Those braving the autumnal chill booed Dyer at kick-off, thawed towards him but, when a hamstring pull necessitated his second-half withdrawl, there were cries of \"hope it's nothing trivial\".</p> <p> His replacement Butt had barely touched the ball before he was scythed down by Suan. Reacting furiously Butt raised his fist, appearing to aim a punch at Suan before grabbing him by the throat. Both men were sent off.</p> <p> Presumably anxious not to be overlooked, Lee Bowyer launched into a reckless tackle on Alain Masudi for which he was rightly booked. Enhanced discipline will be demanded in two weeks' time when the return in Tel Aviv may now be trickier than anticipated.</p> <p>Newcastle United (4-4-2): Given; Carr, O'Brien, Elliott, Hughes (Bernard, 15min); Dyer (Butt, 58), Bowyer, Jenas, Robert; Ameobi (Milner, 68), Kluivert.</p> <p>Subs not used: Harper, Shearer, Bellamy, Ambrose.</p> <p>Sent off: Butt.</p> <p>Bnei Sakhnin (5-3-1-1): Murambadoro; Kassom, Danan, Rabah, Etchi, Ghnaim; Hamud (Rodrigues, 54), Suan, Rabah; Masudi; Olumide.</p> <p>Subs not used: Aliaz, Khalaila, Salah, Salameh, Edri, Shalaata.</p> <p>Booked: Suan, Ghnaim, Danan.</p> <p>Sent off: Suan.</p> <p>Referee: A Costa (Portugal).</p>",
  "The declaration of the United Nations secretary-general, Kofi Annan, on the Iraq war was shocking in its simplicity. He described it for the first time as \"illegal\". No caveats. No equivocation. None of the ambiguity loved by diplomats, especially at UN headquarters. The shock is in part because Annan is an inherently cautious individual. He has long professed that his role is basically that of a civil servant carrying out the decisions of the UN security council. But he has finally made his stand, angered by the damage the war has done to Iraq, to the international community and to the UN. He has been building up to these outspoken comments. Only days before the invasion of Iraq in March last year, he hinted at his opposition but without going so far as to declare it illegal, only saying that without a second UN resolution the \"war's legitimacy will be questioned and the support for it will be diminished\". In September, he returned to this theme, saying pre-emptive strikes \"could set precedents for the proliferation of the unilateral and lawless use of force\". He finally left all restraint behind in an interview broadcast by the BBC on Wednesday night in which he concluded: \"From our point of view and from the charter point of view, it was illegal.\" <p>His verdict undercuts the argument pursued relentlessly by George Bush and Tony Blair that the war had UN approval. Blair cites as justification two security council resolutions from the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf war and the one agreed after much tortuous negotiation in 2002, even though it did not warn explicitly of war if Iraq failed to disarm, only of \"serious consequences\". Annan said on Wednesday this was not enough: a second resolution explicitly authorising war was needed. Both the US and British governments have a tendency to treat the run-up to the war as history. This is especially so in Britain where the government argues that the issues have been gone over exhaustively in the Hutton and Butler inquiries. Weary ministers say that whatever the rights and wrongs of going to war, it is time to address the problems facing Iraq now. But the reasons for going to war still matter because the UN matters, and the credibility of the government matters. The Labour party has a long history of passionate support for the ideals of the UN and international law. And the UN charter is perfectly clear in permitting force in only two circumstances: the first in self-defence and the second when the security council authorises action to counter a threat, usually one regarded as imminent. Neither was the case in Iraq. </p> <p>Bush personally and Blair through his Downing Street press officer yesterday continued to insist that the case for war was legal. If Blair is so sure of this, it is time for him to publish the legal advice he received at the time from the attorney general in its entirety so that people can judge for themselves. </p> <p>Blair would like to see the UN take on a bigger role in Iraq but Annan is resistant, partly because of the bombing of the UN headquarters last year and partly, according to one of his advisers, because he does not feel an obligation to sort a mess of someone else's making. The carnage on Iraq's streets shows no sign of lessening, and if the security situation does not improve, there is doubt, as Annan hinted, over the feasibility of holding the country's first democratic election in January as planned. There was a brief hope when the US handed over to the interim Iraq government in June that the worst might be over, but since then there has been the siege of Najaf and this week, which has proved to be one of the bloodiest yet. Civil war and fragmentation of the country remain possible. While Annan's verdict on the war is welcome, the pity is that he did not have the courage to make it last year, before the US and Britain embarked on war.</p>",
  "Civil War! proclaimed the Daily Mail in mile-high headlines. No, this was class war. The young toff yobs who invaded the Commons belong to the princes' party - the three hunting princes who have always backed the Countryside Alliance. Most of the invaders were public schoolboys living in spitting distance of Highgrove, members of the princes' Gloucestershire polo and hunting set that runs on Pimms, guns and Jilly Cooper. <p>This was treason. The royal party and the lords - aided by a bit of feudal muscle from their hunt servants - were usurping the people's democracy. Where was Black Rod, hired to keep the monarch's party out of the Commons? Despite a Labour government committed to ban hunting backed by the public, Prince Charles has made the gesture of taking his young sons out hunting in defiance of the polls. Here were the princes' friends, invading the Commons. The heir to throne has the political tact of his namesake, Charles I. </p> <p>I could fill this column with the extraordinary things printed in the Daily Telegraph yesterday - Boris Johnson, Bill Deedes, Charles Moore at full gallop. How pleasurable was the shock of the ruling classes finding the police not forelock-tugging to them for once: \"I do not have a high opinion of our dear police,\" said a shocked \"respectable country solicitor\", according to Moore out there in the melee where he found \"shaven heads, tattoos and rough tongues\" mixed with marquesses. His reportage described the gallant countryside forces as if they were Henry V's archers and aristocrats at Agincourt. Except they lost the day yesterday: hunting was banned. \"In the crowd's mood one felt the makings of a national tragedy,\" Moore concluded theatrically. </p> <p>What exactly is their tragedy? Since hunting is atavistic and elemental, it's not surprising it brings out primal politics on both sides. What, the Telegraph writers kept asking, turned \"good, law-abiding people\" into rioters assaulting the police? What made them so extraordinarily angry? </p> <p>That's easy. Their rage is a last hurrah for a lost world. This feels to them like the death throes of old England. These are the dispossessed, incoherent with fury at all that they have lost. A way of life is at threat, they keep saying. They mean it and they feel it passionately. The country party believes it is the authentic yeomanry, the embodiment of all English history, symbols of Englishness itself, keepers of the countryside that is the soul of our green and pleasant land. Their anguish comes from blind incomprehension at why and how they lost the power and influence that once was their birthright. </p> <p>Baying outside the barriers, they blow their impotent little hunting horns at an alien Labour government, firmly set to stay indefinitely. Here for the first time is a powerful, legitimate, effective Labour government such as there has never been. All other Labour governments in the last Tory century were accidental squatters, always teetering on the edge of disasters that would soon unseat them from their brief perch. Now the hunters' own old Tory party has withered into a useless rump of sub-Thatcherite suburban \"garagistes\", people whom these countrysiders barely recognise as their own kind. The Telegraph, the journal of countryside grandeeism and its wannabes, turns out to have been a cynical shell, the plaything of a posturing villain accused of the grossest fraud. The countrysiders cannot and will not reconcile themselves to their new place on the far margins of national consciousness in a profoundly urban culture. </p> <p>These landowners have not lost money - far from it - but they can't understand why it no longer buys enough influence. Three-quarters of farmers own their own land - and their land values have more than tripled in the last 10 years. (It's another story for the wretched 30% tenant farmers.) Of the small minority of citizens who live in the country, only 2% have any employment linked with the land. The majority of country-dwellers these days are dormitory denizens, not Countryside Alliance types: that's why polls show rural residents as opposed to hunting as city folk. Yet the country party's expectation is still that wide acres should mean great power. Well-off, well-organised and genuinely outraged, they can field huge demonstrations and persuade themselves that their tiny numbers still wield political clout. </p> <p>What they lack in numbers, they make up for in the depth of their loathing for the New Labour townies. With feudal hauteur they saw nobility in the horny-handed old socialist miners and dockers of yore, but their contempt for the modern managerial middle classes of New Labour knows no bounds. They have never met these types - the ordinarily educated products of the upper echelons of comprehensives, all those teachers, social workers and technocrats they see as interfering do-gooders. This is indeed class war - the last stand of the usurped upper class and their imitators. </p> <p>Sadly, this preposterous waste of political energy will drag on and on, because this time their indignation is justified. Although they rail in vain against their waning power, they have every right to feel aggrieved at this assault on their relatively harmless if distasteful pleasures. So hounds will be publicly massacred, the police will be mocked and the law openly defied. </p> <p>The whole debate is a sign of politically decadent times. The left should wonder why they are unable to summon up a fraction of that anger about the things that really matter. Where is the same fury about social injustice in this most unequal nation in Europe? The left never stormed the Lords to throw out the hereditaries and demand democracy. Instead, it's the hunters, misogynous fathers and fuel protesters of the right who rattle the cage. </p> <p>The countrysiders in the Lords will oppose the hunting bill again, but others will oppose it for good liberal reasons - proving the need for a second chamber. Liberals should always be wary of banning people from doing as they like. There needs to be an overwhelming case for the serious harm done: hunting just doesn't meet that criteria (killing a few foxes is not more cruel than battery farming). Poking rich landowners into class warfare may be satisfying, but it is not a good enough reason to stop them doing something they passionately want to do. </p> <p>The Parliament Act was first used by Lloyd George in 1911 for real class war. He bulldozed through brave new taxes in the most radical budgets to start up the welfare state. He forced through pensions, sick pay and national assistance for the destitute against the strongly armed self-interests of the rich. That should be a sobering reminder for New Labour, which has often elevated cowardice to a political ideology. </p> <p>The Parliament Act now might be used for similar historic acts - for imposing land taxes to capture the vast untaxed wealth of soaring property values or for windfalling the City fat cats' obscene greed.

  "Rail renationalisation is due to be inserted into Labour's draft manifesto despite heavy Downing Street lobbying against a pincer movement by union leaders and constituency activists. <p>Labour is poised to amend a key policy document at its annual conference in Brighton later this month, committing the party to promise an \"integrated, accountable and publicly owned railway\" at the general election. </p> <p>The internal paper, Building Sustainable Communities, has been drawn up as a cornerstone of the manifesto, and Tony Blair would trigger a divisive and very public row if he attempted to simply ignore it. </p> <p>Gerry Doherty, general secretary of the TSSA white-collar transport union, has resisted intense pressure from the Labour high command to withdraw the amendment. </p> <p>Mr Doherty, viewed as on the soft-left rather than a member of the union \"awkward squad\", said there was widespread public support for a publicly owned rail network. </p> <p>\"We're not doing it for dogma, we're not doing it for ideology, we're doing it because it's right,\" said Mr Doherty. </p> <p>If rail renationalisation is inserted into the national policy forum document it will be the first time unions and activists have successfully used the party's procedures to secure a significant manifesto amendment on the floor of the conference. </p> <p>Unless the leadership scores an unlikely win on the issue later this month, Mr Blair would be faced with either adopting the commitment or ditching it at the Cabinet-national executive meeting held when the election is called to finalise the manifesto. </p> <p>The rail renationalisation call was defeated at July's Warwick policy forum, where unions were outgunned but secured sufficient support to be discussed at the conference.</p> <p>Party officials and No 10 also oppose moves to write into the manifesto commitments to lowering the voting age to 16, ending \"sweeteners\" to persuade council tenants to opt out of local authority control, and making peers directly elected to the House of Lords.</p> <p>Though it was official party policy in opposition, Mr Blair has resisted pressure to renationalise the rail industry.</p> <p>A senior minister recently privately conceded the government was wrong not to reverse Tory privatisation in 1997. </p> <p>Subsidies to the train operating companies have risen to above \u00a32bn a year compared with \u00a31.5bn at current prices in 1993-94, the last full year of British Rail, as services have deteriorated. </p> <p>The TSSA argues that commuter and inter city services could be taken back into public ownership as franchises end, rolling stock leasing companies bought out and accountability improved over Network Rail, with the track and station operator effectively run by the government. </p> <p>The Labour leadership faces up to eight contemporary or emergency motions at Brighton. </p> <p>The \"Big Four\" unions are to coalesce around motions on public services, employment rights, pensions and manufacturing based on the 56-point Warwick accord in July. </p> <p>Dave Prentis, Unison general secretary, said: \"We want to make sure that the party adopts a radical manifesto that will appeal to core voters and enthuse Labour activists to go out and campaign.\"</p>",
  "<b> Times</b> <br> Editorial, September 16 <p>\"Security at the House of Commons failed utterly when, for a few dramatic seconds [on Wednesday] afternoon, the Serjeant at Arms and his black-frocked subordinates proved no match for five angry young men in T-shirts. But in the end the demonstrators' invasion of the chamber was an act of physical futility matched only by the political futility of the [anti-hunting] bill whose passage they attempted to disrupt.</p> <p>\"The breach will backfire on the entire movement arrayed against a ban on foxhunting, which hitherto has prided itself on its stolid respectability. In the longer term, however, [Wednesday's] theatrics in and around Parliament Square will reflect worst on a government which has risked social and constitutional strife to mollify its base with an unnecessary law.\" </p> <p><b> Independent</b><br> Editorial, September 16 </p> <p>\"What happened [in the Commons was] a pernicious flash of mob rule and an affront to our democracy. The culprits were summarily ejected; the debate resumed and the vote was taken. The ban on hunting was passed by a big majority. To this extent, the disruption failed. </p> <p>\"That the purpose of the protest was essentially limited to nuisance, however, does not make it innocent. This was the third time in six months that the security of parliament has been breached. First Greenpeace scaled the tower of Big Ben. Then a militant campaigner for fathers' rights dropped purple flour on the prime minister from the almost glassed-in public gallery. Now the hunters. London is supposed to be in a state of heightened vigilance against terrorism. Whatever additional security measures have been taken, they are clearly not working.\" </p> <p><b>Trevor Kavanagh</b><br> Sun, September 16 </p> <p>\"Security around our important public buildings is not just a joke - it is a comic opera. Fathers4Justice and the hunt protesters have done us a favour. They have proved that - even faced with electronic surveillance, ID cards and guards armed with submachine guns at every entrance - determined intruders can infiltrate the very heart of our democracy. There are alarming implications for the security of this nation. The protesters came within yards of the prime minister's office. Had they been carrying explosives, they could have carried out a Beslan-style atrocity.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Express</b><br> Editorial, September 16 </p> <p>\"What if the intruders had been wielding guns instead of angry words? If they had sprayed MPs with bullets, the pictures we would have seen in newspapers and television would have been very different. As we watched those disgraceful scenes most of us would have been shocked to see how vulnerable our representatives are. </p> <p>\"The liberty our wonderful country gives us is to be cherished. People have the right to protest but they must do so peacefully. Our MPs must be free to do their duty without fear or intimidation. The inquiry that will follow this latest outrage will no doubt result in measures which will mean in future we will have a greater distance between our MPs and those they represent. We must act to stop the rot and to guard against terrorists. Measures must be taken that should have been taken a very long time ago.\" </p> <p><b>Stephen Glover</b><br> Daily Mail, September 16 </p> <p>\"There can be no defence of the five people who burst into the chamber. These people did not help their cause. If they had been al-Qaida terrorists, rather than desperate pro-hunting protesters, the damage would have been incalculable. </p> <p>\"Despite the erection of a glass screen in the public gallery, the profusion of concrete blocks surrounding parliament, and many other security measures, it was possible for five men to run into the House of Commons. The degree of incompetence on the part of the authorities is staggering.\" </p> <p><b> Scotsman</b><br> Editorial, September 16 </p> <p>\"It is time to stop entrusting the life of political leaders to men in tights. Each crackdown in security meets a familiar protest from a few of the more idle MPs: this would somehow close down British democracy, make it more distant. What they mean is that proper security would impede their way as they stagger from bar to taxi late at night. </p> <p>\"The House of Commons [is] the seat of British democracy and the property not of a few MPs, but of the voters, who expect the highest level of security around it. On September 11 2001, our politicians lost the right to use it as a house away from home.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Telegraph</b><br> Editorial, September 16 </p> <p>\"[Wednesday's] protest in the Commons chamber, and the clashes between police and hunt supporters outside parliament, show that the patience of some of the most law-abiding people in the land cannot be taken for granted in the face of very bad laws.</p> <p>\"We understand, and we share, the rage many feel towards the government in this most disgraceful political manoeuvring, but it is essential that what is dismissively called 'the hunting lobby' not provide opponents with ammunition by a concerted campaign of disruption. Hunting will not be saved by men dressing up in Batman suits.</p>",
  "Hunt supporters are planning a fresh wave of protests at Labour's annual conference in 10 days' time, with the likelihood of thousands taking to the streets of Brighton and the prospect of militant elements breaking ranks to carry out more direct action over the coming days. <p>Buoyed by their success in infiltrating Westminster, bringing part of central London to a standstill and badly disrupting the M25 with a rolling roadblock on Wednesday, some activists are considering more aggressive tactics.</p> <p>With bitter memories of the disruption caused by fuel protests four years ago, when pickets were allowed to blockade some refineries and distribution depots with apparent impunity, police have agreed with the Home Office to adopt a more active approach. </p> <p>The Countryside Alliance, according to its more moderate elements, is now at a crossroads, sending out mixed messages and unable to keep the lid on more disruptive protests. </p> <p>In a remarkable reversal of roles, animal welfare organisations, which have frequently been accused of provoking violence by disrupting hunts, yesterday accused country sports enthusiasts of taking their protests to militant extremes and threatening democracy. </p> <p>\"The hunters must now accept the will of parliament, abide by the law of the land and stop demonstrating an intolerable contempt for democracy,\" said Douglas Batchelor, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports. </p> <p>Phyllis Campbell-McRae, UK director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, added: \"Our hunt monitors have braved threats and abuse on a daily basis... hunters must now heed the will of parliament and the British electorate.\" </p> <p>Forced onto the defensive, the alliance's chairman, John Jackson, had earlier rushed out a statement clarifying his organisation's position after the invasion of the Commons. \"I condemn these lawless activities, which are selfish and self-indulgent,\" he said. </p> <p>However, while labelling the scenes \"unfortunate and unnecessary\", Simon Hart, chief executive of the alliance, said: \"But when the Labour party is destroying people's lives in some perverted game of political football, they are not surprising.\" </p> <p>The hunting fraternity is divided on how to proceed. While some are openly advocating breaking the law in the event of a ban, others are urging caution. Christopher Hodgson, joint master of the Bicester hunt in Oxfordshire, urged the alliance - of which he is a member - to remain committed to non-violence. </p> <p>But there are fears that splinter groups, with members straddling the alliance and more militant offshoots, may dictate the agenda. The Countryside Action Network, for instance - one of whose leaders, Janet George, is a former communications chief at the alliance - has warned that it is planning surprise protests. </p> <p>\"We are not law-breakers, although we bend a few,\" she joked. </p> <p>Another former official of the Farmers for Action group, which has blockaded creameries and supermarket distribution depots in protest at low prices paid to producers, said road blockades were high on the agenda. </p> <p>\"They will get a shock over what will happen,\" said Richard Haddock, who farms in Devon. \"I have never known such frustration in the countryside.\" </p> <p>An attempt to topple an electricity pylon in north Cumbria this week underlined the determination of militant rural groups to take their campaign beyond street protests. Police called the action reckless, and engineers said the saboteurs had put their lives in \"extreme danger\". </p> <p>A day later, a rolling roadblock on the M25 led to at least one angry confrontation and caused extensive disruption - providing a foretaste, some fear, of demonstrations to come. </p> <p>Protests began outside Tony Blair's constituency home in Trimdon, Country Durham, at the weekend and spread to Chequers the following day, disrupting Cherie Blair's 50th birthday celebrations with another series of roadblocks.</p>"
