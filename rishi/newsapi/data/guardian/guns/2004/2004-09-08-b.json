  "<p>The cricketing summer may have belonged to a Lancastrian but, for the county Andrew Flintoff left behind, it has turned into a nightmare. </p> <p>A spring of high expectation, that the 70-year wait for an outright Red Rose championship would end, has given way to probable relegation and angry recrimination. It was fuelled by last season's second-placed finish, the signing of Dominic Cork and an 11-match unbeaten run in all competitions which left them top of the table at the end of May. Now there are calls for the captain Warren Hegg to resign, after a feeble defeat by Surrey at Old Trafford last weekend left the pre-season favourites cut adrift in the bottom three. </p> <p>Anything other than a convincing victory over Worcestershire in their penultimate game, starting at Worcester today, will send Lancashire down for the first time since the championship split into two divisions in 1999. </p> <p>\"Lancashire in the Second Division? It doesn't sound right,\" admits Jack Simmons, the former off-spinner whose fish-and-chip lunches made him an Old Trafford cult hero in his playing days and who is now the county's chairman. But even Flat Jack, normally so ebullient, must be struggling to see an escape route: it is nine matches and more than three months since Lancashire won a four-day fixture, so the prospects of the consecutive victories they need are not good. </p> <p>Paul Allott, a former Lancashire and England seamer, says he is mystified. \"There has to be something that's gone wrong,\" he said. \"But what it is I've no bloody idea. </p> <p>\"It's a puzzle to most of us, I don't think anybody can put a finger on it or even come up with a credible explanation. Maybe an element of over-confidence crept in with a couple of players who are prone to a bit of a swagger. Maybe the weight of expectation becomes too great, although you can't say that it's 70 years of waiting for the current players - more like three, four or five years for most of them. That bunch of players should not be in the relegation zone, end of story. They need to look at themselves and do a bit of soul-searching.\" </p> <p>So an attempt to explain what has gone wrong must start with the players, specifically the batsmen. </p> <p><strong> 1. Run famine</strong><br> </p> <p> Last year Lancashire's batsmen shared 28 centuries in 16 championship matches, the county's highest tally since 1928, with four players - Stuart Law, Carl Hooper, Mal Loye and Mark Chilton - passing 1,000 runs. This season Loye is the leading scorer with 868, and they are 50% down on centuries. \"They are still class players,\" says the coach Mike Watkinson. \"They're just massively short of confidence.\" </p> <p><strong> 2. Star syndrome</strong><br> </p> <p> Watkinson has wondered aloud what happened to the battling spirit which allowed a transitional Lancashire team to over-achieve in the previous two summers. </p> <p>\"With the media saying we were going to do an Arsenal and go through the season unbeaten, maybe some of the players started believing their own publicity,\" Simmons admits. </p> <p>Peter Martin, an unsung hero in the Lancashire attack for more than a decade, has been restricted by a knee injury to three championship games since the slide began in June, and in one of those, against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham, he was replaced after lunch on the second day when James Anderson was released by England. </p> <p>Cork, whose signing from Derbyshire was supposed to be the last piece in Lancashire's jigsaw, has huffed and puffed with the usual histrionic enthusiasm. But he has not been able to replace Martin as a steady and reliable senior seamer. </p> <p><strong> 3. Injuries</strong><br> </p> <p> As Allott says, losing Flintoff and Anderson to England is not a valid excuse because it was predictable. \"You cer tainly can't blame England calls because Lancashire always knew they weren't going to see much of Flintoff this season,\" he argues. But Lancashire's bad luck with injuries does merit some sympathy. </p> <p>In the Kent defeat at Tunbridge Wells, when their season started to unravel, they were missing Martin and Hooper, another key man, who was out for the best part of five weeks with a broken thumb. In their next game Glen Chapple suffered severe bruising to the brain, when he was felled by a James Kirtley bouncer, and Law (back), Loye (achilles) and Hegg (hamstring) have also missed important matches since then. </p> <p><strong> 4. Captaincy</strong><br> </p> <p> Hegg is the most obvious scapegoat and a section of the Lancashire membership has been critical of his captaincy. He would not claim to be a tactical genius, and captaining from behind the stumps is onerous. But, as a proud Lancastrian who has given excellent service for 18 summers, Hegg deserves sympathy not abuse; his dream of becoming the first captain since Peter Eckersley in 1934 to lead Lancashire to the championship disappeared while he was out with that hamstring problem. </p> <p><strong> 5. Chain of command</strong><br> </p> <p> Watkinson's impressive work in his previous two years as cricket manager - which earned him promotion to Duncan Fletcher's England staff last winter and for this - has given him sufficient credit to prevent any serious calls for his head, although he too has come in for recent abuse from the more volatile members in Old Trafford's so-called Pit of Hate. </p> <p>But Simmons will be expecting a rough ride at this winter's annual general meeting - especially with his predecessor Bob Bennett now back on the committee and offering a potential alternative for a disgruntled membership. </p> <p>Questions must also be asked about the lack of home-grown players, particularly batsmen. Watkinson has had to sign Law from Essex, Loye from Northamptonshire and Iain Sutcliffe from Leicestershire, in addition to stumbling on Hooper last summer to fill the gaping holes left by the unexpected departures of Jason Gallian to Nottinghamshire and John Crawley to Hampshire, and now another Australian, Brad Hodge, has been targeted for next year. </p> <p>Watkinson, since his appointment, has accelerated the development of an academy but that will inevitably take time to bear fruit. It should have been set up years earlier. </p> <p><strong> 6. Old Trafford</strong><br> </p> <p> Lancashire's on-field crisis could not have come at a worse time, with uncertainty about Old Trafford's future as a Test venue and possibly even as the county's headquarters following an attempt by Manchester City Council to attract the club to a purpose-built arena adjacent to the City of Manchester Stadium. However, the prospects of moving now seem increasingly remote, mainly because they make so much money when the car parks are used for nearby Manchester United.</p>",
  "<p>An epic, a classic, it was a night Northern Ireland will never forget and one that Wales will not want to remember. </p> <p>Reduced to nine men for 69 minutes plus the four and more added on at the end by a most dubious Italian referee, Northern Ireland produced one of their greatest performances for years not only to thwart Wales but to restore pride battered by the 3-0 home defeat by Poland last Saturday. </p> <p>This was heroic endeavour and that the Irish could go from one end of the spectrum to the other in terms of quality was only one of the features of a remarkable evening. </p> <p>Lawrie Sanchez's team arrived in Cardiff as 7-1 outsiders but were two up by the 21st minute. Sadly for them they were also two down in terms of personnel by then. </p> <p>David Healy had scored the visitors' second but he subsequently became the second Irishman to be sent off by the referee Domenico Messina. Twelve minutes earlier Messina had dismissed Michael Hughes and shown Robbie Savage the Welsh midfielder's first-ever red card. </p> <p>Hughes had cut Savage down with a two-footed tackle and Savage retaliated. Both had to go and Savage will endure the repercussions - he will miss the England game at Old Trafford next month. </p> <p>Michael Hughes will miss the trip to Azerbaijan but the Irish Football Association will check with Uefa today about Healy's sending-off. Once Healy had rounded Paul Jones to nod in Northern Ireland's second goal he ran to the corner flag and kicked it out. He was in front of exclusively Welsh fans and Messina obviously thought the celebration excessive. </p> <p>A yellow card was shown and then Messina brought out the red after Healy made a gesture to the crowd that the Italian construed as abusive. Once that was shown Healy was staggered. But he had to stagger off and Northern Ireland had to dig in. </p> <p>This they did magnificently. Wales had a man advantage but in the hour and more that followed it rarely showed. </p> <p>Part of that was due to Wales's own mediocrity. Only Craig Bellamy threatened the Irish consistently and dangerously. But the greater part was down to the nine Northern Irish players, each of whom was relentless in his determination. </p> <p>Tony Capaldi, who plays for Plymouth Argyle, was possibly the pick of them. The full-back played in about three positions on the left flank and forced Jones into more saves than any other of the visitors. </p> <p>Capaldi had created the night's first chance with a corner that James Quinn headed narrowly wide after five minutes. </p> <p>The Irish had begun brightly and Jones was soon busy - handling the ball outside his area. Jones was not even booked for this and that indirectly led to the Hughes and Savage m\u00eal\u00e9e because Messina had clearly lost control of a drop-ball situation. </p> <p>Just as the stadium buzzed with those two red cards Jeff Whitley stepped up to jink and drill in a shot from 18 yards. Whitley's shooting against the Poles had been woeful, so this was a shock. </p> <p>Wales were stunned. This was meant to be a home banker and not long after they were two behind. Healy was a more predictable scorer, profiting from James Collins' slip to lob Jones and then head in. </p> <p>But his dismissal gave the Welsh heart as well as numerical superiority. Mark Hughes withdrew Mark Delaney for Robert Earnshaw almost immediately and Wales set about a siege. </p> <p>When John Hartson rose to head in a Bellamy cross just past the half-hour it seemed as though Wales were at last back on track. </p> <p>But their passing was poor thereafter and players like Jason Koumas did not reveal their guile. </p> <p>For Northern Ireland's resilient defence there were too many easy high balls to clear and it was the enterprising Capaldi who looked a more likely scorer than anyone. But then John Oster swung in a centre from the right that Earnshaw met with an emphatic header. </p> <p>There were 16 minutes left and Wales sensed a winner but there was to be only one more opportunity carved out when, with two minutes to go, Bellamy burst into the area and sent a shot across the six-yard box. </p> <p>Collins was on the end of it but stumbled and missed. It was painful for Wales but justice for the Irish. </p> <p>Wales had not deserved to win but Northern Ireland certainly did not deserve to lose. </p> <p> <strong> Wales</strong> (4-4-2): <strong> Jones</strong> (Wolves); <strong> Delaney</strong> (Aston Villa; <strong> Earnshaw,</strong> West Bromwich, 28), <strong> Collins</strong> (Cardiff), <strong> Gabbidon</strong> (Cardiff), <strong> Thatcher</strong> (Man City; <strong> Parry</strong> , Cardiff, 63); <strong> Oster</strong> (Sunderland), <strong> Savage</strong> (Birmingham), <strong> Speed</strong> (Bolton), <strong> Koumas</strong> (West Bromwich); <strong> Bellamy</strong> (Newcastle), <strong> Hartson</strong> (Celtic). </p> <p><strong> Booked:</strong> Hartson. </p> <p><strong> Sent off:</strong> Savage. </p> <p><strong> Northern Ireland</strong> (5-3-2): <strong> Taylor</strong> (Birmingham); <strong> Clyde</strong> (Wolves), <strong> Williams</strong> (MK Dons), <strong> A Hughes</strong> (Newcastle), <strong> Murdock</strong> (Hibs), <strong> Capaldi</strong> (Plymouth); <strong> Johnson</strong> (Birmingham), <strong> Whitley</strong> (Sunderland), <strong> M Hughes</strong> (Crystal Palace); <strong> Quinn</strong> (Willem II, <strong> Smith</strong> , Preston, 58), <strong> Healy</strong> (Preston). </p> <p><strong> Booked:</strong> Taylor, Capaldi. </p> <p><strong> Sent off:</strong> M Hughes, Healy. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> D Messina (Italy).</p>",
  "It was at the time of the passing of the Children Act in 1989 that David Hershman, then a 30-year-old junior barrister in chambers at Two Fountain Court, Birmingham, suggested to me, a colleague in the same chambers, that we might write a textbook on child law to complement the implementation in 1991 of the new act. The only substantial text at that time had originated in 1933. <p>With awesome naivety and no previous typing skill, we typed the text into Amstrad word processors. The book took two years to complete, and it was mostly achieved late at night or early in the morning, so that the court commitments of a busy junior practice at the bar could be met. </p> <p>Children Law And Practice (Family Law) - known as \"Hershman and McFarlane\" - was published on the day that the 1989 Act came into force. It was soon to be seen in lawyers' offices and on judges' benches up and down the country. </p> <p>Its success was an achievement in which Hershman, who has died following a heart attack aged 45, rightly took great pleasure and pride. He had brought to the project a conviction and energy that was to be the hallmark of all he did. Hershman was one of the leading family law advocates of his generation. </p> <p>His status as legal author also led Hershman to another role as a lecturer. His ready gift for explaining complex or dry legal concepts, which had been so well displayed in the book, now found a new outlet. He eschewed the view that a legal lecture had to be serious and was of necessity boring. His lecturing style involved more than a dash of humour and was very much a conversation with his audience. </p> <p>Hershman was educated at King's School, Worcester and at King's College London. In his youth he was a keen sportsman who competed as a shot-putter at national level. He was called to the bar of Gray's Inn in 1981. </p> <p>His writing and lecturing always took a subordinate place to his practice at the bar. A large physical presence, with obvious intellect and well-honed forensic skills, he was universally respected. </p> <p>He had an astounding capacity for work and his habitual forum of practice became the high court and above, undertaking the most challenging of cases. A familiar sight in the courts in Birmingham and the Midland circuit, Hershman progressively widened the geographical range of his practice, particularly after his appointment as a QC in 2002. </p> <p>Hershman would have succeeded in any field of law. That he chose to practise in the less well-remunerated area of children's law resulted from his deeply held belief in the importance of delivering the best result for the individual children. </p> <p>At the time of his death, Hershman had been appointed to be a recorder, a deputy high court judge and a part-time chair of the Care Standards Tribunal. He practised in Birmingham, latterly in St Philip's Chambers, before moving, earlier this year, to join the specialist family law set of One King's Bench Walk in London. </p> <p>During his time in Birmingham, Hershman headed the 30-strong family team in chambers, organised highly successful annual multidisciplinary training days, and was very actively involved in supporting the local Acorns Children's Hospice. </p> <p>Hershman's chief priority in life, however, was not his work. It was his wife, Abi, and their four young daughters. He was devoted to them and his work would always be fitted around them. He was a gregarious, dynamic man, a gentle compassionate giant with a great sense of fun and a very large number of friends. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Allan Hershman, barrister, legal author and lecturer, born November 6 1958; died September 4 2004</p>",
  "<p>Developing countries were last night celebrating victory over the world's two largest economic blocs after the World Trade Organisation ruled against the European Union's sugar regime and the support given by the United States to its cotton farmers. </p> <p>The WTO upheld legal actions spearheaded by Brazil, putting pressure on Brussels and Washington to scale back the billions of euros and dollars spent annually on protecting their agricultural sectors. </p> <p>Endorsing an interim judgement last month, the body that polices world trade found that the EU is exporting much more sugar than it agreed to and that the sugar is unfairly subsidised, encouraging overproduction and damaging producers in poor countries. The case was brought by Brazil, Australia and Thailand. </p> <p>In a separate case, the US was ordered to withdraw some of its support programmes for producers of cotton and other commodities, after a WTO panel ruled Washington was guilty of illegal export subsidies or domestic payments higher than permitted by WTO rules. </p> <p>Brazil said it was pleased by the ruling and hoped the US would obey the decision. Washington said it would appeal against part of the WTO finding while Brussels also expressed its unhappiness with the decision made in Geneva. </p> <p>European commission spokesman Gregor Kreuzhuber issued a terse statement indicating the EU's disappointment. \"A decision on whether to appeal the panel report will be made in due course,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Kreuzhuber noted that the commission last July proposed a \"radical overhaul\" of its sugar regime, intended to cut sugar exports and export refunds, \"abolish intervention, reduce EU production and the internal sugar price\". </p> <p>Oxfam, the development charity, said Brussels had been found to be in the wrong and should stop dumping excess sugar. \"This is about the EU breaking the law by dumping subsidised sugar on world markets,\" said Jo Leadbetter, head of the charity's Brussels office. </p> <p>However, Oxfam's claim that the ruling would not undermine the preferential access the EU grants to other sugar producers, largely former European colonies, was challenged by Tate &amp; Lyle, which said the biggest beneficiary would be Brazil, not the world's poorest nations.</p>",
  "Republicans marched out of their convention intoxicated with the sensation of victory. President Bush, the \"war president\", was the most honest, moral, decisive, and strongest leader in the world. (The unvarying encomiums eerily echoed those of the brainwashed soldiers about the sleeper agent in The Manchurian Candidate: \"Raymond Shaw is the kindest, warmest, bravest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life.\") <p>After Bush's defiant speech - \"Nothing will hold us back!\" - his lead was reported by Time magazine to have climbed to 11 points, which was inhaled like pure oxygen by the Republican cadres. (Both John Kerry's and Bush's internal polls gave Bush only a four-point lead.) </p> <p>Kerry seemed to be reeling in retreat. His disciplined campaign management had suppressed criticism of Bush, supposedly on the basis that swing voters are attracted by vague swirls of optimism. But the effect was that voters remained confused about the contrast between the candidates and Kerry's commitments. Kerry had delayed defending himself against the torpedoes of falsehood fired at his heroic military record by the Orwellianly named Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. </p> <p>Perhaps his gravest self-inflicted wound was replying to Bush's challenge to answer whether he would still have voted for the war resolution on Iraq, knowing what he does today. Kerry said he would and tangled himself in a thicket of sticky nuance. </p> <p>Bush could hardly believe that Kerry had fallen for the gambit. This sucker would buy a bridge in Brooklyn. The triumphant Republicans felt unrestrained in delivering blows to the prone Kerry. Dick Cheney announced that a vote against Bush was tantamount to a vote for a terrorist attack: \"If we make the wrong choice then the danger is that we'll get hit again.\" </p> <p>On the day that former President Clinton had his heart surgery, Cheney attacked him as weak on terrorism, and for good measure set upon Ronald Reagan too. The venerated Reagan had served his purpose as an icon at the convention, but now he was unceremoniously thrown overboard. </p> <p>Only Bush was tough enough. Bush, adopting the tone of the fraternity house president he once was, sarcastically derided Kerry: \"No matter how many times Senator Kerry flip-flops, we were right to make America safer by removing Saddam Hussein from power.\" </p> <p>In fact, on the third day of the Republican convention, Kerry had given a penetrating and highly specific speech on the war on terrorism and Iraq, detailing how Bush's strategy amounted to a series of catastrophic blunders. \"When it comes to Iraq,\" he said, \"it's not that I would have done one thing differently, I would have done almost everything differently.\" </p> <p>Kerry's speech was pointedly ignored by Bush who, with Cheney, rained a steady fire of ridicule down on Kerry. Meanwhile, the report on Iraq by the Royal Institute of International Affairs was buried in the back pages. \"Iraq could splinter into civil war and destabilise the whole region if the interim government, US forces and United Nations fail to hold the ring among factions struggling for power.\" Civil war, the institute said, was \"the most likely outcome\". Kerry remarked that because of Bush's errors \"terrorists have secured havens in Iraq that were not there before\". The New York Times reported that Fallujah and many other cities in the Sunni triangle are under the control of Islamist insurgents. But Bush steadfastly refused to engage Kerry in debate. A report chronicling the undermining of the war against terrorism by James Fallows in The Atlantic, in which numerous military officials described how Afghanistan became a \"sideshow\" as resources were siphoned to Iraq, received almost no attention. \"Our strategy is succeeding,\" Bush told his jubilant rallies. </p> <p>Bush campaigns before the faithful; distressing facts are dismissed with sarcasm and ideology is implacable. Yet at this moment of disdain a discovery that cast light on Bush's character suddenly emerged, having the potential to alter the momentum of the campaign. </p> <p> On Wednesday, the Boston Globe published documents proving that Bush, whose spotty record in the National Guard was always mysterious, \"fell well short of meeting his military obligation\". Maj Gen Paul A Weaver Jr., who retired in 2002 as the Pentagon's director of the Air National Guard, was quoted: \"It appears that no one wanted to hold him accountable.\" </p> <p>That night, CBS's 60 Minutes broadcast the first interview with former Texas lieutenant governor Ben Barnes, who explained how he contrived to get young George his safe posting in the \"champagne unit\" of the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam war. The programme also revealed further documents showing he never fulfilled his service. </p> <p>Abruptly, the Republican marchers stumble as Kerry is galvanised. \"His miscalculation was going to war without planning carefully and without the allies we should have had,\" he said yesterday. Meanwhile in the White House, aides anxiously wonder how to explain the president's haunted past and his long years of hiding it and who will have the task of facing the cameras. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "There were fears yesterday that a controversial conference to commemorate the 9/11 hijackers and other al-Qaida terrorists would provoke rightwing thugs to attack British Muslims. <p>Omar Bakri, leader of the extremist Islamic group al-Muhajiroun, plans to hold the convention this Saturday, the third anniversary of the attack on the twin towers, at an as yet undisclosed location in east London. </p> <p>Anjam Choudry, the UK secretary general of al-Muhajiroun, rejected suggestions that the conference would be a celebration of the 9/11 hijackers, but confirmed it would feature videos of Osama bin Laden and discussions of jihad, as well as a lecture dedicated to dead al-Qaida leaders. </p> <p>However, some supporters of a group called the United British Alliance, which intends to lay a wreath at the US embassy on Saturday to commemorate the victims of 9/11, have threatened to \"stand up to\" those they see as apologists for terrorism. </p> <p>Although the United British Alliance states on its website that it is anti-terrorist, not anti-Islamic or racist, informed sources say it has attracted support from rightwing extremists intent on using the anniversary and the al-Muhajiroun conference as an excuse to attack Muslims. </p> <p>One unofficial West Ham football club supporters' website contains a chat forum about the commemoration, calling for \"patriots to stand up and be counted\". </p> <p>Comments on it included \"The Muslims are celebrating in east London on the day and we gotta stop it\" and \"The plan is to lay a wreath, pay our respects to all those who died, then head over to east London to break up their celebration.\" </p> <p>\"It's obvious some hardcore lads will go along, hoping for a punch-up at the very least,\" said a source. </p> <p>A Scotland Yard source said \"these sorts of groups\" were closely monitored by the intelligence services, and the police would deal with any public disorder or law-breaking. </p> <p>Mr Choudry refused to give details of the conference but said al-Muhajiroun was fully justified in airing a different point of view about al-Qaida and Bin Laden from that generally presented in the west. </p> <p>\"We've made it clear it's not about celebrating the deaths of people. We may not have remorse but we do not celebrate these things,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We will be looking at Iraq and Afghanistan, and some of the al-Qaida personalities who have become household names. The media don't want to hear that Osama bin Laden may have a cause, they just want to demonise him.\" </p> <p>He denied that Muslim hostage takers had killed children in Beslan, claiming the Russians were responsible for the slaughter. </p> <p>\"Muslims would never deliberately kill children,\" he said. \"The Russians were the cause of what happened. </p> <p>\"If others hold a minute's silence for the 3,000 who died in 9/11, then there should be a couple of hours for the people of Iraq and Afghanistan. It's total hypocrisy otherwise.\" </p> <p>But Inayat Bunglawala, general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain, accused al-Muhajiroun of contributing to the marginalisation of British Muslims by deliberately provoking public outrage. </p> <p>\"I'm very sceptical about who's going to turn up: I doubt al-Muhajiroun could rally 100 people to this meeting,\" he said. \"But Omar Bakri specialises in enraging the ordinary public in a way that has done the image of Islam so much damage, and encouraged the polarisation of communities in this country. The British National party has no better recruiting sergeant.\" </p> <p>Mr Bakri was quoted in the London-based Arabic daily newspaper Al-Sharq al-Awsat as saying the conference would focus on the \"anniversary of the division of the world into two great camps, the camp of faith and the camp of unbelief\". </p> <p>He said: \"We want the world to remember this operation [9/11], that lifted the head of the [Muslim] nation ... a cry of jihad against unbelief and oppression.\" </p> <p>Mr Bakri, a Syrian father of seven, moved to the UK in 1985 after being deported from Saudi Arabia because of his membership of a banned group. The Home Office has given him leave to remain in the UK for five years but is reviewing his status.</p>",
  "<p>In 1951 at Borehamwood, the engineer Jack Pateman, who has died aged 82, founded Elliott Brothers Aviation Division. From the beginning, he argued for applying computer technology to systems for aircraft. In this way, he became the aviation division's deputy chairman and joint managing director in 1961, as well as managing director of Elliott Flight Automation from 1971 to 1986. </p> <p>Over the years, the projects that he was involved in included automatic flight control systems, for the Jindivik drone, the BaE Lightning interceptor fighter, the Harrier jump jet, the Tornado fighter and bomber, the Eurofighter, and airliners such as the VC-10, BAC 1-11, Concorde, Airbus and the Boeing 777. The latter was the first Boeing aircraft to have \"fly-by-wire\" flight control. Products also included aircraft head-up displays, airborne radar and anti-submarine sonar systems and automatic landing systems. </p> <p>Since the 1960s, the aviation industry has been notable for regrouping and mergers. Elliott's merged with English Electric - which included Marconi - in 1967 and then Arnold Weinstock's General Electric Company took over English Electric in 1968. The business was large and diverse and the risks were high. However, during these upheavals, Pateman displayed a genius for ensuring his company's survival. </p> <p>Born in Norfolk, he was educated at Great Yarmouth grammar school, During wartime Royal Air Force service, he showed a flair for radar engineering and then in 1948, he joined Elliott Brothers. This was part of Elliott Automation, which under Leon Bagrit, was to be a pioneer of automation in British industry. </p> <p>Under Pateman's leadership, his company won six Queen's Awards for technological achievement and eight for export, principally in the US market. At this peak of performance, his company employed 16,000 people worldwide. Since Pateman's retirement, the avionics organisation has become part of BAE Systems Ltd. </p> <p>He was appointed to 10 different directorships, including those of Canadian Marconi (1971-1987), GEC-Marconi Ltd (1979-1989), GEC Marconi (China) Ltd (1979-1989), and GEC itself (1986-1988). He hated flam boyance, but in 1970 his achievements were recognised when he was made a CBE. In 1981, he was awarded the Royal Aeronautical Society's Gold Medal and elected fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. Post-retirement he became chairman of the Kent County Engineering Society and a director of the Kent Training and Enterprise Council. </p> <p>His Golden Hind sloop, Oenanthe, regularly cruised in France, Holland and the East coast of England and was an annual visitor to the river Blackwater, to support dinghy racing between the Rochester team and the Marconi Sailing Club, of which he was a longtime president. </p> <p>Pateman leaves behind a devoted family, and people, worldwide, who remember him with love and respect. He married Cicely Hope in 1949 and also leaves a daughter Susan, son John, and two grandchildren. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jack Edward Pateman, engineer, born November 29 1921; died August 28 2004</p>",
  "Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has defended plans for a law that seeks to make adultery illegal. The leader of the Justice and Development party insists that his country is not bound to follow \"imperfect\" European standards despite its long-standing ambition to join the EU. With just weeks left before the European commission issues its final assessment on Turkey's progress - prior to a landmark decision by governments in December - the timing could hardly be worse. Mr Erdogan, a moderate and reformist Islamist, has been rightly praised for improving the status of the Kurds, cracking down on torture and strengthening the judiciary. He has also been helpful over Cyprus and challenged the traditionally powerful military establishment. <p>In recent months it has quietly become accepted that Ankara will finally get the green light to start EU membership talks in December. The French and German governments have overcome their reservations, though popular opposition remains strong in both countries, as it does in Austria and the Netherlands. Brussels insists however that nothing should be taken for granted: thus the call yesterday from one commissioner for more progress on Kurdish broadcasting alongside a warning from another about an overstretched union bordering on Iraq. </p> <p>Opponents of Turkish membership imply that they want to keep the EU a \"Christian club\". The EU, of course, is no such thing, and membership depends on political and economic criteria, not religious or ethnic identity. Eighty years after Ataturk, Turkey is a secular democracy with a majority Muslim population - and one to be encouraged in a post-September 11 world in which the feared \"clash of civilisations\" often looks like a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is true that EU laws do not touch on personal morality (abortion is still illegal in Ireland and Portugal). But progressive-minded Turks are right to argue that making adultery the business of the state, as it is in Saudi Arabia, is the wrong message from a country that is now well on the way to realising its European vocation.</p>",

The engine restarts once the accelerator is depressed. </p> <p>PSA says CO2 emissions, which the company describes as \"the greatest threat to the environment\", are cut by similar levels to fuel consumption and that noise levels are also reduced. The first model to be fitted with the system will be the Citro\u00ebn C3. Other models will be equipped with the system at a later date. Stop &amp; Start will be available in the UK next year. </p> <p>Jean-Martin Folz, PSA chief executive, said: \"Judging by some of the traffic conditions in some British cities, I would say there are going to be interesting savings in fuel costs.\"</p>",
  "Jiang Zemin, the conservative chief of the People's Liberation Army, may announce his resignation within weeks, raising hopes for democratic reform in China and an easing of tensions over Taiwan and Hong Kong. <p>Senior Chinese academics said Jiang - a former president seen as the main obstacle to political change - could step down as chairman of the central military commission at a meeting of communist leaders this month. </p> <p>Speculation has reached fever pitch this summer that the most influential Chinese politician of the past 15 years is ready to cede his last position of authority to his successor as president, Hu Jintao. </p> <p>For months foreign China watchers have talked of a growing power struggle in Beijing between Hu - the head of the government - and Jiang, the head of the military. </p> <p>Citing two sources close to the leadership, the New York Times yesterday reported that Mr Jiang told a meeting of senior officials last week that he plans to relinquish his authority. </p> <p>\"It is quite possible that Jiang may retire,\" said Cao Siyuan, president of Beijing Siyuan Research Centre for Social Science. </p> <p>Although public criticism of the leadership has long been curtailed, pro-reform academics in Beijing have become increasingly bold in targeting Mr Jiang and his Shanghai allies, who are blamed for blocking moves to ease restrictions on the media and debate on democratic reform. </p> <p>As the fiercest advocate of the free market, the Jiang camp is also widely associated with rampant corruption, widening social inequality and economic overheating. Through his control of the military Mr Jiang is also held responsible for the mainland's hardline approach to Taiwan and Hong Kong, which runs contrary to Mr Hu's softer diplomatic policy of a \"gentle rise\" of China. </p> <p>In recent weeks influential Communist party publications such as the People's Daily and the Study Times have focused on the ideas of \"balanced development\" and \"people first politics\" most closely associated with Mr Hu and his prime minister, Wen Jiabao. </p> <p>Several senior academics say that Mr Jiang would be taking a risk if he held on to his post as military chief longer than the two years his predecessor, Deng Xiaoping, stayed in the job after relinquishing his other party posts. </p> <p>\"If Jiang steps down this month, it would be normal,\" said Huang Weiping, the director of the political research centre of Shenzhen University. </p> <p>However, Li Anming, the deputy director of the research centre of the Communist Party School, said: \"I don't expect a change of leadership positions at the coming plenum.\"</p>",
  "Forecasts of John Kerry's political demise may have been exaggerated in recent days, and he could still be clinging to a narrow lead in the US presidential race, according to a poll published yesterday. <p>The poll, by Zogby International, reflected the state of play in 20 swing states, and found that the surge in George Bush's support there after last week's Republican convention, was less pronounced than the double-digits suggested in two weekend polls. </p> <p>Those surveys, in Time and Newsweek, triggered alarm and finger-pointing in the Democratic camp, and a reshuffle in the Kerry team. But other surveys have since suggested the Bush convention \"bounce\" was much smaller and the contest remains a close one. </p> <p>The Zogby poll says the president has made up ground in many of the 20 battleground states, but Mr Kerry retains a slim lead in most of them - enough to give him a majority in the electoral college, if the vote was held now. </p> <p>The college, which chooses the president, is made up of 538 delegates drawn from the 50 states and Washington DC, according to population. Assigning electors according to the way each state is leaning now, the Zogby poll gives Mr Kerry a lead of 273 to 222, down from the past two months, but a significant edge all the same. </p> <p>\"There's no doubt that Bush got a bounce ... but no way is he up 11 points,\" John Zogby, the head of Zogby International, said yesterday. </p> <p>Newsweek showed the Mr Bush with an 11 percentage point lead among registered voters, while Time gave him a nine-point lead. But another survey by Gallup, CNN and USA Today showed only a one-point advantage. </p> <p>The confusion may reflect the volatility that follows the impassioned speeches and allegations made at conventions. It may also be explained by different surveying methods, and some of it is simply a result of polls being taken over the Labour Day holiday weekend, when many Americans are away from home. </p> <p>Charlie Cook, an experienced US election analyst, said: \"To be dependent upon getting a representative sample over a holiday weekend is enough to make any pollster wince. Polling conducted this week, after people are back from Labour Day and had a chance to digest the Republican convention, will be a far better test.\" </p> <p>US electoral history suggests that leads established at party conventions can often dissipate in the last two frenetic months of the campaign. Al Gore had a double-digit lead over Mr Bush after the Labour day weekend in 2000, but lost it after lacklustre performances in the three presidential debates. </p> <p>Mr Bush, who had not previously shown much aptitude for public speaking, surprised many doubters by avoiding serious mistakes and scoring a few points in the debates. Mr Kerry must hope to do better than his Democratic predecessor in knocking his opponent off balance. </p> <p>The Zogby results suggest the president's emphasis on his role as a wartime leader at the New York convention helped him reassert control in traditionally conservative southern states where Mr Kerry had been making headway before August, such as North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. But elsewhere the Democratic contender is holding on, and in some states - Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington - has even strengthened his position since the attacks made on his fitness to be America's commander-in-chief. </p> <p>Matthew Dowd and Doug Sosnik, top strategists in the Bush and Kerry camps respectively, both predict that as the race nears the November 2 finishing line, money and manpower will increasingly focus on three large swing states, Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, which have a combined total of 68 electoral college votes. </p> <p>Both candidates have been spending more and more time campaigning there. Mr Bush is due to inspect storm damage in Florida today before heading to Pennsylvania. Mr Kerry will be in Cincinnati, Ohio. </p> <p>Both Mr Dowd and Mr Sosnik forecast that whoever wins two of the three big battlegrounds will probably be the next president. </p> <p>At present, according to Zogby, Mr Bush is ahead in Ohio by 11 points. Mr Kerry has a smaller edge of three points in Pennsylvania. Florida is a dead heat, as it has been for much of the year. By that reckoning, this election could be fought and won once more in the Sunshine State, currently being pummelled by hurricanes, just as it was four years ago.</p>",
  "Cruising into the Johannesburg River club for a round of golf, lifting off in helicopters for weekend retreats, sipping champagne at black-tie functions: they are South Africa's new randlords. <p>They spend long hours in towers of steel and glass running financial empires, but it is when they come out to play that the public get a glimpse of South Africa's first black rand billionaires, men who have zoomed from modest means to mega-wealth in a few years. </p> <p>They are saluted by some as models of what is possible in the post-apartheid era; condemned by others as the embodiment of crony capitalism, which enriches a few and leaves many in poverty. </p> <p>In the debate on whether they should be encouraged or reined in, the latter seem to be winning. The government is cooling its enthusiasm for what one minister recently called with irony the \"gentlemen of empowerment\". </p> <p>In 2003 the African National Congress introduced black economic empowerment (BEE) legislation, designed to transfer chunks of the economy to those \"previously disadvantaged\" by white minority rule. </p> <p>A decade after apartheid white people, who make up 10% of the population, still own and manage most of the country's assets and big companies. </p> <p>Reg Rumney, the head of the thinktank BusinessMap, said: \"For political stability and progress everybody agreed we needed to move black people into the mainstream economy and redress inequality of ownership.\" </p> <p>With mining and financial corporations backing the empowerment laws, barely a week passes without a company handing shares and directorships to black people. </p> <p>The pace will quicken in the coming months as all sectors of the economy, from tourism and transport to healthcare and information technology, implement their transformation strategies. </p> <p>Last year there were 189 empowerment agreements worth \u00a33.6bn. A code of conduct to be published soon should increase the number, the trade and industry minister, Mandisi Mpahlwa, said. </p> <p>But critics say the juiciest deals keep going to the same people, invariably men with ANC connections. The most cited are Cyril Ramaphosa, Patrice Motsepe, Tokyo Sexwale and Saki Macozoma. </p> <p>Beginning in humble roles in the ANC and labour movement, all four are now immensely rich from stakes in mining, telecommunications, newspapers, banking and energy. </p> <p>Ajay Lalu, an empowerment consultant with Ernst &amp; Young, said: \"Calling them gentlemen of empowerment is too kind; they are the usual suspects. BEE has become part of the inner circle of the old boys' club.\" </p> <p>They deserved credit for seizing opportunities, and their success could inspire young black people to enter business, he said, but there would be trouble if they continued bagging the best deals. </p> <p>Other commentators have been harsher, comparing the \"over-empowered\" to Russia's oligarchs and the kleptocratic acolytes of Mobuto Sese Seko who looted Congo when it was called Zaire. </p> <p>Moeletsi Mbeki, a businessman and the brother of the man who devised the scheme, the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, called BEE a device for white-dominated corporations to build bridges with the ANC elite. \"It doesn't create wealth or add value to the economy,\" he said. </p> <p>With unemployment at 40% and millions in poverty, his accusation resonates with the Communist party, an ANC ally, which has questioned why banks spend billions of rands on empowerment deals while evicting the poor from their homes. </p> <p>Mr Rumney said it was too early to judge BEE, inspired by a similar policy in Malaysia which yielded mixed results, but that he was worried black businesses might be encouraged to expect handouts. </p> <p>He said the policy could also fail because of the well-established practice of corporations using black facades to mask white ownership and control. </p> <p>Black people control less than 4%, by value, of the shares on the Johannesburg securities exchange, and nine out of 10 senior management positions are held by white people. </p> <p>Empowerment's defenders say it is the only way to create a class of black entrepreneurs after the destruction of black business and education under apartheid. And the government has made it clear that it expects the policy to nurture smaller businesses in future. </p> <p>One entrepreneur wrote in a letter to the Johannesburg newspaper Business Day: \"Despite our crippling past, I now can also have business hopes and dreams. </p> <p>\"The white minority males can now take us seriously.\" </p> <p>The columnist Christine Qunta said that those who resented the new tycoons and complained about empowerment were racists. </p> <p>\"The real subtext is, of course, that Africans have no right to be millionaires. </p> <p>\"Like their mothers and fathers, they should spend their lives being gardeners, mine workers and domestic workers.\" </p> <p>None of the big tycoons were available for interview.</p>",
  "The British Army allowed a warrant officer with a known history of predatory sexual behaviour towards teenage boys to train young recruits at a controversial Surrey barracks, a court heard yesterday. <p>While at Deepcut barracks, Leslie Skinner, now 46, exploited his position of authority to subject \"vulnerable, naive\" teenagers to sado-masochistic sexual assaults, in some cases using riding whips and canes. </p> <p>Skinner, a father of two, faces a custodial sentence after yesterday admitting a string of sexual attacks on recruits aged 17 to 19, over five years. His victims were all in the very early stages of their army careers and remained silent about the assaults for up to 10 years because they knew Skinner was \"rank\" and in the army you did \"what you are told\". </p> <p>It was only two years ago, after one victim saw a BBC Kilroy programme on male rape and contacted police, that the scale of Skinner's offences was uncovered. </p> <p>Senior police officers said yesterday they were surprised that the army had installed him as physical training instructor at Deepcut, where most of his attacks took place, after court martialling him in 1996 for indecently exposing himself to a teenage boy. </p> <p>The revelations are likely to reignite calls for a public inquiry into Deepcut barracks, where police discovered a regime of bullying and inadequate supervision during an inquiry into the apparent suicides of four privates there between 1995 and 2002. </p> <p>Diane Gray, the mother of Private Geoff Gray, who was found fatally shot in 2001, said the case further exposed the army's negligence. </p> <p>\"They knew Skinner's background and they sent him down to Deepcut in the middle of an army barracks full of nice young men for him to exploit. It was like he was given young, vulnerable recruits on a plate,\" said Mrs Gray. </p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Pete O'Sullivan, who led the inquiry into Skinner, said the army's decision \"raised many questions.\" He added: \"It is for the army to justify why they kept him on and why they sent him to Deepcut.\" </p> <p>Appearing at Kingston crown court yesterday, Skinner, from Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, changed his plea at the last minute. He admitted five indecent assaults on four victims between 1992 and 1997. Another four indecent assaults and one charge of male rape were left on the file. </p> <p>His decision meant the four victims, two of whom are still in the army, were spared the trauma of having to re-live the attacks in court, police said. \"They were terrified of giving evidence,\" they said. </p> <p>Sally Howes, QC, prosecuting, said that Skinner subjected some of his victims to sado-masochistic attacks with riding whips and canes. \"He was always in a position of authority over the young men he assaulted. He exploited his position to take advantage of vulnerable and often naive young men.\" </p> <p>The first attack took place in 1992 while Skinner was a staff sergeant at Arnhem barracks, in Aldershot, Surrey. His victim, a 17-year-old, told police he was a sexually inexperienced teenager when he joined the army and that Skinner became his senior officer. In May that year the staff sergeant ordered the teenager into a room, told him to strip and then beat him across the buttocks with a riding crop. </p> <p>When the recruit asked him to stop, Skinner said: \"Stop being a poof.\" He continued the attack. He then ordered the teenager to beat him with the crop. The young man later told the police that he had not considered leaving the room because the consequences of disobeying an order appeared to be so great. </p> <p>\"He was the boss, and you do what the boss says,\" he said. </p> <p>Four years later - after Skinner had pleaded guilty at a court martial in Northern Ireland to exposing himself to a 17-year-old car park attendant - he was stripped of his rank of warrant officer and sent to Deepcut as a lance corporal, where he proceed to assault three more young men. </p> <p>One 18-year-old recruit, who worked with him as a gym assistant, became the victim of two serious sexual assaults in December 1996, after Skinner walked into his room at night. The victim told police he felt he could do nothing about the attack due to Skinner's superior rank and because then to confess to even non consensual homosexual activity could cause severe problems. </p> <p>Skinner will be sentenced on October 22.</p>",
  "A British soldier was charged yesterday with the murder of an Iraqi civilian, the first to appear before a criminal court since the invasion of the country. <p>Kevin Lee Williams, 21, a trooper with the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, appeared at Bow Street magistrates court in London, charged with the murder of Hassan Said on August 3 last year in Ad Dayr, southern Iraq. </p> <p>It is rare for a soldier to be sent to trial in a civilian court - as opposed to facing a court martial - over allegations involving incidents on active duty. </p> <p>In 1995, Scots guardsmen James Fisher, from Ayr, and Mark Wright, from Arbroath, Tayside, were sentenced to life for the murder of 18-year-old Peter McBride in Belfast. After serving three years, the pair were released and allowed to return to the army. </p> <p>Paratrooper Lee Clegg, from Bradford, was convicted of murder after shooting two teenage joyriders in Belfast in 1990.

He said yesterday he had referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service, who asked the Metropolitan police \"for assistance in collecting further evidence\". </p> <p>The Crown did not object to Trooper Williams being granted bail. He must stay at Catterick garrison, North Yorkshire, and not leave except by permission of an officer. He must report daily to the military police post at the barracks and surrender his passport. </p> <p>He is due to appear at the Old Bailey on September 28 for a preliminary hearing. </p> <p>At least five other British soldiers will face courts martial as a result of incidents in the British-controlled area of southern Iraq. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith announced in June that four soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers had been charged with indecent assault, \"which apparently involves making the victims engage in sexual activity between themselves\". </p> <p>The four - Lance Corporal Darren Larkin, Corporal Daniel Kenyon, Fusilier Gary Bartlam and Lance Corporal Mark Cooley - are also accused of military offences - prejudicing good order and military discipline. </p> <p>In a written statement in June, Lord Goldsmith said the case \"concerns conduct alleged to have occurred while the civilians were being temporarily detained, but not in a prison or detention facility\". </p> <p>Last May Fusilier Bartlam, 18, was arrested and questioned by military police after allegedly taking a film to be developed at a shop in Tamworth, Staffordshire. </p> <p>The photographs showed an Iraqi prisoner gagged and bound, stripped to the waist and suspended in the air by netting attached to a forklift truck.

  "The Rev Beyers Naud\u00e9, who has died aged 89, was one of the most respected and loved stalwarts of South Africa's liberation struggle, and a man who played a crucial role in supporting the underground movement of the African National Congress (ANC). On his 80th birthday, the then South African president, Nelson Mandela, praised his life as a \"shining beacon\". \"It demonstrates what it means to rise above race, to be a true South African,\" Mandela observed. <p>What was remarkable about Naud\u00e9, however, was that instead of becoming an icon of the liberation struggle, he could easily have risen to the top of white exclusivity - and, in particular, of the Dutch Reformed Church, which played a central role in justifying the philosophy of apartheid. He came from an entrenched Afrikaner nationalist background, and spent his early years as a Dutch Reformed minister. After his rejection of apartheid, he was denounced as a traitor and ostracised by many whites. </p> <p>Born in Roodeport, outside Johannesburg, Naud\u00e9 was the son of Jozua Fran\u00e7ois Naud\u00e9, a Dutch Reformed minister who carried out some of the first biblical translations into Afrikaans and helped entrench it as an official South African language. He was also the first chairman of the Broederbond, a secret society of Afrikaner leaders that was to become synonymous with the governments under apartheid. </p> <p>After completing his MA in languages at Stellenbosch University, the bedrock of Afrikaner intellectualism, Beyers Naud\u00e9 attended the Stellenbosch school of theology, where he mixed with such men as Hendrik Verwoerd and John Vorster, both later apartheid prime ministers. In 1940, he married Ilse Weder, daughter of a Moravian missionary, and joined the Broederbond himself. </p> <p>He became assistant minister at the Dutch Reformed church in Wellington, outside Cape Town, and, until 1960, preached across the country, his beliefs apparently in step with the racial segregation philosophy of the ruling National party (NP). </p> <p>However, the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, in which government troops killed 69 black demonstrators, was to be one of the events that triggered Naud\u00e9's move away from the Afrikaner establishment and towards the liberation movements. His political awareness had already been sharpened in the university town of Potchefstroom, where he was exposed to clerics and Broederbonders who questioned aspects of the apartheid policies. </p> <p>Thus, in 1961, Naud\u00e9 became a founder member of the Christian Institute, an ecumenical organisation that became increasingly drawn into liberation politics, and was one of the few organisations (along with the Institute of Race Relations) to provide a voice against apartheid. </p> <p>In the wake of his involvement with the Christian Institute, Naud\u00e9 came under increasing pressure from the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1963, he resigned as acting moderator of the Southern Transvaal Dutch Reformed Church Synod, and became director of the institute. He was stripped of his status as a minister, and shortly afterwards announced his resignation from the Broederbond. </p> <p>His work at the Christian Institute brought him into direct conflict with the security police. His staff were intimidated, their offices raided, and, in 1973, the institute itself was the subject of investigation by parliament's Schlebusch commission. </p> <p>Naud\u00e9 refused to testify and, in 1976, spent a night in jail after losing an appeal against a conviction for failing to testify and refusing to pay a fine. He was banned between 1977 and 1985, which meant his movements were restricted and he could not talk to more than one person at a time. Ordained into the African Reformed Church, from 1985 to 1987 he was general secretary of the South African Council of Churches, succeeding Archbishop Desmond Tutu. </p> <p>Naud\u00e9 rarely spoke about his work in the liberation struggle - even to those close to him - and was guarded about the nature of his relationship with the ANC. He often appeared to be affiliated to it, and was close to many of its operatives. Indeed, in 1990, he was part of the first delegation of ANC leaders, including Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Joe Slovo, to meet senior figures in the apartheid government. But despite his proximity to the movement, Naud\u00e9 always maintained an independence. He never sought acknowledgement or status in political structures. </p> <p>Indeed, he sometimes demonstrated an openness that bordered on naivety. On one occasion, the security police attempted to trap him, using an agent posing as an ANC emissary. The police agent approached Naud\u00e9, claimed to be on a mission, and asked for money. Naud\u00e9 duly obliged, and was immediately set upon by the security police for helping an ANC operative. Under questioning, Naud\u00e9, who always saw the irony of a situation, said he was a man of the cloth, and had naturally sought to help someone claiming to be \"on a mission\". </p> <p>Naud\u00e9 always cherished his independence. When he helped ANC cadres, it was never under a directive from the ANC. He was sometimes criticised by ANC members for backing other organisations, such as the black consciousness movement, advanced by the activist Steve Biko, who was murdered by the security police in 1977. </p> <p>Under apartheid, the Afrikaner community shunned Naud\u00e9. His wife's family had a holiday home in the seaside town of Onrust, a favourite haunt of NP leaders. Naud\u00e9 went there every year, and every year he was ignored. But once the tide started to turn in South Africa in the late 1980s, his reception in Onrust changed. After 1994, when he was welcomed back into the Dutch Reformed Church, he spoke to conservative congregations across the country, advancing the spirit of reconciliation that was the hallmark of the Mandela presidency. </p> <p>Naud\u00e9's many honours included doctorates from the universities of Amsterdam, Witwatersrand, Notre Dame, in the US, and Cape Town. Those who worked with him in the struggle all remember his unfailing humility and selflessness. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Christiaan Beyers Naud\u00e9, clergyman and anti-apartheid activist, born May 10 1915; died September 7 2004</p>",

  "Far from our approach to betting exchanges being a gamble, the gambling bill will actually make cheating much harder (Leaders, September 2). The bill will create a powerful new regulator, the gambling commission, which will take over the regulation of bookmakers and betting exchanges. This means that, for the first time, we will have a dedicated team of betting investigators armed with new powers, including the ability to void unfair bets, carry out investigations and bring about prosecutions. <p>The bill will also impose strict controls on exchanges, including a requirement to register all customer details and make this information available to the gambling commission. </p> <p>Betting exchanges are a new phenomenon and another example of why our gambling laws need updating. I'm confident that under the rigorous regulation of the gambling commission, they can continue without putting the integrity of gambling at stake. <br><b>Tessa Jowell MP </b><br> Secretary of state for Culture, Media and Sport </p> <p>It is a matter of concern that the large increase in William Hill's profits, as well as those of Ladbroke's reported last month, is significantly due to the fixed-odds betting terminals in betting shops (William Hill raises virtual roulette stakes, September 7). </p> <p>This is an addictive form of gaming, which should be confined to casinos. The availability of FOBTs in betting shops illustrates the insiduous manner in which the government has succumbed to gambling promoter pressure.

  "Alan Milburn's return to frontline politics will further fuel speculation that he will one day challenge Gordon Brown for the leadership of the Labour party. <p>Before that, however, he will have to work with the chancellor on general election planning and policy for Labour's likely third term, both issues that his potential leadership rival believes he should have a key role in.</p> <p>The two men fell out when Mr Milburn pursued a belligerent Blairite agenda as health secretary. His proposal to establish semi-autonomous foundation hospitals infuriated the chancellor, who opposed allowing them to undertake their own borrowing, as well as alarming many Labour backbenchers.</p> <p>It was, however, left to John Reid to take the plans through the House of Commons, when Mr Milburn abandoned high office 18 months ago to spend more time with his family.</p> <p>On the backbenches, he renewed his partnership with fellow ex-cabinet minister, Stephen Byers, acting as ideological outriders to the Blairite project, urging greater reform of public services. In that role, he took on the chairmanship of Progress, the New Labour loyalist pressure group, and contributed ideas to the party's manifesto. </p> <p>But despite his New Labour credentials, Mr Milburn's background was on the hard left - he was even rumoured to have been a member of Tariq Ali's International Marxist Group. He ran a leftwing bookshop, Days of Hope (nicknamed \"Haze of Dope\") after he abandoned his PhD on 18th century radicalism in the north-east.</p> <p>Born on January 27 1958, Mr Milburn was brought up single-handedly by his mother, a secretary in the local NHS, in the County Durham mining village of Tow Law, which has since been described as a \"staunch Labour environment\". He attended state school in Newcastle and Cleveland before going on to Lancaster University for his BA in history. His uncompleted PhD was begun at Newcastle University. </p> <p>His modest background is said to have influenced his determination to reform the welfare state. \"I grew up on a council housing estate in the middle of County Durham, and it isn't a very nice thing when you come home from school and find your door, which was red in the morning, has been painted yellow,\" he said. \"My mum had not agreed for it to be painted yellow, someone from the council did.\" </p> <p>Active in politics in the north-east, Mr Milburn edited a trade union-sponsored tabloid newspaper, Rostrum as well as chairing Trade Union CND. Milburn landed a job with the county council-backed trade union studies information unit, and masterminded the campaign to save shipbuilding in Sunderland. </p> <p>Though unsuccessful, the experience of high-profile campaigning is understood to have convinced the young activist that he could make it in national politics. The long hair and the beard had already gone, and the search for a safe seat was soon to begin. </p> <p>Mr Milburn landed the seat of Darlington in 1992 and soon became a well-known backbencher. With his office-mate and fellow north-east MP Mr Byers, he repeatedly embarrassed the then Conservative government with a string of probing parliamentary questions; the answers to which were inevitably countered by reams of press releases. </p> <p>His success in generating media attention meant he was marked out as a high-flyer from virtually the moment Tony Blair took over the Labour leadership in 1994. </p> <p>Once Labour took office in 1997, Mr Milburn was appointed a junior health minister in charge of promoting private finance initiative (PFI) projects to build new hospitals with the controversial public-private partnerships. In 1998, he joined the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury, working under his future rival, Mr Brown. A year later he succeeded Frank Dobson as health secretary. </p> <p>His vision of the 21st century NHS, involving increased involvement for private contractors and greater freedoms for local managers, chimed very closely with the ideas of the prime minister himself. Mr Milburn's commitment to NHS reforms - including PFI and foundation hospitals - made him a controversial figure on the left of the party, and he clashed with consultants over pay, when they rejected the new contracts he offered them. </p> <p>Mr Milburn's family life has not always been so happy. He split with his first wife, Mo O'Tool, who is now an MEP. He is now, however, happily settled with psychiatrist partner Ruth Briel, with whom he has two sons. Domestic bliss, and the desire the see his children grow up, have not however stopped him answering the call of a return to office.</p>",
  "Alan Johnson was appointed higher education minister last year with the task of selling the government's complex top-up fees package to doubting backbenchers. His success in steering the controversial legislation through the Commons accounts for his promotion today. <p>Mr Johnson's experience as leader of the Communication Workers' Union, and as a government whip, had prepared him well for 16 months of parliamentary persuasion and arm-twisting.</p> <p>The minister has no university education, which raised a few eyebrows along the corridors of academia. But his strong working-class credentials went down well with the Labour left, the strongest opponents of top-up fees. </p> <p>Self-confident and sharp-suited, he schmoozed his way through academia and, more importantly, the back benches. He won over key rebels such as Anne Campbell, MP for Cambridge, an arch opponent of top-up fees and the original architect of a campaign to introduce a flat-rate increase instead. His style of negotiating worked in his favour, as people believed he was listening to their concerns. </p> <p>The bill was passed by just five votes at its second reading in the Commons in January - the smallest majority of any bill under the Blair government. However, when the legislation was confirmed last month with very few amendments, the earlier narrow escape was irrelevant.</p> <p>The closest Mr Johnson got to a scandal was a row with Liverpool students after he suggested that children on Merseyside's poorest estates \"might as well go to Pluto as to university\". He was, of course, on the side of the students, his spokesman later clarified. Compared with his predecessor Margaret Hodge's stint as higher education minister, this incident was extremely minor. </p> <p>Thirteen months ago, the higher education brief was considered one of the toughest outside the cabinet. Now Mr Johnson faces an equally tough task: negotiating a course between the government's two most powerful figures, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, at the department of work and pensions.</p> <p>His support for top-up fees marks Mr Johnson out as a Blairite, although trade unionists usually prefer the chancellor's championing of traditional Labour values. Wherever he stands in the government's perpetual feud, he will have to work with Mr Brown. As the largest spending minister in Westminster, he now depends on Mr Brown's good grace as he faces the twin challenges of restoring trust in the pensions industry and persuading some of Britain's 2.7 million incapacity benefit claimants into work.</p> <p>Labour backbenchers and party members will approve of his appointment, especially as it harks back to a more traditional Labour age. Mr Johnson today becomes the first former trade union leader to reach the cabinet since the T&amp;G's Frank Cousins in 1964.</p>",
  "MPs are to be given a free vote on a bill to ban hunting of foxes with hounds and hare-coursing, the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, announced today. <p>Mr Michael said a date for the Commons debate would be announced tomorrow by the leader of the house, Peter Hain. It is widely expected to take place on Wednesday next week, with a vote the same day. </p> <p>Announcing plans to reintroduce the hunting bill, which was blocked by peers last year, Mr Michael stressed that outlawing hunting was not a priority for the government. </p> <p>But he said the government intended to fulfil its manifesto commitment to enable parliament to settle the issue before the next general election. </p> <p>Mr Michael will ask MPs to agree to postpone the implementation of the foxhunting ban for two years after the bill - which applies only to England and Wales - is passed, in order to minimise the impact on rural communities. But he said it was intended that the hare-coursing ban should come into effect three months after the bill received royal assent.</p> <p>The minister made it clear that the government was ready to invoke the Parliament Act to force the bill through if the House of Lords attempted to block a vote in favour by MPs. That would mean the law would most likely be in place at the time of the next election.</p> <p>The Conservatives immediately signalled their intention to repeal the law if they form the next government.</p> <p>Countryside Alliance chief executive Simon Hart said the news would \"signal an outright assault on everyone who believes in freedom and tolerance\". </p> <p>He added: \"The alliance, its members and supporters, having always acted in good faith, are furious that the government has abandoned its promise to resolve this matter on 'evidence and principle' in an act of political vandalism. </p> <p>\"The wider public will ask how a prime minister who last week pledged that his policies would benefit hard-working families can justify this vicious, prejudiced attack on families across the country. </p> <p>\"The government - and the prime minister in particular - has caved in to the vindictive obsession of its backbench and put hunting above schools, hospitals and pensions in a way that will haunt it up to and beyond the general election. </p> <p>\"A government using emergency legislation to appease its backbenchers is a government in crisis.\" </p> <p>Douglas Batchelor, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the hunting bill is coming back to the House of Commons. </p> <p>\"This heralds the high point of our 80-year campaign to expose fox hunting as a cruel sport and to get it banned. \"We are very concerned, however, at the suggestion that the Government might be asking MPs to vote to delay implementation of the ban by a further period. We simply cannot see any good reason for a delay.</p> <p>\"MPs have made the moral decision that hunting with dogs is unacceptable in a modern society, and this decision should come into effect as soon as possible. </p> <p>\"Hunts do not need a longer lead-in period. They can carry on hunting as long as they take the fox out of the process. </p> <p>\"They can switch very quickly to drag hunting, following an artificial scent. A longer delay than the three months in the original Hunting bill is unnecessary and disproportionate.\" </p> <p>Shadow environment secretary Tim Yeo stiffened the Conservatives' opposition to the government's apparent move to speed through a ban on hunting. </p> <p>He committed a future Conservative administration to reversing the ban. </p> <p>Mr Yeo said: \"If Labour railroad through a bill to ban hunting using the Parliament Act we will introduce a government bill to reverse Labour's ban. </p> <p>\"All Conservatives, front- and backbench, will be allowed a free vote in both houses. The vast majority of Conservatives believe a ban is an infringement of civil liberties and damaging to the countryside.\" </p> <p>Explaining the plan for a two-year delay in implementation of the foxhunting ban, Mr Michael said: \"This period will give those involved in hunting more than adequate time to cease the activities which are to be banned, for humane arrangements, like the dispersal or re-homing of dogs, and for refocusing any business activities on alternatives like drag-hunting or disposal of fallen stock if they wish to do so. </p> <p>\"These welfare considerations do not apply to hare coursing events. Violence and intimidation associated with illegal coursing events is a real and pressing problem in many areas of the countryside today. </p> <p>Mr Michael added: \"The government has condemned threats of illegal action by some supporters of hunting and believes that most people involved are law-abiding people who are prepared to respect the will of parliament. </p> <p>\"Extra time for implementation will make it even clearer that illegal actions and threats or intimidation are totally unjustified. If people wish to continue their opposition to legislation, they have the option of the ballot box through which to express their views.\"</p>",
  "The US today drafted a resolution to the UN security council, threatening Sudan with sanctions on its oil output if does not rein in Arab militia fighters in the Darfur region. <p>The text, seen by Reuters, demands Sudan submits the names of Janjaweed militiamen it has disarmed and arrested for abuses, and calls for the establishment of an enlarged African Union monitoring force with an extended mandate.</p> <p>It does not set a deadline by which Sudan must comply, but diplomats have told the news agency that one could be added during negotiations with council members.</p> <p>The Janjaweed are accused of killing, raping and driving out villagers in Darfur, allegedly with the tacit support of the national government in Khartoum. More than one million people have been driven from their land over the last 18 months.</p> <p>A UN report published yesterday said the Janjaweed had attacked two villages in the region during the past week, despite the government's commitment to disarm the militias and protect civilians.</p> <p>The report added that security was becoming an increasing problem in Darfur, with incidents of banditry - including the armed robbery of cash and communications equipment from two clearly marked UN vehicles - more widespread.</p> <p>\"Agencies fear the security situation may further deteriorate. Reported clashes between GoS [Sudanese government] and [rebel] forces have been compounded by increasing incidents of armed robbery, including on humanitarian workers, mainly in north and south Darfur states,\" the report said.</p> <p>The security council threatened to consider imposing unspecified \"international measures\" in its July 30 resolution if Sudan failed to disarm and prosecute the Janjaweed. The new draft resolution threatens punitive measures \"including with regard to the petroleum sector\" or against individual members of the government. </p> <p>Sanctions have a slim chance of gaining approval this time around, but the US wants to increase the pressure on Khartoum so that punitive measures are more likely to be adopted in the future.</p> <p>Sudan has said it will accept an increase in the 80 African Union monitors and 300 troops deployed to protect them, but has warned it will not do so if their mandate is expanded. The draft resolution calls for the African Union monitors to investigate all abuses, and visit refugee camps.</p> <p>The fighting in Darfur began in February last year following a ceasefire deal in Sudan's civil war which split oil revenues and land between the Arab northern and black southern Sudanese. </p> <p>Rebels in Darfur, in the west, demanded a fairer deal for the region's black African population, taking up arms against government forces and installations. Khartoum responded by arming the Arab Janjaweed militias, who gained the upper hand over the rebels.</p> <p>The Janjaweed then escalated the fight by driving African villagers from their homes and into camps, and the UN estimates that around 50,000 people have been killed. The World Food Programme has said heavy rains and fighting between rebel and government forces have created access problems for its aid workers.</p> <p>Khartoum has said it does not control the Janjaweed - whom it describes as outlaws - and is not responsible for their actions. </p> <p>Angelo Beda, the deputy speaker of the Sudanese parliament, this week described the Janjaweed as a \"a gang of thugs\", and accused the US of conspiring against Sudan's government.</p> <p>\"Sudan is not afraid of the threat of sanctions by the United States, which is using the crisis in Darfur to weaken and destroy the government of Sudan in a similar fashion in which they devastated Iraq and Somalia,\" he told a press conference in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.</p> <p>The Sudanese government and Darfur rebels have been holding peace talks in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, but progress has been slow. On Tuesday, analysts said the talks had reached an impasse because of weak diplomatic pressure on the rebels.</p>",
  "<p>Tabloid journalism is a tricky subject: it tends to invite lofty condescension. But, although Joe Penhall's new 90-minute play largely avoids that, it lacks the moral dilemmas that make for gripping drama and that informed Steve Thompson's recent zestier newspaper play, Damages, at the Bush. </p> <p>Penhall writes well about the process of tabloid entrapment. Set in a swanky hotel, his play shows Barry, a TV comic, being lavishly courted by a pair of pseudo-bankers. The air is thick with the promise of undeclared money and sex as the mini-dressed Liz and the noxious Greg nourish Barry's post-performance high. Things get even higher when Barry and Liz later meet alone and he hits the drink and drugs before making a fumbling pass. </p> <p>All this is merely the prelude to the revelation that Greg is a redtop Investigations Editor and Liz his sidekick. But, having exposed the sting, Penhall settles largely for point-making. Some of his points are perfectly valid: that tabloid journalists cloak themselves in moral indignation, that they get an adrenaline-rush from impersonation and that they are part of a corrupt culture in which celebrities are first elevated then destroyed. I don't feel disposed to argue with this: I just wished, for the sake of drama, someone else would. </p> <p>Clearly the play's most intriguing figure is Barry whom Douglas Hodge plays superbly as a weak, biddable man whose life and career are both on the skids; merely to watch Hodge's eyes flicker with greed at a notional fee for a post-prandial talk is an education in the art of acting. But, although Penhall acutely suggests there is a symbiotic relationship between the prey and the predator, he ducks the larger issues. He never explores the real conflict between necessary investigation and unwarranted intrusion. He also focuses on the journalistic piranhas without asking how much their ethical code stems from the mega-sharks who own and control the newspapers - precisely the topic raised in Hare and Brenton's Pravda. </p> <p>On its own level, the play is perfectly watchable. And, even if Rupert Graves can't do much with the vacuously reptilian Greg, Anna Maxwell Martin neatly contrasts Liz's leg-brandishing enticement with her later stern censoriousness. Terry Johnson's production also brings out the play's laconic comedy. But, having raised big ethical issues in Blue/Orange, Penhall here simply exposes the seamy side of tabloid journalism and suggests its readers are complicit in its infectious celebrity-baiting. What he never asks is who poisoned the well in the first place. </p> <p>\u00b7 Until October 9. Box office: 020-7565 5000.</p>",
  "<p>Conservative plans to abolish tuition fees for undergraduates were greeted politely today by university vice-chancellors, who earlier this year supported the government's bill to introduce them. Of course, Universities UK, which represents university heads, must appear non-partisan and at least appear to consider all the plans politicians produce.</p> <p>Students are less inhibited. The National Union of Students furiously denounced its erstwhile allies during the battle over the higher education bill - that alliance was never going to last forever. Whether 18-year-olds more generally - and their parents - will be tempted to vote Tory for the sake of owing a bit less remains to be seen.</p> <p>From the universities' point of view, the important thing is to get more money - and if the opposition is promising more funding and less bureaucracy, it is in the universities' interests to keep the debate going in the hope that it may strengthen their hand during discussions over the government's current spending review. </p> <p>But the courteous, if rather guarded, response from Ivor Crewe, president of UUK, may indicate that the Tories have at last begun to think seriously about higher education funding after flailing around for the past couple of years. The Blair government was nearly brought down by tuition fees - but it wasn't, and now the opposition has started to study the matter properly. </p> <p>The result is that the shadow education minister, Tim Collins, and his colleagues have confronted some issues and avoided others. </p> <p>Abolishing interest rate subsidies has a lot to justify it. It gives a massive taxpayers' subsidy to the middle classes and as Nicholas Barr and Ian Crawford, architects of the government's fees and loans policy, argued, it helps well-off graduates, not poor students. One can understand why no government felt it could introduce fees and real rates of interest on student loans all in one go - politically impossible - but sooner or later these subsidies are going to be phased out. But the Conservatives need to show how certain groups - notably mothers taking career breaks - would be protected (actually Professor Barr has an ingenious mechanism to do just that).</p> <p>But Professor Barr, of the London School of Economics, has pointed out the regressive impact of abolishing fees, which fall heaviest on the better off at the moment. </p> <p>Shifting university funding from the current mix of students fees and government grants to a new National Scholarship scheme (in effect, vouchers) is designed to look radical - the university equivalent of freeing the Bank of England from political control - and give the impression that, from now on, universities will be free to set their own numbers. The 50% target will be abolished.</p> <p>But how free would universities really be? Is a future Conservative government really going to give the sector a blank cheque and let universities recruit as many students as they want? Kenneth Baker, when he was education secretary in the late 1980s, did manage to bamboozle the Treasury into signing such a cheque and the result was a mushroom expansion, especially in the polytechnics. But it's hard to imagine any chancellor of the exchequer letting that happen again. </p> <p>Nor is Mr Collins leaving universities free to fill up with media studies students. \"A minimum proportion of National Scholarships will be reserved for key strategic study areas such as science, engineering and modern languages,\" states the party's proposal.</p> <p>Some vice-chancellors, like Michael Driscoll at Middlesex University, fear the plan would, in practice, mean freezing the number of students, with implications for widening access to working class and ethnic minority students - an area where the new universities have led the way.</p>",
  "<p>I've just been reading about EA's forthcoming first-person shooter <a href=\"http://www.eagames.com/official/goldeneye/rogueagent/us/home.jsp\">GoldenEye Rogue Agent</a> and have been truly amazed by the developer's efforts to literalise the game title. If you haven't caught the pre-publicity surrounding this game, it works like this: you control a rogue MI5 agent who has lost an eye in a fight with legendary baddie Dr No. Luckily, however, Scaramanga \u2013 the one with three nipples in The Man With The Golden Gun \u2013 rescues the blinded agent and equips him with a robotic cyber-eye, made of gold. Hence\u2026 GoldenEye.</p> <p>But the literal thinking doesn't end there.</p> <p> </p> <p>It turns out that this eye gives your character a range of special psychic abilities, allowing you to chuck baddies around the room with the power of thought alone. But as a necessary gameplay mechanic to limit use, there's an energy bar that runs down whenever the feature is in operation, and you can only renew the bar by performing skill moves. To explain <em>this</em> the designers have come up with the idea that the eye draws on brain energy that is omitted when such moves are performed.</p> <p>This naturalistic approach to game design is admirable, but it runs counter to the 'it just does, okay?' philosophy that quietly underpins videogaming. I'm not just talking about the highly abstract early years \u2013 the hungry yellow circles being chased round mazes by ghosts \u2013 I'm talking about the way games, even today, simply <em>have</em> to break a few rules to function as interactive experiences.</p> <p>Take for example, the abundant health and ammo packs that litter the environments in first person shooters. When a developer tries to really deal with the unreality of this situation, they often end up looking silly. In Resident Evil for example, you were forced to pick up green and red herbs for health \u2013 fine, you might think, herbs are more likely to be littered around an old manor house than first-aid kits. However, how many herbs are there that instantly heal gaping zombie attack wounds?</p> <p>Better still, in Sony's action adventure The Getaway, the player had to recover from bullet wounds by leaning against a wall and having a bit of a rest. Again, it was no more realistic than coming across a magical health pack \u2013 it simply drew more attention to the artifice underpinning the notion of universally available panaceas.</p> <p>GoldenEye looks like it might be a very entertaining game, and EA's decision to let you play as the bad guy is pretty brave for such a mega-corp. But someone needs to tell the marketing chaps to lighten up. No one cared <em>why</em> the original movie was called GoldenEye, and no one will care <em>why</em> the agent they're controlling has a robot eye that must be regularly juiced up by performing special moves. This is the kind of crazy stuff that games ask us to do all the time. If the game is good enough, we'll do it without question. It's best not to draw attention to the absurdities of the videogame universe \u2013 the whole thing might unravel.</p>",
  "<p>Claire Watkinson's baby is due this week, and what she would really like when she goes into labour is to stay put. \"I like the idea of giving birth in familiar surroundings,\" she says. \"I think I'd be more relaxed and I know there's research to show I'd have a better chance of a trouble-free delivery. And I like the idea of being at home straight after the birth - I think it would be easier to settle into a routine with the baby.\" </p> <p>Watkinson has had a straightforward pregnancy, and from a medical point of view she has been told there should be no problem with a home delivery: it is now generally acknowledged that for women without medical problems, birth at home is at least as safe as birth in hospital. Despite that, though, for Watkinson a home delivery isn't an option - because she lives in Peterborough. She is one of the current victims of what has become known as the home-birth lottery - the fact that, increasingly, it is not your state of health or your obstetric record that dictates whether or not you can give birth at home, but your postcode. </p> <p>Any choice Watkinson had about whether or not to give birth at home - a choice the Department of Health supports and says every woman should have - disappeared a few weeks ago when a message was scrawled on a whiteboard at the Peterborough Hospital maternity unit. It said that Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Trust had decided to suspend its home-birth service until further notice. Watkinson, who says her midwife had seemed as keen as she was on the possibility of being with her for a home birth, heard the news at a parentcraft class, and was very disappointed. </p> <p>Another Peterborough midwife who read the whiteboard message was Paul Beland, a community midwife with 11 years' experience and a big supporter of home deliveries. He had to break the news to a client that her planned home birth had been banned. But when the client, Louise Cutteridge, went into labour a fortnight later, he attended her at her home for the delivery of an 8lb 8oz boy, Jonny. Three days later the trust suspended him and he has since been dismissed. </p> <p>Beland says he knew all about the trust's home-birth suspension when he agreed to go to Cutteridge's aid - but, crucially, he didn't think it was sustainable. He believes that a midwife's first obligation is to a patient, not an employer. \"The guidance given to midwives is contradictory,\" he says. \"It says we have a contractual duty to our employer, but also a professional duty to provide care for women and it acknowledges that we would not wish to leave a woman in labour at home unattended, placing her at risk. </p> <p>\"I was being told I couldn't attend a birth at home as a trust employee, but I knew that as a midwife I couldn't leave a client to give birth without professional care. My interpretation of this was that my duties as a midwife were overriding. But that's not how the trust saw it.\" </p> <p>Beland is planning to appeal against the trust's decision to sack him, and may also take a case of unfair dismissal against his former employer. \"Their case would be that I didn't follow a reasonable instruction, so what I'd have to do is argue that the instruction was unreasonable.\" </p> <p>It's an instruction that certainly seems unreasonable to women who may be weeks or even days away from a home delivery they have been looking forward to and planning for. And if a home-birth service is suspended, women are usually powerless to do anything about it. Pregnant women, like other patients, have the right to get themselves referred to the care of another health trust - but trusts will not, for understandable geographical reasons, provide home-delivery services for women who live beyond their boundaries. The only other option, if it is an option at all, is to pay around \u00a32,000 for the services of an independent midwife who works outside the NHS and specialises in home delivery. But not all areas of the country have independent midwives working in them: Peterborough, for example, has none. </p> <p>Sometimes it doesn't even take anything as formal as a message on a whiteboard to dash a woman's dream of a home delivery. Cathy Warwick, midwifery head at King's College Hospital, London, chairs the midwives committee at the Nursing and Midwifery Council. She says she gets letters from women who say they were \"duped\" into believing they were going to have a home delivery, only to have the chance withdrawn at the last possible moment. \"They say they booked for a home birth and were told they could go for a home birth and then, with just two or four weeks to go, they were told that staff shortages meant there was little or no chance that it could go ahead, and that they would probably need to come into the unit to deliver. </p> <p>\"It's very, very, very unfair. I think it's worse than being told from the outset that there isn't a home-birth service at all. That would be a tragedy, but doing this is dishonesty.\" </p> <p>No one is sure how widespread the practice is of suspending a home-birth service, or of withdrawing the option to individual women at the last minute. Some women complain, others - no doubt distracted by the demands of a new baby - don't. There is no single place to go - some contact the Nursing and Midwifery Council, others their own health trusts, some the National Childbirth Trust, which later this year plans a survey to find out more about the extent of the problem. But there is evidence that more women than are currently getting one would like a home birth: research done by the NCT in 2001 found that one in five women is interested in finding out more about home births but only about one in 50 actually goes on to have one. </p> <p>What is clear is that in some areas there is a strong pro-home-birth policy - with correspondingly high home-birth figures, and no history of ever withdrawing the service - while in others there is little beyond an acknowledgement that \"it's available if it's what women want\" and a service that is vulnerable to being cut at short notice if there are staff or funding problems. </p> <p>Mandy Renton, general manager of the woman and child service unit at the Peterborough Trust, says there isn't a huge demand for home births in her area. \"Women here haven't been asking for them,\" she says. \"It's my role to respond to what they are asking for.\" She says home births keep two midwives tied up at a patient's home when they could be helping several women in labour in the maternity unit. </p> <p>Critics argue that midwifery heads such as Renton should be staffing women, not units. \"They say it's about resources, but if the service was managed differently then home deliveries could make far more efficient use of a midwife's time,\" says Beland. \"A labour ward has to be staffed round the clock at the same level, regardless of whether it's packed or there's just one woman there. With a home birth, the midwife's skills are concentrated on where and when they're really needed: with a woman in labour.\" </p> <p>Peterborough is certainly a far cry from south Devon, where the home-birth rate is around 11% compared with a national average of 2.5%. In south Devon, home delivery is the very first suggestion made to newly pregnant women by midwives when the subject of where to have the baby crops up. And, says Lynne Leyshon, head of midwifery there, there's no pressure to decide early about whether to go for home or hospital. \"Women can decide to stay at home as late as when they go into labour,\" she explains. \"You often don't know what you'd really like until the last minute. We send a midwife to make an assessment at home once labour has started and, if all is going well, a woman often just decides to stay put.\" </p> <p>Leyshon's service is revered the country over by organisations that support choice in childbirth: Mary Newburn of the NCT says that she is exactly the sort of inspired, far-sighted midwifery manager the NHS needs to make a difference to its often derided, midwife-starved service. While Renton in Peterborough is moaning about having one in 10 midwifery posts vacant and having to advertise as far away as Australia for new recruits, Leyshon in Devon has a list of midwives who are queuing up to work for her - and not just because the countryside is lovely. </p> <p>The obvious conclusion is that providing a thriving home-birth service is about a lot more than giving women an option: it is also a sign of a contented and valued midwifery workforce. What's more, trusts with a good home-birth rate often have a midwife-run birth centre - a kind of \"home from home\" unit, where women are encouraged to have drug-free deliveries. And, since research shows home births and birth-centre births tend to require lower rates of intervention and to end less often in emergency caesareans, they are also less likely to be battling with ever-spiralling caesarean section rates, which everyone from midwives' groups to the government now believe should be cut. </p> <p>For Beland, the way forward is simple: instead of just supporting a woman's right to ask for a home birth, the government should enshrine the right to home delivery clearly, and in law. But not everyone is convinced: some activists will tell you, privately, that if the issue was pushed to wide public debate they're not so sure that it wouldn't go the other way, and we might end up seeing a law that required all women to deliver their babies in hospital. </p> <p>One thing that would help, they say, is more evidence about the safety issue. Research is already clear about how safe and sensible home birth is: if you're a low-risk mother and you plan a home birth, for example, you are half as likely as the same mother who books into hospital to end up needing a caesarean, a forceps or ventouse delivery. It's also less likely that your baby will need special care, and you will find it easier to establish breastfeeding. But for decades the public was persuaded by the medical profession and the political establishment that hospital was safe and home was risky, and turning that deeply engrained perception around will take time and more statistical evidence. </p> <p>The Nursing and Midwifery Council, meanwhile, is reviewing the guidelines it issues to midwives who, like Beland, find themselves being pulled one way by an employer and another way by their heart and their patient. If Beland does decide to pursue a case for unfair dismissal, the outcome of that will be significant. </p> <p>At the sharp end, though, it is still women like Watkinson who are paying the price. Renton says she hopes Peterborough's current crisis will be over by the end of the month and that the home birth service can then be reinstated. But that is too late for Watkinson: her baby will have been born by then. In hospital.</p>",
  "<p>Sue, 44, has more than 20 years' experience as a social worker. For the past eight years, she has been job sharing as a team leader in local authority children's services earning \u00a316,000. She now wants a full-time post. What are her options?</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Social worker staff training and development for a local authority, with a salary up to \u00a328,173, is a possibility for Sue. Responsibilities include developing a workforce plan, identifying training needs of social workers and managers, and creating attractive career paths. The post gets her away from casework. Her NVQ level 4 in care management and her professional social worker qualification are advantages.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Sue might like to work for the Social Care Institute for Excellence as one of its five practice development managers, earning between \u00a331,450 and \u00a344,400. Her experience would be useful in developing guides for improving practice. Responsibilities include commissioning experts to review literature and practice, as well as identifying examples of best practice. She would put these to the test, making sure they worked well.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> If Sue wants to be at the forefront of social work registration, which becomes compulsory from April, she might become an administrative officer for the General Social Care Council, checking registration applications against its data system. Earning \u00a316,000, she could go on to become a team leader, which has a \u00a320,000 salary. The council's work is fast expanding and future career options are varied, including influencing education and training.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> If a focus on preventive social care is what Sue is after, she might consider becoming a social worker for Sure Start - the government's multi-agency programme for children and parents - earning \u00a326,625. Her statutory sector background is useful. Career development is good, with opportunities to move into management or public health.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Sue's social work skills in assessment and supervision, and her experience of working with families, means she is an ideal candidate to become a youth offending team officer. She would have to study for the professional certificate of effective practice in youth justice, which is likely to become a registration requirement for social workers in youth justice. The full-time salary is around \u00a332,000.</p>",
  "The issue of pensions dominated the first prime ministers' questions since the summer recess today, as Tony Blair ridiculed a new Liberal Democrat policy to raise the state pension to over \u00a3100 a week and a thousand pensioners lobbied MPs outside parliament. <p>As the three main party leaders clashed for the first time since the holidays, the prime minister took issue with the Lib Dems - whose policy closely echoes the new <a href=\"http://www.pensionersmanifesto.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">\"pensioners' manifesto\"</a> launched by the National Pensioners Convention (NPC) today - over how they would fund the triple-figure weekly pension payments and a restore the link with average earnings.</p> <p>Charles Kennedy called for action to end \"blatant discrimination\" which sees the average woman receive just \u00a351 a week in basic state pension and said that two-fifths of pensioners - two million people - were not receiving the means-tested benefits to which they are entitled. </p> <p>However, Mr Blair appeared to score a decisive victory over the Lib Dems, saying the \u00a32.7bn savings to pay for the pensions increase from abolishing the Department of Trade and Industry in fact represented scrapping two-thirds of the state support for science and cutting all of its regional assistance. </p> <p>Michael Howard, meanwhile, rhetorically wondered who \"could possibly have been responsible\" for the three months of \"poison and briefing\" that friends of the resigned pensions secretary Andrew Smith has complained of.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a thousand pensioners are were lobbying MPs outside parliament over Britain's provision for the elderly, the NPC was launching its manifesto for pensioners' rights and the Pensioners' Voice organisation was holding its 65th annual conference in Weston-super-Mare.</p> <p>With Mr Blair still weighing up who will receive the vital pensions portfolio, Rodney Bickerstaffe, the NPC president - and former general secretary of the public sector union Unison - called on the prime minister to ensure that whoever got the job would abolish means-testing for pensioners.</p> <p>As his organisation prepared to lobby MPs at Westminster, he told Guardian Unlimited: \"Means-testing is unfair and unnecessary in the fourth richest economy in the world. I want to know who in government is driving the means-testing agenda.\"</p> <p>Asked who he would like to see as the new work and pensions secretary, he joked: \"Whoever agrees with me the most!\" However, he said the NPC could take some credit for forcing the pensions issue, with both the Lib Dems and, to a lesser extent, the Tories now committed to restoring the pensions' rise link with average earnings.</p> <p>He said: \"The Tories have pledged to maintain the link for at least four years - and the Lib Dems yesterday met the NPC's demand for a \u00a3100-a-week basic state pension - because of public concern at the pensions crisis and pension income and future income. </p> <p>\"We have forced everyone to think again.\"</p> <p><b>Power of the grey vote</b></p> <p>With up to 1,500 of the NPC's 1.3m members in Parliament Square today Mr Bickerstaffe, who refused a knighthood from the Labour government, claimed that gathering 5,000 to 6,000 pensioners \"would not have been a problem\" but said today's lobby was about speaking to MPs individually, not numbers.</p> <p>The event is part of a year-long campaign being organised by the NPC to wield the power of the \"grey vote\" in the run-up to a general election, and the creation of a pensioners' manifesto.</p> <p> It hopes to lobby between 100 and 200 MPs today to gain their support for the manifesto, and plans to speak to every candidate standing in the general election, which is widely expected to take place next year. </p> <p>Candidates' responses to the manifesto will be published by groups in their constituency to help pensioners there decide how to cast their vote. Proposals in the NPC manifesto include: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Raising the basic state pension to the guaranteed level of the pension credit of \u00a3105.45 a week for all pensioners and increasing it in line with average earnings each year</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Giving all people of pensionable age a free annual health check</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Introducing good quality and affordable home care services to enable people to remain in their own homes for longer</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> All long-term care and accommodation to be provided free</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Council tax to be abolished and replaced with a fairer system based on government grants and increased localised business rates and income tax </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The introduction of a nationwide travel scheme enabling pensioners and disabled people to use all buses, coaches, trains, ferries and tubes free of charge </p> <p>Although many, if not all, of those demands closely mirror new Lib Dem policy, Mr Bickerstaffe reiterated that the NPC was non-partisan and pointed out that the question was \"who was in power\".</p> <p>\"The manifesto could chime with the Socialist Workers party or the Socialist Alliance too, but it needs to be implemented,\" he said.</p> <p><b>Current entitlements</b></p> <p>Speaking ahead of the lobby today, the pensions minister Malcolm Wicks defended Labour policy on pensions. </p> <p>He told GMTV the guaranteed pension level was \u00a3105 for a single pensioner and more for a couple with people also possibly eligible for help with rent and council tax. </p> <p>He said: \"If people have not got that second pension, the occupational pension, or the savings, they are guaranteed that \u00a3105. </p> <p>\"The difficulty here ... is do you use the extra money that you are spending - and this Labour government is spending \u00a310bn each and every year more than we were when we came to power in 1997 - by spreading it relatively thinly so all pensioners gain or do you try to focus extra help on the poorest who tend to be the most elderly?\" </p> <p>He insisted it was fair to help the poorest pensioners. </p> <p><b>Pensioner conference</b></p> <p>Meanwhile, away from Westminster, delegates from across the country will meet in Weston-super-Mare for the annual conference of the pressure group Pensioners' Voice today. </p> <p>Topics for debate will be private pension rights, proposed increases to council tax, and MRSA \"superbug\" in hospitals. </p> <p>Pensioners' Voice national vice-president Charles Connell said: \"For 65 years this federation, with branches spread from Dover to Plymouth, Bristol to Darlington and from south Wales to Glasgow has fought on behalf of pensioners and their rights. </p> <p>\"Still, the most important promise that pensioners should share in the rising prosperity of the nation is being glossed over. </p> <p>\"All that New Labour offers pensioners is the outrageously complicated means-tested pension credit. </p> <p>\"Private pensions are in crisis, council tax bills soar and now we are hearing of rising power and water bills. </p> <p>\"Pensioners are bullied into giving up their pension books and have little confidence in the computerised system that is now replacing them.\" </p> <p>Delegates at the conference will hear 14 motions relating to pensioners' rights including the low take up of means-tested benefits and the closure of post offices.</p>",
  "Iran has tentatively agreed to freeze some of its sensitive nuclear activities, diplomats said today. The news comes as the country attempts to head off US efforts to report its nuclear programme to the UN security council. <p>Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Hassan Rohani, admitted he had been in talks with European officials over its nuclear capabilities. </p> <p>Diplomats told both Reuters and the Associated Press that Iran had agreed, in principle, to halt the production, testing and assembly of centrifuges used to enrich uranium. The US has claimed Iran planned to use the centrifuges to produce weapons-grade material - a charge Tehran has denied. </p> <p>Washington, however, would like to see Iran's case referred to the security council for possible sanctions. EU countries - particularly France, Germany and the UK - have preferred using diplomatic negotiations to convince Iran to freeze its enrichment activities. </p> <p>Iran wants to see its case at the International Atomic Energy Organisation closed. The IAEA, which in June passed a resolution criticising Iran for failing to cooperate with UN inspectors, is due to make a decision when its board meets on September 13. </p> <p>\"If the IAEA reports Iran's case to the security council, it will obviously be a politically-motivated decision ... there are no technical and legal reasons for Iran's case to be reported to the council,\" Mr Rohani said.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, yesterday said the world had \"seen enough\" of Iran's nuclear ambitions to warrant punitive action. </p> <p>Uranium enriched to high levels can be used to make nuclear warheads, but can generate power at lower levels. Iran claimed it was only interested in power generation. </p> <p>Despite the potential agreement on freezing centrifuge production, Mr Rohani said Iran would retain control over the entire nuclear fuel cycle, from mining uranium to enrichment. \"Iran considers controlling the nuclear fuel cycle its legitimate and basic right. The fuel cycle has to remain within the Islamic Republic's access,\" he said. </p> <p>Iran last year agreed to suspend uranium enrichment under international pressure, and says it still remains committed to its pledge. </p> <p>However, Tehran resumed testing, assembling and making centrifuges earlier this year after it said Europeans had failed to fulfil a promise to close the country's nuclear case at the IAEA meeting in June. </p> <p>\"Whenever Iran gets practically close to enrichment issues, the sensitivity of the Europeans rises, and whenever we practically distance ourselves from enrichment, their tone changes and you see a smile on their faces,\" Mr Rowhani said, referring to the recent talks.</p>",
  "<p>Students today labelled Tory plans to charge commercial rates on loans \"abhorrent\", as university bosses gave them a cautious welcome.</p> <p>The president of the National Union of Students (NUS), Kat Fletcher, expressed \"grave concerns\" over the plans, which would see tuition fees dropped and replaced with a commercial rate of interest on student loans of up to 8%. She immediately sought to distance the union from the Conservative party after sharing an uneasy alliance since it announced it would abolish fees. </p> <p>\"Though the Tories stood by the NUS in our battle over tuition fees, we now recognise that their promises for a fairer funding situation for higher education were merely rhetoric. It is naive for the Tories to believe that this will win the student vote in the run-up to the general election. </p> <p>\"Such proposals will only serve to burden those already severely in debt with more debt over a period of time, marking a regressive response to the funding crisis in higher education.\"</p> <p>However, Universities UK (UUK), which represents university vice-chancellors, said the plan recognised its concerns over getting more money into universities. UUK has vigorously supported the government's plans for top-up fees.</p> <p>Its president, Ivor Crewe, said members had been consulted over the plans. \"We look forward to discussing the detail with the Conservative team, particularly with regard to the voucher scheme. One of our top priorities will be to ensure a commitment to maintaining the unit of funding per student.\"</p> <p>The fully-costed details of the plans are expected to emerge later today, but speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning the shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, claimed the plans would raise as much money for the universities as the government's plans for top-up fees, but students would be better off. </p> <p>At present, all students are able to take out student loans of up to \u00a33,695. They start repaying once they earn more than \u00a310,000 at the rate of 9p on every pound earned above this threshold - plus an inflation-only interest rate. </p> <p>Under the proposals being released today students would be charged 2% above the bank base rate to a maximum of 8%. The plans would help dissuade students from taking out expensive credit cards, Mr Collins said. </p> <p>Universities, rather than the treasury and the government-owned student loans company, would control the loans and would be able to borrow against future earnings to raise money now. And they would honour the government's plans to introduce a \u00a31,500 grant for the least well off from September 2006.</p> <p>Professor Nicholas Barr, the original architect of the government's top-up fees plans, said: \"The Conservative proposals unambiguously help students from better-off backgrounds (who no longer have to pay fees) and harm students from poorer backgrounds, who will be hurt by the higher interest rate.</p> <p>\"This policy direction is problematical in two ways: it is deeply regressive, benefiting merchant bankers at the expense of nurses and teachers; and, by impeding access, it risks losing the talent of bright people from poorer backgrounds. It is good policy if the aim is to curry favour with the middle classes, but has no other redeeming features.</p> <p>Phil Willis the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, said: \"Michael Howard is now showing his true colours. Under his plans only the wealthy should apply to universities. </p> <p>\"Tory policies will see poorer students being priced out of universities by huge hikes in the cost of student loans. </p> <p>\"By introducing commercial interest rates poorer students will end up with astronomic levels of debt and many will be put off going to university all together.\"</p>",
  "<p>Danielle Hall looks little different from many other 16-year-olds, but the buggy she is pushing means she qualifies for special treatment from strangers. As she walks along the street, filthy looks and nasty comments are directed at her and her three-week-old daughter. She puts her head down and keeps walking. \"I pretend to them I don't care, but I just feel like running away and crying,\" she says. \"They don't know anything about me, but they still think I'm a slag who doesn't care about her baby.\"</p> <p>Danielle is not alone. According to charity YWCA England &amp; Wales, many young mothers face appalling prejudice that prevents them from accessing vital support services and limits their chances of re-entering education and employment. Branded as council flat queue jumpers or scroungers, they are still demonised, stereotyped and written off as burdens on society.</p> <p>Though never exactly popular, attitudes towards them took a turn for the worse in the 1980s, says YWCA, when teenage mothers became a hot political issue and parts of the media became even more openly hostile. It believes that, despite some positive government initiatives aimed at training and learning opportunities, those prejudices are still widely held.</p> <p>\"Our government, politicians and media sanction discrimination and disadvantage through perpetuating the belief that teenage mothers are at best ignorant and at worst irresponsible and incapable of being good parents,\" says Sally Copley, director of policy, research and campaigns at YWCA.</p> <p>YWCA's Respect Young Mums campaign, launched today, wants people - and especially public service employees, including those in the caring professions - to question their attitudes towards teenage mothers and to recognise that every young woman should have the right to make choices about her own life, including pregnancy and motherhood.</p> <p>The charity wants more specialist health and social welfare services geared towards young mothers, and equal benefits for mothers under 18. It also wants teenage pregnancy strategies to put more emphasis on supporting teenage mothers, as well as reducing conception rates.</p> <p>It is prepared for the inevitable criticism that, by promoting the rights of teenage girls to decide they want a baby, YWCA is saying it is acceptable to get pregnant so young. \"We're not here to pass judgment on these young women,\" Copley says. \"Teenage mothers, regardless of their background, should be treated as people, not social problems. Root causes - such as social exclusion, poor sex education and lack of educational and vocational opportunities - need to be confronted, not the young mothers themselves.\"</p> <p>That is a tough call in a social climate where teenage mothers are still presented as evidence of a decline in moral values. A YWCA survey reveals that the traditional stereotypes about teenage mothers remain. Nearly half of respondents believed that teenagers got pregnant to gain access to housing; 60% thought promiscuous behaviour was a major cause of teenage pregnancy.</p> <p>\"These attitudes are frustrating because most young women have no idea about housing or social security policy before they get pregnant,\" Copley says. \"Research proves that half of mothers aged 16-17 still live in the parental home.\"</p> <p>Negative stereotyping also pervades the workplace. Caroline Atkinson, a midwife at the Young People's Maternity Practice in Doncaster, south Yorkshire, says many health professionals are failing to give young mothers the right support. \"I've seen many health professionals struggle to care for teenage mothers because they question their motivations,\" she says, \"The expectation of moral judgment can lead young mothers to be aggressive or confrontational, so communication is often difficult. The danger is that this leads to young women failing to seek the right advice and help.</p> <p>\"We have to realise that just because someone is a young mother doesn't mean that she's a bad mother. These young women need support, understanding and equal treatment to ensure they can build positive futures for themselves and their families.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>More on YWCA's teenage mothers campaign at: <a href=\"http://www.ywca.org.uk/youngmums\">www.ywca.org.uk/youngmums</a>.</p> <p><strong>Jo Benson, 17, has a seven-month old daughter, Caitlin, and lives at home with her family.</strong></p> <p>\"I got pregnant by mistake, but I was really happy because I loved my boyfriend. Then he said the baby wasn't his, even though he's the only person I've ever slept with. His mum hates me. She says I'm irresponsible, but every single thing I do is for Caitlin.</p> <p>It's irresponsible of people to judge me. How do they know whether I'm a good mother or not? My mum had me when she was 17 and she got treated like this, so nothing has changed.</p> <p>I hated hospital. They put me in a room on my own because they said I wouldn't be able to cope with my baby, but I wanted to be in with other mothers so I could learn from them.</p> <p>I didn't know what to do at the birth and no one advised me. I said I'd try to breastfeed Caitlin, but she wouldn't latch on. I asked the midwife for help and she just grabbed my breast and squeezed it really hard. I had finger bruises afterwards. There's no way she'd do that to an older mother.</p> <p>After I had the baby, I bled a lot and when I stood up all the blood poured on to the floor and I was told: 'When you come back from the toilet you can clean that up.'</p> <p>In the end, I just went home and worked it out for myself. Now I don't trust health visitors because I think they'll act like the midwives. I'm not going to be treated like that again.</p> <p>People always presume I'm a bad mother, but if they're really that bothered then why don't they help me? A woman at income support said: 'You got yourself pregnant, now you can sort yourself out.'

I'd been with my boyfriend since I was 12 and it was a mistake - the condom split, and that was that.</p> <p>At first, I was absolutely gutted. My mum had me at 17 and I knew how tough it had been on her. But my boyfriend was brilliant and has been really supportive. I was really worried that I would never have a career, but my mum said: 'Look at me, I had kids when I was young and now I've got a job and a life and I'm still young enough to go out and enjoy it.'</p> <p>It's difficult when you read in the papers about teenage mothers because they make out that it's a big scam to get out of having to get a job.

Nobody wants to give you any opportunities.</p> <p>Abortion never crossed my mind because as soon as I got my head around the fact that I was pregnant I loved my baby already. The pregnancy was tough, but the midwives wouldn't believe me when I said I was in pain. They gave me a scan a couple of days later and then I had to have an emergency Caesarean.</p> <p>When I got home it was difficult getting used to people's reactions. They would ask me how old my brother was and tut at me in the street. It made me feel like I'd done something wrong. But I'm in a long-term relationship, I have prospects and the support of my family, so the only problem is they think I'm five years too young to have children.</p> <p>Even so, I wouldn't wish being a young mum on anyone.

  "<p>Mental health campaigners today condemned government proposals to detain people with untreatable mental disorders for care which would not alleviate their symptoms.</p> <p>A revised draft mental health bill, published today, would enable psychiatrists to force people with severe personality disorders to undergo \"clinically appropriate\" care which would not need to improve their mental condition.</p> <p>Tony Zigmond, vice-president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, warned that the plan risked \"fundamentally undermining standards of mental healthcare\".</p> <p>He said that while detaining such patients might control their behaviour it would \"probably do them no good, and would probably damage them\".</p> <p>Dr Zigmond said: \"If you're talking about controlling their behaviour it probably does that. Does it do them any good? No.\"</p> <p>The government's mental health tsar, Professor Louis Appleby, claimed that the proposal was far less draconian than the original draft bill, published two years ago, which would have allowed people with severe mental disorders to be detained without a care plan. </p> <p>Under current laws, psychiatrists can only order the compulsory treatment or detention of people with personality disorders if they believe they can provide treatment to relieve their symptoms - referred to as the \"treatability test\". </p> <p>Prof Appleby said the revisions to the draft bill would ensure that where doctors did not accept that appropriate clinical care could be provided they would be under no obligation to detain patients. </p> <p>The bill would also mean patients could be subject to compulsory treatment in the community, focusing on so-called \"revolving door\" patients who leave hospital only to return when they fail to take their medication. Ministers claim this measure has been revised so that patients would first need to be assessed in hospital.</p> <p>But Dr Zigmond said the wording of the proposed legislation suggested that someone could be forcibly treated in the community on the basis of an assessment carried out in hospital 20 years ago.</p> <p>The bill also sets clear criteria on when someone could be detained against their will. This would only apply when doctors decided patients were at serious risk of committing suicide or risking their own safety through neglect, or other people would be at risk of harm. </p> <p>The mental health minister, Rosie Winterton, said the draft bill put a new focus on the individual, \"allowing compulsory powers to be used in ways that fit with patients' changing needs\". </p> <p>She said: \"People will only be subject to treatment under the bill if they are at risk of harm to themselves or others. </p> <p>\"The bill means that the small minority of people with mental health problems who need to be treated against their wishes, normally for their own protection but occasionally to protect the public, will get the right treatment at the right time.\"</p> <p>The first draft of the bill prompted widespread criticism from campaigners that the human rights of those with mental illness would be damaged by the broad criteria used to decide who should be detained. </p> <p>But mental health campaigners expressed disappointment that the definition still includes people with drug and alcohol problems as well as \"sexual deviants\", whom they believe would be better dealt with outside of the mental health system.</p> <p>Campaigning organisation the Mental Health Alliance said the bill risked bringing mental health services to their knees as hundreds more people were brought under compulsory powers. </p> <p>Its chairman, Paul Farmer, said the alliance members were \"deeply disappointed\" that the government had still not listened to the concerns of professionals, carers and people using services. </p> <p>He said: \"The most worrying of all is that the government's way of defining who qualifies for treatment against their will is far too broad.

  "<p>When two penniless environmental activists, David Morris and Helen Steel, were sued for libel by the fast-food giant McDonald's, the 313-day trial turned into the longest court case in English legal history. </p> <p>Yesterday, seven years after the action ended in 1997, they took their case to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg to argue that English libel law and the lack of legal aid for defamation cases - which forced them to represent themselves against a global corporation - denied them the right to free speech and a fair hearing. </p> <p>This time, though, their case, brought against the UK government for breaching the European convention on human rights, was over in little more than two hours, though they will have to wait several months for judgment. For this battle, they had legal aid from the Strasbourg court and a lawyer to put their case. </p> <p>Keir Starmer QC, representing the McLibel Two, told the Strasbourg judges: \"This case is about the rights of two ordinary people without power or wealth to engage in a public campaign on matters of public interest and importance.\" </p> <p>He said English libel law breached the human rights convention because of the stark inequality between ordinary individuals and a massive corporation. </p> <p>McDonald's employed the most expensive lawyers and deployed all the resources of a multinational, while Ms Steel and Mr Morris struggled to argue their case without legal aid or the money to buy the legal expertise they required. </p> <p>Ms Steel, 39, and Mr Morris, 50, were sued by McDonald's for handing out leaflets, which they did not write, titled: \"What's wrong with Mc-Donald's?\" </p> <p>The high court in London ruled that McDonald's had been libelled, and awarded the company \u00a360,000 in damages, later reduced to \u00a340,000 on appeal, which was never paid. </p> <p>The case turned into an expensive public relations disaster for McDonald's when the judge also ruled that the leaflet had correctly accused the corporation of paying low wages, being responsible for cruelty to some of the animals used in its products and exploiting children in advertising campaigns. </p> <p>Mr Starmer told the Strasbourg judges that English defamation law was heavily weighted against the defendants, who had to establish the truth of every statement in the leaflet. This differed from libel law elsewhere. </p> <p>The inequality between the opponents \"could not have been starker\", he said. When the McLibel trial began in 1994, global McDonald's sales were valued at about $18.75bn (\u00a310bn), rising to about $30bn (\u00a316bn) by the end of 1995. </p> <p>\"By way of contrast, during the same period, Ms Steel's maximum income was \u00a365 a week when she was employed as a part-time bar worker, and Mr Morris, a single parent, was unwaged and entirely dependent on income support. The result was that, without legal assistance, the case was under-prepared, unready for trial and was advanced by two inexperienced, untrained and exhausted individuals who were pushed to their physical and mental limits. In short, it was patently unfair.\" </p> <p>Mr Starmer said that to require strict proof of anything contained in social campaign literature \"strikes at the very heart of pluralism, which is the hallmark of democracy\". </p> <p>Philip Sales, for the government, told the judges that the fact that the pair lost their libel battle was not evidence that they had been let down by English libel law or by rules on assistance and access to justice. \"They were given every possible latitude in the presentation of their case.\" he said. \"Indeed, the trial judge went out of his way to a quite extraordinary degree.\" </p> <p>He said campaigning organisations should not be permitted to engage in \"one-sided campaigns of vilification\" beyond the limits of the libel laws which applied to others. </p> <p>Afterwards Mr Morris said he was satisfied with the hearing, claiming the government had been forced to acknowledge that legal aid could be made available for libel cases in exceptional circumstances.</p>",

  "<p>The Conservative party will today promise to stick to its plans to abolish top-up fees but make students pay commercial rates of interest on their student loans, should they win the next general election.</p> <p>The fully-costed details of the plans are expected later, but speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning the shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, claimed the plans would raise as much money for the universities as the government's plans for top-up fees, but leave students better off.</p> <p>The higher education minister, Alan Johnson, however, called the plans \"massively unfair\", while the Liberal Democrats' Phil Willis said they would see \"poorer students being priced out of university\".</p> <p>Under the plans, from the September after the Tories won a general election students would not have to pay any university fees but instead a commercial rate of interest on their student maintenance loans.</p> <p>At present, all students are able to take out student loans of up to \u00a33,695. They start repaying once they earn more than \u00a310,000 at the rate of 9p on every pound earned above this threshold - plus an inflation-only interest rate. </p> <p>Under the proposals being released today students would be charged 2% above the bank base rate, to a maximum of 8%. The plans would help dissuade students from taking out expensive credit cards, Mr Collins said.</p> <p>Universities, rather than the Treasury and the government-owned student loans company, would control the loans and would be able to borrow against future earnings to raise money now.</p> <p>The Tories would also honour the government's plans to introduce a \u00a31,500 grant for the least well-off from September 2006, but all other students would be treated the same, with the abolition of means-testing.</p> <p>Mr Collins said the plans would leave the public purse better-off as the subsidy for the interest free loans, and the payment of tuition fees for the least wealthy, would be lifted.</p> <p>Universities would get more money than under the government's plans, he said: \"Not only do they get the same amount as the government plans but very substantial new sums. Up to \u00a33bn over the first three years. And \u00a320bn over 20 years.\"</p> <p>And students would benefit considerably too, he claimed. The average debt would be \u00a310,000 - compared with an expected average of \u00a319,000 once top-up fees are introduced.</p> <p>He defended the plans to introduce commercial levels of debts, saying they would still be lower than some of the rates students pay on credit cards. \"Many students have additional debts which they often take out at much higher rates of interest. Overall, students will be considerably better-off under our plans compared with the government's.\"</p> <p>Asked whether people who opted for lower-paying jobs in the public sector would pay back more as it takes them longer and they accrue more interest on their loans, he said: \"It's not true that someone who works in a public sector job will be worse off. NHS clinical researchers take 19 years to repay their debt; under our plans they pay it off earlier and save money.\"</p> <p>However, Mr Johnson, the higher education minister tipped for promotion to the cabinet in this week's reshuffle, condemned the Tory plans as \"massively unfair\".</p> <p>\"They would mean that repayment of student loans would not be based in any way on the ability to pay,\" he said. \"Repayment would not be through the tax system and so would be massively unfair and expensive for the universities to administer. </p> <p>\"And, most importantly of all, universities would simply not get the money they need for raising the quality of their courses.\" </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' education spokesman, Mr Willis, also criticised the Tory proposals, saying they would see \"poorer students being priced out of universities\".</p> <p>\"By introducing commercial interest rates poor students will end up with astronomic levels of debt and many will be put off going to university altogether,\" he added.</p> <p>Further details were expected to emerge with the full publication of the plans later today.</p> <p>A year and a half ago the Conservatives made the surprise announcement that they planned to abolish fees, but they have has since been reviewing the policy in an admission that their first version of the plans would leave universities short of cash.</p> <p>EducationGuardian.co.uk first confirmed the Tory plans to up the rates of interest on student loans last month. The plan was defended then by Paul Bristow, the chairman of young Tories' group Conservative Future. \"I think students will be delighted by this,\" he said. \"This is the best possible deal students will get. They pay loans back in the end but the crippling up-front fee is not there [in the Tory policy] any longer.\" </p> <p>However, the National Union of Students condemned the plans. The vice-president of the NUS, Hannah Essex, said: \"Any increase in the interest rate of student loan repayments would prolong the lifespan of debt and punish those who need to take out the maximum loan, which is often students from low-income backgrounds.\"</p>",

  "<p>The former Pentagon policy adviser Richard Perle today moved to distance himself from the disgraced former Telegraph owner Conrad Black and the \u00a3220m alleged looting scandal that has engulfed the Hollinger firm where he was a director.</p> <p>Mr Perle, who sat on the board along with other well-connected US figures including Henry Kissinger, issued a statement last night declaring he had been misled by management into approving controversial deals.</p> <p>Lord Black was last week criticised for using Hollinger's finances as a personal \"piggybank\" and accused of \"corporate kleptocracy\" involving everything from charging personal expenses such as flights, apartments and lavish party bills to signing away millions on management fees for himself and other executives.</p> <p>Mr Perle hit out at claims in the report by fellow directors at Hollinger International - which until July owned the Daily Telegraph - that he breached his fiduciary duties to shareholders. </p> <p>He said he \"cannot agree with the committee's unwarranted and unsubstantiated suggestion\" that in his capacity as an official with Hollinger's online division he put his own interests ahead of the company and its shareholders. </p> <p>\"In approving some transactions that came to me as a member of the executive committee, I had a right to rely, and did rely, on the information provided to me by Hollinger's management, including its general counsel,\" Mr Perle said. </p> <p>\"I had no reason to believe that they were failing to disclose information necessary for the making of informed judgments.\" </p> <p>The report, written by a special committee of Hollinger directors with Richard Breeden, the former chairman of the US securities and exchange commission, accused Mr Perle of enriching himself at the expense of the company.</p> <p>As the former chairman and chief executive of Hollinger Digital, which launched websites including price comparison service Shopping.com, Mr Perle received \u00a31.8m in bonuses on top of his salary. </p> <p>He was accused of breaching his fiduciary duties by signing unanimous consents without reading the documents; several apparently authorised the controversial transactions.

  "<p><strong> March 18 2004 </strong><br> </p> <p> One of the unsettling things about cellular living is that the jail authorities can randomly uproot an inmate at any time and transplant him into a new environment. During my two-year stay at the jail, I have been rolled-up (moved) several times. A new cell equals a new garrison of cockroaches to battle and I have learned to travel armed with AmerFresh Fluoride toothpaste, which blocks cockroach entry points very effectively. </p> <p>On Tuesday our whole pod was moved to a different floor and I used my entire stock of AmerFresh to seal the numerous cockroach-launching points. The new cell was quickly and expertly fortified against the enemy. That night I slept soundly. Little did I know that the jail was about to sabotage my hard work. </p> <p>On Wednesday I was moved back to my original floor and into one of the most cockroach-infested pods in the building. I was completely unarmed and helplessly watched the insects size me up from myriad cracks in the walls. The lights were still on, but I knew that by night time I would be doomed. My new cellmate and I didn't get much sleep, but lay awake watching the legions of cockroaches conquer the room. Whirling around us, they swarmed the floor, the walls, the ceiling, our commissary bags and, finally, our bunks. </p> <p><strong> March 25 </strong><br> </p> <p>I am allowed out of my cell for one hour each day to make a phone call and to take a shower. During my first \"hour out\" in the new pod, I was serenaded by the inmates, who performed a husky version of Yellow Submarine. I was touched by their vocal efforts and their demonstration of high spirits. </p> <p>My new co-habitants are enduring the twin evils of a broken swamp-cooler and a cockroach infestation. They are proving to be the creme de la creme of good sufferers. A neighbouring asthmatic inmate happily described how he inhaled a cockroach that had crept into his nebuliser. He could feel the insect crawling around inside him and promptly vomited his stomach contents. Unfortunately the cockroach was not ejected, as it was lodged in his lung. He was subsequently awarded \"sufferer of the week\" without any real competition. (\"Sufferer of the week\" was an idea of mine that has delighted and distracted my fellow inmates. The title is given to the inmate whom the rest of the pod feel has suffered most.) </p> <p>My cellmate and I have used six tubes of AmerFresh toothpaste and six ounces of Razorless Beard Remover cementing cracks in the walls. The cockroaches still flood our cell every night and I have awoken several times this week to observe my body hair stood up on end and a cockroach crawling on my person. I had previously considered my ape-like fur coating as one of nature's cruel jokes, but now I have discovered that it is a useful defensive shield. </p> <p><strong> April Fool's day </strong><br> </p> <p> My cellmate Mark is stuck at the \"unable-to-eat-the-jail-food\" stage. Approximately three months ago, Mark suffered his first ever arrest, and he has shed 30lbs while in the hoosegow [jail]. His main source of sustenance is the inmate canteen order form, from which he mostly orders Cheez-its, chips (assorted), Granola bars and mixed nuts. Slimmed-down-Mark no longer resembles his booking photo, because he barely touches the jail offerings. </p> <p>Prison inmates who get transferred to the jail joke about how luxurious prison food is vis-a-vis jail meals. (Jail is where unsentenced prisoners are housed and prison is where you go when you are sentenced.) In jail, chow is served twice each day. Breakfast arrives at 8.30am and consists of six slices of stale white bread (the probability of colourful mould growing on a slice is 33%), raw breakfast meat (the probability of it being bologna is 50%, green bologna is 25%), grapefruits or oranges collected during neighbourhood refuse clean-up campaigns (the probability of them being rotten is 50%), one packet of stale and bright orange-coloured, bordering on luminous, cheese crackers, and a beverage, which is a half-pint of fat-free milk. </p> <p>The evening's below-lukewarm culinary delights consist of unsalted boiled potatoes (the probability of receiving a mound of potato peel encrusted with dirt is 25%; of human hair being discovered in the spuds is 25%), mystery meat slop (the probability of a dead rat in the stew is minimal, though I did see a rat's head served in 2002), a vegetable (the probability of leathery eggplant is 25%), a small, undressed salad, more stale bread and a cup of brightly coloured juice, which, if spilled, makes a permanent stain on the table. As I am a yoga-practising vegetarian, I receive peanut butter and veggie burgers as substitutes for the meat. </p> <p><strong> April 15 </strong><br> </p> <p>I received lots of eggs on Easter Sunday: cockroach eggs. I noticed something that looked like a piece of a worm glued to my dictionary. It was full of cockroach larvae. I discovered two more empty egg containers nearby. More nests were discovered in my legal file, and my commissary bag. I poured the contents of one envelope into the toilet, but in the time it took to press the flush button, las cucarachas had scurried out of the toilet bowl and were scrambling around my feet. </p> <p>They were none too happy about their encampment being besieged on a Holy Day, and as darkness came they began to rebel en masse. Numerous baby cockroaches, tinier than ants, started a demonstration. They zigzagged on every wall like minuscule bumper cars. They were soon joined by adult members of their community. One about the size of an almond crawled on to my foot. Several larger ones appeared on the blanket near my right shoulder, and I had to sleep with a sheet wrapped around my head because I feared they had performed a reconnaissance of my upper-body orifices. </p> <p>Mark (my celly) was very disturbed. He stayed awake for most of the night, but when his eyelids finally closed, he dreamed that they were crawling all over him and woke in a terrible sweat, scratching at his body, only to discover that his dream had come true. </p> <p>The law clearly states that \"pre-sentence detainees\" have the right not to live in an insect-infested environment, but the jail continuously flouts the law by showing the external referees their insecticide-spraying records. In fact, the insecticide is sprayed on the inmates and the only effect it has upon the roaches is as a temporary intoxicant. On spray day they act like drunkards stumbling home from the pub, but they quickly sober up. </p> <p>I placed a whole green onion from my dinner tray into a polystyrene cup. I half-filled it with water and, to my delight, it started to grow roots. Now I have a plant of my very own to love and care for! I haven't seen a plant for years! Mark is starting to suspect I've been here too long. </p> <p><strong> April 22 </strong><br> </p> <p>I am a bibliomaniac! I have read 29 books in the last three months, some of which were more than 1,000 pages long. I read for up to 12 hours every day. There are two difficulties associated with being a jailhouse bookworm. The first is bleeding bedsores - I currently have one on my left buttock - and the second is dealing with the mailroom. </p> <p>My first run-in with the mailroom occurred last year when they rejected Security Analysis, a hardback book containing more than 1,000 pages. The mail rejection notification stated that the book was not a book, but actually a \"weapon\". Then last autumn I was denied some Karl Marx. The mail rejection notification stated that I was \"jeopardising the safety of the jail operation\". This past week, I was denied three books that were ordered from <a href=\"http://www.traderspress.com\">www.traderspress.com</a>. The mail rejection notification stated that \"books must be delivered directly from the publisher or online dist [sic]\". As traderspress.com is both a publisher and online distributor, I lodged a complaint, using an inmate grievance form. I was visited by a friendly hearing officer who stated that the mail room officer had made an error and that the jail would accept redelivery. I reordered the books at the cost of an additional redelivery fee and I thought that would be the end of the matter. Unfortunately, the mail room officer had been offended by my complaint and I received a retaliatory, threatening note taped to my Wall St Journal. The note stated: \"You need to contact the Wall St Journal and advise them of your new facility/bunk no. All papers from now on will be thrown away . . . Mail Officer.\" </p> <p>Upon analysing these notices, I have concluded that the mailroom has determined that I am a weapon-seeking revolutionary. The threat to throw away my newspapers seems to be a call to arms. </p> <p><strong> May 13 </strong><br> </p> <p>Frankie, an alleged Mexican mafia contract killer, is the source of most of the hullabaloo in our pod. Last month Frankie was calmly playing cards in a maximum-security pod when an eight-inch shank was suddenly plunged into the back of his neck. Unfazed, he extracted the shank, and was about to return the gesture, when guards pepper-sprayed him, causing temporary blindness. He was consequently promoted to our pod - a super-maximum area, where inmates are confined to tiny two-man cells for 23 hours every day. </p> <p>Frankie looks and acts like Joe Pesci in a mobster movie. He wears his thick, black hair slicked back, and his arms are heavily prison-tattooed. He overcompensates for his Napoleonic height with a cocksure manner, but the inmates have warmed to his lewd wittiness. He has previously served a 17-year sentence, and during that time he became a chess heavyweight. During my one hour out, I usually play a game of chess with him, through his cell window. His piercing hazel eyes and fiendish grin animate his attempts at psychological warfare . . . </p> <p>\"Eat dat fuckin' pawn!\" </p> <p>\"Let me fuckin' teach yer somethin'!\" </p> <p>\"Eat dat fuckin' bishop!\" </p> <p>\"Watch dis! Check! Trick move! What'd fuckin' tell ya!\" </p> <p>\"Don't do it!\" </p> <p>\"Move my bitch (queen) all da way up!\" </p> <p>\"Check-fuckin'-mate! Boo yah!!\" </p> <p>\"Nobody fucks wiv da champ!\" </p> <p>My green onion plant, which had sprouted six inches, suddenly wilted and died. </p> <p><strong> May 20 </strong><br> </p> <p>Hue and cry outside the jailhouse on Saturday morning - a public protest to bring attention to the jail's \"character-building\" conditions. The sheriff's [Maricopa county sheriff Joe Arpaio] swift response was to serve us with tasty mashed potatoes instead of the usual boiled potato peelings. On Sunday night we actually received a scoop of ice cream. Unfortunately, the ice cream was served on top of warm cabbage, causing it to metamorphose into cabbage soup. No matter, we appreciated the gesture, and we are still being served the delicious mashed potatoes. </p> <p>The daily temperatures are now in excess of 38C (100F) and rising. The air is stale and debilitating. On Monday an inmate told a guard that he felt ill and requested medical treatment. The guard told him to drink plenty of water and to lie down. The inmate persisted, stating that he was a diabetic and really needed to see the doctor, but the guard continued to fob him off. On Monday night the inmate slipped into a diabetic coma and was rushed to the hospital. He has not been seen since. </p> <p><strong> May 27 </strong><br> </p> <p>Two more inmates collapsed and were taken to the medical unit. Rumours abound that the diabetic who entered a coma last week may have died, and that the jail is under investigation. We have been told for the past three months that the swamp cooler is \"broken\" and that a \"work order\" has been entered, but, lo and behold, when the county health department inspected the jail on Tuesday and Wednesday, the air was miraculously blowing at gale force and our shower water was running hot enough to redden my skin. When the inspectors left the building someone immediately switched the air back to the \"broken\" setting. </p> <p>I received a large photograph in the mail. It exceeded the 4 x 6 inches allowed by the jail, so I was pleasantly surprised that it was not rejected by the trigger-happy mailroom. It was a picture of a bespectacled President Bush signing some important-looking documents. In the lower margin was a personalised message with my name on it. It read: \"Thank you for your support of the Republican National Committee. Grassroots leaders like you are the key to building a better, stronger, more secure future for our nation and all Americans . . . Best Wishes, George W Bush.\" </p> <p><strong> June 3 </strong><br> </p> <p>In this Hades, intravenous drug use is the hobby of the majority. Dozens of haunted men eagerly play Russian roulette by sharing one \"rig\" (syringe). Deadly diseases, including hepatitis C and TB, are common. The illegal drug use is only half of the story. Three times a day, a crotchety nurse goes from cell to cell dispensing \"meds\". Roughly one-third of the inmates are recipients of these pill cocktails. The most heavily pushed prescriptions are for Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Prozac, Paxil, Haldol, Elavil and Seroquel. </p> <p>The inmates snigger at how easy it is to obtain free drugs. They simply tell the psych doctor that they are \"hearing voices\" or are \"unable to sleep\". The jail's Big Kahuna [Arpaio] regularly appears on TV boasting that it costs the taxpayer a pittance to feed society's refuse, but he never mentions the millions of dollars being spent on expensive \"meds\", which the drug companies are profiting from handsomely. </p> <p>It's been an infernally \"normal week\". Outdoor temperatures are approaching 110F, and we are slowly being brought to the boil. Mark and I now catch one another chasing imaginary cockroaches. </p> <p>The dirty potato peelings are back as the main course among the diarrhoea-inducing expired eatables. Bone-dry citrus fruits are the new additions to breakfast. The stench of filth and sweat pervades the air. The bedsore on my left buttock is blistered and bleeding. My mouth and tongue are ulcerated. This joyless maltreatment is clearly designed to chafe one's happy-go-lucky disposition. The allure of being consigned to the grave can become an unremitting thought, as evidenced by the periodic suicides. </p> <p><strong> June 17 </strong><br> </p> <p> On Friday morning, the guards thwarted an escape attempt by two inmates. Despite the fact that they had botched the job, the jail administration decided to punish everyone. We were placed on \"Security Override\" for four consecutive days, during which we were confined to our cells, unable to shower, make phone calls or dispose of our trash and dinner trays. Soaring temperatures and a purposefully low trickle of swamp-cooled air quickly caused us to stink like wet dogs. </p> <p>Las cucarachas launched the most aggressive offensive that I have ever witnessed. I observed several divisions besiege our cell, consisting mostly of large, brown foot soldiers, a few white colonels, and one pregnant queen, carrying a dreaded baby capsule. </p> <p>The conditions have tipped Eric, a 50-year-old inmate, into a nervous breakdown. Early Monday morning, he started yelling, \"Get me outta here!!!\" repeatedly for 15 minutes. His voice inflection ranged from a demonically possessed adult male - worse than the Exorcist! - to that of a sobbing young child. </p> <p> <strong> June 24 </strong><br> </p> <p> My right shin looks like I have spilled battery acid on it. A skin infection formed last week when we were denied showers and a cluster of approximately 30 bright-red sores has appeared. Some of them are bleeding. </p> <p>Half of the shower area is refusing to drain. Hair matted with semen has clogged it up. To shower I have to step through the odoriferous scum floating in the water. This disturbs a multitude of tiny jet-black flies and they form a cloud around my person. Fortunately they bolt when the shower is turned on, and migrate to the dried fruit peel in the trashcan. When the shower is turned off they return to the shower. They prefer the semen. </p> <p><strong> July 2 </strong><br> </p> <p>Final entry. </p> <p>Periplaneta Americana, more commonly known as the American cockroach, has an average lifespan of 440 days. As of today, I have been a resident of this crowbar motel for almost two cockroach lifespans. I have endured sufficient suffering, and, following in the footsteps of most pre-sentence detainees, I have signed myself over to the prison industrial complex. Shortly, I will be shipped to a Department of Corrections processing facility, where they will decide which state penitentiary is to become my new abode. </p> <p><strong> July 13 </strong><br> </p> <p>I am still at the jail. A sudden spate of tragedies has occurred, compelling me to write this entry. At the weekend two inmates on my floor attempted to commit suicide. One threw himself off the balcony and survived. The other was discovered trying to hang himself. Sadder still, an inmate housed in a medium-security pod was found dead in the shower. Inmates are often \"smashed\" in the shower area because it is out of view of the cameras. The jail has refused to release the cause of his death. </p> <p>The temperature outside is currently 114F. The trickle of air into our cells feels like hot air blowing from a hair-dryer. We are soaked in sweat all day and night. It is difficult to write on this sweat-moistened paper. The majority now have skin infections and rashes, which persistently itch. My skin is so soggy from perspiration that when I scratch it the skin detaches and I end up with clumps of skin under my fingernails. Between the sweat trickling down my body and the cockroaches tickling my limbs, it is impossible to sleep properly. Last night, while sleeping on my side, my ear filled up with sweat, and when I moved my head, the sweat poured out on to my face. I woke up, startled. It felt like someone was touching my cheek. </p> <p>When I was a small child, I imagined that hell consisted of caves in which the damned were trapped, tortured and burned. I imagined serpents and indescribable creepy crawlies tormenting the captives. I never imagined that man's nature could be so hateful as to recreate these conditions on earth. </p> <p>In June, Shaun Attwood pleaded guilty. On July 16, he was moved to a secure processing centre, waiting to be moved to a prison where he will serve the remainder of his nine and a half year sentence. Conditions there are much better. </p> <p><a href=\"http://jonsjailjournal.blogspot.com\">http://jonsjailjournal.blogspot.com</a></p>",
  "Sir Mark Thatcher was today subpoenaed to appear before Cape Town magistrates to face questioning on the alleged Equatorial Guinea coup plot. <p>A request from the government of Equatorial Guinea to question the 51-year-old son of Lady Thatcher, the former British prime minister, over allegations that he funded a coup attempt in the oil-rich state was this week approved by the South African justice ministry.</p> <p>Foreign investigators were not permitted under South African law to interview Sir Mark directly, so Equatorial Guinea's questions will be put by a magistrate. The hearing has been set for September 22.</p> <p>Sir Mark is also expected in court on November 25 over charges that he violated South Africa's anti-mercenary laws. He denies all charges. </p> <p>Equatorial Guinea wants to question a number of Britons over allegations they funded a coup attempt.</p> <p>The alleged plotters were said to be hoping to exploit the country's vast oil reserves after overthrowing President Teodoro Obiang and installing their own leader, Severo Moto, who is currently in exile in Spain. </p> <p>Jose Olo Obono, Equatorial Guinea's chief prosecutor, told the Reuters news agency he may seek Sir Mark's extradition to stand trial alongside alleged foreign mercenaries, including Nick du Toit, a South African arms dealer. </p> <p>Simon Mann, a former SAS officer and friend of Sir Mark's in the upmarket Cape Town suburb of Constantia, was last month convicted by a court in Zimbabwe on weapons charges. Prosecutors are asking for a prison term of 10 years when he is sentenced on Friday.</p> <p>President Obiang has accused foreign nations and firms of seeking to remove him as the leader of sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil producer, a position he has held since he seized power in 1979.</p> <p>In all, 88 men are in custody in South Africa, Equatorial Guinea and Zimbabwe in connection with the alleged plan, said to have been foiled in March. </p> <p>Sir Mark could face up to 15 years in jail in South Africa if he is convicted of helping to fund the purchase of a helicopter. </p> <p>Equatorial Guinea has said it will not seek the death penalty for Sir Mark in the event that he is extradited and convicted of bankrolling the alleged coup.</p>",
  "<p>It's not often that the government does something that pleases the National Union of Students, but when it announced that it would be amending the housing bill (currently going through parliament) to include new measures to protect deposits paid by tenants to their landlords, the NUS was 'delighted'. </p> <p>Students are particularly at risk from unscrupulous landlords who, according to the NUS, seem to regard deposits paid against damage to a property 'as a windfall bonus', often refusing to pay the money back to former tenants, as they are legally required to do. </p> <p>For students who deal directly with their landlords (rather than using a letting agent), until the law changes, the only way of getting back an unfairly withheld deposit is by pursuing a claim in the small claims court which is hardly practical as, according to the NUS, it \"can be costly and is time consuming\".</p> <p>Tenants who use a letting agent must also use the small claims court to get their money back unless they took the precaution of finding a place to live through a regulated letting agent who also belongs to the Tenancy Deposit Scheme for Regulated Agents (TDSRA). This is a quicker independent dispute resolution scheme which went live on May 1 2004 and is free to tenants eligible to make use of it. However, the new scheme's major drawback is that not all letting agents belong to it - although you can find out whether one does by phoning 0845 226 7837 or going to <a href=\"http://www.tds.gb.com\">Tenancy Deposit Scheme</a>.</p> <p>But although having access to a dispute-resolution scheme is a good thing, \"the best way of protecting your deposit at the end of your tenancy\" says the NUS \"is to take precautions at the beginning\". So what can you do to avoid disputes arising in the first place?</p> <p>First of all, don't hand over any money until you have read, understood and are happy with the tenancy agreement. Then ensure all parties sign it before parting with any cash.</p> <p>Among other things, the tenancy agreement should state: \u00b7 How much you are expected to pay as a deposit - which is typically the equivalent or one month's rent but which can't be more than the equivalent of two months' rent if you are renting unfurnished accommodation, or three months' worth if the property is furnished.</p> <p>\u00b7 What the deposit is intended to cover. This can be rent (or bills) left unpaid at the end of the tenancy, for example, or the cost of professional cleaning if you fail to do this to a satisfactory standard, and/or the cost of repairing damage you have done to the property and/or its contents. </p> <p>\u00b7 When the deposit will be returned to you - which, for landlords who play fair - will typically be following an inspection of the property and confirmation that, give or take a bit of wear and tear, it is in the state you found it in and everything that is on the inventory (that should accompany the tenancy agreement) is still there or has been replaced. </p> <p>Don't sign the tenancy agreement if there's anything that you're unsure of or you suspect that some of the terms are unfair. According to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which has published a free leaflet 'Unfair tenancy terms - don't get caught out' (download from <a href=\"http://www.oft.gov.uk\">OFT</a> or order on 08706 060321), it would be unfair, for example, to hold you responsible for repairs to the structure of the property or those needed to get water, gas, electricity and/or heating and hot water systems in working order. This is legally the responsibility of the landlord. It's reasonable, on the other hand, to expect you not to break things and to keep the property clean.</p> <p>Do ask for a receipt for your deposit and make sure you attach it your copy of the tenancy agreement. It is also sensible to pay the deposit by cheque rather than cash so that you have proof of payment in the event of a dispute.</p> <p>Do check the inventory after you've moved in and get your landlord to sign any changes you make to it if, for example, items are missing. And take photographs - dated if possible - to show the condition of the property when you moved in. These will serve both as a reminder of what constitutes an acceptable level of cleanliness when you move out and as proof in case of dispute.</p> <p>Do pay your rent. Even if you are sorely tempted not to because of a dispute with your landlord. If you choose to withhold it, your landlord would be entitled to begin proceedings to evict you. And then not only would you lose your deposit - you would end up losing your home. </p>",
  "<p>Anyone who ventures into the downtrodden parts of Britain, from outer-city estates to inner-city ghettos, knows that many have to endure an existence that should shame a civilised country. Pushed to the margins, out of sight and often out of mind, they might live under the glare of whirling CCTV cameras, policed by officers in riot vans who try to keep a lid on disorder.</p> <p>Daily life is often a grind. On many of these estates, houses are invariably structurally sound, although many are empty and vandalised, their windows and doors boarded up with thick, galvanised sheeting. Gangs of youths, and older men - rarely women - sometimes roam the streets, often the worse for wear, making life for the law-abiding majority intolerable. A few, known to police and housing officers, are plainly out of control.</p> <p>As a short-term remedy, they might need to be restrained, curfewed or placed under restrictions if a small degree of normality is to return to an oppressed neighbourhood. So we should not diminish the importance of antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos) as a short-term fix to, perhaps, ban a troublesome youth (or an older man) from a shopping centre or a particular street.</p> <p>Asbos come in all shapes and sizes. Home Office figures show that more than 1,323 of them were taken out in the year to March 2004 - up 117% on the previous 12 months. More than 2,400 have been issued since the powers were introduced. But the prime minister wants councils to dish out many more. \"Asbos, acceptable behaviour orders, fixed penalty notices, dispersal orders, closing crack houses, controlling fireworks, clamping down on graffiti and litter - they can help those who play by the rules beat those who don't,\" proclaimed Tony Blair on his first day back from holiday.</p> <p>Expect more of this as the general election approaches. For all main parties recognise that being tough on crime - and remember, statistically, crime rates are falling - is a message that must be sent out to Middle England, which is doubtless why Blair chose the new town of Harlow, Essex, to relaunch his Asbo crusade; it is conveniently close to those key marginals in the south-east.</p> <p>But if we accept that Asbos are a short-term fix, what of the longer term? Perhaps we should start by recognising that the current definition of antisocial behaviour is extremely narrow. Target the troublemakers by all means, but also recognise that the seemingly respectable people in the local corner shop, where wall-to-wall cheap drink promotions are invariably the norm, can be accessories to antisocial behaviour. But they are small fry compared to a cut-price pub chain like the ubiquitous JD Wetherspoon, which slashed prices further last weekend to try to halt flagging sales and compete with the supermarkets.</p> <p>The group denied that selling cheaper drinks would fuel the binge drinking culture the government is trying to curb. \"There is no link in general terms between the price of drinks in pubs and public order issues,\" John Hutson, chief executive, is reported saying. \"We should not be excusing ourselves and saying, 'We'll put up prices', because the net result is handing our industry on a plate to the supermarkets.\"</p> <p>Antisocial behaviour? And all this in a week that marked the end of the government's first (eight-week) alcohol misuse enforcement campaign, the so-called \"Blunkett blitz\" against binge drinking, which creates mayhem - antisocial behaviour - in many towns and city centres at weekends. In the first four weeks of the blitz, police and trading standards officers undertook 141 operations - sending underage teens into pubs and off licences - and found that half of them were selling liquor illegally to the under-18s.</p> <p>As this campaign drew to a close, I happened to speak to an enthusiastic police officer in a small team in Manchester - which prides itself on being the Asbo capital of Britain, having taken out 474 orders since 2000 - charged with cracking down on alcohol abuse, and the liquor outlets that exploit the system. \"It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, a cut-throat business\" sighed Sgt Jan Brown.</p> <p>Blair, who launched the alcohol harm reduction strategy six months ago - one of its aims is to tackle drink-related disorder, as well as improving treatment for alcoholism - seems to be getting the message, although you can bet that the government will pull back from offending powerful interests in the leisure industry, which must bear some responsibility for antisocial behaviour.</p> <p>But what of the wider issues on the outer estates and the inner cities principally targeted for Asbos? Where is the wider vision for the community beyond the imposition of the antisocial order?</p> <p>It is not an easy question to answer in areas where unemployment or \"worklessness\" is endemic, where people have fallen outside any jobless statistic, and where there is little participation in the democratic process. But it is in no one's interests to ignore the reality of the other nation on our doorstep, where an Asbo is merely a palliative. And it is in everyone's interests to draw a much wider definition of antisocial behaviour.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Hetherington is the Guardian's regional affairs editor</p>",
  "<p>Children should be issued with smartcards to pay for school dinners to end the stigma suffered by those who get free meals, a charity says today. </p> <p>The Child Poverty Action Group has called for the cards as part of wide-ranging recommendations to improve school meals and ensure all children eat a healthy diet. </p> <p>The charity's report, Recipe for Change, calls on the government to raise widely discredited minimum nutritional standards which currently allow schools to serve daily helpings of chips. </p> <p>Earlier this week, ministers promised to review the basic requirements as part of a healthy living blueprint intended to help youngsters eat more sensibly and adopt healthier lifestyles. </p> <p>The move, 100 years after a parliamentary report into malnutrition heralded the introduction of school meals, is designed to halt the year-on-year rise in obesity among children under 11. </p> <p>The CPAG wants ministers to provide \"innovation grants\" to allow schools to introduce cashless payment systems for lunches, amid evidence that many children entitled to free meals do not take them due to fears they will be singled out or bullied. </p> <p>Smartcards, already in place in some schools, can be charged with credit automatically for children from low income families. One Sunderland school cited in the CPAG report uses iris scanning technology to check which youngsters take meals and deduct their credit accounts automatically.</p>",
  "<p>Key changes to the government's draft mental health bill are expected today as ministers unveil the long-awaited publication. </p> <p>The original version of the draft bill, published in June 2002, sparked widespread criticism and concern over its proposals on the compulsory detention and treatment of patients with mental disorders. </p> <p>But following discussions with mental health campaigners and other stakeholders, ministers are hoping their fears will have been allayed with the changes made. </p> <p>The revised draft bill is being launched today by health minister Rosie Winterton, the mental health \"tsar\", Louis Appleby, and Home Office minister Paul Goggins. </p> <p>The first draft, which included proposals to enable people with severe personality disorders to be detained even if they had committed no crime, was branded \"draconian\" by campaigning organisation the Mental Health Alliance. </p> <p>Campaigners criticised the very broad definition of patients who warranted compulsory treatment and detention, which would leave psychiatrists and social workers to make the decision. There were also concerns that the legislation could lead to more patients being detained, putting extra pressure on already under-staffed services. </p> <p>Ministers have insisted that the intention of the legislation was not to increase the number of people subject to compulsion. Speaking last November, Ms Winterton said the definition of mental disorder, along with strict conditions on who could be detained, would make sure only people for whom compulsory treatment was necessary would receive it. Ministers hope the revised bill will mean the right people get the right treatment at the right time, balanced with the need to protect the public. It should also include measures to ensure that people discharged from mental health services continue to take their medication and receive the necessary support in the community. </p> <p>But plans to use such community treatment orders (CTOs) in prisons are expected to be dropped. Mental health charity Sane said the reforms would only work if the extra staff and resources were put in to support the changes. </p> <p>Sane's chief executive, Marjorie Wallace, said: \"We have long campaigned for reforms to mental health laws so that they better protect both the individual who experiences mental illness and the interests of the families, professionals and the public. </p> <p>\"But our mental health services in many places appear to be facing breakdown, with a chronic shortage of doctors, nurses and skilled front-line staff, squalid and overcrowded wards, and too few supervised places in the community.\" </p> <p>Ms Wallace said that despite the government's recent efforts it would not be possible to provide the essential care and treatment for those whose freedoms were limited. </p> <p>\"The emphasis on compulsion should be on the government to fund the 'safe, sound and supportive' mental health services they promised when they came to power and made mental health a priority. Only if new laws are backed by improved services can they lead to compassionate care rather than increased fear and stigma,\" she added. </p> <p>The government has said it has taken time to publish the revised bill because they received more than 2,000 responses to the first draft. </p> <p>The bill is the first overhaul of the legislation since the 1950s, with the 1983 Mental Health Act only an update of previous laws.</p>",
  "<p>Being in a band is not necessarily a bed of roses. There are advances to pay back, promotional duties to fulfil and long bus journeys to endure. There are also gigs to play in front of small numbers of uninterested punters. The Boxer Rebellion, a grungey London-based four-piece, have been appointed as the latest saviours of Alan McGee's troubled Poptones label - their as-yet-untitled debut album is due early next year. The crowd do not appear thrilled at the news. </p> <p>As if to forestall a lack of applause, the band link their opening numbers with a sliver of feedback. They are clapped when they eventually do pause from their bassheavy quiet/loud melodics. They are also heckled. \"Fuck your Boxer Rebellion,\" bellows a drunk man from the stairs. Tennessee-born vocalist Nathan Brown tightens his mic stand in response. Resistance is never quite joined and the band retreats rather meekly into the background. </p> <p>Brown, with his nice cheekbones and funky scarf, may look the part, but he projects charisma like a muddy puddle. \"Rock'n'roll,\" he mutters occasionally, perhaps to remind himself he's not doing late shift at a funeral parlour. You might expect more guts and polemic from a band who take their name from a violent campaign of anti-imperialist insurrection. You might also expect some musical radicalism, but while the Boxer Rebellion fuse a spiky and often rather sophisticated rhythm section to fuzzy guitars and wailing vocals, most of their songs are informed by a straightforward rock aesthetic. They sound like Muse without the theatrics, or Black Rebel Motorcycle Club without the malignance. </p> <p>The context may well have something to do with it, and the driving, cacophonous Watermelon does lift things. But it's too little too late - and this from a band that should just be getting going.</p>",
  "<p>Air pollution will continue to claim lives in Britain because the air quality targets set for 2005 and 2010 will not be met, Mike Pilling of the University of Leeds told the British Association meeting.</p> <p>London will remain polluted with nitrogen dioxide and particles from traffic and other fossil fuel burning. </p> <p>Roads and main urban centres are likely to remain unhealthy environments. Further problems will blow in from abroad, according to aircraft studies of drifting pollution. </p> <p>He added: \"There are also other changes occurring. Temperatures will increase. </p> <p>\"We saw a big episode during August 2003, a heat wave, and there were something like 2,000 deaths ascribed to that heat. It is clear that perhaps 700 of those were due to the reduction in air quality. </p> <p>\"Changes will take place in the chemistry in the next 60 to 70 years, and in addition we will see increases in the incidence of these heat waves. </p> <p>\"So by 2070 we will be seeing something like a 10-fold increase in heat waves of the sort we saw last year.\" </p> <p>The government aimed to reduce concentrations of small particles of soot and oxides of nitrogen as if they were separate problems, but they should be treated together, he said: the pollutants interacted with each other, and even the abatement measures could interfere with each other. </p> <p>Some measures to reduce nitrogen oxides might lead to increases in ozone, a toxic form of oxygen important in the stratosphere, but a health hazard in the lower atmosphere. </p> <p>\"We need to take these into account as we frame legislation,\" Professor Pilling said. \"There are some complex processes occurring in the atmosphere.\" </p> <p>Moreover, pollution was no longer a local problem: British environmental researchers on a flight in July recorded plumes of carbon monoxide from forest fires in Alaska. </p> <p>\"It's going all the way round the globe,\" Prof Pilling added. \"The Americans suffer pollution from Asia, and we get pollution transported from the US to us. We are exporting to Asia. </p> <p>\"We are not just recipients, but it is clearly affecting the pollution that we experience in this country. We are still at an early stage of understanding what the effects are going to be.\"</p>",

She cited the example of the advert for Levis, which turned a 1960s song into a number one hit when the advert was shown in the 1980s.</p> <p>The current laws ban adverts that \"unduly appeal\" to children, thus allowing a balance between appealing to adults and youth.

  "<b>Beslan atrocity</b> <br> The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, condemned the Russian school atrocity as \"simply evil beyond reason or excuse\" after signing a book of condolence at the country's London embassy. <p>Mr Straw said he added his name \"to express our horror at the barbarity which had befallen the innocent children, women and men of Beslan and to express our profound sorrow at the grief of all those who lost loved ones and sympathy for the injured\". </p> <p>He added: \"No cause justifies such bestiality in any circumstances. What happened was simply evil beyond reason or excuse and we stand with the government and with the people of Russia at this terrible time of suffering.\" </p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, said: \"None of us can have been immune to the horror, the intense grief and the justified anger arising from the inhuman and obscene violence and murder which was meted out by vicious terrorists to innocent children and their parents and teachers.\" </p> <p><b>Sudan crisis</b><br> Everything possible will be done to make sure the Sudan crisis does not become another Rwanda or Bosnia, Mr Straw said. He told the Commons that Britain was pressing the UN to set down \"clear benchmarks\" for action by the government of Sudan to end the situation. </p> <p>Mr Straw told MPs: \"The UK is calling ... for clear benchmarks to be set, detailing what steps the Sudanese government must now take towards meeting its responsibilities and resolving the conflict.\" Political talks taking place in Nigeria offered the only prospect of a sustainable solution. </p> <p>The foreign secretary said: \"The situation is one which has rightly shocked the world. For out part, we are determined to do everything we can to resolve the humanitarian disaster and help secure a political settlement across the country as a whole. Ten years ago, the world turned away from the horrors of Rwanda and Bosnia. We all know the appalling result.\" </p> <p>Mr Ancram welcomed \"somewhat meagre improvements\" in aid and peace talks made since sanctions were threatened. But he said the Sudanese government had failed to disarm the Janjaweed militia behind much of the violence. </p> <p><b>Troops in Iraq</b><br> Ministers refused to set a firm date for withdrawal of British troops from Iraq. The armed forces minister, Adam Ingram, condemned the continuing violence and blamed it on an \"assortment of thugs and criminals\". He said: \"In no way do they enjoy the support of the local Iraqi people.\" Mr Ingram warned British troops would continue to \"respond robustly\" to the militia violence. </p> <p><b>Iraq intelligence</b><br> Evidence behind the government's dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was \"very thin\", the author of the critical report into intelligence used to justify the war, Lord Butler, said. </p> <p> Inquiry members saw this as a \"serious weakness\" which came home to roost as the conclusions about deployable WMD stocks turned out to be wrong, he told the Lords. But he insisted his report did not say \"no one was to blame for the shortcomings\" over the intelligence handling. </p> <p>Earlier, Foreign Office minister Lady Symons said she hoped the accusation that the decision to go to war in Iraq had been taken in bad faith could be laid to rest. She said: \"Lord Butler's report did raise important questions about intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis and presentation. The prime minister has said the government fully accepts the report's conclusions and criticisms and has already taken action to implement its recommendations.\" </p> <p><b>Postal voting</b><br> Voting for November's north-east referendum should be conducted under the traditional ballot box system or abandoned, Alan Duncan, for the Tories, demanded after a devastating report by the Electoral Commission on all-postal voting trials in June's council and European parliament polls. He said: \"Elections through the ballot box are trusted, elections through the post box are not.\" </p> <p>Junior constitutional affairs minister Christopher Leslie insisted all-postal pilots were \"worth a try\". The commission concluded that the majority of the public was satisfied, found the system more convenient and wanted it in future elections. \"My own feeling is that the public like to have a variety of different options when they cast their ballot and that will be the direction of policy development for the government.\" </p> <p><b>New Commons hours</b><br> The leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, was urged to abolish September sittings - barely an hour after MPs returned from their summer break. Labour's Andrew Dismore complained that they had to return to parliament - and in good weather - when they would be more gainfully employed doing constituency work. </p> <p>Mr Hain said many MPs had objected to the two-week September sitting, which the house voted for almost two years ago. He added: \"I am aware of the difficulties that the house and the house authorities face in not being able to take advantage of this time. On the other hand, parliament has been recalled in three of the last five years during September at the request of members.\" </p> <p><b>Anti-fraud measures</b><br> Measures intended to protect Britain against Enron-style corporate scandals were criticised as inadequate on both sides. Corporate governance minister Jacqui Smith defended the proposals during debate on the companies (audit, investigations and community enterprise) bill and insisted tough provisions introduced in the US were not appropriate for Britain. </p> <p>But Andrew Mitchell, for the Tories, accused the government of failing to tackle wholesale reform of company law. </p> <p><b>Building design</b><br> A bid to stamp out poor design in the disposal of publicly-owned land and property was launched by Labour's Roger Casale. He said good design was too often a \"happy accident\". His disposal of public land and property (design competitions) bill would encourage public bodies to hold design competitions when drawing up planning briefs. It was given an unopposed first reading but stands no chance of becoming law due to lack of parliamentary time. </p> <p><b>New Lords</b><br> Sir Anthony 'Ian' Young, former senior deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers' Union, took his seat on Labour's benches as Lord Young of Norwood Green. Former Countryside Agency chairman Sir Ewen Cameron took his seat on the crossbenches as Lord Cameron of Dillington. </p> <p><b>Alex Salmond</b><br> Alex Salmond was taunted for leading the Scottish National party from London as he made his first Commons appearance since being elected party leader for the second time. The Scottish secretary, Alistair Darling, said it was \"really good to see you in your place leading from London\". </p> <p>Mr Salmond said: \"I am actually full-time and elected, as opposed to part-time and supported like you.\" </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The prime minister and the Tory leader, Michael Howard, face each other at Commons question time. Earlier, the Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, and his ministers respond to MPs. The Tories open debates on government policies on pensioners and hospital-acquired infections. Backbench debates in Westminster Hall include the electricity market in Scotland and the red squirrel's survival in North East England. The Lords debates the armed forces (pensions and compensation) bill's report stage, the employment relations bill's third reading, the TSE (England)(amendment) regulations and the Christmas Day (trading) bill's committee stage.</p>",

  "The Belarussian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has announced a referendum next month, asking voters to let him seek five more years in office and raising the possibility that he might try to stay in power even longer. The authoritarian leader's second term expires in 2006. Under the decree, the poll will be held alongside parliamentary elections scheduled for October 17. Voters in the former Soviet republic, population 10 million, will be asked whether he should be allowed to run and whether they support repealing the current two-term limit. <p>\"When you think about how to vote, just think - would you like to see the house we started building together be completed?\" Mr Lukashenko said. </p> <p>First elected in 1994, Mr Lukashenko has made himself an outcast in the west by stifling dissent. </p> <p>Mr Lukashenko - who often accuses the US, the west and Russia of meddling in Belarussian affairs - said he wants a third term to stop outside forces taking control. His opponents have strongly opposed such plans. </p> <p>Elected on an anti-corruption platform, Mr Lukashenko extended his first term in a disputed referendum, dissolved an opposition-dominated parliament and won his current term in a 2001 vote that western governments and organisations said was neither free nor fair. </p> <p>Although popular among Belarussians who share his Soviet nostalgia, opposition leaders say he is losing favour as the country struggles to keep the centrally planned economy going.</p>",
  "<p>Bob Stott and Marie Melnyck are on a charm offensive, venturing south of the Midlands to show that Wm Morrison's grand plan for rapid growth has not crashed and burned. The duo, joint managing directors of the Bradford-based chain, are showing off their new Milton Keynes store - 57,000sq ft of former Safeway megastore. </p> <p>Mr Stott's patter is convincing: \"We are the best fishmonger ... we have a really super lightbulb business ... these banana racks are unique ... \" It does, indeed, look good enough to eat. </p> <p>Little more than two months ago the very idea of Morrisons making an effort to win friends and influence people was laughable, but that was before the profit warning that brought to an end 37 years of unbroken sales and profits growth. Chairman Sir Ken Morrison said profits would be \"substantially lower\" and analysts reckon that means 33% less than the \u00a3590m previously expected. </p> <p>The damage - all of it - has been inflicted by Safeway, the 480-strong chain that Morrisons battled to buy for 14 months and spent \u00a33bn to acquire. It was to be a transforming deal, which would enable the merged business to march into the number three position in the UK supermarket league, elbowing aside J Sainsbury. </p> <p>In reality, by the time Morrisons gained control, the Safeway business was haemorrhaging sales. Safeway's entire strategy of loss-leaders to pull in customers and higher prices on other items had backfired. Shoppers had been buying only the special offers and going elsewhere for their weekly trolleyload. The higher \"background\" prices had therefore been jacked up further to preserve profits short term. It was clearly unsustainable. </p> <p>Morrisons had to bring forward price cuts which have cut the cost of shopping at Safeway by 10% in an effort to win back 1.5m lost shoppers. </p> <p>Other problems included a weird system of extracting upfront payments from suppliers and a new accounting system installed by Safeway just weeks before its takeover which was incompatible with Morrisons. \"At best,\" says Mr Stott, \"that decision was cavalier.\" </p> <p>He insists that the carnage is just \"a hiccup\", but an element of doubt has crept in, even among the grocer's fans, as to whether Morrisons will be able to deliver on its promises. </p> <p>Hence, the Morrison two have descended on Milton Keynes to demonstrate what they can achieve with the Safeway estate. Converting the chain is a huge operation. Since July the Bradford-based grocer has been revamping three Safeway stores every week, and it plans to maintain that pace for the next two years. </p> <p>Before each conversion, store managers are dispatched to existing Morrisons' store to learn the way they do things in Yorkshire. Then staff have to be trained, store facilities upgraded and maintenance completed. As a result of previous neglect, says Mr Stott, the repairs have been far greater than expected: so much so that the average cost of each store revamp will now be \u00a31.5m, \u00a3500,000 more than expected. Milton Keynes cost a cool \u00a32m. But Mr Stott insists the budget can absorb the extra costs. </p> <p>Staff - lots of them - are being hired. Safeway ran a very lean operation while Morrisons is far more labour intensive as many products are put together or finished in store: sandwiches and salads for sale in the shop or the cafe are made by staff on the premises, cream cakes are filled and pizzas are topped. At Milton Keynes the number of employees has gone up from 374 to 600. </p> <p>Each store is closed for just three days and four nights for a full transformation, which includes everything from its trademark black-and-yellow signage to the precise location of the famous pie counter. </p> <p>So far the results from conversions look good, with sales up more than 30%. But the bald figures are misleading. Mr Stott admits they \"cannot be typical\", because the first conversions were in towns where Morrisons simply moved into a larger or better former Safeway store. In Milton Keynes, and probably hundreds of other stores, there is a mountain to climb. Sales just before conversion were down 25% from their peak, so Morrisons needs to increase sales by 33% just to get back to where Safeway once was. </p> <p>Behind the scenes a new 600,000sq ft distribution centre has been opened in Northampton to help stock the revamped Safeways. The number of lines stocked has grown from 20,000 to 22,000, as the Morrisons' buyers have cherry-picked winners from Safeway's old 30,000-strong product catalogue. Morrisons has also adopted entire Safeway ranges, including its Eat Smart healthy options and its The Best premium foods. </p> <p>Mr Stott is at pains to point out that Morrisons' reputation as a pile-it-high-sell-it-cheap retailer is misleading. \"Look at this range,\" he says, admiring a vast selection of olive oils to underline Morrisons' food credentials. </p> <p>But you can't take the Yorkshire out of Morrisons for long. Does Mr Stott worry that Morrisons is not a renowned wine seller? \"We'd rather get on with selling it.\" Do they stock any of the more exotic meats, such as ostrich? \"No. We tried it. It didn't work. We don't put things on the shelves to throw them away.\" </p> <p>What about the very limited non-food ranges? \"We will sell you a kettle or an iron\", says Mr Stott, \"but if you want a TV will you please go elsewhere.\"</p>",
  "The ceasefire called by the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr appeared to be crumbling last night following two days of violent clashes in the Baghdad suburb of Sadr City. <p>At least 36 Iraqis and one US soldier were killed, pushing the total number of US military casualties in Iraq over 1,000. </p> <p>Fighting erupted on Monday afternoon between Mr Sadr's supporters and US troops, fizzling out at dawn yesterday before resuming at 7am. It then raged for most of the day. </p> <p>Yesterday afternoon US tanks had taken up positions in the heart of the impoverished Shia slum, and next to the police station. Bradley fighting vehicles were deployed at roundabouts, their guns pointing in all directions. </p> <p>Further down the road, close to Mr Sadr's office, young men in civilian clothes could be seen uncoiling lengths of blue electrical wire - apparently to attach to roadside bombs. Large holes had been gouged in the asphalt. </p> <p>Locals said the clashes had broken out after a provocative American patrol on Monday deep into Sadr City, a stronghold of Mr Sadr's Mahdi army militia. </p> <p>'The Americans tried to arrest some people from the Mahdi army,\" Abu Hussein, a 20-year-old shopkeeper told the Guardian. \"They come here, and start randomly arresting and randomly shooting. Then the Mahdi army fires back. </p> <p>\"We have agreed to put our weapons away. But the Americans still try and arrest us.\" </p> <p>The latest fighting, in which 203 people were injured, according to hospital officials, comes after a period of relative calm. Last week Mr Sadr called on his followers to observe a ceasefire and announced that he planned to enter politics. But he only agreed to call off his three-week uprising following the intervention of Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani, Iraq's most important Shia cleric. </p> <p>Yesterday, the US military said it came under attack numerous times and that at least one soldier had been killed and two injured while they waited for a team to defuse a roadside bomb. </p> <p>\"We just kept coming under fire,\" said Captain Brian O'Malley. </p> <p>The number of US troops who have died reached 999, with three civilians working for the Pentagon also killed, taking the toll to more than 1,000. </p> <p>All but 138 US personnel were killed after combat operations had been declared over. </p> <p>The youngest to die was 18 and the oldest, 59, according to an Associated Press analysis of Department of Defense statistics; 97% were men; about two dozen were women. Although more than 600 were white, others were black, Hispanic, Asian and American Indian. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The US army is preparing to abandon a contract with Halliburton, the company formerly run by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, which has been investigated for allegedly overcharging it. </p> <p>The contract to provide housing, food and other services to US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, potentially worth $13bn (\u00a37.2bn), is expected to be broken into smaller parts and opened to competitive bids in the next few months.</p>",
  "The number of scientific experiments carried out on non-human primates increased last year by 20%, despite a reduction in the number of primates used in research overall. Animal rights campaigners pointed to the increase as proof that scientists are not making enough effort to find alternatives. <p>The figures were released yesterday by the Home Office. Scientists hit back at the anti-vivisectionists' claims by pointing to the overall fall in the use of animals in the last 30 years, despite the vastly increased levels of medical research being carried out. </p> <p>The number of experiments on all animals in the UK in 2003 rose to just over 2.79m, an increase of about 59,000 (2.2%) on 2002. Most of the procedures - 85% - were carried out on rodents, with most of the rest using fish (6%) and birds (4%). </p> <p>Nicky Gordon, the science officer at the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, said: \"Non-human primates are our closest relatives and their capacity to suffer, experience stress and feel pain is clear for all to see. Subjecting them to medical research and toxicology experiments which require them to undergo brain surgery and swallow poisons is abhorrent and should be ended immediately.\" </p> <p>Experiments on non-human primates rose from 3,977 in 2002 to 4,799 in 2003, despite a 24% decrease in the number of primates involved. </p> <p>\"This increase is mainly down to neurological research,\" said Dr Simon Festing, of the Association of Medical Research Charities. \"Because of the ageing population, we are seeing greater emphasis on research into diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.\" </p> <p>Penny Hawkins, a scientific officer at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said that the \"scientific community has repeatedly told us that they don't like using non-human primates ... Yet the statistics here tell a very different story.\" </p> <p>The Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries said the increase needed to be put into context. \"While there was an increase of just over 2% in the number of animal procedures for 2003 over the previous year, the figures have to be set against a backdrop of increased government funding for biomedical research, as well as a 12.4% jump in the number of compounds in the pre-clinical research and development pipeline.\" </p> <p>Professor Colin Blakemore, chief executive of the Medical Research Council, said: \"The target everyone hopes for is that a time will come when no animal use will be needed at all. We have a tremendous success story as far as that is concerned because numbers have fallen by a factor of two since the 1970s. So if there is a small increase this year then you have to see this against a background of a 50% fall over the last 30 years.\" </p> <p>The overall increase of animal use in 2003 is due, in part, to the greater use of genetically modified animals in research aimed at understanding what the 30,000 or so genes inside every human cell actually do. </p> <p>\"One of the things you can do is add a human gene to a mouse so that he mouse gets a disease it otherwise would not have got, like cystic fibrosis,\" said Dr Festing. \"Then you can observe the mouse and try out new therapies on it.\" </p> <p>But Ms Hawkins said: \"Do we actually need to know what every single gene does? Often this is being done without a clear applied medical benefit in mind.\" </p> <p>Vivisection has become an increasingly fraught issue this year. In January, Cambridge University abandoned plans for a new neuroscience research facility, citing rising security costs as a result of animal rights campaigns. In July, the main contractor behind the new animal research lab at Oxford University pulled out after pressure by animal rights groups. Two weeks later, the Home Office published plans to toughen the law against protests outside the homes of scientists. </p> <p>Last weekend, animal rights campaigners from around the world met in Kent to learn how to put pressure on companies and universities that practice vivisection. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the government announced the formation of a research centre for the replacement, refinement and reduction (known as the 3Rs) of animals in research, with a budget of around \u00a3600,000.</p>",
  "Sorry to disappoint Yasmin Ataullah, but the new law in France outlawing conspicuous signs of faith, including the hijab, in state schools, which came into effect last week, went off smoothly (Liberals can also be fundamentalists, September 4). This could, of course, have something to do with the fact that the majority of Muslim girls welcomed the new law. Even the Union of Islamic Associations in France supported it.

  "The government promised yesterday to hunt down Britain's 5,000 most prolific criminals and offer them the choice between getting help to change their ways - and a long jail term. <p>The latest public order initiative by the home secretary, David Blunkett, is based on police data suggesting that a relatively small number of repeat offenders is responsible for much \"routine\" crime. </p> <p>But the project was criticised as \"crude guesswork\" by crime researchers, who said the police would end up going after minnows rather than the big fish. And the probation officers' union Napo accused Mr Blunkett of repackaging work \"which all justice agencies have been carrying out for 30 years\". </p> <p>Mr Blunkett launched the prolific and priority offenders programme in Leeds, where police have pioneered a drive against repeat criminals. He said a combination of good detective work and rapid legal action would give the project a distinctive edge. </p> <p>The emphasis was on stopping convicted \"priority cons\" returning to crime. Drug treatment and other closely monitored rehabilitation would be part of the deal, with prison waiting for participants who did not comply. He said no government had succeeded in getting all the law and social service agencies to work together. </p> <p>\"We have to give these people a way out. We have to ensure that when they come out of prison someone meets them, their immediate housing and employment needs are looked after and there is someone they can call on,\" he said. </p> <p>Richard Garside, director of the Crime and Society Foundation, said the list of 5,000 \"targets\" was largely made up of those most vulnerable to capture, not necessarily those who caused the most harm.</p>",
  "Britain's biggest retail brands have them - and now loyalty cards are being offered by charity shops as part of a bid to hold on to customers and survive increasingly tough competition on the high street. <p>Healthcare charity Sue Ryder believes its CareCard, piloted in some of the charity's 400 shops, is a first. It gives customers a reward \"stamp\" for purchases over \u00a35, which can then be redeemed as money off future purchases.</p> <p>The card is a way for charity shops to tackle the threat from rival good cause shops and from high street discount retailers, says a Sue Ryder spokesman. \"It's a different world we operate in now. We have to innovate and be prepared to try new things.\"</p> <p>According to the latest annual charity shops report by Charity Finance magazine, such tactics could be away of staying afloat in a \"saturated\" market. The report concludes that if the charity shop sector is to protect profits, it must find novel ways to beat off fierce competition from price-cutting retail giants such as Asda and Tesco, whose financial muscle means they can offer new goods at similar prices to second-hand items.</p> <p>According to the survey, loss of custom is the \"major issue\" of concern for charity shops - although they also include rising insurance costs, the financial impact of new legislation on health and safety and disability, and attracting sufficient volunteers staff.</p> <p>As well as the big retailers, auction websites - such as eBay - and car boot sales are cutting into charity shop profits. While there are positive signs, such as a slight increase in the net number of shop openings, average profit per pound is declining.</p>",
  "<p>Are Margaret Hodge and her boss, Charles Clarke, still on speaking terms? Let's hope so, because there is a dreadful muddle to be sorted out at the Department for Education and Skills, and it threatens to spoil all the good intentions for reform of children's services in the wake of the Victoria Climbi\u00e9 tragedy.</p> <p>Just over a year ago, when Clarke took over as education secretary and Hodge became children's minister, they spoke with a single voice. It was essential, they said, to avoid communications breakdowns between the various agencies concerned with children's welfare, of the sort that contributed to Victoria's death.</p> <p>The answer, they said, was for every local authority in England to merge its education department with the children's division of social services. The combined operation should be put under the control of a powerful director of children's services, with responsibility for establishing seamless joint working.</p> <p>As a second step, every area should set up a children's trust to integrate the work of the children's department with other freestanding agencies, such as the NHS and youth justice.</p> <p>The proposals were included in the children bill, which passed the Lords in the summer and is due a second reading in the Commons shortly.</p> <p>So far, so coherent. But then, in July, Clarke announced his department's five-year-plan for education. It proposed devolving power from local authorities to schools, giving headteachers more autonomy and guaranteeing them three-year budgets to make it easier to plan improvements in teaching and learning.</p> <p>As the department put it: \"The local authority function will shift from service delivery to commissioning services from local agencies - strategist rather than provider.\"</p> <p>Whatever the educational merits of this approach, it raised unsettling questions. Was there still any point in merging the rump education department with children's social services, a provider department? And how would a merger enhance cooperation between social workers and freestanding schools?</p> <p>The questions became even harder to answer when social services chiefs found that schools would not be placed under a statutory duty to cooperate with other child welfare organisations. Of course, the best schools would continue to look after their pupils' full range of needs, as they always have. But those under pressure to raise educational performance might be expected to give a fairly low priority to cooperation with other welfare bodies.</p> <p>Indeed, the danger arises that organisational change may be about to damage what cooperation there is. Over the past fortnight, ancient hostilities were resurfacing.</p> <p>A coalition of 15 organisations - including the Metropolitan police, Local Government Association, Association of Directors of Social Services and children's charities - was formed to demand changes to the bill to make headteachers cooperate.</p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, responded: \"This is a step too far. Schools already have ample responsibilities in this field ... I fear local authorities may use the bill to try to re-instate some of the power over schools which they have lost in recent years.\"</p> <p>The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers was less restrained. Chris Keates, acting general secretary, said: \"It is nothing short of breathtaking arrogance for the LGA and its associates ... to single out schools from all the other services for the imposition of a legal requirement to cooperate and to change the way they work.\"</p> <p>The group of 15 replied: \"Our concern is that schools have been singled out as the only key agency not to be given this new duty in the children bill. Schools are at the heart of services for children, and their omission from the duty to cooperate is astonishing.\"</p> <p>The antagonism of these exchanges does not bode well for the intended cooperation between agencies.</p> <p>Six weeks ago, Dame Denise Platt, chair of the Commission for Social Care Inspection, raised some of the difficult questions at a conference of agencies affected by the bill. She asked how devolution of power to schools would increase integration and whether devolution of budgets to schools might diminish resources available to children's trusts.</p> <p>When the Guardian asked the DfES to read through her speech and provide the answers, it was slow to respond. Its eventual two-sentence reply said: \"Local authorities will retain statutory responsibility for the welfare and education of every child. Local authorities have a key role in bringing together education, under fives and children's social services together at a local level in the new children's trusts - to secure better outcomes for children, and in championing the needs of parents and pupils in their areas.\"</p> <p>Platt might be forgiven for thinking that that slender response did not do justice to her questions.</p> <p>Clarke and Hodge must do better, and explain to councils how the gains of merging children's social services with a neutered education department outweigh the losses from breaking the link between children's and adults' social services. And it would be good to see them practising joined-up government at the centre as well as preaching it to local authorities.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Carvel is the Guardian's social affairs editor</p>",
  "<p><strong>Proud reminder</strong><br></p> <p>Thank you for publishing DBC Pierre's account of the Durham Miners' Gala (Moving on seamlessly, September 1).

Yet while I was listened to with patience and respect, each of my illnesses was treated separately and never reviewed as a whole for connecting causes and pain experiences. However, at last there are some signs of movement in the NHS. There is the roll out in London of the National Primary Care Collaborative, to which my GP has nominated me as a patient adviser.</p> <p><strong>Barry Silverman</strong></p> <p>London</p> <p><strong>Equally at fault</strong></p> <p>Malcolm Dean is right to support the government's efforts to set up a single equality body (Opinion, September 1).</p> <p>However, establishing a single equality commission is only the first step in bringing clarity to the legal bureaucracy that surrounds anti-discrimination law. It is overly complex, inconsistent and provides different standards of protection across disability, religion, race, gender, sexual orientation and age. In addition, there is no provision for multiple discrimination, which is often the reality for the 50,000 people living with HIV in the UK.</p> <p>Without a single equality act, bureaucracy and legal confusion will continue to exist. Harmonising anti-discrimination laws should be a matter of priority for the government. We hope that the bill in October will not be delayed and that the first thing on the single equality commission's agenda will be harmonising the legal framework surrounding discrimination.</p> <p><strong>Deborah Jack, chief executive</strong></p> <p>National Aids Trust</p> <p>We urge the government not to waver in its determination to set up the Commission for Equality and Human Rights, and look forward to its inclusion in the Queen's speech later this year.</p> <p>Discrimination does not fall into neat categories. As individuals, we have a range of characteristics - our race, gender, religion, sexuality, and so on. Whatever those characteristics, all of us are affected by the march of time. It is in everybody's interests to ensure that discrimination against people because of their age is eliminated.</p> <p>Consider the multiple discrimination faced by many older people today. After all, this is the Windrush generation, the generation of women who have carved out a career later in life after raising a family, and gay men and lesbian women who are redefining sexuality in old age after a lifetime of prejudice.</p> <p>The strength of the proposed new commission is that it recognises that diversity, and will be equipped to deal with it. If it were not to go ahead, employers and service providers would have a multiplicity of doors to knock on for advice, rather than just one. There would be no body charged with combating age discrimination, and the cause of age equality would be set back 10 years.</p> <p><strong>Tessa Harding, senior policy adviser</strong></p> <p>Help the Aged</p> <p><strong>Tipping the balance</strong></p> <p>OPT proposes that the UK population should be reduced by over 1 million per year for the next 26 years (Crowd control, September 1). Since OPT is not of the hard right, it suggests that this should be achieved through social engineering rather than compulsory repatriation. This will mean drastically reducing the number of births over this period, so that the old will get older while the young slowly cease to exist.</p> <p>Since it is now accepted that, over the next three decades, there will be a massive shift in balance towards the aged and infirm, even without any population reduction, 30 million will actually be far less sustainable than the current 60 million. Perhaps OPT is also considering other social engineering methods, such as compulsory euthanasia.</p> <p><strong>Robert Brook</strong></p> <p>Shrewsbury</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Write to: SocietyGuardian 119 Farringdon Road London EC1R 3ER or fax 020-7713 4154 or email <a href=\"mailto:society@theguardian.com\">society@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Ministers were challenged last night to hand responsibility for government agencies and non-elected bodies to councils and self-governing communities in a sweeping transfer of power to town halls and neighbourhoods. <p>Launching a radical manifesto, which challenges the Conservative party as much as the government, the body representing England's town halls said the country's floundering democracy could only be revived by handing powers to local people. </p> <p>The Local Government Association attacked ministers for running the most centralised country in the west and called for a \"bonfire of quangos\". </p> <p>Unveiling a manifesto for local communities, the LGA's new chairman and the Tory leader of Kent county council, Sir Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, said the multitude of government agencies operating locally was out of control. </p> <p>They spent four times as much as local government yet were \"unelected, unaccountable and often insufficiently audited\", he said. </p> <p>The manifesto calls for sweeping reforms of local taxation, giving councils the power to raise three-quarters of funds from a variety of sources. Currently, council tax raises only a quarter of local spending. </p> <p>The LGA also urges ministers to slash the number of targets imposed on councils.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Team news</strong> </p> <p>Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Paul Robinson gets his first competitive international start after Sven-Goran Eriksson dropped David James for England's World Cup qualifier in Poland tonight. </p> <p>James pays the price for an embarrassing, but not entirely surprising series of blunders in Austria on Saturday, with Robinson making only his second start for his country in Chorzow. His club team-mate Jermain Defoe also starts his first England game up front, replacing Manchester United's Alan Smith. </p> <p>England skipper David Beckham is fit to take up his place in midfield after recovering from a rib injury, while Chelsea full-back Wayne Bridge is once again selected to play on the left flank. </p> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Visitors England play in red shirts, white shorts and red socks tonight, with the home side lining out in white shirts, red shorts and white socks. Confused already? Good. Poland kick off playing from left to right in front of a very partisan crowd. Paul Robinson's first touch in a competitive international is a lengthy punt to the halfway line from a backpass. </p> <p> <strong>2 mins:</strong> Poland win a throw-in deep in England territory. It's hoisted into the box and headed clear. England win two corners in quick succession, but nothing comes from either of them. </p> <p> <strong>4 mins:</strong> For Poland, Rasiak rifles an effort narrowly wide from a cross at the near post. Slack marking by England. Meanwhile, an email: \"If the England game gets boring can you keep us informed of the Ireland v Switzerland match,\" writes Pearse Murray. No problem Pearse - as if simultaneously watching one match, typing a description of it with two fingers (and you can guess which other two I'm waving in your direction at the moment) and reading unreasonable requests from lazy gits on email wasn't enough to be going on with. </p> <p> <strong>7 mins:</strong> It's all a bit scrappy at the moment, with no chances of any sort going to either side. The camera pans onto Sven in the dug-out, who is sitting all on his own with an empty seat either side of him. His harem mustn't have travelled with him to this game. </p> <p> <strong>12 mins:</strong> Glenn Hoddle is co-commentating on this game on Sky. He's just said a sentence with the word \"situation\" in it once and the phrase \"at this moment in time\" in it twice. Impressive, even by his standards. Now he says that England are looking reasonably lively in the final third, although they haven't carved out any chances yet. </p> <p> <strong>13 mins:</strong> For Poland, Mila tries to thread a through ball into the England box for Kosowski to latch on to. Ledley King cuts it out and England counter. Defoe peels off his marker, wins the ball and tees up a shot for Frank Lampard. His effort from distance is feeble and doesn't trouble Jerzy Dudek in the slightest. </p> <p> <strong>14 mins:</strong> Brian McCloskey writes, somewhat apologetically: \"David James dropped?\" he says. \"Now he knows what a ball crossed into his six-yard-box feels like.\" Funny man. </p> <p><strong>17 mins:</strong> Pete Dunstan writes: \"I'm watching Holland vs. Czech Republic. Jealous?\" Er, no I'm not Peter. If your life is so empty that you feel the need to write in and tell me what you're doing, I don't envy you or it in the slightest. To be honest, given the choice of all tonight's games, I'd rather be watching Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom on BBC1. </p> <p> <strong>19 mins:</strong> This match is a dire spectacle at the moment. Absolutely dreadful. England are edging it in that they're holding on to the ball a bit more than Poland, but they're not doing a lot with it. Oh, hold on ... after great build-up play from Cole and Bridge, Defoe lifts a glorious chance wide of Jerzy Dudek's left-hand post. </p> <p> <strong>23 mins:</strong> Wayne Bridge sends in a cross from the left wing, which David Beckham volleys wide. Poland go on the attack and John Terry is forced to clear off the line after - I think - Zewlakow gets on the end of an attempted Ledley King clearance. Poland are looking fairly dangerous down the left wing, with Kryznowek proving very adept at getting in behind the England defence to send in dangerous crosses. </p> <p> <strong>28 mins:</strong> Michael Owen gets a yellow card for kicking the ball away after the whistle had gone, although it may have been for dragging Rzasa to the ground while attempting to chase a Steven Gerrard through-ball. </p> <p> <strong>29 mins:</strong> Wayne Bridge attempts to cross from the left wing, but Bak wins a throw-in with a meaty challenge. At the back for England, Gary Neville looks injured. He hobbles off the pitch to be replaced by Jamie Carragher. </p> <p> <strong>32 mins:</strong> \"Isn't anybody following the Holland-Czech match?\" inquires Justin Go. Well I'm sure somebody is Justin - just not here. Our millions and millions of readers in Holland and the Czech Republic will be devastated. </p> <p> <strong>36 mins: Poland 0 - 1 England</strong> Jermain Defoe puts England ahead with a wonderful piece of skill. Despite the close attentions of a Poland defender Glowacki, not to mention standing with his back to goal, he controls a good pass from David Beckham in the box, turns his marker inside out and tucks the ball past Jerzy Dudek. </p> <p> <strong>41 mins:</strong> Sorry about that delay. It's been quite a while since I had to describe an England goal and I'd forgotten how to do it. Mila has two shots in a row for Poland, both of which are blocked. His first effort was mis-hit horribly and he should have equalised. Krzynowek is wreaking havoc down the left side for Poland on the rare occasion they get out of their own half. </p> <p> <strong>44 mins:</strong> Poland attack down the right for a change, but Zurawski's cross is hacked clear by Ledley King. About 30 seconds later Zurawski has a shot blocked and his team-mate Lewandowski follows up. His effort cannons off an England defender too. Fair play to England - they're nothing if not consistent: go in front, panic and then do their best to concede an equaliser. They're living dangerously here, but the half-time whistle saves them. </p> <p> <strong>Half-time</strong></p> <p> <strong>Elsewhere in Europe:</strong> Northern Ireland are beating Wales 1-0 (that was an 8pm kick-off), while Switzerland and Rep of Ireland (7:30pm) are drawing one apiece. </p> <p> <strong>Amusing half-time email:</strong> \"Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom v Poland and England? Not quite sure which drama starring an aging lothario, a feisty love interest and a white knuckle ride on a rickety wooden vehicle to watch tonight,\" writes Ian Pierpoint. </p> <p>Read and learn - that's funny. The rest of you would be better off thinking up gags like that rather than sending in emails pointing out my typos and asking what the score between Bosnia and Spain is. </p> <p><strong>45 mins: Poland 1- 1 England</strong> Ian Pierpoint - you have been usurped. That's even funnier. England throw away another lead, as is their wont. A brilliant through-ball carves open the England defence, Zurawski latches onto it and rifles the ball past Robinson into the top right-hand corner. A great strike. </p> <p> <strong>50 mins:</strong> Zurawski goes close again, but his long range effort from the right fizzes past Robinson and over the angle of crossbar and upright. </p> <p> <strong>52 mins:</strong> According to Sky's man on the touchline, the fights are breaking out in the stands, with England and Poland fans throwing missiles at each other over a cordon of police. Great stuff. In the Wales v Northern Ireland match, Northern Ireland lead Wales 2-1 and there's been three sendings-off. </p> <p> <strong>55 mins:</strong> Bak (pronounced \"bonk\", for those like me who still get a giggle out of things like that) goes close for Poland. England are in total disarray and have been since they scored. No change there, then. </p> <p> <strong>56 mins: Poland 1 - 2 England</strong> England regain the lead with a simple enough goal. Ashley Cole crossed from the left, Owen and Glowacki both went for it at the near post and one of them turned it in. Difficult to tell who got the final touch, but I'm sure the Real Madrid man will claim it and Glowacki won't object. </p> <p> <strong>61 mins:</strong> \"This is Sheryl Farrell,\" writes Sheryll Farrell. \"I am writing to you to confirm that we have accepted your mortgage application (Eh? - BG.). Our office has confirmed that you can get a $220,000 loan for as low as $352.00 per month payment. The approval process takes no longer than a minute, so please fill out the form on our website.\" </p> <p> <strong>63 mins:</strong> England are back on top again, as are their 3000 fans in the stadium if the strains of the English national anthem I can hear in the background are anything to go by. </p> <p><strong>67 mins:</strong> \"They're eating monkey brains now,\" writes Jack Hughes, who is either watching Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom or keeping an eye on the activities of the misbehaving England supporters at this match. </p> <p> <strong>69 mins:</strong> Poland substitution: Rasiak off, Niedzielan on. That's Poland's second substitution. Needless to say, I missed the first one. Steven Gerrard drops his shoulder, goes on a surging run through the Polish defence and tries a shot from left to right. It's blocked and goes out for a throw. </p> <p><strong>71 mins:</strong> \"Great name for a rock band there: Goes Close for Poland,\" writes Mike Fitts. \"I guess England Are In Total Disarray would seem like some kind of 1977 punk nostalgia band.\" Thanks for that Mike. You just concentrate on unmatting your hair, getting better and make sure to stay off that acid. </p> <p> <strong>74 mins:</strong> \"My dilemma is do I follow your comments or soccernets?\" writes Andy in San Francisco, conveying the impression that he thinks I care whose comments he follows. Why not follow them both simultaneously - England muight be playing better on the other one. Poland appear to have thrown in the towel here - always a sound policy.</p> <p> <strong>78 mins:</strong> Jonathan Vincent in Zurich has written in to complain about me not commenting enough on the match. \"People outside the UK don't give a stuff about mortgage rates. Come on, cut out the funny ha-ha and give me a match commentary?\" he pleads. Who says things like \"cut out the funny ha-ha\", eh? Are you by any chance 65 and a retired geography teacher, Jonathan? Poland substitution: Kosowski off, Gorawski on. </p> <p> <strong>81 mins:</strong> Something quite interesting involving David Beckham and Jermain Defoe happens in the Poland penalty area. I'd tell you what, but then I'd just be pandering to Jonathan Vincent in Zurich and we can't have that. </p> <p> <strong>83 mins:</strong> Free-kick for England wide on the left. David Beckham tees it up, crosses it in towards the far post and Jerzy Dudek plucks it from the air. Good catch. Beckham starts feeling his bruised ribs, lest we forget what a martyr he is for soldiering on tonight despite his injury. Ireland's Roy Keane is playing with two <em>fractured</em> ribs tonight, you big girl.</p> <p> <strong>85 mins:</strong> A low Beckham snap-shot from about 25 yards goes straight into Jerzy Dudek's breadbasket. Quite what he's doing with a breadbasket on a football field is anyone's guess. </p> <p> <strong>87 mins:</strong> England substitution: Jermain Defoe off, Kieron Dyer on. Lock up your daughters. </p> <p> <strong>88 mins:</strong> \"Are you watching the match or are you reading email and trying to be witty?\" writes Boyd Barker, who should probably hook up with Jonathan Vincent for a mad lads' night out. Substitution: David Beckham off, Owen Hargreaves on. </p> <p> <strong>90 mins:</strong> There'll be another four minutes of this scrappy madness. Can Poland nick an equaliser? I can't see it coming myself. </p> <p> <strong>90+1 mins:</strong> Kieron Dyer sends in a low hard cross from the right wing, which almost but doesn't quite fall nicely for the onrushing Owen Hargreaves. Poland clear.</p> <p><strong>90+3 mins:</strong> Peep! Peep! Peep! The match peters out into nothing and England take the points. Last word tonight goes to John Gingell, who might want to go chilling with Boyd Barker and Jonathan Vincent before he dies of an overdose of pomposity. \"If you are not going to describe the game and restrict yourself to inane comments on other matters, could you please tell us where we can follow the game on line,\" he says in a most self-important fashion. I could tell you John, but unfortunately it's over now, so I there wouldn't be much point. Elsewhere in the World Cup qualifiers, the Republic of Ireland have drawn one apiece with Switzerland, Northern Ireland have drawn two apiece with Wales in a humdinger at the Millennium Stadium and Scotland have playede out a scoreless draw with Slovenia. That's your lot - thanks for your time and your emails. </p> <p> <strong>Poland:</strong> Dudek, Mila, Rzasa, Zewlakow, Glowacki, Bak, Rasiak, Krzynowek, Zurawski, Lewandowski, Kosowski.<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Boruc, Klos, Kukielka, Baszcyznski, Niedzielan, Gorawski, Smolarek.</p> <p> <strong>England:</strong> Robinson, Neville, Terry, King, Ashley Cole, Beckham, Lampard, Gerrard, Bridge, Defoe, Owen. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Carragher, James, Hargreaves, Dyer, Wright-Phillips, Smith, Vassell.</p> <p> <strong>Referee:</strong> Stefano Farina (Italy)</p>",
  "Ian McCartney, the Labour chairman dogged by speculation that he is about to be sidelined, yesterday hit back at his \"unacceptable\" anonymous critics and insisted he was still the man for the job. <p>In a confident interview with the Guardian, he refused to say on what basis he could work alongside Alan Milburn, the man being tipped as Tony Blair's election coordinator. </p> <p>Mr McCartney's intervention came as the prime minister used his monthly No 10 press conference to promise that his much-delayed reshuffle will take place later this week, and insisted that no one will have a veto over his decisions. </p> <p>Mr Blair swept aside questions about his reshuffle plans or reported battles with Gordon Brown to insist that \"the government that I lead, I would say, is the most ideologically united government that I can imagine for a very long time\". </p> <p>There was a growing mood at Westminster last night that Mr McCartney will retain the chairmanship and Mr Milburn will pull out of a return to the cabinet after failing to receive assurances that he will be given a substantial role over either the manifesto or election strategy. </p> <p>The outcome will be seen as a victory for the chancellor, and a setback for the Blairite cause. </p> <p>A friend of Mr Milburn said: \"The problem is any election coordination strategy or responsibility for the manifesto seems to run right across Gordon Brown's territory. It is still a decision for Mr Blair but it looks like Gordon will get his way yet again.\" </p> <p>There was also some indication that Mr Milburn was reluctant to return to frontline politics after the furore about his possible appointment as chairman, with all the implications for the disruption of his family life. </p> <p>Further signs of Labour confidence emerged yesterday despite internal party squabbles. It emerged that ministers have decided to risk staging the Hartlepool byelection - to replace Peter Mandelson, the new EU commissioner - on September 30, the last day of Labour's conference, in the hope that a win would squash the rival Tory event before it starts. </p> <p>And Mr Blair felt confident enough of his own position to joke with reporters about suggestions that he hopes to be in No 10 if Britain wins the 2012 Olympics. \"Yes - and I want to compete in them, too.\" </p> <p>The prime minister dismissed talk of splits. In his interview Mr McCartney also denounced briefings by Blairite and Brownite factions, saying: \"As I travel the country one of the most common complaints of party members is that they feel their hard work on the doorstep is often undermined by ill-discipline and briefing within the Westminster village.\" </p> <p>Rejecting the criticisms of himself, he said: \"When you're basically described, and the best way of paraphrasing, as an inarticulate working class man from Glasgow who's very liked but ain't that much good, you know it's a caricature too far.\" </p> <p>Not only had he brought the unions back on side, he also rejected the accusation that he did not have the media skills to win over swing voters in middle England. </p> <p>He said: \"Britain is made up of different backgrounds and accents, and thank goodness for that. </p> <p>\"I'm very proud of my background and very proud of my accent, that's never been an issue. It's more an issue for Westminster village, to be perfectly frank with you.\" </p> <p>Admitting to anxiety about his fate, he said: \"We're all human beings, we get pricked and bleed but it's part and parcel of the life of a politician in government. The most difficult part and maybe the part which was unacceptable was when people brief against you on a personal basis.\" </p> <p>He challenged the briefers to go on the record or shut up: \"If people want to make comments to journalists, I think it's quite legitimate that those should be on the record - then we all know who's making them.\" </p> <p>He also rejected any suggestion that his strong links to the unions was a problem: \"I've got very good relations with the CBI. I'm not in anyone's camp. I'm my own person.\" </p> <p>He defended his overall record as party chairman, saying he had \"credibility as a kind of bridge between party and government, the party and the country\". </p> <p>Disclosing that the unions were contributing \u00a33m to Labour's coffers, Mr McCartney said: \"A year ago the unions were organising a campaign - the leading trade unionists - to reclaim the Labour party.\" This year at conference they were running a campaign to work together for a third term, \"so it's light years away from where they were\". </p> <p>Mr McCartney echoed Mr Blair's own optimism, despite \"mid-term\" setbacks in local and European elections. </p> <p>He insisted: \"People know where we're going to and why we're going there - and why we need to be there.\"</p>",
  "<p>Chocolate retailer Thorntons yesterday reported a 25% jump in underlying annual profit as new ranges and a move to sell its sweets through other retailers helped to reverse five years of decline. </p> <p>When John Thornton retired as chairman in April, 93 years of family control was ended. The company, which has received two takeover approaches in the last year, said it expected further growth after an encouraging start to its new financial year. </p> <p>Like-for-like sales rose 2.6% in the year to June 26, though this was against a weak performance the previous year. </p> <p>Sales were boosted by the relaunch of Thorntons' Continental boxed chocolate range, as well as new products such as Dessert Gallery. </p> <p>Selling more products through retailers other than its 378 UK stores helped boost turnover by 7% to \u00a3178.7m in the year. Profit before tax and exceptional items rose to \u00a38m from \u00a36.4m last year.</p>",
  "Ian McCartney warned his critics yesterday that their caricature of him as a likable but \"inarticulate working-class man from Glasgow who ain't that much good\" had often allowed him to get the better of people who underestimated him until it was too late. <p>In an interview with the Guardian the embattled chairman of the Labour party listed his ministerial achievements - from pension reform to the minimum wage and a major shake-up of Labour's party machine - and said he would enjoy doing whatever job Tony Blair might ask him to do next. </p> <p>\"These are all big, complex tasks. You'd never achieve them if you weren't a good communicator, and hadn't the capacity, intellectually and organisationally, to lead a team, to invoke a sense of pride in people in getting it done and achieving things. It's a big taboo, getting things done. There's a can-do attitude and a can't-do attitude,\" he said in subdued tone that was close to a whisper. </p> <p>But Mr McCartney is a self-declared optimist and soon perked up. Seated in his cabinet office room above Horseguards Parade in Whitehall he joked about barricading himself in to hang on to the view. \"I get my own Trooping of the Colour every day.\" </p> <p>He later joked about taking over as manager of Blackburn Rovers - or even England where \"an exotic accent\" is expected - if he is fired in this week's reshuffle. He carefully makes no predictions, but, despite the speculation that Alan Milburn may get his job, he will clearly be surprised if it happens. </p> <p>\"I have a long-term, sustained personal relationship with a lot of key people in the party, including Tony Blair. But I also have honest, open professional relationships with them. And when I read that Tony Blair is teed off with Ian McCartney I have a little wry smile about it,\" he said. </p> <p>Recalling that for the first five-and-a-half years of the Labour government \"the speculation was 'McCartney to join cabinet' and ever since has been 'McCartney leaving cabinet\"', he admitted that \"all of us will at some stage leave government. The issue is, on the day it happens, do you leave with some dignity? That is really up to your own conduct.\" </p> <p>It is clear that Mr McCartney does not wish to leave just yet. He does not bitch about his colleagues. But there is no masking the bitterness the 53-year-old MP for Makerfield in Lancashire feels towards those unnamed figures who indulge in what he calls \"unacceptable briefings against you on a personal basis\". </p> <p>As someone who does not do that sort of thing, he believes critics should say publicly and on the record what they whisper in private about him. \"The best way of paraphrasing it is 'an inarticulate working-class man, from Glasgow who's very liked, but ain't that much good.' You know it's a caricature too far,\" he said. </p> <p>But complaint is not the burden of the McCartney message to his party. In the 15 months he has been party chairman - after two, Charles Clarke and John Reid, came and went in quick succession - he has won credibility for the job at several levels. </p> <p>\"The post of chair had never been there before. My first task was to get credibility with party members, with outside bodies, not just unions, with international organisations. The role of party chair is now seen and accepted as a significantly important part of the political structure of the government, and the decision-making process of the government,\" says the man whose codename at the CBI (\"I have very good relations there\") is Comrade.</p> <p>The Labour movement is a coalition, he explains. You build respect by being straight. As chairman you act as a bridge, as \"an advocate for party members\" as well as an ambassador for the government. </p> <p>But he also had to reorganise the party machine, replace David Triesman with Matt Carter as general secretary (\"some painful decisions\"), develop policy in better ways than existed before the 2001 election, as well as build up Labour's new national communications headquarters in North Shields. </p> <p>\"We didn't even attempt to do communications in the last general election,\" he says. \"We'd got into government and lost the capacity to campaign in an effective way.\" Yet communications - with activists and voters - is vital if Labour is to become \"the natural party of government, not of opposition\", he insists. </p> <p>Ian McCartney is particularly proud of building a consensus behind a set of proposals he confidently expects to be the core of the likely 2005 manifesto, what he calls a \"doorstep manifesto\" because it reflects what voters say on the doorstep and in Labour's series of \"big conversations\" in which 60,000 people have taken part. </p> <p>In the long term that means devising new mechanisms for reporting back to people. He is concerned that all political parties are losing members at a time when decision-making is being devolved to the grassroots. The danger is that people will turn to community groups, not to parties, he fears. Mr McCartney's concern does not extend to the Liberal Democrats who have, he says, \"been allowed to get away with murder\" by peddling contradictory policies - \"even in the same ward\" - that have gone unchallenged. </p> <p>But his most recent concern was Labour's national policy forum in Warwick in late July, just at the time of the last attempt to oust him. \"I wanted to ensure that when we go to the party conference (next month in Brighton) there was a sense of ownership, that the party members and government had a common ownership of the policy.\" </p> <p>He believes he has succeeded, though is happy to see the Blairite policy wonks come up with bright manifesto ideas at the last minute. Defiantly proud of his accent and his background, he quips: \"I made an offer to Tony Blair that instead of job sharing with Alan Milburn I would job share with him. He said: \"I'll have to get back to you on that one.'\"</p>",
  "<p>The government blocked demands for a cap on auditors' liability yesterday, despite intense lobbying from the accountancy profession for reforms to protect the \"big four\" firms from crippling legal bills. </p> <p>Ministers said the profession had failed to make the case that liabilities arising from audit failings should be capped. </p> <p>Accountants hoped provisions for a cap on liabilities would be included in the Companies Bill, which received its second reading in the Commons yesterday. </p> <p>One of the big four, Ernst &amp; Young, said it was disappointed that auditors remained exposed to \"potentially crippling legal actions\" following a corporate collapse. The firm is fighting a \u00a32.3bn claim for damages from Equitable Life. The mutual insurer alleged that E&amp;Y's auditors were partly to blame for its near demise. </p> <p>Patricia Hewitt, the secretary of state for trade &amp; industry, told MPs that a report by the Office of Fair Trading clearly showed competition for audit work would not improve if a cap were introduced. </p> <p>She said the OFT review was crucial to her decision, though she left the way open for accountants to present proposals for individual contracts with clients to agree proportionate liability. </p> <p>Accountants welcomed the move, which was widely seen as an olive branch that could achieve the same result as a law capping liability. </p> <p>Ms Hewitt said in a statement: \"The government remains committed to improving the operation of the audit market and will continue to consider any proposals, including the possibility of limiting liability on a proportionate basis by contract, which can be demonstrated significantly to enhance competition, and to improve quality in the audit market.\" </p> <p>Proportionate liability, which has been introduced in Canada and Australia, prevents auditors from being sued for more than the loss that a court deems is a result of their alleged negligence. </p> <p>Ms Hewitt was believed to back a cap on liabilities but was prevented from including it in the bill after the intervention of the Treasury. She is believed to fear that a major corporate collapse could result in one of the big four going out of business. Accountants fear a repeat of the collapse of Arthur Andersen after the Enron debacle two years ago. </p> <p>However, it is understood that chancellor Gordon Brown felt it was politically unacceptable to offer auditors further legal protection.</p>",

The hunting debate/debacle sums up much that is vacuous, moronic and putrid about British political life.\" </p> <p><b> Peter Oborne </b><br> Evening Standard, London, September 6</p> <p> \"Tony Blair... means to allow Labour's enormous Commons majority to torment a section of society - ordinary country folk - which they despise... I have never hunted and a ban will not affect me. But there is something horrible, vindictive and cowardly about the government's plan to ban hunting before the end of this session...</p> <p>\"It is an abuse of parliament. This intolerant and ignorant attack on a small minority does not only shame Mr Blair, it shames Britain. Fox-hunting people are not terrorists. Mr Blair should not treat them as if they were.\"</p> <p><b> Lembit Opik</b><br> Daily Telegraph, September 7</p> <p> \"I don't hunt. I don't own a horse or a red riding jacket, and I don't like jodhpurs... [But] as a libertarian, and someone committed to evidence-based decision-making, I firmly believe there must be a very good reason to ban anything...</p> <p>\"I haven't heard a single sensible reason why a ban on hunting, infringing the freedom of thousands of people, should be imposed... If animal welfare would be improved... that might be persuasive... [But] animal welfare organisations have been singularly unable to show that a ban will even reduce the suffering of the fox.\"</p> <p> Lembit Opik is a Liberal Democrat MP </p> <p><b> Financial Times </b><br> Editorial, September 7</p> <p> \"The real target [of the ban] is not the hunting fraternity, but the Labour activists whose support will be essential in the general election campaign. A ban might win back their hearts and minds, alienated by health and education reforms that attempt to replace one- size-fits-all provision with public services tailored to individual needs. </p> <p>\"Meanwhile, more important issues must be shelved until after the general election, expected in the first half of next year.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Mirror</b><br> Editorial, September 6</p> <p> \"Hunting arouses more passion than almost any other subject... Mr Blair knows he is in real trouble whatever he does. If he doesn't push through the ban, there will be a massive rebellion on his backbenches. If he does, he will spark a backlash in the countryside and a constitutional crisis in the House of Lords. He doesn't really have an option, though. He has to do it and he knows it. The last thing he needs with an election so near is his party in open revolt.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Mail</b><br> Editorial, September 6</p> <p> \"Iraq is in the grip of anarchy. Our health and education services are... woefully inadequate. And constitutional reform remains a shambles. So what does Mr Blair do? Why, revive a ban on fox hunting... Time and again he has reached for anti-hunt legislation when his backbenchers get angry or cabinet members become bolshy... It speaks volumes that a decision to force through a measure that will affect many thousands of jobs is decided not on principle, but at the political convenience of the prime minister.\"</p>",
  "<b> Steve Richards </b> <br> Independent, September 7 <p> \"The political season opens with a cabinet resignation. Andrew Smith may not have been a household name, and his brief, work and pensions, was not the most glamorous... Even so, this is a messy development for Tony Blair at best, and could turn out to be more significant and damaging than that...</p> <p>\"Mr Smith chose to go early, creating a further sense of reshuffle chaos, rather than cooperate with Mr Blair and offer to resign when he announced other ministerial changes... Mr Blair's reshuffles are now chaotic affairs...</p> <p>\"Mr Smith was a New Labour figure, but from a Brownite perspective... New Labour is now split into at least two different camps, with policy differences in some cases as important as the inevitable tensions over personalities and conflicting ambitions. The most important divide in British politics is not between New and old Labour, but between those who all regarded themselves as New in 1997... This is not the start to a new political term that Mr Blair would have wanted.\"</p> <p><b> Evening Standard </b> <br> Editorial, London, September 7</p> <p> \"The resignation may have left [the Gordon] Brown camp weaker. The prime minister, reinvigorated and determined to begin the political autumn on his own terms, had been planning a reshuffle. Mr Smith's departure now gives him a freer hand... He has the rest of the reshuffle to establish his message - that the next election will be fought on his own terms and a distinctly Blairite agenda. The response of the chancellor... will tell us whether we are set for another outburst of the feud at the heart of New Labour.\" </p> <p><b> Robert Shrimsley </b><br> Financial Times, September 7</p> <p> \"Poor Mr Smith... the latest victim of his department's failure to get to grips with the savings, pensions and housing benefit problems. </p> <p>\"Few voters will notice his departure, for the likable Mr Smith was one of the most uncharismatic figures ever to reach cabinet... He only ever uttered one memorable phrase ('our air is not for sale') and that turned out to be wrong. On that occasion he was let down by the chancellor, who changed his mind on privatising the National Air Traffic Services to cover up a supposed black hole in his figures. It was merely the first time Mr Brown would leave his slavishly loyal colleague swinging. Mr Smith is taking the fall for policy failures in a department which is little more than a district office of the Treasury.\" </p> <p><b> Stephen Glover </b> <br>Daily Mail, September 7</p> <p> \"The prime minister has again aggravated the Brownites by proposing to appoint [the former health minister] Alan Milburn, a loyal Blairite, to the chairmanship of the Labour party... Mr Milburn's prospective appointment has shaken Brownites to their gunnels. Here is a man who fought skirmish after skirmish with Mr Brown, principally over the issue of ... foundation hospitals. To appoint such a man to the chairmanship of the party, where he will mastermind Labour's election strategy, is both a snub to the chancellor and an indication of Mr Blair's renewed confidence. Shunted aside in the reshuffle will be the existing Labour party chairman, Ian McCartney... who is liked by the Brownites and is also... the particular pet of John Prescott, the deputy prime minister...</p> <p>\"There are [also] mutterings among Blairites against Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, who has committed the cardinal sin of not being a complete and unquestioning Blair loyalist every minute of his day. He is even suspected - as though he were some deviant member of the old Soviet Politburo - of harbouring sympathies for Mr Brown. He will be a marked man, as others even more exalted than he may be marked, if Mr Blair leads New Labour with a thumping majority to a triumphant third term.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Star </b><br> Editorial, September 7</p> <p> \"Mr Blair appears to be losing control of his government. [He] has barely spoken to Mr Straw for six months. And [now]... Mr Smith walked out. All of a sudden, Mr Blair's government is once again in a mess. He needs a cabinet reshuffle - fast...</p> <p>\"Mr Blair simply doesn't trust the foreign secretary any more. He believes Mr Straw is plotting with Mr Brown to overthrow him... If Mr Blair has got this right, he should go further and actually sack the foreign secretary. Because otherwise, he looks weak - and ripe for being plucked from power.\"</p> <p><b> Rachel Sylvester </b> <br>Daily Telegraph, September 6</p> <p> \"Mr Blair has become increasingly suspicious of the foreign secretary's political ambitions. No 10 believes Mr Straw has formed an increasingly close alliance with Mr Brown. Over issues as diverse as ID cards and Europe, he has sided with the chancellor, rather than the prime minister. There is even speculation that he could become deputy leader under a Brown premiership...</p> <p>\"But... Mr Straw does not have a following on the Labour benches, which makes it unlikely that he would, if sacked, be able to precipitate the prime minister's downfall, as Geoffrey Howe did after he was sacked by Margaret Thatcher... Barbara Castle once said she had hired the young Mr Straw as her special adviser because she admired his 'guile and low cunning'. He will need all he can get of both in the next few months if he wants to survive.\"</p>"
