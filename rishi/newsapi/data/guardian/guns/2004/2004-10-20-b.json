  "An elderly farmer has been gored to death by a rutting stag, police said yesterday and a second man suffered serious injuries when he attempted to go to the aid of his friend. <p>The dead man was discovered at Moor Farm at Hunmanby Gap, near Filey, North Yorkshire, on Monday night, at an enclosure where deer were being kept during the mating season, when they usually become aggressive and unpredictable.</p> <p>Two farmers had arrived at the enclosure to look for 73-year-old Clifford Colling, from Filey, who owned the herd.</p> <p>One of the men was also attacked by a stag and sustained serious head, leg and arm injuries as he attempted to help Mr Colling. The stag was later shot dead by a police marksman.</p> <p>Hugh Rose, technical adviser to the British Deer Society, said attacks on humans were not uncommon during the breeding season, which runs from the end of September to late October. </p> <p>\"It happens every year,\" he said. \"Farmers are well aware of the risks of entering an enclosure during the rutting season. The stags stop eating and their testosterone levels shoot through the roof.</p> <p>\"They become very frustrated and very aggressive and take it out on trees and bushes - anything that's in their way. The problem is that for the rest of the year, the stags are big gormless lumps you can stroke on the head and feed carrots to.</p> <p>\"Then they transform into these mad animals, foaming at the mouth, who are trying to kill each other.</p> <p>\"I think perhaps farmers forget their docile friends can turn on them too. They are extremely unreliable and dangerous animals.\"</p> <p>He said farmers should not enter deer enclosures during the breeding season unless they were in a vehicle.</p> <p>The injured man was taken to Scarborough general hospital for treatment.</p> <p>The North Yorkshire coroner has been informed of Mr Colling's death and a post-mortem examination is to be carried out today.</p> <p>A North Yorkshire police spokesman said: \"Paramedics were called, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene.</p> <p>Attacks by wild deer are relatively rare, according to the British Association for Shooting and Conservation. \"On the whole in the wild, deer are much more shy of man than farmed deer,\" said a BASC spokesman. \"It is not a problem we have heard of anywhere in the wild.\"</p> <p>Another problem involving deer is that they run the risk of being killed or injured on Britain's roads. Earlier this month, it emerged that up to 50,000 deer are hurt or killed in road accidents each year. The accidents also lead to 10 human deaths a year.</p>",
  "In a panel accompanying a report about the possibility of devolution for the north-east of England, page 13, October 15, we said a regional assembly would \"get up to \u00a330m a year, mostly from the government\". That referred to running costs. Any assembly, according to a recent government booklet delivered to every household, would \"directly control spending of around \u00a3500m, mostly from government grant\". <p>In a leading article, Increase the density, page 29, October 15, we described John Prescott as a north-east MP. His constituency is Hull East, outside the north-east region. </p> <p>In Leaked report damns passive smoking, page 7, yesterday, we quoted the general secretary of the TUC saying: \"Half-measures will not save the 700 employers who die every year due to passive smoking at work.\" What she actually said was \"700 employees\". </p> <p>In a report headed Cartons consign tinned food to scrapheap, page 3, October 16, we said the new Tetra Paks were easier for the industry to distribute - \"for every 16 lorries needed for cylindrical tin cans, just one lorry is needed [for] the equivalent in rectangular cartons\". We should have explained that this is because the new paperboard packs can be taken to the factory flatpacked for filling. They also save space when filled but clearly not that much. </p> <p>The former Enron finance director to whom we meant to refer in Judge backs extradition of NatWest bankers, page 26, October 16, is Andrew Fastow, not Falstow. </p> <p>In Pastries make patsies of Eccles, page 1, October 18, we described Elizabeth Raffald as \"the owner of a confectioner's shop in Arley Hall in Cheshire\". In fact, Mrs Raffald was housekeeper at Arley Hall, a country house, before marrying the gardener and moving. It was only then that she opened a confectioner's shop and published her famous cookery book (The Experienced English Housekeeper, with \"near 800 original receipts\"). </p> <p>Barney Kessel, the jazz musician, who died at the age of 80 in June this year, accidentally appeared in the Birthdays column, page 25, October 16.

  "<p>Britain's second largest drugs firm, AstraZeneca, is being sued by two pensioners' groups in the United States who claim its ulcer drug, Nexium, is no better than its older and now cheaper product, Prilosec. </p> <p>The lawsuit says vast amounts spent on advertising and marketing persuaded pensioners to buy Nexium when they could have saved money by buying Prilosec. The view that Nexium is no better, or little better than Prilosec, is commonly held in the industry. The active ingredient in the two drugs, called esomeprazole and omeprazole respectively, are almost identical. </p> <p>The suit, brought by American groups the Congress of California Seniors and California Alliance for Retired Americans, calls for the return of all profits from the sale of Nexium. </p> <p>High drug prices in the US are a hot political issue and the industry is nervous about any price controls being imposed because the country provides most of its profits. </p> <p>Prilosec, \"the purple pill\", was once the best-selling drug in the world, with revenues of about $6bn (\u00a33.3bn) a year. This was a large part of AZ's revenue, so when the company faced losing its right to produce it exclusively at a high price in 2000, it was a major issue for the firm. </p> <p>When a company brings a drug to market it can do so exclusively for a set period, but after it loses its patent, generic drug firms can muscle in. While the drug is in patent the company charges much more than the manufacturing cost to recoup its spending on research and clinical trials, but the price falls when competition is introduced. </p> <p>The suit describes the firm's strategy to reduce the impact, dubbed the shark's fin project because of the shape the sales graph would be if the firm could not find a way to mitigate the loss of Prilosec sales. </p> <p>It says AZ bombarded doctors with promotional material and used \"flawed\" clinical trial results to promote the drug to patients with an unusually large advertising and marketing campaign, stating that Nexium was better than Prilosec. This has been successful and Nexium had sales of $3.3bn last year. </p> <p>The lawsuit quotes the price of Nexium at $4 a pill now, against Prilosec's 46 cents. According to research firm Wood Mackenzie, last year AZ spent $257m on advertising Nexium, more than on any other drug. </p> <p>\"There are clearly differences with Nexium and Prilosec: Nexium has demonstrated better acid control and better healing of acid-related damage,\" said a spokesman for AZ.</p>",
  "Mounting racism and anti-semitism in France represent \"a radical threat to the survival of our democratic system\", according to a government-commissioned report presented to the interior ministry yesterday. <p>The 50-page report by Jean-Christophe Rufin, a humanitarian aid specialist turned bestselling novelist, said \"a specific armoury\" was urgently needed to fight the growing risk of racist and anti-semitic sentiments giving birth to \"organised political forces\". </p> <p>The interior minister, Dominique de Villepin, said the police had recorded 123 racist attacks and 294 threats in France in the first nine months of 2004, as well as 166 anti-semitic attacks and 584 threats. The totals were higher than for the whole of last year and were \"utterly unacceptable in a country like ours\", he said. </p> <p>Mr Rufin, who based his conclusions on police data and a large number of interviews, said that contrary to popular belief the majority of anti-semitic acts in France were not carried out by supporters of the far right and disaffected youths of north African origin. </p> <p>\"Anti-semitic acts are the work of a far more diverse group of French people who use Jews as their scapegoats,\" said Mr Rufin, who is a former vice-president of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res and Goncourt prize-winning novelist. </p> <p>\"Attacks and threats against French Jews are a social phenomenon at once new, evident and extremely preoccupying.\" </p> <p>France, which likes to portray itself as the cradle of human rights, is highly embarrassed by the recent sharp rise in anti-semitic and racist acts. Aside from regular instances of desecration of cemeteries and swastika graffiti on Jewish property, offences have in cluded firebombings of synagogues and verbal abuse in schools. </p> <p>The country is home to western Europe's biggest Jewish and Muslim communities - around 600,000 Jews, and an estimated 5 million Muslims. Last month President Jacques Chirac made a stirring national appeal for racial and religious tolerance as part of a campaign against attacks, which he said were \"spreading insidiously\". </p> <p>Mr de Villepin welcomed Mr Rufin's report, saying it was a \"personal but extremely useful contribution\" to a crucial debate, and that its conclusions \"deserve to be studied very carefully indeed\". </p> <p>Mr Rufin said the evidence showed that most people found guilty of anti-semitic acts in France shared common characteristics, such as a \"lack of bearings, a rootlessness, a loss of identity, a sense of social frustration and failure, a disintegrated family\". </p> <p>Pronounced anti-Zionism amounted to a form of anti-semitism and should be equally reprimanded, he said. \"Anti-Zionism legitimises the Palestinian armed struggle even when it targets innocent civilians,\" he said. \"Thus it could also legitimise violent acts committed in France. By the same token, accusations of racism, apartheid and nazism against Israel could by extension put France's own Jewish population in danger.\" </p> <p>Among possible ways forward, Mr Rufin urged legislation specifically targeting anti-semitic and racist acts. French law generally views racial motivation as an aggravating factor in an attack, not as an offence in itself. The public expression of anti-semitic or racist views or insults is covered only by the highly complex and unwieldy 1881 Press Act. </p> <p>\"This was an act designed to promote and defend the freedom of expression,\" Mr Rufin said. \"It is completely unsuited to the job it is now called on to do.\" </p> <p>He called for enforceable regulations to combat racism and anti-semitism in schools, including at primary level; \"clearer, more complete and more transparent figures\" to allow for international comparisons; and evidence of how many cases were successfully prosecuted. Mr Rufin also recommended the foundation of a National Observatory on Racism and Anti-Semitism, and said special vigilance was needed in media broadcasts. </p> <p>He said it was \"extremely difficult\" to be precise about racism - as distinct from anti-semitism - in France because of the \"wide variety of its forms of expression\" and the fact that \"the very foundations of the French republican model forbid citizens from being distinguished according to ethnic or religious criteria\". </p> <p>He added, however, that most racist violence, as opposed to discrimination, was the work of small minority groups acting in accordance with a warped ideology. On Corsica, which accounts for half of all racially-motivated violence in France, locals explain their treatment of north African immigrants as \"a fight against crime and drug trafficking\", Mr Rufin said.</p>",
  "A French couple who allowed a friend to drive home drunk after a dinner party were found not guilty yesterday of partial responsibility for a car crash in which he killed himself and four others. <p>Jean-S\u00e9bastien and Ang\u00e9lique Fraysse faced charges of failing to prevent a crime involving bodily harm, after allowing their guest, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Colin, 29, to drive home after a night of heavy drinking in February 2000.</p> <p>After leaving their flat in Maizi\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Metz, Moselle, in eastern France, he drove three miles down the wrong side of a main road before hitting another car head-on and killing himself and a couple and two of their three children.</p> <p>The case was brought by the grandmother of the only surviving child, now nine, who claimed that Mr and Mrs Fraysse should have done more to stop their guest from driving, and could at least have called the police when he insisted in getting in the car.</p> <p>The lawyer for victims' family said that even if the Fraysses were not \"responsible they were still guilty\" and asked the court to punish them to set an example and avert future accidents. But the public prosecutor recommended acquittal, arguing it would not be desirable to set a legal precedent requiring people to inform on their friends and stressing that there was a difference between moral behaviour and the law. \"There is no legal obligation to denounce,\" Michel Senthille told the court. In their defence, Mr and Mrs Fraysse told the court that they had tried to stop their friend from driving, suggesting that he spend the night, hiding his car keys and trying to block his way out of their flat, until he became aggressive and they gave up. </p> <p>Their lawyer said they had done \"everything they could in the circumstances\" and the prosecution recognised that they had made a positive effort to prevent him from getting behind the wheel.</p> <p>Mrs Fraysse, 29, who was herself run over by a drink-driver when she was 16 and is now paraplegic, said she felt \"happy and relieved\" after the judgment was read out at the court in Nancy. She and her husband faced a prison sentence of up to five years or \u20ac75,000 (\u00a350,000) fines had they been found guilty. \"I wasn't responsible and the law has proved it,\" she said. \"It is the end of a nightmare. This has been going on for four years. You can imagine the pressure that we've been under.\"</p> <p>Bar owners in France can be held legally responsible if they allow a drunken customer to drive.</p>",
  "The attempt to discredit John Kerry among his fellow Catholics intensified yesterday when a rightwing activist claimed to have Vatican support for his excommunication. <p>The claim, although immediately dismissed by the Vatican authorities, steps up a campaign by conservative Catholics to punish Mr Kerry for his support for abortion rights and stem cell research. </p> <p>He is the first Catholic to seek the presidency since John F Kennedy, and his candidacy has angered rightwing religious forces who see his liberal outlook as a threat. </p> <p>\"Whenever the Democratic party nominates a Catholic it is a godsend, because otherwise the abortion issue is secondary,\" said Father Richard McBrien, a theologian at Notre Dame University. </p> <p>\"If it weren't for Kerry being a Catholic, these people would have no platform.\" </p> <p>The activist, Marc Balestrieri, produced a letter from a Dominican priest in Washington yesterday which he said represented official Vatican support. </p> <p>Mr Balestrieri, who claims to be an expert in canon law and to have served as a consultant to the archdiocese of Los Angeles, has been given a wide hearing in the press, but the archdiocese said yesterday that his service had been limited to ghostwriting a few documents on marriage. </p> <p>The Vatican said he had misrepresented both his contacts with church authorities and the official weight of the letter. </p> <p>Mr Balestrieri, who founded an organisation last June with the express purpose of seeking Mr Kerry's excommunication, was unrepentant. \"It is a mis-statement of the facts,\" he told the Guardian. \"They are covering their backs. They do not want to take responsibility for what is the true teaching of the faith.\" </p> <p>Although Mr Kerry is in no immediate danger of excommunication he can expect intensifying opposition from Catholic conservatives. </p> <p>About a quarter of voters are Catholic and they are heavily represented in battleground states. More than half are believed to support legalised abortion, and the community generally leans towards the Democratic party. </p> <p>But traditionalists have been courted by President George Bush, whose opposition to abortion and stem cell research gives him an advantage with clergy as well as churchgoers, and it will be hard work prising them from the Republican camp, especially since a number of prominent church leaders have voiced their opposition to Mr Kerry. </p> <p>Earlier this year nine bishops said they would deny him communion for his support of abortion rights and on the past two Sundays there have been calls from the pulpit in several battleground states to shun candidates who support abortion rights and stem cell research. </p> <p>\"There is no element of the common good, no morally good practice, that a candidate may promote and to which a voter may be dedicated, which could justify voting for a candidate who also endorses and supports the deliberate killing of the innocent, abortion, embryonic stem-cell research, euthanasia, human cloning or the recognition of a same-sex relationship as legal marriage,\" Raymond Burke, Archbishop of St Louis, Missouri, said in a pastoral letter. </p> <p>The bishops of Newark, Denver and Colorado Springs and clerics in Michigan, Wisconsin and elsewhere have issued similar instructions.</p>",
  "Early voting in the US election has been beset by computer hang-ups, two-hour queues, frayed tempers, and the resignation of at least one election official. <p>Voting ground to a halt in three Florida counties after the laptops used to check voter information stopped connecting to a central database. </p> <p>Many polling locations had only one phone line dedicated to the purpose, and voters reported hi-tech electronic voting machines standing unused while queues formed at the laptops. </p> <p>Early voting, which also began this week in Arkansas, Texas and Colorado, is intended in part to prevent long delays on election day. </p> <p>But in larger Floridian cities, including Miami and Tampa, waits of between two and three hours were reported, causing anger among voters. </p> <p>\"I've been a supervisor for 33 years and this is the worst I've ever seen it,\" Theresa LePore of Palm Beach County, told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. </p> <p>\"We are going to be doing this for two weeks. But everyone had to show up on the first day, and then complained because they had to stand in line.\" </p> <p>In Florida's most populous county, Duval, the elections supervisor resigned, blaming health problems, while Ms LePore said poll volunteers had also threatened to quit. </p> <p>Duval also succumbed to pressure to open more early-voting sites - just one had been made available - but only after governor Jeb Bush added his voice to criticisms from black church leaders. </p> <p>Mr Bush's secretary of state, Glenda Hood, continues to be embroiled in legal battles with Democrats accusing her office of pursuing policies that could exclude people from voting. </p> <p>Late on Monday the state supreme court awarded Ms Hood a victory when it ruled that provisional ballots, designed to allow the possibility of a vote to those who find themselves missing from the rolls, could only be cast in the voter's home precinct. </p> <p>Lawyers for the opposing side have argued that the authorities often direct voters to the wrong precinct. </p> <p>In Texas, President Bush received two early votes yesterday from a constituency that has not required much campaigning effort on his part: his parents.</p>",
  "<p>The struggling channel tunnel operator, Eurotunnel, has revealed that its trading was damaged over the summer holidays by the arrival of a cut-price ferry firm dubbed the \"easyJet of the seas\". </p> <p>Eurotunnel's operating revenue slipped 4% to \u00a3140m in the three months to September. The drop marked a deterioration against a weak summer last year, when the Iraq war deterred global travel. </p> <p>The French-led management team which seized control of Eurotunnel in April said passenger volumes were damaged by budget airlines and by the arrival of SpeedFerries, founded by Danish entrepreneur Curt Stavis. </p> <p>SpeedFerries is using a former Australian naval catamaran to carry passengers between Dover and Boulogne for as little as \u00a350 return. </p> <p>The number of cars using Eurotunnel's shuttles fell by 5% to 605,984, even though the overall cross-channel passenger market declined only 1%. </p> <p>The number of trucks fell by 4% to 302,445 against a freight market which expanded by 8%. </p> <p>Chief executive Jean-Louis Raymond accepted that the figures were \"obviously not satisfactory\" but blamed his predecessors, who were ejected by shareholders at a rancorous annual meeting in Paris six months ago. </p> <p>Mr Raymond said: \"These figures demonstrate that Eurotunnel's previous strategy was not adjusted to market trends in terms of capacity and pricing.\" </p> <p>Eurotunnel shares fell 1.25p to 20.5p. The setback came at a bad time for the board, which has to provide its bankers, HSBC and Credit Lyonnais, with a three-year business plan by the end of this month. Eurotunnel has debts of \u00a36.4bn. Its lenders have indicated that if they are dissatisfied with the business plan, they could take steps towards seizing control of the business. </p> <p>Creditors are sceptical about Eurotunnel's unorthodox new board, which includes a right-wing French MP, Pierre Cardo, and a former JP Morgan banker, Herv\u00e9 Huas, who is under investigation for money laundering. </p> <p>Eurotunnel's access fees from Eurostar and freight train operators edged up by 2% to \u00a358.8m. Revenue from its shuttles dropped 8% to \u00a377.7m. The channel tunnel operator intends to streamline its pricing structure, which at present offers a complex mixture of 18 or 19 different tariffs. It is yet to reveal the details of its new strategy. </p> <p>Industry experts said the only positive figure was a 7% rise in rail freight through the tunnel. \"These are not brilliant results,\" said one credit analyst. \"The new competitor in the shuttle business is the last thing they need. The Eurostar freight news is one crumb of comfort.\"</p>",
  "<p>There was much talk at Stamford Bridge yesterday of being professional. It will dictate Chelsea's approach to this evening's game against CSKA Moscow, a match which will arouse unique emotions in several people at the club, albeit only the Russians. But it will always be expected of each member of their team, as the club comes to terms with Adrian Mutu's fall from grace. </p> <p>While Jose Mourinho's control over his players ends at the gates of Chelsea Village, he clearly expects to influence their behaviour at all times.</p> <p>\"I think a professional player has to be aware of what he can do, what he should do,\" he said. \"I think a man, I can say a boy, of 20 years of age is always a man of 20 years of age. If he is a football player, if he is a student, he's always a man of 20, with the same kind of needs, with the same kind of desires, with the same kind of influences. But the question is what they can do, and a football player has to know.</p> <p>\"I'm the manager of a group of 24 men. I don't know what all of them are doing outside their professional life. It is impossible to do it. But when I see my team work every day, when I see the enthusiasm, the commitment, I can only believe that they are top, top pros and give everything.\"</p> <p>Mourinho will certainly expect such commitment this evening, with qualification for the Champions League's knock-out stages the reward for victory and a bitter first defeat of the season, by Manchester City on Saturday, to erase from the memory.</p> <p>If CSKA are in need of encouragement, it is to be found in Chelsea's misfiring attack. With their top scorer Didier Drogba still four weeks from returning from a groin operation and Mutu also absent, they have only two fit forwards. Of those Eidur Gudjohnsen last scored for them on the opening day of the season and Mateja Kezman has not scored since a summer move from PSV Eindhoven.</p> <p>Moscow's other source of encouragement will be the directors' box, where Roman Abramovich will have more than national pride to blame for the belief that an upset might not be a total disaster.</p> <p>Chelsea's owner is also the major shareholder in Sibneft, the oil company which sponsors CSKA's shirts for \u00a310m a season. Uefa investigated the potential conflict of interest only to decide last month that there was no reason for the sides not to play.</p> <p>\"We will prepare for this match like every other game we play,\" CSKA's head coach Valeriy Gazzaev said last night. \"It is nothing special, though obviously we have a lot of respect for Roman Abramovich; he is one of our club's main sponsors.\"</p> <p>Mourinho's main worry will be the form of Vagner Love, the Brazilian whose goals have put CSKA top of the Russian league, by one point with four games to play.

  "<p>Claude Anelka, the brother and agent of Manchester City's French striker Nicolas, has left Raith Rovers after a miserable five-month spell as a director and head coach of the Scottish First Division club. </p> <p>Anelka was appointed to the dual role in May, investing around \u00a3300,000 in the club, but has been heavily criticised by fans as the team failed to win a match since the start of the season. Rovers are bottom of the table following one draw and nine defeats from their first 10 league games and face a struggle to avoid relegation. </p> <p>\"It has been very hard to listen to the abuse and jeering that the fans showered upon me, week in, week out,\" Anelka said. \"It is understandable that they are upset through the lack of results and performance of our team.\" </p> <p>The former Rovers player Gordon Dalziel has replaced Anelka as manager. He has said he will release several of the players brought in by the Frenchman during the close season in order to try to arrest the slump. </p> <p>Anelka said that he wanted his money to be used to help develop younger players at the troubled club, whose finest hour came when they defeated Celtic to win the 1994 League Cup final. </p> <p>Heart of Midlothian's prospective new owner Vladimir Romanov has moved to assure the head coach Craig Levein that the transfer and selection of players will be solely down to him. </p> <p>The Lithuanian businessman has reached agreement with the chief executive Chris Robinson for his shares and is negotiating with the former chairman Leslie Deans for his stake in the club. </p> <p>But Romanov has already expressed his desire to bring Anatoly Byshovets to the club as a \"sporting director\" as part of the ownership package. </p> <p>That sparked fears that the current Tynecastle coach Levein, who has earned plaudits for his handling of the team in difficult financial circumstances since his arrival from Cowdenbeath four years ago, would be pushed to one side. </p> <p>However, Romanov insists, through a spokesman, that the Hearts manager will still have the \"final say\" if Byshovets joins the club. </p> <p>Romanov's spokesman, Mindaugas Majauskas, told the Edinburgh Evening News: \"Mr Byshovets is a consultant of Mr Romanov regarding football issues in all clubs. Regarding Hearts, the final say regarding transfers or player selection is with Craig Levein.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Romanov maintains that his interest in FBK Kaunas will not have any impact on Hearts' future involvement in Europe. </p> <p>Uefa, the game's European governing body, has strict rules regarding the involvement of individuals in separate clubs in the same competition. Romanov is a founder and board member of the Lithuanian club but believes the decision to allow Chelsea and CSKA Moscow to compete against each other in the Champions League, despite common interest from Roman Abramovich, vindicates his position. </p> <p>Majauskas said: \"According to Lithuanian law FBK is a public institution. Mr Romanov is one of the founders of the club, a board member and also a sponsor. </p> <p>\"There was a similar case in Uefa when the same person was both a sponsor of one club and a shareholder of another one. Then, there were no problems so we think that there should not be problems in this case.\" Reuters</p>",
  "<p>Sebastian Deisler, the talented but troubled Bayern Munich midfielder, may have to check back into the psychiatric clinic where he has previously undergone treatment for depression. </p> <p>Deisler, who had travelled to Turin with the Bayern squad prior to last night's Champions League tie against Juventus, abruptly left the club's hotel late on Monday night and returned to Munich. </p> <p>\"He ate with the team and then went to his room,\" Bayern's general manager Dieter Hoeness said, adding that not long afterwards Deisler telephoned him. \"He said, 'I'm not feeling well and would like to go back',\" Hoeness said. </p> <p>Deisler checked into a Munich clinic in November 2003 and spent almost two months there undergoing treatment for depression. He began training again in February but was late in returning to prepare for the new season. </p> <p>He had a good start to the current campaign and was recalled to the German national team. But his form has slipped in recent games and he was substituted at half-time in Bayern's 1-0 defeat by Schalke 04 on Saturday. </p> <p>The Germany coach Oliver Bierhoff promised support for Deisler. \"We are going to wait for him,\" he said. \"With support, he will come back.\" </p> <p>Police in Sweden have expressed concern about escalating violence among supporters following a riot during Monday night's Stockholm derby between AIK Solna and Hammerby. </p> <p>Trouble flared when dozens of AIK supporters tried to invade the pitch. The game was suspended for 45 minutes as police officers sprayed the rioters with fire extinguishers to force them back. </p> <p>Before the game police found 26 home-made Molotov cocktails, believed to belong to the AIK fans, in a nearby park. A female police officer in another area of the city was hit on the head by a glass bottle as about a hundred fans fought in a pre-arranged brawl.</p>",
  "<p>I knew we'd made the transition into holiday mood the day my second youngest - hereafter referred to as Boy, 6 - went off on his own and disappeared. OK, some of us went looking for him: his sisters Girl, 8 and Girl, 2, and his Mummy, 42, to be precise. But although Boy, 6 was gone for nearly an hour the search party felt no need to drag his grown-up sister Girl, 20, from the pool or to disturb his big brother, Boy, 13 and his Daddy, 46, as they hacked their way round the pitch and putt. And when eventually Boy, 6, was discovered routing an older girl at draughts and eating her Jammie Dodgers at the same time, it confirmed all I have learned about the type of holiday that suits my large, unwieldy family best. For maximum fun with minimum anxiety, nothing beats a big campsite in France.</p> <p>This was the biggest we've yet stayed on. Thanks to the mad late August weather it was the wettest too. But we are well-hardened to that, and when you've slogged through the endless barrios of south London in your tatty MPV, survived the lurch and judder of the cross-Channel ferry, fathomed the automated check-in at the staff-free motel in a Cherbourg strip development where we stopped overnight, and arrived at your destination bearing carrier bags of vomit and with your knickers full of crisps, it takes more than a few life-threatening downpours to put you off.</p> <p>We have two summer vacation golden rules. The first is to splash out on a mobile home rather than settle for a tent. A fortnight under canvas may build character if you're a small nuclear unit whose personnel don't mind rising at dead of night to dig emergency drainage trenches and will tramp to the toilet block and back without an entourage of parents and soft toys. But we are not that lucky or that daft. If you include the concealed fold-out beneath the communal banquette you can sleep eight in a big mobile, plus there's a shower and a cooker and a fridge. Obliging Eurocamp reps come round to check your gas bottles and replace the Kitchen Devil that the last occupants nicked. It's a palace on breeze blocks really and makes camping feel more royal than roughing it. [Click <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/activities/camping/story/0,12697,1331018,00.html\">here</a> for the opposite view]</p> <p>The second golden rule is to have bikes. In previous years we've rented, usually from a supplier on the site. This, though, can prove expensive so this time we brought our own. My Heath Robinson approach to fixing them to the car prompted eye-rolling exchanges among members of the loading crew at Portsmouth harbour, but this humiliation was more than justified by the eventual rewards. </p> <p>Within minutes of our locating our new, temporary home Boy, 13, Girl, 8 and, of course, Boy, 6 had pedalled away to explore the varied facets of Camping Les Ormes, pedalo pond, astro-turf football pitch, sporadic mounds of pony poo and all. For urban-dwellers like us it is a serious joy to feel relaxed about the kids cycling off whenever they please and thinking of it as just part of being free if they have trouble finding their way home. </p> <p>Les Ormes is about two hours' drive from Cherbourg and five minutes from the pleasantly aged market town of Dol-de-Bretagne. With a golf course forming part of the wider development, it's not surprising that the site is rich in facilities relating to having good walks spoiled. As well as the five-hole pitch-and-putt course, there's a driving range where dogged beginners such as Boy, 13, can swish and swear to their hearts' content. There's crazy golf too although, as is too often the case with this most challenging of sports, it was the one facility not beautifully maintained. Those of us who take our crazy golf seriously would like to see statutory minimum standards applied - a job for the European Commission, possibly. That said, the disconcerting discovery that entire miniature castles could be back heeled long distances down the carpeted fairways did not deter Boy, 6, from spending several happy hours there, scorecard and pencil stub clutched hotly in hand.</p> <p>Girl, 8, meanwhile, pursed her traditional dual holiday interests: swimming and finding friends. Les Ormes offers two sorts of pool experience. Three small ones are tucked together in a quiet corner, while the heart of the site contains a large \"adventure\" leisure affair complete with waterfalls and slides and a dedicated toddler area where Daddy, 46, and Mummy, 42, took turns to stand shivering while Girl, 2, splashed and shrieked and, on one memorable occasion, released a mighty stream of wee from the top of the baby slide. </p> <p>By contrast, Girl, 8, explored every square millilitre sometimes with Girl, 20, often alone or with whichever new friend she'd hooked up with that day. One of the joys of campsite residence is that it offers the security and captive community that in our folk imaginations we associate with village life. Girl, 8, seeks out potential friends with unerring accuracy and if they turn out to be even half the water baby she is, not much short of a harpoon will get her back on dry land before dusk.</p> <p>For older members of our party there were more adult attractions - or more infantile, depending on your point of view. Paintball was the best example, patronised mostly, though not exclusively, by medium-sized boys and grown men who Should Know Better. Our first battle became a farce when the heavens suddenly opened creating such helpless confusion that Daddy, 46, gave genuine, heartfelt thanks for having been born too late for Passchendaele. Subsequent battles were, well, drier at any rate, and especially memorable for a kamikaze foray by Mummy, 42, who perished in a shower of Day-Glo orange blobs but then rose from the dead consoled by the knowledge that her sacrifice had helped others survive.</p> <p>Having a wide variety of children requires an equally wide variety of things to do. This was handsomely provided: for Boy, 13, an elaborate \"adventure challenge\" journey through the tree-tops involving rope ladders, ziplines, and a rope-and-plank bridge across a lake which he has yet to be forgiven for deliberately wobbling when it was the turn of Daddy, 46, to cross it; for Girl, 2, a tiny pony called Bubblegum who wouldn't do what he was told; for Girl, 8, and Girl 20, the after dark delights of the watching the less self-effacing reps perform the hits from Guys and Dolls.</p> <p>We found time, though, to make day trips too: to the famous Mont St Michel, an ancient church-atop-a-hillside-town which looks from a distance to be floating on the sea; to the sea food mecca of Concale; and to the walled port of St Malo where we colonised a corner of a vaguely demi monde cafe where young men kissed each other, the kids sat on high stools sipping Coke through straws and the older grown ups fantasised that they were Mummy, 21, and Daddy, 22. </p> <p>Closer to \"home\", Dol's Saturday morning market and wonky old church gave us a flavour of true Frenchness that we might otherwise have missed given the strong Albion accent of Les Ormes. It even has full size all-weather cricket pitch, and one Sunday morning two teams of doughty expats added the sound of willow on leather to this strongly English scene, sheltering in a gazebo from the intermittent storms. </p> <p>We began our return journey early, leaving plenty of time to visit Cherbourg's La Cite De La Mare before renewing acquaintance with P&amp;O. Part maritime museum, part sea creature aquarium it offers everything from a tour round one of France's earliest nuclear submarines (complete with commentary featuring a firm-jawed exposition of \"deterrence\" theory) to display tanks as vast as those at the London aquarium. Highlights? For Daddy, 46, a pillar-shaped vessel of ethereal jellyfish. For Girl, 2, a fabricated sandbank of grainy rays which glided on whims to the surface to meet her wondering touch.

  "India's bandit king died as he lived: in dense forests at the tip of a bullet. <p>For more than two decades, Koose Muniswamy Veerappan eluded hundreds of police officers devoted to nothing but his capture. </p> <p>Wanted for the murder of 130 people and for butchering 2,000 elephants, Veerappan taunted state governments, striking defiant poses in combat fatigues with his muzzle-loading rifle and his luxuriant handlebar moustache. </p> <p>While his profile had never been higher, his powers had faded. Life on the run had taken a heavy toll on the 57-year-old. An ageing brigand with asthma and a bad stomach, he had recently lost the sight of his left eye, reducing considerably his ability to pass unnoticed through the south Indian forest. </p> <p>His condition had made it easy for undercover police to infiltrate Veerappan's gang and convince the criminal mastermind to take a ride to a rural hospital. </p> <p>Inside the van lounged Veerappan and three of his closest associates. Just before midnight on Monday, on a deserted jungle road, dozens of policemen ambushed and killed the outlaw and his henchmen in a 20-minute shoot-out. </p> <p>\"He had already shaved off his moustache to conceal his identity. But we had lured him into a trap. We ordered him to surrender but he refused. It was a pukka operation,\" said Jyoti Prakash Mirgi, the chief of Karnataka's special task force, who co-directed operations with his counterpart in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. </p> <p>Although Veerappan had a $1m bounty on his head, a figure almost unheard of in India, this amount is a fraction of the 1.5 billion rupees (\u00a319m) state governments have spent since 1990 hunting for him. </p> <p>Such is Veerappan's myth that hundreds of locals went to the local hospital to ask police to put his body on display. </p> <p>The legend of the bandit king began 40 years ago when forest rangers beat up a short, wiry young boy for trying to sneak after ivory poachers. A few years later Veerappan shot his first elephant and joined a notorious hunter's gang. Before long he had taken over the operation, and he committed his first murder in 1969. </p> <p>Despite this bloody beginning, Veerappan was notable for little more than his facial hair. To many officials he was just another small-time poacher holed up in the woods. It was only when ivory sales were banned in 1986 that Veerappan began to display the ruthlessness, cunning and financial acumen that set him apart from other criminals. </p> <p>His remarkable escape from behind bars that year by killing four policemen and an unarmed forest official in their sleep alerted state governments to his cold-bloodedness. </p> <p>By the late 1980s he had made a small fortune illegally cutting and smuggling sandalwood. Veerappan also dabbled in extortion, demanding monthly payments from the lime quarry owners in the hills overlooking his jungle lair. </p> <p>This activity soon alarmed the southern Indian states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which straddled Veerappan's domain. The 5ft 6in charismatic outlaw with an excellent shot became the target of forest rangers from both states. </p> <p>It was not long before the hunters became the hunted. Having spent his entire adult life in the forest, Veerappan was peerless in the art of jungle craft. He and his henchmen often mimicked the birds and deer in a system of warning signals that helped them dodge the authorities. </p> <p>Policeman, officials, even rival gangs were eliminated in vicious killing sprees. Veerappan once captured a senior forest official, beheaded him and hacked off his hands. He tied grenades to five policemen and blew them up in revenge for the capture of his gang members. He is also said to have strangled his own daughter. </p> <p>Most of his guns and equipment, including automatic rifles, were stolen from the police. Veerappan's gang ambushed patrols, made bombs and planted land-mines, blowing up official vehicles. </p> <p>Aware of his growing cult of personality, Veerappan cultivated the image of a romantic, gun-toting champion of the Tamil people and begun communicating to the outside world via taped messages and brief interviews with favoured journalists. </p> <p>He described his kidnappings and killings in detail, but depicted them as a righteous effort to avenge outrages committed by the police. </p> <p>In one particularly gruesome passage he recounted keeping the head of a victim as a \"souvenir\". Veerappan saw himself as a Robin Hood figure, protecting villagers who depended on illegally hunting elephants and cutting sandalwood for survival. </p> <p>His wife Muthulakshmi once said: \"Many may fear him but they also love him. He is always just, never misuses his power, helps out the villagers in their times of need [and] metes out instant justice to wrongdoers.\" </p> <p>Veerappan's media strategy also appeared to rest upon making politicians look helpless. Several times state governments accepted terms of his surrender, which included cash for the rehabilitation of his relatives and a minimal prison term for Veerappan himself in a special prison camp. India's most-wanted also demanded that a feature film be made about his life, and at one point insisted he would direct the film himself. </p> <p>Perhaps his most audacious criminal enterprise was to abduct south India's most famous film star, Rajkumar, in 2000. In what appeared a calculated move, Veerappan sought to inflame ethnic tensions between two of the largest communities in India: Tamils and the people of Karnataka. For the latter, Rajkumar was a cinematic god. </p> <p>The 100-day hostage crisis convulsed India and provoked rioting in Karnataka. Tamil newspaper offices were pelted with stones, schools closed and bus services were suspended. At least one fan committed suicide. </p> <p>Veerappan's demands for the release of Rajkumar read like a political manifesto for ethnic Tamils, with calls for the release of Tamil guerrillas and for statutes of Tamil poets to be erected in Karnataka. </p> <p>Despite this high-minded ransom note, the bandit eventually accepted $4.1m in cash and released the ageing matinee idol, who had high blood pressure and weak knees. </p> <p>Veerappan's next high-profile victim, a former minister, was not so lucky. His body was found two years ago on a roadside, riddled with bullets, after three months of being held captive by Veerappan. </p> <p>Recently more hi-tech methods were being deployed to track Veerappan. Armed with assault rifles and machine guns, police used night vision goggles, a global positioning system and helicopters to scour the jungle region. </p> <p>\"He was not mad, only extremely suspicious and alert,\" said Ajay Jha, one of the few reporters to have interviewed Veerappan. \"The guy could find his way through the forest in darkness and survive for weeks without food. But this man was nearly 60 years old. One has to ask why it took so long to capture him.\"</p>",
  "<b>What will change under the proposed legislation?</b> <p>If approved by parliament, the new rules will allow the creation of new, Las Vegas-style \"regional casinos\" where gamblers can play for unlimited jackpots twenty-four hours a day. It will also allow casinos in two other categories - \"large\" and \"small\" - to offer smaller prizes on slot machines.</p> <p>As a counter-balance, the government says the bill will remove some 6,000 slot machines from smaller premises such as fast food shops and minicab offices, to help reduce young people's access to gambling.</p> <p>The new legislation is also aimed at regulating remote betting, for example on interactive TV and the internet, though it will only apply if the operator is based in Great Britain.</p> <p>Racecourse betting will be allowed on Good Friday and Christmas Day for the first time.</p> <p><b>How will the new laws be regulated?</b></p> <p>The bill would create a gambling commission to supervise the industry, replacing the Gaming Board of Great Britain. The commission would ensure the casinos work within a strict framework and publish a social responsibility code to counter problem gambling.</p> <p>A new licensing regime would take the responsibility for approving premises away from local licensing justices and give it to local authorities.</p> <p><b>Who stands to gain?</b></p> <p>Gamblers for one, if they are lucky. Then there are the US operators who are vying to build the new casinos. One being planned in Coventry will be as big as a football pitch.</p> <p>The Treasury will also do nicely - millions of pounds in extra tax will be flooding into its coffers - and local councils will earn tens of millions by approving planning applications from the casino developers. Some are setting up lucrative but controversial 'section 106' deals - securing a permanent share in the venues - which critics argue will undermine councils' commitment to residents' interests.</p> <p><b>Who stands to lose?</b></p> <p>Gamblers, if they are unlucky. And the government - the controversial plans, which have been three years in the making , could backfire if they are received negatively by voters. This is a strong possibility considering Fleet Street's general antipathy (see below).</p> <p><b>Who supports the bill?</b></p> <p>The government and the US companies. The Local Government Association - which represents local councils - has given it a cautious welcome, saying that \"more work needs to be done to balance the opportunities and risks for local communities\".</p> <p><b>Who is against it?</b></p> <p>The national press gave the bill an unfavourable response. The Tories, religious leaders and gambling addiction support groups and charities have also voiced strong opposition. Labour backbenchers, led by former welfare minister Frank Field, are also concerned and could force the government to review sections of the legislation.</p> <p><b>What chance does the Bill have of being approved?</b></p> <p>The government has given the bill 'fast-track' treatment and hopes to get it on the statute books before the next general election. Providing it can avoid a revolt by backbenchers, it is expected to succeed.</p>",
  "The government's determination to get its gambling bill on to the statute book by the time of the general election beggars belief. With the exception of the behemoths of the international gaming industry and a handful of cash-strapped local authorities, there is almost no public demand at all for a bill as radical in effect as the one that was published yesterday by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell. A recent opinion poll found that 93% of the public think there are already sufficient opportunities to gamble in this country. Many of these forms of gambling, including the lottery and the football pools, have also been in gentle decline for some time. Compared with other western countries, British levels of problem gambling are low. All the main evidence is therefore that, when it comes to gambling, we like things much the way they are. Yet this government seems never to have grasped that if a thing ain't broken, it don't need fixing. Of all the measures that a good government might take to revive most British towns, letting rip the casino culture should come at or near the very bottom of the list. <p>So why is a Labour government still so determined to press ahead with this bill that it has gone out of its way to introduce the legislation towards the end of the current parliamentary session, with the intention of carrying it over into the pre-election one? The answer is that the bill is an ideological anachronism. It is a relic of the era at the start of Labour's second term when ministers were so blindly and confidently besotted with deregulation that, if a thing moved, they believed they had to marketise it. In so doing, they almost totally lost sight of the case for social protection on subjects like broadcasting, drinking hours and gambling itself. Fortunately, the pendulum has now begun to swing back in favour of a more balanced approach - a perverse benefit of the government's unpopularity over Iraq perhaps. In the case of the Licensing Act, Ms Jowell legislated in haste and is now repenting at leisure. In the cases of broadcasting and gambling, she and her department have at least been partly saved from themselves. Parliamentary pre-legislative scrutiny has taken some of the sting out of the worst of the department's original proposals, and Ms Jowell has been sensible enough to work with and not against her critics. But the gambling bill is still far from perfect. The question now is whether it can be improved still further in the months ahead, or whether it is better to subject it to a quiet and largely unlamented death. </p> <p>Ms Jowell protested yesterday that the bill is mainly about new protections not new casinos. That is true up to a point. Ninety per cent of the bill is not about casinos, and few people would quarrel with the general principle that the protective aspects of existing law need to be modernised for the online gambling age, especially where they affect children. But Ms Jowell's claim is also misleading. The reality is that casinos are the raison d'etre of the bill and that they are deeply undesirable in most instances. There may possibly be a case for resort casinos in places like Blackpool that have seen better days and may genuinely need the economic boost that destination casinos might provide. But that does not apply to Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and the rest, where the principle consequence of large new casinos will be a much greater incidence of problem gambling in a society already floating on a sea of personal debt. The bill certainly contains protections, but many of these would not be necessary if the casino clauses were not also there in the first place. At best, this bill still needs radically scaling down and tightening. At worst, it could be one of the most destructive aspects of Labour's legacy and a dreadful metaphor for the government's uncertain purpose. On balance, we would be better off without it.</p>",
  "It was Monday morning, the first day of early voting in Florida, and only an hour went by before the system collapsed in Broward County, ground zero for the 2000 fiasco in the state. Potential voters were turned away in this heavily Democratic county as election officials delivered a litany of excuses. The person in charge of elections is the secretary of state, Glenda Hood, a Republican. <p>It was an inauspicious beginning to Florida's election season, and a reminder that Democrats must remain vigilant against Republican efforts to steal yet another election. And in that regard, Republicans have been mighty busy.</p> <p>A small sampling of what Democrats face:</p> <p><b>Florida</b><br> Still facing lawsuits over its \"felon list\", which improperly excluded thousands of voters in 2000, Florida adopted a second felon list just as flawed as the first. While designed to prevent felons from voting, the list was purposely created so broadly that it stripped thousands of people of their legitimate right to vote. What's worse, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported that Republican governor Jeb Bush - brother of George Bush - knew the list was flawed and still rushed it into service. The state eventually junked the list under public pressure after more than 2,500 people were discovered inappropriately included in the list.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ms Hood ruled that voter registrations would be deemed incomplete if registrants forgot to check off the box affirming their citizenship, even though they affirm their citizenship elsewhere on the form. The ruling has excluded three times as many Democrats as Republicans.</p> <p><b>Nevada </b><br> A voter registration outfit, funded by the Republican party, set up booths around public areas to register voters to vote. However, back at the company's headquarters, Democratic registrations were said by a former employee to have been shredded and tossed. The outfit, which has operated in Oregon, West Virginia, and several other states, is now under investigation for suspected voter registration fraud. A Republican judge in Nevada subsequently ruled against allowing the thousands of disenfranchised voters to vote in November.</p> <p><b>Ohio</b><br> The Republican secretary of state, J Kenneth Blackwell, attempted to destroy thousands of new voter registrations because - he claimed - they were not printed in the proper card stock (a heavy 80-pound stock). Registration forms had been photocopied on regular paper and even printed in local newspapers. After intense public pressure Blackwell backed off.</p> <p>Meanwhile, voters in heavily Democratic Cleveland have been receiving mysterious pre-recorded calls telling them their voting location has been changed. Local election officials are investigating the malicious calls. The so-called \"robocall\", in fact, is now a staple of dirty campaigning.</p> <p><b>Wisconsin</b><br> The Republican in charge of ballot printing in Milwaukee County, one of the most heavily Democratic in this important swing state, has ordered the printing of 250,000 fewer ballots than election officials asked for in this high-interest race. In fact, the 679,000 ballots the county had offered to print is less than the total used in the 2000 election. The issue remains unresolved.</p> <p><b>New Hampshire</b><br> The New England chairman of the Bush/Cheney '04 operation, Jim Tobin, recently resigned over his alleged role in an illegal phone-bank jamming operation in 2002. New Hampshire Democrats had set up a phone bank operation to call supporters and urge them to the polls. Tobin, as head of the Republicans' north-east Senate operations, hired a firm to place thousands of automated hang-up calls to that phone bank, tying up the lines and preventing the Democrats from getting their supporters to the polls. His history did not stop him getting promotion within the Bush campaign this year.</p> <p><b>South Dakota</b><br> While not a presidential battleground state, South Dakota is the home of two bitterly contested federal races - that of Democratic Senate minority leader Tom Daschle and Democratic freshman congresswoman Stephanie Herseth. The nephew of Daschle's opponent was caught handling absentee ballots, claiming to be a notary when he is not. Larry Russell, the state director of the South Dakota Republicans' \"get out the vote\" efforts, resigned over questions surrounding absentee ballot applications. National Republicans promptly transferred him and five of his team members to Ohio, a promotion to the coveted battleground state. </p> <p>There is more, lots more. There are several clearing houses of voter suppression and fraud online, like the <a href=\"http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/Voter_Registration_Fraud_Clearinghouse\">Voter Registration Fraud Clearinghouse</a> and <a href=\"http://vote2004.eriposte.com/\">Vote Watch 2004</a>. </p> <p>These efforts are not isolated incidents, but part of the Republican Party's \"Victory\" programme. While ostensibly a voter registration and \"get out the vote\" operation, the programme includes a concerted nationwide effort by Republicans to lock in their electoral gains by any and all means necessary. Sounds like partisan rhetoric, sure, until you hear it from the source. Alluding to the fraud committed by his party in his home state of South Dakota, former Republican governor and congressman Bill Janklow told the Associated Press last week that the entire Victory programme is rife with electoral fraud: \"These people are cheating. When you tamper with it, you cheat the system. And cheating in elections is the worst form of cancer because it's uncontrollable.\"</p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Markos Moulitsas runs the <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">dailykos.com</a> US political blog, and <a href=\"http://www.ourcongress.org/\">Our Congress</a>, a blog tracking the hottest congressional races</p> <p>Comment on this article <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives//2004/10/.html\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The creation of spin-off companies by university researchers, one of the chancellor's key policies, has ground to a halt because of a catch-22 in tax legislation, say frustrated academics.</p> <p>Gordon Brown, who today hosted a seminar on science and wealth creation at 11 Downing Street, has been alerted to the problem, but has so far failed to sort out the muddle over the aptly named Schedule 22.</p> <p>Plans for scores of companies to work on developing science and research projects have been put on hold by universities after they learned that their academics were threatened with multimillion pound tax demands as soon as the companies started operating, long before they made any profits. </p> <p>To add insult to injury, the universities themselves are responsible for collecting the tax from their enterprising academics. </p> <p>University business development officers believe that spin-offs have almost ground to a halt and fear that delays will be damaging to many ideas and projects. </p> <p>Nationally, university spin-offs, which had been running at about 150 a year, plummeted by 48% following the introduction of the legislation last year. Most of the companies set up in the past year have been launched by researchers who were unaware of their new tax liabilities.</p> <p>The Conservatives' higher education spokesman, Chris Grayling, accused the chancellor of killing university spin-off companies \"stone dead\".</p> <p>Schedule 22 of the 2003 Finance Act was introduced by the chancellor to plug a tax loophole by which City firms were creating companies and funnelling in money. </p> <p>Employees were given shares on which they paid 10% tax instead of the 40% they would have been taxed on their wages. The Inland Revenue now values the spin-off company's assets and taxes the shareholders accordingly.</p> <p>But an unintended consequence was to catch entrepreneurial academics in the net. Nick Coleman, an electronic engineer at Newcastle University, was on the point of launching a company to develop a revolutionary microprocessor, when he discovered to his horror that he could be liable for a \u00a32.5m tax bill if he went ahead. </p> <p>The university had plans to set up a spin-off company, giving it the use of the patent of Dr Coleman's invention, which was the culmination of six years' research. But under Schedule 22 he would be taxed on the value of the patent as assessed by the Inland Revenue.</p> <p>He has now lost six months trying to find a way through the tax tangle. \"Delays are serious in the hi-tech field because the technology gets out of date so quickly. Without this we would have been up and running, employing a few people,\" said Dr Coleman today.</p> <p>\"The act has had the unintended consequence of putting a complete stop to university spinout actvities. It sounds ridiculous. It is ridiculous - but that's the unfortunate consequence of the Finance Act,\" he added.</p> <p>For more than a year, Unico, the university companies' organisation, has been engaged in talks with the Treasury, the Inland Revenue and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to try and find a way round the problem - so far without success. </p> <p>New legislation to correct the unforeseen impact of the 2003 Finance Act might be needed, said Tony Raven, Southampton University's business development officer and a member of the Unico board.</p> <p>Today the Treasury said Schedule 22 had been designed to protect the tax system against abuse but was seriously considering the tax issue facing university and public sector spin-off companies.</p> <p>\"Inland Revenue, Treasury and DTI officials have worked closely with the sector to try to find a structural solution. We are examining possible solutions that will provide certainty of treatment and ensure that an income tax charge does not arise on any intellectual property compensation unless and until the spinout is successful. Officials will continue to work with the industry to find the right way to deliver this commitment. ventures to exploit their ideas and inventions,\" said a spokeswoman. </p> <p>Mr Grayling, who has challenged Mr Brown in the Commons on the issue, said: \"Universities are a vital part of the future of our economy, and generate new ideas and concepts which will be essential to developing new businesses and business ideas for the future. </p> <p>\"It beggars belief that the government would introduce tax changes that would prevent academics and universities from creating new spin-off ventures, and the chancellor's actions are doing real damage to the future of British science. They will kill them stone dead.\"</p>",
  "<p>Liverpool could tonight be a step nearer to becoming the first city in the UK to ban smoking in public places.</p> <p>The city council has used statutory powers to draw up a local act of parliament which would make it illegal to smoke in city restaurants, pubs, shops and in the workplace. </p> <p>If the draft bill is passed by the council at its meeting tonight then the authority has until November 27 to petition parliament so that the bill can be included in the next round of proposed legislation and could become law within a year.</p> <p>The Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, Louise Ellman, has agreed to support the bill through the House of Commons while Lord Falconer of Worcester, who is also patron of the Roy Castle Cancer Foundation, has promised similar backing through the House of Lords.</p> <p>The bill will force the government's hand on whether it is prepared to see a change in the law to bring in a smoking ban - an avenue it has so far been reluctant to take.</p> <p>If the bill does become law it will only apply to Liverpool, but it would open the door for other councils to follow its lead.</p> <p>Liverpool councillor Richard Oglethorpe, council executive member for green issues, said: \"We are using this archaic piece of legislation because this is the only route open to us. I think it would be very hard for the government not to back the bill.\" </p> <p>The council said it was forced to take the unusual step of using a local act of parliament because other attempts to win government support for a smoking ban in the city, which have included bringing in new bylaws or using existing legislation, have failed.</p> <p>The latest move to ban smoking in Liverpool comes as the government and charities today launched a \u00a312m research programme into disease prevention and how lifestyle can prevent major disease such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. </p> <p>Also today, the all-party parliamentary group on smoking and health today urged the health secretary, John Reid, to ban smoking in public places after its fact-finding mission to Dublin, which with the rest of Ireland, became smoke-free in March this year. </p> <p>The call came the day after Mr Reid indicated that the government would not follow Ireland in banning smoking in all workplaces, including pubs and restaurants, but would find its own answers to the problem. </p> <p>But the all-party parliamentary group on smoking and health, which is sending Mr Reid a copy of its report following its Dublin visit, said that \"half-way measures\", including partial smoking restrictions, were not good enough. </p> <p>Its chairman David Taylor said: \"Ireland has shown that going smoke-free is achievable and popular. But more importantly it is the only way of ensuring that employees are protected from the proven hazards of second-hand smoke. Half-way measures such as partial smoking restrictions are simply not adequate to guarantee health protection.\"</p>",
  "<p>Every Christmas has its must-have toys - the ones all children are clamouring for.

This year, according to toy industry analysts, the toys we need to stock up on if our kids are to avoid playground embarrassment include the Power Ranger Tri-Battliser, the Robosapiens remote control robot, Cabbage Patch Kids and the latest TV star, Dora the Explorer. </p> <p>Parents are as much to blame as their children for the toy fads that come and go - and come again (Cabbage Patch dolls first set the tills ringing in 1983). We are the ones, after all, who do the paying - though often under extreme duress. From the end of this week, The Museum of Childhood in London is staging Must-Have Toys, a look back over the 20th century at the objects for which kids have badgered away remorselessly and over which parents have all too often given in with a resigned sigh. </p> <p>The exhibition offers a thought-provoking trip down memory lane. How I pleaded for a Rolf Harris Stylophone in the early 70s, unsuccessfully trying to convince my parents that it would kick-start my future career as a musician. And now? Well, I can appreciate that its blowing-through-Izal-toilet-paper-over-a-comb-but-tinnier sound may well have driven them to do grievous bodily harm to Rolf with his didgeridoo. </p> <p>The biggest question raised by the exhibition is how some of the assembled toys ever became that popular. \"The one that really puzzles me,\" says curator Helena Pasierbska, \"is the combine harvester that was the top toy of 1978. The only plausible explanation I have is its link with the popularity of the Wurzels' record at the time, I've Got a Brand New Combine Harvester.\" </p> <p>Certainly TV, music and cinema have often played their part in the creation of a must-have toy: from Sooty in the 50s through Star Wars in 1977 on to Bob the Builder and Harry Potter in more recent times. \"It is easy to see these outside influences and tie-ins as somehow corrupting toys,\" says Brian Ellis, an executive at toy manufacturer Hasbro, who now chairs the organisation Toy Industries of Europe. \"But what I think it points to is the quality of the intellectual property at the core. Take Thomas the Tank Engine: it started as a book - then television and toys followed. The same is true with Harry Potter, though it has gone into the cinema. The important thing is the brilliant idea in the middle that can then go on to inspire and excite and give free rein to imaginations in all sorts of ways from books to bedroom furniture.\" </p> <p>Ellis also acknowledges the increasing role of marketing in creating must-have toys. Since Sindy became the first to have a dedicated advertising campaign in Britain in the 1960s, commercial breaks crammed with pink and khaki hardware have become a fertile breeding ground for starting word-of-mouth must-haves with children, so much so that some parents now restrict any early-morning cartoon viewing to the BBC, which doesn't show adverts. But, Ellis points out, there have been expensive, good marketing campaigns that have failed to move merchandise - take the last Batman films, whose spin-offs have failed to sell well. </p> <p>So what are the crucial ingredients of the must-have toy? Price is crucial, says Pasierbska. \"If you look at the decade-by-decade list, most have been relatively inexpensive. I'm sure their low price is why Beyblades have lasted so long as a craze. </p> <p>Must-have toys should also be flexible, she says, so children can personalise them - dressing up their Barbie or Action Man - without their own interpretation being too different from others. \"When I grew up in the 1950s I had to have a Rosebud doll,\" says Pasierbska. \"It was all the rage. I wanted clothes for her that made mine look different from other girls' Rosebuds, but I absolutely didn't want a different doll.\" </p> <p>Less obvious forces are also at work in this must-have world - or at least, forces less obvious to adults. And that, it seems, is the key: there exists a playground underground we can't penetrate. I have, for example, been shown at least 10 times by my eight-year-old son how to play the Pok\u00e9mon card game that is currently obsessing him and his mates at breaktime; but all it's given me is the conviction that they make up the rules as they go along. </p> <p>Some crazes have left adults utterly bemused - such as the fad for silver scooters, only now abating. Is it something to do with the way they look, their colour, their ability to fold up? Why do children want these uncomfortable, slow machines with unfeasibly tiny wheels that throw you off at every broken paving stone when they could have a bike instead? Parents can't fathom it, and that in itself gives the scooter a cache. It puts them in the children's world, not ours. </p> <p>So how do we react to the list for Christmas 2004? Should we take refuge in the presence in the top 10 of such family favourites as Buckaroo, Twister and Cluedo (invented in 1949)? Retro toys are suddenly fashionable, so at least we can opt for something we might recognise and can play with once the children have gone to bed. </p> <p>Taking a stand on the educational value of toys, though, is a fool's errand. Manufacturers have clearly cottoned on to this parental instinct and give complete pap a fig leaf of educational worth. We have just given in and bought our five-year-old the Barbie laptop she had been begging for. We deluded ourselves it would improve her computer skills, but the excuse is wearing increasingly thin: she keeps emerging from behind the screen, asking when she can get her hair straightened and should she dye it blonde ... </p> <p> <strong>Half a century of popular play</strong></p> <p><strong> Christmas 2004</strong> </p> <p>Power Ranger Tri-Battliser, Robosapiens remote control robot, Bratz dolls, Cabbage Patch Kids, Tamagotchis and Dora the Explorer </p> <p><strong> 1990s</strong> </p> <p>Nintendo Game Boy, Spice Girl dolls, Buzz Lightyear, Teletubbies, Beanie Babies and yoyos </p> <p><strong> 1980s</strong> </p> <p>Star War figures, Care Bears, Rubik's Cube, Sylvanian Families, the Smurf House, Transformers, Big Yellow Teapot and Trivial Pursuit </p> <p><strong> 1970s</strong> </p> <p>Mastermind, Chopper bikes, Doctor Who Tardis, Katie Kopycat, Spacehopper, Weebles, skateboards and Clackers </p> <p><strong> 1960s</strong> </p> <p>James Bond Aston Martin, Spirograph, Etch-a-Sketch, Sindy, Barbie, Action Man and Stylophone </p> <p><strong> 1950s</strong> </p> <p>Subbuteo, Sooty, Archie Andrews ventriloquist doll, Muffin the Mule, Matchbox and Corgi cars and Scalextric </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Must-Have Toys opens at the Museum of Childhood, London E2 on Saturday.

  "<p>Councils will increasingly have less day-to-day control over local services, the education secretary said today.</p> <p>Delivering a blunt warning to local authority leaders, Charles Clarke said in future they would facilitate the provision of education and welfare services rather than run them.</p> <p>Addressing the national social services conference in Newcastle, he said: \"Let me say to you directly that your role will not for the most part be concerned with directly providing services - it will be increasingly about commissioning, and working with and through others.\"</p> <p>The minister indicated that the private and voluntary sectors would increasingly take over the running of local services from councils. Meanwhile, head teachers and managers of local children's centres would have operational control with councils merely having a strategic role to ensure agencies worked together and met national standards. </p> <p>Mr Clarke said schools will become even more autonomous and would not be obliged to cooperate with the reform of child welfare services - a move likely to increase unease among social services directors.</p> <p>The minister vehemently denied that he was \"trying to take schools away\" from local authority control. But pointing out that councils had lost responsibility for providing water, gas, electricity and social housing, he said it would be \"na\u00efve and unrealistic\" to reverse this trend and give them more control over the management and funding of local services.</p> <p>In comments which appeared to lay down the law, he said that councils' role in education was \"still about giving direction through leadership, not looking around for powers of Direction with a capital 'D' anymore than you have with providers in other sectors\".</p> <p>The government's recent five-year plan for education caused major jitters in local authorities. It included proposals to allow schools to \"earn\" greater freedom from local and central government control. Some schools would be completely independent of local authorities. From next year schools will also be allocated three-year budgets, further bypassing local authorities' remit over schools. </p> <p>Mr Clarke told the conference that education officers at a local level would retain their responsibilities over provision for children with special educational needs and schools admissions. In contrast, councils would have to broker agreements with schools to ensure that their admissions policies were fair and met the aims of Every Child Matters, the government's child welfare reform programme, said the minister.</p> <p>Local authorities would play a similar role in implementing the youth green paper, due out this autumn, by coordinating local services rather than providing them.</p>",
  "<p>I am pleased to address this joint audience of LGA Education and Social Services conference. This joint audience reflects the new world of children's services in which high educational standards and children's wider well being are rightly seen as an integral whole.</p> <p>Local government has played a central role in children's welfare and education, as well as in social history and social reform more generally over the past 125 years. </p> <p>A proud role but with a bitter sting in the tail. Local authorities have been key to tackling the problems of the day - to establishing new services that central government wanted. They have been the means of discharging society's and parliament's imperatives.</p> <p>So construction of sewer and public health systems came through local authorities. </p> <p>The first gas and electricity companies were municipal concerns. </p> <p>Local education boards were means of providing universal education. </p> <p>London county council (LCC) played a famous role at the turn of the 20th century in social housing. And the geography of outer London is to this day marked by the mental health asylums that the LCC created.</p> <p>After the second world war councils the length and breadth of the country were one of the key delivery arms of Harold Macmillan's housing drive.</p> <p>So the story goes on with public health services, children's services, sheltered housing, further and adult education. A proud record.</p> <p>In a phrase local government has been at its best when it has been at its most innovative. Identifying local needs, responding to new responsibilities, opening up new responsibilities.</p> <p>But that is only half the story. </p> <p>Because local government now has responsibility for very few of these services. </p> <p>Water, gas and electricity and sewerage are private concerns. </p> <p>The NHS is responsible for health. </p> <p>Much social housing has either been bought by former tenants or is being run by arms length bodies. </p> <p>Polytechnics and FE colleges are independent corporations. </p> <p>And here I am, so some of you think, trying to take schools away from you! </p> <p>Why this trend? </p> <p>In some cases economy of scale and investment required national organisation and action - so in the 1940s gas and electricity were nationalised. </p> <p>With some services - such as municipal housing - authorities were slow to respond to what people wanted as consumer aspirations rose and people expected a better service and wanted more control over their lives. </p> <p>And with some services - if we are honest - local government performance was (and in some places is) too patchy. Central government did not trust local authorities to deliver what it saw as being central to either the national good or its political purpose.</p> <p>You may say that that has been a wrong judgement but it is a fact. And has been a fact under governments of all political complexions.</p> <p>Bevan's decision to establish a National Health Service rather than go through local government was a very deliberate decision.</p> <p>The same with creation of the Manpower Services Commission to tackle unemployment. </p> <p>The same with FE. And then post 16 learning and the LSC. And most residential provision for elderly people. And Connexions Partnerships. And ring-fencing of grants.</p> <p>It's not that governments or ministers have thought that all local authorities are all hopeless. On the contrary, they know there are many many good councils out there, even a good majority. They know that they need local partners to deliver. But there has been an impasse. </p> <p>Local government has insisted on being independent. It has insisted on saying that all central government grant is 'our' money. That its local mandate is as valid as government's national mandate so ministers cannot tell councils what to do.</p> <p>On the other hand, ministers cannot be sure that if they make 'x' million available they will get 'y' outputs and outcomes in return. So they have gone for single purpose bodies with dedicated funding streams and clear accountabilities.</p> <p>Commentators then say that it is all a disaster. That successive governments have emasculated local government. That we are an awful terrible centralist government in a long line of centralising governments.</p> <p>Their answer - maybe your answer - is to just give all the power back to local authorities. </p> <p>That is both naive and unrealistic. It does not deal with the underlying issues and problems. </p> <p>As the secretary of state responsible for half of local government expenditure I want to end this historical stand-off. I want us to move on. John Prescott and I want a new settlement with local government. A new deal to benefit local government. A new partnership to boost opportunity and life chances.</p> <p>It has to be an honest settlement. </p> <p>First, honesty about the basis of the relationship </p> <p>The truth is that in certain areas the public wants, and expects, a universal - and uniformly excellent - service. Education standards and child protection are prime examples, where there is no public tolerance for a 'postcode lottery'. The public expect these to be provided as national services, which means that local government's role is in effect to act as agents for central government. We cannot deliver them without local agencies. But in these areas we need to be clear with our local partners on what they will deliver for what we provide.</p> <p>The other side of the deal - just as important - is that we should then allow you the maximum flexibility over how you achieve the agreed outcomes.</p> <p>That's of course the idea behind local PSAs. And now Local Area Agreements, which the deputy prime minister has championed. Our drive on funding rationalisation. New powers to pool budgets with other agencies.</p> <p>And, helping tie it all together, the development of the 'compact' philosophy through the new single conversations with local authorities. </p> <p>This is anything but mechanistic, process-driven relationship. It will be grounded in a shared understanding of our different roles in the delivery of national priorities. But also characterised by initiative and innovation. </p> <p>This, I've argued, is when local government is at its best. The last thing I want to do is stop you pushing the boat out in finding ways of securing better outcomes on the ground. And you must challenge us back if we are not moving fast enough to help you do just that.</p> <p>Second, honest about the nature of the relationship </p> <p>Let me say to you directly that your role will not for the most part be concerned with directly providing services - it will be increasingly about commissioning, and working with and through others.</p> <p>You face a huge and critical leadership challenge: vision and strategy, joining and empowering. Supporting and training others, joining up services and maximising linkages, increasing choice for users of services, getting people to work in partnership, spotting weaknesses and filling gaps. </p> <p>A role that plays \u00f1 here again \u00f1 to your historic strengths. To your role as community leaders. </p> <p>But leaving operational freedom to head teachers. To the managers of children's centres. Using a variety of partners in the public, private and voluntary sectors to deliver day to day services and so offer local people choice and quality.</p> <p>Third, central government should in return be honest about its need for local government. </p> <p>Central government should be positive rather than carping about local government's role. It should acknowledge a council's role as community leader. Within a clear framework of rights and responsibilities government should look to local authorities to lead and join up the work of other agencies rather than creating more and more new bodies to bypass them.</p> <p>That's why John Prescott gave you the power to promote economic, social and environmental well-being. And why, last July, he published a long-term vision for local government as leaders of their communities.</p> <p>And, fourth, central government should be honest about the limit to its own role. </p> <p>In those areas where you are providing local rather than national services - such as neighbourhood renewal and the whole liveability agendas - you should have maximum autonomy over what you do.</p> <p>That is the offer. A new deal. A new partnership. And to show that it is more than rhetoric let me set out what I think it means for key issues in some of the areas for which I have responsibility. I am looking to you to be key partners in creating an opportunity society.</p> <p><strong>Every Child Matters </strong> Local authorities have THE central role to play here. You will be at the heart of children's trust arrangements to drive though better outcomes for all children and young people. </p> <p>Leading work to ensure that really solid child protection arrangements are in place locally - with a strong emphasis on prevention - and to ensure whole-system reforms. We must never forget that the lessons of the Victoria Climbi\u00e9 inquiry were one of the prime movers of Every Child Matters. Ensuring universal services can meet the needs of vulnerable children is crucial.</p> <p>Leading strategic planning and needs analysis; commissioning services against the two poles of national expectations and local needs; driving through the changes needed on information sharing and the use of a common assessment framework. </p> <p>Building strong partnerships with voluntary and community sector providers. Extending the involvement of children and young people in decisions that affect them. Supporting families and parents. And now an explicit, statutory role in bringing local partners together: PCTs, Connexions, Sure Start, and Youth Offending Teams where agreed locally. </p> <p>All this requires powerful but very sophisticated leadership. Bringing together strong, autonomous local organisations around a common purpose and shared outcomes. Getting the strategies and support networks in place which empower and join up front line services providers - including of course through extended schools and children's centres.</p> <p> This is far from easy. The key to local success is your leadership and your capacity to grow and develop in that role. Let me be honest again and say that seeking extra powers to require other people to do things - in particular front line providers like schools - is simply a blind alley.</p> <p>It is through your leadership and the quality of your operation that you acquire authority, win consent and gain cooperation.</p> <p>What then is government's side of the bargain? To set the legislative framework. Clarify outcomes, aims and targets. A streamlined and proportionate system of accountability that directly supports you and your health and other colleagues in delivering better outcomes through children's trusts. Supporting your local change programmes and your local leaders.</p> <p>To set the frameworks - and then to give you the flexibilities. To avoid prescription in how to develop children's trusts. To rationalise and streamline our engagement with you through 'field forces', simplified and better coordinated inspections, and a single conversation process.</p> <p>And a simplification of children's services grants - amalgamating from 2006 four small grants into a single Children's Services Grant; the maximum discretion to target services at local need within clear national expectations.</p> <p><strong>Early Years and Childcare </strong> Local Authorities have been at the forefront of this agenda. Local effort has ensured delivery of universal nursery education for three and four-year-olds and the huge expansion of childcare. Your role - as local authorities and as prime movers of children's trusts - will continue to be critical in the delivery as we implement our ten year childcare strategy. </p> <p>You know the challenges: too many families having to join up services themselves. Childcare that is not sufficiently affordable or economically sustainable, particularly in disadvantaged areas. Patchy quality. Complex delivery. The evidence on the benefits of early intervention when children are young is now so powerful we must ensure high quality services reach the most vulnerable if we really want to improve child outcomes. </p> <p>We shall look to you, working with your children's trust partners, to ensure the future availability of childcare and early years services. But, again, this is not [primarily] about hands on day-to-day delivery. </p> <p>It's about managing local childcare markets. About leadership, brokering and commissioning. About supporting children's centres, childminders and extended schools. Making a reality of your role as champion and advocates for parents and children eg giving parents useful information and advice so that they can choose high quality childcare .</p> <p>Here too it's about creating the conditions and the context. Persuasion not coercion. Leadership that is followed because of the compelling vision it communicates and the respect and support it has earned.</p> <p>We will agree targets based on clear outputs with individual authorities. But part of the deal from our side will be funding rationalisation as funding continues to grow. </p> <p>I've mentioned the creation of a single Children's Services Grant. We're also planning to merge the various Sure Start funding streams into one allocation for Childcare to give you flexibility to help us carry through our Childcare agenda. </p> <p>Next year we want to work with the 18 authorities which are piloting Local Area Agreements to see how this contract approach - money for outcomes - might work.</p> <p><strong>New Relationship with Schools </strong> And I hope you can see, in the same way, the role we look to you to play in developing the new relationship with schools.</p> <p>The goal is a more coherent, less burdensome and more effective set of relationships. Less clutter in our relations with you, and in our joint relationships, through School Improvement Advisers, with schools. The empowering of schools to drive up standards and improve outcomes; to expand when they are successful; intelligent support and challenge; rationalisation of Standard's Fund grants; a fit for purpose inspection framework.</p> <p>Local authorities as promoters of personalisation and choice for students, as quality assurers of education services, as capacity builders and as enablers of collaboration across common boundaries.</p> <p>As advocates for parents and children you retain key responsibilities for SEN, admissions, schools places. But it's still about giving direction through leadership, not looking around for powers of Direction with a capital D, anymore than you have with providers in other sectors.</p> <p>Winning through quality of leadership rather than power to direct. </p> <p>So for instance support for the work of admissions forums in developing protocols for 'sharing' hard to place children. Intelligent brokering of placements for looked after children around a shared vision grounded in the Every Child Matters 'five outcomes'.</p> <p>And a mature and supportive relationship with the new Foundation Partnerships. The agreement of improvement contracts, protocols or service level agreements for groups of schools to deliver services such as pupil referral units, SEN or school improvement services.</p> <p>We expect to publish our prospectus on Foundation Partnerships by December. </p> <p>I certainly hope you are also positive about the school transport bill, introduced in the House of Commons on October 14. Another example of an innovative role for local government.</p> <p>Here we're saying to pilot local authorities 'design the system that's right for the school, pupils and the community you serve'. Which is exactly as it should be.</p> <p><strong>14-19/Youth green paper </strong> For older children and young people Monday's report from Mike Tomlinson was a hugely significant step forward. We want to reflect carefully on the detail. But he has given us radical proposals for reshaping qualifications to stretch every child, to recognise the range of skills young people need for life, and once and for all to get over the academic/vocational divide that has bedevilled English education for far too long. </p> <p>You again will have a vital role to play. Working with schools and colleges to support them in developing new opportunities to combine study, training and the world of work.</p> <p>I am certainly clear, by the way, that the local authority can act as a powerful mediator to ensure that spending on skills meets local priorities. Your interface with employers - and as major employers in your own right - also gives you a key role in building the skills base local areas need to remain economically competitive.</p> <p>Another important publication late this year will be the youth green paper. It will set out a package of policy proposals for young people centred around access to exciting and enjoyable activities and to better \u00f1 and where needed earlier - personal advice and support. Local government will again be at the heart of our approach - not so much as organisers of youth clubs; but more as co-rdinators and supporters of volunteers and local effort.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion </strong> So those who predict the death of local government are wrong. </p> <p>Yes - we have left behind the local authority as the fount of all knowledge and as the controller of all services. </p> <p>But they are wrong - completely wrong - because your task, reflected in the appointment of directors of children's services and lead members for children's services, is to lead the drive for higher standards and better outcomes across the whole children's services agenda.</p> <p>And wrong - completely wrong - because we need you as leaders, brokers, commissioners and enablers, advocates and innovators in the delivery of services for children, young people, parents and families. </p> <p>We want you as partners in change; partners in progress. </p> <p>I hope you will accept this challenge and work with us in creating an opportunity society for all.</p>",
  "The government was today accused of breaching the human rights of a former soldier who was exposed to mustard gas and nerve agent experiments at the Porton Down military base. <p>Thomas Roche, from Lancashire, claims the chemical and biological weapons tests, carried out more than 40 years ago, left him unable to work. </p> <p>However, the 65-year-old's efforts to access his medical records and launch legal action against the Ministry of Defence for compensation were repeatedly blocked, judges at the European court of human rights, in Strasbourg, heard. </p> <p>Mr Roche's lawyers said he had been attempting to bring a case for years, and the legal rulings that preventeded him from doing so were a breach of his human rights. </p> <p>They argued that the government had breached the human rights convention - to which the UK is a signatory - by using the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 to prevent Mr Roche from suing the MoD for negligence. The act effectively blocks any such proceedings concerning events that took place prior to 1987. </p> <p>Mr Roche's requests for his medical records were turned down, as was access to information about the Porton Down experiments he underwent in 1962 and 1963. </p> <p>The human rights judges must decide whether the lack of disclosure of documents and the use of the 1947 legislation to block legal action amounts to violations of human rights convention guarantees on the right to a fair hearing, the right to respect for private life, the protection of property and the prohibition of discrimination. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Mr Roche, who is registered disabled, won a high court victory in his long fight for a war disablement pension. </p> <p>Mr Justice Davis ruled that the pensions appeal tribunal had \"erred in law\" when it rejected his pension application after he developed chronic respiratory disease and hypertension - debilitating conditions which he says left him unemployable. </p> <p>Mr Roche served in the Royal Engineers between February 1954 and April 1968. In the first tests, he and seven other men were strapped into chairs in an unventilated room and, over a period of six hours, had drops of mustard gas applied to patches of uniform-type material taped to their skin. </p> <p>In 1963, he was placed in an airtight cubicle and inhaled GF gas through a face mask similar to an oxygen mask. </p> <p>At the high court hearing, his counsel, Fionn Pilbrow, said he had been given no warning that the tests could prove detrimental to his health. Volunteers said they were told not to relate their experiences, and that to do so would be a breach of the Official Secrets Act. </p> <p>The human rights judges were expected to deliver their verdict later this year or early in 2005.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of social workers could be barred from practising because they have failed to apply for professional registration, the profession's regulatory body warned today.</p> <p>From April next year no one will be allowed to work as a social worker unless they have registered with the General Social Care Council (GSCC).</p> <p>But more than three-quarters of England's social workers have yet to apply for professional registration with only six weeks left before the deadline for applications, according to figures published today.</p> <p>A GSCC spokeswoman warned that the council could not guarantee that social workers who applied after the deadline would be registered by April - and legally able to work.</p> <p>She said: \"We're in uncharted territory here. The law is changing as of April 1 and social workers will not be allowed to practise unless they are registered. </p> <p>\"Because the law hasn't changed yet social workers may be leaving registration to the last minute. But we're worried they may be caught out.\"</p> <p>Only 16,000 social workers' applications have been received by the GSCC - between a fifth and a quarter of England's qualified social workers.</p> <p>In half of councils across the country under 10% of social workers have applied for registration, according to the GSCC. </p> <p>It said that only five councils - Hartlepool, the Isle of Wight, Leicestershire, Somerset and Wokingham - have made good progress in registering social workers. More than 75% of social workers in these authorities are in the process of being registered.</p>",
  "<p>Anglia Polytechnic University has become the first university to fail the new-style government inspection system.</p> <p>Inspectors, who visited the university in May, said they had \"limited confidence\" in the university.</p> <p>APU, which is the only university to cling proudly to its pre-1992 polytechnic label, insisted it was addressing the problems. </p> <p>The concerns centre on the university's management systems. The inspection report, published this week by the Quality Assurance Agency, said, \"as a matter of urgency\", APU needed to overhaul its system for monitoring awards and how it communicates its procedures and policies to students and staff. It also advised managers to review the university's \"confusing\" committee system and the way student feedback is used.</p> <p>However, it commended the university's \"strong emphasis on learning and teaching\".</p> <p>The university's pro-vice-chancellor, Lesley Dobree, who has been in the post for four weeks, told EducationGuardian.co.uk today: \"We're obviously disappointed at the outcome of the visit.\"</p> <p>Asked whether she was worried about the impact on student recruitment, she said: \"We are anxious about what the implications are, but I believe that... they were not questioning the issue around the quality of the academic experience. It's a quality systems issue. It's not about what happens on the ground, it's about how issues track through the university.\" </p> <p>Asked who was responsible for the problems, Ms Dobree said: \"At the end of the day it must rest with the vice-chancellor, the chief executive.\" </p> <p>The current vice-chancellor, David Tidmarsh, has been in the post for six months, following the retirement of his predecessor, Michael Malone-Lee. </p> <p>In an effort to appease students' fears about the judgment, Ms Dobree published an open letter in which she promised a major reorganisation at the university.</p> <p>\"Please be assured we take our responsibility for ensuring high standards and good quality very seriously. This judgment does not in any way imply that there are problems with your programme of study or with your APU degree or award,\" she wrote. </p> <p>The student union is so far sticking by the university. It published its own statement to members saying it was satisfied the university was trying to solve the problems. </p> <p>But its president, Andi Thwaites, called on the university to \"invest in student representation through the union\". The inspection report was critical of the lack of involvement students had in the governing of their university. </p> <p>\"We are uniquely placed to engage students, and with the right support will be able to deliver substantial change. APU students' union is convinced that proper communication with students will ensure future success.\"</p> <p>APU had considered challenging the report, as it believed it could provide documentary evidence that the concerns were unfair. However, this has since been dropped in favour of rectifying the problems ahead of a second inspection next year that will check on progress. </p> <p>APU is only the third higher education institution to receive a verdict of limited confidence in the 18 months since the new audit reports were introduced - and it is the first university.

  "<p>The battle for control of Group F begins in earnest tonight when Milan confront Barcelona at the San Siro in the most mouthwatering Champions League meeting of the week. </p> <p>Barcelona, impressive leaders of the Spanish League, head the section from the Italian champions on goal difference, both clubs having beaten Shakhtar Donetsk and Celtic in their opening two games. But the manner of their respective victories could not have been more different. </p> <p>Milan are only now rediscovering their form, moving to second in Serie A after edging out Donetsk 1-0 and then needing two late goals to see off Celtic 3-1. </p> <p>Frank Rijkaard's Barcelona, unbeaten at home and abroad, defeated both those opponents comfortably and looked to be playing within themselves. </p> <p>So Barcelona threaten to be clearly Milan's most difficult opponents to date but the sheer pedigree of the six-times European champions - who crushed the Catalan club 4-0 in the 1994 final - and the fact that the Italians have a full-strength squad have ensured there is no over-confidence in Rijkaard's team. </p> <p>Their striker and African player of the year Samuel Eto'o, who has been in outstanding form since joining from Real Mallorca in summer, said: \"We must make sure we retain the humility that has served us so well up until now. </p> <p>\"The game against Milan is a very important one, but we need to stay calm and concentrate as much as possible on the task in hand.\" </p> <p>For Milan, Carlo Ancelotti is expected to start with Filippo Inzaghi, who has recovered from an ankle injury. The 31-year-old striker came on as a substitute to score the second goal in Milan's win over Celtic. </p> <p>Barcelona were heartened yesterday to see that their inspirational defender Carles Puyol appears to have shaken off a minor knee injury. He should start tonight. </p> <p>Group G has its own fascinating Spanish-Italian confrontation tonight, with Claudio Ranieri's Valencia at home to Internazionale. Valencia will be thirsting for revenge against Inter, who have eliminated them from Europe twice in the three last seasons. </p> <p>With Valencia's Rome-born coach leading a squad including five of his compatriots - Stefano Fiore, Bernardo Corradi, Emiliano Moretti, Marco Di Vaio and Amedeo Carboni - the teams will know even more about each other now. </p> <p>The Spanish champions and Uefa Cup holders lost to Werder Bremen in their previous game and trail Inter, group leaders, by three points; they can ill-afford another defeat. As in the setback in Germany last month, Valencia's 2-1 domestic loss to Sevilla on Sunday came after taking the lead. </p> <p>Inter hit top form at the weekend in a 3-1 win against Udinese in which the Brazilian striker Adriano scored two spectacular goals just 24 hours after flying back from South America. </p> <p>He is set to be partnered by Christian Vieri, who scored the other goal against Udinese, his first since April.</p>",
  "<p>The Financial Times today won its action to strike out a record \u00a3230.5m libel damages claim from City brokers Collins Stewart that could have closed down the pink paper.</p> <p>It means the broker will not be able to proceed with such an enormous damages claim when the libel trial against the FT starts next April.</p> <p>In a judgment delivered today at the high court, the judge said he had decided that Collins Stewart would not be able to win this part of its claim. </p> <p>\"A trial of that issue would be a waste of time. I have struck it out,\" said Mr Justice Tugendhat.</p> <p>Collins Stewart had argued that the size of the damages claim should reflect the drop in value of the company because its share price dropped following an FT article, published in August 2003.</p> <p>The company was seeking damages over an article headed \"Reputations on the Line at Collins Stewart\". </p> <p>The judge said that the remaining issues of damages - including substantial claims for loss of business and other financial loss - should be tried by a judge sitting alone and not a jury - should the company win on liability. This hearing would take place after the main trial.</p> <p>The decision is being hailed as a victory for press freedom. Andrew Gowers, the Financial Times editor, said it would have been \"a dark day for journalism\" if it had gone the other way.</p> <p>The libel action will still go ahead but today's judgment means Collins Stewart's damages, should it win the action, will not run into hundreds of millions of pounds. </p> <p>\"We are extremely pleased that the judge's decision today has vindicated the belief we have always held - that the basis for Collins Stewart \u00a3230.5m damages claim was manifest nonsense and untenable in law,\" said Mr Gowers.</p> <p>\"It would be a very dark day for journalism and for a free press if publishers were to be held liable for a drop in share price following publication of an article reporting on company events.</p> <p>\"We were always confident that the judge would share our belief and throw this unprecedented special damages claim out.\"</p> <p>Had the judgment gone the other way it would have set a precedent that would have allowed companies to sue newspapers every time they suffered share price falls as a result of alleged defamatory articles.</p> <p>Mr Gowers said the FT would continue to defend Collins Stewart's claim \"robustly and vigorously\", when the libel trial begins in April.</p> <p>\"The legal issues relating to the actual libel claim are relatively straightforward and we are pleased that the court will now be able to hear them in April without the spectre of a misconceived and, frankly, preposterous damages claim hanging over the trial.\"</p> <p>Collins Stewart is separately pursuing a damages claim of at least \u00a337m to reflect alleged losses in earnings as a result of the article it claims defamed the company.</p> <p>A spokesman for the company said today: \"The FT's lawyers may dance about this but it does not affect our libel case or our \u00a337m special damages claim.\"</p> <p>At a hearing earlier this month to decide whether Collins Stewart could proceed with such an enormous claim, the FT accused the City broker of seeking \"wholly illegitimate\" damages. </p> <p>Lawyers for the newspaper accused the firm of trying to get into the Guinness Book of Records with its \u00a3230m claim, which was based on the fall in share price following an article published in the FT in August last year. </p> <p>\"It is, of course, an enormous claim,\" the FT's barrister, Desmond Browne QC, said at the high court hearing on October 4 when the paper was attempting to have the damages claim struck out.</p> <p>\"The claimants and the chief executive [Terry Smith] seem as though they are determined to get into the Guinness Book of Records. We would say that if this was a legitimate way into that volume then it would have been tried successfully by someone before.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Pity the new chief nursing officer, lumbered with curbing the health service's burgeoning rates of MRSA and other hospital-acquired infections. If ever there was a problem unsusceptible to the efforts of even the most Stakhanovite individual, this is it.</p> <p>Yet urgent and concerted action is certainly needed. In England, 100,000 patients a year pick up infections in hospital and 5,000 die as a result, with MRSA the most common cause. Cases have increased by 600% in a decade and by 3.6% last year alone. These rates are among the worst in Europe.</p> <p>This is despite a string of initiatives since 1988, when the Department of Health issued its first national guidance on infection control in hospitals. More followed in 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998. In 1999, NHS trusts were told to meet 15 new standards on infection control. But two landmark reports by the National Audit Office - in 2000 and 2004 - have highlighted lax progress.</p> <p>Only last December the chief medical officer launched another major initiative - to ensure every trust appointed a \"bug-buster\" tsar in a \"call to arms\" against poor hospital hygiene. This summer the health secretary, John Reid, said patients should get specially programmed bedside telephones to complain about cleaning, and should challenge doctors and nurses on whether they have washed their hands. He also revealed that search parties would be sent into hospitals unannounced every three months to check cleanliness. Last month, the National Patient Safety Agency proposed placing alcohol rubs beside every hospital bed to encourage staff to clean their hands. </p> <p>Every exhortation is a little shriller than the last. And still infection rates rise inexorably.</p> <p>Putting a newly promoted civil servant in charge of reversing the trend may tap fresh enthusiasm, but will bring no ready solution. Curbing MRSA is a complex task that will rely on action by many people at many levels.</p> <p>First, long-ingrained staff attitudes must change across the NHS. MRSA is not just a problem in acute hospitals: the Commission for Health Improvement found cause for concern about infection control in all types of NHS organisations with patient contact. And infection control is not merely a responsibility for doctors and nurses: portering and domestic staff, ambulance crews and receptionists need to understand its importance too. </p> <p>So do managers. CHI found that where trusts had infection control policies, staff often failed to implement them, especially for handwashing, sterilisation and disinfection. Good practice might exist in one part of a trust without being adopted by the organisation as a whole.</p> <p>Replacing the NHS's dilapidated building stock is vital. Once a ward has become infected with MRSA it can be hard to eradicate. NHS hospitals are short of single rooms in which to isolate infected patients - a technique widely and successfully used in European hospitals. Bromley hospital halved its MRSA rate when it moved to new premises with more single rooms.</p> <p>Ministers have a part to play too - apart from banging the table and demanding action. Evidence suggests infection control is adversely affected by other NHS policies and priorities. Increased throughput of patients to meet performance targets has raised bed-occupancy to levels incompatible with good bed-management practice. Overcrowded wards and the need to move patients frequently are another hazard.</p> <p>New treatment centres to separate emergency and non-emergency patients, more investment in new equipment and increased staff numbers may all, in time, help ease MRSA rates. But that won't be before the next election, and other policies - such as payment by results, which offers incentives to treat ever greater numbers - may further conflict with infection control aims.</p> <p>The chief nursing officer may soon want to negotiate a change in her job description.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Davies is a freelance writer specialising in health.

  "<p>Global warming threatens to reverse human progress and make international targets on halving world poverty by 2015 unattainable, a study published today said. </p> <p>The claim comes from charities including Greenpeace, Oxfam and Action Aid who have joined forces, under the banner of the <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/10/20/report.pdf\">Working Group on Climate Change and Development</a>, to release the report, called Up In Smoke, in London today.</p> <p>The group's warning follows a summer in which hurricanes Jeanne and Ivan wreaked havoc across the Caribbean and Bangladesh saw its worst flooding for years. </p> <p>In a world in which global warming is a reality, it says, such severe weather events are likely to become more frequent and extreme - and the poor will be hardest hit. </p> <p>The group is urging the international community to take urgent action to introduce: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A global risk assessment of the likely costs of adaptation to climate change in poor countries</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries of between 60% and 80%, relative to 1990 levels, by the middle of this century. This goes far beyond the targets of the Kyoto protocol on climate change. </p> <p>The report says the cuts are vital in order to stop climate change running out of control - defined as a rise in global average temperatures of more than 2C (4F) above pre-industrial levels. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> New funding to help poor countries adapt - bearing in mind that rich countries' subsidies to their own fossil fuel industries stood at $73bn (\u00a340bn) a year in the late 1990s. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Effective and efficient arrangements to respond to the increasing burden of climate-related disaster relief.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Small-scale renewable energy projects promoted by governments and community groups that can be copied and developed in order to help tackle poverty and reduce climate change. </p> <p>This move will require political commitment in the form of new funds from governments in all countries and a major shift in priorities by the World Bank and other development bodies, the report says. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Coordinated local and international plans for relocating threatened communities with appropriate political, legal and financial resources.</p> <p>The report says the prime minister, Tony Blair, has signalled that he will use the UK's presidency of the G8 nations in 2005 to bring the issues of climate change and Africa - where many of the world's poorest countries are found - to the top of the international political agenda. </p> <p>Welcoming this commitment, the coalition says an either/or approach to climate change and poverty reduction is not an option: the world must face up to the inseparable challenges of poverty and a rapidly warming global climate. </p> <p>Andrew Simms, author and policy director of the New Economics Foundation, which organised it, said: \"Thousands of people, from the grassroots to Gordon Brown, are aiming to make poverty history, but global warming has been critically overlooked. Like a fire smouldering in the basement it threatens to burn down all they have built up. </p> <p>\"To rescue the situation we need a global framework to stop climate change that is based on equality, and we have to ensure that plans for human development are made both climate proof and climate friendly.\" </p> <p>Archbishop Tutu, Nobel Peace laureate and former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, said: \"I urge governments and development and environmental organisations to work together to find sustainable solutions to avert a catastrophe that will exacerbate human suffering to a magnitude that perhaps the world has not yet seen.\" </p> <p>The environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Blair would make climate change a priority during Britain's presidency of the G8.</p> <p>Ms Beckett said: \"No one can welcome what the report says, but ... I very much welcome the direction of the report and the way that it is bringing people with these concerns together.\" </p> <p>She said she hoped the report would increase pressure on the US to shift its stance on global warming. </p> <p>\"It is true that the present American administration - and the last one - were not prepared to sign up to the Kyoto protocol, but we are moving on without America,\" she said. </p> <p>The environment secretary rejected claims that climate change could only be halted by a switch to nuclear power. </p> <p>The government has not ruled out the future development of nuclear power, but Ms Beckett made it clear that she did not accept the argument that it was a \"clean\" fuel because it did not produce carbon emissions.</p>",
  "<p>Investors who lost a total of around \u00a33.5m when they invested in high risk precipice bonds will be compensated by the company which advised them, it was announced today. </p> <p>Around 500 investors lost money after taking advice from Royal Sun Alliance Trust Company Ltd, which later became Capita Trust Company Ltd, between June 1997 and September 2002. </p> <p>The Financial Services Authority (FSA) fined Capita \u00a3300,000 today for mis-selling the high-income bonds, where the capital investment is linked to the stock market and therefore at risk. </p> <p>A spokesman for the FSA told Guardian Unlimited Money that the body was pleased that Capita had cooperated fully with its investigation and had quickly agreed to compensate its customers to the tune of \u00a33.5m. Were it not for the level of co-operation shown by the firm, the financial penalty would have been considerably higher, the FSA said. </p> <p>Capita's marketing of precipice bonds to an estimated customer base of 3,000 potentially placed a significant number of customers at risk of loss. In all of the 60 files reviewed by the FSA, the firm had failed to ensure its customers understood the nature of the risks involved. In as many as 95% of these transactions, the firm had failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the recommendation made was suitable for the customer. </p> <p>The company was first put on notice in August 2001 that there were serious deficiencies in its advisory sales processes. It nonetheless failed to review its past bond recommendations to check whether unsuitable advice had been given, and it failed to implement changes suggested by its consultants. </p> <p>Andrew Procter, FSA director of enforcement, said: \"It is essential that higher risk products be promoted with great care, and the risks must be clearly and unambiguously explained to customers. </p> <p>\"Over a sustained period this firm failed to provide customers with suitable advice. Such a very high failure rate over such a prolonged period would normally merit a significantly higher financial penalty. </p> <p>\"However, in acknowledging its responsibilities to its customers, the firm has ensured that none of the investors will lose out as a result of the firm's historic compliance failings and has co-operated fully throughout the investigation. </p> <p>\"The firm has volunteered to proceed straight to compensation for all of its precipice bonds customers and will pay approximately \u00a33.5m to those who have suffered a loss, without requiring proof of unsuitability in each individual case. </p> <p>\"This action will mean that the firm's customers who have suffered a loss will receive redress much more quickly than would have been possible if the firm had not co-operated with the FSA in this manner. This is in marked contrast to some recent cases where firms have put them themselves into liquidation, leaving investors to rely on the Financial Services Compensation Scheme for compensation.\" </p> <p>The majority (75%) of the precipice bond transactions were based on advice given to customers between September 1997 and May 2001 when the firm was Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Trust Company Ltd. </p> <p>After May 2001, when the firm became Capita Trust Company Ltd, the sales of these products continued for a further 15 months, gradually winding down to a fairly low volume until September 2002, after which no more bonds were recommended by the firm. </p> <p>More than 50 varieties of precipice bonds were sold with capital losses ranging from 9% to 100% depending on the particular bond, but most of the capital losses exceeded 50%.</p>",
  "We are soon, it seems, to become a nation of gamblers - today sees the publication of the government's Gambling Bill which, if approved, will allow unlimited jackpots and pave the way for new super-casinos to be built across Britain. But what about those of us who because of ignorance, a lack of greed or a profitably spent youth, remain untutored in this highly addictive pastime? For the utterly uninitiated, we present a brief gambling primer. The information is, by necessity, a bit basic, but don't worry too much about grasping the finer points of strategy right away. Your money is as good as anyone's. <p><b> Dice </b><br> </p> <p>Dice are the oldest gambling tools we have. They are so old that nobody knows how old they are. Dice have been found in Egyptian tombs dated to 2000BC, and examples believed to be 8,000 years old have been dug up by archaeologists. It was probably the Romans who invented the cubical, six-sided dice that we know today. </p> <p>You will probably recognise dice as the universal 1-to-6 random-number generator which allow modern boardgames to proceed in a fair and orderly fashion. Without dice, Monopoly would be so much like capitalism that no one would want to play. When dice are paired up, however, the randomness becomes skewed. With two dice there is but one way to make two (one and one) and one way to make 12 (six and six), but six ways to throw a seven. It is this pyramidical hierarchy of odds that gave rise to the popular game known as craps, based on an old English game called Hazard. </p> <p>In its purest form craps consists of two dice, several people with money and a small area of pavement in an insalubrious neighbourhood. The \"shooter\", or thrower, places a bet, thereby inviting the others to bet against him. If he throws a seven or an 11 he wins automatically; a two, three or 12 and he loses instantly. Any other number he throws becomes his \"point\", which he must throw again before he throws a seven. If he fails, he loses his money and must relinquish the dice. </p> <p>In a casino, craps is played at a big table marked with lots of options, enabling bystanders to bet with or against the shooter in a variety of complex ways. The beauty of this form of craps is that you can join in without really knowing the rules. Just place your chips in different spots on the layout board, at regular intervals, until they are all gone. Way to go! You're playing craps! </p> <p><b> Roulette </b><br> </p> <p>Some people say that the 17th-century French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal invented the roulette wheel while he was experimenting with perpetual motion. This is almost certainly what historians term \"bollocks\", but the hypnotic wheel of fortune remains, for casino owners anyway, a perpetual money-making machine. The wheel spins one way, the ball spins the other, you bet on which number it will land on, and then it doesn't. Actually, there are many other ways to lose - too many to go into here. The chief pleasure of roulette lies in being able to part with your money while the wheel is rolling, right up until the dealer says, \"No more bets!\" It makes you feel like James Bond, until they bring you your credit card on a silver tray, snipped in four pieces. </p> <p><b> Cards </b><br> </p> <p>The earliest reference to playing cards in Europe is a 1377 Florence statute regulating their use, but the history of cards is bound up with the occult: packs of cards with images on them have been used to play games and tell fortunes for centuries. The Tarot deck was probably originally used to play a form of bridge, with all the extra picture cards acting as permanent trumps. Today magicians still use standard playing cards to perform tricks, which is why, more than any other form of gambling, cards are associated with cheating. </p> <p>The two main gambling card games are poker and blackjack. Poker is a modern form of fortune-telling where everyone is trying to divine what cards the other players have. If you think you might have a natural talent for reading other people's minds, then a few hands of poker is the best way to disabuse yourself of that idiotic fancy. It's expensive, but it works. </p> <p>As far its adherents are concerned, poker is hardly gambling at all. \"The difference between card games against other players such as poker, and games against the house such as roulette, is that poker is a game of skill and the odds are not stacked against you,\" says Brian Johnson, chief executive of the World Poker Championship. \"I'd rather the odds are in my favour and that I am able to use my poker skills rather than relying on chance and the roll of a die or ball.\" If you're new to poker, pay close attention to what Mr Johnson is saying, and remember that it does not apply to you. You are better off with the ball. </p> <p>Blackjack is generally recognised as the game in which the punter has the best odds against the casino, but to win consistently you need to be able to count cards, which is very difficult, and you need to be able to do it in a way that the casino can't spot, which is nigh on impossible. Some professional gamblers do make a tidy living playing blackjack, so bear in mind that the casinos need to recoup this money from punters like you. </p> <p><b> Slot machines </b><br> </p> <p>The slot machine was invented in 1895 by an American car mechanic called Charles Fey. It was originally introduced into Las Vegas casinos as a way of entertaining the female companions of high rollers. Today it is so popular that pulling down the handle of a one-armed bandit is the only form of exercise many Americans ever take. </p> <p>Slot machines embody the idea of gambling as an act of faith: you put money in one, and you trust that when it decides to hang on to it and give you nothing in return, it has done so for all the right reasons. It is a sort of cashpoint in reverse. The new legislation will actually eliminate slot machines from certain venues, but you can now play slots online. This is an almost perfect form of gambling, an efficient electronic interface enabling you to donate your money to a large offshore corporation at the push of a button. It's the future.</p>",
  "<p>Councils today called for greater powers to control gambling on their doorsteps.</p> <p>The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents local authorities in England, has warned \"more work needs to be done\" on the new gambling bill, \"to balance the opportunities and risks for local communities\".</p> <p>In its response to the government gambling bill, published yesterday, the LGA shares widespread concern that the wider availability of gambling proposed in the bill could increase the potential for harm to children, young adults and vulnerable people.</p> <p>The bill, which seeks to reform existing gambling legislation, will relax current gambling restrictions by giving councils new powers to license gambling premises in the interests of local communities.</p> <p>While a number of local authorities will want to take advantage of the opportunities for regeneration and employment presented by the development of new casinos, the LGA says this need to be balanced by stronger powers to enable councils to safeguard local well-being.</p> <p>The LGA's assessment of the new bill signals its intention to lobby parliament to secure strong safeguarding powers for local authorities. </p> <p>It notes: \"We believe that the solution to balancing these two issues is for the local community to be given as much freedom as possible to determine whether they wish to have increased gambling opportunities in their area or not.</p> <p>\"The LGA has so far persuaded the government to amend the draft bill in order to give local councils the power to refuse new casinos in their area but will also be lobbying as the bill goes through parliament for additional safeguards, for example additional powers for councils to consider whether gambling premises might create a 'public nuisance' in their licensing decisions.\"</p> <p>Commenting today on the new bill, Dame Sally Powell, chairwoman of the LGA's safer communities board, said it was paramount that necessary powers were introduced.</p> <p>\"The government's gambling bill proposals will help some local councils to regenerate deprived areas, in terms of creating new jobs and tourism. </p> <p>\"However there is also a need to proceed with some caution on these measures to ensure that there are not significant losers in terms of problem gamblers and people getting into debt.\"</p>",
  "The battle lines were drawn for a pre-election row over gambling yesterday when the government published a 203-page bill introducing the most sweeping reforms in a generation. <p>The Tories joined forces with religious groups to accuse the government of paving the way for Las Vegas-style casinos which would place vulnerable people at risk. </p> <p>The gambling bill, which should be on the statute book before next year's general election, is the culmination of three years' work. Ministers say they have to reform the law because new technology has meant that vast areas of the gambling business, particularly on the internet, are largely unregulated. </p> <p>Their argument that the measure will offer new protection to gamblers has suffered a major setback after newspapers launched a campaign against the plans. </p> <p>The opposition has taken particular exception to the proposal to set up to 40 \"regional casinos\". Tales have abounded of how American companies are offering millions of pounds to induce local councils to allow them to set up huge casinos. </p> <p>John Whittingdale, the shadow culture secretary, accepted the need to update the law but said the legislation as it stood could increase problem gambling and damage the gaming industry. </p> <p>All sides agree that there will be one key beneficiary. Spending on gambling is expected to increase from \u00a38.7bn a year to \u00a312bn within five years, netting a small fortune for the treasury.</p>",
  "<p>Montreal-based choreographer Ginette Laurin celebrates 20 years of her company O Vertigo this year, and her new work, Passare, is in part about memory. It is also about \"the infinitely large and the infinitesimally small\" (Laurin collaborated with an astrophysicist in its creation), and it touches on time, chaos, dreams and angels. With such themes, it could easily topple into the black hole of its own ambitions - indeed, it sometimes teeters on that brink - or shrink back towards the banal. But it also has moments of shivering beauty that brush the sublime. </p> <p>Passare works though free association, juxtaposing images and actions and letting our minds jump the sometimes vertiginous gaps between them. It can be playful, as when the dancers' childhood stories gradually become mixed up with each other's memories to hilarious effect. It can also be luminously beautiful. A hallucinatory dream sequence features a strange antlered creature, a naked angel, an arguing couple, a ghostly caped figure and a lost girl - shards of fantasy and memory that Laurin scatters and reshuffles against a projected background image of a galaxy. </p> <p>Laurin enjoys such contrasts of scale and intimacy, the collisions between feeling and physics. A filmed dancer traces sensuous arcs of light with her arms, and their after-image dissolves seamlessly into a picture of the spirals made by a subatomic particle as it decays. Images of trails abound - dancers shadowing each other's moves, cradling an absent partner, or moving about a grid that is invisible to them but made clear to us on a screen. </p> <p>Laurin's is an almost Blakean vision: the human body as merely the material form of a vaster, numinous universe of memories, dreams and the laws of nature. The closing scene lights the dancers' hands on the darkened stage - radiant orbs that burn into the backdrop and remain hanging as the stage empties, like fading stars.</p>",
  "<p>An unknown 25-year-old actor looks set to leap from zero to hero if swirling news reports are to be believed. Brandon Routh is tipped to take the role of Superman in the forthcoming Warner Bros blockbuster, to be directed by The Usual Suspects' Bryan Singer.</p> <p>Routh himself makes for a most unusual suspect. This time last week, he was scarcely a name in his own household, with a career limited to a smattering of TV appearances on Will &amp;Grace and One Life to Live. He recently completed work on his film debut, Deadly, directed by Joel Bender.</p> <p>Routh's arrival ends one of Hollywood's longest-running casting sagas. Over the past five years, a veritable coach-load of actors have been tipped to play the man of steel, from the famous (Nicolas Cage, Ashton Kutcher, Josh Hartnett) to the obscure (Jason Behr, Jared Padalecki). Meanwhile the project has been shuttled between directors, from Charlie's Angel director McG to Brett Ratner and now to Singer. Shooting is due to start in Australia early next year.</p> <p>For the time being, Superman fans might like to note that Routh is a native of Norwalk, Iowa, which is barely a 100 miles from the birthplace of George Reeves, the original TV Superman in the 1950s.</p>",
  "If a week is a long time in politics then seven months is an eternity. At least this is how it must seem to Angela Merkel, the leader of Germany's opposition conservatives, who until recently appeared a sure bet to become Germany's next chancellor. <p>Back in March Merkel's Christian Democratic (CDU) party had a commanding lead in the opinion polls, registering 50% support. Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and his SPD party, which governs in a centre-left coalition with the Greens, seemed in deep trouble. </p> <p>Schr\u00f6der's attempts to reform Germany's welfare state had met with enormous opposition - not just from ordinary Germans but from leftwingers within his own party. The SPD had experienced a series of crushing election defeats. Since then, however, everything that could have gone wrong for Merkel - who took over as the Christian Democrats' leader in 2000 - has gone wrong. </p> <p>Last week Merkel's heavyweight finance spokesman and potential rival, the cerebral Friedrich Merz, announced that he was stepping down from the opposition front bench. This week Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, a former interior minister and the CDU's main foreign policy expert, turned down Merkel's offer of Merz's old job. </p> <p>Germany's bestselling tabloid Bild was blunt. Yesterday it described the move as \"Sch\u00e4uble's cold revenge on Merkel\". The politician had snubbed Merkel because of her failure earlier this year to support his bid to become Germany's president, it speculated.</p> <p>The opinion polls, meanwhile, have shown a decline in CDU support - from 50% in March to 40% in October. Schr\u00f6der's ratings have, unexpectedly, recovered, with his SPD now on 30%. </p> <p>Suddenly, what appeared unthinkable earlier this year now seems tantalisingly possible - Schr\u00f6der, and Joschka Fischer, Germany's Green foreign minister, could win an unprecedented third time when Germany next goes to the polls in 2006. </p> <p>The reasons for Merkel's recent difficulties appear to be various, but most pundits agree that in the end it all comes down to power. </p> <p>A Protestant who grew up in communist East Germany, Merkel does not share the same background as most of her male CDU colleagues, who tend to come from the mainly Catholic states in former West Germany. </p> <p>Some party officials have admitted that there is now a whispering campaign against her led by what Der Spiegel has dubbed the federal princes - regional leaders such as Roland Koch, Christian Wulff, and Peter M\u00fcller - all of whom appear to want Merkel's job. </p> <p>But Merkel's most deadly rival is Edmund Stoiber, the leader of the CDU's Bavarian sister party the CSU. Stoiber was the conservative opposition candidate during Germany's last general election in 2002. He lost, but appears determined to become the \"Kanzlerkandidat\" again.</p> <p>Earlier this year he witheringly dismissed Merkel and her liberal coalition partner Guido Westerwelle as \"Leichtmatrozen\" or lightweights - literally light sailors - and compared them unflatteringly with the heavyweight duo of Schr\u00f6der and Fischer. </p> <p>Both the CDU and CSU, meanwhile, have been at odds for more than a year over the issue of how to reform Germany's health insurance system. But the row is less about health than about the increasingly glacial rivalry between Merkel and Stoiber, and the unresolved question of who gets to challenge Schr\u00f6der next time round.</p> <p> In an interview over the weekend Merkel struck a phlegmatic note. \"After 15 years in politics I'm over the phase where things really surprise me,\" she told Der Spiegel. </p> <p>It is too early to write off Merkel, who has been inaccurately, and unhelpfully, compared by both the German and the British press to Margaret Thatcher. But if she is to survive the latest round of sniping from her own knife-wielding colleagues she could do worse than to adopt one of Thatcher's less loveable traits - her ruthlessness.</p>",
  "<b>Home-sellers packs</b> <br> Government plans for compulsory home-sellers packs moved a step further when a bid to block them was defeated. Voting in the Lords was 154 to 131 amid Tory protests that the proposals would be a \"poll tax on moving home\" and force vendors to pay up to \u00a31,000 to put their property in the estate agent's window. <p>But, during the housing bill's report stage, the deputy prime minister's office minister Lord Rooker said the plans were backed by the Consumers Association. He rejected claims that packs would cost \u00a31,000 and said Britain's biggest mortgage lender HBOS and its largest estate agent Countrywide were \"gearing up\" for them. </p> <p>Lord Hanningfield, for the Tories, said his party backed a voluntary scheme but it was necessary to take the compulsory element out of the bill. </p> <p><b>Iran</b><br> Time is running out for Iran to avoid referral to the UN security council over its failure to comply with nuclear obligations, international security minister Denis MacShane warned. He said the International Atomic Energy Agency had documented \"serious failings\" by Iran over 18 years to meet safeguards and transparency obligations. This has led to widespread concern about its ambitions. </p> <p><b>Westminster security</b><br> Parliament is to get a dedicated \"security coordinator\" after a series of security breaches by protesters. The appointment has been agreed in principle by the committee in charge of the running of the Commons, its spokesman Liberal Democrat Sir Archy Kirkwood said. The decision had been made after the Commons commission considered a report by police and security services. </p> <p><b>UK troops</b><br> It would be quite unacceptable for UK troops to be deployed to Baghdad under US command, Lord Watson, for the Liberal Democrats, said. He warned the government \"that the credibility of its policy on Iraq is eroded with every day of the continuing violence\". </p> <p>Foreign Office minister Lady Symons said: \"The credibility of the government on this issue, and the way it has conducted itself, has been examined by four separate committees. On each occasion the government has been acquitted of any wrongdoing, on the question of good faith.\" </p> <p><b>Company audits</b><br> Audit firms should be allowed to protect themselves from massive compensation claims for failing to spot problems in company accounts, Andrew Mitchell, for Tories, said. He proposed a raft of measures, including a cap of 20 times the fee, as MPs put the finishing touches to measures aimed at preventing an Enron-style scandal in the UK. </p> <p>Trade and industry minister Jacqui Smith said: \"If a proper package of reforms can be constructed in time, the government will aim to consult further next year on the detail of proposals to be included in a forthcoming companies bill.\" </p> <p>The companies (audit, investigation and community enterprise) bill, part of the government's strategy to help restore investor confidence in companies and financial markets after major corporate failures, gained its third reading and cleared the Commons. </p> <p><b>Uninsured drivers</b><br> A crackdown on uninsured drivers is expected to be included in the next parliamentary session, junior transport minister David Jamieson said. He told MPs ministers hoped to bring forward a bill, including giving police powers to seize and destroy uninsured vehicles. </p> <p><b>Wheelchair access</b><br> A wheelchair-bound MP told how she was forced to travel in the guards' van of a train which was \"little better than a cattle truck\". Labour's Anne Begg said the \"barbaric practice\" took place last Tuesday when she caught a Southern slam-door service from London Bridge. The Mark 1 rolling stock should have been phased out at the end of this year but three companies, including Southern, have asked to carry on using it into 2005. </p> <p>Rail minister Charlotte Atkins said: \"It is absolutely ridiculous in this day and age that anyone should have to travel in this way. It is unacceptable.\" She said the practice will end as new rolling stock comes in. </p> <p><b>Royal train</b><br> The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, confirmed the government had no plans to scrap the Royal train. Tory transport spokesman Greg Knight pointed to its \"historic and national\" significance and asked: \"Will you confirm to the House that you have no short term, medium term or long term plans to scrap the Royal train?\" </p> <p>As Labour's Dennis Skinner shouted: \"I hope he has,\" Mr Darling replied: \"Not only that but I think it is only recently that the Royal Family confirmed they wished to maintain and use the Royal train - and I am sure they will continue to do so.\" </p> <p><b>Heart disease</b><br> People suffering from congenital heart disease should not have to pay for their prescriptions, Labour's Ivan Henderson urged. He added: \"Avoiding cigarettes, alcohol or junk food will not offer them the level of health that most of us take for granted.\" His congenital heart disease (exemption from prescription charges) bill gained its first reading but stands no chance of becoming law. </p> <p><b>Alan Milburn</b><br> Labour's general election coordinator, Alan Milburn, was challenged over his appointment to the cabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Julian Lewis, for the Tories, criticised the decision to split the job previously performed by Douglas Alexander, who was not a member of the cabinet, into two posts - Mr Milburn's and that of Cabinet Office minister Ruth Kelly. </p> <p>Mr Lewis told Ms Kelly: \"You may only have half the job title but I'm sure you'll be doing all the work.\" Mr Milburn, appearing at question time for the first time in his new role, said Tory allegations that his job was a waste of public money were \"rather absurd\". He added to Mr Lewis: \"With you it's not so much a question of the poisoned chalice as the poison.\" </p> <p><b>Bats</b><br> Historic churches should be exempt from laws which prevent them from taking action against protected bat species which threaten their closure, the government was urged. Tory John Greenway said bats were \"wreaking havoc\" in churches across Britain, including the 1,000-year-old Saxon church of St Hilda's in Ellerburn in his Ryedale constituency. </p> <p>Nature conservation minister Ben Bradshaw said that under existing laws churches could apply for government licences which would allow them to move the bats. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The prime minister and the Tory leader, Michael Howard, face each other at Commons question time. Earlier, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, responds to MPs. The house considers Lords amendments to the armed forces (pensions and compensation) bill. There is a debate on the national service framework for children, young people and maternity. Topics of backbench debates in Westminster Hall include UK citizens detained by the US immigration service and the defence ministry military records office. </p> <p>The Lords debates the housing bill's report stage and legal services and Northern Ireland orders.</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow has become the latest well-known figure to find himself at the centre of dirty tricks allegations against Richard and Judy. </p> <p>Matthew Wright, host of the eponymous Five show, has accused rivals Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan of resorting to underhand tactics to ensure Snow appeared first on their show. </p> <p>The Channel 4 news anchor was due to appear on Wright's morning show on Monday to plug his new book, but was forced to change the time of his appearance when producers on the Richard and Judy show found out.</p> <p>They had booked Snow hours later for their teatime show on Monday but, according to Wright, when the programme-makers found out he had scooped them, Richard and Judy's representatives got on the phone immediately to threaten repercussions.</p> <p>He claims they threatened not just to cancel Snow's interview on Richard and Judy but to extend the ban to include any other authors published by his publisher, HarperCollins.</p> <p>The celebrity guest war shows not just the intense rivalry between chat shows, but the influence Richard and Judy's book club has gained among publishers.</p> <p>At the press launch of the new Richard and Judy Wine Club last night, Finnigan insisted her show did not threaten to ban guests if they didn't appear on it first.</p> <p>\"I can understand book publishers trying to get on our show, but I do not think that [we threatened a ban] is true.\"</p> <p>Executive producer Amanda Ross hit out at Wright, a former showbusiness journalist, claiming he was just out to get free publicity. </p> <p>\"It is rubbish. We would never say that. I wish there were so many celebrities in this country that you could afford to ban anyone,\" she said.</p> <p>Earlier this week Paul O'Grady, who has just launched a rival teatime show on ITV, claimed in the Daily Mirror that guest bookers for Richard and Judy had also threatened a three-year ban of authors if guests refused to appear on their show first. This was after Joan Collins was booked to appear on his show ahead of Richard and Judy.</p> <p>\"Tom Cruise I could understand, Joan Collins perhaps, but Jon Snow on a Monday morning seems a little heavy-handed. They must be really desperate to worry about little old me,\" said Wright. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for HarperCollins confirmed that Snow's Wright appearance was moved but denied any threats were made. </p> <p>\"It didn't come to that. He was going to do the Wright show but they [Richard and Judy] demanded exclusivity. As a consequence we thought we'd move it on this occasion,\" she said. </p> <p>Snow will now appear on Wright's show this coming Monday, following his appearance on Richard and Judy's sofa on Monday night to promote his new autobiography, Shooting History: a Personal Journey. </p> <p>The husband and wife team, who presided over ITV's This Morning for more than a decade before defecting to Channel 4, hold immense power over the publishing industry after the launch of their phenomenally popular book club strand. </p> <p>Nigel Newton, the chairman and chief executive of Harry Potter publishers Bloomsbury, said last month that sales of books that had appeared on the show had been considerably boosted, with sales of one title rocketing by 300%.</p> <p>Rival broadcasters suspect that Madeley and Finnigan are using their new-found promotional power to dictate terms to authors and celebrities. </p> <p>Their Oprah Winfrey-style book club, which made its debut in the spring, has had a huge impact on the book charts. </p> <p>Sales of Joseph O'Connor's Star of the Sea rocketed from 1,000 copies a week to more than 30,000 after it was featured on the programme. It is the biggest selling title of 2004 so far and is being turned into a film by Working Title, which adapted Bridget Jones's Diary.</p> <p>A spokesman for the show confirmed that the pair demanded exclusivity from their guests but vigorously denied claims that anyone on the show would have threatened to blacklist an entire roster of authors. </p> <p>He said they were happy to take guests who had appeared over the weekend but they drew the line there.</p> <p>\"We don't follow anyone apart from Jonathan Ross or Michael Parkinson, because they're in different timeslots. We're quite open and upfront about that,\" said the spokesman. </p> <p>\"Our policy is first or different - the guests have to be on first or for completely different reasons - but we would never make any threats like that with a stable of talent or authors.\"</p> <p>This year the show has had a number of big interviews - Cherie Blair talked exclusively to them while Rebecca Loos appeared on the show after her kiss and tell with Sky's Kay Burley.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "A French school yesterday expelled two girls for wearing Muslim headscarves in the first such case since a ban on religious symbols was imposed in state schools last month. <p>The two seventh-grade pupils, aged 12 and 13, had refused to remove their headscarves since school resumed in September, despite repeated meetings teachers held with them and their parents, said the school principal in Mulhouse, eastern France. \"The disciplinary council has decided to definitively exclude the two pupils from the school,\" Michelle Feder-Cunin said. </p> <p>France imposed the ban in September to reassert the neutrality of its state schools and counter what teachers said was rising Islamist radicalism reflected in the wearing of headscarves, denial of the Holocaust and attacks on Jewish schoolmates. </p> <p>The law barred what it called conspicuous signs of faith such as the headscarves, Jewish skullcaps and large Christian crosses but left some leeway - such as discreet jewellery - because a complete ban would have violated European human rights laws. </p> <p>The French education minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, said about 70 girls around the country risked expulsion by refusing to bare their heads despite warnings from school officials. </p> <p>Three Sikh boys in a Paris suburb are also fighting the ban because it would mean taking off their turbans, he said, adding: \"The law applies to everybody.\" </p> <p>Pupils expelled from school can either attend private schools, which are fee-paying, or continue their education through correspondence courses. </p> <p>Lazhar Fortas, a French citizen of Algerian origin whose daughter Khouloude was one of the two expelled, told Reuters he could not understand how the school could shut her out. </p> <p>\"She was a top student last year, first in her class, she had no problems, she went to gym class, did everything, was even her class delegate,\" he said.</p>",
  "Ramsay MacDonald, the Labour prime minister who in 1931 entered with the Tories into a national coalition government, was left so helpless that he could not even persuade his Conservative home secretary to release a veteran leader of the hunger marches from prison. <p>Home Office files released today at the National Archives at Kew show that MacDonald was \"broken-hearted\" over his failure to secure the release of the veteran trade union agitator Tom Mann, a leader of the 1889 \"great dock strike\" and a founder of the Transport and General Workers' Union. </p> <p>MacDonald, still reviled in some leftwing circles as a class traitor, was abandoned by most of his Labour colleagues and by the Liberals, when as Labour prime minister in 1931 he accepted George V's invitation to head a coalition government with the Tories during the economic slump. </p> <p>Home Office files released today show that in office he became powerless even to insist on the just treatment of the communist leaders of the hunger marches - though some of them had been close colleagues in the founding years of the Labour party. </p> <p>The files also show Winston Churchill was so alarmed when the first hunger marches were organised by the National Unemployed Workers' Movement (NUMW) - a British Communist party front organisation - that he demanded they should be stopped from reaching London. </p> <p>The first marches took place in 1927, and Churchill, then chancellor, told the home secretary he was concerned that those taking part were getting into \"a very distressed condition\" and thought their arrival in London, \"footsore and hungry,\" would create a difficult situation. He wanted them intercepted while some distance from London, \"treated decently and tactfully, but turned back somehow or other\". </p> <p>The Home Office was apparently not very interested, regarding them more as figures of farce than dangerous revolutionaries. MI5 reports said the Lancashire group had proved the most difficult: they had demanded hotpot when they reached Manchester and had to be dispersed with a hose. </p> <p>The chief constable of Reading described them as \"rather a weedy lot\", and the Metropolitan police said they had \"no great anxiety\" about the arrivals. But as unemployment mounted and the marches became a regular feature in British life, attitudes hardened. </p> <p>In the winter of 1932 the biggest of the hunger marches ended in a 200,000-strong demonstration in Trafalgar Square and brutal clashes with the police, and the leaders of the NUWM were arrested, including Tom Mann, 76. </p> <p>He and the NUWM treasurer, Emrys Llewellyn, were imprisoned for two months after refusing to be bound over to keep the peace under a statute dating back to the 14th century. The 1932 MI5 file describes Mann as an \"extremely active revolutionary agitator,\" who had \"taken part in almost every industrial dispute of any magnitude since 1881\" and had been at the \"forefront of every militant campaign undertaken in this country\". </p> <p>A widely supported \"Free Tom Mann\" campaign attracted the support of the former home secretary in the second Labour government, John Clynes, and when George Lansbury, leader of what was left of the Labour party, went to see MacDonald at Hillocks, his Scottish home in Lossiemouth on the Moray Firth, he was seen as an \"old friend\". </p> <p>MacDonald was particularly concerned that Clynes and his own Free Church had protested over the case. \"You know perfectly well there is this great plan for disturbing the country, taking advantage of the most distressing state of unemployment, which seems to be baffling everybody, but which we are working away at as best we can,\" he told Lansbury. </p> <p>\"We know Moscow plans. We know they are going to try and bring about communism in this country. Communism to me is a mere name. They are going to use the unemployed and they have them as a nuclei ... but people who are officials of an organisation must bear the brunt of the action of their organisation.\" </p> <p>He told Lansbury they were \"old friends\", but he had to understand the difficulties of cabinet government and the country was in \"a too troubled state\" for him simply to resign and not to take any responsibility for it. But in a letter to the Conservative home secretary, Sir John Gilmour, asking for the men's release, MacDonald admitted, in a passage he later crossed out, that he was \"suffering from a broken heart\" over the affair. </p> <p>But the home secretary refused to act on the private request from the prime minister: \"There is grave reason to believe this communist organisation is up to its old tricks,\" he told MacDonald. </p> <p>\"You suggested that now that the law has been vindicated these two people might perhaps be let out of prison as proof there was no vindictiveness ... I have no doubt whatever that in present circumstances it would be the worst of all possible courses.\"</p>",
  "<p>The education secretary, Charles Clarke, is today expected to reassure England's directors of social services that his five-year plan to reform secondary schools will not undermine child welfare reforms.</p> <p>In a speech to the National Social Services Conference in Newcastle, Mr Clarke will address concerns that the education strategy, which will give schools more autonomy and control over pupil selection, goes against the wider reforms to integrate children's services in a bid to tackle social exclusion.</p> <p>Andrew Cozens, the outgoing president of the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS), said the education secretary was expected to reassure delegates that the five-year plan was \"fully hooked into Every Child Matters\" - the government's child welfare reform programme.</p> <p>The government's reforms of children's services are set to be a major theme at the conference, in particular the timetable to set up children's trusts, -which bring together education, health and social services - and to appoint children's directors, responsible for managing all local children's services.</p> <p>Social services directors will also be looking for reassurances from the health secretary, John Reid, that adult social services are a priority for the Department of Health.

  "'We are trying to create walled gardens to tidy up the jungle we have at the moment, if you'll excuse the mixed metaphor,\" one government source said yesterday as ministers struggled to explain the most sweeping changes to Britain's gambling laws in a generation. The slightly confusing choice of words highlights the immense challenge facing ministers as they square up against a formidable alliance of religious group, the Tories and most newspapers. <p>Amid reports that multi-million pound US corporations are already waving fat cheque books in front of local authorities in the hope of winning licences for new \"Las Vegas-style\" casinos, opponents have warned of an explosion in gambling. </p> <p>Ministers insist that one of their main ambitions is to offer greater protection to addicts. </p> <p>To achieve this, they are proposing to liberalise the law - a tricky one to sell. Alarmed by the proliferation of fixed odd betting machines, ministers have decided to ban them from 6,000 unregulated locations such as bookies, late night taxi offices and British Legion halls. Ministers said that gamblers must be allowed to use the machines to avoid the risk of their owners going underground. So owners of the new large casinos will be free to set up the machines. </p> <p>One government source said: \"Our critics have looked at the two to three bits of the bill where we are easing the rules without looking at how we are tightening the system. We have to live in the real world or gambling will just go underground.\" </p> <p>But Jonathan Lomax, of the Salvation Army, said: \"There are only two real winners that will benefit from the liberalisation of gambling laws - the gaming industry through massively increased profits, and the government through increased taxation.\" </p> <p>The casinos will be allowed to offer unlimited jackpots and to stay open 24 hours a day. There will be no limit on the number of \"supersized\" regional casinos, though the government thinks market forces will keep it between 20 and 40. The largest casinos will be allowed to have as many as 1,250 machines, meaning an extra 25- 50,000 machines in total. </p> <p>A new industry regulator, the Gambling Commission, which replaces the Gaming Board of Great Britain, will ensure that the casinos operate within a strict framework. The commission will have new powers to investigate, prosecute, enter premises, seize goods, void bets, levy unlimited fines and remove gambling licences. </p> <p>It will also monitor levels of problem gambling, and publish a social responsibility code while the industry will have to pay \u00a33m a year towards research into addiction. </p> <p>\"The commission will offer carrots and sticks,\" the government source said. \"There are incentives if the casinos behave well. If they are bad, they will be belted.\" </p> <p>Local authorities will have the power to licence gambling premises, and to resolve not to allow new casinos in their area, enabling local communities to have their say in where they should appear. </p> <p>A \"triple lock\" will be applied on any application for a regional casino, with them having to gain a suitability licence from the commission; then an agreement from a regional planning body; and then planning permission from the local authority, who will be able to hold referenda on whether this should take place. </p> <p>Children, who are currently able to wander into minicab offices and play on unregulated slot machines, will be given greater protection. There will be a new offence of inviting, permitting or causing anyone aged under 18 to gamble. But anyone under 18 may enter bingo premises, the betting area of a horse racecourse or greyhound track, or the non-gambling area of a regional casino. </p> <p>Ministers know that they have been placed on the back foot by the force of the campaign against the reforms, which includes the argument that there has already been a surge in internet betting. </p> <p>But the government believes this depiction of the internet highlights the flaw in its opponents' thinking. </p> <p>One of the reforms will try to regulate internet betting for the first time. Companies will have to gain remote licences from the new commission if they want to be based in Britain.

  "<p>The family of a young woman who was shot dead in her car last year have joined police to make a powerful radio advertisement as part of a new campaign to stamp out gun crime among London's black communities. </p> <p>Pauline Peart, a 25-year-old bank worker with no criminal background, was killed by a single bullet as she sat at the wheel of her Audi sports car in Tottenham on March 10 2003. This month, Maurice Miller, 21, and Nebra Bennett, 24, were jailed for life for her murder. </p> <p>It was the first murder of a female dealt with by Scotland Yard's Trident unit, set up four years ago to investigate gun crime in the capital's black communities, most of it drugs-linked. </p> <p>Detective Chief Superintendent John Coles, operational head of Trident, said his officers were succeeding in gaining the trust of communities. There had been a big rise in the number of people, many outraged by shootings of children and innocent bystanders, prepared to pass on intelligence or make witness statements. </p> <p>He said Trident's murder clear-up rate was now almost 100%, compared with 25% five or six years ago. But there was no room for complacency. </p> <p>Yesterday, the Metropolitan police launched a new push, with posters, flyers, radio ads and a new website, <a href=\"http://www.stoptheguns.org/\">www.stoptheguns.org</a>, to encourage more people to shop gunmen and weapons suppliers. There are even messages specific to the five Trident hotspot boroughs - Brent, Hackney, Haringey, Lambeth and Southwark - on 1,500 petrol pump nozzles, for example: \"The only trigger that should be pulled in Hackney.\" </p> <p>The campaign has gained added poignancy after the re cent murder of Danielle Beccan, 14, in Nottingham, and the shooting of an 18-month-old baby girl in Hackney, east London, last week. </p> <p>Shirley Peart, Pauline's mother, who speaks in the radio advert about the devastating effects of her daughter's murder, said: \"We want to stop more people getting hurt. Perhaps people will listen to us because they know what our family has been through. Our hope is that people will do something positive to help the community.\" </p> <p>Mr Coles said people who phoned the Crimestoppers helpline were guaranteed anonymity, and would not be recorded or traced, and Trident did its best to ensure witnesses' safety, though there were different ways to do this. </p> <p>\"Pro rata, Trident has more people in witness protection than any other unit in the Met,\" he said. \"But the community banding together and saying we will not tolerate these people being hurt can be more effective than moving them 15 miles up the road.\" </p> <p>It was a myth that Jamaican Yardie gangsters were behind all gun crime, Mr Coles said. About 80% was down to young London-born black men, shooting people in their own or neighbouring boroughs. \"This is a problem that has 'Made in Britain' stamped all the way through it,\" said Lee Jasper, chair of the Trident independent advisory group. </p> <p>Mr Jasper said that community co-operation with the police was vital. But he insisted that the government must do more to tackle \"pockets of hopelessness\" where young black people, with few educational or job prospects, were easily seduced by a \"high octane\" lifestyle funded by drug dealing. </p> <p>Mr Coles said that last year police had concentrated particularly on gun conversion factories. This year, with evidence of gunmen turning away from converted replicas to high precision Smith &amp; Wesson handguns and heavy duty MAC submachine guns, the focus is on gunmen and weapons suppliers. </p> <p>From January 1 to September 30 this year, there were 10 murders and 18 attempted murders within Trident's remit, compared with 13 and 29 respectively for the same nine months last year, and 16 and 47 in 2002. The overall number of shootings by September 30 this year was 121, compared with 136 for the same period in 2003, and 154 in 2002. </p> <p>Between January and September this year, 178 people were charged with Trident-related offences, and police recovered 77 guns, 376 rounds of ammunition, \u00a3400,000 cash, and 100 kilos of class A drugs.</p>",
  "<p>So, the single is dead. Surely that's bad news for radio. Hold on a second, that's bad news for me ... </p> <p>I can always go back to McDonald's, given my two years' experience, and there's a monthly radio diary I do for a newspaper called the Guardian. It doesn't pay much, but it's a start. Still, I'll have to sell the holiday home in St Lucia and the Winnebago. Trust me, if that was the truth I wouldn't be writing about it today. Here's the story ... </p> <p>Last Sunday, Call On Me by Eric Pridz went back to the top of the official UK charts, despite the fact it sold fewer copies than a stall punting anti-war T-shirts at the gates of Downing Street. </p> <p>Now, it was a very slow week for releases, but it's probably a taste of things to come. However, to quote Lance Corporal Jack Jones, \"Don't panic!\" </p> <p>Back in the day, you could buy six singles for the price of one album, whereas today most singles cost \u00a33.99. Therefore, it makes sense to spend a few more quid on albums, sales of which are thriving. Record companies (and supermarkets) have cottoned on to this and are selling remarkable, ground-breaking new long players for a tenner, or thereabouts. Three years ago, you'd have been lucky to bag Black Lace's Greatest Hits for that. </p> <p>Above all else, though, it's the untapped and out-of-control Download Generation that's decimating single sales. </p> <p>CD Burners are now standard with new PCs and the likes of iPods and iRivers (don't ask) are commonplace on the hip of today's youth. </p> <p>On Radio 1, we have special album chart features and the first ever official download chart, but it's the stuff we're stealing from the net that's really damaging the legacy of the single. Personally, I'll be glad to see this wave of virtual theft curbed, but the rebel in me quite enjoys seeing the big record companies squirm. To quote that man again, \"They don't like it up 'em.'\" </p> <p>It's a difficult issue but you shouldn't leave your car door open if you want to hold on to it and, at the moment, it takes serious morals for a teenager to resist the temptation to click that mouse. </p> <p>So, with all this in mind, is there a point to singles any more? In short, yes. </p> <p>This format is still the shop window for any new band to be discovered. They, along with their record company, decide on what track they'd like to represent them. The public fall in love with music in a second, after turning on the radio and hearing an outfit for the first time. The single remains the ultimate promotional tool. </p> <p>People are not losing interest in singles; they are just attaining them in different ways. </p> <p>And anyway, if Radio 1 didn't play the best new music before anyone else, then how would the kids know what to steal from the internet? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Colin and Edith are on Radio 1 every weekday, 1-4pm</p>",
  "<p>Reuters offered signs that its recovery programme was on track yesterday when the group reported positive net sales for the first time in more than three years. Its shares rose 8.5% to 350.5p, making it the FTSE 100's best performer.</p> <p>Analysts and shareholders welcomed news that there were more sales than cancellations in the three months to the end of September. Underlying revenues at the media and information group, which lag behind sales by between one and three months, declined by a better-than-expected 4.4% to \u00a3528m.</p> <p>On an actual basis, sales still fell 13% to \u00a3570m, compared with \u00a3658m in the same period last year. In the third quarter of 2000, before the recession in the financial services sector and the downturn following September 11, Reuters made \u00a3888m in the third quarter.</p> <p>The downturn prompted the group to launch a big restructuring exercise and \u00a3440m cost-cutting programme two years ago.</p> <p>Executives were wary of making further positive forecasts yesterday, partly because of economic factors outside their control. They predicted the gradual improvement in revenue decline to continue in 2005, with a total fall of 3% this year.</p> <p>The group has failed to rule out further job cuts.</p> <p>David Grigson, the finance director, said: \"We remain reasonably cautious. We will have [put] our own service into shape ... but we still need some level of market improvement to nudge us into positive territory.\"</p> <p>More than 80% of the company's revenues comes from selling information to the financial services sector. Mr Grigson said that the next three months - encompassing the all-important year-end - would be critical for banks and other financial institutions. \"Partly because it's so finely balanced, it's difficult to predict.\"</p> <p>Analysts echoed this caution. Colin Tennant at Lehman Brothers said: \"If sales and revenues continue to improve at their current rate, they will be positive in 2005, but only just.\"</p>",
  "<p>The fight for control of South African mining group Gold Fields entered a second round yesterday when predator Harmony launched a whirlwind tour to drum up support from shareholders in Johannesburg, London and New York. </p> <p>Ian Cockerill, Gold Fields' chief executive, responded with a spirited defence of his alternative merger strategy, involving Iamgold of Canada, and claimed his shareholders were \"angry\" about the Harmony offer. </p> <p>The gold sector burst into life on Monday when Harmony revealed details of an $8bn (\u00a34.4bn) all-share offer for Gold Fields and said it had already won support from Russia's Norilsk Nickel, a 20% shareholder in Gold Fields. </p> <p>But the proposal was dismissed by the Gold Fields board as \"significantly\" undervaluing its high quality portfolio of assets. </p> <p>The rebuff triggered a frenzy of activity, with Harmony chief executive Bernard Swanepoel holding discussions in South Africa with shareholders of both Harmony and Gold Fields. </p> <p>Meanwhile his marketing director, Ferdi Dippenaar, took a plane to Britain for talks. He sets off for the US today to try to win Wall Street backing for the Gold Fields takeover. </p> <p>\"We are talking to top shareholders from both companies and are confident we have a strong story to tell. We expect to post a [formal] offer document as early as [today],\" said a Harmony spokesman. </p> <p>Mr Cockerill insisted his shareholders supported the board's decision to press ahead with the $2bn Iamgold merger. \"They are very concerned about a potential value destruction that could be taking place ... There's a high degree of anger,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Gold Fields is treating the Harmony offer as a hostile bid; it is definitely not a friendly merger offer,\" he added. Gold Fields had an agreement to take control of Iamgold for an 11% premium, which was \"incredibly low\", according to Mr Cockerill. Gold Fields would also be able to take advantage of cheaper access to capital markets through a North American listing, he added. </p> <p>The Gold Fields boss claimed the Harmony offer was made at a 7% premium to Gold Fields' share price last Friday. But Harmony claims the premium was 29% - based on the day before - when rumours of a deal had started circulating. </p> <p>Harmony shares yesterday put on 1.6% to 76.70 rand after sliding 9.6% on Monday. Gold Fields shares rose 1.8% to 93.65 rand.</p>",
  "<p>The ailing J Sainsbury supermarket empire yesterday admitted it could be heading for its first loss in 135 years as it spelled out a strategy U-turn in an attempt to restore the jaded grocer's fortunes. </p> <p>Chief executive Justin King is to plough \u00a3400m of cost-savings into improving food quality and cutting prices as the battered chain tries to compete with market leaders Tesco and Asda and reassert its position as middle England's favourite grocer. \"This business does have problems\", he said yesterday, \"but I have seen nothing that can't be fixed.\" </p> <p>He is also cutting 750 head office jobs to save cash and hiring an additional 3,000 staff to improve service levels in the group's 721 stores. Other moves include halving the dividend paid to shareholders, rolling back plans to sell a wide variety of homewares and re-opening an old depot to help get goods into the shops and \"save Christmas\". </p> <p>Mr King said it would take more than three years for his plan - which is based on boosting sales at a rate not seen for many years - to work. It will cost \u00a3550m, mostly related to shutting down grandiose computer and supply systems installed by previous chief executive Sir Peter Davis. </p> <p>The state of the art systems have turned out to be white elephants, leaving shelves empty and pushing customers to other stores. In-store availability is now worse than before Sir Peter spent \u00a33bn on automated depots to improve it. Sir Peter was ousted in July in a shareholder revolt after being awarded a \u00a32.3m performance bonus. </p> <p>Mr King's long-awaited business review repeatedly suggested the supermarket had been in the hands of amateurs. In the eight-page statement setting out the changes being made, there are five references to the fact that the company now has management \"with retail expertise\". </p> <p>The new strategy affects every part of the business - from the fascias used on the high street through IT to the quality of the food on the shelves - as Mr King's new management team attempts to halt sliding sales and profits. </p> <p>The urgency of the task was underlined with new trading figures showing a further deterioration. Comparative sales excluding the benefit of rising petrol prices fell 1.1% in the last three months, against a 0.6% decline in the previous quarter. </p> <p>Mr King also produced the group's fourth profit warning since March - and his second in eight days - when he said it was unlikely to make more than \u00a3250m-\u00a3270m this year, against \u00a3686m last. </p> <p>The \u00a3550m of exceptional charges means the grocer could be heading for its first loss since it was founded in 1869 - even after banking \u00a3275m from the sale of American offshoot Shaw's. </p> <p>The central plank of the new Sainsbury's strategy is to increase sales by \u00a32.5bn in the next three years. Mr King said he expected \u00a3400m of that to come from convenience stores, \u00a3700m from better homewares and the rest from groceries. The rise is 17% more than last year's sales. </p> <p>Improving availability, he said, is the number one priority and 50% of the problem could be solved in-store, suggesting food has been piling up in stockrooms. He has hired distribution specialist Lawrence Christensen, formerly of Safeway, to sort out the problems. </p> <p>\"He said he hasn't found any problems he hasn't encountered before,\" said Mr King. \"He just hasn't found them all at the same time in the same place.\" The Central and Savacentre trading names are to be abandoned and 130 stores updated. The food quality, he said, would be better. \"People will be able to taste the difference. They will notice.\" </p> <p>Mr King acknowledged that his rivals would fight back but insisted his plans would work: \"I am completely confident ... we will deliver success.\" The City was less sure. The shares, which have been constantly buoyed up by takeover talk, closed up 7p at 249p, but many analysts believe there are big risks Mr King will not deliver his promised improvements. </p> <p>Richard Ratner at Seymour Pierce described the new strategy as \"all good stuff\", but added: \"There is no certainty that it will bear fruit.\" He advised shareholders to sell. Iain McDonald of broker Numis said Mr King may not be given the time he needs, especially by the Sainsbury family, who still control 34% of the shares. </p> <p><strong>Cash that chain has been forced to write off</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a3140m<br> IT write-off </strong> Outsourcing deal set up in 2000 with Accenture has not delivered benefits.

  "<p>A British woman who has devoted most of her life to caring for the people of Iraq became the latest victim of Baghdad's ruthless kidnap gangs yesterday. </p> <p>Video footage of Margaret Hassan, looking tired and drawn with her hands tied behind her back, was shown on an Arabic television channel. The Iraqi director of the charity Care International, 52, was kidnapped at around 7.30am on her way to work in the Khadra district of western Baghdad. </p> <p>Her capture comes two weeks after the murder of Ken Bigley, the Liverpool engineer who was kidnapped in Baghdad and beheaded by Tawhid and Jihad, the militants led by the Jordanian extremist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. </p> <p>Wearing a cream shirt, Ms Hassan was shown on the video apparently talking, although no sound could be heard. The tape also showed Ms Hassan's identity papers and a credit card. Unlike most of the previous videos of kidnappings in Iraq, no militants or banners appeared. </p> <p>It was not clear last night who had abducted Ms Hassan or why. Her husband told the television station al-Jazeera from Baghdad that his wife had been driving to work when she was kidnapped. </p> <p>\"When my wife was approaching her office, two cars surrounded her vehicle. The kidnappers attacked the driver and took control of her car, driving off with her to an unknown destination,\" Tahseen Ali Hassan said. </p> <p>\"We haven't heard anything about the group and no one has contacted us,\" he said. </p> <p>The station said the footage of Ms Hassan was accompanied by a claim of responsibility from an unnamed Iraqi group. It was received \"through the usual channels\", a spokesman said. </p> <p>Born in Dublin but married to an Iraqi and holding both Iraqi and British passports, Ms Hassan, who has lived in the country for more than 25 years, was a vociferous opponent of the sanctions that starved the Iraqi people of food, water and medical supplies after the war in 1991 and last year's invasion. Friends say she speaks Arabic with an Iraqi accent and considers herself Iraqi. </p> <p>Care is one of the few charities still operating in Iraq after the abduction last month of two Italian aid workers. Both women were later freed after a ransom was paid. </p> <p>Tony Blair said the government would do everything it could to secure Ms Hassan's release. \"This is someone who has lived in Iraq for 30 years, someone who is immensely respected, someone who is doing her level best to help the country,\" he said. \"It shows you the type of people we are up against, that they are prepared to kidnap somebody like this.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Care said in a statement: \"As of now we are unaware of the motive for the abduction. As far as we know, Margaret is unharmed. Needless to say, we are doing whatever we can to secure her release.\" Felicity Arbuthnot, an Irish freelance journalist who has known Ms Hassan for 15 years, said she was much-loved in Iraq: \"She could go anywhere and didn't need a minder, even if she was going to a place that made Sadr city look like Knightsbridge.\" </p> <p>Asked how her friend would deal with her captors, Ms Arbuthnot said: \"She'll be talking to them in Arabic, keeping her voice calm and low and she will be talking and communicating. She's very used to people who feel very alienated, very hostile and very distant.\" </p> <p>She said she hoped the prime minister would step back and allow the Irish government to lead the efforts to secure Ms Hassan's release. </p> <p>The Foreign Office said the British embassy in Baghdad was in touch with Ms Hassan's next of kin. </p> <p>The Irish foreign minister, Dermot Ahern, said his thoughts were with the Hassans: \"I stand ready to contribute in any way we can to help secure her release.\" </p> <p>Once again the kidnapping highlights the dangers for foreigners in Iraq. More than 140 have been kidnapped since April and dozens have been killed - none of them, however, foreign women. </p> <p>Ms Hassan has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of ordinary Iraqis suffering from what she believed was a \"man-made disaster\" caused by a decade of sanctions and the war that finally toppled Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>In the build-up to the war last year, she warned MPs of the humanitarian catastrophe another conflict would bring. In January 2003, she travelled to New York and spent a week briefing the members of the UN security council and UN agencies on the dire consequences of military action. </p> <p>She heads an office of 60 Iraqi charity workers, and refused to leave her team during the war. They continued to work to give hospitals essential medical supplies, such as insulin, disinfectant and blood-testing kits, while also restoring sewage systems and access to clean water. </p> <p>Ms Hassan embraced the ethos of Care, which prides itself on its policy of employing local staff. Ninety per cent of its 10,000 employees worldwide work in their home countries. </p> <p>\"We want to stress that she sees herself as an Iraqi,\" a spokeswoman for Care said. \"Iraq is her home. She has been living there for many years and would never consider coming back to Britain.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere in Iraq a mortar attack killed at least four Iraqi national guard soldiers and wounded 80 at a base north of Baghdad. An American contractor also died when mortar shells crashed into a US base in the Iraqi capital. And three car bombs exploded in the northern city of Mosul, killing two Iraqi civilians and wounding three.</p>",

From these origins came the beliefs of the neo-conservatives and their disastrous foreign policies, as well as the impetus for Islamist groups.

  "Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, is in danger of assasination at the hands of Jewish extremists, claims Shimon Peres, leader of the opposition Labour party. <p>The atmosphere in Israel was similar to the political turmoil of 1995 when the then prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was murdered by a religious nationalist, he said. </p> <p>Mr Sharon and many of his colleagues in the Likud party were at the forefront of the campaign against Mr Rabin and the Oslo peace process he was trying to push through. Now Mr Sharon has earned the hatred of the same constituency which produced Yigal Amir, who shot Rabin at a peace rally in Tel Aviv. </p> <p>Israeli settlers are opposed to Mr Sharon's plan to with draw from Gaza settlements. They believe any bid to move a Jew from his or her home is illegal, and that abandoning sovereignty over the Palestinian-dominated Gaza Strip goes against God's will. </p> <p>\"I am very fearful of the incitement, from the grave things that are again being heard,\" Mr Peres told the Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv. \"I am afraid someone will try to assassinate the prime minister. There is a lot of similarity between the situation then and today.\" </p> <p>The head of Israel's internal security agency has made similar warnings and Mr Sharon is never seen in public unless surrounded by bodyguards. </p> <p>But the public security minister, Gideon Ezra, said he was confident the state security service Shin Bet had learned the lessons of the Rabin killing. </p> <p>\"I think it's much harder to get to the prime minister than it used to be, and therefore I am less concerned than I used to be,\" said Mr Ezra, a former deputy chief of the Shin Bet. </p> <p>Threats to Mr Sharon's safety are just one obstacle to his disengagement plan. On Monday more rabbis called on soldiers to disobey orders if they were told to evacuate settlers from the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>Avraham Shapira, a former chief rabbi of Israel, said last week the planned withdrawal violated Jewish law. </p> <p>In a statement signed by 60 other rabbis, Mr Shapira said observant soldiers should not take part in the removal s. </p> <p>Many of the 7,000-8,000 settlers are likely to take compensation and move on, but a large minority could resist.</p>",
  "<p>So, there was no big idea, no revolutionary retailing concept, no quick fix, no certainty and no chance of anything very noticeable happening in the very near future. </p> <p>This was the much-anticipated business review - entitled Making Sainsbury's Great Again - announced by Justin King. </p> <p>The alternative view, of course, is that there are no big ideas, quick fixes etc and Mr K is merely being realistic and playing the hand he was dealt in the most straightforward and sensible manner. So it is back to basics. Forget the \u00a33bn sprayed around by Sir Peter Davis on robot-controlled depots that don't work, write off \u00a3550m and hire some staff to put food on the shelves. At the same time it's the usual cost cutting and squeezing suppliers to cut prices. Oh, and food quality will be improved, and home ranges downsized. </p> <p>So will the strategy work? Short term it probably can't fail to generate some improvements. </p> <p>But \u00a32.5bn of sales growth in a company that has experienced a decline in market share for 11 out of the last 12 years? That is 17% of sales - or more, in terms of volume, when prices are reduced - or 5% compound growth over the next three years. Miss year one and the run rate rises to 7%. </p> <p>And those numbers assume that neither Tesco nor Asda will launch a price war or improve their own quality in order to protect their position. </p> <p>The shares are held high only by the prospect of a takeover bid, which is probably unlikely at the current price. </p> <p>Making Sainsbury's great again? Frankly we doubt it. </p> <p><strong> Pru's Bloomers </strong><br> </p> <p> What is it about companies where Sir Peter Davis used to be boss? The Pru, his last stop before Sainsbury's, provided yesterday's shocker. Sorry we screwed up the sale of Egg, the company didn't quite say; now we're \u00a31bn short and it's a real shame because we've got some great ideas on how to spend it, so would you mind having a whip-round please? </p> <p>As a reason for a rights issue, it is not compelling, which perhaps is why the Pru chose such a thumping discount at which to price its new shares. Some 33% below the previous market price suggests extreme nervousness about how the fundraising would be received. </p> <p>Other life assurers, such as Legal &amp; General, have offered even chunkier discounts, but they weren't raising funds in such a gentle stock market climate. Moreover, the Pru is meant to be the bluest of chips in the sector. </p> <p>If the Pru was nervous, it was right to be. Last year, shareholders swallowed the first dividend cut in the company's history and they assumed that was where the pain would stop. At the very least, they expected issues of regulatory solvency to have been resolved. </p> <p>Chief executive Jonathan Bloomer's explanation is that the world - or, at least, the pension and savings market in Britain - has been transformed over the past six months. No longer is it stalked by a government intent on capping life assurers' fees. Now it is the land of opportunity where the independent advisers will fall over themselves to recruit the Pru to their \"multi-tie\" panels. </p> <p>Maybe he is right, but it will still be almost three years before the outside world can judge whether he achieves the 14% returns he is targeting for new investment in the UK. </p> <p>The underwriters - UBS, Cazenove and Goldman Sachs - will collect \u00a317m from this fundraising. Mr Bloomer should hope they spread the largesse widely among the sub-underwriting houses: there is real anger among his investors. </p> <p><strong> Ferry disaster </strong><br> </p> <p> The last thing Eurotunnel's new board needed was a burst of entrepreneurial spirit from a Dane with an Australian catamaran and an ambition to crack the cross-channel market. But SpeedFerries, which is offering return tickets for \u00a350 from Dover to Boulogne, has succeeded in piercing another hole in the tunnel's threadbare balance sheet. </p> <p>SpeedFerries' single vessel was once used to ferry troops to East Timor. Eurotunnel's abysmal third-quarter figures showed its arrival was hurting. </p> <p>Quite how Eurotunnel intends to revive its fortunes is unclear. Its market share, now 38%, is falling at a rate of knots. The new management team deserves little sympathy, having accepted a leg-up into the boardroom from a convicted fraudster, Nicolas Miguet, who stoked a shareholder rebellion by directing abuse and half-truths at the previous, British-led, board. </p> <p>However, thousands of UK shareholders still have a stake in the business. They have watched their investments fall from 38p to 20.5p since the election of the company's \"saviours\" in April. </p> <p>Herv\u00e9 Huas, who holds the unenviable position of Eurotunnel's finance director, was uninformative yesterday. He blamed the summer's dismal trading on his predecessors. He insisted a new pricing structure was on the way but refused to say whether fares will go up or down. </p> <p>Huas claimed there was no threat of lenders taking control. He maintained that a plan would be revealed to bankers by October 31. If Eurotunnel is to prosper, he needs to pull a mighty Hallowe'en pumpkin out of the bag.</p>",
  "MPs yesterday won ground in their battle to strengthen the powers of select committees when the leader of the house, Peter Hain, announced there would now be a \"presumption\" in favour of them getting the official witnesses and background briefing papers that they want to see. <p>The concession follows the Butler and Hutton inquiries, which highlighted the inability of parliament to summon powerful civil servants and ministerial special advisers. MPs felt humiliated by the inquiries' better access. </p> <p>Mr Hain's announcement yesterday was met with wary scepticism by backbenchers on both sides. They believe that non-parliamentary committees will continue to have stronger powers than parliamentary ones. </p> <p>Michael Mates, the Tory MP who sits on the intelligence and security committee (ISC) at Westminster and who served on Lord Butler's inquiry into the prewar use of intelligence, told Mr Hain that it had been much easier to get access to \"persons and papers\" on the Butler panel - and would remain so under the new rules. </p> <p>Other MPs, including the leftwinger Ian Gibson, complained that ministers would retain the ultimate right to decide which officials and documents MPs could examine. </p> <p>Alan Williams, who chairs the liaison committee before which Mr Hain made the announcement, said: \"If I were a press man writing this up I would say, 'Hain's view is that if you want a comprehensive inquiry, you have to go outside parliament.'\" </p> <p>Mr Hain paid generous tribute to MPs' efforts to hold the executive branch of government to account, and he claimed repeatedly that the current government had been more open and accountable to the Commons than any other. </p> <p>The change of rules follows Tony Blair's last appearance before the liaison committee, which consists of the chairmen of all the select committees. The prime minister signalled a willingness to let high-profile political appointees such as Alastair Campbell (who has since resigned) and the No 10 chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, appear before committees. </p> <p>Mr Campbell did eventually give evidence to the foreign affairs committee, one of two Commons inquiries into aspects of the war. But Downing Street argued that under what are known as the Osmotherly rules governing civil service conduct it was ministers who had to be accountable. </p> <p>These rules are now being rewritten to strengthen the presumption that named officials should give evidence. That does already happen, but not as much as MPs would like. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Hain warned that if background papers - advice being given to ministers - were publicly available with officials' named attached, they would \"put civil servants or special advisers in the firing line\" making them reluctant to give frank advice. </p> <p>Some reformers among MPs want to write their own version of the Osmotherly rules rather than accept Whitehall's version, which they have never formally endorsed. </p> <p>Most special advisers are a mixture of policy specialists and party workhorses doing political duties that civil servants cannot do. </p> <p>A few function as informal media advisers to ministers - spin doctors - attracting more attention from, and sometimes the resentment of, MPs. </p> <p>Dr Gibson - a biologist and critic of Prince Charles's hostility to GM crops and related developments - said he wanted the prince to give evidence to committees. </p> <p>There were cries of \"no\" from some colleagues when Dr Gibson said the prince should \"say his piece\" and be questioned. \"We might have to hire Wembley stadium,\" Dr Gibson added.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> Our old friend Jane Griffiths remains worryingly self-effacing. \"I am not aware,\" the recently deselected member for Reading East tells the local Evening Post newspaper, \"of another Reading MP in the last century who has achieved more for their constituents.\" There is plenty more - her description of the civil partnerships bill as \"Jane's Law\" stands out - but an episode at the town's Renaissance Hotel last Thursday night suggests she may still be pipped by Princess Di in a poll of most recognisable do-gooders. A cocktail party for local luminaries seemed to be going fine, until Jane sidled up to a group of strangers declaring \"don't mind me\". Having hovered for some minutes, she suddenly deployed the classic \"don't you know who I am?\" to the startled group. Duly informed, one of their number made an icebreaking joke - \"what's your day job?\" - causing the Griffiths needle to overshoot the dial, and off she stormed. Oddly, when the Diary's Simon Goodley rings her office to ask if she's feeling better, he is abused by a gentleman who will only give his name as Santa Claus, but whom cursory inquiries reveal to be Jane's husband, Andrew. Guys, if we interrupted some kind of marital game, we can only apologise. <p><b>\u00b7</b> News that David Beckham may be approached to front the PM's \"Vote Yes\" campaign for the EU constitution appears to have smoked out the geniuses on the opposing side.

There's famously a law which bans top footballers from endorsing stuff, and ... sorry, we haven't the energy. As long as the Noes now realise football is a lawless futurestate, where men rape, steal and commission witless tattoos with impunity, then perhaps it was worth it. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Much as we enjoyed Spectator media columnist Stephen Glover's article in yesterday's Mail, which concluded that Boris Johnson must resign one of his jobs, we were confused by the headline.

  "<p>John Reid, the health secretary, yesterday appointed a new chief nursing officer for England and gave her responsibility for stepping up the drive against the hospital superbug MRSA. </p> <p>After 32 years in nursing, Chris Beasley, interim head of the NHS modernisation agency, took over as head of the profession with a seat on the health department's top board. She will spearhead the introduction of a \"matron's charter\" to improve hygiene standards. </p> <p>Mr Reid said the charter was \"a 21st century work plan for hospitals' cleanliness, based on a 19th century instruction from Florence Nightingale\". She established a founding principle of the modern profession when she said: \"Let whoever is in charge keep this simple question in her head, not 'How can I always do this right thing myself?' but 'How can I provide for this right thing to be always done?'\" </p> <p>Mr Reid said one of the rea sons for the growth in MRSA was a decision by the last Conservative government to contract out cleaning work, putting cheapness before cleanliness. The people doing the cleaning did not always feel part of the healthcare team. </p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I am not going to ban contracting out at the moment ... but if there is going to be a contract out-of-house, then the nursing staff must be involved in the drawing up of that contract so that there is clear control for clinical nursing staff on the ground.\" </p> <p>However, he acknowledged that hospital-acquired infections have affected 9% of patients for 50 years. The difference now was the danger posed by the MRSA superbug. </p> <p>According to official estimates, about 100,000 patients in England are affected by hospital-acquired infections each year, resulting in around 5,000 deaths. But last week the MRSA Support Group said the number of deaths was four times higher. </p> <p>The charter includes 10 pri orities for keeping hospitals clean. It said a patient's environment should be well-maintained, clean and safe, and cleaning staff should be made to feel part of the ward team. </p> <p>The charter was welcomed by nursing and midwifery unions. But the shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, said: \"Over the last seven years, rates of MRSA have doubled; 40% of the staphylococcus aureus bacteria in the UK is resistant to methicillin. This compares to 1% in the Netherlands. </p> <p>\"Four years ago, the National Audit Office highlighted the extent of the problems. Since then, the urgency with which this issue should have been addressed has been lacking.\" </p> <p>In a move that baffled officials at the Department of Health, Labour chose the day of the MRSA initiative to launch a pre-emptive election campaign strike against the \"Victor Meldrew\" strategy of the Conservatives to argue that Britain was getting worse, not better. </p> <p>Alan Milburn, a former health secretary, said: \"We will take on the politics of pessimism by winning back hope and confidence in Britain.\" Mr Milburn and his successor, John Reid, used improving outcomes in the NHS - from better cancer and heart attack survival rates to faster operations in brand new hospitals - to back their argument. </p> <p>But the message was complicated by claims from the Office for National Statistics that NHS productivity is still falling, despite the extra billions being spent.</p>",
  "<p>It's a sunny October afternoon, and a group of regulars in the Millers Arms pub in Lincoln are engaged in an animated discussion about whether Gina Mallard should be jailed for breaching an antisocial behaviour order (Asbo). Mallard, a colourful, loud-mouthed 41-year-old mother of two, is notorious in the high street area for her outrageous drunken behaviour. And, until recently, no one seemed to know what to do about her. </p> <p>Everyone, it seems, has at least one outlandish yarn to relay. Mallard's exploits have become the stuff of folklore. Tales are told of how she is regularly spotted staggering drunk down the street, beer can in hand, swearing at passersby. Shopkeepers roll their eyes as they recall her prancing about in her underwear in public, or with her knickers on over her jeans. </p> <p>Others mention the time Mallard lobbed a brick through an off licence window after staff refused to serve her. The owner of the local newsagent lets loose a resigned chuckle. Grown men, she says, have been known to run into her shop to hide in fear of Mallard making a pass at them. \"She's a big, strong woman, and forceful when she's drunk,\" another shopowner says. \"She might not actually hit you, but there's always a worry that one day she will thump someone. I've seen her smashing up a phone box for no reason.\" </p> <p>The landlady of the Millers Arms talks of the last time she had to call the police to \"sort Gina out\". She had been \"off her face\", bothering punters and finishing their drinks when they weren't looking. The police eventually arrested her. \"Jail wouldn't be enough for her,\" declares one man in the pub as he peers over a pint of bitter. \"She's frightening and she scares the kids at the school across the road,\" says another drinker. </p> <p>\"I feel sorry for her,\" a young woman standing by the bar says with a stern shake of her head. \"She has problems. Yes, she gets drunk and shouts and is a nuisance. But shouldn't she be getting help for her drinking problems instead of being thrown into prison? What good will that do? She'll only be let out and start doing it all over again.\" </p> <p>The \"Mallard question\", it is fair to say, has divided the community. Some local people regard her merely as an irritant or public nuisance. Others believe she is an aggressive, violent terror whose antics make their lives a misery. Mallard's stepfather, Malcolm Pell, with whom she shares a house just off the high street, attempted to explain her behaviour in the local paper: \"When she drinks, her anger and depression seem to come out.\" </p> <p>Mallard was issued with an Asbo in July last year following dozens of court appearances for petty crime, including criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly. The conditions of the Asbo stipulate that she cannot drink or be drunk in a public place for two years. </p> <p>But Mallard has breached the Asbo seven times. As a result, when she appears at Lincoln crown court for sentencing next Monday she could face five years in jail - the maximum penalty for a breach. She has been on remand for 14 weeks. </p> <p>Earlier this month, the Lincolnshire Echo ran a front page article questioning the logic of jailing Mallard for breaching the Asbo (to date, most local press coverage around the country has been in favour of Asbos). The article provoked a deluge of letters to the editor, some protesting at the harshness of Mallard's treatment, others - including a nurse who treated her at Lincoln county hospital - saying she deserves all she gets. \"On several occasions she completely destroyed her room, throwing a television across the room and requiring hospital security to calm the situation,\" wrote the nurse. Lincolnshire police says it applied for the Asbo to help its officers protect the local community from what it describes as Mallard's \"horrendous\" behaviour. \"She is not a loveable rogue, people are quite frightened and intimidated by her,\" says a police spokesman. </p> <p>With her persistent disruptive behaviour, and its obvious detrimental effect on the local community, Mallard is, in theory, exactly the sort of person the government had in mind when it introduced Asbos five years ago. The government defines grounds for Asbos as: \"a manner that caused, or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household\". </p> <p>Asbos were introduced to act as a deterrent and to help rid local communities of troublemakers. They can be served on anyone 10-years-old or over. According to the most recent Home Office figures, 2,455 Asbos have been issued since 1999. They have been lauded by the home secretary, David Blunkett, and held up time and again by ministers as evidence of New Labour's \"tough on crime\" credentials. </p> <p>So far, the public and the media have tended to focus on Asbos dished out to young people. But Mallard's case - and a spate of orders against vulnerable groups such as beggars - has begun to fuel concern that Asbos are beginning to be applied inappropriately. The conditions imposed by some recent Asbos have attracted ridicule. There is the case where someone has been banned from being sarcastic (he challenged it saying he was being ironic). In another case, a boy has been banned from using the word \"grass\" in England until 2010. In each case, in theory, a breach could lead to a five-year jail term. On the face of it, Mallard's Asbo does not appear flagrantly ridiculous, but nor does it seem entirely rational. </p> <p>Critics allege that by imposing conditions like these, Asbos are setting people up to fail - especially vulnerable individuals - who, they say, need rehabilitation, not time inside. A spokeswoman for drugs and alcohol charity Addaction says she is bewildered by the government's belief that instructing someone with a alcohol problem not to drink will be effective, and calls it \"pointless\". She adds: \"The problem is bigger than the person. I can see how Asbos might be effective in some circumstances, but there needs to be more appropriate help for people with drink-related problems.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Alcohol Concern adds that there are worries about whether Asbos can ever be a long-term answer to \"street drunks\". There is no quick fix, she says, and more thought needs to go into how health services, local councils, police and the courts work together. </p> <p>The charities concede that for some individuals - perhaps those who continually refuse treatment - jail is inevitable. But they insist that, once in prison, people with alcohol problems are let down by the system. They point to a Prison Reform Trust report in January that concluded that only one prison of 138 in England and Wales has a recognised alcohol abuse programme. </p> <p>Civil liberties group Liberty says there are broader implications. Asbos are in danger of being used as a \"back door\" method of locking people up for minor offences because of the kinds of conditions applied, a spokesman says. Asbos come under civil law and are issued for offences that probably would not lead to a custodial sentence. However, as Liberty points out, breaches are a criminal offence. And, since some are for minor things (such as drinking in a pub), which would not themselves qualify for jail sentence in the criminal courts, the person being jailed need not have committed any serious crime. </p> <p>\"There simply is not enough monitoring of Asbos and their effectiveness,\" the Liberty spokesman says. \"There have now been thousands of Asbos issued. It allows politicians to sound tough, but do we really know how effective they are? We are not against Asbos, but there is an argument for a full-scale review of the policy.\" </p> <p>Rob Allen, director of campaign group Rethinking Crime and Punishment, says handing out custodial sentences for Asbo breaches appears to run \"counter to the overall thrust of government policy, which is to cut prison numbers\". </p> <p>In a statement, a Home Office spokesman points to the fact that two-thirds of Asbos are not breached as \"a clear indication of their effectiveness\", and this is backed up, he says, by research that shows communities \"felt safer\". Labour's alcohol crime reduction strategy, announced earlier this year, is also being promoted as evidence of a fresh focus on vulnerable people with alcohol-related problems. </p> <p> The government is keen to get across that it has a \"tiered approach\" to antisocial behaviour. It says \"appropriate interventions\" by agencies and social services are made where necessary. Whether ministers will listen in the coming months to the growing number of voices challenging this remains to be seen. </p> <p>There are no plans to set guidelines for the conditions laid down by Asbos, the Home Office insists. They will continue to be left to the courts' discretion. Some 35% of Asbos are breached one or more times, and 18% of all Asbos handed out result in a custodial sentence. There are no figures available from government on the length of sentences. If Mallard is given the maximum sentence next week, more people may start to question the government's line. </p> <p>Back at the pub, people mull over the arguments. Life is quieter with Mallard on remand, they say. But one customer sums up a reservation shared by the group. \"What good is jail going to do in the end? Don't people just come out having learned other stuff about committing crime?\" </p> <p><strong>The A-Z of Asbos</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Total number of Asbos issued in England and Wales between April 1, 1999 and March 31, 2004: 2,455. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Number of applications for Asbos turned down by the courts: 42 (1.7%). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Total issued against 10- to17-year-olds: 1,169. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Total issued to adults 18 and over: 1,286. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Highest number of Asbos issued by a single region: 422 by Greater Manchester. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>15.2% of Asbos are issued to women. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>If the number of Asbos given out in the first quarter of 2004 is matched in subsequent quarters, the total will be almost double that of 2003. </p> <p>The following are from the most up-to- date breakdown of figures available from government (June 1, 2000, to December 31, 2002): </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 50% of breaches result in a custodial sentence (18% of all Asbos end in a jail term).* </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 35.5% of all Asbos are breached one or more times.** </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Source: Home Office figures for England and Wales collected from courts. * The government could not supply figures for average length of sentences, number of jail terms served, or the maximum jail term served to date. ** The government counts multiple breaches as a single breach.

  "Senior MPs have bowed to the inevitable and agreed to appoint a single parliamentary security coordinator to strengthen protective measures in and around the Palace of Westminster during the current resurgence of terrorist threats and political protest. <p>This means that pressure from the security services and the Metropolitan police will soon see the Commons sergeant at arms and Black Rod, his counterpart in the Lords - both usually senior ex-military \"men in tights\" - ceding their security powers and budget to a professional. </p> <p>In effect, that means control going to the police and MI5 who bear the burden of protecting the chief symbol of British democracy and their elected representatives from terrorists - once the IRA, now Islamist extremists - as well as from hunt protesters, and, last spring, militant fathers. </p> <p>The concession was announced last night in a written parliamentary answer after members of the House of Commons Commission, which supervises management of the Victorian legislature, abandoned their deeply held principle that Lords and Commons always operate on parallel, but separate and equal, terms. </p> <p>The joint security committee, chaired by deputy chief whip, Bob Ainsworth, initially rejected the new solution, then changed its mind. </p> <p>The commission this week endorsed that change, which was confirmed by Sir Archy Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat MP, last night. </p> <p>Sir Archy said: \"Some recent enhancements of security arrangements have already been announced to members.

  "Nanny is back. I don't mean that more people are employed in domestic service in the UK at the beginning of the 21st century than they were at the end of the 19th, which they are. Nor that Mary Poppins will soon be descending on the capital once more, this time in a West End musical, which she is. I mean the protests that we are becoming a nanny state are becoming more numerous by the day. <p>Nanny alerts are all over the place. Alan Milburn set one off by suggesting we should penalise those who fail to attend parenting, childcare or literacy programmes. God helps those who help themselves, but it is down to us to smite those who refuse to do so. </p> <p>The government is considering giving local authorities the power to ban smoking in public places. And although it doesn't seem to know what to do about the \"obesity epidemic\", other than give free fruit and vegetables to school children, it wants to do something. </p> <p>So terrifying is nanny that the brewing industry is voluntarily getting its house in order. The Yates chain now frowns on happy hours, while both Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Coors breweries are introducing responsible drinking warnings on their cans and bottles. </p> <p>Asda has even banned the sale of eggs to children in the run-up to Halloween, to stop the little dears using them as missiles. The litany of complaints could go on. They are all, however, thoroughly misguided. Sack nanny if you want, but someone has got to do her job. </p> <p>The problem with critics of the nanny state is that they mistakenly equate non-interference by government with freedom. They can't see beyond the surface of John Stuart Mill's maxim that the, \"only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant.\" </p> <p>Too true. But who is harming who is precisely what is at issue. For instance, as an exhaustive study published this week shows, smoking in enclosed public spaces does harm others, in particular the people who work in bars and restaurants. The way in which the big breweries have been heavily discounting alcohol and encouraging bingeing through promotions and offers harms the health of the nation. Food manufacturers who put too much salt in their products contribute to heart disease. Welfare claimants who do nothing to improve their situation, even when help is offered, waste all our money. And, yes, if you sell eggs to a gang of kids who are evidently not going home to bake a cake, you are aiding and abetting their albeit minor misdemeanours. </p> <p>It is odd that those who instinctively feel uncomfortable with measures to mitigate these harms are often those who complain that large corporations have too much power. They queue to see Super Size Me and lament the insidious effects of McDonald's, but when the someone proposes doing something about it, their anti-corporate zeal vanishes. Perhaps they are persuaded that since no one is forcing you to eat, drink or smoke too much, individuals should be left to exercise their free will. </p> <p>This revered faculty seems to be considered inviolable, indivisible and pure. Any suggestion that it is not all it is cracked up to be is said to threaten the morality and dignity of the human race. Without free will we are no more than animals or robots. </p> <p>The obvious rejoinder is that we may actually be no more than animals or robots and that, if we are, getting upset about the fact isn't going to change the situation. </p> <p>Less facetiously, we should accept that freedom is not all or nothing. Our power to exercise our free will is limited and conditioned by the environment in which we find ourselves. Someone in the grip of an addiction has lost a considerable amount of their free will. We should accept that our power to choose freely is more subtly affected by the pressures society puts on us. We can only choose what is on offer, and we are all too susceptible to persuasion by people who conceal their own vested interests and don't have our best ones at heart. </p> <p>To maximise our freedom, therefore, we should be interested in creating a society in which we have the maximum power to make choices for ourselves. That may require us to limit the extent to which influences that are corrosive to freedom are allowed to operate. </p> <p>This is where the language of paternalism and the nanny state misleads us. It reflects an old-fashioned, deferential view of political power in which there is a great divide between the governed and the government. Rather, the government is ours, and we do not ask it to act like a parent to us, but to protect our interests in the ways wedemand. If they let us down, it is for us to chastise them, not vice versa. </p> <p>Of course, governments can go too far. Mill was right that no actions that harm only ourselves should be illegal. But there is a difference between regulation and banning outright. That is why there is no mixed message in calling for a lift on absolute prohibitions on illegal drugs, while at the same time legislating to encourage responsible drinking and coming down hard on those whose intoxication risks harm to others. Nor is the proposed increase in the number and size of casinos necessarily a bad thing, if it is matched by much stricter regulation of gambling, as promised. </p> <p>The Brits love to mock George W Bush's simplistic appeals to the virtues of freedom, but the truth is our notions of liberty are scarcely more sophisticated. In order to be truly free, both personally and politically, we need to mandate our freely elected representatives to control what companies and individuals can and cannot do. This is not hiring a nanny, it is looking after ourselves. </p> <p> <b> Britney's big break will do her good</b></p> <p>Britney Spears is to take a career break because she believes she has been naive and overexposed. Such a brutal, honest and frankly true self-assessment is remarkable but not unprecedented. Spears is, probably unwittingly, following in the footsteps of Estelle Morris, who resigned as education secretary because she didn't feel she was effective enough. </p> <p>Such candour is still the exception rather than the rule. After all, I don't recall Michael Winner refusing to shoot the Death Wish sequels because they frankly weren't ever going to be very good. Nor do I expect Prince Charles to announce that he is too flaky ever to become an effective king. As for the Pope admitting his fallibility, dream on. </p> <p>Some are of the view that it is good not to dwell on your imperfections. To be our best, we need to think ourselves the best. I am not convinced. I think we only become better by being honest about our own limitations, and then striving to overcome them. That's why I predict Britney's big break will do her good in the long run. Just don't expect me to quit if I'm wrong. Which I won't be, of course. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Julian Baggini is the author of What's It All About? Philosophy and the Meaning of Life, Granta Books.</p>",
  "Amid many rumours of \"Moscow gold\" being used during the 1926 general strike, the government made a concerted attempt to freeze any funds being transferred to trade unions from the rest of Europe. <p>More than \u00a31.4m is believed to have flowed into British banks in 1926, with \u00a3400,000 coming from the Soviet Union through the Co-operative Wholesale Society to the Miners' Federation. </p> <p>The Home Office file released today shows that under emergency powers legislation, the banks, including the Moscow Narodny, were compelled to inform the home secretary about any doubtful transactions. </p> <p>Civil servants were convinced that \"arrangements were being made for payments to the TUC by bodies outside England of large sums of money for the purpose of furthering the strike\". </p> <p>One secret report to Captain Miller of MI5 from the Westminster Bank confirmed that three senior executives from the Co-op had turned up five days before the start of the general strike and collected \u00a3300,000. </p> <p>But the Home Office investigation failed to establish the truth of allegations made by the Daily Mail that the money paid to the Co-op was a direct subvention from Russia in support of the general strike. </p> <p>The Co-op bank maintained that the money had come from \"purely commercial sources\".

  "The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, last night stamped firmly on suggestions floated by the home secretary that the criminal standard of proof might be lowered for terrorist prosecutions. <p>Mr Macdonald said the rule that criminal charges had to be proved to the higher standard of \"beyond reasonable doubt\" and not to the lower civil standard - on the balance of probabilities - was \"not negotiable\". Last February, David Blunkett raised the possibility of a lower standard of proof for terror cases, but dropped the idea in the face of criticism from senior legal figures, including the DPP.</p> <p>Mr Macdonald insisted last night that the criminal standard would remain for all prosecutions, along with a raft of other rights guaranteed by article 6 of the European convention on human rights, the right to a fair trial. When embarking on criminal justice reform, he said, it was right to spell out what was not negotiable, and what was \"baggage\" which could be jettisoned.</p> <p>\"So let us be clear: fair trial, routinely open, before an independent and impartial tribunal is not negotiable. Equality of arms, fairness between prosecution and defence, is not negotiable,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The right to full disclosure of the case against you is not negotiable. And the criminal standard of proof is not negotiable. It seems to me appropriate that the director of public prosecutions should say all this plainly and clearly.\"</p> <p>Mr Macdonald was giving the Tom Sargant memorial lecture in London, organised by the law reform organisation Justice in honour of the late campaigner against wrongful convictions.</p> <p>The DPP said miscarriages of justice had occurred because the original model for the Crown Prosecution Service required police and prosecutors to work separately. In every other country that guaranteed a fair trial, prosecutors and investigators worked together.</p> <p>\"Our failure to follow this model has compromised investigations and prosecutions. I am sure it has also resulted in miscarriages of justice. It has been bad for victims, for witnesses, for defendants and for the public.\"</p> <p>This would change under plans to involve prosecutors in advising on investigations and charges. But more needed to change, including the longstanding rule that prosecutors could not talk to witnesses before the trial.</p>",
  "The European commission will today strike a blow for cross-Channel shoppers by taking the government to Europe's highest court over seizures by customs officials of \"excessive\" imports of wine, spirits and tobacco on so-called booze cruises. <p>The commission will ignore a last-minute compromise by Treasury ministers to end a three-year dispute over the impounding of cheaper, duty-paid cigarettes and wine bought at French and Belgian hypermarkets - and even of shoppers' cars. </p> <p>The row over \"disproportionate penalties\" has seen the outgoing British commissioners, Neil Kinnock and Chris Patten, side with the government in lobbying their colleagues to withhold support for the legal action sought by Frits Bolkestein, the internal market commissioner. </p> <p>But in what is being seen in Whitehall as \"Bolkestein's last stand\" before he leaves next week after bruising battles with the chancellor, Gordon Brown, over this and other issues, the commission will take the UK to the European court of justice in Luxembourg. </p> <p>Last week it enraged Germany by taking it to court over the \"VW law\" protecting Volkswagen from hostile takeover. </p> <p>The row hinges on the treatment of Britons who exceed \"indicative\" guidelines by bringing home more than the 800 cigarettes, 90 litres of wine and 110 litres of beer and \"selling\" them on to family and friends on a not-for-profit basis. Customs believes the imported goods, often bought at half UK prices, are sold on the black market. </p> <p>The economic secretary, John Healey, last week wrote to Mr Bolkestein saying that customs officials would submit compromise proposals \"within the next two weeks\" - too late for the outgoing commissioner to act. </p> <p>British sources said the government, which has a long-running campaign against smuggling and its multi-billion drain on Treasury coffers, had given a verbal assurance that Customs would no longer seize the cars of first-time offenders and would henceforth allow people to keep the goods on payment of duty owed and a proportion of the fine. </p> <p>A commission official said it was \"purely a tactical manoeuvre by the Brits, who are playing for time\".</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps only a social worker could mourn the passing of a maroon Citroen 2CV. \"I called it Claud and I loved it,\" says Rachel Culley. \"One day it just died. Unfortunately, you can't get them any more. I now lease something sensible, like a Rover. When I had the 2CV, I used to wear flowing ethnic clothes. The kids thought it was hilarious.\" So did Claud have a CND sticker on his/its back window? \"No, but there was one urging people in the car behind to Foster For Coventry,\" says Culley, 49, who is part of the city's permanency team, working with children for whom the plan is adoption. </p> <p>\"The thing about two-door cars like that,\" grins her colleague, Jim McDaid, \"is that they make it more difficult for kids to jump out.\" McDaid, 52, works in the mental health team in a deprived sector of the city - today he's wearing a faded denim jacket over a green polo shirt: \"I've got a couple of duffel coats as well. In the summer I sometimes wear sandals. No socks, mind you.\" </p> <p>Needless to say, there is a certain amount of self-parody going on among this group of vastly experienced workers gathered at a table in Coventry's social services department. They're aware their profession is portrayed by such luminaries as the Daily Mail's Keith Waterhouse as full of people with woolly hats pulled over heads full of woolly ideas. Also that established soap operas like EastEnders perpetuate the stereotype of social workers as politically correct busybodies. </p> <p>The good-humoured response among these foot soldiers in the battle to ease the pressures on damaged and deprived people belies the earnestness that comes with that stereotype.Yet there is some underlying concern that negative images undermine their work. A recent survey of 1,000 people across England found that more than half understood little or nothing about what social work involves. Which hardly surprises Kath Evans, 56, a member of Coventry's children's disability team. \"We are invisible until something awful happens,\" she says. </p> <p>\"Attitudes are based on what the public read. Sometimes you have to get over a barrier of perception before you can help. Clients can be very anxious about what we're up to because their image of us is based on the press we get. We need something to counter that, because we do a lot of good work and I do feel that the difficult decisions we make, and the responsibilities we feel, are not recognised. Maybe there should be a series of television adverts, like the ones for the police where the viewer was asked: 'Could you do this job?'\" </p> <p>And maybe, I tentatively suggest to McDaid, some social workers might get more respect if they turned out in smarter, more professional-looking clothes. He shrugs: \"If I put on a suit in the area where I work, they'd think I was a policeman. So I dress down.\" Like the drugs squad? \"Yes, except that the drugs squad look as though they've just come off the dance floor. Actually, there's a young chap I work with who dresses smartly in the modern idiom. I wouldn't feel comfortable with that.\" </p> <p>In some professions, younger practitioners are pushing for an ever-more-casual approach to dress at work. In social work, it is the other way around. \"Certainly the hippy image was more prevalent in the early 1970s when I started,\" recalls John Bolton, Coventry's director of social services, whose office is just down the corridor. </p> <p>Paradoxically, he feels the profession had more respect from the public in those days: \"Mind you, there were exceptions. My first job as a young social worker was to approach a woman in a mining village who was looking after a friend's children. I had to register her as a carer, but I was a bit taken aback when she opened the door and said: 'What the eff do you want? It's none of your effing business.' After a while, she said: 'I suppose you want an effing cup of tea'. She then put a teabag in a pot and ran some water over it, straight out of the hot tap. I felt obliged to drink it.\" </p> <p>Exceptions apart, how did perceptions change so much that polls now put the public esteem of social workers not only below that of nurses and police officers, but also that of teachers? </p> <p>From Maria Colwell, in 1973, to Victoria Climbi\u00e9 and beyond, over 30 years of irregular yet horrific child-abuse cases have taken their toll. The media have lashed around for somebody or some body to carry the can. Directors of social services have sweated under TV lights, blinking at flashbulbs as they explain how staff missed clues which now seem obvious. </p> <p>\"Social workers are mostly portrayed in the media for their failings,\" says Bolton. \"Yet every day they're making a really big difference to people's lives. The vast majority of the public, however, don't come into contact with social services unless their parents need help or they have a serious accident. And even then it doesn't necessarily follow. </p> <p>\"The other day, I came across a wheelchair user who was managing perfectly well with the help of her husband and a neighbour. When the husband ran off with the neighbour, who was there to pick up the pieces? She was effusive about the way my staff had rallied round to help her.\" </p> <p>It sounds like a soap-opera storyline. Wouldn't a soap give the public a more rounded view of what social workers do? \"I'm not sure,\" says Bolton. \"There are more than enough TV series about the police, but the images are negative as well as positive.\" </p> <p>Round the corner from Bolton's office, at Coventry University, third-year social work student Denise Marshall, 36, has had the sort of life that could transfer to the small screen. In her late teens and early 20s, she worked as a \"blagger\" on nightclub doors in Benidorm. \"It was my job to talk people into the club. I've always been a good talker - and listener - but, in the course of that job I was assaulted and thrown over a table. A great learning experience for being a social worker, don't you think?\" she asks, eyes twinkling. </p> <p>Despite her background as a seeker of sun and fun, Marshall hasn't been put off by social work's less-than-glamorous image. Nor have colleagues on the three-year BA course which is now the standard qualification for the profession. \"In my community [Pakistani] it's a very highly esteemed job,\" says Ansar Alam, 32. For a Muslim, it seems, \"do-gooder\" is not a term of derision. \"If you look into our religion, it's about trying to help people. In fact, the only member of my family who didn't want me to do this was my husband. But, because he loves me, he agreed to support me. I've shared a lot of the work with him, and he's so impressed that he's considering doing this course himself.\" </p> <p>Among those graduating at the end of this year will be Nansi Ellis, 39, who decided to train as a social worker after years as a personnel officer at Land Rover: \"In a big company, it's all about chasing the next salary cheque. I remember feeling particularly disillusioned by the company's so-called 'diversity training' on issues of race and disability. It was just a cynical exercise in getting boxes ticked so that you could move up the career ladder. Out of 40 people on the session I attended, there were three women and nobody with a disability. The vast majority were able-bodied white guys in their 30s. All in sharp suits.\" </p> <p>Not a denim jacket or a duffel coat between them. </p> <p><strong>The own goal of no comment</strong></p> <p>Social workers complain about being sterotyped by the media, but do they, in turn, stereotype the media as being universally against them? </p> <p>Freelance journalist Allister Craddock, until recently a producer of documentaries for Carlton Television, has seen enough of the terrain in which social workers operate to empathise with the difficulties they face. </p> <p>\"The cases they have to deal with involve extreme deprivation and anger,\" he says. \"Somehow they have to steer a path through that. It's the kind of job that most people wouldn't want to do for half an hour.\" But Craddock also feels that social services departments do themselves no favours when it comes to dealing with media queries. \"There's a feeling that they'd be betraying a client's interest by saying anything whatsoever,\" he says. \"That becomes a cast-iron, unbreakable commitment. </p> <p>\"It can be frustrating for a journalist because you know you may be getting only a part of a complicated story. Allegations are made and all we get back from local authority press offices is 'no comment'.\"</p>",
  "<p>They will be among the most powerful managers in public services in England, potentially responsible for around two-thirds of local authority budgets. And these newly created children's services directors will be on salaries of up to \u00a3130,000 - their reward for the daunting task of bringing together two quite different, and often conflicting, cultures: that of education and that of children's social services. </p> <p>When the government's child welfare reform programme, Every Child Matters, was unveiled last year, some in social services predicted it would lead to an education takeover of children's services. They were concerned that children's social services would be swallowed up by much larger education departments. </p> <p>These fears appear to have been confirmed by the fact that all but a handful of the 27 children's directors appointed so far have come from education. </p> <p>One of the few to buck this trend is Trevor Doughty. Currently director of social services at South Tyneside metropolitan borough council, he will next month become director of children's services at Northumberland county council. Doughty, 48, will oversee the establishment of a families and children's trust. This will not only amalgamate education and social services but also second staff from health, the youth advice service Connexions and youth offending teams. </p> <p>For Doughty the \u00a397,000 post is a natural progression. He previously worked at Northumberland as assistant director of both adult and children's services before joining South Tyneside in 1999. As assistant children's director he helped to set up integrated teams of social workers, health visitors, school nurses and education welfare officers. </p> <p>\"People got much better access to children's services,\" says Doughty. \"The links with schools were much better. And users got more thorough and sensitive interventions.\" </p> <p>More recently, at South Tyneside council, he has helped set up one of the first 35 \"pathfinder\" children's trusts, which are pioneering the integration of local children's services. \"I've always been an integrationist by instinct,\" he says. \"So I'm attracted to having all children's services in one directorate.\" </p> <p>Doughty is not discouraged that most children's services director posts so far have gone to education directors. \"It's early days yet,\" he says. \"A lot of the other children's director posts filled so far were filled internally. If an authority is restructuring it's more likely that the director of social services will take over adult services because they have experience of both adult and children's services, rather than there being any open prejudice against social services directors.\" </p> <p>Indeed, where the post has been advertised, social services directors have been appointed. Most recently, Lisa Christensen, Norfolk social services director, was appointed as the county council's children's director - on a salary of \u00a3120,000. </p> <p>Part of the reason why education directors were initially predicted to take the children's director posts was because education funding would take up the lion's share of the combined children's services budget. But Doughty believes that social services directors have more experience of dealing with complex funding arrangements, including pooled budgets, owing to partnerships with the NHS to commission and provide adult care. </p> <p>\"Northumberland's children's services budget is \u00a3200m, while my social services budget at South Tyneside is \u00a350m,\" says Doughty. \"But it's a mid-size department. Other social services directors are handling much larger budgets. If you look at education budgets, the bulk - 75% in Northumberland - goes directly to schools, while social services directors have experience of controlling large and complex funds.\" </p> <p>The deadline for appointing children's directors is 2008. Research by the Improvement and Development Agency for local government suggests that many local authorities are waiting until after they have integrated their education and social services departments. </p> <p>\"Pulling the different professional cultures together will be a challenge,\" says Doughty. But as Northumberland was the first local authority to establish a care trust to amalgamate all adult services, he believes there is a strong base on which to build integrated children's services. </p> <p>Doughty will have a lead officer for schools and learning and a lead officer for children and families' services working under him - they will take day-to-day managerial responsibility for those areas. He sees his role as strategic management. </p> <p>\"I don't think directors of children's services will have day-to-day contact with head teachers,\" he says. \"That doesn't mean the role will be entirely hands off. If you pick up on the Victoria Climbi\u00e9 inquiry report you'd need to know if there's any problem in child protection or services for looked-after children.\" </p> <p>Andrew Cozens, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, believes there is no \"perfect\" children's director. \"It's an enormous role, huge in scope; politically it's going to be a challenge to manage,\" he says. \"A children's director will need to be able to quickly form a judgment about a children's home (as an experienced director of social services can) or a school (like an experienced education director). But I think that the accountability social services directors have - being rung up at the weekend about child protection cases - will be a shock to those from an education background.\" </p> <p>Cozens suggests that education directors have won most of the children's director posts because the school achievement agenda is a greater political priority than the social inclusion agenda of social services. </p> <p>\"What tends to worry local authorities is the significance of education and directors' relationships with head teachers,\" he says. \"The concern is, would someone without an education background have credibility with head teachers?\" </p> <p>He predicts that the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) will judge children's trusts on their success in improving school standards. \"It will be a plate-spinning exercise for children's directors. If you have weak schools you'll come under great pressure from the DfES.\" </p> <p>One of Doughty's first tasks will be overseeing a restructuring of the county's schools system. Following a review, the local authority decided to abolish middle schools and adopt a two-tier structure of primary and secondary schools favoured by most councils. </p> <p>Doughty has no doubt that he is up to the task, but admits that it will be a challenge to bring schools on board with the current child-welfare reforms. \"It's not helpful to talk about social inclusion and educational attainment as though they're separate,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Northumberland's children's trust will cover all children. We'll be as concerned with how many 16-18-year-olds get A to C grades at GCSE and with the 40% who don't. And we will also be concerned with the most vulnerable, at risk and in need. But there seems to be a contradiction between the government's five-year education plan and the children bill. You can't require schools to be part of children's trusts. It's one of the first things I've got to address, persuading schools to be partners in the trust.\" </p> <p>Schools will need to see that there are clear benefits to participating in children's trusts, says Doughty. </p> <p>\"Schools' criticism of social services is that they're often only interested in the most vulnerable, but schools want help with the broader swathes of children who need less intensive support. Social services need to realise that head-teachers are approaching welfare from the perspective of 'what can we do to eradicate problems that get in the way of learning'.\" </p> <p>He suggests that extended schools, which provide a range of additional support and care services such as childcare or breakfast clubs, will provide solutions to those problems. </p> <p>Does Doughty have any concerns about the amalgamation of children's services? </p> <p>\"There's a danger of social work values being diluted or undermined as a result of integration,\" he says. \"I'm a champion of social work values. They've played an important part in child welfare in the last 30 years and need to continue to do so. I'm in favour of integrated teams but the social worker has a very important role to play in those teams.\" </p> <p>What concerns Cozens, though, is whether social services managers in children's trusts will gain the skills and experience to step up into the children's director role in the future. \"A large number of social services and education directors are nearing retirement age,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Many assistant directors have a very strong focus on the particular functions they manage, but lack generic management experience -which may be less available in a more specialised organisation. It will be a big leap up for them to become children's services director. A lot of work is going to be needed to develop their leadership potential.\"</p>",
  "<p>Karen and Barry meet in a nightclub and embark on a brief sexual relationship. Barry is clear that he does not want children. Karen emphatically does, and is equally certain that she can bring them up alone. She inseminates herself from Barry's discarded condom and ends the relationship before her pregnancy begins to show. </p> <p>She gives birth to a beautiful child, Lola, with no intention of informing Barry. Problems arise, however, when Karen gives up work. She is told that her benefits can be withheld unless she provides the name of Lola's father. Barry's name is passed on to the Child Support Agency (CSA), which demands \u00a3320 a month towards Lola's upkeep. While the CSA officer who interviews Barry is sympathetic, he explains that the law is crystal clear: Barry has an obligation to support his child, regardless of the circumstances of conception. </p> <p>Take another case. A man (let's call him Simon) attends a party. After drinking for several hours, he collapses drunk in a bedroom. When he wakes up, wearing only his unbuttoned shirt, he discovers that a woman had sex with him while he was unconscious. A US court confirms Simon's duty to pay child support, emphasising that any wrongful conduct on the part of the mother cannot alter the genetic father's duty to provide for his child. </p> <p>The first of these scenarios forms the basis for a drama, Whose Baby?, to be broadcast on ITV1 on Monday. The second really happened. Both cases throw into vivid relief the importance placed on genetics in grounding our perceived responsibilities towards children. </p> <p>The imminent removal of sperm and egg donor anonymity suggests that the significance we attach to genetic links is growing. But many will find themselves troubled by the idea that Barry and Simon are liable for the financial upkeep of \"their\" children. Of course, it might be argued that they ran the risk of pregnancy, and therefore should help to shoulder resulting costs. However, while Barry consented to sex, he did not consent to creating a child. </p> <p>And it seems unfair to accuse either Barry or Simon of reckless indifference to the risk of conception. Is Simon really accepting the possibility of sexual assault resulting in pregnancy by getting drunk at a party - and would we tolerate this kind of argument made regarding a woman? Is Barry risk-taking by not flushing away used condoms himself? And do we really believe that, in consenting to sex, men must also consent to the risk of procreation? Rejection of precisely this argument (as applied to women) underpinned long and very bitter campaigns to legalise abortion. </p> <p>The logic of our child support legislation is grounded in the genetic link: men are financially liable to support their genetic children. The debates that preceded the introduction of the Child Support Act 1991 relied heavily on images of feckless fathers, more interested in sex than responsibilities towards children, and promiscuous single mothers whose excessive fertility was draining the Treasury. The solution seemed obvious: to reassert the nuclear family, imposing financial responsibility for women and children where it has always truly belonged - with men. And where the family was without a male breadwinner, the obvious choice of financial provider was the genetic father. </p> <p>But, given a marked demographic trend away from lifelong heterosexual cohabitation, is this reassertion of the nuclear family tenable? If the ongoing two-parent family is no longer the preferred living arrangement for most people, can its ghost really provide the basis for determining rights and responsibilities with regard to children? And how can this model possibly purport to achieve fair solutions for gay and lesbian families, or \"families of choice\" where groups of adults who have never been sexually intimate set up house and raise children together? </p> <p>Questioning the financial responsibility of men like Barry and Simon raises serious difficulties. Women are disproportionately affected (in financial and other ways) by childcare responsibilities, and this plays a significant role in explaining gendered disparities in wealth. Removing men's automatic liability to pay child support might seem to risk exacerbating this inequity. But our current child support legislation is not playing any useful role in solving the problem of female poverty. The CSA operates, in large part, to transfer resources from fathers to the Treasury, not from fathers to mothers. Primary carers' benefits are cut in line with non-resident parents' payments. </p> <p>The hysteria preceding the establishment of the CSA focused heavily on the financial costs of raising children. But elsewhere we see children not just as costs but also as the future wealth and continuation of society. The newborn babies of today are the plumbers, nurses and refuse collectors of tomorrow. If parents derive a benefit from children, so too will society as a whole. </p> <p>This is true if we accept either a general societal interest in the continuation of the species, or our own individual interests as the dependent elderly of the future who will need a younger generation to care for us. Why then do we not accept childcare as an important contribution towards societal good and seek to support it, and those who perform it, through our taxes? </p> <p>Our child support legislation not only perpetuates women's dependency on men but also obscures the need for a proper debate about social responsibility for funding childcare. If the government is serious in its \"historic aim\" to end child poverty within a generation, then the only realistic way to achieve this is through a serious reappraisal of the current basis for financing childcare, with a far greater emphasis on collective responsibility. </p> <p>When a privatised model of child support liability is combined with a clearly gendered structure of primary responsibility for children, then it is no surprise when female poverty results. And, given that the economic situation of children is largely dependent on the means of their resident parent(s), a primarily privatised support system also underpins the continuing poverty of children. In a country where the wealth to rectify this situation exists, this is cause for national shame. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sally Sheldon, a professor of law at Keele University, is researching a book on fatherhood (co-authored with Richard Collier) to be published by Hart Publications.

  "<p>This a significant month in my professional and personal life. Forty years ago, on a bleak, damp, west-of-Ireland October evening, I checked in at St Brigid's hospital school of nursing to start my training as a psychiatric nurse. </p> <p>Talk about gender issues: women students had what we males thought was Hilton-quality accommodation off-site, while we \"slept in\" in shared rooms alongside the mainly long-stay wards in the \"old building\", as it was called. Once the Connacht Lunatic Asylum, the hospital had been built by the British in 1833 in the classic rotunda and wing-landing style with clock tower and enclosed yard, as familiar to prisoners as to patients. </p> <p>It hadn't changed much by 1964. There were 1,652 patients and I could immediately identify institutionalisation: its smell, in your nose and on your clothes; its structure; its architecture; its very essence unmistakable. Most of us young bloods were quickly assimilated. </p> <p>That first night-sleep-in was frightening. Pass key in hand, I made my way along dim, desolate corridors to my room on ward 12. Only then did I realise that my room mate and I shared bathroom and toilet facilities with 60 long-stay patients. Constipation and retention of urine were real possibilities for an 18-year-old. </p> <p>Just then, ambling up the corridor in his nightshirt, came a man I later grew to love and respect. Paddy G was his name and he had his own 40-year milestone, but his was as a long-stay patient. \"Aha!\" he laughed. \"The new junior man, be God, you've got 30 to do 'til you get the pension, do ya want a cup of tae?\" Amazingly, he was looking after and reassuring me: empowerment in reverse, perhaps, though at that time nobody (that I knew, at any rate) believed that might ever become a reality. </p> <p>If Paddy G had said to me then that I might become a long-stay nurse, perhaps semi-institutionalised with a house and family nearby, but that before I could get my pension years in the whole hospital would be closed - and almost all the others in the British Isles shut down - I would have thought he was surely in the right place. And yet that is almost exactly what has happened. </p> <p>Only the most structurally rigid institutions, and of course the secure hospitals, have hung on. Yet even their demise is inevitable: only the time frame is debatable. And the single most important force which changed institutional care to community care, which turned depersonalisation into something approaching empowerment, which influenced modifications on medical models and changed the cultural mindset of professionals towards their vulnerable \"clients\", \"patients\" or \"service users\", was, and remains, the social work profession. The evidence for its importance to the lives and wellbeing of vulnerable people is overwhelming. </p> <p>On October 1 this year I had a very different sort of check-in. I was at Cranfield University, one of the top 10 business schools across the world, for a reunion to celebrate my MBA graduation there in 1984. Many colleagues from that year returned for the two-day get-together and it was wonderful. It also gave me an opportunity to benchmark myself against their achievements. I won't be writing to my mother. The colleague who sat next to me as a student, and was unfailingly helpful, is now chief executive of a \u00a350bn turnover company. </p> <p>Cranfield taught me many things and changed my middle life just as significantly as working in mental health changed my young life. At St Brigid's, I observed the ingredients that lead to institutionalisation and stagnation; at Cranfield, I absorbed the chemistry of change, growth, ambition, innovation, implementation, research and, most of all, the commitment to making it happen. </p> <p>My feeling for social care and health today is that the whole business would line up much closer to the Cranfield way of life than to the culture I joined in 1964. That is good for us all. </p> <p><strong>&amp;#183</strong>Tom Dervin is director of social services for Newcastle upon Tyne.

And how does he expect active and successful branches such as mine to support his proposals when he sends me an email saying: \"Because these proposals have to be effective for branches that are struggling, it is likely they will cause most problems for branches that are working very effectively\"?<br> <strong>Alan Fowler</strong> <br> Chairman, Alzheimer's Society, Winchester &amp; district branch </p> <p><strong> Policy debate</strong><br> </p> <p>Much has been written of the desirability of individuals making provision for the care needs of themselves and their dependants in old age (Opinion, October 13). Accordingly, in 1996 I invested \u00a310,000 of savings in a Long Term Care Bond promoted by a reputable company (Scottish Amicable, since taken over by Prudential), the declared purpose of which was \"to provide the chosen level of care throughout the insured individual's [my wife's] life\" in the event of my predeceasing her. </p> <p>In June this year, however, she was informed by the company that such cover could expire on her reaching 84 years of age - even if no claim had been made before that date - and no rebate would be forthcoming. Clearly if, as has been mooted, such provision is to be encouraged by government, it is essential legislation to ensure genuine life-long cover is available. My experience also emphasises the importance of carefully reading the small print of such policies. <br> <strong>Bob Heyes</strong><br> Halifax </p> <p><strong> Power struggle</strong><br> </p> <p>I'm sure that it is the case that Tory and LibDem voters in Leeds did not support either party in June with a view to them propping up a Labour administration (Leeds united, October 13). I can see that it makes sense, then, for them to prop each other up, even if this does bring into question the sometime LibDem profile of being to the left of Blair. </p> <p>Your article also mentions, but does not explain, that the Greens are part of the ruling group. I would very much like to know why, especially since they are not holding the balance of power. </p> <p>I have, over the years, voted Green on occasion, but I would think hard about doing so if I thought the result would be a Tory or LibDem administration. <br> <strong>Keith Flett</strong> <br> London </p> <p><strong> Join the club</strong><br> </p> <p> I read with interest, but not agreement, David Brindle's piece on car ownership (Opinion, October 6). I do agree that flexibility is needed; however, that can be achieved much more effectively by the introduction of car clubs. We have a rapidly growing scheme of this type in Brighton and Hove. </p> <p>It means that those who do not have a car could have access for times of need, and those who presently own a car could dispose of it. After all, most people do not use a car 24 hours a day, so people such as the shift workers cited by Brindle would be able to have access to a car during the antisocial hours during which they are employed. </p> <p>It is much cheaper than car owner ship, avoids the \"dead space\" of cars clogging up the streets in congested areas, and, most important of all, studies show that those who join a car club are much more likely to mix and match their transport modes, thus leading to a reduction in pollution and CO2 emissions. <br> <strong>Councillor Joyce Edmond-Smith</strong> <br> Convenor, Sustainability Commission, Brighton &amp; Hove city council </p> <p><strong> Burden of care</strong><br> </p> <p> The story of Andrew Entwistle is a touching one but leaves a great deal unsaid (Men about the house, October 6). </p> <p>In the piece, we are told nothing of any attempts to obtain care for his mother at home. Nursing and care agencies do exist that could have taken the burden off him for at least part of the day. Such care agencies do not, of course, come cheap. For example, the typical cost in London is \u00a315 per hour, which adds up to \u00a3600 per five-day week for an eight-hour day. </p> <p>Entwistle presumably receives attendance allowance. He can apply for \"direct payments\" from his local authority. Unfortunately, the Act of Parliament is highly ambiguous, stating that patients must be capable of managing direct payments either themselves or \"with such assistance as may be available\". </p> <p>Local authorities interpret this in a wide variety of ways. Some carers have obtained these funds without difficulty, while one had to go as far as the ombudsman to obtain financial support. </p> <p>Carers have enough problems without having to contend with gross inconsistencies in policy. Information on one's rights is also hard to get. These matters need urgent attention. <br> <strong>Duncan Hutchison</strong><br> London </p> <p><strong> Natural solution</strong><br> </p> <p>George Monbiot omits one of the most powerful arguments for wind power (Blow by blow, October 6). </p> <p>If, or when, we have finished with a wind turbine, it can be taken down. The hole for the foundation is rather big, but the soil that came out of it can be replaced, thus restoring the ground to its original use. You can't say that of a nuclear power station. <br> <strong>Tim Gossling</strong><br> Cambridge</p>",
  "<p>If social care services and their partners in local government are going to get right the new agendas of investment in people and communities, their leadership skills are going to be tested to the limits. An enabling, empowering agenda needs enabling, empowering leadership of the highest calibre as never before. </p> <p>Leaders in social work and social care have many roles. They come as councillors, chairs, board members, chief officers and managers in a range national and local organisations. None of the roles is comfortable: the services exist in a fast- moving, competitive world as councils strive for stars and comprehensive performance assessment ratings. </p> <p>To these leaders falls the responsibility of ensuring organisations are up with - or even better, way ahead of - the field. One study recently concluded that \"the higher performing an organisation, the more it must operate at the edge of control, like an ocean racer or downhill skier\". </p> <p>Directors of social services often come across incredible examples of selfless efforts by staff who go way beyond duty to improve people's lives. All this while remaining among the lowest paid of local government staff. It really is time that pay and status, especially for residential and homecare workers, was fundamentally reviewed upwards. </p> <p>Retention means giving staff the encouragement and room to achieve, showing trust and letting committed people off the leash. Social care managers must stop drowning people in top-down initiatives, strategies and procedures that can create a risk avoidance culture. </p> <p>Good staff expect bad practice to be rooted out and prevented from recurring: social care leaders are expected to deliver on this. But high quality practice is actually far more common and all too often unrecognised. Local government and social care agencies must make it their business to find out about the good things that are happening, and shout about them from the rooftops. </p> <p>It's amazing how coy we are about our real achievements: keeping a family together, for example. Or helping an abused child find an alternative home. Or offering practical help in a catastrophe. Finding and celebrating achievement is something managers don't do enough of. </p> <p>The best leaders know where their organisation is going, and make sure everyone else does. They don't micromanage: they get on with it and are decisive when things need to be done. Most importantly, good leaders never abrogate their own responsibility and accountability, in particular to those children, adults, families and communities who use their services. </p> <p>Equally, good leaders should embrace new ideas and technologies. Can directors of social services honestly say they are championing how new technology can improve access to services, improve the speed and effectiveness of delivery, and promote work-life balance for our valued staff? </p> <p>Are colleagues using technology themselves? The tough message here is, how do we know we're part of the solution and not part of what's holding things back? </p> <p>We should also be prepared to commit ourselves to real partnerships. To do this effectively, social care leaders must work in true partnership within councils and across bodies and organisations with overlapping agendas. We should think big, not territorially. Celebrate others' success, and never go for, or brag about, cheap victories. That's leadership by Sumo wrestling, damaging and rarely about improving anyone's quality of life at all. </p> <p>Last but not least, social care leaders should create a buzz around themselves: use effective appraisal systems to motivate people and make sure they're resilient enough to see change through. Are social care organisations stimulating, fulfilling and enjoyable places to work? If the place isn't buzzing, then it's down to the people who lead them. </p> <p>And don't forget our own learning needs. Some advice? How about all of us who lead in social work and social care setting ourselves personal development targets for the coming year, and getting just that bit more equipped for the challenges ahead?</p> <p><strong>&amp;#183</strong>Tony Hunter is incoming president of the Association of Directors of Social Services</p>",
  "<p>Jack Hill feels empowered. Not that he would use that term, but his comments say as much. \"I never used to get a choice,\" he says. \"But the thing is, I was relatively new to receiving social services and I didn't fully realise I was being treated like a child until the new service began. I was being led by the hand and shoved here and there. I thought this was the norm.\"</p> <p>The \"new service\" is not, in fact, new but the result of a fundamental rethink of domiciliary or home care provision by Hartlepool council. It's a rethink that aimed to put care users like Hill at the centre of service planning, responding to their wishes and preferences not treating them as passive recipients of a standard formula.</p> <p>\"We identified a shortfall both in the quality of service being delivered and outcomes for service users,\" says Phil Hornsby, the council's principal commissioning manager. \"People said they wanted us to take notice of them, listen to them and talk to them, rather than being told: 'This is what's best for you.'\" </p> <p>It sounds simple, but it is something many commissioners and providers of services for older people fail to grasp. A report last week from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, reviewing four years of work by 17 projects in its older people's research programme, concluded that services were still shaped by a \"deficit model\" of old age, characterising the recipient as a vulnerable victim of an incurable condition. At the other extreme, this was set against an \"aspirational model\" whereby successful ageing was equated with a capacity to compete with younger people in physically challenging activities such as rock climbing or bungee jumping. Neither model reflected the lives of the vast majority of older people. </p> <p>Hornsby tells how Hartlepool's reshaped domiciliary service has addressed the needs of one man discharged from hospital back to his home. Simply by listening to him, care commissioners were able to identify his goals and help him realise them.</p> <p>\"He told us: 'I want to get up, have my breakfast, look at the Racing Post, go down the betting shop and have a couple of bets, come home and watch the TV and, hopefully, go and collect my winnings at the end of the day',\" Hornsby recalls. \"We focused on giving him the confidence to do that and he is thriving. It has given him back his life.\" </p> <p>Hartlepool spends about \u00a32m a year on domiciliary care for some 500 people. Until it reviewed the service, it was using nine care agencies plus its own in-house team to deliver 4,500 hours of care each week. Under the shake-up, which took full effect from October 1, the number of agencies under contract has been cut to three and the in-house team now specialises in short-term, intensive support for people discharged from hospital. </p> <p>Users of the service were brought in to help decide which agencies should be chosen for the new contracts: they helped draft contracts and even sat on interview panels. Each of the three successful agencies now has an area to cover, their income is guaranteed and contract rates have been increased - an improvement the council hopes to see reflected in care workers' pay. </p> <p>Ann Coppinger is a proprietor of Community and Homecare Services, one of the chosen agencies, which employs 65 care workers in Hartlepool. She likes the new system: \"It's effective for us as a company because we are able to manage our services better and, incrementally, it should improve the care provided to service users. It's easier to feed back their needs and, because we are moving away from being task-orientated, we are able to be more flexible in response. </p> <p>\"There's a much improved sense of partnership working with Hartlepool council, too: we have been allocated our own team of social workers, that we work with closely, and we even have our own invoice clerks to deal with.\" </p> <p>The reshaped system has been bedding in over the summer. Jack Hill has noticed the difference not just from his own perspective, but also from that of his wife, Shirley, who is his carer. \"She's a different person,\" he says. \"I genuinely thought that she was heading for a nervous breakdown. Now everything about the service puts her at ease and she is confident that I am being looked after.\" Shirley Hill says: \"The new care workers talk to Jack like a human being, as an intelligent man. The effect on him has been marvellous. He is able to do so much more for himself.\" </p> <p>This must be music to the ears of Ian Philp, the government's older people's \"tsar\", who will tomorrow be sharing a platform with Hartlepool at the social services conference. He has been banging the drum for \"person-centred\" care, ensuring older people are treated with dignity and respect, but he now wants to push further. He wants to see older people take control of their care. </p> <p>Says Philp, a medical specialist in rehabilitation: \"In future we have to be much bolder. And the way of truly liberating older people in the care system is to ensure that real power passes to them and their families in terms of decision making.\" </p> <p>Philip is finalising a progress report on the national service framework for older people's services, unveiled in 2001. But he will be speaking tomorrow about developing its underlying principles, stressing also what he sees as the \"transformational potential\" (given sufficient IT investment) of the idea of a single assessment of an individual's needs. As well as hardening up the principle of person-centred care, Philp will discuss focusing health promotion on marginalised groups, and moving from rapid response to anticipating people's needs. \"We have known for 40 years that it's important to do that, but we have never had a mechanism to achieve it,\" he says. \"I think the single assessment process does give us that opportunity.\" Finally, Philp wants to kick on the debate about joined-up services so that care commissioners think in terms, borrowed from the US, of \"segment and marshal\" - segment service users by their needs and marshal available resources accordingly. Critically, resources must be marshalled across service boundaries. </p> <p>With due respect to the Rowntree report, Philp is impatient with those who take a glass-half-empty view of older people's services: \"I think we should be striking an optimistic tone. Looking back on the three years' work that I have been involved with nationally, you'd have to say that we have produced real benefits for older people.\"</p>",
  "The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg yesterday exposed a large gap in Britain's immigration laws when it ruled that a Chinese woman who travelled to Belfast to have her child has the right to live in Britain because the child became an Irish citizen by birth and therefore an EU national. <p>The court ruled that Kunquian Catherine Zhu, now aged four and living with her mother, Man Levette Chen, in Cardiff, is entitled under the EU treaty as a national of the EU to live in any member state as long as she is covered by sickness insurance and has enough resources - in this case provided by her mother - not to rely on public funds.</p> <p>The child's rights as an EU national also give her mother the right to long-term residence, the court ruled.</p> <p>The Irish government now plans to change its law to block the loophole, following a referendum in which the public backed the change by four to one.</p> <p>The court held that because Catherine receives private medical treatment and child care, paid for by her mother, and is not dependent on the state, she is entitled to live in Britain as an EU national.</p> <p>The European judges ruled that it was irrelevant that Mrs Chen had travelled to Belfast specifically to enable the child she was expecting to acquire the nationality of an EU member state.</p> <p>The Luxembourg court was told Mrs Chen knew that giving birth in Britain would not give her new baby automatic residency rights because of the terms of the British Nationality Act. But she also knew that choosing Northern Ireland guaranteed Irish nationality, which is granted to anyone born anywhere on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>Once that was achieved, the plan was for her daughter to live in the UK under EU rules which allow nationals of one member state, such as Ireland, the right to settle in another.</p> <p>The plan was hatched because Mrs Chen and her husband already had a son and could not have another in their own country under China's \"one-child\" rule. So when she was six months pregnant with her second baby in mid-2000, she moved to Belfast.</p> <p>Mrs Chen was \"over the moon\" with the judgment and now plans to settle in Cardiff with her daughter, said her solicitor, Michael Barry.</p> <p>His client, whose family runs an international chemical firm, first visited the Welsh capital on business, he said.</p> <p>The case was referred to the Luxembourg court by the Immigration Appellate Authority after Mrs Chen appealed against the refusal of a residence permit.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Preamble</strong> What a cracker we're in for tonight. Two teams of outstanding attacking talent and flair going straight at each other. Sadly, I'm not allowed to watch the Milan - Barcelona game as, after a last-minute switch, I'm lumbered with covering Arsenal's attempt to take their Premiership form into Europe against Panathinaikos. I was supposed to be doing the Chelsea game, so unfortunately all my lengthy research into the CSKA Moscow team has flown out of the window. You will forgive me, therefore, if my report contains few of the tricky Greek names. In fact, to get them out of the way, here are the line-ups in full.</p> <p><strong>Teams</strong> </p> <p>Panathinaikos: Chalkias, Morris, Goumas, Gonzalez, Kirgiakos, Konstantinou, Basinas, Mitu, Vyntra, Skacel, Konstantinidis. Subs: Galinovic, Henriksen, Kotsolis, Maric, Epalle, Sapanis, Olisadebe. </p> <p>Arsenal: Lehmann, Lauren, Toure, Campbell, Cole, Ljungberg, Edu, Fabregas, Pires, Reyes, Henry. Subs: Taylor, Van Persie, Flamini, Cygan, Senderos, Pennant, Larsson. </p> <p>The last time these two clashed - in the group stage in 2001 - Panathinaikos actually beat Arsenal 1-0 and went on to win the group. Arsene Wenger will send out his strongest team tonight - minus Patrick Vieira and Dennis Bergkamp, whose fear of flying has left him watching the game in a north London pub - to ensure the same will not happen again. After two disappointing performances in the tournament so far, the Gunners could do with a positive result here to send out a message to the Continent and to Manchester United, whom they meet on Sunday.</p> <p>Charlie Nicholas has just claimed that Jose Reyes is the best dribbler since Diego Maradona. The jokes here are just too easy, so I will leave them out. But can this be true? Cristiano Ronaldo for one might disagree. </p> <p><strong>Emails</strong> Steven, who is stuck in Poland without a tv, says: \"How come we changed journalists all of a sudden? What have you done to Sean?\" Mr Ingle had an anecdote to tell about John Terry which, quite frankly, is more than I had to offer on the game at Stamford Bridge. So we swapped.</p> <p>Brian Byer, meanwhile, asks what I think is a question: \"Gonzalez is a Greek name?\" Clearly not - he is from Argentina and I can also tell you his first name is Ezekiel.</p> <p>Apparently the last time these teams met there was a big fight which, according to Martin Tyler, was \"unforgettable\". I can't remember it though.</p> <p><strong>2 mins</strong> It takes 78 seconds, but finally a Panathinaikos player touches the ball - their goalie. A confident start for Arsenal.</p> <p>Jonathan Cardy mentions that Ryan Giggs might have something to say about the best dribbler since Maradona. Yeah, he might mention Ronaldo's name too.</p> <p><strong>3 mins</strong> Basinas, who was in the winning Greek team at Euro 2004, fires a shot past the far post from the edge of the box. Jens Lehmann had it covered, but that's not to say he necessarily would have saved it.</p> <p><strong>4 mins</strong> Panathinaikos attack down the right and Konst...Konstat...Konstan...the big lad up front plays a good ball to the near post which Sol Campbell has to put behind.</p> <p><strong>7 mins</strong> Reyes is writhing around in pain after a terrible tackle by his marker. He obviously heard Charlie Nicholas before the game. Chelsea are one up in their match - John Terry the scorer. That'll be game over then.</p> <p>Brian Marples is a charming man: \"Hey Michael, welcome to M-by-M. Why the new-oxford.com email tag, has Barry patented the guardian.com M-by-M tag?\" Don't know really - you never know with Barry. Surely it should be me who welcomes you to the minute-by-minute?</p> <p><strong>11 mins</strong> The game has started again after a lengthy delay for Reyes' injury. Wenger looks mildly concerned.</p> <p><strong>14 mins</strong> The Greeks look impressive. Basinas had far too much time in the middle of the pitch and elected to have a pop at goal from about 30 yards. Lehmann parried the fizzing ball away.</p> <p>Julien Labonne has a good idea: \"They should organize a 'dribbling contest' between Reyes and Ronaldo this sunday at half time.\" It should be like football training when you're a young lad - with cones close together and the first one to go out and back wins. It would make great viewing.</p> <p><strong>17 mins</strong> Reyes is back on the pitch and causing mischief around the box. One ball nearly finds Ljungberg but the ball is just flicked away by the defender.</p> <p><strong>GOAL!!!! Panathinaikos 0 - 1 Arsenal (Ljungberg 18)</strong> An action replay of my earlier update, with Reyes nudging a ball through the Greek defence for Ljungberg to run onto and dink over the onrushing keeper. A beautifully crafted goal. Now, can Arsenal press on and really dominate this game for once?</p> <p><strong>21 mins</strong> John Hansson says: \"The best dribbler in the game today has to be Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\" Each to his own, John. Mind you, I remember seeing him score one Mardadona-esque goal once.</p> <p> <strong>24 mins</strong> Lehmann is going crazy (any need for the word \"going\"?) because Gonzalez just had a free header which he directed wide of the goal.</p> <p><strong> 27 mins</strong> A Thierry Henry burst down the left from which the Frenchman delivers a cross to Robert Pires. His feeble effort to head the ball was laughable to be honest, the defender taking it off him easily.</p> <p>Keith Miller writes: \"My granddad has to be the best dribbler in the world - half the time he doesn't even know he's doing it.\" </p> <p><strong>31 mins</strong> Both teams are currently playing the game at a walking pace. This might have something to do with the fact it is after 11 o'clock in Athens - the players might even be breaking a curfew. Schevchenko has scored to put Milan one up against Barcelona. My mind is not elsewhere. Honestly.</p> <p><strong>34 mins</strong> Arsenal are in cruise control at the moment. Edu and Fabregas are just keeping the ball, taking the sting out of the home team and their fans. The impression is that they can step up a gear or two at any time. I wish they would do it soon though.</p> <p><strong>37 mins</strong> Panathinaikos have a free-kick in a dangerous position to the left of the penalty area. Now, will we have an attempt on goal?</p> <p><strong>38 mins</strong> There is indeed. As Arsenal only have Campbell and Toure who can head a ball it perhaps was not too surprising that one of the Greeks climbed highest, but Lehmann was able to watch it sail wide.</p> <p><strong>40 mins</strong> Ljungberg faces up to Kiriakos after the Greek lunged in on Lauren. Calvin Klein models, eh - such troublemakers.</p> <p><strong>42 mins</strong> The Gunners are dropping like flies. It's Reyes' turn to be on the floor again, clutching his face after Mitu poked him in the eye. Arsene Wenger is not a happy man, especially as the fourth official is completely ignoring him.</p> <p><strong>45 mins</strong> Basinas' effort floats onto the top of the netting. Close, but never really threatening Lehmann's goal.</p> <p><strong>44 mins</strong> Now Kolo Toure is in agony after, erm, tackling Konstantinou. There should probably be about 10 minutes of injury-time, but thankfully the ref has shown pity on us onlookers by announcing there will be just two extra minutes. Ah, Panathinaikos have a free-kick in prime position.</p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Hardly thrilling stuff, but Arsenal will be fairly happy with the first three quarters of an hour. In fact, the Gunners will be more concerned by the nature of some of the Greek challenges than the Greeks' attacking play. Fergie will be rubbing his hands with glee watching this.</p> <p><strong>Other half-time scores</strong><br> Rosenborg 1 - 1 PSV<br> Milan 1 - 0 Barcelona<br> Donetsk 0 - 0 Celtic<br> Anderlecht 1 - 1 Werder Bremen<br> Valencia 0 - 0 Inter<br> Chelsea 2 - 0 CSKA Moscow<br> PSG 2 - 0 Porto</p> <p><strong>Emails</strong> Keith Cundale writes: \"I thought you might like to know that, as we speak, Perth, Western Australia, is experiencing a stonking storm: thunder, lightning, the odd manic dog and tons of rain. Just the old country hey? Clearly this storm is keeping me awake, otherwise why else would I be up at 3.30am to read about '1-0 to the Arsenal'? Do you think its worth me staying up, or should I try to sleep now and read the headlines later? Stay up Keith, it can only get better. Can't it? Please?</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kes argues from a different continent: \"Just to add my tuppence worth on your dribbling debate: as a long suffering Leeds fan exiled in Hong Kong I admit that the closest my team has come to witnessing dribbling is watching Darren Huckerby do his impersonation of Forest Gump a few seasons back; however, I am sat here (3:oo am and work in the morn) watching Milan v Barca and neither Ronaldo or Reyes are the best dribbler since Ronaldinho!\" Ah, Ronaldinho. Goofy but brilliant.</p> <p>Steve Tait has another candidate: \"What about Damien Duff for best dribbler? He'd go round those half time cones like nobody's business.\"</p> <p><strong>47 mins</strong> The little Greek left-back is not best pleased with the little Greek right-back, who didn't really attack his cross at the back post with any real vigour. Now Panathinaikos want a penalty. For what, I cannot tell you. All I can tell you is that Campbell made a perfectly good tackle in the box.</p> <p>Keith has written to say he is staying awake, so is rewarded with another mention: \"As I'm awake now, can anyone tell me why Ronaldinho, who according to ESPN earlier tonght has everything in the world going for him, doesn't invest a tiny part of his weekly dosh for some new teeth?\" One of the great mysteries. Ronaldo could tag along with him to the dentist.</p> <p><strong>50 mins</strong> This is slightly better from the team in Green. Gonzalez has a shot from 20 yards which goes straight at Lehmann. Now Campbell has to make a last-ditch tackle with the Argentine bearing down on goal. He had to make contact with the ball or he could have been having an early bath.</p> <p><strong>53 mins</strong> Reyes is getting retribution for his rough treatment in the first half, crunching late tackles on two players in the space of a minute. With lehmann miskicking a clearance, the English champions are looking somewhat ruffled.</p> <p><strong>56 mins</strong> This game is folloiwing a similar pattern to all of Arsenal's European games. It's almost as if it's too easy for them as they sit back and invite pressure. Thierry Henry has been particularly lacklustre so far, but Panathinaikos are yet to capitalise.</p> <p> Phil writes: \"Hey, if they're letting just about anyone do M-by-M's these days, can I have a go? I'll never see a Champions League game live as I'm stuck at work here in New York. But if you like I could do a P-by-P of tonight's Yankee-Boston decider.\" Just about anyone? Cheeky beggar. I would certainly tune into the baseball coverage were the game not on tv. You can keep me informed on the Cards-Astros match though.</p> <p><strong>59 mins</strong> A let-off for Arsenal: from a throw-in, Gonzalez lays the ball off to Mitu who half-volleys the ball just wide of the post. Lehmann certainly wouldn't have reached that one. </p> <p><strong>62 mins</strong> Panathinaikos are making a change, bringing on Nigerian-turned-Polish livewire Emanuel Olisadebe. Konstantinou is the one making way, something my typing fingers don't mind. Arsenal have had one shot on goal so far - a damning statistic. But, of course, the only statistic that really matters is the one at the top of the screen.</p> <p><strong>GOAL!!!! Panathinaikos 1 - 1 Arsenal (Gonzalez 64) </strong> The statistic at the top of the screen has changed! A phenomenal goal. Here goes my description, which just won't do it justice. Lehmann came charging out of his goal unnecessarily to head the ball out of danger, but he could only reach Gonzalez out on the right wing. The Argentine launched a volley from 35 yards back over Lehmann's curly hair and flailing hand, bouncing just before it hit the net. Arsenal do not deserve to be wining, and now they are not.</p> <p><strong>68 mins</strong> If Arsenal played at the same pace as they do in the Premiership, they would be comfortably in the lead. But even the goal has not sparked a reaction, with Panathinaikos the team looking to secure the three points.</p> <p>Jussi Keinonen, meanwhile, has an interesting theory: \"Ronaldinho shouldn't fix his his teeth for marketing reasons. In this fast-paced visual world you have advantage of being different. After all those braced teeth some Hollywood actors are now getting their teeth fixed to look like unfixed. And they still can't dribble.\"</p> <p><strong>70 mins</strong> With a free-kick just outside the Panathinaikos box, it looked like Arsenal might manage their second shot on target. Then they allowed Edu to take it. Now some chap in row Z has had a touch of the ball he wasn't expecting.</p> <p><strong>73 mins</strong> A long-range shot from Basinas flies well wide of the Arsenal goal.</p> <p>Brian Marples writes: \"Mention Hideki Matsui in your M-by-M then he'll have made an appearance in both tonights games - how likely was that, a reference to a New York-based Japanese baseball player in two Champions league M-by-M's reports?\" I'm always one to please, so there you go. Those Japanese do get everywhere don't they. They'll probably be taking photos of these reports now. </p> <p><strong>GOAL!!!! Panathinaikos 1 - 2 Arsenal (Henry 74) </strong> Cole surges down the left-wing and then centres to Henry who clinically strokes the ball into the corner. So easy, so why did it take 74 minutes for them to burst into life? </p> <p><strong>77 mins</strong> The game is dying a very slow death. The crowd, who turned up three hours before kick-off apparently, are already leaving. They're only one goal down for crying out loud!</p> <p><strong>GOAL!!!! Panathinaikos 2 - 2 Arsenal (Olisadebe 81)</strong> From a corner, Olisadebe rises unchallenged to nod the ball into the empty goal - empty because Lehmann had taken a trip to No Man's Land. Sol Campbell and Edu were the nearest to Olisadebe but both were stood like statues as he attacked the ball.</p> <p><strong>84 mins</strong> Chalkias, the Panathinaikos keeper, has just made a wonderful double save - first diving to block Cole's drive, then pouncing on Pires' close-range effort from the rebound. I told you this game would explode into life!</p> <p><strong>87 mins</strong> Finally Arsenal are exhibiting some of the drive and determination they show week-in week-out in England. The Greeks are defending doggedly though, leaving Henry looking downhearted.</p> <p><strong>90 mins</strong> Vintra has finally been booked after an evening of fouling Reyes. Had he been shown a yellow card in the first half like he should have been, Reyes may have had a bigger impact on the game.</p> <p>Tafari Smith says: \"In the name of proper journalism you must now mention Curt Schilling from the Boston Red Sox to balance out the blatant spreading of Yankee-ism throughout the world done by the Matsui fan.\" Being a Red Sox fan, I'm more than willing to help out there. What a game Schilling pitched last night.</p> <p><strong>Full time</strong> The ref performs a beautiful melody on his whistle to indicate he's had enough of this game. The tabloids will slate the Gunners once more for another disappointing European performance. With five points from three games, this result won't harm their chances of qualification, but, with the talent they have at their disposal, they shouldn't be making such heavy work of these trips abroad. Thanks for all your emails, Mike.</p>",
  "<p>In her book, Another World is Possible if ..., Susan George, key thinker of the global justice movement (she thinks the term \"anti-globalisation\" is inaccurate and a bit demeaning, because the movement is proposing a more just, equitable and sustainable version of international co-operation), argues that knowledge and understanding must be key components of building a movement for social change. The world is complicated, the causes of human hardship are increasingly harder to understand, let alone challenge, good knowledge is crucial to making good political choices. </p> <p>Not much here that those of us who work in education could disagree with - because, regardless of political affiliation, we tend to agree with Ms George that we have a special and central role in shaping the world. If nothing else, more education certainly gives you a sense of self-importance.</p> <p>\"The global social justice movement seems to have a disproportionate number of educators in its ranks, which is an excellent thing because teachers and academics have particularly serious responsibilities for world-changing,\" she says in her book. </p> <p>In fact, Ms George is a bit scolding when she writes about the role of educators. Institutional pressures, the imperatives of career building, the difficulty of getting a permanent job and the suspicion of unorthodox ways of thinking and writing - all of this militates against academics playing a useful role in understanding and changing our world. We are too busy trying to gain favour and recognition within our disciplines and from our higher-ups to risk writing anything that ordinary people might want to read. </p> <p>Playing within the rules of the university is more likely to make us into barriers to social change - protecting and measuring our specialisms for the purposes of ratings and funding, but shying away from anything as controversial as accessible political education. Properly told off, and like a lot of other educators, I trekked off to Alexandra Palace to see what I could learn and unlearn. </p> <p>In the end, the European Social Forum last weekend proved to be slightly alarming, yet oddly familiar. I'm not so good with crowds and noise - of course preferring the calm and sobriety of library and senior common room - and such a concentrated collection of long lost friends and half-forgotten enemies brought out my worst anti-social tendencies. At the same time, the whole event was reminiscent of large academic conferences with endless parallel sessions and many delegates lost in transit and content to hang out in the spaces in between. So although I am glad I went, I am more glad it is over and there is space again to think about every day campaigning and education without the hurly-burly of the fair.</p> <p>Of course, it is partly my own fault for not being involved in the planning and instead waiting to be told how my various affiliations might want to use the event. And I did see some actual dialogue, some of which was seriously strange - my favourite head-imploding moment coming when the speaker berated the Trotskyist left for confusing genuine national liberation movements and the counter-revolutionary forces of Hungary in 1956 and, over time, contributing to the destruction of the glorious revolutionary example of the Soviet Union, a tirade that was met with remarkable good humour from other speakers and much hilarity from the audience. </p> <p>But mainly the event seemed to be a lot of very old-style meetings all at once, with endless speakers and questions from the floor that turned out to be yet more speeches. Overall, and not for the first time, I came away convinced that we really need to find other ways of speaking to each other. </p> <p>In this vein, one of my favourite lessons in how to learn came from Tariq Ramadan, a leading Islamic scholar who has been denied his visa to take up an academic position in the US.</p> <p>Professor Ramadan, who has become something of a pin-up for the promotion of inter-cultural dialogue, stressed the need to avoid confusing a global movement for social justice with a standardised movement that saw one solution for all. And although this can be hard terrain right now, he gave a pretty engaging, not to mention charming, account of how we must learn from and listen to each other. The prevailing climate of anxiety around security has created a psychology of fear in the population at large, exacerbating divisions and suspicions - so dialogue is difficult, but urgently necessary.</p> <p>Professor Ramadan argued that there is a lack of mutual trust in the way different communities live together - and for those interested in social justice this raised the question of how we can understand that; although we don't come from the same background, we can have common values. Such an understanding must recognise that we share the same values and principles - but not the same models for achieving these goals. As an example, he cited his own work as an attempt to create a liberation theology coming out of the Islamic world, a theology that could come with a global social justice perspective and be grounded within the traditions and histories of the Islamic world - something that contemporary western perspectives seem unable to imagine. Even within the ESF, he suggested, there were some simplistic ways of thinking about others (my sister tells me that at another meeting someone from the floor tried to shout him off the stage). Much better to stretch and to respect each other's complexity. Hard ideas lucidly expressed, and with some laughs along the way. I'm using him as my role model to become a less shameful type of educator.</p>"
