  "<p>It did not take long for me to realise what it means to people that I am an Olympic champion. </p> <p>I was still coming to terms with what a magnificent thing the 4x100 metres relay team had achieved when I got a telephone call from my 15-year-old brother Tyroe. </p> <p>He said I was his hero. I said: \"Man, you're crazy. I'm just Mark.\" But he replied, \"Nah, don't you realise you are an Olympic champion. That's massive.\" </p> <p>I guess it will take a while to sink in: I am Mark Lewis-Francis, Olympic champion. It feels a lot to take in for a young kid from Birmingham. I have come here, 21 years old, to my first Olympic Games and I am going home today with an Olympic gold medal. </p> <p>An Olympic gold medal. I have to keep looking at it to make sure it is really true. It is what I have been dreaming about since I was a little kid, watching athletics on the TV with my sister and imagining what it would be like to stand on top of the podium and have that medal placed round your neck. </p> <p>Well, now I know. And it is awesome - better even than I imagined. There were so many British supporters in the Olympic Stadium. Everywhere you looked there were British flags and people cheering for us. The moment the national anthem was played is something that I will never forget. </p> <p>After the race I was so hyper. I have not been able to sit down and watch the race yet on television. I am sure I will have plenty more opportunities over the next few months. </p> <p>My memories of the race are a bit vague. I remember seeing Maurice Greene when I was putting down my checkmark and he came over, said hello and shook my hand. </p> <p>I do not know if he was trying to psych me out but it did not work because it made me feel that, if he had recognised me, he must consider me a threat. </p> <p>Before the race me, Jason, Darren and Marlon had discussed the race and about how to deal with the Americans being in the lane outside us. </p> <p>We tried to remain positive and decided that, if I was behind when I got the baton, then that would give me something to chase. And, if I got it and was in front, then he would have to catch me. </p> <p>My other memory is of the gun going and then hearing the recall gun because there was a false start. All the adrenalin disappeared out of my body and I had to quickly psych myself up again. </p> <p>Then it went again and I knew it was for real. The next thing I saw was Marlon haring down on me and me thinking \"This is it!\" All I was focused on was my checkmark. I then experienced a surge of adrenalin from the bottom of my feet all the way to my mouth. It was a crazy feeling but it worked. I knew as soon as I had crossed the line we had won. I know it looked close on the television but as a sprinter you usually know when you have won and when you have lost. So there was no doubt whatsoever in my mind. </p> <p>I had been pretty low after failing to reach the final of the individual 100m but I think this could be the turning point of my career. This has given me a real feeling of what it is like to be successful and I want more of it, much more. </p> <p>I know I have the talent to be successful in the 100m. Maurice Greene has run 9.7sec and he could not catch me. I just need to get it out and I cannot wait to get into winter training ready for next season. </p> <p>But for the moment I am going to enjoy this. Every time I think about what I have achieved I get a tingle all over my body. It is a lovely feeling and, when I hear how much it means to people like Tyroe, it makes it even more special.</p>",
  "<p>In the past two weeks we have seen and heard it all. Whingeing, whining, tantrums and sulks. Accusations of cheating, rule-breaking and of favouritism among judges. If one thing was established in Athens it was that sportsmanship among many is not so much on the wane at this level as on the verge of extinction. There were exceptions of course - athletes who were dignified in success or failure - but sore losers behaving like petulant children were the overriding theme of this games. </p> <p>To catalogue each example would run to several pages. So consider just a few displays of sullen refrain and intolerable moaning from those who felt cheated of what they rightly deserved. Like the ongoing complaints by South Korea about scoring errors in the men's all-round gymnastics competition which saw their representative, Yang Tae Young, take bronze. Or the indignation shown by the Russian gymnast Svetlana Khorkina, awarded silver after a wobbly beam performance, but who stuck out her tongue at television cameras and claimed she would undoubtedly have won if the judges had been Greek. </p> <p>Now the Russian team has added to the furore by moaning to anyone who will listen and to some who will not. Letters have been filed to the IOC regarding both Khorkina's result and that of another of their gymnasts, Alexei Nemov, apparently denied a medal by dubious judging on the high bars. </p> <p>In the pool we heard the US swimmer Aaron Peirsol accuse a Japanese breaststroker of outright cheating which prevented an American victory. And Peirsol himself came under attack for an illegal backstroke turn that, had it led to disqualification, would have meant a bronze for Britain's James Goddard. </p> <p>Even the Greek crowd competed for a medal in public stroppiness by heckling about the withdrawal of Kostas Kederis from the 200m. Whatever happened to composure in defeat and a measured appreciation of winning or losing? In Athens they plumbed to new depths of scarcity, yet in many ways what we witnessed at the Olympics was merely a demonstration of the ongoing culture change in sport. Fuelled partly by increases in sponsorship deals, media profile and national expectation, many athletes lost sight of what defines a true champion: that carrying yourself with integrity and self-possession is as important when you win as when you have been painfully beaten. </p> <p>Instead, we see too many examples of those who are clouded by their own egos, those who wrongly assume that a medal is there for the taking and that, if it doesn't end up around their neck, they have been deprived of what rightfully belongs to them. They fail to grasp that in sport, as in life, sometimes decisions, conditions and situations will not go in their favour and that success at anything is never guaranteed. How to change this attitude and reclaim a degree of sportsmanship may prove impossible and, at the very least is fraught with difficulty, but attempts are at least being made by sport itself to salvage its reputation. </p> <p>By establishing a finite end to squabbling and disputes, the Court of Arbitration for Sport provides control over what might otherwise have become mayhem in Athens. It is perhaps a sad indictment of the way things are heading that legal intervention is so often required to determine who should take gold and silver, but there is little doubt that since its creation 21 years ago the CAS has come into its own. Without it, one wonders quite which path things might have taken and, while it may not be the answer to sport's current problems, it provides at least some semblance of balance and rational thought. Never before has sport needed the judgment of the CAS like it needs it now. </p> <p>Meanwhile, some athletes who took centre stage in Athens might do well to re-learn the basic, but all too often forgotten, lessons of sport. Primarily that unpredictability defines athletic competition and that there would be no point in staging an Olympic games if only favourites were to prevail. </p> <p>Stomping your feet in petulance will invariably get you nowhere. By far the biggest winners are those who had their chance and blew it but who accept that with resignation and moved on.</p>",
  "<p>It began with a silver medal in synchronised diving - a discipline most people had never heard of until Britain's seemingly ill-assorted pair plunged to success - and ended with outright victories and a near-miss in the sports that are as old as humankind: running and fighting. In between came disappointment in the pool and on the suburban streets but joy on the lake, on the open sea and on the cycle track. </p> <p>Although no single story could sum up the odyssey of Britain's 271-strong Olympic squad over the past fortnight, one man's tale symbolises the journey from near-disaster to something that could reasonably be described as triumph, while illustrating the effect that the intensity of the games can have on an athlete's resolve. </p> <p>When Darren Campbell walked down the track to his position at the start of the second leg of the 4x100m relay as the games came to a climax in a packed stadium on Saturday night, he knew that failure would mean coming home as the captain of the only men's athletics team to return to Britain without a medal of any sort since the modern Olympic Games began 108 years ago. Inevitably it concentrated his mind. </p> <p>\"Maybe the other three guys weren't aware of it,\" he said, \"but I've been around for a few years and in that time I've been one of the people who go out there and win medals. I didn't believe we'd leave here without something. It was down to us. And the last thing our coach said before we went out was, 'Seize the day.'\" </p> <p>Campbell had failed to make an impact in either of the individual events, ending his heat of the 100m with what looked like a pulled hamstring and finishing last in a semi-final of the 200m, the distance at which he had taken the silver medal in Sydney. At that point he looked like the perfect example of a syndrome of underachievement so worrying that calls were being made for inquiries into the use of national lottery money to fund Britain's athletes. </p> <p>\"Seize the day\" was the thought in the minds of Campbell and his three colleagues as the gun went for the start of the sprint relay. Just a hair over 38 seconds later Mark Lewis-Francis was thrusting his chest across the line and Britain's four sprinters had beaten a quartet including the gold, silver and bronze medal winners in the individual 100m. The men's team had got their medal. </p> <p>Campbell made a long, slow walk back around the track to meet his team-mates. While they were exultant, he appeared sombre. There was a lot on his mind, including revenge on his critics. But inspiration can take many forms. And the quartet embraced each other, the pressure was off the athletics squad. </p> <p>For Team GB a total of nine gold, nine silver and 12 bronze medals from the games of the XXVIII Olympiad represents an advance of two medals on the aggregate achieved in Sydney four years ago and a massive improvement on the gloomy predictions that were circulating within a couple of days of the lighting of the flame on the plain of Amarousion. After Tim Henman, Nicole Cooke and other fancied performers had made disappointing exits, Simon Clegg, the team's chef de mission, found himself having to defend his prediction that Britain would win between six and nine gold medals. </p> <p>There were significant defeats still to come, principally those endured by Paula Radcliffe, caught in the world's spotlight and transfixed by the realisation that all her hopes and plans had come to nothing. Unlike Campbell, the captain of the women's team was offered no third opportunity to redeem her failures. </p> <p>Once we had torn our gaze from Radcliffe's anguish, we could inspect victory in all its hues, and in pretty much exactly the proportions Clegg had promised. No one has ever looked more delighted by a bronze medal than Georgina Harland, whose leap of triumph on the modern pentathlon podium resembled those of Michael Schumacher. And no one has looked more drained and distraught in victory than Matthew Pinsent, whose tears at the end of the epic coxless fours final were as helpless as Radcliffe's but from a very different source. </p> <p>Then there was the remarkable Ben Ainslie's modest acceptance of his due, the exuberance of the three blondes in a boat, the camaraderie of the men of the track cycling team and the extraordinary relationship of Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson, for a couple of days making badminton seem the natural successor to reality TV. This is not to mention the good fortune of the equestrian team, who had already flown home when the Court of Arbitration for Sport upgraded them from bronze medal to silver, with Leslie Law going from silver to gold in the individual event. </p> <p>And Kelly Holmes, of course, the most extraordinary story of Britain's games, the little nugget of ore quarried from the mingled strata of modern Britain, with her story of seven years of injuries and now, all in a single surge, a historic double achieved with supreme confidence. Holmes ran six races in nine days, three in the 800m and three in the 1500m, and she raced them all in exactly the same way, holding back until the final lap and then cruising around the outside of the field to take the victory as she pleased. </p> <p>Or so it seemed. But victory in such races is never achieved without sacrifice and pain. Holmes' triumph was to make it look as if it had all been planned, as much a part of the fortnight as the opening and closing ceremonies. </p> <p>The hidden benefit of an acceptable level of British success is the glow it casts on London's bid to host the 2012 games. Just under a fortnight ago one would not have given much for its chances. Now there may just be sufficient enthusiasm to give the project a following wind. </p> <p>Whether the Greeks are glad to have hosted the 2004 games is harder to assess, since so many of them chose to leave Athens for the fortnight, leaving blocks of empty seats in the minor venues. Their absence certainly contributed to the ease with which traffic flowed around the streets, assisted by the new arterial highway network that will be a major part of the games' legacy to the Greek capital, along with an exemplary metro system. But an Athens deserted by both residents and tourists never quite managed to feel like a city hosting a two-week party. </p> <p>From the point of view of athletes and spectators the various stadiums were exceptional, even when the precincts in which they were located had the feeling of hurriedly abandoned building sites. Last week, however, the city authorities were only beginning to address the problems of residual usage, facing unresolved questions of land ownership and the transfer of publicly funded assets into private hands. Manchester found a solution when it handed the Commonwealth Games stadium over to one of the city's football clubs, and London should be making similar plans now if it hopes to avoid the sort of acrimonious chaos that is likely to be Athens' burden. </p> <p>Greece's athletics chiefs paid the price for not sorting out the Kederis problem long ago but, if the protest that held up the men's 200m final in support of the disgraced sprinter contravened the spirit of the games right on its ancestral doorstep, then, along with Kederis's behaviour, it seemed an accurate reflection of human nature. Certainly no one could blame the Greeks for the decision of a former Catholic priest to interrupt yesterday's marathon by manhandling the leader. </p> <p>Pretty much everything handed down in the myths and philosophies of the ancient Greeks could be found in Athens during the past fortnight. Unseen gods made sport with the fate of mortals while, in the form of runners and jumpers and swimmers and rhythmic gymnasts and all the rest of the 10,500 competitors, idealists confronted cynics in a battle as old as the Athenian hills. The message for London is that, somehow, it seemed worth all the trouble.</p>",
  "<p>In a hushed and empty room, with the blinds shut against the afternoon sunshine, the Bogyman rocks slowly in his chair. His head hangs low in the murky light as he reads the words which describe his violent past. He smiles grimly when one of his new followers calls him \"the spawn of the devil\" and warns that he should \"brace himself for more abuse than any serial killer\". </p> <p>With five days left before the start of another rugby season, the squeamish and easily frightened should look away now. The arrival in England of Corne Krige, the former Springbok captain who is accused by many in this country of being the dirtiest player in international rugby, has already unleashed a wave of horror - and that's just among the supporters of his own team. </p> <p>\"I've seen this one,\" Krige says quietly as he waves a copy of an anguished article from a Northampton website. \"It's quite amusing. Listen to this: 'The hawks on the far right would happily embrace a Saints back-row of Corne Krige, Freddie Kruger and Osama bin Laden if it guaranteed us winning the Premiership, the Powergen Cup and the Heineken Cup.' I like that one. I want to win some trophies here.\" </p> <p>He is more sombre when reminded that a few Northampton \"doves\" have threatened to return their season-tickets this Saturday when he makes his debut at home to Bath. \"I'm expecting a lot of stick - and rightfully so. I made a lot of mistakes while playing for the Springboks in England and I'm ready for abuse from rival clubs. But I'm determined to win over every Saints fan. I'm ready to get stuck in and bleed for their cause.\" </p> <p>Krige has an endearing, if unfortunate, tendency to use the stirring language of battle even when promising to play clean and positive rugby. A desire to \"get stuck in\" and to bleed the green, black and yellow blood of Northampton inadvertently confirms his gruesome image. And yet, off the field, Krige is so charming and sincere that it is hard not to hope the Bogyman has been laid to rest forever. </p> <p>\"Part of the problem is that I'm not as big as most of these guys. I make up for it in aggression and play borderline rugby. Over the course of 40 games a season sometimes I step over that line. So it's inevitable there are a lot of reservations about me. People here have seen me on television in one game and they assume I'm always like that. So I'm not offended at comparisons with Freddie Kruger or even Bin Laden. I take that in the joking spirit it's meant. But I'm determined to change these preconceived ideas about me.\" </p> <p>His notoriety stems from November 2002 - when the Springboks lashed out savagely while losing 53-3 to England at Twickenham. Krige led the carnage as he attempted to smash his forearm into Matt Dawson - only to concuss his own team-mate, Andre Pretorious, by mistake. He then sank a knee into Lawrence Dallaglio, stamped on Phil Vickery and elbowed Jason Robinson in the face. </p> <p>\"I stepped totally out of line and I've got to take the criticism on the chin. People make mistakes in pressurised situations and that's what happened to me. My team was in dire straits and I allowed myself to be pushed into the wrong decisions.\" </p> <p>Krige is equally candid when asked whether his violence was premeditated. \"I have to admit that. We had just lost to France and Scotland so we knew there was no way we were going to beat England. We went out there to ruffle them up and get among them physically. One of my players got a red card early and things spiralled out of control. A lot of my guys gave up but I was determined to go down fighting. It was wrong but we were such a poor team there seemed no alternative. Half of that Springbok side never came close to playing Test rugby again. </p> <p>\"It's ironic that when England took a weakened team to New Zealand this year they also got a player [Simon Shaw] sent off early and were beaten badly. Maybe they now appreciate what we were up against. At Northampton it'll be interesting to talk to Ben Cohen and Steve Thompson and get their perspective as England players. I've obviously seen them since arriving and things seem fine - but I know England players at other clubs might hold a grudge against me.\" </p> <p>That animosity is most obvious in the case of Dawson - who has just left Northampton for Wasps. In his deliberately provocative autobiography, the England scrum-half ridiculed Krige as South Africa's \"thug-in-chief\". </p> <p>\"Matt Dawson is quite outspoken,\" Krige says dryly, \"but I still felt honoured to get a mention in his book. I've heard the rumours that Dawson left Northampton because of me - but I think it was more a contractual situation between him and the club. I would definitely have come to Saints even if Dawson had stayed. If we'd played together and got to know each other over a few beers, then maybe we would've both changed our attitude. </p> <p>\"I'm more encouraged by Martin Johnson. I said some things about him [Krige described Johnson as the dirtiest captain in Test rugby] but we sorted it out, face to face, and he doesn't bear any grudges. There's real quality to his character. And of course he understands rugby and I think he knows Twickenham was a one-off situation.\" </p> <p>Krige has both the eloquence and the determination to become a little more saintly. It is also conceivable that, away from the trials of Test rugby, he could emerge as one of the most commanding players in this season's Premiership. In the process he will provide a personal reminder that, despite England's World Cup win, the southern hemisphere countries are burning to regain their traditional domination of world rugby. </p> <p>\"I think one of the reasons England have been so successful in recent years is down to the quality of the Premiership. It's intensely competitive and provided the basis of a very good English World Cup-winning side. But sport moves in cycles and England, without Johnson and Jonny Wilkinson, look much more vulnerable. Even with Wilkinson back, they might still struggle a little. The All Blacks and Springboks have taken big strides forward. I think that, at the moment, England are only somewhere in the top four. I'd probably pick New Zealand as the world's best team - just - but the Boks are now right behind them.\" </p> <p>The painful irony for Krige is that South Africa, under new coach Jake White, are now a far happier and more fluid team - and beat New Zealand and Australia this month while winning their first Tri-Nations in six years. </p> <p>\"When I heard about Jake's appointment I couldn't believe it. I thought we'd hit a new low. I just didn't see him as an international coach - but I was very wrong. He's done an amazing job in revitalising Springbok rugby.\" </p> <p>Krige admits to recently \"being really emotional and wondering if I had done the right thing in quitting Test rugby. I was still only 28 when I stood down this year. That's quite young in an English context but I'd just had enough. The constant criticism was not only wearing me down. It was affecting my wife, Justine, and that's when it was time to get out. </p> <p>\"I was unlucky to fall between two eras. I played a little for Nick Mallett who was a sophisticated coach, and the Springboks are now starting to regain some of those same qualities. But I won the bulk of my 39 caps under a much more conservative regime during one of the worst slumps in South African rugby. As captain I was under enormous emotional and psychological strain. When you lead the Springboks and things go well then it's wonderful. But when things go badly the bitterness is almost unprecedented. The only other comparison is with the All Blacks. But New Zealanders tell me they can't believe the negativity and anger we face in South Africa.\" </p> <p>That grim era was encapsulated by the Springboks' preparations for last year's World Cup. Deep in the bush, at \"Camp Barbwire\", players were ritually humiliated and stripped naked at gunpoint. \"That camp only lasted three days - but they were the longest three days of my life. The worst moment was when all the players were thrown into a dark pit. They poured ice-cold water over us and played the British and New Zealand anthems. It was very demoralising as they tried to break us down.\" </p> <p>As part of Krige's cathartic attempt to confront his demons, he admits to his own culpability in that grotesque exercise. \"I regret not challenging our coach [Rudolf Straeuli]. Before the World Cup he came to me, Joost [van der Westhuizen] and John Smit [the new Springbok captain]. Straeuli said he was thinking about running a military camp before we went to Australia but wanted our input. And we, rather naively, said, 'Sure, why not?' It seemed a good idea to get away from the press and go out into the bush. It turned out to be a huge mistake. </p> <p>\"It was classic military intimidation. I remember one point when, as captain, I decided enough was enough. We had been made to stand naked in cold water for so long that a lot of the guys were suffering from hypothermia. I led the team out of the water. But the camp was being run by these guys from the Special Forces who drove us back into the water. We had been told beforehand that anyone who didn't survive the camp would not make it to the World Cup. So we gave in. But it would be wrong to use that as an excuse and say that's why we lost to England and New Zealand in the World Cup.\" </p> <p>After the insanity of Camp Barbwire it's easy to understand why Krige can look forward to the spleen of Welford Road or Kingsholm with equanimity. </p> <p>\"You know what they say about tough times. If you survive them they make you a stronger and better person. I've come out of a long tunnel and it's time to start a new life. I've not just been through all this shit to now roll over. I'm determined to make a new reputation in the northern hemisphere.\" </p> <p>He may never become Saint Corne, but Krige will play for Northampton with a yearning for redemption. He points again to the website clipping which imagined him forming a terrifying backrow with Kruger and Bin Laden. </p> <p>\"I read that whole piece and, in the end, the guy starts talking about his own kids. Me and Justine are about to have our first baby in February. So I lingered over those last lines where this ordinary Northampton supporter writes that he wants his kids to grow up 'brave and tough and decent and fair'. And his last line is that he wants me to become their benchmark. That's very humbling. The guy is reserving judgment on me. He's giving me a chance to show that I'm not the person he once imagined. That's a wonderful opportunity for me. I intend to take it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Coaching England can be a bitch of a job even if your PA is the soul of discretion. Apparently there is no truth in the rumour that Faria Alam has emailed her CV to Sir Clive Woodward - \"I have some expertise in handling powerful men . . .\" - but hiring the Football Association's nemesis might not be a bad move. There is nothing like a femme fatale in the next-door office to distract attention from your own problematic in-tray. </p> <p>Because, for once, the looming rugby union season finds Woodward looking to restore his reputation as a sporting alchemist. Maybe that explains his presence alongside the Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, persuading even Gary Lineker to link him with an imminent future in football management. </p> <p>Either way, if England lose their autumn Tests at Twickenham Woodward may find even his national football and cricket counterparts Sven-Goran Eriksson and Duncan Fletcher overtaking him in the popularity stakes. Eriksson has not had an easy summer, granted, but the World Cup qualifiers may boost his professional credentials and his players still rate him. Everyone else wants to have a drink with their clever new mate Fletcher, the quiet animator behind England's cricketing rejuvenation. For Sir Woody, however, the World Cup sequel is proving infinitely trickier to direct than the classic original. </p> <p>It is not simply a case of refreshing England's tactics after their dire summer tour of New Zealand and Australia where they lost heavily in all three Tests and conceded 14 tries to two. Neither is it primarily about picking up the physical pieces of still-injured squad members. Instead, if the stage whispers coming from the clubs are correct, the England management must recapture their players' hearts and minds before they can hope to recreate the sunlit joys of last autumn. </p> <p>Prominent names at three Zurich Premiership clubs have told me that a number of England players now feel they are receiving better specialist, nitty-gritty coaching and individual attention at their clubs than at international level. Senior players have apparently given the management a list of improvements they feel need to be made. The idle barbecue banter about English player disenchantment that got Wasps' director of rugby Warren Gatland into trouble over the summer has become a recurring theme. Gatland had a meeting with Andy Robinson as recently as last week at which he pleaded for better communication between the England management and their club counterparts. </p> <p>All this is relative, of course; England have the World Cup safely tucked away and autumn Tests against Canada, South Africa and Australia are still two months away. No one is suggesting Robinson, Phil Larder and Woodward have become bad coaches overnight, nor that England have become complacent. But is it just possible Woodward's modus operandi is being overtaken not only abroad but at home as well? Are his players growing weary of listening to voices they first heard, in some cases, seven years ago? </p> <p>Even two years ago such a notion would have been preposterous. Given Woodward is about to publish a book entitled 'Winning!', which celebrates his management philosophies, neither is this the ideal time for such conjecture. The tome, by the way, is full of anecdotes about the lengths to which he has gone to give England an edge, including taking a ride in an Israeli army jet over the Golan Heights with a specialist in sight-testing. Eriksson's penchant for dishwasher-loading before sex rather suffers by comparison, doesn't it? </p> <p>But, increasingly, the most successful coach in English rugby history seems to be being hoist by his own Nike-sponsored, much-admired petard. By issuing his players with laptops, putting them in control of on-field decision-making and turning every one of them into diet-obsessed fitness fiends, Woodward unwittingly created a bunch of potential Frankensteins who increasingly believe they know as much about the world of elite performance as he does. The management have always sought players with good rugby brains; maybe it was only a matter of time before the squad got their heads together and queried the chemistry of Team England. </p> <p>Woodward himself must be starting to feel a little like Sir Richard Branson whenever the latter boards a Virgin train. As a \"big picture\" man, he is a believer in delegating to loyal specialists whose input keeps the chariot rolling but, of late, the conveyor belt has seized up. Will Greenwood suggests England's spluttering backline simply needs a squirt of WD40, yet rarely in international sport are flaws eradicated quite so easily. </p> <p>To complicate life further, two-thirds of Premiership sides also possess a shrewd, no-nonsense, non-English director of rugby or coach; if things get bumpy this autumn, not all of them will be shedding patriotic tears of sorrow on Woodward's behalf. Neither will South Africa's Jake White nor Australia's Eddie Jones when their teams visit Twickenham. And to cap it all, what about Woodward's Lions tour to New Zealand next summer? </p> <p>You could pick a decent Lions Test XV containing up to a dozen Celts, as follows: Murphy; S Williams, O'Driscoll, D'Arcy, Robinson; Wilkinson, Cooper; Smith, Bulloch, Vickery, O'Connell, O'Callaghan, Easterby, O'Connor, Taylor. If the head coach picks a whole load of Englishmen and the series is lost, he really will cop some stick. If, conversely, he declines to pick his World Cup heroes and the Lions lose, things could get even nastier. As Paula Radcliffe now knows, there are some fickle people out there.</p>",
  "<p>Racing at Spa is tricky enough in the dry but every conceivable obstacle was put in the way of the teams yesterday as drizzle and the occasional bout of rain visited this corner of the Ardennes during qualifying for today's Belgian Grand Prix. </p> <p>Jarno Trulli and the Renault team may have read the changeable conditions and used their luck to the full when claiming pole but, typically, Michael Schumacher produced another extraordinary performance to grab second fastest time when the track was at its most treacherous. </p> <p>With Friday's practice taking place in the dry, the last thing the teams needed was for mist and poor visibility to cause the cancellation of most of yesterday's free practice. The scheduled hour and half was reduced to 15 minutes and even that was cut by a couple of minutes when two cars spun off. </p> <p>Drivers then had a single lap of pre-qualifying in which to determine the latest conditions before setting up their cars for the real thing, the guesswork made more difficult by the rule that says cars must be qualified in the condition in which they will start the grand prix. With the forecast predicting a dry race, the dilemma was obvious: do you set up the car for optimum performance in the wet and qualify well, or choose to think about the race and let qualifying suffer accordingly? The answer was the latter, although the very tricky conditions prompted a lean towards compromise. </p> <p>Then there was the question of which type of tyre to use. A deep-grooved tread was essential for cutting through the many areas of standing water as the surrounding slopes disgorged the effect of incessant rain. But halfway through, the rain stopped long enough to allow the track to begin to dry by significant amounts in several places. </p> <p>Trulli was the first beneficiary, followed by his team-mate Fernando Alonso, Renault making the most of their good fortune by using an intermediate tyre that has shallower grooves but offers more grip. It was a gamble because there was no opportunity to try the intermediates at any time during the weekend but Trulli's time, two seconds better than anyone at that point, proved the risk was worthwhile. </p> <p>Alonso and David Coulthard (McLaren-Mercedes) followed suit with second and third fastest times. Juan Pablo Montoya then tried intermediates on his Williams-BMW but the rain returned and the Columbian was three seconds slower as he struggled for grip. </p> <p>Finally it seemed that Schumacher, due to run last, would find a front-row starting position beyond his reach. But that was to discount the Ferrari driver's exceptional car control as he split the Renaults despite running wide at the final corner. </p> <p>Rain has been a part of racing at Spa ever since its first grand prix in 1925. One of the best-documented wet races occurred in 1966 when F1 used the original eight-mile version of the current track. </p> <p>That field rushed headlong into a downpour at Burnenville, located on the far side of a hill and three miles from the bone-dry starting grid. Cameras recording footage for the film <em> Grand Prix</em> captured the appalling conditions as several cars crashed. Jackie Stewart's career almost ended before it had begun when he landed upside down in a ditch and was trapped in a buckled BRM that was leaking fuel. </p> <p>A sister car of that BRM P261 will be running at the Goodwood Revival next weekend when, among many famous names, Sir Stirling Moss will be enjoying a superbly crafted re-creation of racing in the 1950s and early 60s at the Sussex circuit. </p> <p>It is one of the ironies of Moss's brilliant career that he never won at Spa, a drivers' circuit if ever there was one. Moss's memories of Spa are clouded by accidents, most notably in 1960 when a rear wheel parted company with his Lotus on the fast, downhill approach to Burnenville and put the Englishman in hospital with a broken nose, vertebra and two fractured legs. </p> <p>It could have been worse, given the frequency of accidents and the cavalier approach to safety at the time: on the same weekend two young British drivers, Alan Stacey and Chris Bristow, were killed as the original road circuit provided a terrible reminder of its inherent perils. </p> <p>The revised circuit, introduced in 1983 and using much of the original, managed to keep the character of the old while incorporating the necessary safety standards. The challenge remains and there can be no better setting for Schumacher to score enough points to clinch his seventh world championship in whatever weather Spa has to offer. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>To complete a triumphant summer England must transform their performances in one-day cricket. On the horizon are three matches against India, the first of which is on Wednesday at Trent Bridge. Then they embark on the Champions Trophy, a helter-skelter competition involving all the Test nations. This tournament would be all the more spectacular if it weren't taking place at the fag end of the season when the leaves are falling and the in-growing toenails of footballers are prone to dominate the back pages. </p> <p>England's success at Test level in recent months has tended to mask their continued underachievement in one-day cricket. Remember how they failed to make the final of the triangular series earlier this summer. Brian Lara's West Indians were a more potent outfit than Michael Vaughan's England. </p> <p>The change in personnel between England's Test team and their one-day side remains a problem. The overhaul is uncomfortably large. The most puzzling omission this time around is that of Matthew Hoggard, an integral member of the Test team, who prides himself on his control but who is now regarded as a Test match specialist. </p> <p>There are six players in the squad, who did not appear in the Test matches this summer - Gareth Batty, Anthony McGrath, Darren Gough, Paul Collingwood, Vikram Solanki and Alex Wharf, who has been drafted into the squad for the injured Kabir Ali. </p> <p>Of these Solanki is probably in the last-chance saloon. He has flickered at this level, hitting one memorable century at The Oval before enduring a miserable winter tour. His strokeplay can mesmerise and infuriate in equal measure. His presence will enhance the fielding but this will be his third - and presumably last - attempt to establish himself in the team. Wharf, a no-nonsense all-rounder, has advanced on the back of Glamorgan's excellent performances in domestic cricket. </p> <p>Gough and Collingwood have little to prove. Gough takes on the unlikely role of the father figure, now relying on his experience rather than his explosiveness. It beggars belief that he will still be around when the World Cup starts in 2007. </p> <p>Collingwood is in clover. Despite a sketchy season, disrupted by injury, he has won a place in the Test squad for South Africa as a utility man - he can bat, bowl (a bit), is a fine substitute fielder and is a cheerful purveyor of drinks. However he no longer has the luxury of a 12-month central contract. Meanwhile it is difficult to see how Batty and McGrath can get into the best side. </p> <p>The Indian think-tank is more likely to focus on how to deal with Andrew Flintoff, Marcus Trescothick and Steve Harmison. As for England they only have to worry about Sehwag, Ganguly, Dravid Laxman, Tendulkar.... </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Chic came from last to first under Kieren Fallon to snatch a thrilling Celebration Mile by a length-and-a-quarter from 5-4 favourite Nayyir and Mick Kinane. It prompted Fallon to indulge in an uncharacteristic flourish of the whip as he crossed the line on the Cheveley Park Stud filly. </p> <p>Fallon came in for some criticism at the Glorious Goodwood meeting when he did not shine on some of his rides, including the Sir Michael Stoute-trained Chic in the Oak Tree Stakes, and this success clearly gave him immense pleasure. </p> <p>It was a win born of a suicidal gallop set by the seven-furlong specialist Naahy and last year's runner-up Passing Glance. Naahy tanked off under Johnny Murtagh but Martin Dwyer drove Passing Glance up on his outside entering the home straight as though his life depended upon snatching the favoured stands' rail. He managed to succeed in this battle but the war was soon over for Passing Glance as Nayyir was ridden past him a furlong-and-a-half out. </p> <p>Despite carrying his head at an ungainly angle - he wears a crossed noseband - Nayyir was soon in command while Chic, sent off at 4-1, was struggling in last place against the rail. 'They went too fast to stay,' Fallon said. 'But my horse couldn't go the pace anyway.' But she did stay all right. </p> <p>For, just when it looked as though Nayyir had the race in the bag, the picture changed and Chic began to pick up those weakening. With Fallon at his strongest, she swept past the 5-4 favourite for a victory that maintains Cheveley Park's extraordinary run of recent successes, including Orange Touch in the Listed March Stakes here and Echelon in the opening maiden at Newmarket. Chic's win left them two short of 50 victories for the season and the Stud's managing director, Chris Richardson, was positively beaming. </p> <p>Their other crack filly in training with Stoute, Russian Rhythm, won the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury in May before meeting with a setback. She may not be ready in time for the Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket in October, so now it seems likely that Chic will take her place in the race alongside Sussex Stakes winner Soviet Song and, possibly, Attraction. </p> <p>That will be Chic's first attempt at a Group One and she certainly deserves the chance. Fallon insists that 'she works like a Group One filly' and from a form point of view - Soviet Song beat Nayyir in the Sussex - she is plainly of that class. </p> <p>That said, it is hard to envisage Chic having another race run to suit her so ideally. Soviet Song can quicken when asked, whereas yesterday's evidence suggests Chic needs the strongest of gallops to bring her staying power into play. If Attraction is in the field, then she should have the race run to suit but it can never be guaranteed. </p> <p>For Nayyir's trainer, Gerard Butler, it was not a happy occasion. He looked crestfallen after Nayyir's eclipse. 'I don't know what to say after that,' he said as he left the track for the evening meeting at Windsor. 'Last night I had a sleepless night for the first time in ages. I'm off to Windsor. It's back to bread and butter.' </p> <p>Butler should not allow himself to lose too much sleep over Nayyir's failure to win this race, although, with the benefit of hindsight, perhaps Kinane did not need to gun for home quite so soon and perhaps Nayyir does not stay a mile quite as well as Chic. </p> <p>Beating Butler to the car park, also on the way to Windsor, was Fallon, whose brushes with authority over the years and occasionally frosty demeanour cannot disguise his immense talent. He does not currently appear keen to say much in public although he managed to squeeze out a few words for the benefit of television viewers in the aftermath of the race. That wave of the whip on crossing the line was enough to tell us how he felt.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Many British Airways customers may be seething over delays in flights last week, the result of staff shortages. You are more likely to get the option of a refund if British Airways cancels its flights than if planes are held up by bad weather. With Heathrow airport currently experiencing its busiest weekend of the year, BA explained its refund policy to Cash. When a flight cancellation is the fault of BA (as happened when staff shortages resulted in cancellations), the airline offers travellers choice of 'the three Rs' - a full refund, rerouting (where passengers opt for a different destination) or rescheduling to the next available flight (on BA or another carrier). Vouchers will be issued for food and refreshments and for a hotel room if an overnight stay is required. People who have additional claims (such as further transport costs) can raise this issue with the customer relations department (0870 850 9850) and are more likely to be successful in their claim if they have receipts. </p> <p>However, if the cause of the disrupted travel is outside BA's control, then the company's policy is to reschedule. So if bad weather causes delays, BA will aim to get passengers on to the next available flight. </p> <p>If, as had seemed possible, strike action prevents flights taking off, passengers will be contacted and warned. 'We would make preparations for that,' a spokesman says. These passengers would also be offered the choice of the three Rs. </p> <p>Travellers might be able to claim on their insurance policies, but Greg Lynott, director of financial services at Asda, says: 'Many holidaymakers don't realise that some policies don't cover them for delayed departures. People travelling this weekend should take a close look at their policy to see if they're covered for delays and cancellation.'</p>",
  "<p>It has been perversely comforting to witness over the past 16 days how athletes and the rest of us have changed little, for better or worse, since the Olympics were revived here 104 years ago. </p> <p>Comforting inasmuch as the good and the bad on show in Athens have again put a hole in the logic of those who say the Olympics are dead. It is, in fact, the unkillable beast. </p> <p>The modern Olympics only just made it out of the womb in 1896, beset by politicking and mismanagement, and, having grown like an unruly child in 24 incarnations since, it is now what might be described as a mature if confused adult. </p> <p>These Games have been very good, a lot better than the career cynics predicted, certainly from a British perspective, and internationally as well. The infrastructure has worked fine, the crowds, disappointing at first, have picked up and the city, although emptied of half its citizens, has embraced visitors with as much enthusiasm as you could expect from hosts lumbered with this strange invention of Victorian elitists called Olympianism. </p> <p>Just as it eventually overcame the hypocritical absurdity of amateurism, so the movement seems strong enough to withstand the shenanigans that will attend any carnival of sport, especially one that lasts nearly three weeks and brings together more than 10,000 athletes and the world's media. </p> <p>Certainly the International Olympic Committee have to address the problem of 'gigantism'. It capped numbers and events here to just-manageable proportions, but there will be pressure to make the Beijing Games in 2008 an even bigger showpiece for that fast-growing power's commercial potential. Alongside the octopus that is drugs, the IOC's main challenge remains combating the corruption that accompanies the spread of its empire. </p> <p>For all that, essentially the Olympics are still about the athletes. And, as ever, they have the ability to surprise and disappoint us in many different ways. It is not all about perfection. The best moments are often the most contradictory. </p> <p>In 1896, the Greek shepherd Spyridon Louis declared how the night before he won the first marathon he'd been plied with wine by his hosts - and then happily called for more, as well as taking 'a beaker of wine and an Easter egg' from his future father-in-law during the the race. </p> <p>Last Thursday, Ryan Barley, a grungy heavy-metal addict who trains on hamburgers and who had 'a bit of a late one' the night before the last cycling event, the Keirin, went out and won his second gold medal going away. </p> <p>'I hit the gas and it just went boom,' said the 22-year-old Australian. As Spyridon's father-in-law conspired in his excesses, so Ryan's girlfriend, a vegetarian, has apparently been won around to his no-worries ways. A victory for the common man, albeit in both instances exceptional ones. </p> <p>There has been other evidence of all the recurring themes of humanity, of course, not all of it palatable. </p> <p>Where the drug of choice in the early days was strychnine, here the cheats have been floating on nandrolone and other juice. Of course, the accused are rarely guilty in their own eyes. 'I'm not going to give the gold medal back because I'm not guilty of anything,' said the Russian shot-putter Irina Korzhanenko, who failed a drugs test after winning her event when the Olympics made an emotional return to its birthplace, Olympia. She could not have spoiled the party more thoroughly had she taken a machine gun to the ancient ruins. </p> <p>Others caught have been similarly stubborn, including Kostas Kederis and Ekaterini Thanou. They are sticking to their original story in the face of mounting evidence that the motorcycle crash that kept them out of the reach of the investigators in the first week was, at best, not exactly a Superbike pile-up. Already one corroborating witness has been jailed for an unrelated fraud. Their five days in hospital with mere scratches adds to the suspicion that others have colluded in their defence. This story is far from over. </p> <p>Interestingly, though, their compatriots on Thursday night screamed their support for Kederis, disrupting the start of the 200metres final in which he might have been a medallist. It supports a remark I made to a British colleague last week, one he was reluctant to accept: for all the venality of drugs use, most people are past caring. </p> <p>Unlike journalists, for whom these transgressions are the bread and butter of the business, they have been brutalised by the unending busts, merely waiting for the next one rather than agonising over the rights and wrongs of the matter. </p> <p>That is sad, naturally. But it is only a minor part of a bigger and happier story. There are so many incredible individuals here, athletes of such differing disciplines and diverse backgrounds who sacrifice time and effort to be part of it. You would have to be a wizened old prune not to revel in their attendance. </p> <p>Kim Gevaert, for instance. She is a Belgium sprinter who gave up a career as a classical pianist to try for the Olympics. </p> <p>Or Jefferson Perez from Ecuador, whose participation in the 50k walk is sustained by a lifetime supply of yoghurt donated by a patriotic company after he'd won the event in Sydney. </p> <p>British eyes, inevitably, are trained on British competitors but, if you managed to avert your gaze from Paula Radcliffe's sad exit from the marathon last week, you will have seen the equally reed-like American Deena Kastor hang on for bronze. Imaginatively (or just plain idiotically), her training partner is a chocolate labrador called Aspen. And, as they say, every dog has its day. </p> <p>As for 'Our Paula', she turned into the one-girl reality TV nightmare of the Olympics. But even two months in the Big Brother house could not provide such gruesome, microscopic examination of her psyche by the nation - not to mention that of a couple of paid critics, whose insensitivity was staggering even by Fleet Street standards. </p> <p>What must she have made of the judgment of one writer who said she should have 'crawled into the Panathinaiko Stadium on hands and knees'? There was even a crude allusion to the death of Pheidippides, who sacrificed his life in the mythic run from Marathon to Athens. These modern Olympics demand sacrifice and commitment, not death and humiliation. </p> <p>When she pulled up in the 10,000metres on Friday night the analysis continued. She smiled for the BBC, then cried when led away into the tunnel. All we do know is this is a troubled athlete, physically and mentally. After all she has achieved, she should be allowed the dignity of suffering in private. Fat chance. </p> <p>All that said, rancour forgotten and hope intact, the Games rumble on. It can be a tatty old show, far from perfect, yet capable of providing sublime memories. It is the most human of all sporting endeavours and we are all the better for having the privilege of watching. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>I hadn't been to Paxos for 15 years when I decided to go back with my friend Valerie for a week's gossip and flop holiday. 'What on earth are you going to do?' asked my husband. 'There's nothing there. It's so small that you could almost walk round it in a day, and there's no shopping.' </p> <p>After reminding him that we weren't a couple of airheads who needed a regular retail fix, I told him we wanted somewhere laid-back, quiet and charming where we felt completely relaxed. If we'd been a couple of Shirley Valentines, we'd have gone for somewhere livelier. We wanted to walk, drink wine, eat olives, read, swim and stroll leisurely into town for dinner. </p> <p>In truth I was looking for my own personal romantic ideal of Greece - the one I'd first visited in the Seventies. I wanted simple rickety tavernas, thyme-scented mule tracks, scuttling black widows and a photogenic fisherman mending his nets on the quayside. I dismissed villas with pools as far too decadent. Isn't Greece about blinding white pebble beaches and launching your self off rocks into a surreally blue sea? </p> <p>Circling above Corfu for an hour in a thunderstorm got us off to a bad-tempered start, but after a smooth two-hour ferry crossing we reached Gaios, the Paxiot capital and home for the next week, in hazy sunshine. We were met with a cheerful typically Greek bustle on the harbour and bundled into one of the island's five taxis for Eliot Villa. </p> <p>It was everything I hoped it would be - simple, private and set high enough back off the road to have a view through the branches of a giant olive tree across to the mountainous Greek mainland. Further down the terrace we could sit and look out on tiny Saint Nicholas island, complete with white-washed monastery, terracotta roof and splashes of cobalt - the quintessential colours of Greece. </p> <p>That night we plunged into the back streets of Gaios, found a restaurant owned by 'a nice English couple', both chose the paella and ate to a background of Bob Marley's greatest hits. All very enjoyable for less than \u00a330 for two with a bottle of red, but not very Greek. </p> <p>Next day we woke to grey skies, no water and no sense of humour. Well, I wanted basic Greece. I'd got it. Still, this is the land of myth and legend. Paxos is said to have risen from the Ionian sea at the command of Poseidon, who used it as a secret love nest. One rather frosty command from me to the office of our tour operator, Greek Islands Club, and the water miraculously spluttered back on. </p> <p>As we walked into town for provisions, the sky cleared, the mountain outline sharpened and a tiddly blue and orange fishing caique with yellow buoys and curled nets, like something out of a child's painting, chugged past. The shops, bursting with sun-ripened veggies and fruit, were far better stocked than I'd remembered, and there were more cafes pandering to the appetites of visiting Italians. But who could complain about a decent mid-morning cappuccino? </p> <p>Apart from a few more expensive harbourside jewellery shops to catch the passing yachties, and much improved gift shops selling stylish straw bags, belts, bracelets (think Accessorize, but even cheaper) and kaftans by the score, brilliant for middle-aged thighs, Gaios had hardly changed. </p> <p>We spent idle days shopping (mainly for kaftans) and strolling, enjoying sunny salad lunches on the terrace, dipping our bread into the deliciously grassy local olive oil. Paxos has a population of around 2,200 and allegedly 200,000 olive trees. Apparently, profit from the yummy oil still outstrips the money made from tourism. </p> <p>On one of the sunnier days we caught the boat to Antipaxos with just two tavernas on a gem of a golden sand beach. At one of them a harassed youth served grilled fish to 60 with smiling apologies for his slow service and told us he was too busy to charge any more than last year's prices. 'People are charging more because of the Olympics,' he said. 'We are a family business and we want to make money, but we want you to come back, and we want you to be happy.' </p> <p>Back in Gaios, the shops and tavernas seemed curiously quiet. Going determinedly Greek that night with souvlaki (pork kebab) and chips in one of the cheaper cafes surrounding the main square, we got chatting to an English couple having a night off from running their taverna in one of the central island villages. They told us they faced financial ruin because they're not getting the same levels of business as before. </p> <p>'This year people are just not coming and we are hanging on by the skin of our teeth. We blame the Olympics, the Athens bombings, or probably just fashion. This year everyone seems to be deserting Greece for Croatia.' </p> <p>It's a shame, if true, because Paxos is still immensely pretty, and apart from a spate of smart villa building, it truly hasn't changed. Taking a right from Eliot Villa to the tiny resort of Moggonissi took us past snaking dry stone walls and ancient basilicas tethered to the ground by tangled weeds. Bright yellow and burnt orange butterflies followed us through olive groves where black nets lay in neat piles, ready to roll to catch the autumn harvest. </p> <p>The following day we walked the 10-mile round trip to Loggos, a brochure-cover fishing village, accompanied all the way by a friendly mongrel. On the way we passed tiny stone churches with artfully weathered bell towers, giant plane trees and wildflower meadows thick with poppies, daisies, pimpernel and campion. When no one was around we snacked on oranges and mulberries from well-tended gardens with geraniums as big as saucers. </p> <p>Sipping fresh peach juice in a Loggos taverna, waiting for our calamari to cook for lunch, Valerie and I pondered the eternal Greek questions, such as why does a nation who gave us ancient wisdom and philosophy have such terrible plumbing? Or why do people use worry beads in a place where no one looks the slightest bit stressed? </p> <p>As we sat watching the fishermen mend their nets, we agreed that Paxos is as perfect for a relaxed holiday as a Greek island ever gets. It doesn't need the glitzy tourist trappings of five-star hotels, spas and dressed-up bars. </p> <p><strong>Factfile</strong></p> <p>Jill Hartley travelled to Paxos with Greek Islands Club (020 8232 9780; <a href=\"http://www.greekislandsclub.com\">www.greekislandsclub.com</a>).

  "<p>A major loophole in travel protection for consumers has been exposed following the collapse of UK tour operator Travelscene. </p> <p>Thousands of holidaymakers who booked accommodation only with the company have been left without any compensation because only those who bought flight-inclusive packages were protected. </p> <p>Under current legislation, when a travel agent or tour operator sells a package they have to put up a bond to protect their customer, but if they sell each component separately, they do not. </p> <p>'This is so complicated that even the industry itself does not fully understand,' explained Noel Josephides, council member of the Association of Independent Tour Operators. 'Travel agents and the public have been booking, thinking they are covered, but they are not. Half of the industry is regulated to the hilt and the other half can do what it likes. The travel industry has changed and we've been lobbying the government for a long time to bring the legislation in line.' </p> <p>Aito chairman Martin Garland said: 'It is a very serious problem and it is the same issue with no-frills airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair selling unbonded accommodation on their websites. It seems as if the Government is content to wait until British consumers are stranded overseas and lose their money before it does anything.' </p> <p>The confusion has been compounded because many of the new accommodation-only companies have been set up by well-established tour operators such as Travelscene, that have traditionally sold packages. </p> <p>These include Thomas Cook, which launched its <a href=\"http://www.roomsandhotels.com\">roomsandhotels.com</a> accommodation-only agency in June. A spokeswoman said that although accommodation sold through roomsandhotels.com was not bonded, Thomas Cook pledged to give these customers the same protection as if they booked a package. </p> <p>Customers who book through these accommodation-only agents may also face problems if they have a complaint about the standards of their hotel because rather than entering into a contract with the agent they are actually entering into a legal agreement directly with the overseas hotel.</p>",
  "<p>South Korea's Tae Young Yang has filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport challenging the result of the men's all-round gymnastics final. </p> <p>Yang controversially lost out to USA's Paul Hamm because of a judging error in marking down the degree of difficulty on the parallel bars exercise. </p> <p>The International Gymnastic Federation (FIG) have pleaded with Hamm to hand the medal back as a gesture of fair play.

  "<p>Britain's Amir Khan has failed in his attempt to become the youngest Olympic boxing champion since American Floyd Patterson in Helsinki in 1952, losing to Cuban maestro Mario Cesar Kindelan Mesa 30-22 in the lightweight (57-60kg) division final today.</p> <p>Like his hero, Mohammed Ali, Khan floated like a butterfly, and he tried his best to sting like a bee. However, like a bee, his stings became his own undoing as he was picked off time and again by Kindelan's fierce counter swats.</p> <p>Khan led 4-3 after the first round, but the defending champion then found his range to take a 14-9 lead at the half way stage. </p> <p>One round later Khan was 22-14 down, but even then the young man from Bolton did not give up and landed a number of good punches in an even final round. </p> <p>33-year-old Kindelan, perhaps the greatest of a long line of great Cuban amateur boxers, had not been beaten in any competition since 1999, winning three world titles in that time. He also won gold in the lightweight division in Sydney. He now retires undefeated.</p> <p>\"He's the best boxer I've seen in a long time,\" Khan told the BBC afterwards. \"It's a shame I didn't beat him, but I tried my best and I thought I did well. It could have gone either way, but I don't control the judges.</p> <p>\"I was very calm because I was up against the Olympic champion; I had nothing to lose. I think I did Britain proud. I'm confident I can take the gold in Beijing.\"</p> <p>Whether Khan actually gets the chance to fulfil that prophecy is open to question as the boxing promoters circle around him, offering him huge rewards to turn professional immediately.</p> <p>Kindelan's victory took Cuba's tally of boxing golds in Athens to a remarkable five.</p> <p>Earlier, Yan Bhartelemy Varela beat another 17-year-old, Atagun Yalcinkaya of Turkey, in the light flyweight division (under 48kg) by 21 points to 16.</p> <p>Like Khan, Yalcinkaya mounted a brave challenge and led 4-2 on points after the opening round, but Bhartelemy's skills and greater experience eventually gave him control.</p> <p>Cuba then followed up with yet another gold in the bantamweight (51-54kg) division, as defending champion Guillermo Rigondeaux Ortiz outclassed his Thai challenger Worapoj Petchkoom. The Caribbean led after every round and, by the end, Petchkoom appeared to be resigned to the silver. The 23-year-old southpaw won 22-13.</p> <p>Immediately following the Khan fight, Lorenzo Aragon Armenteros failed to make it six golds for Cuba when he lost out to Kazakhstan's Bakhtiyar Artayev 36-26 in the 64-69kg division final.</p> <p>However, Cuba's golden final morning continued in the freestyle wrestling. Yandro Miguel Quintana trimphed in the men's 55-60kg division final, taking his country's gold count to nine: that same as that of Great Britain. Cuba now lies in tenth place on the medals table, one place behind Team GB.</p>",
  "<p>Keeping up with the Joneses can prove ruinously expensive, especially when it comes to regularly parking a new set of wheels in the drive. But for those who like to change their car frequently and would prefer to avoid the huge cash outlay of a brand new car - not to mention the dealer horse-trading come trade-in time - then a personal contract purchase (PCP) might be a nifty move. </p> <p>According to Sainsbury's Bank, which runs a car purchasing plan, there has been a big increase in demand for these schemes as employees turn down company cars because of high tax rates. Sainsbury's says the number of customers using its plan has trebled in two years. </p> <p>The attraction of PCPs is that the unknown risk of the future trade-in value is taken by the finance company, and that you can buy the car at the end of a contract if you wish. A personal leasing deal, in contrast, won't allow you to hang on to the vehicle once an agreement is finished, and hire-purchase deals - though they give you the right to buy come the end of the contract - tend to cost more per month because the initial deposit is often a lot lower. </p> <p>'For many people, PCP is the better deal overall in terms of flexibility,' says David Motton, editor of What Car? magazine. 'They also guarantee the trade-in value of the vehicle and some deals can give you the option of an inclusive maintenance package as well.' </p> <p>The structure of a PCP, as motor finance deals go, isn't hugely complex. For example, a buyer wanting a new \u00a315,000 car would pay a cash deposit - say 20 per cent of the value. The extra \u00a312,000 to be stumped up would then be divided into twochunks: one to be paid in monthly instalments, the other in what is called a balloon payment at the end of the plan, sometimes known as the minimum guaranteed future value (MGFV). </p> <p>On a typical \u00a315,000 new car, this might well be guaranteed to be a third of the initial cost. But, as Nigel Williams, senior planning manager at Black Horse Motor Finance, points out, this MGFV figure is only the minimum. 'In a lot of contracts, the vehicle is often worth more than the guaranteed balloon, so the customer can negotiate anywhere he wants to get the price value of his car. Let's say the guaranteed value is \u00a35,000 and he is offered \u00a36,000, then he's \u00a31,000 better off - that money is his.' </p> <p>However, also included in the PCP monthly direct debits is the interest piling up on the MGFV value you have also effectively borrowed. So, when a dealer quotes the monthly headline interest rate, make sure you get the overall rate on all the money you are borrowing, as the two sets of interest can be different (not all deals are structured this way). </p> <p>Motton then advises sticking touting the best offer about the dealers. 'Some big leasing companies have their own PCP schemes and will often have negotiated a discount on the car's list price and may well have better rates of interest on offer. Test drive the car at the dealer, then when you're ushered into the office, say that if they can't match the figures, you'll go elsewhere.' </p> <p><strong>Alternatives and tips</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Although PCPs might suit some, self-employed people wanting to change their car regularly are probably better off with a personal leasing arrangement because VAT is fully reclaimable. But it means you never end up owning the car. 'It's a bit like wearing a fur coat with no knickers,' says Cliff D'Arcy of the Motley Fool investment website <a href=\"http://www.fool.com\">www.fool.com</a>. 'It's been popular in the States, because it allows you to drive a flash car for small monthly payments. But you're just driving it for the time you pay the instalments.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Any hire-to-buy deal includes an annual mileage limit. If you exceed it, you will be penalised. Better to overestimate your annual mileage slightly if it looks unpredictable.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> PCPs can be good for ex-company car drivers who have opted out of their company car arrangements but like the idea of (optional) running cost packages being handled by a third party.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Watch out for administration fees such as option-to-purchase and initial acceptance fees - they all pile on the costs.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Check the small print. Could an agreement, for example, allow you to return the car early if your circumstances change, and what penalties might apply?</p>",
  "<p>All my shopping list says is 'something for the grill'. Followed by a scribbled note to check I have anchovies, rosemary, garlic and lemon. I don't have any particular meat or fish or vegetable in mind. All that matters are the seasonings - strong, robust, heady - that along with the smoke from the grill give food an unmistakable sense of high summer. </p> <p>I settle on a fat fillet of monkfish from Rowley Leigh's fish shop at the top of Kensington Church Street. It costs 20 quid but is meaty and spanking fresh, its pearlescent skin glistening on the ice. It will feed four of us. Although it is not on my list, I also pick up a couple of handfuls of samphire while I'm there. </p> <p>At home I cut the fish into thick chunks and toss it with lemon and olive oil, anchovies, garlic and needles of rosemary. Covered and in the fridge, it will stay happily for two or three hours without harm. On the grill I will let the edges singe so that the flavour of the smoke permeates the fish. Of course it could have been a fillet of Welsh lamb, a halved aubergine, a pile of long whiskered prawns. Smoke, garlic, lemon and salt - the tastes of August cooking. #</p> <p>I want to crank up the flavours for tonight's meal even more, so I will make a bowl of garlic mayonnaise, too, quite a pungent version made with four fat cloves of garlic to two egg yolks, a good 300ml of peppery olive oil and the juice of half a lemon to create a slovenly texture. </p> <p>I have never been convinced of the need to serve soups chilled in the summer - the exception is a good vichyssoise or a cucumber and prawn soup in shades of soft green and girlie pink. But today I want something more strident, something with long flavours. I find that if you roast tomatoes before you make them into a soup the flavour of the fruit becomes fuller and the soup takes on a more Mediterranean feel. I puree the soup, but leave a goodly amount of roasted tomatoes whole, chopping them roughly and piling them in the centre of the dish. That way the soup has body. </p> <p>Such a butch meal needs a softer ending. My plan was a tart made of greengages embedded in an almond filling, the sort you find in chi-chi pastry shops, but so meltingly ripe were the fruits that I hadn't the heart to cook them. To contrive them into a dessert would have felt like arguing with God. Instead I chilled them and presented them on a pottery platter, a leaf or two tucked artfully among them (once a food stylist, always a food stylist) and served them with shockingly cold glasses of eau de vie that had sat in the freezer for a few hours. Another meal to remember. </p> <p><strong>Roast tomato soup with basil and olive oil toasts</strong><br>Serves 4</p> <p><strong>800g deep-flavoured tomatoes<br>1 red pepper<br>2 fat cloves garlic<br>3 tbsp olive oil <br>1 litre of vegetable stock<br>a small bunch of basil<br>French bread for toasting</strong></p> <p>Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 8. Cut each tomato into six and put them in a roasting tin. Halve the pepper, pull out the seeds and white core and discard, then cut the pepper into six or so pieces and add to the tomatoes. Peel and roughly chop the garlic, add to the tomatoes then pour over the olive oil. Season generously with salt and black pepper, then roast for 45 minutes or so until the tomatoes are soft, and the skin lightly blackened in places. Make the cro\u00fbtes by slicing the bread thinly and toasting under the grill. Set aside.</p> <p>Pour the stock in the pan. Pull the basil leaves from the stems and add them to the pan, then bring briefly to the boil on the hob. Liquidise most of the mixture, pouring the liquidised soup into a bowl, leaving a couple of handfuls of tomatoes and pepper behind. Drain them of any liquid, putting it back into the soup, then chop the tomato and pepper finely. Correct the seasoning. Pile a quarter of the chopped tomato and pepper in the centre of each of four bowls, then ladle the soup around it. Float the toast on top, then drizzle with olive oil. </p> <p><strong>Grilled monkfish with rosemary</strong><br>Serves 4</p> <p><strong>800g monkfish fillet<br>3 bushy sprigs of rosemary<br>4 anchovy fillets<br>2 large or 4 small cloves of garlic<br>a large lemon<br>3 tbsp olive oil<br>a lemon to serve</strong></p> <p>Pull the leaves from the rosemary stalks and chop them finely, then tip them into a bowl large enough to take the fish. Rinse the anchovy fillets then smash them to a rough pulp with the flat edge of your chopping knife. Peel the garlic, crush it flat then smash it to a puree in the same way. Stir together the herb, anchovy and garlic, adding a grinding of black pepper and a little salt (the anchovies are quite salty). Halve the lemon, squeeze it into the other ingredients then slowly blend in the olive oil until you have a green, fragrant slush. </p> <p>If the fishmonger hasn't removed all the pearly membrane from the fish, peel it away with your fingers. It is edible, but hardly pretty after cooking. Slice the fish into two long, thick strips, then cut each one into four roughly equal pieces. </p> <p>Push the fish down into the marinade, turning them over in the oil. It will not cover them. Cover the bowl then put it in the fridge for a minimum of an hour, maximum of three. </p> <p>Get the grill hot. Lift the monkfish from the marinade and set them on the grill. They will take a good 5 minutes on each side - check it is cooked through. As the fish comes off the grill, season with more salt and a good squeeze of lemon at the table. </p> <p><strong>New potatoes with samphire</strong><br>You only need a very light dressing on this so as not to confuse the garlic mayonnaise. </p> <p><strong>650g new potatoes<br>150g samphire<br>olive oil, red wine vinegar</strong></p> <p>Scrub the potatoes. Cook them in boiling, lightly salted water (you will mix them with the samphire, which is quite salty), then drain them. Refill the pan with water, bring to the boil then add the samphire for just a minute. Toss the warm potatoes with the drained samphire, then add 2 teaspoons of red wine vinegar and 3 tablespoons olive oil. The potatoes will absorb much of the vinegar and oil.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Nature owes us no favours. A line of lettuce is fair game to slugs, snails, lettuce-root aphids, rabbits or, in my own garden this year, being ripped to bits by pheasants. It is annoying if they all take more than their fair share. But the starting point in any intelligent discussion on how to deal with so-called pests has to be one of reasonable coexistence. To blitz all other forms of life is the road to insanity ... and thoroughly bad gardening.</p> <p>The starting point is to raise healthy plants. This stunningly simple notion is one which most of the modern agricultural and horticultural world have struggled to get their collective head around for the past 50 years or so: plants that grow in a soil with good structure, nourished with garden compost made primarily from plants grown in that soil, that are not in any way forced against the weather, location or size, are in my experience remarkably trouble-free.</p> <p>The second factor, completely interconnected with healthy plants, is to encourage and sustain a balanced ecosystem. On one level this is a given. Leave your garden untouched, and a balance will establish itself with a vast range of creatures that live off and with the plants, and they'll influence the look and content of the garden. But this would not be a garden. By definition a garden is an ordered, unnatural place. One of the skills is to assimilate that tight human control into a balance with the local wildlife. It takes about three years to become harmonious, but then it is very easy to maintain. Grow as many indigenous species as possible that are part of the food chain. Make the garden a comfortable, easy place for your plants rather than indulging in an ego trip about how you manage to grow such an unlikely range of plants. </p> <p>OK. No more lecturing, I promise - although I swear there is nothing, apart from my wife and children, that I care more passionately about. So what to do about the individual creatures that are hell-bent on upsetting that precious balance? Every gardener has their current list of tormentors but here are a few of the most troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Slugs and snails</strong></p> <p>These tend to dominate the modern gardener's list of problems. The healthy plant syndrome applies also to slugs and snails, and there are many predators - from birds, hedgehogs, toads, moles and beetles - so let that predatory balance establish itself. A few comments based upon my own observations in this garden: </p> <p><strong>1</strong> Grow fairly large batches of lettuce in blocks. The lettuces grow faster than the slugs can eat them, provided that you grow them in a slug-free zone like a cold frame or greenhouse and plant them out when they are growing strongly.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Hostas are not a favourite food for slugs and snails. Grow tough-leaved types like Hosta sieboldiana and mix them with a range of other plants that will distract them.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Put your energies into the slugs that do most damage - not necessarily the biggest ones. There are four main garden slugs: the grey field slug (Derocas reticulatum), which eats anything and reproduces three generations a year; the garden slug (Arion hortensis), shiny black with an orange belly and also omnivorous, whose party trick is to eat off bean plants at ground level and riddle potatoes with holes; the keeled slug (Milax budapestensis), black with a thin orange line down its back, which spends almost all of its life underground feeding off root crops but which will also eat what it can when it surfaces; and the black slug (Arion ater), which can come in almost any colour but is differentiated from all others by its size - though, despite measuring up to 8in in length, it is the least harmful of all. Rotovate to get at the keeled slugs and handpick the field and garden slugs. Leave the poor black slug alone.</p> <p><strong>Cabbage white butterflies</strong></p> <p>This is the cabbage white season, little fluttery angels of destruction that they are. There are two types: large and small. The large white lays its eggs on the leaves of brassicas (cabbages, turnips, radishes) and the yellow-and-black caterpillars cover them by the hundred, stripping the young plants to a skeleton. The butterflies are attracted by the mustard in brassicas which the plant develops as a defence against insects. The butterflies take on the mustard taste in their own tissues, which works against predation by birds. The small white lays deeper into the plant, and its green caterpillars do their work less conspicuously but to just as noxious effect. Apparently spraying the plants with saltwater can help, but the best cure is prevention, covering the plants with a fine net from the minute they are planted until October. Otherwise you must go through each plant every day, picking off the caterpillars by hand.</p> <p><strong>Aphids</strong></p> <p>We now have an invasion of hoverflies, and their larvae eat aphids. Probably the best action you can take against aphids is to encourage ladybirds, hoverflies and lacewings into the garden by planting umbellifers like dill and fennel, or letting a patch of carrot go to seed. Tits eat huge amount of aphids, as will parasitic wasps. But one comes back to the need for healthy plants that do not have too much lush, soft growth - meat and drink to aphids. An aphid that you will not see until it is too late is lettuce-root aphid, which thrives at this time of year in very dry conditions. Lettuce will wilt a little and then suddenly collapse because the aphids feed off the roots. Lift all the affected plants and compost them and do not replant with lettuce for another year. Make sure that all unaffected lettuces are kept well watered. </p> <p><strong>Whitefly</strong></p> <p>Whitefly is primarily a pest of conservatories and greenhouses, and leaves a sticky goo that attracts sooty moulds on tomatoes, brassicas, peppers and glasshouse plants. The whitefly eggs hatch into nymphs or larvae. A minute parasitical wasp, Encarsia formosa lays its eggs inside these nymphs, and when the eggs hatch they feed off their host, killing it and hatching out from its redundant body. It can be ordered from a garden centre, will be sent to you, and must be used within 18 hours of delivery. The adults live for two weeks and should lay around 100 eggs each to carry on the good work, but they only operate in warm temperatures.</p> <p><strong>Vine weevils</strong></p> <p>These are second only to slugs and snails as horticultural hate figures, particularly to plants in containers, yet I confess that I have never even seen one. That could be because they tend to be spread in pots by plants bought from garden centres, and I very rarely buy plants this way. But they are recognisable from the beetle-like adult covered with yellow specks or the C-shaped, creamy-white larvae. The adults eat irregular holes around the edge of the leaves, but the larvae do the real damage. The adults are almost all female and will each lay more than 100 eggs in the soil around the host plant from late July. The larvae will then feed on the host's roots until spring, when they pupate. A cold winter will kill the adults. </p> <p>Pathogenic nematodes can be watered into the pots and will attack the grubs. The compost must be warm and moist, so water the plants first. Look for the adults with a torch at night and pick them off, and before buying any plant in a container, take it out of the pot and check for adults in spring and larvae in late summer. </p> <p>Sorry not to have space to mention pigeons, sawflies, weevils, thrips, suckers, leatherjackets, earwigs, wasps, moles, rabbits, voles, cats or rats.

  "<p>Summer is fading and you're now left with the fond memories of a happy, sun-soaked fortnight away from the relentless grind of everyday life - or maybe not. </p> <p>A return to the nine-to-five may be just what you need to help you get over it. That's what British holidaymakers who experienced the delights of one self-styled 'luxury' hotel in Bulgaria felt. </p> <p>So what was so bad? 'Where do you want to start?' replies Lynn, a 39-year-old from Cleveland, who with husband Andy and her two children Lauren and Lewis, have just returned from a two-week break. The hotel had been open for only a week before they arrived. 'It should never have opened at all,' she says. </p> <p>'They were putting the roof on the building throughout our stay, the plate glass doors were being fixed in the dining rooms while we were eating breakfast, the plumbing was leaking everywhere and the walls were damp. The staff were rude and the kids' club even managed to lose the children.' </p> <p>So bad was the accommodation that the tour operator offered to refund their guests half of the \u00a32,500 cost of their all-inclusive break on their first day - before the family had a chance to sample breakfast. 'And, yes, the food was pretty horrible as well,' Lynn adds. </p> <p>The consumer watchdog Holiday Travel Watch is currently receiving hundreds of complaints every week from disgruntled British holiday makers in Bulgaria. 'It is an eastern country and it doesn't appear to be geared up as other countries are for tourism,' says Brenda Wall, who set up the group. 'Tour operators have seen it as a cheap destination that they can sell to the masses and make profit on. Lynn's hotel is typical of the kind of complaints we are receiving about Bulgaria.' </p> <p>In fact, the only people who appeared to be enjoying their stay at the hotel in question were journalists. The weekend Lynn arrived one tabloid ran a story about holidaymakers forced to sleep in the foyer because their rooms were not ready. During Lynn's stay an undercover camera crew was busy filming a holidays from hell-style programme that will be shown later this year. </p> <p>Now most holidaymakers are home, there are two main ways of seeking redress for those whose breaks have been ruined. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) runs its own arbitration scheme which covers more than 7,000 high street shops. There were 16,258 complaints to it last year and 1,103 went as far as arbitration, where you and the travel company agree to accept the decision of an independent referee as legally binding. As an alternative, there is the small claims court where you can claim compensation of up to \u00a35,000 and make small personal injury claims of \u00a31,000 or less. In the small claims court formalities are dispensed with - so there are no wigs, the parties sit around a table and there is no need for a lawyer to represent you. Fees are proportionate to the amount claimed - \u00a330 for a claim of up to \u00a33,000; up to \u00a3120 for a claim of up to \u00a35,000. </p> <p>Under the ABTA scheme, there are fees of \u00a372.85 for a claim of up to \u00a33,000 and up to \u00a3164.50 for claims up to \u00a315,000. </p> <p>ABTA claims that its arbitration scheme is far more user-friendly than the courts. 'You pay your fee, send off your documentation and within two months you get your judgment,' explains ABTA spokesman Sean Tipton. 'It's very straightforward and run for the benefit of the public and not our members.' </p> <p>Holidaymakers should always make their feelings known while on the holiday and fill out a complaint form that their tour operator should provide, he says. 'On your return, you need to write to the tour operator, and our members must send you a substantive reply within no more than 28 days,' Tipton says. 'If they take longer, contact us, because that is a breach of our code of conduct.' </p> <p>You must make two attempts at least to resolve your dispute and, ABTA claims, that sorts out 90 per cent of complaints. 'If you reach an impasse and you want to go to arbitration then all you need to do is apply online for the forms,' Tipton says. </p> <p>The arbitration is a paper-based procedure - in other words, there is no hearing - and you should send in your form together with supporting evidence such as photographs and video footage. ABTA claims that 80 per cent of arbitrations are resolved in favour of the consumer. As the arbitration is legally binding, you are then prevented from taking your case through the courts. </p> <p>Wall advises that a specialist lawyer should always be a first port of call. 'A lot of the time people haven't got a claim in law or the claim is so minor it's not worth pursuing,' she says. Holiday Travel Watch has its own panel of solicitors which offers an initial free advice session and, thereafter, might run the case on a 'no win, no fee' basis. </p> <p>The ABTA scheme recently came under fire when Holiday Which?, the Consumers' Association's magazine, compared and contrasted the experiences of 11 groups of unhappy holidaymakers travelling with 10 tour operators. The judges made higher awards in eight of the 11 claims. Anne Harvey, of Holiday Which?, says she would opt for the courts over ABTA 'every time'. 'The results are better and the process assumes less knowledge on your part,' she says. 'I've been a lawyer for 20 years now and I found the ABTA form difficult to complete.' Harvey reckons that it is 'perfectly feasible' for holidaymakers to represent themselves in the small claims court. 'When the judge can see how distressed you are as you sit face-to-face, then there is a certain element of impact there which you will never get on paper,' she says. </p> <p>Alan Saggerson is a barrister at No 1 Serjeants' Inn, London, who specialises in advising both holidaymakers and tour operators. He reckons payouts in the small claims courts are likely to be larger than under the ABTA scheme but not 'radically so'. 'But the question of money is only one factor here,' he says. 'There are quite a few advantages to arbitration. It is less stressful, it's all done in writing, and you get an answer much more speedily than you do with the court.' He points out that, even though this special division of the courts is designed for non-lawyers, it can be intimidating for the lay person, not least when the tour operator comes in armed with a legal team. Unsurprisingly, ABTA take issue with the Holiday Which? report. 'Our experience is that the awards are pretty similar,' ABTA's Tipton says.</p> <p>Over the last few years, the more unrealistic expectations of holidaymakers have been trying the patience of courts and tour operators. In one notable case, a sceptical district judge, Anthony Cleary, packed his trunks and suntan lotion and jetted off to a three-star Palm Court Hotel in Malta to find out for himself whether it was the 'hellhole' that three families insisted it was in their compensation claim. In fact, the judge reckoned that, considering the price, holidaymakers had received something of a bargain. He ruled that the families' complaints were 'largely unjustified' and he was 'mystified' by complaints that the toast was cold since guests made the toast themselves. </p> <p>'On some occasions consumers are ready to complain about every imaginable difficulty that they've had,' reckons Saggerson. 'It's very common for people to pull themselves out of the pool dripping wet, slip on a tiled floor and then complain that the floor was tiled,' he says. 'Also, at the risk of sounding unsympathetic, a six-hour wait at an airport is a not a \"holiday from hell\".'</p>",
  "Lord Nelson, the vice-admiral who defeated the French at Trafalgar and is still the greatest naval hero celebrated in British history, had a sensitive and cultured side to his nature, newly discovered letters reveal. <p>Not only did he privately attempt to secure the safe passage of a group of Ancient Greek statues from Athens that had fallen into his hands, he also extended his personal protection on board ship to a foreign man of letters, in spite of the fact that he was French. </p> <p>These unexpected sentiments in a man usually hailed as one of the toughest and most focused leaders of all time have come to light among more than 1,000 new letters brought together as part of a project building up to the 200th anniversary of the admiral's death on board the Victory in October 1805. </p> <p>Put together, the vast haul of previously unseen correspondence helps to create a picture of a more caring Lord Nelson, in contrast to the stern image painted of him in recent biographies. While some of the private letters collated from archives all over the world by naval scholar Dr Colin White con firm the detail of the spying network he ran across the Mediterranean from 1803 until his death, and others elaborate on his obvious talents as a naval tactician, the most startling letters reveal the vice-admiral in a much gentler mood, underlining his strong feelings not only for his mistress, Emma Hamilton, but also for learning and the finer things in life. </p> <p>'We get a much better sense of his personality from these letters,' said White this weekend on the eve of the public release of his treasure trove of new documents. 'He was quite a writer, too. I have transcribed many of the letters by hand and, although his punctuation was not good, his style is so clear that it is easy to follow the sense.' </p> <p>Dr White, who was commissioned by the National Maritime and Naval Museums to seek out remaining Nelson documentation and who, in May 2002, discovered the original battle plan for Trafalgar scrawled in Nelson's own hand, has been amazed by the amount of material he has uncovered and by the emerging sensitivities of this iconic man of war. </p> <p>In a letter to Prime Minister Henry Addington dated 13 July 1803, which Dr White came across in America, Nel son writes of 26 cases of statues and busts from Athens that he has found in a captured French corvette. </p> <p>'I have taken upon Me to Order them to be sent to England consigned to Sir Joseph Banks as President of the Royal Society, for if our Gov ernment chuse to buy these Articles of Antiquity, I think it but proper that it should have the offer. They would sell well in this Country. Lord Elgin I am told offered six thousand pounds for a part of them,' he explains. </p> <p>In another letter, discov ered among Lord Holland's papers at the British Library, Nelson writes on 14 October of the same year of the pride he had taken into looking after a French man of letters, a 'Mr Le Chevalier', 'in the universal beneficial work he is engaged upon to the utmost of my power. The Man bestowing knowledge on the human Race cannot be the enemy of any Nation, but every Nation is bound to be the Protector of that man. He is while so engaged a Citizen of the World. I lament that Mr Le Chevalier did not put it in my power to shew him how attentive I should have been to your recommendation by showing him every civility in my power.' </p> <p>Ironically, Dr White sug gests, these cultured impulses to embrace learning and preserve history are demonstrations of the influence of his good friend Sir William Hamilton, the aristocrat, diplomat and antiquarian whose wife Emma was Nelson's secret mistress. </p> <p>Before Trafalgar and after a stint of duty patrolling the English Channel, Nelson took a short-lived period of semi-retirement, joining both Emma and Sir William on an estate he had bought for them in south London. The two years the lovers spent together were marred only by the fact they could not make their relationship a legitimate one and so publicly recognise their daughter, Horatia, while Sir William lived. </p> <p>Among the fresh family material unearthed is an earlier letter from Nelson to his sister-in-law, Sarah Nelson, begging her to stay with Emma as a chaperone so that he can visit her with apparent innocence. </p> <p>'I beg intreat and pray that you will not leave our dear excellent Lady Hamilton,' Nelson writes. 'She is miserable at the thought of it and so am I, you can have good lodgings, and no bugs, and they shall be no expense to you.' </p> <p>Many of the new letters, which represent a 20 per cent increase in known Nelson material, are to go on public display for the first time in a blockbuster exhibition being planned for 2005. Called 'Nelson and Napoleon', it will run from 7 July to 13 November at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.

  "<b> Dear Colin, </b> <br> It sometimes seems to me that the educational world is inhabited by two completely different types of people. <p>The first type, whom I shall call the Pessimists, maintain that the essential purpose of the education system is to sort and sift young people so that they find their 'appropriate' status in life as early as possible. </p> <p>This group argues that selection should be embedded as deeply as possible through 11-plus (and even five-plus, as the Tories now propose) examinations, that the expansion of university places should be halted or slammed into reverse, that most curriculum and assessment changes over the last 50 years have been negative and that far too many people have educational aspirations which they should simply abandon. Your letter demonstrates - surprisingly to me I confess - that you now fall into this generally conservative group. </p> <p>The second type - the Optimists - maintain that the education system should enable every individual to use and develop their own talents to the highest level possible, in the belief that this benefits both the individual and the wider society. Rather than sifting people into 'graded grains' at five, 11, 16 or 18, education should seek to meet the personal needs and challenges of every individual throughout life. </p> <p>People should be encouraged to raise their aspirations and educational opportunities, including university places, should be increased. Our curriculum and assessment systems should reflect the massive changes which have taken place in our society and economy. I am most certainly one of this group, and am delighted to be part of a government that is doing its best to create an education system which meets these ambitions, which I do admit are great and difficult to achieve. </p> <p>It is simple observation that so strongly convinces me that the Optimists' point of view is superior to that of the Pessimists. </p> <p>We, the Optimists, observe, firstly, that the world is changing immensely and increasingly rapidly in just about every respect - environmental, technological, economic or social. We conclude that our education system has the duty of equipping both individuals and our society so that we can control and manage that change to the good. </p> <p>We observe, secondly, that it is those countries, societies and individuals who prioritise education, and achieve high standards, which are best placed to prosper in this world of change. Similarly, we observe that those who rest on past laurels or refuse to meet the challenges of change stultify and decay. </p> <p>We observe, thirdly, that there are literally millions of people in this country alone, and billions in the world as a whole, whose past education has left their abilities underdeveloped, their potential underexploited and so their lives less fulfilled than they had the intrinsic talent to expect. We must do better for the future. </p> <p>The Pessimists' response to these observations is simple - it is to ignore them, often harking back to an allegedly golden past, which usually glosses over far too many of the down-sides hidden by the undoubted successes. </p> <p>The optimists' response is more complicated, since we have the responsibility of seeking to create an education system which meets the challenges I describe. There are three main themes. </p> <p>First, we have to raise the resources to fund an education system which meets these needs. That means funding for under-fives and primary education being as much a priority as universities. And as we have seen, changes in this area are usually controversial but no less necessary for that. </p> <p>Second, we have to create curriculums and systems of assessment which are designed to do more than sort and sift. The modern curriculum must promote the highest standards while meeting individual needs. Assessment systems must strengthen educational aspirations and show individuals the best way to progress. For the 14-19 age range this is what Mike Tomlinson's proposals will be designed to do, and that is why I welcome his approach. </p> <p>And third, we have to ensure that educational opportunities are more widely available throughout life. Our current institutional structure is not best fitted to that purpose, and so change is needed there too. </p> <p>So the Optimists' agenda is indeed challenging, but I am certain that the direction is right. </p> <p>Of course there are important nuggets of the Pessimists' arguments with which I agree. For example, we do need to be eternally vigilant that at all levels standards are constantly maintained or raised, and that extends to 'traditional' standards, such as grammar, spelling and algebra, just as much as any other. </p> <p>We do need to nurture 'traditional' areas of study like the classic civilisations and their languages, rather than letting them fade away. We do need to help universities make their selections on a sound basis, ideally by enabling selection to take place after the A-level qualification rather than mainly before, and on the basis of more information about the applicant's capacity and achievement. And I know that Mike Tomlinson will make proposals to address this in his report. </p> <p>But history is on the side of the thrust of the Optimists' argument. It is the case that each individual has within themself immense talents and that our education system will, and should, be judged by how well it enables those talents to be fulfilled, to use what has become a clich\u00e9, for the many and not the few. </p> <p>You once shared this outlook, but last Sunday's letter just offers another example of the type of punditry about examinations which has become one of the rituals of summer. In your case the argument was spiced up by the invention of a quotation intended, falsely, to demonstrate that I have a narrow and constricted view of education, which is actually just about the reverse of what I actually believe or put into practice. </p> <p>I hope that, upon reflection, you will return to your earlier optimism. </p> <p><b>Yours sincerely, Charles</b></p>",
  "It is famous for attracting celebrities such as Madonna and Demi Moore, but now the controversial religious movement Kabbalah, whose teachings are based on the mystical interpretation of Jewish law, is looking to attract a new kind of British devotee. <p>The US Kabbalah Centre, the movement's most powerful body, wants to open a dedicated Kabbalah school near London. In October it will start a 10-week pilot programme involving 30 pupils at an unnamed non-Jewish school in Hertfordshire. </p> <p>The organisers believe the Spirituality for Kids initiative will pave the way for opening the dedicated school within five years. The US Kabbalah Centre already has schools in Los Angeles and New York. </p> <p>Michael Berg, the centre's co-director, told the paper Jewish News: 'I am very excited about opening Spirituality for Kids in London. Any time we can offer young people the tools to take control of their destiny and reach their ultimate potential is a great thing..' </p> <p>But the project is alarming Jewish leaders. London rabbi Yitzchak Schochet said: 'The fact that they are now peddling their gibberish to children only compounds the tragedy of how the good name of Judaism is being brought into ill repute.' </p> <p>There is concern about a number of Kabbalah practices. Some recruits have told how they were pressured to hand over large sums of money to the movement. Others said they were told to sever their ties with friends and family who expressed scepticism about the faith. </p> <p>Critics have queried the prices charged for merchandise at the London centre, including \u00a3300 for copies of the Zohar, the movement's ancient text, red string bracelets for \u00a315 each and 'blessed bottled water' at \u00a32.80. </p> <p>A recruitment drive could prove popular with British children, however. Britney Spears and David Beckham have both been seen wearing the red bracelets while Naomi Campbell is a recent convert.</p>",
  "<p>Paul had spent his whole life dreaming about his mother. He imagined what it would be like to meet someone who looked like him, who offered unconditional love and who took away the empty feeling he had always carried in the pit of his stomach. </p> <p>'I thought meeting her would make me whole. I had had a happy childhood but somewhere deep in my gut, I have always been hollow,' said Paul, now 42 years old and living in Kent. </p> <p>But Paul's meeting with his mother was a disaster. 'I now believe you can never recreate that mother-child relationship,' he said. 'Away from the dreams, the initial rejection an adopted child has suffered makes unconditional love impossible to recreate in the cold light of reality. </p> <p>'I understand why my mother gave me up but I still find it impossible to forgive,' he said. 'Now I have to come to terms with the fact that I have spent my life looking for something that was never there.' </p> <p>Paul is not alone in his disappointment. Research by the Children's Society has revealed that, eight years after first making contact, almost 60 per cent of adopted children have ceased contact with, been rejected by or rejected further contact with their birth parent. </p> <p>The Adoption, Search and Reunion study of almost 500 adoptees has been released ahead of the new Adoption And Children Bill 2002 that will, when implemented next month, open the way for birth parents to trace their children. </p> <p>As the first major British project to look at the long-term nature of adopted people's restored relationship with their birth relatives, the study pioneers comparisons of the experiences of adopted people who search for birth relatives (searchers) with those who do not (non-searchers). </p> <p>The study found that although outright rejection from a birth relative is fairly rare a surprising number of reunions cease after one or two letters or a single face-to-face meeting. </p> <p>According to Rose Wallace, a specialist in post-adoption care at the Children's Society, birth parents often have far greater expectations of their reunion than an adopted child and can make destructively excessive demands. </p> <p>'The greater pressure tends to come from the birth parent, who has higher expectations of the relationship than the adopted child, who often only wants the answer to questions about their own identity,' she said. </p> <p>'The parent has very conscious memories of what it felt like to part with the children and will have continued to think about the child over the years, while the child is unlikely to have have thought about the issue with the same intensity.' </p> <p>According to the survey, over 70 per cent of searchers and 89 per cent of non-searchers fail to feel an instant bond with their birth parent, with one in six new relationships breaking down within one year after initial contact and almost 43 per cent of relationships abandoned within eight years. </p> <p>Now experts are warning birth parents not to get their hopes up when the new legislation is announced. 'Being told that a birth parent admits no feelings for you is likely to be shattering,' said Julia Feast, co-author of The Adoption Reunion Handbook, the first 'how to' guide for those searching for birth relatives. 'It is hard to see the person as anything other than callous or unnatural.' </p> <p>Jackie, a 47-year-old office manager in London, was shattered when, after two years searching, she discovered her birth mother had little interest in her. </p> <p>'Immediately I looked her in the eye, it was like a big hole had been finally filled inside me,' said Jackie. 'You think that when you find your birth relative, they will be everything to you but it can make things worse: you can be horribly rejected all over again or find out things about your past or your birth parents that you don't want to hear. </p> <p>'You can end up feeling like a lesser person, a total reject,' she added. 'You have to be open to it being a dreadful experience.' </p> <p>Richard Layliss, a fireman, was rejected after tracing his birth mother, Jenny. 'She wrote me an awful letter saying she would be devastated if I made contact,' he said. 'It was a massive rejection after all those years of wondering and hoping. I couldn't have anticipated how that made me feel.' </p> <p>But even for those birth relatives whose reunions are short-lived, over 80 per cent of adoptees said they were glad they had made the effort, with half of all searchers and a third of non-searchers reporting how finding the missing bits of their stories had made them feel more complete. </p> <p>Reunions are not always so shattering: Mark Newell, a 42-year-old teacher living in Dartford with his wife, Ruth, was adopted by Joan Newell after his birth mother, Maureen Short, gave him up as a baby. </p> <p>Newell spent five years thinking about his birth mother before he had the courage to begin searching when he was 35. Within weeks he had traced her to Southend, just 45 minutes' drive from his own home. </p> <p>Newell and Joan met at the train station near her home three months after he first made contact. 'I didn't know how I was going to approach it, or what I was going to call her but it was easy: I called her 'mum' straight away. </p> <p>'You just can't replace that lost time: we have bonded but not in the way I'd been hoping or expecting. I thought I would met my birth mum and all my problems would fall into place but they didn't,' he said. </p> <p>'But whereas before, I had attributed my problems to being adopted, I think I've taken responsibility for my own issues now. It's empowering; I've become more of a man.' </p> <p>For Short, being traced by her son was the end of 30 years of guilt. 'Giving up my son was the worst thing I have ever done in my life,' said Short, now 66 years old and living with her partner Peter Lee and their three sons. 'I can't believe I was capable of giving up a child. I just feel I wish I'd tried to cope. </p> <p>'When he called me 'mum' for the first time, it was wonderful. I can't ever forgive myself for not trying to keep him but it's Mark now who tells me I must not look back and feel guilty,' she said. 'He says we have to look forward to the future. I can't believe how lucky I am that he decided to trace me.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Adoption Reunion Handbook is published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday September 5 2004</b> <br>  The article below refers to a meeting at the London headquarters of the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House on the future of Equatorial Guinea and 'active discussions of rumours of coup plots'. We should clarify that the meeting concerned revenue transparency in Equatorial Guinea. There was brief discussion about the Sao Tome and Principe coup in 2003 but there is no suggestion that Chatham House was involved in the alleged plot.      One of Sir Mark Thatcher's key business partners has turned 'state witness' and is alleged to have given dramatic new evidence to South African police investigating Thatcher's role in the alleged coup to overthrow the President of Equatorial Guinea. <p>The revelation comes as speculation mounts over what British and US officials knew about the alleged plot and when. Insiders claim that officials in both countries were aware of a planned attempt to topple the leader of the oil-rich west African state, although both governments have denied this claim. </p> <p>Thatcher's business partner, former crack mercenary pilot Crause Steyl, is believed to have handed over details of Thatcher's investment in an aviation firm that had contracts with Simon Mann, the old Etonian and former SAS officer in jail in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>The former Prime Minister's son was arrested in Cape Town last week over accusations that he helped finance the alleged coup that aimed to overthrow President Obiang and replace him with the exiled Opposition leader Severo Moto. </p> <p>The Observer, which first revealed details of Thatcher's alleged involvement in the coup last month, has been told by South African sources that Steyl accompanied Moto to the Canary Islands on the eve of the day the alleged putsch was to happen. </p> <p>They were flown from Madrid to the islands in a South African-registered King Air 200 by a stunt pilot and landed in the morning of 7 March. The plane is then reported to have flown on to the Malian capital of Bamako where Moto awaited news from the mercenary leaders. The next day, the Boeing 727 carrying Mann and his crew of more than 60 mercenaries was impounded in Harare and those on board arrested. </p> <p>Steyl's evidence could be highly damaging to Thatcher, who faces 15 years in jail after being charged last week with helping to finance the mercenary plot to topple the President. The government of Equatorial Guinea is requesting an interview with Thatcher in South Africa and is hoping to having him extradited to face trial there. </p> <p>Thatcher's defence team in Cape Town - which insists he is innocent of all charges - believes Steyl is emerging as central to the prosecution and say they have been told to stay away from him. The lawyers suspect that Steyl has given the South African police a detailed affidavit containing several statements. Steyl was unavailable for comment. </p> <p>The Observer has obtained details of the contract signed by Steyl and Mann on 16 January to provide aircraft and aviation services. Steyl is alleged to have persuaded Thatcher to invest $250,000 (\u00a3139, 586) in a joint venture between a company called Triple A and Mann's Guernsey firm Logo Ltd to provide aircraft and aviation services. </p> <p>Thatcher's friends insist the investment was a 'peripheral one' in a flying doctor service and that the initials Triple A stand for Air Ambulance Africa. Similar cover stories have been used in mercenary operations, South African intelligence sources say, but Thatcher's friends say that his relationship with Steyl may be 'exaggerated and misinterpreted'. </p> <p>Mann's associates say he relied increasingly on Steyl's experience in running air operations as plans for the coup plot played out this year. The two first met when Mann established Executive Outcomes in South Africa in the early Nineties and won a contract to run military operations in support of the Angolan government's operations against Unita rebels. </p> <p>Steyl worked on several other private military operations such as the Executive Outcomes contract in Sierra Leone. It was Steyl and another former mercenary who arranged the leasing from US Dodson Aviation of the Boeing 727-100 which was seized in Zimbabwe with 70 former South African soldiers on board last 7 March. Steyl's brother Neil was piloting it, and has been held in Harare since March. </p> <p>One of Steyl's associates suggested that it was concern for his brother's fate that prompted Crause Steyl to start co-operating with the Zimbabwean and South African investigations. </p> <p>As further details emerge of the extraordinary coup plot, speculation is mounting over the role played by western intelligence agencies in the alleged plot to oust Obiang. An individual intimately involved in the alleged coup has claimed that British officials were aware of the plot to replace Obiang with Moto. </p> <p>South African sources claim the rumours of the coup were circulating among diplomatic circles in Pretoria ear lier this year - although the Foreign Office denies any 'prior knowledge'. </p> <p>The allegation that British officials knew about the potential illegal coup comes amid claims from British and Spanish intelligence agencies that French spies helped to scupper the plot. </p> <p>It is also claimed that the US and Spanish security services were involved in the plot to replace the dictator of the tiny West African state, which has vast oil reserves. </p> <p>Although it is not suggested that British intelligence was complicit in any coup plot, the claim that some officials might have had advance knowledge of the attempted putsch has prompted opposition politicians to demand a statement from the Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw. Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, last night called on the government to come clean about its knowledge of the operations. </p> <p>Last night the Foreign Office categorically denied that it had any 'prior knowledge of the alleged plot'. </p> <p>The Observer has learnt that in February this year there was a meeting at the London headquarters of the Royal Institute of International Affairs on the future of Equatorial Guinea. It is known that there was at least one government official present as well as representatives of the oil industry. According to sources present, there were active discussions about rumours of coup plots there. </p> <p>Mann is accused of being the mercenary leader hired by mysterious business and political figures involved in an old-fashioned battle to control the oil reserves. Up for grabs was a huge multi-million pound bounty of cash plus a share of lucrative oil concessions. </p> <p>Many in the intelligence community are asking whether a hidden hand was played by Western powers. Some suggest American, Spanish and British interests offered their backing to exiled Moto. On the other side were the French, who believed a successful coup would have cemented US domination in the country, where US oil giant Exxon Mobil already enjoys the most important drilling concessions. British intelligence sources have suggested that the French learned of the plot and helped to sabotage it. </p> <p>Spanish intelligence sources have made similar claims. Former Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar was a close ally of the exiled Moto, who lived in Madrid. </p> <p>Mann, who was found guilty on Friday in a Zimbabwean court of attempting to buy arms for the botched coup, confessed to Spanish involvement in plot. </p> <p>The Spanish government has denied this claim. But it has emerged that earlier this year two Spanish warships left the Nato naval base based near C\u00e1diz. One of the frigates had on board 500 elite troops and the soldiers are reported to have been told they were heading for Equatorial Guinea. </p> <p>Nick du Toit, one of Mann's alleged accomplices arrested in Equatorial Guinea, told the country's court last week: 'The Spanish government would recognise the Moto government and it had the blessing of some American higher-up politicians.' Moto has dismissed the coup plot as 'complete fiction'. </p> <p>It was Du Toit who named Thatcher in a statement last week that led to his arrest. Thatcher's alleged involvement first emerged when The Observer obtained details of two letters written by Mann from prison referring to the former Prime Minister's son as 'Scratcher'. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Antony.barnett@observer.co.uk\">Antony.barnett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "An Algerian in his late thirties walks nervously into a prison chapel at Woodhill high-security jail in Milton Keynes. For some reason, the authorities have decided that a Christian place of worship is the best place for this devout Muslim to tell his story. <p>But the venue is the least of the problems for Mr A, who has been certified by Home Secretary David Blunkett as a terrorist: an Islamist extremist with links to Chechen rebels, Algerian armed groups and at least one known al-Qaeda suspect held in Britain. </p> <p>We cannot name Mr A because his anonymity is protected by a court order to guarantee the safety of his family in Britain and Algeria. Along with 11 other foreign detainees incarcerated under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, he exists in a penal no-man's-land and can be kept in jail indefinitely. </p> <p>He is charged with no offence by a British police officer, convicted of no crime by a jury, but judged such a risk to the public by MI5, the security service, that he can be detained until Blunkett judges the 'war on terror' is over. No hard evidence has to be produced to back the intelligence service claims. </p> <p>'Just imagine a British man held indefinitely in Algeria,' he says. 'This is a slow death and they are destroying my mind.' </p> <p>Dressed in a green T-shirt, beige chinos and trainers, Mr A looks tidy and well groomed. Close-cropped beard and neat, curly black hair also suggest he is keeping body and soul together. But throughout the two-hour interview one leg jigs unconsciously with nervous ten sion, a sign of the well-documented trauma which comes from indefinite detention. </p> <p>Unlike convicted terrorists, who leave prison at the end of their sentences, this father of five could be in jail for ever. </p> <p>After two-and-a-half years in custody, Mr A has finally been authorised to talk to the press after a long legal battle by The Observer and the Guardian; he is the first detainee held in a high-security prison to do so. He has not been interrogated by police or the intelligence services about his activities. Neither has he been told what evidence they possess for his alleged links to international terrorists. </p> <p>The paradoxes of his situation are multiple. He has been detained without trial precisely because there is not enough evidence against him to bring before the courts. He cannot be deported because the UK authorities judge he would be at risk of torture or death if he returned to Algeria, yet can choose to return voluntarily to his home country whenever he wishes. He is a certified international terrorist, but he can choose to leave for a country other than Algeria if one will accept him. </p> <p>The case against Mr A was discussed in May in open sessions of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), the tribunal that deals with deportation cases involving national security issues. At its heart was the allegation that he supported the Chechen struggle against the Russian government, a claim Mr A does not deny. </p> <p>According to witnesses, Mr A provided boots, a sleeping bag and satellite phone equipment to the rebels in the breakaway Caucasus republic. It was even admitted that such support would not have been classed as terrorism before the suicide attacks in America. Intelligence officers pointed out that, had the equipment been provided to Chechen separatists themselves, then Mr A would not have been committing a crime. But they claimed that, as the boots and sleeping bag were destined for a small group of Arab fighters with known links to al-Qaeda, his actions do constitute international terrorism. </p> <p>Mr A remains proud of the work he did for the Chechen cause: 'Because of the conflict, people are driven from their homes. It is our duty to help them. We sent many things, not just boots - clothing for the poor and needy.' </p> <p>The government claims Mr A also associated with known Islamist extremists and supports militant groups in Algeria, which he violently denies. </p> <p>Last October, SIAC decided that Mr A had procured material for Arab Islamists fighting in Chechnya and was a supporter of an extremist faction in Algeria and concluded: 'We have reasonable grounds for believing that A is an international terrorist as defined by the 2001 Act and for believing that his presence in the United Kingdom is a risk to national security.' </p> <p>Mr A says: 'I am not a terrorist, but I am a member of a group: five kids and a wife.' </p> <p>He just wants to talk about his family. He has not seen his teenage daughters for two years and does not like his wife and younger children visiting him in prison. </p> <p>'Imagine this environment for anyone who has not done any crime. I was scared even to bring [my family] to prison. It will have a great impact seeing all the officers and dogs.' </p> <p>Mr A's wife, a European convert to Islam, has been diagnosed as clinically depressed. His children have become desperate. In a letter to their 'Abee' (Daddy) this month, they wrote: 'It is unfair for you to be there, and we wish you were here to look after us. We dream about you a lot and you've been there for too long and we need you here so much. Inshallah, you'll arrive home soon and our family will be complete again.' </p> <p>Mr A says his children have told him that almost every night they dream of seeing him walking through the door. He claims they are still traumatised by the dawn raid in December 2001, when they were woken to see their father dragged off to prison. His wife was eight months pregnant and, despite begging that he be allowed to stay until she gave birth, he was taken to the Belmarsh high-security prison in London and has been in jail ever since. </p> <p>He finds it particularly difficult not to see his youngest son, born while he was in custody, and finds the child's rare visits with his mother deeply upsetting: 'My son doesn't know me. He screams when he sees me. I can't hold him and can't hug him because he is screaming all the time.' </p> <p>Mr A himself, in common with many other detainees, is on antidepressants. Already Abu Rideh, a Palestinian prisoner, has been transferred to Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital, and three other detainees at Belmarsh are said to be in a state of serious psychiatric collapse. </p> <p>Belmarsh and Woodhill have been described as 'Britain's Guantanamo', but Mr A says the everyday living conditions are not the problem: 'They look after you, give you a cell on your own. But is it me or my family who is punished? They have driven my wife mad.' </p> <p>The problem for Mr A is the unknowns. How long will he be held? What is happening to his family? As a certified terrorist, will anyone who tries to help him be labelled an extremist in their turn? 'If they cannot try me in a court of law, give me other options. Just let me be somewhere with my family.' </p> <p>In his desperation, Mr A has decided that he may even now risk torture or death to return to Algeria if he fails to get bail at his next attempt. He says his fellow detainees have been shocked by his decision because of the danger he and his family will face on their return. But he can no longer bear being separated from his family. </p> <p>He comes from near the eastern Algerian coastal city of Annaba, close to the Tunisian border, hard hit by the civil war between the government and Islamists which has cost more than 100,000 lives. 'It's a beautiful town by the sea,' he says. 'I can't wait.' </p> <p>Incredibly, his family in Algeria does not know he is in prison. He still speaks to them regularly over the phone from Woodhill and tells them everything is all right. When relatives ask to speak to the children, he says he is calling from the office. </p> <p>He knows that he will be questioned by the authorities when he arrives in Algeria, but says anything will be preferable to not knowing his fate: 'In Algeria there is a proper legal system. All these political games are not for me. I want to find a way of being with my family. I want to leave this civilisation.' </p> <p>Blunkett has argued that 11 September 2001 necessitated a new approach to the threat of international terrorism and that the legislation which followed was a response to the exceptional circumstances now faced in the war against terror. </p> <p>Yet supporters of the detainees point out that in their 30 months of detention no attempt was made to debrief any of them about what they might know, despite allegedly being some of the most dangerous international terrorists in Britain. </p> <p>Two months ago each man received a letter from the Home Office asking if he would be prepared to co-operate with MI5. The letter, dated 3 June, states: 'The security service would welcome the opportunity to discuss any knowledge you may have of international terrorism in the United Kingdom or overseas.' </p> <p>So far, no one has agreed to co-operate because no one admits to being a terrorist. </p> <p>Mr A says he is grateful to the British people who have campaigned for the detainees and was particularly touched by a Nottingham priest who spoke against indefinite imprisonment in a service. </p> <p>Asked what he would like the British people to know about the detainees, whose names they are not even allowed to know, Mr A says: 'The government you vote for is a democratic government, but is abusing its power. It holds people without trial and without sentence for an indefinite period. They have damaged our children and wives.' </p> <p>He says he would still like to see his children grow up in Britain, but knows that the chance is fading by the day. </p> <p>'I cannot see my family destroyed under my eyes. I divorce you, Britain,' he says, before leaving the chapel for his cell.</p>",
  "<p>The reading and writing speeds of millions of office workers are being dramatically impaired by poor air quality. </p> <p>For the first time, researchers have measured how sick building syndrome - the mystery flu-like illness often blamed on germs spread by office air conditioning - could be affecting workers' performance. </p> <p>Typing and reading speeds in offices with poor air quality were reduced by up to 9 per cent, the equivalent loss of 4.5 hours in an average 48-hour working week. Experts from the Watford-based Research Building Establishment, the government advisers on indoor air pollution, said the research suggested sick building syndrome could be costing the economy billions by lowering productivity. </p> <p>Experts from the International Centre for Indoor Environment and Energy studied workers in air-conditioned call centres in Denmark, similar to those in the UK, over an eight-week period. Among factors that affected the work rate of employees were used filters on air conditioning systems. Fumes given off by products such as new computers also had a profound affect, reducing workers' ability to type accurately and quickly. While sick building syndrome has been linked to headaches and lethargy, it has taken years for experts to quantify an impact on peoples' ability to work. </p> <p>Dr Paul Harrison, director of the MRC Institute for Environment and Health, said: 'This research will make a number of bosses think again.' British business currently pays a \u00a311 billion a year bill for sick leave, the equivalent of \u00a3400 for each of the 28 million workers. </p> <p>Now experts, led by David Wyon, who carried out the work for the Danish-based International Centre for Indoor Environment and Energy, will attempt to determine what precisely is causing the loss in productivity.Badly installed air conditioning systems have been considered a culprit along with fumes from new carpets. </p> <p>Dr Derek Crump, associate director of BRE Environment, is among those alarmed that Britain has yet to begin labelling products such as carpets according to their emissions. 'We have done very little to control emissions, while in Germany and Japan products have been labelled for years on that criteria,' he said.

  "<p>A small company that has made the first cheap version of a schizophrenia drug has accused one of the world's giant pharmaceutical firms of trying to prevent it from being taken up across British hospitals. </p> <p>Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug which has helped to keep thousands of seriously mentally ill patients stable and out of hospital. The NHS spends about \u00a355 million a year buying the drug under the brand name Clozaril from Novartis. </p> <p>But Denfleet, a small company, has now produced a far cheaper, generic version which it says could halve the NHS bill and allow thousands more patients to be given the treatment. It is engaged in a fierce battle over the marketing and the safety claims of the new medication. Now Denfleet's generic version of the drug, known as Denzapine, has begun to compete head on with Clozaril. </p> <p>Because there is a small but significant risk of patients developing a potentially fatal blood disorder on either of the medications, all patients have to be regularly monitored. This makes the situation very unusual and has led to one of the fiercest battles yet seen in Britain over the introduction of a new medicine. </p> <p> The Observer has spoken to hospital staff who claim that Novartis's representatives have tried to denigrate the new drug by suggesting in subtle ways that it is less reliable. Two pamphlets produced by Swiss-based Novartis have had to be withdrawn, and the Medicines Healthcare Regulatory Agency has upheld two complaints about the company. </p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading has now decided to investigate whether there has been a breach of the Competitions Act. A spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that we think there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there has been a breach of the act, but we cannot say anything further right now.' </p> <p>Henry Arnold, chairman of Denfleet, said that the hostility shown by Novartis was extraordinary. A former Fleet Street dentist, Arnold set up an import business and decided a few years ago that his company could make a generic version of the drug. </p> <p>'We've passed all the relevant inspections, in Europe and here, to show that our system is safe. But Novartis is an enormous company, and they can see their profits disappearing now they've got competition. We've had all kinds of rubbish talked about our products, people telling hospital staff that our scheme is not robust and so on.' </p> <p>Lee Wells, of Novartis, said that it was prepared to fully co-operate with the investigation. 'This is the same ground as has already been dealt with by the MHRA. We have nothing to hide and have complied fully with all the regulations.' </p> <p>Novartis is the world's fifth largest pharmaceutical company and itself makes many generic drugs. Its sales amounted to $25 billion last year, with its pharmaceutical division accounting for $16bn of that sum. It also manufactures Ritalin, the drug given to thousands of children worldwide with hyperactivity disorders. </p> <p>Novartis also helps to fund a number of charities, including Rethink, one of the leading mental health voluntary organisations in Britain. </p> <p>Rethink has been unwilling to give its wholehearted support to the new drug until it is satisfied about its efficacy. Clozapine was invented back in the Seventies but had to be taken off the market 10 years ago because of some fatalities. When it was reintroduced, the makers had to ensure they could monitor patient safety through monthly blood tests. Since then, it has proved to be very safe and effective. </p> <p>But those at the sharp end of the battle are the hospital pharmacists who have to make the decision about whether to switch over to a different brand of drug. </p> <p>One of those who has decided to use Denzapine is Steve Bazire, pharmacy services director at the Norfolk Mental Health Care Trust. </p> <p>He said: 'There's been a lot of pressure put on people to stay with Clozaril. There's been suggestions that safety might be compromised. Yet, if anything, I think using the new drug is safer because the blood tests are now carried out at our local district general hospital, where they can pick up any additional problems.' </p> <p>Before, the blood tests were carried out at a central laboratory. </p> <p>Michael Marven, the chief pharmacist at the Oxfordshire Mental Health Trust, said it had also switched to Denzapine, which would save \u00a3170,000 a year. </p> <p>'If we can save this kind of money,' he said, 'it will be possible to take on extra patients without having to ask for extra money from the primary care trusts.' </p> <p>The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice) issued guidance on atypical antipsychotic drugs two years ago, and estimated that, although 13,500 patients were already on clozapine, there were potentially another 24,000 patients who would be eligible for it. For years, hospitals limited the numbers of patients on the drugs because of the costs, but after the Nice guidance, the numbers rose, and it is thought that nearly 20,000 patients are now on it. </p> <p>Dr David Taylor, chief pharmacist at the Maudsley Hospital in south London whose wife, Jo, is a senior employee of Novartis, recently published an article in the Pharmaceutical Journal outlining why he felt it might be better for hospital trusts to stick with Clorazil, because there was a cost involved in switching systems. </p> <p>He said that for the Maudsley the price differential between the drugs was greatly reduced, because Novartis discounted the price of its drug. 'There is also the small but arguably important risk attached to switching to the new generic drug, and the huge amount of work needed to change to a different system. The scheme that Novartis has in place for monitoring its safety has proved itself for more than 10 years. That is not to say that others do not have sufficient expertise and track record to do the same.' </p> <p><strong>Mind medicines</strong></p> <p>There are two types of anti-psychotic drugs: the older, typical drugs, known as neuroleptics, and the newer, atypical kind such as olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine. </p> <p>The newer ones are recommended because they tend to carry fewer side-effects. Between 0.25 per cent and 1 per cent of the population is thought to have schizophrenia, which is slightly more common in men and peaks in the early twenties. Treating patients costs \u00a31 billion a year, about 3 per cent of all NHS expenditure. </p> <p>Controlling symptoms is very important. They can include hallucinations, delusions and apathy or withdrawal from society. Clozapine is usually given after other drugs have failed to control what is known as treatment-resistant schizophrenia, which affects around 30 per cent of patients. About 20,000 patients are on the drug, but experts believe at least 17,000 more should be.</p>",
  "'David Miliband told so many lies that were he Pinocchio he would be unable to appear in public', says Colin MacCabe in his article on A-level results (Comment, last week). <p>But for someone to be telling a lie it is not a sufficient condition that the arguments that they are advancing are false; it is also necessary that they know them to be false. MacCabe advances no evidence whatsoever for the latter. </p> <p>You describe MacCabe as 'one of our leading academics'. Judging by his complete failure to observe an elementary rule of logical discourse, it is not the standards in A-levels we should be worrying about but the standards in academia.<br><b> David Lipsey</b><br>House of Lords, London, SW1 </p> <p>Contrary to Colin MacCabe's belief, it is not difficult to engage in rational discussion of education if it is located in its social and economic context. </p> <p>The dumbing down of A-levels, the abandonment of traditional university education and the transfer of the cost of education on to the user have to be seen in the context of a neo-liberal agenda which means meeting the needs of finance capital. </p> <p>At the heart of this agenda is the ideology that uses value environments such as education and health can be subjected to the market and can actually produce wealth. </p> <p>The abandonment of traditional university education is carried out by the universities themselves as they ditch subjects such as history, philosophy and science because of cost. At the same time the government wants to promote science. </p> <p>This is the kind of contradiction thrown up by the slavish adherence to the ideology of the market.<br><b> Pat Brady</b><br>Senior lecturer (retired), London Metropolitan University, Chislehurst</p> <p>Heaven help our future HE students if Colin MacCabe is regarded as a leading academic. He asserts that nobody teaching A-levels can believe that they have not been dumbed down - without producing a single shred of evidence for this statement. </p> <p>He criticises the abandoning of A-levels as a competitive exam knowing that (pre 1987) awarding an A grade to the top 14 per cent gave no guarantee to an employer or university of the absolute standard that had been reached compared to past or future cohorts of students. </p> <p>He complains about the introduction to A-levels of continuous assessment alongside final exams - despite this being a method of evaluation long employed by universities on their courses. So why the complaint? </p> <p>He argues about the lack of skills of current students compared to those 'in his day' but fails to recognise, for example, that the IT skills of this generation are hugely superior to the slide rule and Sinclair calculator skills of the MacCabe generation. </p> <p>This emphasises how the world has changed and that the needs of the UK economy now requires a range of skills unimaginable in MacCabe's student days. </p> <p>Skills needs are expanding and are required at increasing levels. The intellectual skills to satisfy the technology and production needs employed in an expanding multi-media world are as important as the academic and practical skills of the archaeologist and history scholar. </p> <p>MacCabe argued that in the past decades universities did not teach skills for existing jobs - thus ignoring scientists, architects, teachers, lawyers, engineers, surveyors and a host of others. The man talks rubbish. </p> <p>Clearly MacCabe wants to move back to a world run by an intellectual elite. The students of today and tomorrow cannot allow his blinkered and flawed thinking to gain credibility otherwise we really will be back debating cave space.<br><b> Kevin Maton</b><br>Coventry </p> <p>MacCabe is right that what used to be called 'manpower planning' has not worked in any industrial society for more than 200 years, yet it is implicit both in the statements by Labour ministers, and in The Observer leader's remark about the 'knowledge economy', that we know how to predict what the economy will 'require' over the next 20-30 years. </p> <p>Not even the Soviet Union could get this right, even though they could order graduates to go to where they were 'required'. A market economy has far less control over such issues, and no real strategy to deal with them. <br><b> Dr Gary Littlejohn</b><br>Bradford, West Yorkshire</p>",
  "<b> Enoch's words </b> <br> <p>Nick Cohen is surely right in his assessment of Enoch Powell's April 1968 Birmingham speech (Comment, last week). However, a slip in the quotation is significant and should be corrected. What Powell said, no doubt with the care that characterised all his writing and speeches, was that ' ... the black man will have the whip hand over the white man ...', not the 'upper hand'.

  "There is a story much beloved by betweeded, gun-toting men standing around their 4x4s on wet winter days. A well-known MP asked his host what gratuity he should give the gamekeeper for his day of shooting pheasant. The owner thought \u00a3100 would be about right, but the MP was outraged. 'A hundred pounds,' he bellowed. 'I want to tip the man, not fuck him.' <p>I think we all know what party he represents. </p> <p>Without slipping too far into the vernacular, the RSPB is currently outraged because a Borders gamekeeper didn't get, ahem, done over. Stephen Muir escaped jail after he admitted poisoning 16 buzzards, one goshawk and a crow. The actual number of birds the investigators found when they went on to the Barns estate near Peebles was 22 buzzards, a tawny owl, a heron, the crow and the goshawk. It was appalling, Scotland's worst wildlife crime. </p> <p>Muir was ordered to pay \u00a35,500, when he could have been sent to jail for six months or fined a total of \u00a385,000. 'It is a high fine so I cannot say the case has not been taken seriously but I do not think it will act as a deterrent until someone is jailed,' said David Dick, the RSPB's investigations officer. He was more infuriated still when Muir's employers didn't sack him on the spot. </p> <p>People in the area showed more sympathy, asking what good it would do jailing the father of two and questioning how he would pay the fine if he lost his \u00a3900-a-month job. The estate has, apparently, begun internal 'disciplinary' procedures, moved Muir to foresting duties and cancelled all commercial shooting for the year. There is the suggestion that, having separated from his wife in 2002, Muir was suffering emotional problems. </p> <p>Is the suggestion that this gamekeeper, angry that his relationship has broken up, was venting his frustration on nature by slaughtering a host of feathered predators? If so, perhaps he should have been jailed for public safety. More likely, Muir saw his job threatened by the birds that kept eating his pheasants and took his duties too far. </p> <p>The RSPB has long fought to get Scotland's sheriffs to take this sort of crime seriously. It is still rightly furious that several of its cases have been thrown out because its evidence was deemed inadmissible as it was gathered surreptitiously on someone else's land, a judgment that begs the question of what would happen if the crime had been against a human. There is also the problem of rural communities protecting their own. Dick points out that egg thieves, invariably from England, are treated far more harshly than gamekeepers. </p> <p>In Muir's case, Dick was asked by the sheriff to stand up and tell the court why killing buzzards was so bad. Yet landowners raise this very request as a sign that the authorities have been cosying up to the RSPB. They believe the charity is vengeful in its protection of raptors, using the vast sums raised from 'thousands of cat-owners who preside over the catastrophic slaughter of songbirds' to try and destroy their way of life. </p> <p>The Scottish Gamekeepers' Association, of which Muir was once a member, believes that the RSPB takes no account of the huge increase in numbers of buzzards which now threaten their pheasant- and partridge-breeding programmes. That Muir could kill 22 buzzards from poisoning one wood suggests they have a point. RSPB figures show the numbers of this, the most common bird of prey, rising at a staggering rate. </p> <p>Dick is happy to admit this, although he says that 'nature abhors a vacuum' and the buzzards were enticed in one after another. He goes further and says that sporting estates are no longer the mainstay of a local economy and their needs should be dismissed because birds of prey are crucial to the new lodestone, tourism. If this is not a battle about class, then it is certainly about a way of life. </p> <p>The trouble is Dick's call for Muir to be sent to jail is actually a return to the days of yore. The gamekeeper, the working man once hated by poachers but now despised by those against bloodsports as the betrayer of their class, is being asked to serve time for attempting to benefit their employer, even if the big house is unaware of their behaviour. This is what confuses the sheriffs, the lack of immediate financial motive by the offender, beyond the urge to do his job. </p> <p>It strikes me that if you want to stop gamekeepers killing birds of prey, you should also fine their bosses for bad land management. That way the crime will cease to benefit the estate. I suspect the loss of cash would also dissipate the paternalism that currently keeps Muir in his job. </p> <p>Meanwhile, whatever you think of Tory MPs and blood-soaked bonhomie, honesty is needed. Gamekeepers need to be heard, their concerns considered, and they shouldn't be sent to jail because the RSPB is surreptitiously beginning the next big battle to end bloodsports. With his joke, the Tory MP revealed his paternalism. I can't help feel that by going after the gamekeepers, the RSPB is demeaning itself by doing the same. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com\">ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Imagine spending hours filling in forms to claim compensation for an endowment that threatens to leave you shouldering a big debt, breathing a sigh of relief when your claim is successful - and then discovering you may have to pay a big tax bill on the money.</p> <p>This is the sad saga unfolding for people caught up in the endowments scandal.</p> <p>The Inland Revenue has confirmed that compensation payments are taxable if they include interest, which is the case with some, but not all, awards.</p> <p>The average payment to endowment mis-selling victims so far has been around \u00a31,600; assuming that \u00a3600 of that is interest, the bill for a basic rate taxpayer is \u00a3120 and for a 40 per cent taxpayer \u00a3240. But payments of \u00a33,000 or more are not unusual, so some people will face much larger bills.</p> <p>And these rules apply to other types of mis-selling compensation payments - for example to split capital investment trusts, where the estimated average loss is around \u00a312,000.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority says that only a minority of people will be liable to tax; the Financial Ombudsman says it affects mainly those who surrendered their policies some time ago rather than those whose policies are still in force. In some cases the endowment companies will have paid the compensation because FSA guidelines suggests that this is an option.</p> <p>The FSA and the Revenue are asking people who are unclear about their position to get in touch with tax offices.</p> <p>Where interest is included in compensation payments it is not surprising that the Inland Revenue has fixed its beady eye on the money. But this is all gobbledegook to endowment investors, especially when one of the big selling-points for endowments was that payouts would be tax free. Politicians and accountants are rallying to the defence of consumers; LibDem Shadow Chancellor Vincent Cable has asked the Revenue to justify its position and the Conservatives' Howard Flight says 'tax decisions should be made clear from the start'.</p> <p>Legislation was enacted to exempt recipients of pensions mis-selling compensation from paying tax. The same treatment must be given to other types of misselling compensation, if only to prevent a deluge of enquiries to beleaguered tax offices from confused and angry mis-selling victims.</p> <p>The relationship between consumers and financial institutions is already strained to the limit.

'Kids hanging out on the street had them on their mobile phones.

  "Russian police confirmed yesterday that traces of explosives had now been found on both of the aircraft which crashed last week, killing 90 people. <p>Two Chechen 'black widow' female suicide bombers are thought to have carried out Tuesday's terror attacks. One of the bombers was motivated by the loss of her brother, who was abducted by Russian troops in Chechnya, it was claimed yesterday. </p> <p>Aminat Nagayeva, 27, who blew herself up on the Tupelov 134 plane bound for Volgograd, was from Kirov-Yurt, a village in the troubled southern region of Vedeno. Much of the current fighting in Chechnya is concentrated around this hilly region, steeped in some of the worst brutalities of the conflict. </p> <p>Yesterday the Izvestiya newspaper quoted Dogman Akhmadov, head of the Kirov-Yurt administration, saying: 'One of Aminat's brothers disappeared three or four years ago. [According to most statements, federal troops] took him away and until now they have heard nothing of him. Now only her mother lives here and her sisters and brothers have gone to Grozny.' </p> <p>Previous suicide bombers identified as the widows or relatives of people abducted or killed in Chechnya have been dubbed 'black widows'. </p> <p>The Russian media yesterday speculated that the two women may be from the part-Turk Nagai ethnic group, who live across the north Caucacus and are purported to have links to the militant Wahhabist branch of Islam. </p> <p>Russian officials said the attackers could have used false or stolen documents to avoid retribution against their families. But a database of casualties maintained by human rights group Memorial refers to the death in May 2001 of Ubais Nagayev, a 22-year-old from Kirov-Yurt. The second war in Chechnya had ended in a Russian victory and 'clean-up operations', in which former rebels or their sympathisers were rounded up and often executed, were reaching their peak. </p> <p>The fate of Ubais Nagayev, whose sister, Aminat, may have been passenger 28 on the fatal flight from Moscow to Volgograd, provides a chilling insight into the cycle of violence in Chechnya. Kirov-Yurt, where Aminat grew up, was the site of more killings three days after her brother's abduction, when men in camouflage uniforms and masks shot dead nine civilians. </p> <p>It is amid this continuing pattern of retribution and killing that Chechens will today vote for a new President. Troops line the streets of the capital, Grozny, cutting off roads in response to intelligence of attacks by separatist militants. Yesterday police tightened security at polling stations, targeted by militants to cut the turnout. </p> <p>Most Chechens consider the vote, held under martial law to elect a successor to Akhmad Kadyrov, who was assassinated in May, a foregone conclusion. Kadyrov was himself elected in conditions which observers said were rife with coercion and ballot-stuffing. </p> <p>Kremlin backing for Chechen interior minister Alu Alkhanov caused many to believe the only vote that matters has already been cast. Yesterday a hairdresser called Allah told The Observer: 'Of course I won't vote. They have already decided who will be President, and it's much safer at home.'</p>",

Until then, however, I don't have the car. </p> <p>So I would take the bus, lovely bus, clean and cheap and sensible, but there's something wrong with me.

Then, before any clammy-handed adolescents could call in, the road went through the Eisenhower Tunnel and the signal was lost. </p> <p>Colorado, where the Great Plains meet the Rockies, is part of the United States of Otherness, the European's disturbing dream of America. Democrat America we like and know well; we visit its cities on the east and west coasts, and its pundits are always on our radios, shaking their heads over George W Bush. But this state is run by the other tribe. In 2000, its eight electoral college votes went to Bush. Colorado has a Republican governor, both its senators are Republicans, and so are five out of its seven congressmen. Here, if anywhere, you can find out who these Republicans are. Radio KRKS seemed to confirm much that a secular Brit had ever worried about. </p> <p>The local Republican chairwoman had invited me to visit her in the city of Leadville, 5,000 feet above even the Mile High City of Denver. Writers had been to this old mining town before. In April 1882, Oscar Wilde gave a lecture on art appreciation at the Tabor Opera House, later remarking that the miners had seemed to think that Botticelli was a drink. After the talk, Wilde was taken on a torchlit parade to the famous Matchless Mine, where he was let down to the silver workings in a bucket. </p> <p>Huge fortunes, such as the Guggenheim family's, were made up here. And lost. The last miner was laid off from the nearby Climax molybdenum mine in the late Eighties. Since then, the residents of Cloud City had been relying on work in the tourist industry, mostly in the nearby resort of Vail. </p> <p>But Leadville, sitting below Mounts Elbert and Massive, must be one of the most beautiful cities in the world and, gradually, wealthier people at the end of their careers have come here to live high up among the log pines. One of the first was Maryellen Thoren, vice-chair of the High Mountain Republican women. She came to pick me up from my bed and breakfast early on a Sunday morning and drove me round town in her large Lincoln. Now in her sixties, she looked like an older Sally Field and lived like The Archers 's Linda Snell on speed. There was hardly a voluntary organisation in the area she didn't help with or hold office in. When they were told I was meeting her, even the taciturn hoteliers I was staying with warmed a little. 'Maryellen,' they said, 'is a great lady.' </p> <p>She didn't start life as a Republican. Her father was a blue-collar worker in Philadelphia, a union man and a Democrat. But as she went through college, Maryellen came to a different view. Having no money, she never attended college during the day, so she took jobs to keep herself and studied in the evenings. It was 1964. 'You know, Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society turned me off. I believed that if you wanted things, then you worked for them. So I supported Goldwater, even though he was a little extreme.' Maryellen became a Republican because she disagreed with welfare - it sapped the incentive to get out there and achieve your dreams. 'We had multi-generational welfare families, where no one worked,' she said. </p> <p>The logic of this might have been the pitiless one of leaving people to pull themselves up, but Maryellen was never a leaver. You should help people, she told me, but through charities and the churches, not government. Having worked for AT&amp;T abroad, Maryellen came home determined to put her skills to good use. At 9am, I went with her to the modern Presbyterian church where she worships. There were 40 or so people in the simple, modern building (the normal congregation is around 70), and the sermon being preached by the plump woman preacher was 'Send me'. 'Here I am, Lord,' went the hymn that accompanied the text. </p> <p>And here, Maryellen was, always ready to be sent. She was (unpaid) vice- principal of the local college. In 1996, she volunteered as an election observer in Bosnia. 'I will tend the poor and lame,' the hymn went on. 'I will set a feast before them', which Maryellen obliquely did, she told me, by getting Leadville connected to the fibre-optics highway so the local economy could diversify and the folks (many of them Hispanics) in the local trailer parks could get jobs. </p> <p>The night before, I had watched a CNN report from Ohio, where workers who had just been made unemployed and who had begun the rapid descent towards trailerdom, were queuing at soup kitchens. For all its volunteering, Maryellen's can be a rough old creed. </p> <p>But clear as she was about welfare, Maryellen was a moderate on everything else. She believed in Christianity by example, not by fire. 'It's about doing what you can to make a difference in the world. The question must always be, \"Can you live with yourself?\"' </p> <p>She regarded such issues as abortion and gay marriage as none of the state's business. Warmly greeted by Maryellen's friends at the church, I was also granted a revelation: that this, rather than the tele-evangelism and Elmer Gantry fundamentalism that we enjoy shuddering about in Europe, was more likely to be the true Republican Christianity. </p> <p>Just after her husband died two months ago, Maryellen's lobbyist son got her a ticket for a huge Washington dinner. She brought back a photograph of herself alongside George Bush. That association alone might be enough to consign her to perdition in the eyes of many readers, but if I were ever in trouble, I'd hope to be somewhere near Maryellen. She was a lovely woman. </p> <p>Democrats still outnumber Republicans in Leadville by more than two to one. On Harrison, the main street, I found the office of Marcia Martinek, editor of the Leadville Herald Democrat (established 1879). Her political origins were similar to Maryellen's. She was a registered Republican and her late husband had been the Republican sheriff in Colorado's Arapahoe county. </p> <p>'I became a Republican because I didn't like putting more and more money into welfare, where people got paid for every extra child they gave birth to out of wedlock,' Marcia said. And then, sounding like Gordon Brown: 'It would be better to provide daycare, so that single moms can work.' </p> <p>But Marcia hadn't voted for Bush in 2000 and isn't about to in 2004. She didn't like the social stance. 'You know, it's hard to be Republican and to be a woman too,' she told me. She felt that some women were slipping back into traditional domestic roles, prevented from achieving more. And then there was Iraq. Her stepson, a strong Bush supporter, had been in Falluja with the 1st Infantry. Now he was coming home, but Marcia wondered why he had gone in the first place. 'What did the President know, what did the President not know about WMD? Was it justified?' </p> <p>Iraq and security still seem to play for Bush. On the scenic train to Climax, built along the side of the mountain because a rival line had been built along the valley, I met Glynn and Connie, from Fort Collins. They were thinking of moving to the mountains because the foothills were getting too crowded. Glynn was very reluctant to talk about politics. 'Once, it was all quite simple, but it's all global now. Even the CIA doesn't understand the world, so how can we?' This same analysis made Connie want to stick by Bush. 'The world is a scary place, isn't it? I just think we should keep the man who's been through the fire. Right now, you don't want to change horses in midstream.' </p> <p>While we were speaking, 500 runners had been taking part in an insane race. The Leadville 100 ('The Race Across the Sky') is a 100-mile trail run that takes a day and a night to complete. So next day, in the 6th Street gym, they were celebrating the achievement of the 196 who had finished within the regulation 30 hours. There was not a polyester moose in sight as Ken Chlouber, a former miner, current Republican State Senator and founder of the Leadville 100, handed out the gongs. Back in 1982, Chlouber was the first Republican elected here in 30 years. Now, in his stetson and shoelace tie, he is a local landmark. I told him I was a journalist from Britain and congratulated him on the race. 'Well,' he said politically, 'it's folks like you who make it what it is.' I told him I didn't think so. </p> <p>Chlouber marked a trend. With the unions gone and retired people and second-home owners moving in, the political character of the area has changed. It's only 16 years since a Colorado senator, Gary Hart, was a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, before he was tripped up for premature Clintonism. It seems longer. </p> <p>Standing next to Chlouber, with long grey hair, a print dress and the air of rosy purposefulness of a Liberal Democrat councillor, was the woman who had asked me up here, Merilee O'Neal, chairwoman of Lake County Republicans. As you read this, Merilee will be arriving in New York for the Republican convention, which starts tomorrow. Last Sunday, she was co-organiser of the Leadvillle 100. This evening, the Colorado delegates have all got Broadway tickets for The Phantom of the Opera . </p> <p>Merilee was looking forward to New York. 'It's a great moment,' she beamed, 'being part of history. You know, David, I love George Bush, I love his parents, I love his wife. I respect all of them.' </p> <p>Like Maryellen, she had been born into a Democratic family. Her father had been a small rancher in Gruver, Texas. 'He was a very conservative Democrat,' she told me, of the kind who no longer exists. She described herself, in what was to become a model formula, as 'fiscally conservative and socially moderate'. And she didn't like the Christian right, whom she felt had more loyalty to their own ideology than to the party. 'It does bother me,' she admitted, 'that there are single-issue party people who'd rather lose an election than compromise. But you know, it's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease, David. They get the attention.' In fact, Merilee felt that she had much in common with some Democrats. She had watched their convention and thought that many of them had sounded just like Republicans! </p> <p>So, as I headed down the mountain again, I listened to KRKS in a different way. First off, it's one radio station among dozens; then, how is the mom seeking advice on how to teach her 10-year-old daughter about purity and not flaunting her body, very different from a Muslim parent advocating the hijab? None of it necessarily means that the clock is about to be turned back to pre-feminism. These Republican women would never allow it. </p> <p>Colorado is not just Republican, it's also the future. The state is growing rapidly. What they call the 'front range', the strip beside the mountains from Fort Collins in the north to Pueblo in the south, is seeing the highest population growth in the United States; 10,000 newcomers arrive to live in Colorado every month, drawn by the beauty, the climate, the trails and the rivers. In the middle is Denver and it is there, in its rejuvenated downtown, near Union Station, that I meet Mike Nelligan, chair of Denver Metro County Republians. </p> <p>Mike is tall, rangy and shrewd, a semi-retired businessman who became politically active three or four years ago. And, another blow to prejudice this, he is absolutely delightful. 'Yes, Colorado is becoming more Republican,' he says. And adds, rather complacently: 'The people who come here tend to be more successful and more successful people tend to vote Republican.' Mike makes an easy equation of aspiration with Republicanism which, if the electorate believes it, could be lethal for the Democrats. But, in fact, a large proportion of the immigrants are Hispanic, who are not traditionally on the right. What does Mike make of them? 'Well, they either can't speak the language or don't vote. But if they did, they could change everything.' </p> <p>We drive off. The mountains are on the right, so we head south, to a development called Highland Ranch, a new town of 75,000 inhabitants. 'It's the kind of place we call the \"calving pens\",' Mike laughs. 'It's a pre-planned development where the 25-50s come to have their kids. The schools are here, the shopping malls, the churches...' </p> <p>Speaking of which, how important does he feel the Christian right is? 'You know, they're more adamant. They turn out to vote. Pro-choice people are more comme \u00e7i, comme \u00e7a - \"Maybe I'll vote, maybe I won't\". So it's a constant battle at the state level as to who is going to win the chairmanship and what's going in the policy platform.' </p> <p>Mike is a business Republican - pro-choice and not that keen on guns. Earlier this month, Colorado Republicanism was convulsed by the struggle for the nomination for a vacant senatorial post between a local congressman who was backed by the strong fundamentalist wing, based in Colorado Springs, and a man they referred to as the 'alcohol magnate', multi-millionaire Pete Coors. Coors, a neophyte, won, but it was a nasty fight, in which he was accused of liquoring up the state's notoriously drink-prone youth, and of funding abortions through his company's employee health insurance scheme. Pathetically he announced an end to the health funding for abortions. </p> <p>It is Coors we have come to see. His HQ is in Highland Ranch, as is the HQ of the Colorado Bush-Cheney campaign. There I meet Barbara DeGroot, glamorous, somewhere-over-50, chair of the Denver Bush-Cheney campaign and good friend of Mike's. It is Barbara who has procured the interview. Pictures of volunteers cover the walls and a halo of tinsel surrounds the notice that Beth Itchkawich is volunteer of the month. Young Corey, just out of college, shakes my hand. 'Are you really from London? Your Tony Blair, we think he's awesome. He stood by us and we will never forget it!' </p> <p>I don't like to tell him that simply by repeating his words, I have probably cost Blair another hundred votes. James and Shirley Ball from Fort Logan are there to collect new yard-signs, he in his USS Lincoln baseball cap and she in her 'All-American Mom' sweatshirt. Their old Bush-Cheney signs have all been stolen. 'We've lived there since 1963 and we've never had any trouble until now,' says James. 'Things are getting a bit nasty.' </p> <p>The alcohol magnate is Munster-tall, handsome, red-faced and courteous. I had seen one of his TV ads the night before. In 15 seconds, he had said: 'I'm Pete Coors and I'm in favour of low taxes, our troops and the family, so vote for me.' During the primaries, Coors had been forced to trim to the right to get the activist vote. Then he was accused of being woolly and uncomfortable; now he's more definite and even more uncomfortable, as though playing a role he is unsuited for. 'I'm pro-life,' he tells me emphatically and unconvincingly, 'and against gay marriage. I'm a tax-cutting, middle-of-the-road Republican.' </p> <p>How pro-life is he? 'Life starts at conception. The unborn are unable to speak for themselves; we have to speak for them.' Then, glibly, he bites this sound. 'Abortion is elective surgery, like a facelift, except involving life.' And there are other options, such as adoption. His brother adopted five children from other countries. The successful businessman delivers himself of an embarrassing inanity. 'We don't know who the next great scientist, the next Einstein, is going to be. It could be someone who is about to be aborted.' Or it could be the next mass murderer or the next nudnik. Double-doh. </p> <p>Despite this insulting nonsense (does the candidate really believe that women have abortions for essentially cosmetic reasons?), I don't think Coors has the stomach for banning terminations. For one thing, his firmest supporters simply don't agree. After the interview, Mike, Barbara and I drink iced tea at the Cherry Hills Country Club, looking across a sunny golf course towards Mount Evans. </p> <p>I ask Barbara about Coors, whom she likes. 'You know,' she replies diplomatically, 'I do think people need to have a choice.' Mike adds: 'Yes, what if a child has a severe handicap? Sometimes, you can't tell 'til late.' And Barbara drops a bombshell. Her 24-year-old daughter is pregnant, but: 'She was on drugs, you know, David. She's 23 weeks into the pregnancy and if she finds that the child is affected... well it's her choice.' Well, not if her candidate for the Senate has his way, but she doesn't expect him to. His professed certainty collides with the way people really are, and Republicans are about the way people really are. </p> <p>That same day, in Iowa, the Vice-President, Dick Cheney, whose daughter is gay, distanced himself from Bush's stand on homosexual marriage. 'Freedom,' said Cheney, 'means freedom for everyone to enter into the relations they want.' Also that day, the Republican policy committee, headed by Colorado governor Bill Owens, drew up its draft platform seeking to prevent gay marriage. Mike's view was that you said these things to get the Christian activists onside and then, once elected, found reasons not to do them. Mike and Barbara understand that rugged individualism sits badly with moral determinism. </p> <p>The following morning, we drive through the suburbs, taking note of one low, beige building in a lovely location. It's a school and a boy sits outside, basking in the sun. Later, it's on to a meeting of the Denver Young Republicans in a Mexican restaurant south-east of the city. There are 50 youngish Republicans there and the main speech, given by a state senator, and all the talk, is about economic issues - taxation, education spending and health finance. In addition to the presidential and senatorial elections, November will see contests for state representatives. David Sprecace, dark and intense, is standing in District 3. His manifesto declares him to be a 'social mainstream, fiscal conservative'. So what does he make of the current national budget deficit? 'I hate it.' So what will he do about it? 'What can I do? Write to my congressman?' In any case (they all say), it would be worse under the Democrats. </p> <p>Even so, fiscal conservatives like Sprecace are increasingly worried by Bush. There's not just the deficit, there's also No Child Left Behind, Bush's New Deal-type policy of more money for schools and more federal intervention. There are anti-business ideological stances like that on stem cell research, where countries such as Britain look set to make up for what they have lost over genetic modification. One man I speak to, who recently held the GM portfolio at the US embassy in London, is very miffed at this thwarted opportunity. </p> <p>And for some, there's the problem of the state powers garnered by Attorney General John Ashcroft as part of the war on terror. One young Republican tells me that he is, for the moment, prepared to put up with all this statism. 'At least,' he tells me, 'I feel secure from terror here in Denver.' I contemplate reminding him that, out here in the Midwest, the threats come from elsewhere. That beige building I had seen earlier was Columbine High School. </p> <p>Judging from Colorado, the Republicans, though they may seem set to inherit the future, are in just as awkward a coalition as the Democrats, though sometimes more disciplined. The Christian right and the numerically greater economic Republicans will only coexist if the former don't push too hard. There are plenty of contradictions and one remarkable problem. In this gathering of Republican youth there is not one single black or Hispanic face. And although there are nearly as many women as men, this does not stop one of the officers making a speech referring to 'young Republicans, their wives and girlfriends'. </p> <p>Mike, a clever, insightful and humane man, sees it. He says the election will be tight and turn on swing voters in key states, few enough that the politicians 'know them by their first names'. And they are up for grabs. Back at the hotel, I tune into public-service channel C-Span and see John Kerry make a speech in New York. To my European ears, it's a good one.</p>",
  "<p>The heads of senior executives at British Airways are on the block after last week's disastrous spate of delays and cancellations at London's Heathrow airport.</p> <p>Rod Eddington, the airline's chief executive, has initiated a 'postmortem' investigation into the way the crisis was handled. He is thought to have identified at least two top executives who should bear responsibility for the chaos, which tarnished BA's reputation and led to misery for thousands of passengers. </p> <p>Eddington would not comment on which senior managers would take the blame for the cancellations, which resulted from a combination of inadequate staffing, bad weather and technical problems. 'This week we will begin to see what the reputational implications are, and how we might recover from it. We've got a small group working on it,' he said. </p> <p>However, it is believed that Mervyn Walker, director of UK airports, and Peter Read, operations executive, may be in the firing line over last week's failures. </p> <p>Eddington said that it would be 'in the next few months that our customers will judge us. It will be the next time, and the time after that, that they get on a BA plane - so we'll have to make sure they judge us properly.' </p> <p>The BA boss said that there was 'no evidence' that the chaos was connected with the recent industrial troubles at the airline, which saw a threatened strike - timed for this bank holiday weekend - called off after late-night talks a week ago. 'We know the vast majority of the workforce was happy with the settlement.' </p> <p>Problems began during the day on Monday, he explained, with the closure of air traffic control systems during a severe thunderstorm over south east England. It was compounded by technical difficulties, which Eddington insisted were not security-related, and made worse by staff shortages at Heathrow. </p> <p>'We have 200 new staff going through the training machinery, which shows we can get the staff. But they were not ready in time. It takes so much longer to do full vetting now,' he said. </p> <p>'There was great relief and satisfaction that we settled the strike, then just 48 hours afterwards we snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. We just didn't have the right numbers at Heathrow.' </p> <p>But he dismissed suggestions that he might be ready to quit: 'BA is here to stay, and it's my job to return it to being a strong global competitor.' </p> <p>Walker, a long-serving BA employee, was in charge of negotiations last year that settled the 'swipe-card' strike after serious disruptions to BA's services. He was legal adviser to BA during the 'dirty tricks' scandal of the early Nineties, when Sir Richard Branson won a humiliating court apology from the airline.</p>",
  "George Bush will take the stage at the Republican convention in New York this week to launch a last desperate fight for the White House. With two months to go, one of the bitterest and tightest elections in American history is now in its final stages. <p>The President is ready for the battle. 'I am not going to come in second place,' he told USA Today last week in a rare interview. But New York is not a welcoming place for Bush and the Republicans. </p> <p>The atmosphere is tense in 'the city that never sleeps'. Roads are closed and anti-terrorist measures have New York in a vice-like grip. Many local people have fled to calmer climes. </p> <p>Already several hundred arrests have been made by the thousands of police swamping the streets. With up to 250,000 protesters expected to march against the President and his policies today, the convention could become a symbol of America's division rather than Republican unity. </p> <p>Things are not going to plan for America's 43rd President. A year ago Bush was expected to be invincible; instead he is fighting for his political future. Last week a devastating, dirty campaign against his Democratic opponent John Kerry's Vietnam record continued unabated. Shadowy groups, funded by Republicans close to Bush, have chipped away at Kerry's heroic Vietnam image, but the fight is far from won. </p> <p>The President's supporters are gathering for what they had hoped would be a victory party against a hopeless opponent. Instead Bush finds himself in a neck-and-neck race. </p> <p>The violence in Iraq is dragging on and the milestone of the 1,000th US soldier to die there looms closer with each flag-draped coffin returning home. The economic recovery has stalled, with Bush presiding over a huge loss of jobs. </p> <p>In the swing states things are falling apart. If the election were held tomorrow, many experts believe Kerry would win. The Republican advantage in fundraising has evaporated. Kerry matches Bush dollar for dollar. </p> <p>There are signs of trouble across the country. A recent rally of war veterans in the Republican stronghold of Cincinnati in the key battleground state of Ohio should have been a happy home for Bush. He exhorted the thousands packing the hall to stick by him, launching a muscular defence of the Iraq invasion: 'America is safer today because Saddam Hussein sits in a prison cell.' </p> <p>Veteran Eugene Watkins said: 'I favour Bush,' but Iraq rankled with him so he paused and added: 'I might change my mind.' </p> <p>As a man in the crowd tried to start a chorus of 'Four more years!', the cry fell flat. Only a few voices replied and the chant quickly died out. </p> <p>In the distance the skyscrapers of Philadelphia gleamed in the haze. But in the sprawling Boeing plant in the industrial suburb of Ridley Park the focus was not on the horizon, but on Bush. With a backdrop of two Chinook helicopters, fresh off the assembly lines, he pitched to one of the core constituencies of swing states such as Pennsylvania: workers. </p> <p>They go to the heart of one of the defining issues of the campaign in the swing states: jobs. In Ohio alone 250,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared. To political experts the economy is one thing that cannot be faked by campaign promises. People know if they have a job or not. It was this that destroyed Bush's father's campaign in 1992. Bush Junior is determined not to repeat the mistake. </p> <p>'I understand there's still people looking for work here in America,' the President told thousands of Boeing workers and their families, adding: 'So long as anybody wants to work and can't find a job, I know we've got more work to do in Washington.' </p> <p>Certainly Bush pulled in a crowd, but many were drawn by his celebrity, not his politics. Susan Adomanis brought her young daughter to see the President, but said firmly: 'I am pro-Kerry. He's better on things like education and the economy.' </p> <p>Bush wanted to change her mind. Pennsylvania is a key state, and he has been here 31 times. The state has moved strongly to Kerry in the polls. It is the same all over the swing states. In Ohio, Kerry was ahead of Bush by 9 per cent. In Florida, decided by a few hundred contested votes in 2000, Kerry leads by 6 per cent. </p> <p>The Boeing plant highlighted another key election factor: Iraq. Ridley Park churns out military helicopters. Bush praised the workers for their war role. It was a naked pitch to patriotism. 'We're depending on the people here,' he said to cheers. </p> <p>It is not the war in Iraq that is Bush's main campaign theme, however, it is the 'war on terror'. Across the American heartland, his message is the same: America is fighting a deadly enemy, peril is everywhere, trust me to protect you. </p> <p>The wealthy resort of Traverse City in northern Michigan, acclaimed for its cherry orchards, does not seem a place at war. But Bush told thousands of its carefully corralled citizens they were in danger. His language about terrorists was blunt. 'You cannot negotiate with these killers,' he said. His answer was simple. Fight them. 'We will engage these enemies around the world, so we do not have to face them here at home.' The crowd cheered. </p> <p>Terror is the key. Bush warned Traverse City the world faced disaster if he did not win. 'If we show uncertainty and weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.' </p> <p>The President painted Kerry as unprepared to defend America. Kerry was a man of negotiation, Bush said, while he offered deeds, not words. 'I wake every day thinking how better to protect our country. I will never relent in defending America, whatever it takes.' </p> <p>Another theme is God. In Traverse City, Bush outlined a vision of freedom spreading across the world - not a political ideology but a religious calling. 'Freedom is not America's gift to the world. Freedom is the Almighty God's gift to every man and woman in this world.'. </p> <p>Unlike Kerry, Bush wears his faith comfortably, holding prayer meetings in the White House and getting advice from clerics. </p> <p>Bush's faith humanises him in a way Kerry can only dream about. It is coupled with a folksy style, simple moral values, as well as a sense of comic timing and an arsenal of jokes that pepper his speeches. </p> <p>He lampoons Kerry's praise of Hollywood's 'heart and soul', telling each crowd that the true heart and soul of America is their home town. </p> <p>All this is backed by a straitjacket of media control. Crowds are carefully vetted, questions screened. The Republican 'war room' in Virginia issues devastating attacks and rebuttals. On the campaign trail journalists are herded from press pen to press pen to watch the same speech. Questions are often referred to headquarters. </p> <p>Kerry's campaign is a contrast. The candidate often chats to reporters, as Bush did in 2000 when he won a reputation for off-the-record talks. Now it is different, partly because he is President, but mostly because of the desire for control. This election is too important for mistakes. </p> <p>In West Virginia it was working. On a high-school football field in the small town of Hedgesville thou sands came to see Bush. There was a buzz of anticipation. This was Bush country. You could see this in the people lining the roads and the yellow ribbons tied to trees. The Hedgesville gathering felt like a revivalist meeting. They came to hear Bush talk of terror and God. 'Morals are the most important way to judge a life. George Bush is a good man,' said Mary Kate Moore, wife of a local church minister. </p> <p>This was not a good place to be a Democrat. One man, Glenn Hiller, heckled Bush about jobs and was quickly removed as the audience shouted abuse. Later Hiller was fired from his job. </p> <p>Bush gave a personal account of the impact of 9/11, the defining event of his presidency. The wars it triggered, from Kabul to Baghdad to the 'war on terror', have defined this election. </p> <p>He talked of speaking to rescue workers in the ruins of the World Trade Centre: 'A guy looked me in the eye and said, \"Do not let me down\". He took that day personally. The people searching the rubble took it personally. You took it personally, and so did I.' </p> <p>'That's right!' yelled several people. As he concluded, Bush pledged: 'God bless you. We're on our way to victory.' </p> <p>The audience roared their approval. If Bush is right, God and terror will win him the election - an outcome also predicted by the crowd. 'Four more years!' they chorused. 'Four more years!'</p>",
  "Greg Dyke, former director-general of the BBC, today lays bare the astonishing inside story of the war waged by the Prime Minister and Downing Street against the BBC over its coverage of the Iraq war and the controversial issue of weapons of mass destruction. <p>In an explosive autobiography which returns the corrosive issue of Iraq to the heart of political debate, Dyke reveals that Tony Blair wrote an unprecedented letter to him and Gavyn Davies, the former BBC chairman, trying to force the corporation to change the tone of its coverage. </p> <p>In the extracts serialised in The Observer today, Dyke reveals: <br><b>\u00b7</b> That he believes Blair reneged on a deal not to call for 'heads to roll' at the BBC. <br><b>\u00b7</b> That he believes Alastair Campbell, the former Number 10 director of communications, was forced out by Blair for being 'out of control'. <br><b>\u00b7</b> That six still-serving BBC governors should resign over their part in the affair. </p> <p>The disclosures, which will reignite the row between the BBC and the government, will again raise the question of trust which has dogged the Prime Minister since the WMD row first surfaced. It is unheard of for a serving Prime Minister to write to the head of Britain's public service broadcaster. Dyke, who says the move was intimidatory, claims Blair later regretted sending the letter, but was persuaded to by Campbell. </p> <p>Dyke says Campbell had become 'obsessed' with trying to 'beat' the BBC, was out of control, vindictive and eventually had to be removed by the Prime Minister. </p> <p>The book, Inside Story, also claims that Blair broke a promise to Davies that he would not demand the resignations of either himself or Dyke following publication of the Hutton Report. </p> <p>The Hutton inquiry was set up after the death of David Kelly, the government scientist linked to claims on the Today programme that Downing Street had 'sexed up' intelligence to make a stronger case for war. </p> <p>Both Davies and Dyke left the BBC within 36 hours of the report's appearance, after Campbell accused the corporation of lying in an officially sanctioned statement. </p> <p>The book reveals that the BBC was baffled when Hutton said the government was not guilty of the 'sexing up' claims. Dyke's book quotes a comment by Philip Gould, one of Blair's closest allies and advisers, by way of explanation, alleging that he told a Labour peer: 'Don't worry, we appointed the right judge.' </p> <p>Dyke says a number of governors should resign after capitulating to political pressure. He accuses Blair of allowing Number 10 to produce 'mountains of untruth' in two dossiers published by the government to justify going to war. He said Downing Street started using techniques similar to those of Nixon's White House to smear those seen as being against the interests of the government. </p> <p>'The charge against Blair is damning,' Dyke says. 'He was either incompetent and took Britain to war on a misunderstanding, or he lied when he told the House of Commons that he didn't know what the 45-minute claim meant. </p> <p>'We were all duped. History will not be on Blair's side, it will show that the whole saga is a great political scandal.' </p> <p>The book also reveals fresh doubts at the very top of the intelligence services about claims that Saddam Hussein was an international threat. </p> <p>Dyke says John Scarlett, former head of the Joint Intelligence Committee who was promoted by Blair to head of MI6, had professed private doubts to a BBC journalist about the case for war. In particular, he was concerned by claims that Saddam could launch a chemical or biological weapons attack within 45 minutes of an order to do so. </p> <p>'At the BBC, we knew he [Scarlett] was uncomfortable with the public case being made for the war because that is what he had told one journalist on a bench in the grounds of Ditchley Park, the exclusive Oxfordshire house used as a centre for high level discussions on international affairs. Scarlett told the journalist he was particularly worried about how the dossier had been interpreted in the press.' </p> <p>Dyke says he was forced out after the governors failed to back him following Hutton. He argues that the six governors who voted for him to go, including the former chairman of the JIC, Dame Pauline Neville-Jones, should resign because they 'bowed to political pressure' and damaged the BBC's standing. </p> <p>He also reveals that when the BBC did finally apologise after Dyke had quit, they first checked the statement with Number 10. </p> <p>'I had no idea I would be fired by a board of governors behaving like frightened rabbits caught in car headlights,' Dyke says. 'The new BBC chairman, Michael Grade, needs better, more knowledgeable, governors to support him. There is no greater betrayal of BBC principles than to fold under political pressure, particularly from the government of the day.' </p> <p>Blair's letter, revealed for the first time, to Davies and Dyke was sent on 19 March, 2003, a week before the war in Iraq started. </p> <p>'It seems to me there has been a real breakdown of the separation of news and comment,' the Prime Minister wrote. 'I believe, and I am not alone in believing, that you have not got the balance right between support and dissent; between news and comment; between the voices of the Iraqi regime and the voices of Iraqi dissidents; or between the diplomatic support we have, and diplomatic opposition.' </p> <p>Dyke says he sent back a robust response. </p> <p>'My view was straightforward: if the government was going to try to bully the BBC, then I was going to fight back,' Dyke says in the book. </p> <p>After Kelly's death, the government further tried to turn the screw, with one Cabinet minister briefing journalists that 'the problem with the BBC was too much money and Greg Dyke'. The minister also spoke of 'revenge'. </p> <p>Dyke wrote to Blair saying the attack was a 'blatant threat to the funding and editorial independence of the BBC from a member of your Cabinet'. </p> <p>He initially thought that he could sit out the post-Hutton storm because of a private pledge the Prime Minister had made to Davies. </p> <p>'I knew Blair had told Gavyn in a private telephone conversation that, whatever happened, Number 10 would not be calling on either Gavyn or me to go,' Dyke says. 'When we watched Blair in the Commons [following the Hutton publication] Gavyn realised the Prime Minister had gone back on his word.'</p>",
  "An Iraqi militant group has kidnapped two French journalists and given the French government 48 hours to end a ban on schoolgirls wearing Muslim headscarves. <p>The Arab television station Al-Jazeera yesterday showed a brief video of two men it identified as George Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot in front of a black banner bearing the name of the Islamic Army in Iraq. </p> <p>The station did not say whether the group threatened to kill the two if its ultimatum was not met. </p> <p>A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said it had learnt of the men's capture and ultimatum from the Al-Jazeera video and was trying to analyse the information. </p> <p>The kidnapping comes as the autumn term begins in French schools. Despite appeals for calm from religious leaders, teachers are braced for a wave of tension as schools implement the new and controversial legislation banning the wearing of Islamic headscarves and other conspicuous religious symbols. </p> <p>A hotline was launched by Muslim pressure groups last week, advising students on how to circumvent the legislation discreetly. Although officials claim that fewer than 100 pupils plan to defy the law, the government has warned that radical Islamist organisations are using young pupils as pawns in order to provoke confrontation. </p> <p>After months of national debate, the government ruled in February that from Wednesday any pupil who arrives at school wearing a headscarf, skull cap, turban, large cross or any other piece of ostentatious religious insignia will not be allowed to attend classes. Repeated violations will lead to expulsion. </p> <p>Pupils wondering whether to conform to the ban will be able to consult a free advice line, set up by the Union of French Islamic Organisations, which opposed the law. Volunteers offer confidential suggestions on how to get around the legislation by wearing discreet bandanas instead of full-scale headscarves, and advice on what to do if a school initiates disciplinary procedures. </p> <p>'We are not calling for the law to be broken,' said Noora, one of the hotline's operators. 'But we will tell girls that they may be able to get away with wearing a small, discreet triangle of material pushed far back on their heads.' </p> <p>Much time has been devoted to how to define a headscarf as a sign of religious affiliation. Education minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon said the government would be unflinching. 'There will be no concessions in the way the law is implemented, no matter what attempts are made to circumvent it,' he said. </p> <p>'But there will be dialogue between those pupils concerned, their families and their teachers with one objective: to make sure that children continue to be educated within the confines of the law.' </p> <p>Sania, 17, who is about to enter her final year of school in Strasbourg, stressed that she would turn up at school wearing a headscarf. 'Teachers and friends have been understanding about my decision to wear the veil for the past seven years, and I hope they will continue to be sympathetic,' she said. 'Maybe we will be able to compromise eventually on the acceptability of a small bonnet or a bandana, instead. If not, I risk missing the final and most important year of my education.' </p> <p>Much more than simply a debate over what pupils should wear when they go to school, some see the law as the latest attempt to marginalise France's five million Muslims, as an infringement of human rights, or an example of religious intolerance. </p> <p>Others defend it as crucial element of the republican system, or as a vital protection of young women against a repressive symbol forced on them by a male-dominated society.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of men in the UK are suffering in silence from potentially life-threatening eating disorders because they are too embarrassed to seek treatment for what is still regarded as a women's illness. </p> <p>Experts believe the number of males with anorexia or bulimia could be twice as high as previously thought. Many male sufferers, they say, just learn to structure their lives around the illness and never get adequate treatment. </p> <p>Research from the Eating Disorders Association indicates that one in 10 of the estimated two million people in the UK suffering from anorexia or bulimia is male. </p> <p>However, a spokesman said he believed the true figure was at least double that. </p> <p>'I think this is very much a hidden problem,' said Steve Bloomfield of the EDA. 'It is still seen as a girly disorder. It has a lot of stigma attached. On top of that, men don't like going to their doctor unless a limb is hanging off. </p> <p>'If they do go to their GP, it can often be very difficult to get the problem diagnosed because they tend to have a lot of muscle mass and may not reveal how much exercise they do. The doctor may well look for a virus or some other problem rather than considering an eating disorder.' </p> <p>Bloomfield is concerned about a lack of treatment facilities available for men. </p> <p>'In most units, at least 90 per cent of the patients are female and it can be very difficult, for both sexes, if a man joins the group. The fact that males tend not to respond so comfortably to talking therapy adds to the problem.' </p> <p>Last week, a survey by the Priory Group suggested that Britons' relationship with food seemed to be getting worse rather than better, with the majority of people eating for emotional rather than physical reasons. </p> <p>Of the men surveyed, 42 per cent said they were unhappy with their weight, 16 per cent said they felt guilty after eating and more than one in five thought they would be happier if they were thinner. </p> <p>Peter Rowan, consultant psychiatrist in charge of the eating disorders unit at the Priory hospital in Roehampton, south London, said while the illness was becoming more common, men remained reluctant to seek treatment. </p> <p>'I think there are quite a number of men with eating disorders who never go for treatment but simply learn to live with them. They will not have strictly normal eating habits, they over-exercise and rigidly eliminate fat from their diet. They will often be really quite thin and motivated to the extreme by health information. </p> <p>'Sometimes they end up with these problems as a result of marital difficulties. At other times, their behaviour can cause marital problems, especially if they try to impose their own, rather odd eating habits on other members of the family, particularly children growing up.' </p> <p><strong>Simon's story</strong></p> <p>After he split up from his girlfriend of seven years, Simon decided he desperately wanted to change himself. Then 26, he thought altering his personality was too big a challenge. Instead, he focused on his body. He started going to the gym three times a day. Despite his 6ft 4in frame, he was surviving on an apple for breakfast, a tin of tuna fish for lunch and a bunch of grapes as his evening meal. </p> <p>'It just got completely out of control,' he says. </p> <p>Simon is now 30 and a patient at the Priory clinic in Glasgow. He entered treatment after having seizures because his potassium levels were dangerously low. </p> <p>'Like most people who try to improve their body image, I think I was compensating for the fact that I didn't like myself very much. My self-esteem was really low. </p> <p>'Had I not entered treatment, I would have spent the rest of my life in a useless and painful battle with food, exercise and body image.'</p>",
  "As the rain battered Fistral beach in Newquay on Friday the surfers remained undeterred. They pulled on their wetsuits and carried their boards down to the sea. Surf schools continue regardless of stormy weather. <p>I watched from a distance. It was surprising that the cars parked along the roads were empty. I had been told they would be full of 'surf widows', girlfriends who wait patiently while their partners brave the waves. But they have got bored of sitting on the sidelines. The traditionally male-dominated sport is being hijacked by women, with tens of thousands taking it up. </p> <p>As the rain seeped away and the sun began to shine, the sight was amazing. The water was like the M25 at rush hour, with surfers and bodyboarders packed bumper to bumper, all waiting for the perfect wave. Taking a deep breath, I pulled on my wetsuit and went to join them. </p> <p>The beginners were trying - many in vain - to stand upright on their boards on the frothy white waves near the beach. Further away I could see more experienced surfers sliding across the green waves and turning expertly. That was my aim. But this was my first attempt and it was not going to happen in one hour. </p> <p>My teacher was Sarah Bentley, one of two female surfers on the British surf team. Petite and blonde, she was not what I expected a typical surf champion to look like, but this sport was full of surprises. </p> <p>After a beach demonstration we ventured out. Close up, the hardened army of surfers were different to the stereotypical image I had. There were only a scattering of men with bleached blond hair, tanned limbs, wraparound sunglasses and a tendency to drop 'dude' into every sentence. And there were rows of women. </p> <p>'Surfing is the new girls' night out,' says Kate Hampton, 29, who has been hooked since she first got on a board last year. 'It has always been such a male sport, but not any more.' </p> <p>The environmental consultant, from London, is having lessons at Walking On Waves, a school in Saunton Sands, north Devon, set up this Easter by one of Britain's top female surfers, Sarah Whiteley. It specialises in teaching women. </p> <p>Schools such as Whiteley's meet the unprecedented increase in beginner surfers, in particular women. In just two years the numbers of women surfing has shot up by almost 300 per cent. Conservative estimates by the British Surfing Association (BSA) suggest there are more than 300,000 surfers in the UK. One in four - 75,000 - are women, compared to 20,000 two years ago. </p> <p>On my journey to Newquay the train was packed with women, some with their own boards. There were two groups of girls who had just collected their GCSE results - their reward was learning to surf, an activity which is seen as the ultimate in cool. The town is also becoming a magnet for hen weekends, which combine boozy nights out with days on the surf. I wanted to get in on the act. </p> <p>Lying on my huge, spongy beginner's board, facing the beach and knowing that at any second a wave would hit me from behind and shoot me forward at speed, was exhilarating. When the wave did hit, it felt like I was flying. The difficult bit was getting from a comfortable bellyflop position to my feet. </p> <p>When you surf well they say you are 'ripping'. The closest I came to a rip was snagging my wet-suit as I catapulted head first into the water - but I had a ball trying. </p> <p>Bentley demonstrated how to stand up - arching her back into yoga's 'cobra' position - and then smoothly snaking her body up to a perfect stance. My attempts were far less graceful. The one time I balanced well was when the surf board was lying firmly on the sand. </p> <p>The water was a different story: I fell off backwards, forwards and sideways while salt water gushed up my nose. Nevertheless the attempts were exciting and, finally, I stood up. </p> <p>But as I did I was so overcome with joy at my tiny success that I lifted my hands up and toppled forward. </p> <p>A second later I was lying face down in the water and being dragged along by my board which was attached to my foot. It was a similar story from then on - like a yo-yo I was up and down. </p> <p>But it was not embarrassing and there was no pressure at all. With so many women around the atmosphere was clearly encouraging, rather than competitive. </p> <p>Some had been inspired by Cameron Diaz who has been pictured out-surfing boyfriend Justin Timberlake. Covering her flawless figure in just a skimpy bikini, Diaz looked a picture of grace on a board and showed how feminine the sport can be. </p> <p>Add to that the inspiration of female British surfing success stories - Robyn Davies, Kay Holt, Whiteley and Bentley, to name a few, and films such as Blue Crush that have focused on female surfers. </p> <p>Surf brands are also aiding the boom as they capitalise on the immense growth in women's 'surf fashion', snapping up girls as young as 12 to sponsor and promote women-only events. </p> <p>One surf magazine, Carve, has launched Surf-girl, a magazine dedicated to women in the sport, and there are female-only schools, weekend camps and holidays starting this year. </p> <p>'It is a glamorous lifestyle,' says Rob Barber, a contributing editor to Surf-girl . 'You travel between beaches being adventurous. Why shouldn't women be a part of it?' </p> <p>In the past couple of years the number of surf schools in the UK has more than doubled, a factor that has helped women in particular. </p> <p>'Women look on learning differently to men,' says Dave Reed, national director of the BSA. 'Men believe they can do it without instruction while women prefer to take lessons. In many surfing schools, 40 or 50 per cent are women now.' </p> <p>Bentley runs a surf academy for girls and says she has five-year-olds who can get to their feet. When she started, 13 years ago, it was rare to see another female face. </p> <p>She is sponsored by Roxy, the female-only label created by surfing brand Quiksilver that recently began the Roxy Surf Now Tour 2004, which teaches girls to surf through the summer. Other brands are doing similar things. More than a thousand girls took part in the Davidoff Rip Curl Girls Go Surfing days held nationwide this summer, and another brand, Billabong, has started female-only surfing camps. </p> <p>Surf-girl also takes novice and intermediate female surfers out for one-week holidays to Lanzarote. </p> <p>Divya Patel went on a trip in January. The 32-year-old's first surf attempt in New Zealand ended in concussion but she was determined to try again. 'Lanzarote was my way of catching up with my husband and it was fantastic,' she says. 'We plan all our holidays around surfing now.' </p> <p>The pair are hooked. 'We had to go to a wedding in Lake Como [in Italy] recently. I just looked at the big lake and thought without the surf it was just a waste of water.' </p> <p>The magazine has also teamed up with surfing gear manufacturer O'Neill to run surfing weekends for women, including two in September with additional yoga classes. Most surfers also do yoga as part of their fitness regime. </p> <p>Surfing can be an all over work out, using the shoulders and arms to propel yourself up on to your feet, stomach and leg muscles in balancing and nearly everything else to do the tricks. </p> <p>'I run, swim, box and do yoga to train for surfing,' says Whiteley. 'But nothing is as good for fitness as the surfing itself.' </p> <p>At the end of my lesson I felt totally wiped out. I could see that apr\u00e8s -surf existed as I walked back through Newquay but had little energy to join in. </p> <p>There were groups of men and women sitting by the coast and passing around spliffs - during a recent student competition one local said the town had been 'full of the smell of weed'. </p> <p>For those on short holidays there are masses of cheesy clubs and a prominent beer-drinking culture. But for the hardcore surfers, Newquay is simply about catching waves and the evenings are about chilling out. </p> <p>With just one lesson I caught the surfing bug and am already hoping to go on another weekend. The street-cred for girls who surf is massive and I really want to rip. </p> <p><b>A body fit to hit the surf</b></p> <p><b> Calories </b> Surfers burn roughly the same number of calories as long-distance runners do, about 230 calories per hour. </p> <p><b> Stamina</b> is needed for surfing and paddling out. Those who try surfing must be able to swim 50 metres. Surfing is good for the lungs and heart. </p> <p><b> Strength </b> The upper torso muscles, arms, shoulders and abdomen are used for paddling and pushing up, the legs for standing up, and the stomach and legs for balancing. </p> <p><b> Flexibility </b> Technical moves require flexibility which helps in bringing the board under control. Many do yoga in order to increase focus.</p>",
  "Donald 'Carolina' Biermann arrived at Angola prison in 1980. It was America's most violent jail, a Deep South sinkhole for killers and rapists. 'I came to Angola with the sole intent of dying here. I just did not care,' said the burly 48-year-old South Carolinian serving a life sentence for murder. <p>But things have changed in this sprawling Louisiana jail that inspired Hollywood films such as Monster's Ball and Dead Man Walking. Biermann, once a feared inmate, is now in his second year at a seminary that has opened inside the prison. </p> <p>He hosts a Bible class for fellow prisoners on his wing each Thursday. 'Jesus took the hate out of my heart,' he said with the glazed conviction of a true believer. Around his thick necks hangs a shiny crucifix made of prison-issue screws. </p> <p>Biermann is not alone. Angola, America's largest maximum security prison, has undergone a transformation: it has found God. Controversial warden Burl Cain has opened the prison doors to religious groups like no other jail in America. The result has been a stunning decrease in violence. In 1995, Angola saw 799 incidents of inmates attacking each other and 192 attacks on guards. This year the figures so far are just 78 inmate-on-inmate assaults and 19 on staff. </p> <p>Angola is dominated by religion. Pastors and preachers flock for visits. Its seminary is the only one of its kind in the US. Hundreds of prisoners are taking its four-year course; scores have graduated as ministers. Religious radio pumps through the prison 24 hours a day. </p> <p>Next month, a similar seminary, modelled on Angola, will open in a jail in neighbouring Mississippi. Florida and Alabama are also studying the idea. What has happened in Angola could spread all over the South. </p> <p>But for some Cain has gone too far. He has been criticised by the American Civil Liberties Union for blurring the cherished line between church and state. 'Endorsing religion like this is going over the line,' a spokesman said. For some, the prospect of Christian fundamentalists in control of a prison is a source of worry and fear. A Louisiana state senator, Don Cravins, recently complained that Cain's rule at Angola was too authoritarian. 'There is no accountability,' he said. </p> <p>Angola does seem a world unto itself. Its 18,000 acres (larger than Manhattan) are surrounded on three sides by the Mississippi river. Its fourth side hides behind densely wooded hills. It was once a slave breeding plantation, named after the part of Africa where its miserable captives were born. In 1901 it was taken over as a state prison and is now home to 5,108 inmates. </p> <p>It is still a place of unique horror. In Louisiana a life sentence means you will die in prison. In Angola more than four out of five inmates have life sentences. They know that they will leave the jail's embrace only in their coffins. Unsurprisingly, Angola has always been famed for brutality, riots, escape and murder. That was something Biermann knew all about. For years, the jail's violence was his way of life. </p> <p>'I have done things that people would say are inhuman,' he said bluntly. 'A lot of the people I have done them to are still in here.' </p> <p>All that changed with Cain. As violence levels have fallen, so chapels have sprouted in Angola's prison camps. A freshly painted white spire stands over Camp C. Another chapel is half-built at Camp F. A gift of $200,000 will kick-start work on a new, much enlarged, chapel for the main camp. All are built with inmate labour. Sitting at the same wooden table at which he attends a weekly Bible class with his wardens, Cain is unashamed of his religious beliefs. He cuts a very Southern figure, with a rich accent and speech littered with homely sayings. But he is blunt about what is happening at Angola: 'God is working through this prison.' </p> <p>Cain knows his jail intimately. As he speaks he constantly takes phone calls: one to arrange a free eye operation for an inmate, another to discuss the firing of a warden recently arrested for having sex with a 13-year-old. He holds the hands of Death Row prisoners as they die in Angola's execution room. Cain's face is the last thing they see. And it was in that spartan chamber that Cain first realised he had to change Angola. </p> <p>'When I came here I had been a warden for 13 years. I had just done it like I always had done it. Then I saw the first execution,' he said. 'We didn't say anything to the guy about his soul. I just thought \"What we are going to do to make this place better?\"' Cain decided that religion was the answer. </p> <p>In his nine years in charge of Angola, Cain has also decided that many inmates need a second chance. Life should not always mean life. </p> <p>'We are wasting human beings. Prison should be a place for predators, not for dying old men. Some old men are predators and they can stay but we need to tell the difference,' he said. Cain says he knows many inmates who he believes should be let out, but is adamant he is no liberal: 'We are not soft.' </p> <p>No one who spends any time inside Angola can think it is a soft regime. It still looks like a slave plantation. Like 19th-century photographs come to life, work teams of mostly black prisoners march daily into the fields to toil under the Louisiana sun. It is backbreaking labour among cotton and corn. Watching them are mounted guards cradling rifles. Prisoners are paid just four cents an hour. In the punishment block, J-Block, inmates can spend 23 hours a day in their cells. Several have spent more than 30 years in solitary confinement. </p> <p>Given the hopelessness of most prisoners, perhaps it is not surprising that the seminary has been such a success. The college sits incongruously in the main prison camp marked by the sign 'Baptist Theological Seminary'. Inside, Chaplain Robert Toney sat in a room lined with Bibles and one book entitled Making Peace With Your Past. Inmates go to class from 8am to 3pm daily. 'They get the same qualification as students on the outside, take the same exams and study the same books,' he said. </p> <p>It is a tough course for some prisoners, many practically illiterate. But it gives their lives purpose. William Fallon, 26, a handsome man with a neat haircut, is serving life for murder. Now a born-again Christian, he is in no doubt where he would be without the seminary. 'I would probably be dead. If not dead, then insane,' he said. Fallon showed off his T-shirt. On his chest was a verse from the Bible: 'Then the Lord answered Job from the whirlwind.' He spun around to proudly show off the T-shirt's back. 'See me coming through Angola like a whirlwind,' it read. </p> <p>Angola's seminary is now producing convict missionaries. Ron Hicks, 34, also serving life for murder, hopes to be one of them. He is a graduate of the seminary and would like to preach in other jails. 'It all depends on where God calls me,' he said. 'You can walk through my wing now and see the games room with people praying. You see Bible studies going on.' So far 13 graduates, trained to spread their religion, have left Angola to serve their sentences in other jails. They have set up their own ministries in their new prisons. Perhaps, finally, there is a way past Angola's razor wire and walls.</p>",
  "On 25 June, a small 12ft boat slipped up the Shannon estuary and within the hour attracted the attention of two helicopters, two assault craft and a police riverboat. <p>The occupants - two men and a woman - were not engaged in drug or people smuggling, or even in a spot of illegal fishing. 'We held up our sign so that the river police could read it clearly,' said former Irish army officer Ed Horgan. </p> <p>What it said was 'Bush Go Home', and given that the President of the United States was at that moment flying in to land at Shannon airport it was perhaps inevitable that the three should be escorted under armed guard to Ennis Court House, where they were charged with breaching public order. </p> <p>Horgan is something of a thorn in the flesh of the Irish government. After 22 years in the army, where he served as Commandant (Major) in charge of the First Tank Squadron, and having served with the UN in the Middle East and Cyprus, he has most recently been actively engaged in opposing the present government's stance on Iraq. </p> <p>In April 2003 he brought his case to the high court in Dublin, challenging the government's decision to allow Shannon airport to be used for the movement of US troops and munitions and for the refuelling of US aircraft going to war. </p> <p>He claims this was in contravention of international law and, in particular, incompatible with Ireland's historic role as a neutral country. Although not enshrined in the constitution, neutrality has long been government policy, first declared by De Valera in 1939 prior to the Second World War and reaffirmed many times over. </p> <p>However, since the invasion of Iraq, Horgan maintains, this neutrality, cherished by many, is being eroded and continues to be. </p> <p>About 150,000 US troops have passed through Shannon airport, transported in US military aircraft as well as in chartered civilian planes. </p> <p>The high court dismissed his case, although he was awarded 50 per cent costs as the judge felt he had raised an issue of national importance. </p> <p>Since then, he has engaged in more individual action, including returning his cherished service medals and, most recently, using a small boat in a manner which the Irish authorities clearly felt was a threat to President Bush. The charge brought against him was that he was breaching public order by being in a public place within an exclusion zone. </p> <p>'How you can have one within a public place I don't know,' he says, 'and where it was exactly in the water I don't think they knew either.' </p> <p>Horgan draws his strength from the fact that he sees what is happening in the world from his perspective as a military man, as an international peacekeeper and from an academic point of view: he is currently writing his doctorate on reform of the UN. He is passionate about the issue of war and the role of the individual in aiding and abetting it, directly or indirectly. 'We provided everything the US troops needed at Shannon, down to the sandwiches,' he said. 'By doing so, we have participated, to date, in the killing of 13,250 Iraqi civilians. Because of this we are now potential targets since, under international law, Iraqis have the right to defend themselves.' </p> <p>To some, the idea of Ireland's neutrality is a pleasing but unrealistic pipe dream. They believe that, instead, Ireland must cease its posturing and play a military role both within Nato and the EU. </p> <p>Horgan disagrees. Though not a pacifist - he describes himself as a peace activist - he believes Ireland can never be anything more than the tail end of a major army. He thinks the country can make a huge contribution to global peacekeeping, but its credibility with the global community is now being eroded.</p>",
  "The noise of the two Black Hawk helicopters shattered the eerie silence that yesterday had enveloped the city of Najaf. On board were a team of five Iraqi ministers led by Minister of State Kasim Daoud. They landed and were driven in a convoy, led by police cars with sirens wailing, through streets littered with the wreckage of battle, to the sacred Imam Ali shrine to inspect the damage. <p>The trip came two days after Iraq's top Shia leader, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, brokered a peace deal to end fighting between the Mahdi Army of rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and US and Iraqi forces which left hundreds dead. </p> <p>'We have come to consolidate the peace settlement we reached and to congratulate Sistani,' said Daoud. </p> <p>The siege of Najaf is over. By yesterday the surviving fighters of the Mahdi Army had left the shrine and dispersed, their weapons thrown on wooden handcarts, or some hidden to fight another day. American troops guarded parts of the perimeter of the city, but the newly formed Iraqi security forces have now taken control. One of their first discoveries was 20 decomposing corpses stored in a Mahdi office, which they claimed were executed captives. The Mahdi Army said they were its own casualties and dead civilians, but at least one had what appeared to be a noose around its neck, and police discovered a dungeon under the building. Scared civilians speak of a 'reign of terror'. </p> <p>Whatever happens now, the new Iraqi government, installed in power just under two months ago by the US-led coalition, has weathered its most critical test to date. In Washington and London there is great relief - as there is in Najaf itself. </p> <p>Whole areas of the city are now in ruins; scores of civilians are dead and tens of thousands of people have left - or lost - their homes. The hotels and restaurants that serve the pilgrim trade to the ancient town are smashed hulks, the roads are littered with ordnance, much of the world-famous cemetery has been shot to pieces. </p> <p>It seems a world away from the scene a few days ago. On Thursday the helicopters overhead were Apache gunships, readying missiles, while on the street below a tank poured a long burst of heavy machine-gun fire into a building, stopped firing, reversed a few feet with its tracks grinding across the rubble-strewn street, and then fired again, filling the air with concrete dust, the acrid smell of cordite and a blast of teeth-jarring noise. Less than a hundred yards away a wall beside a shop disintegrated as the stream of bullets smashed through it. There was a series of loud cracks - each followed by a gut-wrenching thump - as old Soviet-designed rocket-propelled grenades missed the tank and impacted on buildings around. The fighters resisted with sharp rattles of Kalashnikovs, answered by the steady, chugging thump-kathump-kathump of the cannon mounted on the three armoured personnel carriers in the next street. Above, the Apaches twisted away. The howl of a jet built up before abruptly cutting out. Another deafening blast, then a pause during which the sound of another fight half a mile away could be heard, and then the Kalashnikovs rattled again. </p> <p>For most of the last three weeks Najaf has been the site of the most intensive battles in Iraq since the war began. Though fighting only a thousand or so lightly armed men from the al-Mahdi militia - a ragtag of young Shia zealots led by firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr - the US army faced a block-to-block battle of ferocious urban warfare. The violence reached its greatest intensity in the middle of last week, with the US military using almost every weapon in its arsenal - except artillery and their biggest air-dropped ordnance - to break the will of the dwindling bands of fighters. Some slipped away, but many kept fighting. </p> <p>Everyone in Iraq knew the battle was coming. Al-Sadr, 30, the son of a nationally revered cleric killed by Saddam Hussein, had been rapidly recruiting militia. His fiery anti-American and anti-Semitic sermons appealed to unemployed youth, particularly in the poorer areas of Baghdad and the major Shia-dominated cities of central and southern Iraq, who see the US-led coalition, and the government it relinquished formal political control to in June, as illegitimate. In April an attempt to destroy Sadr failed in the face of fierce resistance. A showdown was inevitable. </p> <p>At the beginning of the month it came - in the religious city of Najaf. Sadr had picked his battleground astutely. The Americans, who provide the new Iraqi government's only reliable security force, would not be able to attack the shrine of Imam Ali in the centre of the city, the holiest site in the world for Shia Muslims, for fear of provoking all Iraqis. Sadr also had his eye on the lucrative Najaf pilgrim trade. With a secure base and a cellar bunker, Sadr and his men prepared for a long fight. </p> <p>The first two weeks saw US soldiers battling tomb to tomb through the huge cemetery on the outskirts of the city. US officials claimed to have killed hundreds of Mahdi Army fighters; the true figure was far lower. 'I fought for two weeks in there and I never saw an enemy,' one First Cavalry soldier told The Observer . But the militia took casualties, and by the beginning of last week were forced back into the narrow alleyways in the 'old city' around the gold-domed shrine - which the fighters used as a base and ammunition store. </p> <p>I spent six hours on Wednesday working my way on foot through the fighting and into the old city. The streets were deserted, full of debris, ammunition, unexploded ordnance, dead dogs, rubbish, blackened stock from burnt out stores, smouldering cars, barbed wire and empty US army ration packs. Electricity lines lay strewn across the shattered road surfaces, water spurted from smashed pipes. Those few civilians who had stayed in their homes - tens of thousands had left - kept inside, sheltering from war and the 45-degree midday heat. Salah Alawi Jassm, 58, said the people of Najaf had two enemies: 'the Americans and the Mahdi'. Outside his door bullets hissed along the street. </p> <p>The US forces used three main weapons: armoured vehicles in the streets, demolishing suspected al-Mahdi positions; Apache helicopter gunships with jets in support; and snipers. Despite thermal imaging, the problem was locating a target. 'Do you know where the enemy is at?' asked one First Cavalry trooper, smoking beside his Bradley fighting vehicle. </p> <p>The snipers established themselves around the edge of the old city. Their aim was to shut down the flow of food and ammunition into the shrine and to limit the Mahdi fighters' movement in the town. They did it with devastating ruthlessness. At about noon on Wednesday I saw an old man with a donkey cart moving slowly up one of the larger roads towards the old city. A bullet brought down the animal. An hour later I passed the same spot and the man was dead too, a few feet from the animal, blood soaking his white robe. </p> <p>Snipers also targeted fighters trying to reach the sanctuary of the shrine. A low barricade, constructed from twisted metal wreckage, provided scant cover for the dash from the surrounding alleys to the sacred courtyard. Every movement provoked a furious fusillade of high-velocity rounds. Some fighters made it unscathed. Some didn't. One wounded fighter, blood streaming from a stomach wound, was pushed on a handcart across the bullet-scarred tarmac, his face astonished at his own pain. The snipers let him reach the makeshift medical clinic staffed by volunteers inside the shrine. </p> <p>Despite the continual barrage, the fighters were defiant. Messages were broadcast from the shrine's loudspeakers: 'O Mujahideen,' one said. 'God is great. Long live the Mahdi Army. Fight, fight, fight.' A false rumour went round that two US tanks had been destroyed. 'We will fight them to the last drop of our blood,' said Khalid Hada, 23, who had been a soldier in Saddam's army until it was demobilised by coalition authorities. 'There has been no withdrawal,' lied Walid Shaha, 34, a bodyguard of Sadr. As we spoke, jets roared in twice to drop bombs and two huge blasts shook the ground - one showering us with debris. Each explosion was followed by firing of such intensity that individual reports became indistinguishable in the welter of noise. The men handed round biscuits. </p> <p>The guns in Najaf fell silent on Thursday at 3pm - the moment Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most senior Shia cleric, entered the city following a triumphal procession from the southern port city of Basra. Sistani, who spent the last three weeks in London convalescing from heart surgery, called on Sadr, who was reportedly wounded early in the fighting and had been lying low, to evacuate the shrine and allow the pilgrims in. The injunction from the senior cleric provided a welcome way out for the young rabble-rouser and, on Thursday night, Sistani's spokesman was able to announce that 'inshallah' there would be peace. </p> <p>Many questions remain. Will success in Najaf give way to long-term failure for the new Iraqi government? How much more trouble can Sadr and his Mahdi Army cause elsewhere? </p> <p>An indication came on Friday. While being interviewed by The Observer, a Mahdi fighter spotted a group of officers from the new Iraqi police force approaching in contravention of the peace deal. Muttering 'traitors', he slid the bolt on his weapon while his friend clipped a belt into a heavier automatic. Within moments, a full-scale fire-fight broke out. Four more men, including three civilians, were being carried away, leaving trails of fresh blood in Najaf's streets.</p>",
  "<p>At immigration control in Los Angeles airport a couple of weeks ago, I submitted to the bureaucratic ordeal that now routinely greets British visitors to America. When I finally convinced the customs officer that I was not seeking employment, asylum or the destruction of the free world, she asked me who it was I had come to interview. Tim Robbins, I replied. 'But,' she said, a look of bemusement lending sudden animation to her expressionless face, 'he hasn't got a movie coming out.' I told her that I was there to talk to him about a play he had written. 'Right,' she nodded, then supplied a little cautionary advice: 'Just don't be taken in by his politics.'</p> <p>Only in America is it no surprise to find a state official who is aware of a film actor's latest output, and only in America would that actor's political pronouncements inspire that official to issue a warning, almost as a condition of entry. It's hard to overstate the prominence of movie stars in US culture. It's often been said that they are the nearest equivalent to royalty and, as with the royal family here, they can be forgiven almost anything but an opinion.</p> <p>On the whole, Americans will accept their politicians behaving like actors - thus Ronald Reagan became president and Arnold Schwarzenegger has morphed from Terminator to governor of California without a noticeable diminution in respect for his abilities - but they don't much like their actors coming on like politicians. And Robbins, a vociferous opponent of the war in Iraq, is seen by many of his fellow citizens as way too political. </p> <p>Dating back through 'Hanoi' Jane Fonda's exploits in the anti-Vietnam War movement to the McCarthy witch-hunt in the Fifties, there is something about so-called Hollywood liberals - the disjunction perhaps of pampered multimillionaires identifying with the oppressed peoples of the world - that brings froth to the mouths of many middle Americans, and in particular conservative media commentators. With the possible exception of Michael Moore, no one winds up radio talk-show hosts quite as reliably as Robbins.</p> <p>At the same time, for a certain kind of progressive cosmopolitan, Robbins is a hero, a man who speaks his mind regardless of the ensuing vilification. With his partner, the actress Susan Sarandon, he has often criticised the American government, both Democrat and Republican. A few years ago, he and Sarandon used their spot at an Oscars ceremony to bring attention to the plight of Haitian immigrants with HIV interned at Guantanamo Bay. The fuss that caused was more 'Here he goes again'. No one really questioned his patriotism.</p> <p>Last year, however, the couple was disinvited to the Baseball Hall of Fame's celebration to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the film Bull Durham, the baseball comedy in which Robbins met Sarandon. Robbins saw it as a concerted attempt to inhibit free speech. As if to prove that he won't be gagged by the threats to his social life, he has written a play called Embedded, a satire which mocks the compliant role of the American media in its coverage of the invasion of Iraq and takes broad aim at sinister forces within the Bush administration.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the play will be staged in London, having already drawn sell-out audiences in New York and Los Angeles. When I met up with Robbins at the Sony Pictures studio lot in Culver City, he was in the middle of editing a video of the play that is to be shown at the Venice Film Festival. </p> <p>At 6ft 4in, and 45 years of age, Robbins maintains an unlikely but inseparable relationship with the adjective 'boyish'. Though his hair is now more salt than pepper, and his fleshy protean features appear to have belatedly set, there's something elastic in the way he holds himself, not quite gangly but unmistakably youthful. It's in his smile, however, a shy heartwarming gesture that you can never see quite enough of, that his adolescence is most effectively preserved.</p> <p>Part of the reason that you want more of the smile is that Robbins, for all his comic ability, can be self-consciously serious. He makes it clear that he doesn't go in for Hollywood gossip. Indeed, he takes every opportunity to remind me that he doesn't go in for Hollywood. He and Sarandon and their three children live in the more bohemian environment of downtown New York. </p> <p>For all his size, he does not occupy space like a celebrity. There's no force field of fame. He's approachable, if not particularly accessible. He wears jeans and a T-shirt with the legend 'The Actors Gang', the theatre group he founded in the early Eighties. The son of Gil Robbins, a member of the Highwaymen folk group, Robbins developed his twin interests in theatre and politics at an early age. He went on anti-Vietnam War marches as a kid and, when a teenager, set up an improvisational troupe with his sisters called Theatre of the New City. One of their productions was a satire on Watergate.</p> <p>He studied drama at UCLA and moved swiftly into TV with parts in soaps like St Elsewhere. His progress in film was not so rapid. It was not until he was 30 that his gawky charm was properly captured in Bull Durham. But it was Robert Altman's Hollywood satire The Player, in which he played a slick, paranoid studio executive, that his lead potential was seen. He then went on to write and direct and star in a political mockumentary, Bob Roberts, in which he played a folk-singing right-wing political candidate, an achievement that led Altman to suggest that he could be 'the next Orson Welles'. Since then, he's directed the acclaimed Dead Men Walking and starred in an impressive range of films, from the Coen brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy to the slow-burn hit The Shawshank Redemption. Earlier this year he deservedly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his haunting performance as a grown-up victim of child abuse in Mystic River. </p> <p>He's still artistic director of the Actors Gang, and though he's been accused of autocratic management, it is from this LA-based theatre group that he recruited most of the US cast for Embedded.</p> <p>'Once a year,' he tells me, 'I do a training thing with all the new actors. In order to do the workshop you have to be an intern and help out in the theatre, and in return they get free training. I come in and do intensive 10-hour days for six days straight.' He looks tired, heavy lidded, and talks in a half-formed sentences punctuated by hippyisms. 'I don't think I've ever been so busy in my life,' he explains. 'It's really cool.' He runs me through his schedule for the next month, which includes acting, editing, visits to London (to prepare but not perform in Embedded) and Venice, and finally a brief tour supporting Pearl Jam with his weekend band Gob Roberts as part of an effort to register voters for the presidential election in November.</p> <p>'We started this band last summer and played some at the Sundance film festival in the winter,' he says and flashes one of his semi-embarrassed smiles. 'We do mostly Bob Roberts songs electrified and amplified. It's just pure unadulterated fun.'</p> <p>But before the fun, there's Embedded, which he says he was inspired to write following his experience in London filming Michael Winterbottom's Code 46 during the build-up to the war in Iraq. 'I was getting the impression that there was a debate, because I was reading London papers. I was getting balance. Even in the Times - isn't that owned by Murdoch - if they presented the WMD side, they presented the other side too: journalism, what we have come to mourn the loss of in America.'</p> <p>He says that the American media coverage was all about 'fear-mongering, propaganda, demonising', and compares its uniformity to Soviet news reporting. He then explains that while, in the wake of 9/11, he could not bring himself to protest against the war in Afghanistan, he did not agree with the strategy of 'indiscriminate bombing'. If he had been president, he 'would have trained special ops to go do the job right' and not interfered with Afghanistan sovereignty. 'The democratic movement in any country has got to happen on its own. It's never going to happen through bombs and airplanes. Never going to happen that way.'</p> <p>Various aspects of this speech strike me as naive or fantastic (not least the magical powers of special ops), but for the sake of historical accuracy I merely point out that there is a historical precedent for bombs and airplanes bringing democracy.</p> <p>'How? When?' He sits up, suddenly rattled.</p> <p>I mention Germany and Japan in the Second World War.</p> <p>'It seems to be that we always come back to that. I don't know it didn't happen without the determination of the people involved.'</p> <p>I point out that it didn't happen in East Germany, and he replies: 'I'd have to go into the history and the specifics of that. It came at the end of the gun but with the influx of a huge amount of money: the Marshall Plan. In Iraq, the money is going into war-mongering. It has nothing to do with democracy. It's about destabilisation. That's what Kosovo was about. It's the same thing any time there's a threat to US national security.' This is not the typical conversation one has with American film actors, and I feel a professional obligation to steer it back to more familiar territory such as marital infidelity and substance abuse (neither of which appear to loom large in the Robbins biography) but I recall something he had said in an interview some years back. 'The only responsibility I have to anyone is to make sure that when I talk about something, I know what I'm talking about, that I've done the research. I take that responsibility very seriously. I read a lot.'</p> <p>So I ask how Kosovo was a threat to US security.</p> <p>'Ahm...' he hesitates. 'I believe... I'm not the right person to talk about this... but that region of the world, this is the way I've heard it put... Can I go get a cigarette?' He disappears and, as if having remembered his Noam Chomsky, returns a minute later with a ready-fit anti-imperialist answer. 'Where it's all flawed is this hegemonic belief that if you bring business to a country it will help them.'</p> <p>Leaving aside what he had said a moment earlier about the Marshall Plan, I say that when I visited Kosovo it was less about bringing business than preventing communal bloodshed.</p> <p>'I'm ignorant on this subject,' he admits, without bluster. 'I'd have to read up on it.' He returns to Iraq, a subject on which he has done a fair amount of reading. Contradicting himself once again, he repeats the line that the Iraq war was a neoconservative plot hatched in 1989 by Bush advisers who believed 'they could spread democracy. They thought they were altruistic' - so not about destabilisation after all - 'They were wrong.'</p> <p>Robbins is not a politician and it is therefore a little unfair to parse his words, teasing out the contradictions and inconsistencies. But his muddled thinking, in which the only continuum is that American foreign policy is always bad, informs his writing as a dramatist. He shows me a scene that he's editing from Embedded that is both pretentious and simple-minded - not a happy combination - and is reminiscent of the worst shouty agitprop. </p> <p>With admirable foresight, he is not planning on good reviews in London. 'It would be nice to get embraced by a critical community, but we're not expecting it. It was word of mouth in New York. We're doing a populist theatre.'</p> <p>In the scene I see, a 'cabal' of neocons, including caricatures of Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz, sit around in commedia masks detailing their conspiracy to run the world. Robbins talks eloquently about the use of masks, something he picked up from the Theatre du Soleil. 'The tendency when expressing emotion is to be too frantic,' he says. 'So we're trying to get people to settle and trust their emotions. What's important is what comes through the eyes.'</p> <p>The problem is that it's hard to imagine a more frantic style of acting than that on display in Embedded. The actors deliver their lines with the exuberance of people taking part in a celebration of political solidarity rather than a satirical drama. I suggest to Robbins that such theatre has to contend with the charge of 'preaching to the converted', and indeed I can't imagine many visitors to the Riverside Studios looking to have their prejudices challenged.</p> <p>'That's one of the lines that's always in reviews,' he says a little wearily. 'And \"sophomoric\" and \"didactic\". It's a non-criticism. First of all, it's not true. My answer is: who's the choir? Who's the converted? An awful lot of liberals supported that war. Even if there was a choir it was way out of tune. They were not singing together. So even if it were true, it's OK.'</p> <p>Since Robbins first started protesting against the war, American politics, and its reporting in the media, has undergone the beginnings of a sea change. It's no longer seen as un-American to question aspects of the US-led occupation in Iraq. I wonder if Robbins had detected a more loquacious mood among fellow actors in Hollywood. 'I don't know,' he says a little tersely. 'I don't live here. I don't know this world. I don't go to the parties. I can't speak for them.'</p> <p>This sounds like a mechanical answer, designed to confirm his position as the celebrity anti-celebrity, the Hollywood player who refuses to play the game. I press him further. 'Look,' he says, 'you can count on one hand the actors in Hollywood who came out against the war. The biggest joke is when people say you do it for attention or your career.'</p> <p>Doubtless it's not pleasant reading unkind things about yourself in the newspapers or hearing snide jokes on TV, but you sense that Robbins savours his position as the film industry's most outspoken voice. </p> <p>'I remember thinking,' he goes on, 'when I went to that anti-war rally: OK, the shit's going to fly. But the shit's going to fly inwards if you don't do it. Because you were afraid of what? Being less rich? After the Hall of Fame thing, I was so thankful I lived in New York because you have to walk around. And people came up to me and said \"Thank you\". Two people said negative things - they were both white men and both in SUVs, and both shouted out the window and drove away. The second time I was able to get one word out and that was: \"Enlist.\" </p> <p>'Because my essential problem with that war, beyond the politics, is that we're getting the poor people to fight the war, and they were put there by people who got out of military service.'</p> <p>When he can resist the lure of cheap conspiracy theories - a test that he failed in what I saw of Embedded - Robbins can talk with impressive passion. Here you see the dramatist as orator. You either agree with him or not. However, it's when the activist shapes the actor that Robbins should beware. That's a matter of aesthetics, and there doesn't seem much debate that the beautifully subtle acting of Mystic River wins out every time over the student histrionics of Embedded.</p> <p>The best-read politico in Hollywood may, as compliments go, rank alongside the tallest pygmy, but there's much to be said for an actor who reads the world's press. And as long as his platform is not the stage, Robbins should not be ridiculed for expressing his views. Even if you don't agree with them.</p> <p>He tells me that at the Oscars a number of actors came up and whispered to him: '\"Thanks for speaking out.\" They whispered. Why?' He shakes his head and then smiles, a big sparkling dimpled grin that somehow says more about Robbins than any of his speeches could ever begin to articulate.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Embedded will be at Riverside Studios, Hammersmith, London W6 (020 8237 1111) from 31 August to 23 October</p>",
  "The cult of the hero is back, dusted off for a modern audience in Walter Salles's biopic, The Motorcycle Diaries . The film, recreating the South American journey that changed Che Guevara from a middle-class medical student on a gap year to a Marxist icon, has many things to tell an audience too young to have Blu-tacked his picture on a bedsit wall. <p>Adventurers will love the film's Peruvian landscapes and the attempts to drive an overloaded Norton 500 through an icebound mountain pass. Those who want their movie stars to be doe-eyed hunks will approve the casting of Gael Garcia Bernal, who is Mexico's answer to Jude Law, only prettier. </p> <p>Despite reverential reviews, there is also plenty for Che-haters to dislike. Salles never hints at his flaws or the rages he displayed during his rise to become the guerrilla leader who helped secure Castro's victory. Four decades after his death, Guevara sways between the charismatic inspirer of youthful protest and the man whom Daniel Wolf, writing in the Spectator, calls 'a savage ideologue, a mesmeric fool'. </p> <p>What Guevara had, and still does, is an authentic link to the myth of the hero. From Odysseus to Muhammad, those who command worship have set out on lonely quests to bring back enlightenment to their people. True, today's icons have cut some corners on the altruistic front. The visions of Christ tempted by Satan in the wilderness and that of Beckham beguiled by his PA in Madrid do not invite much comparison. </p> <p>Nor do contemporary world-changers resemble Che. Osama bin Laden was never likely to become the poster boy of British campuses and neither is the latest revolutionary to emerge from the shadows. Though not a natural successor to Guevara, Mark Thatcher's alleged aims were hardly less politically bold. The charge against him, which he denies, is that he was enmeshed in a failed attempt to overthrow the President of the oil-rich Equatorial Guinea. </p> <p>Such a coup could, in other circumstances, have been termed heroic. Pre-emptive strikes have the George Bush imprimatur, and Teodoro Obiang sounds a leader ripe for regime change. Obiang, whose cavalier take on political correctness might give even Michael Howard pause for thought, keeps all his country's oil money for himself and is rumoured to eat the testicles of executed prisoners to improve his sexual prowess. </p> <p>Regrettably, the object of the failed takeover moves it outside any Promethean realm. The purpose seems to have been to make what Thatcher's friend and alleged co-conspirator, Simon Mann, would call 'a large splodge of wonga'. Still, guilty or innocent, Sir Mark (as the BBC obsequiously calls him) represents a breed of hero that took over where Che left off. The Guevara industry was still thriving when Margaret Thatcher came to power and ordained, in money and status, other objects of reverence. </p> <p>Mark, vapid and arrogant, was the travesty of the Thatcherite demigod. Academically dense, he acquired an estimated \u00a360 million, a penchant for fast cars, and a blonde, Texan millionairess wife. Thatcher's lifestyle, founded in the days when JR Ewing was the face of corporate responsibility, remains preserved in a Kiplingesque time warp. His mock-Tudor mansion is run by 14 black servants and his speed dial seems full of ex-public-school yahoos who refer to one another as 'Scratcher' and 'Smelly'. </p> <p>If the Eighties plutocrat, of whom Thatcher is the enduring caricature, was a dismal successor to the Seventies idealist, then current icons are hardly more reassuring. The gloomy view says that hero worship has given way to idolatry of the trashy. Princess Diana, Posh and Becks and the rest of the Hello! canon are held up as the least inspiring objects of veneration since cave-dwellers began it all by honouring hunter-gatherers who slaughtered mammoths for lunch. </p> <p>In America, John Kerry would look less lustrous but for anti-Bush adverts featuring Scarlett Johannsson and Matt Damon. Hollywood has already ploughed \u00a328m into the Kerry campaign and P Diddy, rather than the candidate, is entrusted with finessing the hip hop generation's vote. Though the BBC's recent Great Britons series named Winston Churchill as this country's leading icon, his fondness for 'walking with destiny' has little obvious resonance. Weeping with Paula is more to the modern taste. </p> <p>Even so, the cult of celebrity is yesterday's trend. Kerry's reliance on stars would be seen as curious in a Britain sated with priapic footballers and spoilt actors. The new objects of reverence are Olympians, which strikes cynics as almost as dismal. In their view, the spirit of the Games, once a crucible of political protest embodied in the black power salutes of 1968, has expired in a blur of drugs and tears. That stance is too pessimistic. </p> <p>Icons have two uses. The first is to show followers how to unleash their own hero potential, and this year's Olympiad has done just that. Crawler-lane swimmers with dreams of being Michael Phelps are turning public pools into choppy replicas of the Channel in a twister, and gyms are full of fat men making horrible gargling noises while lifting sparrow weights. </p> <p>The Games have also thrown up two genuine heroes. Amir Khan, the 17-year-old Muslim boxer born in Bolton, has smashed the racist BNP in the teeth, quelled the voices of Islamophobes and made ordinary Britons proud to have such a graceful and articulate representative. Kelly Holmes, a black woman who vanquished injury and disappointment, is another symbol of a Britain vastly altered for the better since Chariots Of Fire evoked the ghosts of Empire, pubic-school supremacy and the days when posh white men came first. </p> <p>A backdrop of Paula's misery, and the nation's synchronised snivelling, would best be forgotten, but for one thing. The second purpose of heroes, and anti-heroes, is to demonstrate the art of failure. Mark Thatcher, the odd man out in modern iconography, was always good at this. So, in the end, was Che Guevara, whose mythic stature was encapsulated in his challenge to his murderer: 'Shoot, coward, you're only going to kill a man.' </p> <p>Time magazine's list of 100 heroes and icons, ranging from the Kennedys to Marilyn Monroe and Muhammad Ali, is a catalogue of imploded ideals, marriages and health. But bad outcomes have become officially taboo. The notion that Britons cannot abide success is simply untrue. The real spectre is disaster. From middle-class parents demanding the best for their children to politicians proclaiming dubious policies and misguided wars a success, society is obsessed by the cult of winning. No wonder our athletes dare not countenance imperfection. </p> <p>The stars of modern fairytales are groomed to deal with every nuance of adversity except meltdown. In the end, Paula Radcliffe did something more heroic than get a medal. Her exit, dry-eyed and dignified, from the 10,000 metres, showed she had absorbed the lesson grasped by every icon from Eric the Eel to Che Guevara. She had taught herself how to fail. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@observer.co.uk\">mary.riddell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "In the balmy sunshine of an August afternoon, the Grizedale estate in Everton, north Liverpool, comes across as a perfectly pleasant place to live. The neat rows of terraced two-storey houses are painted in pretty pastel colours, the small gardens are beautifully manicured, there is little graffiti and expensive cars sit in many of the driveways. <p>But appearances can be deceptive. The estate, which sits in one of the most deprived areas in Britain, is at the heart of a vicious gang war which has left at least three men dead and seen dozens of others wounded. At the last count more than 250 of Grizedale's residents - around one in eight of the estate's population - have been arrested for drugs, weapons or violence. Hundreds of weapons have been recovered from the estate including a powerful sniper rifle complete with telescopic sight and ammunition. Despite this the shootings and car bombings have continued, leading local politicians to criticise police tactics and declare the situation to be 'out of control'. With police resources stretched to cover two massive festivals in the city this bank holiday weekend, many residents of north Liverpool fear a new wave of violence over the trade in heroin and crack cocaine. </p> <p>The feud between drugs gangs based in Everton and their rivals in nearby Kirkdale had been simmering for years but hit the headlines last September when the home of former salesman Tony Richardson was sprayed with gunfire during a drive-by shooting. Richardson, whose fianc\u00e9e is actress Jennifer Ellison, recent winner of ITV's Hell's Kitchen reality programme, is something of a local legend. Wrongly accused of taking part in a gun attack on a prominent local family linked to the Kirkdale gang (he was arrested and held in custody for four months before the case was dropped), he has been inadvertently caught up in the violence and targeted by the drugs gangs ever since. There is said to be a \u00a350,000 contract on his head though there is no suggestion he is anything other than a victim of the feud. </p> <p>A few days after the attack on Richardson's home a massive car bomb blew up outside Club 051 in Liverpool's city centre, shattering windows in nearby hotels, shops and offices. Miraculously no one was hurt. There was another lucky escape six days later when a nailbomb was thrown into the middle of the packed Dickie Lewis pub in Kirkdale. The device, which skidded across the pub's dancefloor, had been lit but failed to detonate. Police have little doubt that if the bomb, filled with razor-sharp shards of metal, had exploded it would have cost lives. </p> <p>In January 19-year-old Danny McDonald, supposedly responsible for the Dickie Lewis attack, was shot dead in the Royal Oak pub. Four months later on 6 April Craig Barker, also 19, died on the edge of the Grizedale. He and three friends were driving out of the estate when a gunman sprayed their car with 18 bullets. Barker was hit repeatedly in the chest, the driver was hit several times in the legs and another passenger, Mark Richardson - younger brother of Tony - was struck in the back. The third passenger escaped without injury. </p> <p>Revenge was swift. On 11 April 19-year-old Michael Singleton was gunned down in Kirkdale after several men burst through the back door of his house and shot him in the head and chest. He bled to death on the kitchen floor. A month later father-of-three David Regan was gunned down in broad daylight on the forecourt of the car-wash he owned in the Old Swan area of Liverpool. Masked gunmen shot him in the back four times. His brother, Michael, was also injured in the attack and has been moved away from the area for his own safety. </p> <p>Police responded with a massive show of force, setting up a mobile police station in the centre of Grizedale to co-ordinate raids, removing graffiti and handing out personal attack alarms to residents. They quickly identified 18 key figures behind the dispute and set about arresting them and their associates. They include five brothers from the estate who cannot be named for legal reasons but are believed to be major figures in the local underworld. The eldest, just 26, is now awaiting trial for unlawful wounding after allegedly slashing a police officer with a knife during a drugs raid. Three of the brothers face separate trials for making threats to kill while the final member of the family is a co-defendant in an upcoming case of alleged kidnap and wounding. </p> <p>By the end of July it seemed that police had the situation under control and the mobile police station was taken away. But then came the shooting of 26-year-old Anthony Wright. He and his girlfriend were getting out of their car close to his Kirkdale home when a masked gunman ran towards him and fired four shots into his chest at point blank range. Wright, a semi-professional footballer with no criminal connections, is believed to have been targeted because his cousin is on an attempted murder charge. He remains in a serious condition. Then on 12 August a massive car bomb exploded outside the police station in Walton Lane, strewing wreckage more than 100 metres. </p> <p>Despite hundreds of arrests all three gangland murders and most of the shooting incidents remain unsolved and police are reluctant to confirm links between them for fear of jeopardising future legal proceedings. Questioned over recent events Chief Superintendent Mike Langdon, area commander for Liverpool North, told The Observer: 'Major investigations are ongoing in respect of the incidents that you have referred to. In respect of each matter a significant line of investigation is underway to identify any potential links to a small number of key criminal players.' </p> <p>But Peter Kilfoyle, MP for Liverpool Walton, believes the current tactics provide only a short-term solution. 'Nothing that has happened so far is going to cure the problem,' he said. 'The people who have been arrested will eventually return and the problems will start again. There are several areas in the north of Liverpool which used to be decent but are rapidly going down the pan. There is an ingrained culture which says the worst possible thing you can do is become a grass and that is not being addressed.' </p> <p>Since the clampdown, recorded crime on the Grizedale has actually started to rise. This, say police, is a sign that their campaign has been successful. In the past residents rarely reported crimes because they were too scared of reprisals; the fact the figures are rising is proof of growing confidence. </p> <p>But for many residents the improvement in the quality of life is not expected to last. 'The kids round here, they're only young but they don't believe there is anything for them except selling drugs,' said one mother-of-three speaking on condition of anonymity. 'And so long as there's a demand, there's always going to be someone who wants to make money by providing the supply.'</p>",
  "Whitehall is bracing itself for a wave of requests for the disclosure of highly sensitive documents as new Freedom of Information legislation comes into force in January, according to information commissioner Richard Thomas, whose job it will be to adjudicate in disputed cases. <p>Top of the list will be the controversial legal advice from the Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith, on British military intervention in Iraq. Requests for the disclosure of the full advice and changes that were made to it in the run-up to war will act as an early test of the new watchdog. </p> <p>It is thought that Goldsmith initially warned against intervention without a second United Nations resolution, but later changed his mind. </p> <p>Parliamentary Ombudsman Ann Abraham ruled in June that the government was right to keep the advice secret to protect the legal principle of client confidentiality. </p> <p>But in an interview with The Observer, Thomas said he expected to rule on the issue again as soon as the government's freedom of Information Act goes live in six month' time. </p> <p>The commissioner confirmed that the legal advice fell within his remit and would not be covered by the Official Secret Acts. 'We have to ask the simple question: does the public interest in disclosure outweigh the public interest in non-disclosure?' </p> <p>But he warned against the act becoming the monopoly of liberal campaigners and journalists hoping to trip up the government. </p> <p>'It is a huge mistake to see Freedom of Information as an issue just for the chattering classes trying to embarrass Whitehall,' he said. </p> <p>Thomas, a former Director of Public Policy at Clifford Chance solicitors, said he had been inspired by his work for the Citizens Advice Bureaux legal service to represent the disadvantaged. </p> <p>'I know how disenfranchised people feel. This must be about local issues: housing schools, planning. At the end of the day the acid test will be if ordinary people make these requests, not just investigative journalists.' </p> <p>The commissioner has already shown his readiness to take on the government on matters of principle. At the end of last month he publish his detailed concerns about Home Secretary David Blunkett's plans for identity cards. He said he was worried that there were not enough checks to stop the government changing the use to which the cards could be put over time - so-called 'function creep'. </p> <p>'We have got to be clearer about the lead purpose. Personal information should not be used for anything other than that which it was collected,' he said.</p>",
  "<p>The cocktail party is a strange invention. (So indeed is the cocktail, when you come to think about it.) But it does have one useful function, over and above those of filling the gap between work and dinner, and enabling people to pretend that they are communicating when in fact they are merely sizing one another up. </p> <p>The really useful thing about the cocktail party is that it helps us understand the absurdity of auctioning off slices of the electromagnetic spectrum to phone companies and broadcasters. </p> <p>Eh? Bear with me. Cast your mind back to the spring of 2000, when the government auctioned off radio frequencies allocated for 3G mobile telephony. The auction was cunningly designed by a game theorist from University College London to extract the maximum amount of cash from bidders, but even he must have been astonished by the outcome. </p> <p>What happened is that the mobile networks slid remorselessly into a bidding frenzy and wound up paying \u00a330 billion for their little bit of the spectrum.And that was on top of the cost of actually building 3G networks - which goes some distance towards explaining why, despite all the hoopla, we have seen precious little action on the 3G front so far. </p> <p>It also explains why, when the technology finally goes mainstream, 3G will be dominated by services involving pornography, gambling and sport - that is to say the only services capable of generating the revenues needed to reduce the networks' mountainous debts. </p> <p>So what has the humble cocktail party got to do with all this. Patience, dear reader, patience: I will get to that in a moment. But first we need to take a brief scientific digression. </p> <p>Mobile phones are basically little radio transmitters that send out bursts of electromagnetic radiation. In that sense, they use the technology invented by Marconi in 1897. For most of radio's first century, it was believed that the only way to have multiple, simultaneous transmissions was to broadcast each signal on a different frequency. Otherwise the broadcasts would interfere with one another - so a listener seeking the BBC Light Programme might find herself listening to bursts of crackly Dutch from Hilversum, and vice versa. This belief that it was essential to allocate separate segments of the spectrum to different transmissions was not just an article of faith in the broadcasting and regulation communities: it was regarded as a law of nature. </p> <p>And it had a very important implication: it meant that the spectrum was a finite (and valuable) resource that had to be owned and controlled by governments. In the early days, governments merely allocated slices of spectrum to particular applications and candidates. So some chunks went to maritime and aeronautical applications, another chunk went to AM radio, another to FM radio and television, another to Citizens' Band radio (remember that?) and so on. </p> <p>Later on, some bright spark had the idea that instead of giving away slices of spectrum, governments ought to auction some of it to the highest bidders - which is how Gordon Brown came to have a \u00a330bn windfall in 2000. </p> <p>This entire system was essentially built on a single foundation: the belief that radio transmissions could not share frequencies without giving rise to unacceptable levels of interference. The only problem is that this belief turned out to be an artefact of technology at a particular point in its development. </p> <p>It was true in Marconi's day - and for a long time afterwards - that radio signals needed to be separated from one another on the spectrum; otherwise receivers would be unable to distinguish between them. But all that changed sometime in the 1960s, when people began to explore new technologies for transmission and reception. It turned out that if you used clever ways of multiplexing (ie spreading transmissions over many frequencies) and made receivers that were driven by intelligent software rather than the dumb wireless sets of yesteryear, then you could pile lots of signals into the same spectrum space with little or no interference. </p> <p>Which is where the cocktail party comes in. The noise level at these events is often deafening. Yet individuals are clearly able to have one-to-one conversations because each can make out what the other is saying, despite the din. And the reason for this is obvious: we are intelligent beings, conditioned to be skilled at picking up fragments of speech and using context and body language to assemble them into coherent wholes. </p> <p>The new generation of software-based radios work in much the same way. They are able to pick out signals from what appears to be a cacophony of interference. In the process, they also threaten to undermine the old article of faith - that spectrum is a finite resource. In principle, with new technology, it's effectively infinite. How long, one wonders, will it take that particular penny to drop? Stay tuned - as we used to say in the old days.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a> . <a href=\"http://www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/\">www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/</a></p>"
