  "A major criminal network believed to have been involved in arranging more than 300 sham marriages in Britain has been smashed by the Immigration Service, it emerged yesterday. <p>Officers disrupted a number of weddings at a south-west London register office at the weekend, leading to several arrests. </p> <p>At least four people - including the alleged mastermind of the ring and a bride and groom - have been charged. </p> <p>The scam allegedly involved women from the Netherlands who claim to be working in Britain being flown in to marry west African men, exploiting a loophole in the law which allows foreign nationals to stay in the country if married to an EU citizen working here, without being required to show an intention to live together. </p> <p>It is understood the organisers charged up to \u00a310,000 to arrange the ceremonies, paying the \"brides\" between \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,000. The men and women were thought to be told enough about each other before the ceremony to convince officials that they were having a relationship. </p> <p>The investigation began after authorities noticed a pattern of women flying on single ticket journeys from the Netherlands. At first they were suspected of being drug mules; further investigation revealed the marriage scam. </p> <p>The alleged ringleader, who was arrested in east London, has been charged with two counts of conspiring to defraud the home secretary, two counts of perjury and one count of bigamy. </p> <p>The suspected groom has been charged with perjury and deception and the bride with perjury and attempting to assist a foreign national break British immigration law. </p> <p>Four more people - three men and a woman - were arrested on Sunday and Monday on suspicion of being involved in immigration offences. </p> <p>According to Mark Rimmer, the director of registrars in the north London borough of Brent, more than 10,000 bogus marriages take place for immigration purposes in Britain each year. He estimated that at least 8,000 were in London - one in five of all weddings in the city. </p> <p>\"But to be honest that is a conservative estimate,\" he said. \"I know of at least one borough where they thought every other marriage was a sham.\" </p> <p>New legislation is about to come into force which will require all foreign nationals to get permission from the Home Office before they can get married. </p> <p>Those from outside the European economic area will have to prove that they are in the country legally, and others entering on a \"fiance\" visa will have to convince officials that the intended marriage is genuine. </p> <p>\"What we do not want to happen before the legislation is enforced is an 'end of season sale' scenario, where we get a large number of scam weddings between now and then,\" Mr Rimmer said. </p> <p>The tell-tale signs of fraudulent marriage include body language and an inability to communicate other than through an interpreter. </p> <p>Couples frequently produce bogus utility bills, bank statements and similar documents, supposedly proving their residence in Britain. The same documents have been seen at different register offices, with the names changed. </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, said: \"These operations are testament to the enormous effort and hard work by the Immigration Service to protect the UK's immigration and marriage laws from abuse by determined criminals.\"</p>",
  "When President George Bush landed on the deck of the Abraham Lincoln last May in full battle regalia, under the banner Mission Accomplished, the election looked like a done deal and commentators moved on to the aesthetics. <p>This display of hypermasculinity in the midst of wartime, some concluded, would have a particular appeal for women voters. Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan said that she half expected Bush to \"tear open his shirt and reveal the big S on his chest\". One Wall Street Journal columnist pronounced him \"a hottie\". Rightwing talkshow host G Gordon Liddy proclaimed that the president \"has just won every woman's vote in the United States of America\". </p> <p>Paradoxically, it seems that the women he appealed to most are those who are already hitched. The women most likely to be on the lookout for a \"hottie\", namely single women, are increasingly devoted to his Democratic rival John Kerry. </p> <p>With six weeks to go before the presidential election, one of the best ways to find out how a woman is likely to vote is to check her ring finger. A recent poll shows Bush ahead of Kerry among married women by 13%, while Kerry has a 25% lead among unmarried women. Indeed, the difference in voting intentions between single and married women - 38% - is far greater than that between men and women, which stands at 5%. </p> <p>What has been described as the \"marriage gap\" could prove crucial, particularly for the Democrats. Women settle on their presidential choice later than men, and so comprise most of the small number of coveted undecided voters that remain. In a race this close, the party that can identify the women who are most likely to identify with the party could make the difference between victory and defeat - so much so that pundits have invented a new political construct just for the occasion. After \"angry white men\" (1994), \"soccer moms\" (1996), the post 9/11 \"security moms\" (2002), and the drag-racing-fanatic \"NASCAR dads\" (2003), there is now the \"Sex and the City voter\". The term may jar, but the phenomenon could provide a jolt. Single women represent at least 24% of the voting-age population and a massive 46% of voting-age women. </p> <p>But if the Democrats are going to win, say the pollsters, they are going to have to woo single women relentlessly. To that end, they launched a programme called Take Five last month, which encourages the faithful to convince five single women who don't usually vote to go to the polls. </p> <p>The marriage gap is not new. But each election year it has grown increasingly huge, more than doubling over the past 20 years. Views differ on why this should be. Some of it can be explained by other demographic factors that are related to, but not defined by, either marital status or gender. According to the census, more than half of unmarried women earn less than $30,000 (\u00a316,800) a year, while more than half of married women have annual household incomes of more than $50,000 (\u00a328,000). And the wealthier you are, the greater the likelihood that you will vote Republican. </p> <p>Personal factors also play a role. Married women often vote the way their husband does. \"I registered Republican when I got married,\" Ginny Savopoulos told USA Today. \"But after I was divorced I was thinking more about, what's out there for me as a single woman?\" After struggling to find work as a paralegal, she was laid off two years ago and remains disenchanted with the war in Iraq. Still registered as a Republican, she plans to vote Democrat. </p> <p>The experience of having children further deepens the divide. Married women with children are even more heavily Republican than those without, while childless single women are even more sympathetic to the Democrats than unmarried mothers. Of the 10 states with the highest birthrates, all but one voted for Bush in 2000. \"Conservative, religious-minded Americans are putting far more of their genes into the future than their liberal and secular counterparts,\" wrote Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, in a recent article for the Washington Post. \"If Metros don't start having more children, America's future is Retro.\" </p> <p>But policy issues related to the current political climate also play a role. Married women place a higher priority on the war on terror and are more likely to value Bush's leadership, while single women are more concerned with such issues as health insurance and policing. \"It's not that single women aren't worried about security,\" says Kellyanne Conway, president of WomenTrend, a woman-centred polling organisation. \"But they are more likely to be concerned with job security and whether it's safe to get home than the war on terror. </p> <p>\"They're not so interested in small government because to them, the government is a partner and a safety net. For those women without husbands, Uncle Sam and Big Brother are the greatest protectors.\" </p> <p>The Republicans have adapted their message accordingly. As supporters in Madison Square Garden waved signs declaring \"W is for Women\", Laura Bush's prime-time convention speech was aimed squarely at parents: \"I want to talk about the issue that I believe is most important for my own daughters, for all of our families, and for our future,\" she said. \"George's work to protect our country and defeat terror so that all children can grow up in a more peaceful world.\" </p> <p>But the Republican approach also repels many singles. \"Republicans have this programme of trickle-down dignity,\" says Bella DePaulo, who studies singles' behaviour at the University of California at Santa Barbara and is currently writing a book called Singled Out. \"They portray a woman's life as in a family with mum, dad and the kids and have shut the door on anyone who doesn't fit into that.\" </p> <p>Claudia Bernett, a single, 32-year-old digital designer in New York, plans to vote against Bush. \"I'm not a great fan of Kerry but the Democrats at least say their intentions are to generally take care of people, while the Republicans are so brutal. Abortion is crucially important, but there are other agendas that even exceed that one - we seem to be at a very dangerous moment in time.\" Such views should present an opportunity and a challenge to the Democrats. The main reason the gender gap opened up in the first place, in the 80s, was not because they were doing so well among women but because they were losing so much support among white men, just over a third of whom backed Al Gore at the last election. </p> <p>For while single women are currently much more likely to vote Democrat, they are much less likely to vote at all. In 2000, Gore won the single women's vote by 31%, while Bush had just a 1% lead over married women. The trouble is, that while 62% of married women voted, only 43% of singles did. </p> <p>\"If unmarried women in Florida had turned out in the same percentage as married women, Al Gore would have won the state easily,\" Democrat pollster Celinda Lake said earlier this year. Indeed, if they had turned out at just the statewide average, then Gore would have won by a relatively comfortable 63,000. </p> <p>So why didn't they? Because nobody asks, says DePaulo. \"Just listen to the rhetoric of the politicians,\" she says. \"It's so much family values - it's as though single people don't exist.\" </p> <p>But the Democrats have been slow to grasp the existence, let alone the potential, of this enormous untapped resource. During the Democratic convention Kerry did not emphasise issues such as the economy or health care, which would have appealed to undecided women voters, but instead tried to outmacho Bush with his war record. Since this backfired he has returned to the kind of domestic issues that could well galvanise single women into making up their minds - not between Kerry and Bush, but between Kerry and not bothering. Whether he succeeds or not will largely depend on whether he has anything more to offer them than the chance to put two more men in the White House. </p> <p>\"The trouble with going after single women, those fans of progressive change, is that one has to offer them something progressive,\" wrote Katha Pollitt, a columnist for the leftwing magazine the Nation. </p> <p>\"It will be interesting to see if the Democratic campaign to sign up these voters involves offering them things they want.\"</p>",

  "<p>In the halcyon days pre-January, Shell used to summon analysts and the media to its landmark tower overlooking the Thames. </p> <p>Those occasions were presided over by former chairmen Sir Philip Watts or Sir Mark Moody-Stuart with a certain hauteur. </p> <p>Now, the trouble-prone group prefers to keep oil-watchers out of its headquarters, and yesterday used the Plaisterers Hall near the Barbican for what it had billed as a major strategy briefing. </p> <p>Another break with the past is that current chairman Jeroen van der Veer is a democratic Dutchman who could not do smugness if he tried. </p> <p>One of his endearing traits is to ask his exploration director Malcolm Brinded, a more natural performer it must be said, to tell him if he gets things wrong: \"Malcolm, check me if I drop the ball,\" van der Veer said at one stage. </p> <p>Brinded would be better telling his boss to kick the ball forward, score exciting goals and show some personal panache. </p> <p>But van der Veer is expert at dullness, and can make the world of black gold sound as glamorous as green peas. </p> <p>Yesterday, he raised his personal game slightly but not enough to convince the outside world that he is the dynamo that can bring a bounceback for Shell. </p> <p>And there was certainly no glittery new idea that would have measured up to the shimmering chandeliers of the hall, just a promise that a grim slog would eventually put the oil group back on track. </p> <p>Van der Veer has a tough job to do salvaging Shell's reputation and he is surely not the perfect man to lead once the new corporate structure is put in place next summer. </p> <p>An outsider would be better suited for that post, especially as van der Veer's name comes up, along with other Shell directors, in class actions in the US. </p> <p>It must be hard to focus on the way forward with the cloud of the past hanging over you but yesterday the chairman dismissed any hint of anxiety: \"No, I'm not concerned about that at all. I can look in the mirror.\"</p>",
  "<p>How about this for an idea to keep early evening TV schedules interesting - an Anglo-Australian soap exchange? They could send us a streaked-blond surfer type to shake things up around Albert Square, and receive in return some fag-chewing pub landlady to plot merry havoc on the beach. </p> <p>This is the basic principle behind Sarah Woods' multi-dimensional comedy, which lays out two parallel soap storylines, then cross-fertilises them with fitfully hilarious but often incomprehensible results. </p> <p>Lorna runs a salty East End boozer with something strange in the cellar. One day she goes down to change a barrel and re-emerges on the deck of a cruiser owned by sun-washed Australian beach-bum Thorn. It's a new lease of life for both of them, a world away from scripted platitudes, stock responses and long, lingering glances into the middle distance. </p> <p>Yet even in their liberated state, Thorn and Lorna have difficulty overcoming their conditioned reflexes. \"You see an out-of-control truck and you leap in front of it,\" explains Thorn. \"It's all I know.\" </p> <p>Laurie Sansom's production adds an additional layer of irony by casting two very capable former soap stars in the central roles - Ben Hull and Hannah Waterman, veterans of Hollyoaks and EastEnders respectively. And it adds a further level of surrealism by featuring Russell Grant (he of the astrological forecasts and terrible sweaters) in drag as a jowl-wobbling, pinafored gossip. </p> <p>Yet Woods cannot resist thickening the ingenious plot until it is no longer fluid. She has trouble keeping her inconsistencies consistent. Why, for instance, does the local handyman end up in hospital after a wildly capricious sea storm when, as far as we know, he was never on the boat? It's at points like these when parody of bad soap opera comes perilously close to bad soap opera itself. Soap bubbles nicely, but it doesn't really wash. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Until October 9. Box office: 01723 370541.</p>",

  "<p><strong>What's the next step in the evolution of blogging?</strong></p> <p>It would be nice to think it will be an awareness that just being able to publish stuff doesn't mean what you have to say is true, relevant or interesting. If you're writing online because you want to share your thoughts then that's fine, but those such as Dan Gillmor, who claim blogging is going to change the way journalism operates, are overstating things.</p> <p><strong>Is Creative Commons making inroads with the blogging/net fraternity?</strong></p> <p>Creative Commons is about far more than blogging or the net - it's about providing a model for the future of copyright that can challenge attempts by corporations to lock down our cultural heritage and assert control over intellectual property. Music and books are being published under Creative Commons licences, and now that academics at Oxford are writing a version of the CC licence that works with UK copyright law, we may see more take-up here.</p> <p>I hope that as people become aware of how rights-holding corporations are taking away the freedom to be inspired by works that copyright law was originally designed to preserve, they will start to look for books, music, and even films published under a CC licence. Eventually, I hope legislators resist the illegitimate demands of people who would deny us the public domain.</p> <p><strong>Will the BBC's proposed Creative Archive force others to change the way they make content available?</strong></p> <p>I hope so. The BBC can act in the wider public interest, taking advantage of its state-backed independence to do things the free market is clearly unable to deliver. The market has given us digital rights management - locked-down music, regionalised DVDs and ebooks that won't let you cut and paste from an out-of-copyright Jane Austen novel. The BBC can give us freedom to tinker, reuse and create.</p> <p>I've never believed those who say the BBC's online activity distorts the market - or rather, I'm in favour of distorting the market in the interests of us all rather than just the naked commercial interests of private companies.</p> <p><strong>Which of the emerging technologies most fires your imagination?</strong></p> <p>It's not really an emerging technology, because it was over-hyped two years ago, but I think that web services have the potential to change the way we use the internet. The model is basically just the latest approach to building distributed computing applications, where the separate modules communicate over the net using XML. It gets us away from the world wide web as a collection of pages on servers. The web was a really bad idea, because 10 years ago it diverted attention from the problems of building effective distributed systems in favour of a publishing model.</p> <p><strong>Gadgets?</strong></p> <p>My favourite gadget is, sadly, illegal in the UK.

  "<p>Wi-Fi is wonderful, but the current standards do not go far enough or fast enough. The search for ways to send more data faster over longer distances has produced a confusing number of wireless networking technologies - WiMax, Wireless USB, Ultra Wideband as well as new versions of Wi-Fi. So what is coming when, and which will you actually use?</p> <p>WiMax will be here first. Intel announced at its recent developer conference that its WiMax chips, code-named Rosedale, are ready for hardware manufacturers. They will have WiMax hardware on sale in the second half of next year.</p> <p>Although WiMax will eventually show up in notebook PCs (perhaps by 2006) and even in PDAs and mobile phones (probably in 2008), it will initially be used for supplying wireless broadband to the home or office, or for connecting Wi-Fi hotspots to the network backbone.</p> <p>You can use WiMax where ADSL doesn't reach, and, unlike existing wireless broadband systems, it does not require line of sight between the two points.</p> <p>WiMax will also be cheaper to buy and install. Scott Robinson, general manager of Intel's Broadband Wireless Group, predicts that WiMax devices will soon cost less than $200 - around \u00a3150 by the time they reach the UK. Within two years they could be as cheap as Wi-Fi is now.</p> <p>Although first generation WiMax devices may need an antenna on the outside of the building, it will also be possible to build access points that receive the signal through the outside wall, so you could install them yourself. BT is trialling a fixed wireless broadband service based on WiMax in Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and Northern Ireland. There's also the possibility of using WiMax on frequencies that do not need a licence, so community groups could install their own wireless broadband services.</p> <p>WiMax speeds will be comparable to ADSL. Although WiMax base stations deliver around 75Mbps, that will be shared among all the customers using that base station. One base station can cover up to a mile, and it can connect to a broadcast tower up to 30 miles away.</p> <p>WiMax will connect users to the internet, but you'll still need Wi-Fi to connect devices inside the building. This will encourage the sale of combined WiMax/Wi-Fi access points, which could include a standard phone line and a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phone connection.</p> <p>The second generation of WiMax will be more like Wi-Fi hotspots, so you'll be able to log on from different locations around town, or use it for networks in homes and businesses.</p> <p>True mobility means developing WiMax chips that can fit inside a mobile, and services that let you move from one base station to another without losing your connection. Third generation (3G) mobile phone systems already do that, but Intel thinks mobile operators might decide to use WiMax for data and save their 3G bandwidth for voice calls.</p> <p>Richardson thinks WiMax will eventually move to the frequencies currently used for broadcasting television. \"Nirvana for wireless is sub-1GHz, when the signal can go deep into buildings,\" he says. The UK government is talking about turning off analogue TV broadcasts by 2012, but there's no guarantee that that spectrum will be free for anyone who wants to use it.</p> <p>One way to avoid the problems of finding unused frequencies in an increasingly crowded radio spectrum is to use all of them. Ultra Wideband (UWB) - a technology developed for the US military - spreads out over a huge range of frequencies at a very low signal strength. To anything except another UWB system, it looks like background noise and gets filtered out. At least, that's what the companies working on UWB equipment say.</p> <p>Regulators are more worried about interference, and the US authorities are limiting it to the frequencies from 3.1GHz to 10.6GHz. This gives UWB a bandwidth of 100Mbps and a range of 10-20 metres, although hardware manufacturers want to go up to 30 metres.</p> <p>A bigger obstacle to the success of UWB is the fact that there are two rival groups developing different UWB systems. The UWB Forum, backed by Motorola, is building wireless connections into home entertainment systems, which could be ready by the end of this year.</p> <p>The Multi-Band OFDM Alliance, promoted by Intel, HP, Philips, Samsung and other companies, expects to have products next year, including a wireless version of USB. Wireless USB offers the same zippy 480Mbps as Hi-Speed USB 2, and is designed for replacing the cables between computers and peripherals.</p> <p>The IEEE group that is supposed to pick one of the systems as a standard is deadlocked. Rather than having an official standard, it looks as though we will see both systems on sale, some of them branded as WiMedia, plus Wireless USB. If the confusion puts people off, the winner could be yet another new wireless technology - the next version of Wi-Fi.</p> <p>802.11n uses essentially the same technology as existing Wi-Fi standards but with multiple antennae to send and receive data. It is faster, has better control systems to use less power, and better error correction to extend the range up to 90 metres.</p> <p>Bandwidth figures for wireless can be misleading because the actual throughput is always less than the theoretical data rate. However, it looks as though 802.11n will provide a 160Mbps connection. This is three times faster than the nominal 54Mbps that 802.11a and 802.11g offer, and at least six times as fast as the actual connections you get with 802.11g. It will be fast enough to use for streaming video around the home or office, and for making VoIP phone calls.</p> <p>One proposal for 802.11n could go as fast as 540Mbps by using more antennae and 40MHz channels instead of the standard 20MHz channels. That's legal in the US, but Europe only allows 30MHz channels and Japan is looking at 10MHz channels, so you could get different results in different countries. If you want to use 802.11n on a network with 802.11b/g devices, you will be restricted to 20MHz channels, but compatibility with existing kit is a big selling point.</p> <p>Those are almost exactly the speeds that UWB promises, but Wi-Fi has the advantage of familiarity, compatibility and a longer range. UWB has its own strengths: it needs less power than Wi-Fi because it uses sophisticated signals rather than brute force, it's less likely to suffer from interference, and it's easier to secure. That should make it easier to set up multiple UWB networks side by side, so you could make VoIP phone calls without stopping your camcorder downloading footage to your PC via Wireless USB while your set-top box is streaming a movie to the TV in the bedroom. UWB also makes it easy to get an accurate location for transmitters, so you can find out exactly where you are, or where your equipment is. It could even be used for guiding vehicles automatically.</p> <p>The IEEE is looking at three proposals for the 802.11n standard, and another 26 ideas, which could be improvements to the main proposals or developed to rival them. As usual, there are two main camps with different approaches, and it could take a while to get everyone happy, but the plan is to have a first draft by the end of 2006 and a final specification in 2007. Again, the manufacturers aren't waiting for the standard: we will probably see 802.11n products on sale next year, with the promise that you will be able to upgrade to the standard when that comes along.</p> <p>Whichever system wins, wireless connections will be getting faster, if more confusing. But don't expect things to happen overnight.

There was little to go on, but elements found in the boy's intestines linked the murder to a Nigerian cult that practised black magic.

  "Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of the organisation responsible for the beheadings in Iraq, is regularly portrayed by the US government as a terrorist mastermind, responsible for activity in places as widespread as Hamburg, Chechnya, Madrid and Mombasa. <p>But while there is no doubt that Zarqawi has committed awful crimes, experts say that accusing him has become an easy fall-back for the authorities as they struggle to contain the insurgency. There is no unanimity on whether Zarqawi is a henchman of Osama bin Laden or a rival. </p> <p>\"There is a lot of speculative stuff which, as far as one can tell, is based on rumour,\" said Paul Wilkinson, director of the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence at St Andrews University. \"On the face of it, it does not look likely that, however fanatical and assiduous, a terrorist would be active in so many theatres.\" </p> <p>There is no need to exaggerate his activities. The attacks he has claimed in Iraq are enough to justify the $25m (\u00a314m) the US has offered for his capture, the same as Bin Laden and al-Qaida's main strategist, Ayman al-Zawahiri. </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian in June, Lieutenant General Thomas Metz, the deputy US commander in Iraq, offered a more realistic appraisal of Zarqawi than the one emanating from Washington. He said Zarqawi's group was small but focused on \"catastrophic kinds of events\", huge car bombings or important political assassinations. </p> <p>Zarqawi's basic education and the writings attributed to him suggest he is not a strategist comparable to Zawahiri, the Egyptian urban terrorist who masterminds al-Qaida campaigns. </p> <p>Zarqawi is more a ruthless operational commander, putting strategy into action: a thug rather than a thinker. </p> <p>His aim, like Bin Laden's, is to recreate a pan-Islamist caliphate across the Middle East and beyond, headed by himself or a like-minded individual committed to a return to what he regards as a purer form of Islam. </p> <p>Gen Metz said: \"I think he wants to remain independent of Bin Laden and al-Qaida but he is doing their business because his goals, I believe, are closely linked.\" </p> <p>Zarqawi, 37, was born in Zarqa, an industrial town north of Amman, into relative poverty. Though the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, described him last year as a Palestinian, he is Bedouin. </p> <p>His name at birth was Ahmad Fadil Nazal al-Khalayleh and he took his nom de guerre from his home town when he became a full-time terrorist in 2000. </p> <p>The transformation began when he went to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan, though the war was almost over by the time he arrived. He returned to Zarqa in 1992 and was arrested a year later by the Jordanian authorities after guns and explosives were found in his home. </p> <p>Jeffrey Gettleman, a New York Times reporter, recently interviewed some of those who had been in prison with him and a picture emerged of a man who went into prison with little authority but gradually established control over his inmates. </p> <p>In prison he worked out obsessively, building up his chest and arms to acquire a more physical presence. One inmate said he was intolerant of anyone who read anything other than the Qu'ran. </p> <p>Released in 1998, he returned to Afghanistan two years later, setting up a training camp, and was possibly in contact with Bin Laden. </p> <p>When the US attacked in 2001, it claimed to have hit him in an air strike and that he had to have a leg amputated. That assessment had to be revised when he turned up on a video in Iraq with both legs intact. </p> <p>Some intelligence analysts have him fleeing from Afghanistan to various destinations, but the most credible location was a small pocket held by al-Qaida sympathisers in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. </p> <p>He returned illegally to Jordan in September 2002 and a month later a US diplomat, Laurence Foley, was assassinated in the capital, Amman. </p> <p>The next stop was Iraq. He was based, and may still be, in Falluja, which has put up the stiffest resistance to the US. The London-based daily, al-Hayat, carried an interview with an Arab who had recently claimed to have met Zarqawi in Falluja. </p> <p>The source rejected as US propaganda a strategy document purportedly written by Zarqawi in which he urged fomenting division in Iraq by attacking not only the US and Iraqi authorities but Shia Muslims. He saw the Shia as an \"infidel ideology\" but denied wanting to kill them. </p> <p>He said Zarqawi had no such compunction when it came to hostages, and that he claimed the killing of hostages was permitted by sharia [Islamic law] because they were not hostages but spies.</p> <p><b>Atrocities: facts and myths</b></p> <p><b> Attacks for which Zarqawi is probably responsible </b><br> <b>\u00b7</b> <b> October 2002</b> Laurence Foley, a US diplomat, assassinated in Amman<br> <b>\u00b7</b> <b> August 2003</b> Accused by US of being behind the bombing of UN headquarters in Baghdad and a Shia mosque in Najaf<br> <b>\u00b7</b> <b> May 11 2004</b> Zarqawi makes website claim of personal responsibility for beheading Nick Berg, US businessman<br> <b>\u00b7</b> <b> May 17</b> Bomb kills head of interim governing council<br><b>\u00b7</b> <b> September 20</b> Beheading of US hostage and day later of a colleague<br> <b> Activities for which he is blamed but probably not responsible</b><br> <b>\u00b7</b> Established a chemical training facility in the Pankski Valley, Chechnya, according to the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies<br> <b>\u00b7</b> Running a European network through a group in Hamburg<br> <b>\u00b7</b> <b> November 2002</b> Attack on Mombasa hotel and attempt to shoot down Israeli jet, according to Washington-based Weekly Standard<br> <b>\u00b7</b> <b> November 2003</b> The same report said he was linked to attack on a synagogue in Turkey<br> <b>\u00b7</b> <b> March 2004</b> Madrid train bombing</p>",

  "Russia will this week push for a UN resolution calling for the easier extradition of people associated with terrorists, in an attempt to speed the transfer of the Chechen separatist Akhmed Zakayev from London to Moscow, according to a Foreign Office official involved in the case. <p>Mr Zakayev, spokesman for the Chechen separatist leader, Aslan Maskhadov, was granted political asylum in Britain last November. His anti-Russian statements and promotion of the separatist cause have irritated Moscow.</p> <p>Despite a bungled extradition attempt, Moscow has exerted considerable diplomatic and rhetorical pressure on London, and has labelled Mr Zakayev a terrorist. </p> <p>It claims Mr Maskhadov ordered the seizure of the school in Beslan on September 1 and has put a $10m (\u00a35.6m) price on his head. Mr Maskhadov's former military deputy, Shamil Basayev, has since claimed responsibility for the crisis in which at least 329 people died. </p> <p>The FO official said: \"As we understand it, they want a new resolution with a whole range of counter-terrorist measures across the spectrum. One of them will be making it easier to extradite people like Zakayev who have alleged links to terrorism.\" </p> <p>He said Russia would also push for terrorism to be given a legal definition by the UN, seeking to capitalise on a week of international cooperation over terrorism. </p> <p>The move comes as the Russian parliament called on the US and UK to restrict the activities of Chechen separatists living in exile in Washington and London. </p> <p>It will today debate a new bill \"on the fight against terrorism\", which includes proposals for greater restrictions on movement around Russia, the death penalty for terrorist activities and a ban on media coverage of terrorism. </p> <p>The British charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Moscow was hauled in front of the foreign ministry last week over Mr Zakayev's asylum, on which the home secretary, David Blunkett, has the final say. </p> <p>However, the FO official said Moscow had yet to present any new evidence that he was linked to terrorism. \"They are clearly unhappy that he can criticise Russia loudly in the media. I think it is more about political control than any hope that they will get useful information from him,\" he said. </p> <p>Russia's security service, the FSB, has said it believes Mr Zakayev is being allowed to stay in London because he is useful to British intelligence. An FSB official said last week: \"Why do [the British government and special services] need him and consider him important? He doesn't represent anything himself, and there's no one behind him. Maybe he's helpful if they want to criticise Russia. I can't see another motive.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tesco demonstrated its position as the country's biggest supermarket chain yesterday with a 24% rise in interim profits and its fastest sales growth in almost 10 years. </p> <p>The City now believes the group is on course to make \u00a32bn in profits for the whole of this financial year. </p> <p>Analysts at Citigroup pointed out that while Tesco had taken 75 years to break the \u00a31bn full-year profit barrier (in 2000/2001) it would probably surpass \u00a32bn soon. </p> <p>In the first half Tesco's pre-tax profits - excluding some exceptional items and including overseas operations -reached \u00a3822m. Its sales in Britain amounted to \u00a313.5bn, which is the equivalent of more than 12% of the spending on the country's high streets. </p> <p>The absolute rise in sales was 11.5%, but the figure more closely watched by the City is the like-for-like rise which excludes new store openings and reached 8.3%. </p> <p>Andrew Higginson, Tesco's finance director, said this was the biggest rise since the chain introduced its Clubcard loyalty scheme in 1995, but admitted such a level of growth would be difficult to maintain. </p> <p>Mr Higginson added: \"When we have a successful period like this we try to be paranoid ... Ours is an intensely competitive market. We don't know anybody on the boards of our competitors. We don't meet up. We've got to believe that they are out to get us.\" </p> <p>Tesco's shares were the fastest risers in the FTSE 100, gaining 9.75p to a record 285p. </p> <p>Tesco's growth in sales and profits in the 24 weeks to August 14 has taken place at a time when Morrisons issued its first profit warning in 37 years because of problems with integrating Safeway. Sainsbury's has also given a warning that its profits are going to fall to levels last seen in 1989. </p> <p>Even so Tesco is acutely aware of the changing fortunes of supermakets. Ten years ago Tesco and Asda, which has since been bought by the US's Wal-Mart, were the worst performers. Now they are the number one and number two respectively. </p> <p>Sir Terry Leahy, who became chief executive seven years and has steered Tesco's growth, said: \"This is a great British success story, but it's not finished.\" </p> <p>As well as seeking to expand in Britain - it recently bought 10 stores from Morrisons and is converting Cullen and Europa stores to its Express convenience store format -Tesco is expanding overseas. </p> <p>It has operations in central Europe, the Republic of Ireland and Asia where combined sales rose 14% and profits rose 42% to \u00a3140m. </p> <p>In Britain, Tesco refused to break down the 8.3% growth in like-for-like six month sales between its traditional grocery products and its non-food items such as clothing, DVDs and stationery. Petrol, though, had a big impact, because Tesco did not pass on price rises at its pumps. An 8.8% rise in like-for-like sales in the second quarter was reduced to a 7% rise if petrol is stripped out. </p> <p>In the first half it estimated its share of the non-food market was 6.5%, up from 6%, and said the rise in sales of its clothing labels Cherokee and Flo rence &amp; Fred was 39%, faster than any of its rivals. </p> <p>The group cautioned the Bank of England's monetary policy committee against any further rises in the official interest rate of 4.75%. Rate rises have been aimed at cooling the housing market. Sir Terry said there \"was no inflation to control in our business\". He added that Tesco had cut prices by \u00a35m a week. </p> <p>Tesco aims to cut its costs by \u00a3270m this year, largely through efficiency improvements, including the way it stacks its shelves, but Mr Hig ginson maintained the group, which is the biggest customer of British farmers, was not doing this at the expense of its suppliers. </p> <p>Tesco raised its interim dividend by 10% to 2.29p.</p>",
  "<p>I am, like, so loving Britney Spears right now. I never could get to grips with that whole schoolgirl jailbait thing - partly because I'm the wrong age, gender and of a boringly pedestrian sexual persuasion that does not require me to be monitored by tabloid vigilante campaigns, and partly because it sadly failed to reflect memories of my own formative years at an all-girls' secondary school in Catford. Where were the spiral perms and batwing sweaters? Where were the blackheads so liberally scattered by a vengeful God that it looked as if we had faces full of buckshot? Where were the friendships made and broken over the willingness or otherwise to trade Body Shop lotions? Where was the smell of desperation and Lulu? </p> <p>And the whole Baptist/virgin thing was problematic. Our RE lessons comprised a dizzying succession of attempts by the teacher not to offend any of the plethora of faiths - Christian, Muslim, Sikh, Jewish, Hindu - arrayed before her, little knowing that the only deity we worshipped was the one who could deliver us from sebum. Our (one and only) sex education lesson was a television lecture on the virtues of fidelity and condoms by the then (and let us pray they are still!) happily married Mike Smith and Sarah Greene. Unfortunately, by the time we were deemed old enough to see it, the back row contained a 12-weeks pregnant Michaela Taylor (\"rhyming slag\" as someone once called her, which I thought was almost worth the split lip she subsequently received) and any given lunch hour saw a dozen girls finishing their sandwiches with a Capri Sun and morning-after pill chaser. </p> <p>Now, of course, with two marriages to her name and numerous other rumoured liaisons, Britters has made the most impressive volte-face since my own dear mother, with a solid Catholic upbringing behind her, decided to specialise in family planning and now spends her days thwarting God's plans for the female population of south-east London. </p> <p>What Britney is doing, of course, is cleverly repositioning herself in the market. Having outgrown her initial fans, who are also now too weighted down with Sats and anti-depressants to find the time or energy to devote to such fripperies as pop music and celebrity gossip, she must seek out new ones. That keen business sense (presumably inherited from her mother, Lynne, who made her new son-in-law sign a pre-nup to protect her daughter's estimated \u00a310m assets) tells her that late 20-/early 30-somethings are the next socio-economic stratum with disposable income to fling her way, so she reincarnates herself as the kind of icon we welcome with open arms. The weight gain, the penchant for crappy clothes, the subliminal message that the delights of nubile youth can't hold a candle to the enduring charms of hamburger and H\u00e4agen-Dazs and the beginnings of what we trust will be a long line of calamitous mistakes with men - if that's not the result of a well-researched marketing strategy, I don't know what is. </p> <p>Even Spears Snr is doing her part. Which woman after the age of 25 does not recognise that look of tight-lipped despair on her mother's face as she is presented with the latest in a long line of undesirables who have unaccountably piqued her daughter's interest? Every photo I see of Lynne these days gives me a surge of nostalgia - for Alan, who used to write me letters on the intricacies of intercontinental ambulance design (how I wish I were joking), for John, a functioning alcoholic father-of-four (\"the shaking amuses the kids!\") and David, of whom the less said, the better. </p> <p>They were all products of my unerring ability to attract the strange, the lost and the irretrievably insane, and whose various oddities and incompetencies were all met by mum with the same frozen mask of fear and fury currently worn by Mrs Spears. And the wedding itself had something for everybody, didn't it? Romantics can focus on the lack of trappings as proof that lurve alters not where it velour tracksuits finds, spendthrifts can congratulate her for setting new standards of stinginess (\"\u00a310m in the bank and no open bar? And I was going to stump up for sugared almonds! Forget it!\"), feminists can laud the succinct deconstruction of the traditional matrimonial model inherent in the \"Maids\" and \"Pimps\" slogans worn by Spears and Federline's friends respectively, and those of us emotionally and financially drained by the increasing number of wedding invites descending upon us can at least hope that the goodie bag idea will take off.</p>",

  "The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, yesterday delivered a stern rebuke to nations that \"shamelessly disregard\" international law, explicitly chastising the United States, Sudan, Russia, Uganda, Israel and the Palestinians. <p>Mr Annan, who last week branded the US-led war in Iraq \"illegal\", told the UN general assembly that international law remained the cornerstone of global stability in a speech laced with many veiled - and at least one explicit - criticism of the US. </p> <p>He said, just minutes before US president George Bush spoke, that the law \"including security council resolutions ... offers the best foundation for resolving prolonged conflicts - in the Middle East, in Iraq, and around the world. Those who seek to bestow legitimacy must themselves embody it, and those who invoke international law must themselves submit to it.\" </p> <p>On the opening day of a two-week session attended by 64 presidents, 25 prime ministers and 86 foreign ministers, Mr Annan listed \"only a few flagrant and topical examples\" of human rights violations and indifference to international and national laws. </p> <p>He denounced terrorism in Iraq, violence in the Darfur province of Sudan, killings by both Palestinian suicide bombers and the Israeli state, the recent fatal hostage crisis in Beslan, Russia, and the actions of the Lord's Resistance Army in northern Uganda. </p> <p>He also mentioned the human rights abuses in Iraq committed in Abu Ghraib prison by American soldiers. \"In Iraq we see civilians massacred in cold blood, while relief workers, journalists and other noncombatants are taken hostage and put to death in the most barbarous fashion,\" he said. \"We have seen Iraqi prisoners disgracefully abused.\" </p> <p>Mr Annan argued that there was a knock-on effect when law was flouted. \"No cause, no grievance, however legitimate in itself, can begin to justify such acts,\" he said. \"They put all of us to shame. Their prevalence reflects our collective failure to uphold the law and to instil respect for it in our fel low men and women. We all have a duty to do whatever we can to restore that respect.\" </p> <p>To do that, Annan said, \"we must start from the principle that no one is above the law, and no one should be denied its protection. </p> <p>\"Every nation that proclaims the rule of law at home must respect it abroad. And every nation that insists on it abroad must enforce it at home. </p> <p>\"Today the rule of law is at risk around the world. Again and again we see laws shamelessly disregarded.\" </p> <p>He said some nations had used the war against terrorism as an excuse \"to encroach unnecessarily on civil liberties\".</p>",
  "Although he covered 13 separate wars, just one frame made photojournalist Eddie Adams, who has died of a neurological illness at 71, famous: at the height of the Vietnam war, he captured the exact moment a South Vietnamese police chief killed a Vietcong prisoner in cold blood, shooting him in the head. <p>The picture of General Nguyen Ngoc Loan firing his pistol at the prisoner standing only an arm's length away on a Saigon street was taken on February 2 1968, the second day of the communist Tet offensive. It was seen around the world as a shocking example of the brutality involved in an increasingly criticised war, and gave Loan the reputation of a ruthless killer, which dogged him for the rest of his life. </p> <p>Adams, who was working for the Associated Press agency, had hitched a lift with a television crew when they heard gunfire in Saigon's embattled Chinese quarter. But they saw no action, and were leaving when Adams noticed a policeman walking out of a building with a prisoner whose hands were tied behind him. </p> <p>\"All of a sudden, out of nowhere,\" Adams recalled, \"comes General Loan, who was the national police chief. I thought he was going to threaten the prisoner [with the gun]. So as quick as he brought up his pistol, I took a picture. But it turned out that he shot him.\" </p> <p>Adams believed Loan's explanation that he knew the Vietcong prisoner was the same man who had earlier murdered a friend of his, a South Vietnamese colonel, his wife and six children. After the war, Loan ran a pizza parlour in suburban Washington, where, before he died in 1998, Adams visited him. He reported that Loan said: \"You were doing your job and I was doing mine.\" </p> <p>Although Adams later commented that in the same circumstances he would take the photograph again because it was indeed his job, he did not exhibit it or show it in his Manhattan studio. He was reluctant to discuss the picture, despite winning a Pulitzer prize for it in 1969, though did once remark, referring to the image, that \"Photographs, you know, they're half-truths.\" </p> <p>The pictures that Adams was most proud of were a series he shot of 48 Vietnamese refugees who managed to sail to Thailand in a 30ft boat, only to be towed back to the open seas by Thai marines. The photographs, and their accompanying reports, helped to persuade the US President Jimmy Carter to allow nearly 200,000 boat people into America. </p> <p>Of the series, Adams said: \"I would have rather won the Pulitzer for something like that. It did some good and nobody got hurt.\" </p> <p>As well as his war work, Adams was known for his portraits, often in black and white, of such world leaders as Pope John Paul II, Anwar Sadat, Fidel Castro, Mikhail Gorbachev, Indira Gandhi, Deng Xiaoping, and US presidents Richard Nixon and George Bush. </p> <p>Adams was born and raised in New Kensington, a small town in Pennsylvania, and joined the photography staff of his high-school newspaper. Then he enlisted in the US marines, and served for three years as a combat photographer during the Korean war. From 1958 to 1962, he worked for the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, before joining the Associated Press. Between 1972 and 1976, he was with Time magazine, but then returned to AP as a special correspondent, leaving in 1980. </p> <p>He spent his remaining years freelancing for Life magazine and Parade, seen in millions of American homes as a Sunday news- paper supplement. He also joined several of the Day In The Life book series, including A Day In The Life Of The US Armed Forces, published in 2003. In 1988, he started the Eddie Adams Workshop to train aspirant photographers at four-day sessions. He worked until shortly before his death, despite being deprived of speech by the motor-neurone disease that was diagnosed last May. </p> <p>He is survived by Alyssa, his wife of 15 years, their 14-year-old son and three children from a previous marriage. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Edward Thomas Adams, photojournalist, born June 12 1933; died September 12 2004</p>",
  "Egypt is pressing ahead with \"very progressive\" ideas for reform, but changing the way the president is elected is not one of them, at least for the time being, a spokesman for the government party said yesterday. <p>Hosni Mubarak's fourth six-year term ends in October next year and opposition groups are pressing for a free election and a choice of candidates. </p> <p>Under the current system, parliament puts forward one candidate for approval in a yes-or-no referendum. </p> <p>As the National Democratic party's annual conference opened in Cairo with the slogan \"New thinking\", its policy spokesman, Mohamed Kamal, said constitutional changes would not be discussed. </p> <p>\"It is not on the agenda of this conference, but there are no red lines, no taboos whatsoever covering any issues related to political reform, including the issue of amending the constitution,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It's an issue of priorities ... we have other issues that we consider are of priority to the party ...

It might be a priority for other institutions.\" </p> <p>President Mubarak, who is 76 and has had two recent health scares, was absent from the opening session, but the growing influence of his 41-year-old son Gamal was apparent. </p> <p>The party officials who are to give media briefings are all reformers associated with Gamal, and opposition groups complain that he is being groomed to succeed his father. </p> <p>Although the NDP has not yet formulated a position on constitutional reform, it is planning \"major structural changes\" in laws relating to politics, Mr Kamal told a news conference yesterday. </p> <p>\"We are presenting very progressive ideas concerning amending the basic laws that govern political participation in Egypt,\" he said. </p> <p>These include the electoral law and the law on political parties. </p> <p>\"It's in the interests of the NDP, the majority party, to have a strong opposition,\" he continued. </p> <p>\"We believe in checks and balances, and we believe that when you have a strong opposition it will activate you, it will energise you.\" </p> <p>Mr Kamal said moves towards reform in Egypt had been inspired by the parliamentary elections four years ago when the NDP, which has governed the country for decades, failed to win an overall majority. </p> <p>\"The year 2000 was a setback for the party, and that's what really motivated the reform movement,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It has nothing to do with external pressure,\" he added, alluding to opposition claims that one of the main purposes of the reform plans is to please the US.</p>",
  "<p>The battle over the future of British Energy reached new levels of bitterness last night when the nuclear generator applied for an injunction against rebel shareholders in a US court. The power company wants a judge in the southern district of New York to rule that Polygon cannot force through its demands for an extraordinary general meeting and vote on an alternative rescue plan. </p> <p>BE accused Polygon - a London and New York-based hedge fund - of engaging in a \"manipulative and misleading\" scheme to acquire BE shares without making appropriate disclosures to the securities and exchange commission. </p> <p>Court papers from BE allege Polygon is engaged in a strategy of \"disinformation\", but the British firm itself is balanced on a knife edge. BE needs to have the legal case heard - and won - by Friday to avoid having to send out notices to officially requisition the EGM. </p> <p>If that meeting takes place and more than 75% of shareholders vote for Polygon's proposals, BE claims it would be forced into insolvency. </p> <p>The legal documents lodged by BE allege that Polygon filed a Schedule 13D disclosure to the SEC about its holding in the power group six weeks after it should have done. </p> <p>This was, says BE, a \"flagrant and deliberate violation of the federal securities laws\" aimed at giving it victory in \"its self-interested objectives\" at the shareholder meeting it has demanded. </p> <p>The company, which generates more than a fifth of Britain's electricity, also argues that Polygon informed authorities it had purchased shares in July \"for investment\" when really it wanted to \"control or influence\" BE. </p> <p>Polygon crossed a critical 5% reporting threshold on July 23 but did not file a Schedule 13D until September 13, BE claims in its legal submission. </p> <p>The nuclear generator argues that changing any terms of the original rescue package would be in breach of a binding creditor restructuring agreement and trigger the immediate repayment of \u00a31.5bn loans. </p> <p>This would also open it up to damages and \"there is a very real possibility that British Energy would be forced to commence insolvency proceedings\". </p> <p>Polygon reacted with fury last night to the legal challenge saying BE was trying to scupper its rightful demands for a meeting. </p> <p>\"Polygon believes its 13D filing was accurate in all material respects, and intends to fight this application which it sees as an attempt to undermine its statutory rights under English law to requisition an EGM,\" it said. </p> <p>The pending legal battle is the latest in a series of court threats made in recent days. Bondholders - who have tied up an existing rescue plan with BE - have issued a high court writ in London against Polygon. </p> <p>They warn the hedge fund that it will be pursued for damages if it proceeds with - and wins - any EGM vote to overturn the original rescue plan. They have also warned other BE shareholders that they too will be chased for damages if they support the Polygon proposals. </p> <p>Polygon is pushing for change in the terms of a \u00a31.3bn debt-for-equity swap which it believes over-compensates bondholders. </p> <p>Under the existing deal shareholders would get 2.5% of the new equity in BE and a further 5% through warrants. Polygon - which has enjoyed the support of another sizeable shareholder, Brandes Investment Partners - has put forward alternative proposals under which shareholders would seize back 30% of BE, on the basis that rising wholesale electricity prices have helped BE return to profit, from which shareholders should benefit. BE turned a \u00a34.3bn loss into a \u00a3232m pre-tax profit in the year to March 31. </p> <p>BE has always warned that it would delist the company from the New York and London stock exchanges and push through its own rescue plan if it lost any shareholder vote. </p> <p>Such a move would be highly controversial given that the government is closing this possibility in existing legislation with effect from 2005. </p> <p>The European commission has not yet ruled on whether state aid from the government, keen to see the rescue plan go through, is legal and this must be obtained for the restructuring to be realised. A positive decision is expected by BE and its bondholders, with some believing it could come today.</p> <p><strong>Hedge fund lies low</strong></p> <p>Polygon enjoys high-profile shareholder battles but, like other hedge funds, keeps a low profile when it comes to other aspects of its business. </p> <p>A sparse website contains no telephone numbers while the directory inquiries service insists Polygon is not listed at its address off the Kings Road in Chelsea. </p> <p>Even the public relations firm that does work for Polygon on the British Energy battle says it is not hired to talk about any other issue. </p> <p>Polygon itself is unwilling to talk or comment directly on British Energy, or on speculation that it has a 3% share in furniture retailer DFS. </p> <p>Last year it used another financial PR firm to help it lead shareholder opposition to plans by chairman Peter Simon to increase his family's holding at fashion retailer Monsoon. It was later reported that Mr Simon had called for a Financial Services Authority inquiry after it was found that Polygon held only one share in Monsoon. </p> <p>The hedge fund's website claims Polygon Investment Partners is a \"global investment fund\" with $1.35bn under management. It manages a \"single multi-strategy investment fund\" called Polygon Global Opportunities Master Fund, which BE claims has a principal office in the Cayman Islands. </p> <p>It is led by Reade Griffith, a Harvard College-trained economics graduate who was previously founder and chief executive of the European office of Citadel Investment Group. He has been working with Paddy Dear who had previously been managing director and global head of hedge fund coverage for UBS Warburg. </p> <p>This year Polygon bought bonds and shares in BE but quickly sold its bonds to concentrate on its equity. </p> <p>In yesterday's lawsuit, the hedge fund has been accused of working in co-operation with another shareholder, Brandes, and of not disclosing this to the US securities and exchange commission.</p>",
  "<p>We would have liked to have sent you all... Out of nearly 500 qualifying entries we could only pick a handful for the shortlist. Thanks again for all the wonderful ideas, funny stories and the time you took over your entries. To show how difficult it's been to decide on the best, here are a few edited favourites.</p> <p>Look out for the shortlist and your chance to vote <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/netjetters\">here</a> on Saturday.</p> <p><strong>Jenny, 22</strong><br> \"You're going to get lots of worthy people applying to be Netjetters. People with worthwhile and serious causes: delousing orang-utans in Borneo, freeing Tibet. People who desire only to broaden their horizons, who want to experience the wonders of nature. Essentially, people who deserve a writing spot in your fine newspaper.</p> <p>\"Well, not me. My plan entails something altogether more lowbrow. Yes, my Netjetter dream is to go on the trail of my favourite movies, to forsake the splendour of the natural and ancient worlds for the squalor of the urban landscapes I know (from a lifetime in the fourth row from the back) and love.\"</p> <p> <strong>Jonathan, 31</strong><br> \"For the past seven years I have had a constant companion on my holidays. Purchased in a misguided attempt at self-improvement, The History of the World by JM Roberts condenses into 1,200 or so pages everything of note that has happened on Earth since the Big Bang. It's a tough read.</p> <p>\"So, if I'm honest, a part of my dream holiday would involve finishing the book and then ceremonially disposing of it, killing the monkey on my back once and for all. And where better for a resting place for the book than the Ganges, the holiest waste disposal system in the world?\"</p> <p><strong>William, 28</strong><br> \"Flexibility is our itinerary. It is essential to be able to say to your companion over breakfast, 'I quite fancy the southern Japanese island of Shikoku today, lover' and then be there in time to dine on fugu, a highly venomous puffer fish. Our quest will be guided by such impulses. </p> <p>\"Dominique, with whom I fell madly in love in Santiago, will be once more pooling her resources with mine in Barcelona in November. There we shall gorge ourselves on all of the Catalan capital's juicy fruits ... We will then plot a leisurely anti clockwise course, scaling the Pyrenees, sipping the wines of La Rioja, retracing the steps of the ancient pilgrims' trail to Santiago de Compostela, hitchhiking along the Portuguese coast, and finally swooping down on the Moorish tip of southern Spain. From here a vault over Gibraltar into Morocco, our springboard into north Africa from which we plan to execute a pin drop dive deep into the heart of the continent before resurfacing in the Red Sea. Once our scuba gear is rusty, we will shuffle on towards Australia ...\"</p> <p><strong>Mo, 32</strong><br> \"At school I'm daydreaming again. I'm browsing through a battered atlas and exotic names appear before me - Timbuktu, Chittagong, Addis Ababa, Samarkand, Sapporo, Sheffield. Well Sheffield could sound exotic to a Bedouin in the Sahara desert!</p> <p>\"My job involves guiding delinquents who have been excluded from their classes. My errant pupils idea of travel is to \"TWOC\" (taking without owners consent) a car and joyride to Barnsley with the police in hot pursuit. I desperately need an extended break to maintain my sanity.</p> <p>\"I envisage an itinerary that would take me off the beaten track. A journey where beards and booze (hopefully) prevail. I am fascinated by facial hair and I'm on a quest in search of the perfect beard.\"</p> <p><strong>Gareth, 28</strong><br> \"It's tragic really, I'm 28 and have never been in love. On the bright side, however, there are roughly 2.8billion females in the world. If we guess 15% of them are in my age range, which gives 420 million. Being cautious about this, let's say I'm compatible with 0.5% of them, that means there are 2.1 million women with whom I could fall in love. Having once made the mistake of nearly falling in love with a lesbian I don't want to make the same mistake again, so we can knock off another 10%. That leaves 1.8million. If I can meet just one during my four months away - and God knows I'm going to try - that would make the whole thing worthwhile.\"</p> <p> <strong>Laura</strong><br> \"Ever since I can remember I've always wanted to dance - I've just never known how. I don't mean jigging around on a dancefloor to da riddims or a wedding singer; I'm talking about real dance - a fast-moving lindy hop, a rump-rolling rumba or a pirouette par excellence. I need to stretch more than my legs and learn to swing, kick, jump and sway, with a sultry look and a nonchalant toss of the hips and hair.</p> <p>\"I want you to send me to tango in Buenos Aires, to salsa through Havana, and to Vienna to learn how to waltz. I want the best teachers in Seville to show me a real flamenco and be taught to tap dance down Broadway. I'm tired of sitting in the stalls with twitching limbs when I could be up on stage swanning around in a tutu... </p> <p>\"I want to work hard, to drop at the end of the day exhausted and exhilarated. I need to learn that I'm not too old and it's not too late. There's just one proviso if I go, please don't send me line dancing. Formation boot twisting in a Stetson just ain't sexy and, frankly, I'd rather chop off one of my two left feet.\"</p> <p><strong>Meg, 29</strong><br> \"Sometimes it's tough being a vegan in Scarborough, north Yorkshire. It's not that restaurant owners don't understand what a vegan is (it is after all, a simple concept), but rather that they don't understand what makes a good vegan meal (and I can tell you now - it's not a baked potato with beans). For too long the mention of the word 'vegan' has conjured up images of thick wholemeal pastry filled with dry flavourless lentils.</p> <p>\"That's why I lust after four months of pure unadulterated vegan culinary bliss. I want to break free from Scarborough's lardy chip culture, and experience the finest traditional vegan meals in the world.\"</p> <p><strong>Riikka, 31</strong><br> \"...I find Russia deeply bewitching and want to get to know this huge, mysterious country and to understand the different aspects of Russian culture. It will be an especially challenging adventure for me because I see the world from the height of my four-foot stature. Being a small person gives you a different perspective on even the most ordinary sights. Just imagine what it must be like when your eye level is at other people's bums. Or how difficult it is to try to withdraw money from the cash machine when you cannot see the screen even when you stand on your toes.\"</p> <p><strong>Emily, 30</strong><br> \"It is more a flare-up of my conscience which makes me genuinely want to take that step further. My dream would be to offer readers (hopefully in a non-patronising, non-worthy way!) a real insight into two communities and two conservational projects in four continents. I would spend the first three weeks researching and caring for wolves and shepherd dogs in the mountains of Bulgaria. The following two consecutive months would see me helping an East African community in their quest to build a school and hospital, before moving on to an orphanage in Nepal. Finally, the last five weeks would spirit me onwards to South America to sweat while studying rare and endangered species alongside a local indigenous community in the Amazonian jungle.</p> <p>\"If I was chosen as a Netjetter it would bring me the depth and experience to open my eyes beyond my current safe existence. For my husband, his life would be infinitely more bearable minus my nagging...\"</p> <p> <strong>Julie, 59</strong><br> \"I want to travel from Punta Arenas, southern tip of South America, to Anchorage in the north of the USA. I will clean people's houses as I go. </p> <p>\"Why? Well I'm not some sort of anal-fixated fan of cleanliness, it's just that everyone I know needs a cleaner, no one can find one and what better way to see a whole continent than by cleaning, and staying in its private homes? Oh! and making people happy as I go.</p> <p>\"No hotels or backpackers' for me ... I will spend two hours everyday cleaning different homes along the way, doing a bit of honest work in exchange for a bed and some breakfast.

I love the noises they make, the way they look and their easy attitude towards travelling. In the absence of doors and windows the passenger can really get involved with the surroundings, while its slow speed and small size make for an enlightening experience on busy roads where weight and velocity are ruling factors in road politics. Tuk tuks appear to be in constant state of change; rickshaw garages with frames and spare parts clutter the roadsides in abundance. It is my dream to drive a tuk tuk on an epic journey.\"</p> <p><strong>Simon, 27</strong><br> \"It seemed grandad had no adventures of his own. Modesty prevented his revealing the true reason he was 'mentioned in dispatches' for bravery. His generation's stiff upper lip meant he merely referred to 'a walk' that he undertook before liberation as a PoW - never disclosing that this was a gun point march across half of Europe in the coldest winter of the century. </p> <p>\"For my Netjetters trip I would like to follow the route of my grandad's second world war expeditions - honouring his life and countless others, by adding the colours of his unclaimed medal ribbons to black and white photos and brown memories. My grandad reluctantly made this journey to fight for freedom and peace. I would love and relish the opportunity to use this freedom so expensively won to see these countries in the peaceful times that he sacrificed his youth for.\"</p> <p> <strong>Emily</strong><br> \"Due to economic pressure, Transport for London wishes to remove the iconic double-decker from the streets replacing it with a more modern, higher capacity bus. The loss would be unimaginable as the Routemaster is simply more than just 'a bus'.</p> <p>\"To prove this, I propose to drive the Routemaster overland from London to Shanghai stopping in cities, towns and villages along the way to gain worldwide support; this fantastic driving adventure would be shared with Guardian readers.

  "<p> 28 Polperro Gardens</p> <p>Wood Green</p> <p>London</p> <p>N.22</p> <p>March 30th 1974</p> <p>Wednesday</p> <p>Dear Janus</p> <p>I am very sorry that I have not been able to see you, or even write to you before this. I have been rather ill - since Sunday afternoon, in fact. I've had a very bad cold combined with asthma and have hardly been able to breathe. After a visit to the doctor's on Tuesday morning I was given a great variety of pills etc and am now a little better. (Lobo is crawling over me.) (I'll have to stop for a moment as she now wants to go out.) Of course, not being at work, I am imprisoned here in this box impersonating a room (I hope I'm going to get paid from work as I'm skint). Still, I am hoping that I shall be able to come and see you on Friday. If I don't, I hope that you will write to me as soon after you receive this letter as possible. I shall look forward to it!</p> <p> Of course, what with so many demons flying around forcing gentlemen such as us to take too many drinks and whoop too loud and too often and even more strange and ludicrous actions! And even the changing of names as the mad women of Tierrapaulita do (to change themselves) does not one bit of good - and the changing of Billbaorosta or Januscjeckarama to: violas one day or violets the next or even after a while cirfrusias, cifrernas, tirrenas, mabrofordotas, frabicias, fabiolas, quitanias, pasquinas, shoposas, zozimas, zangoras and that's the end of the alphabet! (apart from the missing tenaquilas and pogaliras). So think not of changing, my friend, (name or anything) and be damned to devils! For happy are those who whoopeth too loud and delirious are those who ludicrous are!</p> <p>Now I have heard it said that the natives in the Northern part of Windhover Hill (so far unexplored) speak of a most monstrous Red Lion, that lives in those parts, and its roars can be heard echoing about the eucalyptus and Banyan trees in the valley of the source of the Limpopo. To my mind it is in the national interest that an expedition to discover the Red Lion must be mounted but that it should be properly funded. Many pleas to the Royal Geographical society have been fruitless so far and others snatch away the mountains of the Shangri-las but to the valley of the Red Lion a path must soon be made, and it is we that shall make it. </p> <p>I hope very much so that dear Scipplecat is well and happy and I hope that you will convey my best regards to the aforesaid furry creature. Lobo also sends her best wishes.</p> <p>Now look after yourself JJ and take care till I see you again. I'm afraid coughing and spluttering I must bring this letter to its terrible and inevitable end.</p> <p>Try not to drink too much till I see you.</p> <p>You must save some money so that we can go a-boozing.</p> <p>(Lobo is sitting on my head, my nose is full of whiskers)</p> <p>I think the drink is getting the better of this letter</p> <p>PAX Vobiscum</p> <p>Lobo says goodbye for now</p> <p>also adios from myself</p> <p>Bill</p> <p>Janus didn't usually leave his letters from Bill lying around, but this one had been left on the kitchen table, out of its envelope, half-unfolded, beside the glass cider tankard that held a posy of wilting daffodils, in a way that suggested, to Colette at least, that she was being invited, along with anyone else in the house, to read it.</p> <p>And so she had read it, alone in the kitchen, waiting for Aldous to return after a morning at school to get ready for the funeral that afternoon. It was written in a painstakingly rendered Gothic script using a broad, italic nib and illustrated with exquisite marginal drawings. It was like a drunkard's version of the Book of Kells. The 'D' of 'Dear Janus' had been drawn as a D-shaped pub, with a little chimney, creeping ivy and an inn-sign hanging (she even recognised the decapitated Elizabethan on the sign as The Quiet Woman). The remainder of the word had been supplemented by a punning human ear, painted in such pure, Renaissance detail it could have been lifted from a Botticelli portrait. All around the margins of the letter were pen and ink drawings of almost-empty bottles and glasses, some tipped over and spilling the last of their contents, but again drawn beautifully. By the end of the letter the calligraphy, so crisp and rigid at the beginning, had broken down into a scruffy, barely legible scrawl, though Bill's signature was accompanied by what looked like a woodcut, in blood-red ink, of a clenched fist.</p> <p>Colette tried to imagine the time it must have taken to produce a letter like this, picturing her son-in-law sitting at the little writing desk she'd seen in his and Juliette's bedroom, that was a small forest of pens and brushes, bottles of ink, little wrinkled tubes of watercolour, boxes of nibs. It must have taken him several evenings. An act of devotion. Colette found the sheer effort Bill had put into this letter to her son rather touching. At least someone in the world loved him. </p> <p>By the time Aldous had come home, fresh and fluffy from cycling, Colette had long finished reading the letter, but she pretended to be reading it for the first time as he came in, to make it easier for her to show it to him. </p> <p>But Aldous only gave the letter a cursory glance, reading the first few lines, and admiring Bill's graphic skills, giving a half-hearted, rather hopeless laugh at the D-shaped pub, before handing the letter back to his wife.</p> <p>'What a load of rubbish,' he sighed, strolling towards the sink to fill a small saucepan with water. Colette felt briefly annoyed by her husband's indifference. He might not like the way his son had been behaving recently, the drunken tantrums, the wanton neglect of his talents as a pianist, but he could at least be interested in him. For the sake of the funeral they were to attend that day, however, she decided to be on his side.</p> <p>'At least he won't be around to spoil things today,' she said, folding the letter, wondering if she should replace it on the table as though it had never been touched, then realising her son could hardly expect her to have ignored it for a whole day, 'thank Christ he went to work.'</p> <p>'I wouldn't put it past him to turn up out of the blue,' said Aldous, lighting a ring beneath the pan he'd just filled, 'you know how he gets if he thinks there's a chance of free drink.'</p> <p>They both recalled Christine's wedding, a couple of years before - the trampled-on wedding cake, the shattered bouquets, the drenched, sobbing bridesmaids.</p> <p>'He won't,' said Colette, 'he doesn't even know the funeral's today.'</p> <p>Aldous gave his wife a withering look, meaning to say you could never be sure what Janus knew and what he didn't.</p> <p>'So it will be just you and me representing the Jones family,' Colette said, 'I hope there aren't lots of our nephews and nieces there, it'll make our children look so mean ...'</p> <p>The funeral of Mary, the wife of Colette's favourite brother, Janus Brian, was not thought worthy of James breaking his second term as an anthropology student at the University of Lincoln, nor of Juliette losing a day's pay at Eve St John's Toy Emporium, nor even of Julian, their youngest, missing out on double geography and P.E. at St Francis Xavier's. Of all their children Janus would have been the one most likely to have taken a day off work, had he known about it.</p> <p>Aldous took a small package of newspaper from his jacket pocket, untwisted it, and tipped the contents into a mug. He hadn't had a chance to use it at school, the instant coffee powder he always packed at the last minute before leaving the house for work, tearing off a corner of the Telegraph and spooning on some Maxwell House, folding the paper over in a neat, airtight package, the clever origami of which always delighted his wife when she saw it. He emptied the bubbling saucepan into the mug. They hadn't had a kettle for years. The little, lidless, gaudily enamelled pots that came to a boil with a gradually strengthening wail of despair, always seemed to boil dry, thus melting the cheap alloys of their bases. So they only used pans now. </p> <p>'Do you think I should wear a black tie?' said Aldous, sipping cautiously the black, sugarless coffee.</p> <p>Colette sat down in her chair by the old cast iron boiler and opened a bottle of Gold Label barley wine with the bottleopening end of a tin opener.</p> <p>'Have you got a black tie?'</p> <p>'No.'</p> <p>'Then the question was academic, was it?'</p> <p>'I suppose I could buy one on the way. You know what Janus Brian's like. How fussy he is about formalities like that ...'</p> <p>That their eldest son, and Colette's closest brother shared the same name, had never once been a source of confusion in their lives. At least, not once they'd started using her brother's middle name in addition to his first, to help distinguish him. Now he was always referred to by these two names - Janus Brian - even when there was no doubt about to whom the name Janus referred, even, sometimes, to his face - Hello Janus Brian, how are you? And Janus Brian didn't seem to mind. It was, after all, a permanent reminder of the compliment his sister had paid him in naming her first-born after him.</p> <p>'I don't think he'd mind about a thing like that,' said Colette, 'I'm not wearing any black.'</p> <p>'Women can get away with it,' said Aldous, 'men are different. They read things into ties, especially men like Janus Brian.'</p> <p>Colette poured the Gold Label into a glass, where it fizzed half-heartedly, her second of the day. Colette had taken to this tipple recently, initially as a sedative, to reinforce the ever-weakening effect of her sleeping pills. She would drink two or three glasses in the evening, then take four or five Nembutals (the recommended dose was two), which would despatch her to a deep, dreamless sleep for eight hours. The problem was that awakening was a long, slow painful struggle. She woke as if from a pit of glue, always with a pounding headache and sensations of nausea, the only cure for which, she soon found, was a morning glass of barley wine. One of those and she was near instantly awake and fresh. A sedative in the evening, a pickme-up in the morning. Barley wine was her wonder-drink.</p> <p>Aldous looked at himself in the little mirror that was fixed to the wall by the back door. His tie was pale blue. His shirt a dark grey, fraying at the collar. A jacket of light tweed. His teaching clothes. He hadn't thought about it before, but it now struck him that he couldn't possibly go to a funeral in his teaching clothes. Standards of dress among the pupils at the school Aldous had taught at for nearly three decades had declined rapidly in the last few years, a wave of slightly bashful permissiveness had allowed hair to creep over collars, ties to be worn loosely, top buttons to be left undone, and shoes of the ridiculously elevated kind to be worn, the effect being to give Aldous a distorted sense of his own sartorial smartness. Against the haystack slovenliness of his pupils he had appeared dapperly elegant, but here, in the mirror, he could see how inappropriate his clothes would be for a funeral. He needed a decent tie, at least.</p> <p>'I think I will get a new tie,' he said to Colette, who was dressed in the pink pullover with white trimmings she had knitted years ago for Juliette, to which she'd pinned one of her mother's old fake ruby brooches. She had dark blue trousers, green sandals, 'I'll call at Houseman's on the way.'</p> <p>Houseman's was a gentleman's outfitters on the Parade. In the days when Aldous and Colette had had some money Aldous had bought all his clothes from there, though as money had become increasingly scarce, his visits had become less frequent, until he only ever went there now for underwear, making do with jackets, shirts and trousers from the Oxfam shop that had recently opened near The Red Lion.</p> <p>'If you must,' said Colette, 'though it'll be a waste of time and money.'</p> <p>Though secretly she was glad of the distraction and delay a detour to Houseman's would take, since she was dreading the funeral. Or at least, she was dreading the actual interment, the lowering of the coffin into the grave. Janus Brian had chosen a spot for his wife in Ladore Lane Cemetery just across the path from where their mother and their sister Meg were buried. Colette found visiting these graves a painful experience at the best of times, that their deaths, both from natural causes (old age and a heart attack), had come so close together (Nana first, then Meg) had been a source of anguish in Colette's life. To be there for another funeral, to witness the lowering of a coffin when it had troubled her so much before (so deep, so dreadfully deep) might, she feared, prove too much for her to bear. On the other hand, she was looking forward to the little gathering that was to take place at Janus Brian's house afterwards, a meeting of sisters and brothers, brothers and sons, wives and daughters. It was so rare for them all to be gathered in a single place, especially with Janus Brian, who had become very reclusive in recent years. Though he lived only a mile away from Colette, visits to his house in Leicester Avenue, a cul-de-sac of pebbledashed semis, were often coldly received, and rarely reciprocated. In fact, he only ever visited Colette to announce one thing - the imminence of his own death.</p> <p>'Nothing funny about it dear. This is it,' he said once when Colette opened the front door to see him standing on the step in his work clothes (a dark suit with a narrow black tie), 'my number's up. Will you get off the floor?' Colette had got down on her knees in mock worship at her brother's feet. </p> <p>It had happened several times, usually as a result of reading some health article or other, that Janus Brian would discover symptoms in himself of a fatal disease. Now she couldn't even remember what it had been. An innocent pimple, wart, or pedunculated polyp. A benign confusion of cells. A temporary thinning of the blood. As with most hypochondriacs, however, Janus Brian remained annoyingly free of real illness. </p> <p>Then, only last week, he'd called at the house in his dark suit and Colette had poured ironic gratitude on his presence, unrolling an invisible red carpet, forming a solo guard of honour, kissing him on both cheeks like a Russian at a superpower summit, before she noticed how Janus Brian's countenance had fallen. His face was a game of Kerplunk and someone had just extracted the crucial straw sending all the marbles tumbling. Colette thought that perhaps death really was coming for him now, after a dozen false alarms. But it was not his own death that Janus Brian had come to announce - it was that of his wife.</p>",
  "<p>It's hard to imagine the joy and pleasure that having a donkey in your garden can give to a small boy. In truth, he was a rather raggedy, slightly flea-bitten thing (the four-legged fellow, I mean) but he was amiable, eager for attention and, to a 14-month-old, he was a purebred white Arabian stallion. He is a boy of few words (well, two actually - \"dof\" and, we know not why, \"bugger\"), but they and, his burgeoning pointing skills, were employed to full effect every time Monsieur Donkey emerged from the shade of the trees to blink in the warm French sunshine and in the adoration of a little chap.</p> <p>But you couldn't really blame the poor child for being so impressed - somehow everything seems better in the light of a sunny French afternoon. Lie back on an empty French beach or in the garden of your homely gite, only \"dof!\" and \"bugger!\" punctuating the peace, and all is very much right with the world. </p> <p>In truth, if you follow our lead, it won't begin like that. Most family holidays involve some level of compromise and ours was the fact that we chose to start with the ferry from Portsmouth. The ferry can be very pleasant. Portsmouth cannot. A couple of hours looking for something that didn't involve strong lager and Sky TV and we were longing to begin the unfathomable process of loading up the ferry - the selection procedure for who actually gets on the ferry nice and early and who waits for hours listening to a CD of children's songs is a mystery to the finest minds - but the voyage itself can be a very pleasant way to drink a few drinks, shop a bit and eat some fairly palatable nosh, while listening to enthusiastic musicians. </p> <p>If you take a nipper and you journey overnight, in the name of all that's holy, double check your cabin. On the way back the cabin was spacious enough to squeeze in a travel cot. On the way out it wasn't so we had to use the one the boat provides. They are not cots. They are laundry baskets. Small ones. No one will sleep. A wink.</p> <p>But even a bleary-eyed emergence into St Malo is a great pleasure. Ferry ports can make lovely towns after all, the city walls and yacht-stuffed marina give off an air of welcome and a sense of the obliging that actually comes as something of a shock. But you can potter round the cobbled streets, munch your galettes and sit in any number of the little bars and bistros of St Malo on your way back. For now, we're heading off to Huelgoat.</p> <p>We were actually staying in the tiny hamlet of Coat Mocun, just outside the small market town of Huelgoat, both to be found in the centre of Brittany in among the farms and forests of an area characterised as the Parc D'Amorique. Lush and picturesque and half asleep, much of the area had decreed that the holiday season was over (in the first week of September). </p> <p>The roads were quiet - or at least you were more likely to be stuck behind a walnut-faced local farmer driving a tractor than a ruddy-faced Brit towing a caravan - the shops were retreating into eccentric opening hours and my halting (almost reversing) French was greeted with cheery surprise rather than weary resignation. And it was fabulous. In these days of unpredictable weather, the end of the holiday season is as likely to be hot as the middle (and was), so the sense of sneaking yourself a secret treat in the empty streets of Brittany's small towns adds a layer of smug satisfaction to a trip.</p> <p>The gite was spacious, well-equipped (if you don't mind pre-loved kitchen utensils) and had been taking guests since 1955 so pretty much everything had been catered for. Even according to the guest book, down to providing a sensational selection of moths. We saw none worthy of note, but one enthusiast listed his top twenty sightings. A guest book can be an uncomfortable peek into the minds of others. But comfy as we were, moths or no, the beaches were calling.</p> <p>The west coast can be simply breathtaking. Camarat, Pentrez and Douarmenez can all treat you to impressive open spaces of white sand and the rolling Atlantic. It could have been the eccentricities of the holiday season, but the beaches were almost empty, pockmarked with French and English families, patiently filling and emptying buckets for their smaller members or watching as the more adventurous offspring headed off to sea or to the rock-pools to do battle with spume and crabs. </p> <p>If you want old-fashioned family values, here they are. The innocent pleasures of fresh air, collecting pebbles, pulling seaweed from your toes and slurping ice cream are here in all their refreshing glory. Long days watching footballs gather speed as they head towards the tides end with the rhythm of shoes battered against the footwells of cars, the little piles of loosened sand in the vacated car parks testaments to the sort of days your parents relished.</p> <p>The favourite, though, was Port Manech on the southern coast of Brittany. A tiny strip of beach, strewn with seaweed, it looked less promising at first, but the shelter the bay provides, the backdrop of a fairytale village and forest perched on rocky promontories and the warm sea lapping the toes soon wins you over. That bucket and spade got some hammer that day.</p> <p>As you swoop onto Port Manech, you cannot ignore the splendid Concarneau, another walled city, another port, but you can't fail to be impressed by the seafood restaurants (and admittedly, tacky souvenir shops) that inhabit the cobbled streets that form part of the old fortifications. Even at our end of the season, hordes of tourists parade up and down with a strange solemnity peering at menus, examining pottery. Tourism is, its seems, something to be taken seriously.</p> <p>But heading north again, back to the heart of the region lies Trevarez Castle, a place of enormous stupidity. Not only is it a splendidly ludicrous early 20th century Gothic folly of such malevolence and gloom that you expect Scooby Doo and Shaggy to pass quivering by, but that foolishness was compounded by the housing there, in the second world war, of Japanese and German submariners, a good 30 miles from the sea and in the most glaring target the bombers could see for miles. Inside the castle, a video constantly loops a Sino-German sports day, interrupted by some very serious bombing.</p> <p>Each day of a family holiday is the choice between the beach (for the nipper) and the restaurants, towns and castles for the parents. Next year we'll start to lose a few more of those arguments (we already lost some and he can't even speak). But for now, the biggest defeat for us was the unfathomable thought processes of French road signs (are they still trying to thwart Nazi invasion?) and the ineffable sadness that is saying \"bugger\" and waving goodbye to a donkey.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong> </p> <p>Jimmy travelled with Brittan Ferries from Portsmouth to St Malo.

  "Women were warned about a new date-rape threat today after a Swansea nightclubber was apparently attacked after smoking a spiked cigarette. <p>The 30-year-old woman is believed to be the first British victim of \"fry\" cigarettes - tobacco dipped in embalming fluid - a practice which first came to attention in the US state of North Carolina in the late 1990s.</p> <p>Graham Rhodes, chief executive of the Roofie Foundation, which campaigns on behalf of sex crime victims, warned women not to \"accept a casual cigarette from anyone\". He said taking cigarettes offered on a night out should be considered as dangerous as accepting a drink from a stranger.</p> <p>The Swansea woman was given the cigarette at a club last week and told police she began to feel \"giddy and disorientated\". One of the two men she was talking to offered to take her home in a taxi but the next thing she remembered was waking up alone in a guest house, having been raped.</p> <p>A 39-year-old man from Ebbw Vale, 50 miles from Swansea, was later arrested.</p> <p>Dr Jim Campbell, a former Home Office forensic scientist who carries out work for the Roofie Foundation, said that on its own, a drugged cigarette was unlikely to be enough to allow a sex attack. However, a woman who was normally unlikely to accept a drink from a stranger would be more ready to take one while under the temporary influence of embalming fluid. The liquid is a mixture of formaldehyde and alcohol which has an almost instantaneous effect.</p> <p>\"You will feel giddy and may go into a stupor, but it will not last very long and will not incapacitate anyone,\" Dr Campbell said. \"It will not affect the memory either so it does not have many of the effects of a date-rape drug.\"</p> <p>But Rape Crisis Online http://www.rapecrisisonline.com/DateRapeDrugs.htm - a North Carolina website - suggests the dangers could be far greater. \"Sometimes, the compound used in the fry cigarettes is PCP,\" it says. \"This drug adds an incredible level of danger to the user - it can kill.\"</p> <p>The website adds: \"According to a 1998 study by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse, those who smoke fry cigarettes experience toxic psychosis, hallucinations, delusions, and sometimes, unconsciousness. Some men who were interviewed for the study said that \"you can control a girl more than you can with Rohypnol\". Others stated that the drug heightens a woman's sexual appetite. \"</p>",
  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to Westminster. <p><b> FROM BOURNEMOUTH</b></p> <p>The Backbencher bumped into Guardian sketchwriter Simon Hoggart on the Bournemouth seafront and asked him how he found this year's Lib Dem conference.</p> <p>\"To say a Liberal Democrat conference has been exciting is a gross exaggeration in any year. But this year it's certainly had a lot more going for it and there's been a lot more zip and pizzazz than we normally get. And that's because it's almost certainly the last conference before the coming general election, and the Lib Dems feel that they're in with a real chance of doing very well indeed. A few decades ago, the party was down to just six seats, but this time it could well reach 60, 70 or even 100.</p> <p>\"The party leadership has been trying to dampen down that kind of speculation. They know that in politics, discounting is everything - if you claim you are about to become second and then you don't, you look like an abject failure. So they want to predict a fairly normal, humdrum, run-of-the-mill result, which in reality will look dazzlingly successful. But they haven't been entirely successful - because these people really do believe that they're in with a chance of destroying the Conservatives as a fighting force in British politics.</p> <p>\"The problem for the leadership is that to do that, they have to win more Tory-held seats than Labour ones. And that seems likely too. In spite of their great success recently in inner city seats, the fact is that it is Tory seats which are most vulnerable to the Lib Dems. Almost all their top 10 target seats are presently held by Tories, so what they're having to do is to move to the right.</p> <p>\"Now everyone says that rightwing and leftwing are meaningless terms these days, which may be true, but what they want to do is become tougher on law and order than the Tories. They want to be more free-market and less geared towards social engineering than Labour. In other words, much more like a safe, cuddly, ameliorative version of the Conservatives. And that will offend a lot of their people. </p> <p>\"They've always been traditionally rather to the left and quite radical, very keen on the environment and certainly extremely sympathetic on law and order. So it's going to be quite a difficult struggle for the leadership to send wild signals to the electorate that the party is just a nicer version of the Tories - while keeping on board their army of loyal people who stuff envelopes, knock on doors and do the hard work of an election campaign.</p> <p>\"People have always had their doubts about Charles Kennedy, and they were exacerbated around a year ago when he seemed to have that health wobble and there were stories of him - not being an alcoholic, exactly, but there was the sense that it was rather like Mastermind - \"once I've started, now I'll finish\" - that once he'd decided to have a few drinks, he had quite a few. But he seems to have reined that in pretty well and he now has a tradition of opening the party conference with a drinks party for journalists at which he's the only one who doesn't drink.</p> <p>\"In any case, in the run-up to an election, party leaders are in a blissful position. No one can get rid of them as the last thing anyone wants is a leadership contest. If they do disappointingly next time - I'd say if they don't get an increase in the order of 20-30 seats - then Charlie is safe. If, heaven forbid, they actually lose seats, I think he'd go quietly, while if they did better than hoped (getting 100+ seats) then you'd see him absolutely set - there for as long as he wants the job.\"</p> <p><b> LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>There were almost as many different answers to this question as there were entries, with readers suggesting that MPs have voted on foxhunting as few as two or as many as 11 times. However, the most comprehensive summary came from Stephen Bowden. \"Not counting today's session, MPs have voted on hunting in connection with six Bills since world war two,\" he writes, before going on to list all six occasions. \"Of course the total number of individual votes is much greater than this, what with second readings and the odd third reading, and amendments at report stage, and occasional outbreaks of Bicameral Ping-Pong.\" Let's all be grateful Tony is trying to outlaw that sort of thing and simplify parliamentary democracy for us.</p> <p><b> THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>The 38-year-old Lib Dem \"young Turk\" and Niles Crane look-alike David \"Making\" Laws seems to have taken a vow of silence since his suggestion that the NHS be replaced by a compulsory insurance scheme so infuriated party activists. But he hasn't always been so quiet. To win a copy of Rex Wyler's forthcoming GreenPeace: How a Group of Ecologists, Journalists and Visionaries Changed the World (published by <a href=\"http://www.rodale.co.uk\">Rodale</a>), simply tell the Backbencher how a teenaged Mr Laws first proved his future oratorical talents in 1984.

Terms and conditions for the competition can be inspected <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/backbench/story/0,14158,1151064,00.html\">here</a>.</p> <p><b> RITES OF BILL</b></p> <p>\"Saint Clinton is not endorsed nor sanctioned by the former president,\" warns the small print at <a href=\"http://www.saintclinton.com\">SaintClinton.com</a>. Indeed not. The Backbencher certainly hopes Bill's hospital facilities don't include a laptop. The shock of seeing Scott Ritcher's poster, with its radiant heart, might undo the good work of the doctors at New York Presbyterian. \"His timeless, sympathetic words, 'I feel your pain', echo in his reassuring expression,\" explains the site. As for the coaster (USD6) and the lunchbox (USD18) - well, frankly the Backbencher was hoping for a humidor with the ex-president's image, but the best the site can offer is a coffee mug showing US budget deficits since 1901 in graphical format (USD14). Still, the I Love Abortion thong might just give Dick Cheney another heart attack.</p> <p><b> EYES, RIGHT?</b></p> <p>\"I require your help to settle a debate,\" emails a young reader from Heriot-Watt university. \"On <a href=\"http://www2.harrow.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.asp?UID=70\">Harrow council's website</a>, is Eileen Kinnear, Conservative councillor for Harrow on the Hill, wearing glasses or not?\" James, the Backbencher is sure there's a perfectly good explanation for this photograph, but she is currently unable to supply it.</p> <p><b> WISH YOU WERE HERE</b></p> <p>There is nothing the Backbencher enjoys more than kicking off her kitten heels, slipping on a comfy pair of sandals and heading down to the Liberal Democrat conference in Bournemouth. Who would miss this lunchtime's fringe meetings? Hot topics include: how to defuse the obesity time bomb; the public health priority of positive parenting; and encouraging public involvement in the lottery.</p> <p><b> BEYOND OUR KEN</b></p> <p>She was disappointed, however by Ken Livingstone's cancellation of his fringe meeting today, with Lib Dems muttering darkly that he is \"running scared\" of defending his 20% hike in bus fares. After defeating Simon Hughes by a mere 400,000 votes in June's mayoral elections, the Backbencher can understand why Ken would be so nervous.</p> <p><b> THE BOURNEMOUTH IDENTITY</b></p> <p>Conference security has also not met with her satisfaction. A cursory glance into your handbag by a pensioner is hardly adequate defence against Osama bin Laden, let alone Otis Ferry. Don't these people know that Charles Kennedy is going to be our next prime minister? As one hack was heard to observe while being waved through the entrance, \"this really feels like a party on the brink of power\".</p> <p><b> INDY MEDIA?</b></p> <p>As a devout Guardian reader, the Backbencher has found it hard to escape the Independent's sponsorship of the conference. Its logo is plastered everywhere - on stewards' sweatshirts, delegates' bags and, she assumes, a large cheque made payable to the Lib Dems. What's more, readers of the newspaper have been treated to an unusually thorough analysis of the Lib Dems' prospects. It's good to see the paper living up to its title.</p> <p><b> STOKOE'D UP</b></p> <p>After a prolonged period of silence, Simon Hughes' right-hand man during his failed mayoral bid gets in touch. \"Hope all is well and you enjoyed the break,\" the hapless Richard Stokoe emails. Not really, Richard, but the Backbencher can be a bit of a workaholic. \"Just when you thought it was safe to escape from me, you will be pleased to hear (possible anyhow) that I am now back from my gardening leave and now working over at City Hall for the delightful yellows. If you need any insights into workings in the great glass monolith then please feel free to drop me a line or a bell.\" Right now, Richard, there's nothing that springs to mind - although the Backbencher has been wondering exactly who was responsible for the soothing beige carpet and glowing Lib Dem bird at this year's conference: they really should be accompanied by the slogan \"Bringing Politics Home\" - but if any readers have any Lib Dems-in-London related queries, she urges them to get in touch with her. Richard's waiting for her call.</p> <p><b> SURPRISE, SURPRISE</b></p> <p>Finally, the Backbencher's attention was drawn to the Name The October Surprise website, which invites readers to come up with the most plausible treat Dubya will pull out of the electoral hat before the presidential election. Dragging Osama bin Laden from his hole is a possibility, of course. But what else might he get away with? Shortlisted entries will be published at the end of September, with any \"winners\" rewarded on October 30 with a live appearance on Air America.

  "<p>The ITV Digital catastrophe of two years ago continued to reverberate today with the Football League launching legal action against the solicitors who advised them on the deal. </p> <p>Many clubs outside the top-flight were left in financial limbo after ITV Digital went into administration in March 2002 owing \u00a3178.5m for the remaining two seasons of their contract with the League. </p> <p>Some clubs soon ended up in administration and the League are now suing Hammonds Solicitors for alleged negligence or breach of contract - though the law firm intend to \"vigorously contest\" the action. Hammonds also deny suggestions that they have previously discussed a settlement with the League. </p> <p>The Football League chairman, Sir Brian Mawhinney, confirmed today that High Court proceedings had been issued against Hammonds, previously known as Edge Ellison, the legal advisors to the League during contract negotiations with ITV Digital in 2000. The last legal action by the League over the ITV Digital contract ended in defeat two years ago when it failed in its efforts to make ITV parent companies Carlton and Granada pay up instead. </p> <p>The League released a statement today which read: \"The League's board of directors have taken this decision having considered detailed advice from leading counsel. The League's proceedings claim that during the negotiation and completion of its broadcasting agreement with ITV Digital (at the relevant time known as ONDigital), Hammonds were negligent and/or in breach of contract and failed to protect the League's interests. They include a claim for substantial damages.\"</p> <p>The deal struck in June 2000 gave ONDigital the right to broadcast Football League matches for three seasons from 2001-02, but in the already-inflated TV market it proved prohibitively costly. Television audiences for matches were often outnumbered by crowds at the games, and the TV channel collapsed after less than a season. </p> <p>A statement from Hammonds read: \"The proceedings are without merit and will be vigorously contested. Contrary to recent press speculation, at no time have we entered into discussions with the Football League on settlement of this dispute. </p> <p>\"We are clear about the extent of our role in providing legal advice to the Football League in connection with the League's negotiations with ITV Digital in 2000 and we are satisfied that we performed our duties fully and with the utmost professional care.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was inevitable. One day Silas would run into someone from the past, someone who had been in a position of power and had abused it. Someone who had affected his life, not in the vague, rather grand way in which everybody had been affected, as people said, because power corrupts even the best of men, but directly and brutally. Good men had done all kinds of things they could not help doing, because they had been corrupted by all the power someone or something had given them.</p> <p>'Bullshit,' Silas thought. It's always something or someone else who's responsible, a 'larger scheme of things' that exonerates people from taking responsibility for the things they do. </p> <p>Silas watched the man, the strands of thinning hair combed all the way across his head to hide his baldness, the powdery residue of dry and dying skin on the collar of his jacket, the slight paunch, the grey Pick 'n Pay shoes, the matching grey socks. The man leaned forward to push something along the check-out counter, and turned his face towards where Silas stood, holding a can of tomatoes in his hands like an arrested gesture. Yes, it was Du Boise. Francois du Boise. The same alertness in his blue eyes. A bit slower, though, Silas thought, as Du Boise moved his head from side to side, watching the cashier ring up his purchases.</p> <p>Silas went closer, accidentally jostling a woman in the queue behind Du Boise. Silas watched him pushing his groceries along, even though the cashier was capable of doing this on the conveyor belt. Typical pensioner's fare. 'No-name brand' cans of beans, tuna, long-life milk, sliced white bread, instant coffee, rooibos tea, denture cream. </p> <p>So the bastard's lost his teeth.</p> <p>Silas pictured Lydia's angry face, were he to return home without groceries. Today's Sunday and the shops are open only until one o'clock. She'd suppose out loud that she'd have to do the shopping the next day, because his job was too important to allow him to take time off from work. All the same, he abandoned the trolley and followed Du Boise out of the store. Halfway down the length of the mall, past shop windows that Du Boise occasionally stopped to look into with familiar ease, Silas began to ask himself what the hell he thought he was doing, following a retired security policeman about in a shopping centre? What Du Boise had done, he had done a long time ago. Nineteen years. And Silas had learned to live with what Du Boise had done, had absorbed that moment's horror into the flow of his life, a faded moon of a memory that only occasionally intruded into his everyday consciousness. Why did it matter now, when the situation was reversed, and Silas could use the power of his own position to make the old bastard's life hell?</p> <p>The man's smell, a faint stench of decaying metabolism, was in Silas's nostrils, as if he were a hunter come suddenly upon his wounded prey. Du Boise stopped at a cafe, pulled a chair out from under the table, ready to sit down. Silas stood close to him, facing him, and suffered a moment of uncertainty. Shit, this man looked so much older than the Du Boise he remembered. Then he looked - startled - into the man's equally startled eyes.</p> <p>'Du Boise? Lieutenant Du Boise?'</p> <p>'Yes?' he said, and looked Silas up and down, his bewildered manner changing to one of annoyance. He sat down, uttering a weary sigh, trying to draw the attention of other shoppers. Look, here was a youngster bothering an old man, a pensioner.</p> <p>'Do you remember me?' Silas asked. </p> <p> Du Boise leaned back in his chair, his air of open-armed, I'm-being-put-upon vulnerability quickly bringing a security guard closer.</p> <p>'Should I?' he asked quietly, caught the eye of the security guard, then raised himself from his chair and pushed his trolley towards the exit.</p> <p>Silas watched Du Boise disappear into the bright sunlight, watched the security guard watching him, and then turned away. The rage he felt was in his stomach, an acidity that made him fart sourly, out loud, oblivious to the head-shaking group of shoppers who had gathered to witness a potential scene. The guard spoke into his radio, the caf\u00e9 owner pointedly dragged the chair back to its neat place beneath the table. Silas's rage moved disconsolately into his heart. He drove home and, without saying a word to Lydia, took a sixpack of beer from the fridge and walked up Tudhope Avenue towards the small park. He found a tiny island of green in the bristly grass. A couple of hoboes, smiling generously, moved over to make room for him to sit down, legs sprawled out. He smiled back, but ignored the obvious hint. He placed the opulent, still-sealed pack of beer between his legs, and leaned back on his elbows.</p> <p>Silas remembered how Lydia had looked up from the paper, then put it aside to watch him as he collected the beer from the fridge, walked out through the door. Her eyes had followed him as he passed the window where she sat, and when he turned to close the gate, he had seen the wariness in her face, and the tiredness. What unspoken trauma had he brought home, she must have been wondering. He felt guilty for a moment, then opened a can and drank, long deep gulps. He paused, burped, heard one of the hoboes remark that 'some people have it good in this new South Africa'. Silas turned and stared defiantly at them, then continued drinking, slow, slaking swallows, until his eyes swam and his face flushed warmly. The hoboes got up and walked away in disgust.</p> <p>At ease now, he stretched out his legs, smiled at passers-by. The park, even with its ragged lawn and fallen-down fence, provided some relief from the hot criss-cross of streets. Located on a busy intersection, it reminded him of those unexpected patches of green in the townships, where you could go without fuss. None of that 'let's go to the park' kind of ceremony that people so quickly acquired when they moved to the suburbs. Just tiny oases, where you could start off by yourself, a spontaneous decision to seek some solitariness, and the very peacefulness of you sitting on your own, sipping beer, would summon a whole group of bras to join you, all bringing along their own 'ammo'. Soon there would be a group of guys squatting in a circle and talking bra-talk, a mellifluous flow of gruff observation and counter-observation, no topic serious enough or dwelt upon sufficiently to maroon the hazy passage of a pleasurable, forgetful afternoon.</p> <p>No one pressed you for answers or confidences, you soon forgot the problem that had driven you and your pack of beer into the street, you were just one of the 'manne', deserving of your privacy. Until a wife or a mother, or a formidable duet of mother and wife, came along to tell you that this was no way to resolve your problems, drinking in the street like a kid, or worse still, like a tsotsi who had taken to petty crime because he couldn't face life. And drinking in public was a crime, petty or not.</p> <p>The worst was when the cops arrived, all cold-eyed and admonishing, revving the engine of their van until you and your friends slowly dispersed, a herd of dumb, resentful beasts being driven from a favoured waterhole.</p> <p>Silas cracked open his third beer, lay back on the grass, resting his head on the three remaining cans. The sun pressed down on his eyelids, a hot illumination that would soon make him feel drowsy. This must be the way blind people absorbed light into their heads: raising their faces to the sun, to Ra, god of the blind. Everyone needed real light, not just the artificial, thought-up light of the imagination.</p> <p>'God! You are so insensitive!' Lydia would have said, had he repeated this thought to her. An innocuous, light-hearted thought, born in a truly carefree moment. She would punish him for it. Lydia had an unforgiving mind. What went on in her heart these days? Well, he'd find out soon. Have to tell her about Du Boise. Not good at keeping secrets ... well, not really. It struck him that he and Lydia spoke very little these days, and when they did, it was about something practical, the car needing a service, the leaking taps, the length of the grass at the back of the house.</p> <p>And about Mikey. Speaking about Mikey was the closest she came to revealing herself. Not exactly pouring her heart out, but hinting at what was in there, the anxiety eating away at her calm exterior. She was always asking Silas to 'intervene', to take an active interest in his son. Hadn't he noticed how Mikey had changed, how he was no longer the easygoing kid they once knew?</p> <p>'We all grow up, Lyd, and suddenly the going's not that easy!' </p> <p>Words he would love to say, but dare not.</p> <p>'Try and speak to him, Silas, try and find out whether he's got any problems, you know, a girl, drugs, things happen to young people.'</p> <p>Meaning he doesn't speak to you, is that it?</p> <p>Someone loomed above Silas, shutting out the sun. Served him right for falling asleep in a public park in the heart of Berea. Steal your shoes off your feet, people say.</p> <p>'Dad?'</p> <p>He opened his eyes and sat up. Mikey was smiling at him in that condescending way he seemed to reserve for his father's drunkenness.</p> <p>'Dad, we have to be at Jackson and Mam Agnes's by three.'</p> <p>This was Lydia's doing, sending Mikey out to find him, to humiliate him in public, lead him home, steering him by the elbow. Well, that hadn't happened for a long time. Silas imagined Lydia telling Mikey that his grandmother would be frantic. Mam Agnes was relying on Mikey to drive her to this wedding in Lenasia, because Jackson wouldn't go with her. Mikey's grandfather is strange, the way men can be. He doesn't like Mam Agnes's Lenasia friends, not because they're Indian, but because they gossip. More likely because they don't booze, and, in any case, Jackson was probably in his 'high nines' by now.</p> <p>All of this would have been said in motherly tones, full of nagging intimacy. Mikey would have been reading, or listening to music, or sitting at the back staring into God knows what kind of nothingness. He would have looked at his mother, not pleadingly, simply to convey his annoyance, and then he would have strode out of the house to come and find Silas.</p> <p>The way he looks at me, Lydia says. As if he were the adult and I the child.</p> <p>Mikey extended a hand and helped Silas to his feet. It was a comradely gesture, Silas knew, a warning to expect nothing but cold scorn from Lydia when they got home. He farted loudly as he rose to his feet.</p> <p>'Christ, Dad!' Mikey said, and walked away. </p> <p>Silas didn't mind this anger. It brought the kind of understanding he needed and knew Lydia would not offer, a recognition of his ordinariness, his capacity for weakness, it drove the anger out of him, replaced it with a sense of fulfilment that was light, somehow, even if it was accompanied by a mortal belching and the sly emission of pungent farts.</p> <p>Simple things that helped ordinary people to cope with life. Lydia asked Mikey to drive, as if to demonstrate the need for a 'man around the house'. Usually, she wanted to drive even when Silas was sober. Women are better at these things, we don't have egos to parade. Mikey, who had only recently obtained his licence, drove now, fast and resolute on the freeway, slow and careful when they took the off-ramp to Soweto. An afternoon haze of smog turned the sun to brass. When they pulled up outside Jackson and Mam Agnes's house, Silas said he would wait in the car. The vehicle wouldn't be safe if left unguarded, and, in any case, 'You're on night duty and we can't stay long,' he said to Lydia's disappearing back. Soon, Jackson, his face burnished the colour of dark wood by a day of drinking in the sun, swaggered out through the gate, his oversized shorts flapping around his sturdy legs.</p> <p>'Sielas, Sielas, they'll steal you along with the fucken car,' Jackson said, delighting in the musical tone this emphasis gave Silas's name. 'Why don't you come in and have a drink?' Silas went inside to have a beer with his father-in-law. Mam Agnes gave the two men chiding looks, while Lydia became stony-faced. Mam Agnes, dressed 'like the queen bee in drag', according to Silas, made some remark about men who did nothing but drink beer all day, then handed Mikey the keys to Jackson's car (an old but stately Rover that 'needed a slow hand', in the words of its owner). The one thing she wished for her grandson, she said, was that he never became a beer-drinking slob.</p> <p>Mikey and Mam Agnes drove off under Jackson's watchful eye, while Lydia strode away towards their own car. Silas gulped his beer much too quickly, and joined Lydia. They drove back towards the city. His loud, exaggerated burping brought no reaction from Lydia, who concentrated on her driving, glancing at her watch all the time.</p> <p>'I saw Du Boise today.'</p> <p>'Who?'</p> <p>'Du Boise, Lieutenant Du Boise.'</p> <p>Lydia said nothing. Her fingers gripped the steering wheel more tightly.</p> <p>'Where?'</p> <p>'In the mall.'</p> <p>'Is that why we have no groceries?'</p> <p>He looked out of the window. They had emerged from the township smog. Clouds darkened the sky. He opened the window, letting in a gust of moist, refreshing air.</p> <p>'I recognized him immediately. Old and fucken decrepit, but Du Boise all right. It was his eyes. And that arrogant voice.'</p> <p>Lydia looked at him, then returned her attention to the traffic. He tried to engage her eyes, but she stared straight ahead of her.</p> <p>'You spoke to him?' she asked after a while, her enquiry casual.</p> <p>'Yes.' Again, he looked at her. She was steering the car down the off-ramp towards Doornfontein, bending her body with the curve of the road. </p> <p>'I didn't mean to. I followed him out of the store, then suddenly found him sitting down, as if he was waiting for me.'</p> <p>Lydia straightened her leaning body as the car straightened, peering into the side mirror as she entered the slow city traffic.</p> <p>'Christ, Lydia, it just happened, I just ran into him. A fucken accident.'</p> <p>She pulled the car halfway up the drive, switched off the engine and got out. Silas sat for a moment, then followed her into the house. She was already in the bedroom, pulling off her clothes.</p> <p>'Lydia ...'</p> <p>'I'm going to be late, Silas, I'm on theatre duty tonight.'</p> <p>He sat on the bed, watching her change her clothes. The white, staff nurse's uniform soon gave her a new and formidable freshness. She cursed her own distraction, as her pantyhose caught in the skirt's zipper. She hitched the skirt up, freed the hose and smoothed them upwards, over her thighs and buttocks. Her legs acquired a contained kind of sensuality. Then she pulled down the skirt, pinned on the goldembossed nameplate that had once been such a source of pride to her mother, grabbed her bag and the car keys. She said a hasty 'Bye', and left Silas sitting on the bed. He heard the door close, the customary quiet click of the latch. She was always quiet, so precise in everything she did. He heard the car start, the engine rev, heard it settle down to an idle.</p> <p>He went to the kitchen and opened a beer, slowly poured it into a tall glass that he tilted towards the bottle, until it was nearly full. He held the glass upright, continuing to pour, slowly, until a delicate head of foam gathered at the mouth without spilling over. But the pleasure he felt at pouring his beer so artfully quickly disappeared.</p> <p>Overcome by a sudden, bloated feeling, he abandoned the glass of beer and the empty bottle on the long, austere dining-room table and sat down in the old easy chair that he had salvaged from his mother's house in Doornfontein, when the place was declared 'white' and the family was evicted. That had been his mother's last nomadic stop in her journey from suburb to suburb, singled out for pursuit, she believed, by the grey-suited men who implemented the apartheid laws. In his eyes, taking that chair from the ruins of his mother's home and life was the only sentimental thing he had ever done. Now it creaked under his weight, deepening the silence in the house.</p> <p>The hot day and all the beer he had drunk made him feel drowsy. He raised his head and looked towards the sun, sinking behind the tall buildings that marked the boundary of Berea. He remembered the sun shining in through the high, square window of his and Lydia's first home in Noordgesig, a township on the edge of Soweto, recalled the small-house quietude of the day winding down, the noises in the street. There were many such half-drunken Sundays when Lydia refused to make love to him and he fell asleep, waking up when the sun in the square window gave way to cold shards of moonlight and she told him it was time for dinner. And then, one day, the moon was caught in the bars of a window that seemed familiar yet very different somehow, further away than even that distant township window that the architects had put in as an afterthought. Even bushies need light occasionally, they must have schemed. He heard Lydia's voice, different as well, hoarse and rich, vibrating like a singer's voice too deep to be played so loudly through a set of worn-out speakers. 'Naai her, naai her good!' another voice said, while someone laughed above the sound of an idling car engine, and then Lydia's voice was sharp, ascending into a scream, before fading into a moan so removed it seemed to come from his dreams.</p>",
  "Working motherhood getting you down? Fed up with living in a country where you're made to feel like a bit of a slacker for getting pregnant? <p>Well, don't move to Sweden. The Nordic country may have been boasting for decades about its fantastic parental pay and rights packages and its nurseries on every street corner, but according to a leading academic in the field, we have all been duped. Dr Catherine Hakim, a sociologist at the London School of Economics who specialises in women's employment and women's issues, says in a book out this week that what we have been told about the Swedish experience amounts to \"true lies\". </p> <p>What we have heard over the past few decades about life there is technically true - there is a well-developed system of family-friendly initiatives that allows women more maternity leave, better pay and more flexible working opportunities. But when you look more broadly at the whole picture, at where women fit into the wider employment map across Sweden, there are a few nasty surprises. </p> <p>What we all expect - but what is never actually said - about Sweden and countries such as Norway and Denmark is that because they have such a forward-thinking attitude to the needs of working parents, women have a much better deal, are able to work more effectively and to progress better. Wrong, wrong and wrong again, says Hakim. \"Swedish women don't have it made - they still end up paying a price in terms of their career or employment. What you find, if you look closely at the figures, is that there is a pay threshold in Nordic countries below which are 80% of all women, and above which are 80% of all men. </p> <p>\"What is more, the glass ceiling problem is larger in family-friendly Sweden than it is in the hire-and-fire-at-will US, and it has also grown as family-friendly policies have expanded. In Sweden 1.5% of senior management are women, compared with 11% in the US.\" </p> <p>And that's not all. Take another barometer of equality - the gap between men's and women's pay - and Sweden puts on another poor show. It is difficult, says Hakim, to get accurate figures, but she reckons that Swedish women are paid around 20% less than Swedish men - a similar pay difference to the one that exists in the UK. Interestingly, other EU countries with a lower pay gap don't show a correlation with better family-friendly packages: Italy has a 15% pay gap, Spain a 12% gap and Belgium and Portugal an 8% gap. None of these countries is held up as providers of great family-friendly packages - indeed, some of them, including Portugal, have systems in place that are not only a great deal less generous than that of Sweden, but also a lot less accessible. </p> <p>So, to the next pit-stop in the race to improve the lot of women in the jobs market: worker segregation. This, like equal pay and access to top jobs, has long been regarded as an essential goal in the battle: women have been over-represented for ever in certain low-status sectors of the economy, and if real change is to come about, we all want to see an evening- out of the sexes across these fields. </p> <p>Surely Sweden has something to boast about here? Not so, says Hakim: 75% of Swedish women are working in the public sector - traditionally the lower-paid, lower-qualified end of the employment market - while 75% of men are working in the racier, more demanding private sector. What has happened through the years of family-friendly policies, she says, is that private companies have reduced their number of female employees because they can't afford the cost of the generous maternity packages. </p> <p>That, of course, is exactly the argument being voiced angrily this week by employer organisations, in the midst of claims by Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt that a third Labour term would see an enhanced commitment to better parental rights (and hence, more emulation of the kinds of policies that have already been adopted in Scandinavia). Hakim, for one, can see precisely where they're coming from: as far as she's concerned, the story of Sweden over the past two decades is the story of a country whose small industries couldn't foot the bill for the ideological parental-rights packages being embraced, and who have largely taken avoiding action when it has come to employing women of childbearing age. </p> <p>All of this is starting to sound a bit like an anti-feminist rant: could Hakim be some Daily Mail cut-out trying to bat the working mothers among us down to size? Absolutely not, she insists - although she can see why, as an academic who eschewed motherhood to concentrate on her career, the knives might be out for her. She believes she is a hard-headed realist who is prepared to call a spade a spade in the midst of an argument that has been spun to smithereens over the past quarter-century. The unpalatable fact, she says, is that there are only so many hours in the day and only so many days in the week and whatever else we expect of the UK and EU the one thing their legislation cannot give us is the one thing that working mothers so desperately crave: more time. \"The bottom line is that as far as investment in a career is concerned, policies actually don't make that much difference,\" she says. \"The major investment required is one of time and effort: if you are seriously interested in a career, you don't have time for children and if you are seriously interested in bringing up more than one child, let's say, you don't have the time, effort and imagination for getting to the top of a career. </p> <p>\"The fact is that children are a 20-year project and a career is a 20- to 40-year project and there is an incompatibility there.\" Over the past eight years, Hakim has written six books and she says, \"There's no way I could have done that if I had had children.\" </p> <p>Maybe she couldn't but that is not to say that some women and a lot of men do? Hakim does not believe that her argument is inherently sexist: she believes that women are just as capable as men of rising to the top of the career pile, of earning top salaries and boasting demanding and high-status jobs. It's not that we can't do it, she says, so much as that once we've got children we don't want to do it. \"Very few women who have more than one child want to play it that way, in my view. You can have one child and be a kind of nominal mother who has done it once and fulfilled that requirement, and you can concentrate on your career. But once you have two children or more what I think you are far more likely to want is work that is interesting and challenging and that fits in with the children - that allows you to work certain hours and not be bothered at all times of the day and night by a very demanding employer.\" </p> <p>Hakim believes that more men than women are work-centred rather than family-centred and that the majority of high-earning, high-status men with families have been able to offload the lion's share of the domestic work on to a partner and, probably, paid help. </p> <p>Which brings us back to Sweden, where there is more grist to Hakim's mill in the fact that take-up of paternity rights has been low, despite incentives to try to increase its use. What is more, she says, surveys show that Swedes do not want their parental package rights to be extended: what they would like, she claims, is quite simply more flexibility to organise their family life in the way they want to. </p> <p>And this, says Hakim, is at the heart of what she is saying: that in the 21st century, work patterns and child-rearing patterns are increasingly so complicated and diverse that policies that assume a homogeneous worker may do more harm than good.\" What we need,\" she says, \"is a lot more imagination. Women who have had children do not necessarily want to go back to work for a while, and they do not necessarily want to go back to the same job they had before. And a family's needs may be different from the way they are often presented - for example, I don't think fathers are necessarily that good around tiny babies, but they are often fantastic with older children - why not look at the idea of taking daddy leave when they're teenagers? </p> <p>\"We need to think a lot more broadly than we have been doing on these issues: a lot of the old thinking just doesn't work any more.\" </p> <p><b>Parental rights: How Britain and Sweden compare</b></p> <p><b> Britain: </b> New mothers get six months' paid leave and the option of six months further unpaid leave. The first six weeks are at 90% of pay and the next 20 at \u00a3102.80 per week. New fathers are allowed two weeks' paid leave at a maximum \u00a3102.80 a week. Under proposals unveiled by Patricia Hewitt this week - which the government says represents her views rather than concrete policy - a third Labour term could see new mothers getting their paid leave upped to 12 months, while new fathers could get their paternity pay boosted to 90% of their salaries, and the possibility of six months' unpaid leave. </p> <p><b> Sweden: </b> Parents get a maximum of 480 days' leave split between parents but neither can take more than 420 days.

  "<p>No star of the last 10 years has been such a magnet for the neuroses and prejudices of those who watch her than Paltrow. Camille Paglia, writing here, referred to her as \"vacuous, sallow, moony, rubbernecked\" and, noting that she is the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and late producer/director Bruce Paltrow, called her \"a preening, pampered princess who's been foisted on the public by a bicoastal media cabal.\" Tara Ariano and Sarah D. Bunting worked a similar, familiar theme on MSNBC, writing: \"Even before she won her Oscar, Gwyneth Paltrow was Hollywood royalty -- the child of a lovely patrician actress and a producer of interesting, critically praised TV shows. But she hasn't just lazed about, drawing on her trust fund of fame: she's made a name for herself by dating her co-stars; dressing so well that she's considered a fashion icon; talking about her trendy hobbies, from yoga to her macrobiotic diet to 'cupping'; and now for marrying a rock star, giving birth to their child, and naming her after produce. Oh, and she hasn't made a good movie since 'Shakespeare in Love.'\"</p> <p>People seem to hate Paltrow because she's got that slightly aloof patrician beauty, because her career benefited from the connections she had growing up the daughter of Blythe Danner and Bruce Paltrow, because family friend Steven Spielberg helped her get into the movies, because her dad bought her the Harry Winston necklace she wore to the Oscars, because she burst into tears accepting the award, because she married rock star Chris Martin of Coldplay, because she named their daughter Apple. And this history isn't even checkered by a broken home or a stint in rehab to console Paltrow haters, darn it.</p> <p>It's understandable that Paltrow pushes the buttons of people who didn't have the advantages she did, who think of how hard they've had to work for what they've gotten and resent how easily success has come to her. Those are very real, very strong, very persistent feelings. They're also part of the slop we have to put aside if we want to call ourselves grown-ups. Nobody should like the fact that life isn't fair -- but being shocked by it past, say, your sophomore year in college seems naive.</p> <p>It's childish to rail against the fact that people's connections help them (the exception being the current occupant of the White House). There wasn't one person I heard making fun of Paltrow for bursting into tears accepting her Oscar who didn't sound offensively inhuman. Here was a young woman overwhelmed at the tail end of an emotional roller coaster (her father and grandfather had been seriously ill). You just know that had she remained composed those same people would have accused her of being an unemotional ice princess who acted like the Oscar was her due. And when people talked about her father having bought her the Harry Winston necklace she wore to the ceremony, as if wanting it or owning it were a moral failing, it sounded like nothing so much as a childish temper tantrum.</p> <p>What may be most interesting about the Paltrow haters is this: Ask any one of them why they hate her and it's almost a sure bet that the quality of her acting will barely figure into it. Maybe they have to avoid the question because, in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, there's not a list of successful big-budget garbage for them to glom onto. Paltrow has kept largely to small- to medium-budget \"specialty\" films. The new \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" is the first thing Paltrow has done that belongs in the blockbuster league, and even it is an odd duck among blockbusters. Composed almost entirely of computer-generated effects (there are only actors and props -- no sets), \"Sky Captain,\" by first-time writer-director Kerry Conran, plays like what you'd get from a kid who shoots Super 8 movies in his backyard and has been given $70 million to do what he wants. But like every other element of the movie, the actors, including Paltrow, exist only to fulfill some iconic function and are part of an enormous, sustained conception that sits on the screen without ever coming alive.</p> <p>Like most people, I first saw Gwyneth Paltrow in Steve Kloves' film \"Flesh and Bone,\" where she played a young con artist whose specialty is sneaking into wakes and, with the aid of Vaseline, stealing the rings off the fingers of corpses. Her whole affect in the picture was so fuck-you blas\u00e9, so unabashedly nasty, that she won me over right away.</p> <p>The trouble was, that same blas\u00e9 affect defined her other work from the period. In the early '90s, just before her movie career broke, I saw her onstage as Nina in a Williamstown Theater Festival production of \"The Seagull,\" co-starring with her mother and Christopher Walken. It wasn't a good performance. Wan and resigned where Nina is tormented and lyric, Paltrow moped through the role, her flat, nasal voice finding none of the pathos or sad comedy of Chekhov's lines.</p> <p>Paltrow has sometimes put her zonked, bruised quality to startling use, as in the role of the Vegas cocktail waitress/hooker in Paul Thomas Anderson's terrific \"Hard Eight\" (still too little seen and still Anderson's best movie). But other times she just seemed dissociated from the pictures she was in, a promising actress who needed some training to refine her potential (and especially to bring some variety to her voice). The stardom that followed, to say nothing of the Oscar, stymied that.</p> <p>If Paltrow is only sometimes the actress she can be, she is also, more often than not, a delightful screen presence. Movies like \"Emma\" (in which she seemed wholly inauthentic) and last year's \"Sylvia\" (as well as perhaps the upcoming screen version of David Auburn's play \"Proof,\" which Paltrow played onstage in London) are her prestige outings. She's much more enjoyable in throwaway pictures. My colleague Stephanie Zacharek described what a fetching clotheshorse Paltrow made in the tepid \"A Perfect Murder.\" In the wrinkle-in-time romantic fantasy \"Sliding Doors,\" Paltrow got to mix charm with coolly cutting sarcasm. Playing an Englishwoman, Paltrow went believably from withering indignation to clipped vulnerability to a sort of dry coquetry, and she matched up very well with John Hannah, whose slight frame complimented hers. And Paltrow's charm lent a sweetness to last year's \"View From the Top,\" in which she played a small-town girl who dreams of becoming a stewardess. The picture was a trifle but, like Mike Nichols' \"Working Girl,\" it was about the weird intersection of blue-collar and white-collar jobs, and it didn't condescend to the people in those jobs or to their dreams. Silly comedies, though, are often treated as if they're beneath contempt. Which is certainly how Paltrow speaks of it in a recent Entertainment Weekly interview.</p> <p>That interview reveals one unattractive movie-star habit -- that of distancing yourself from your failures. \"If you go back and look at interviews,\" she says, \"you'll never, you'll maybe twice hear me saying I genuinely love a film, because I don't lie.\" Forget that sometimes telling a lie is simply a matter of being gracious to the people you work with. Paltrow's priding herself on her honesty suggests that she's not the best judge of her work because, with the exception of \"Shakespeare in Love,\" in which she deserved every bit of praise she got, her best work has been done in movies that were either critical or commercial failures or both. Maybe the acclaim for \"Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\" and \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" will prompt a reappraisal of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's \"Great Expectations,\" which was greeted as a travesty when it opened in 1997. (In a Premiere magazine profile at the time, Paltrow suggested that Cuar\u00f3n had lost control of the production.) It's a rapturous updating of the Dickens novel that has its dedicated admirers; the discerning British film critic Robin Wood has called it a model for how film adaptations can be true to the spirit of their sources while being wholly original creations. Paltrow plays Estella, the young beauty raised by her guardian Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on the male sex. Ethan Hawke is the young artist whose bloodstream Estella enters when they are just children. It's a tough role, that of a beauty whose surface radiance has no inner correspondence. As the critic Steve Vineberg put it at the time, Paltrow has to play \"the sadness of a woman with no emotions,\" and she's remarkable. The infernally beautiful young Jean Simmons was memorable as the younger Estella in David Lean's famous 1946 film of the novel. (Valerie Hobson, who played the grown Estella, is memorable too, but for all the wrong reasons -- she's a colossal comedown after Simmons.) Put it this way, Simmons is as good as Paltrow, but she isn't any better.</p> <p>It was another literary adaptation, Neil LaBute's 2002 film of A.S. Byatt's \"Possession,\" that provided Paltrow with one of her best roles. Like \"Great Expectations,\" \"Possession\" was held up as an example of how movies are hopelessly inadequate for conveying the complexity and richness of novels. In some ways, LaBute seems to understand the material better than Byatt did. He made a fleet, sharp adaptation that focused on the parallel love stories Byatt had devised. LaBute's film is a civilized entertainment entirely free of the reverence and stuffiness that clogs up too many period films. As the female, British half of a pair of academics chasing down the hidden love affair between two Victorian poets, Paltrow put both her coolness and the propriety of her self-presentation to comic, and at times melancholic, effect. What's touching about the performance is the reticence that remains in Paltrow as her icy exterior starts to melt. It's her most stylized, and stylish, performance.</p> <p>Paltrow's fine-boned beauty makes her appear almost a stylized creature at times, more a moonbeam than a sunbeam. And that may be why she has often been at her most affecting in comedies or love stories, which are stylized forms. Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut once wrote about how, because of the surrounding idealized perfection, sad moments in musicals can be especially wounding.</p> <p>That's the principle at work in the Farrelly brothers' \"Shallow Hal,\" which features Paltrow's most affecting performance -- certainly her sunniest and most relaxed. The movie's message is childishly simple -- beauty is only skin deep. But conviction and emotion can make even the most banal concepts feel rich, and \"Shallow Hal\" is one of the loveliest, most affecting, and most emotionally satisfying of American film comedies. Paltrow plays Rosemary, a girl whose obesity keeps people from seeing what a beautiful person she is -- except for Jack Black's Hal, who is under a spell that lets him see only a person's inner beauty. So Hal sees Rosemary as a slim, beautiful girl; the \"real\" Rosemary is Paltrow in a fat suit.</p> <p>\"Shallow Hal\" provoked exactly the kind of outrage you'd expect. In Slate, David Edelstein said of Paltrow's performance and her detractors, \"she takes many more chances here, and she won't get an Oscar -- just grief from liberals and organizations that claim to speak for the overweight.\" Some women claimed that the movie was saying it was OK to love a fat girl as long as she was really Gwyneth Paltrow. The trouble is that nothing in the movie supports that reading. In the Farrellys' conception, inner beauty cuts both ways. The real proof of what the movie is saying comes when Jack's spell is lifted. From then on, the only Rosemary anyone sees is Rosemary as she actually appears, and that's the woman Jack has to learn to love -- not the svelte blond beauty his spell allowed him to see. That girl is, quite literally, a fantasy creature.</p> <p>As Rosemary, Paltrow expresses emotion that has the force of the elemental. The hurt on her face when Jack, under his spell, chides her, saying that she must have to fend off the guys, is exceeded only by the hurt she expresses when she realizes he has (momentarily, in the movie's scheme) rejected her because of who she really is. Paltrow lets us see a young woman learning to be comfortable with who she really is and then, cruelly, made to feel a freak inside her body. There's no distance between what Rosemary feels and what Paltrow makes us feel.</p> <p>\"Shallow Hal\" and last year's underrated \"Stuck on You\" reveal that the Farrelly brothers may be less interested in sophomoric humor than in recasting themselves as the radical humanists of American film comedy. These are deeply inclusionary movies, in which ugliness as well as beauty are only skin deep. In \"Shallow Hal,\" Paltrow is right on their wavelength. The directors had a comically irresistible idea -- to take the golden princess of American movies and put her in a fat suit. The movie erases the distance between Paltrow and the audience, not because she is pulled off her pedestal and humiliated, but because it allows us to see her wounded by emotions that most of us assume would be alien to Gwyneth Paltrow. That's another example of how the Farrellys make hash of our assumptions. Of course \"Shallow Hal\" is red meat to Paltrow haters, because it says judgments based on surfaces arebthe ugliest thing imaginable. A simple idea her most fervent detractors have yet to grasp.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Charles Taylor is a Salon staff writer.</p>",

  "Thousands of people have received letters warning they may be at increased risk of developing the incurable brain disease variant CJD as a result of medical treatment, it was announced yesterday. <p>The notification - which should have reached 3,000 to 4,000 people so far but will eventually go to 6,000 - has been triggered by the cases of two people who are thought to have been infected with vCJD from a blood transfusion. One has since died.</p> <p>Those most at risk are people with haemophilia, which prevents blood from clotting properly. There are more than 15,000 people in the UK with haemophilia and related disorders, but only those treated with blood plasma products made in the UK between 1980 and 2001 are considered at risk. Plasma products are now sourced in the US.</p> <p>Experts know of nine blood donors who later developed vCJD, for which there is no test before symptoms appear. Those donors gave 23 donations and their blood was incorporated into 200 batches of plasma products.</p> <p>After a detailed risk assessment, the government has decided to notify 4,000 people who may have received contaminated plasma products. A further 2,000 others will be sent background information in case they have received blood products from donors yet to be identified as infected with vCJD. A further 50 suffering from primary immunodeficiency, and a few who have been treated with large quantities of plasma for other reasons, will also be notified that they are at increased risk.</p> <p>Yesterday the government's chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, said the approach was \"highly precautionary\" and emphasised that those involved might be at only \"a small increased risk\" of developing the disease over people who ate beef during the 80s and 90s.</p> <p>\"This information will enable these people and their doctors to take the necessary steps to minimise the risk of onward transmission of vCJD,\" he said.</p> <p>They will be advised to avoid giving blood or donating their tissue or organs, and asked to inform their doctor or dentist if they are to undergo any surgical procedure.</p> <p>Any instrument used on them would not be reused. In what was described as a \"belt and braces\" approach, letters have also gone to their GPs and specialists, and hospital notes will be called in for annotating.</p> <p>Nobody has yet developed vCJD from receiving plasma products - only from a whole blood transfusion. People who received whole blood from someone who went on to develop the disease were told about it earlier this year. Experts think the processes the blood goes through as it is turned into plasma products may greatly reduce the risk of transmission.</p> <p>Even so, the letters will cause further anxiety for those people who have already suffered through infected blood transfusions. About 4,800 haemophilia patients were infected with hepatitis C through contaminated blood in the 70s and 80s and 1,200 of them were co-infected with HIV. Up to 1,000 have died.</p> <p>One patient who received his letter yesterday called for an independent inquiry into the contamination of the UK blood supply.</p>",
  "<p>The government came under growing pressure yesterday to take away parents' legal authority to smack their children, after the parliamentary committee on human rights said the practice contravened UN conventions. </p> <p>MPs and peers said the law allowing parents to justify physi cal punishment as \"reasonable chastisement\" was incompatible with the UN convention on rights of the child and other international agreements.</p> <p>Their conclusion will make it harder for ministers to refuse Labour MPs a free vote on the issue at the report stage of the children bill, due in late October or early November.</p> <p>Anti-smacking campaigners believe they will win a major ity unless the government imposes the whip against them.</p> <p>In July ministers accepted a compromise in the Lords which would have allowed parents to administer a light smack, but make them liable to imprisonment if they caused bodily harm to their child. Children's charities said the distinction was legally untenable and called for common assault on children to be treated in the same way as it is for adults.</p> <p>The parliamentary committee said the amendment might for the time being satisfy the European convention on human rights , but \"there is a risk that it will in future be held to be incompatible\".</p> <p>In addition, the continuing availability of the defence of reasonable chastisement was \"incompatible with the UK's obligations under the UN convention on the rights of the child, and under other international agreements\".</p> <p>Peter Newell, coordinator of the Children Are Unbeatable! Alliance, an umbrella group of 350 anti-smacking organisations, said: \"The human rights pressure for full abolition of so-called reasonable chastisement is now overwhelming and our politicians must act. This report gives parliament the green light to amend the children bill to recognise children's equal right to protection from assault. Children are people, albeit smaller and more fragile, with human rights. They are entitled to physical integrity and human dignity, just like the rest of us.\"</p> <p>Kevin McNamara, a Labour member of the parliamentary committee, said: \"Only full abolition of the archaic 'reasonable chastisement' defence will satisfy our human rights obligations to children under UN and other treaties. Parliament should grasp the opportunity provided by the children bill to give children equal legal protection from assault. This is a fundamental human rights principle which we cannot ignore.\"</p> <p>David Hinchliffe, Labour chairman of the Commons health committee, who is leading the anti-smacking rebellion, said: \"Support for equal protection for children is strong in parliament and growing all the time. This important report, setting out that this is an issue of human rights principle, will add to the mounting pressure on ministers to allow a free conscience vote.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Yusuf Islam. Photograph: PA</strong></p> <p>Poor old <a href=\"http://www.yusufislam.org.uk/index.shtml\">Yusuf Islam</a>. The Artist Formerly Known as <a href=\"http://www.majicat.com/ \">Cat Stevens</a> has long been at pains to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,553587,00.html\">distance himself</a> from Islamist violence, but that didn't stop American security chiefs <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1310206,00.html\">blocking his entry</a> to the Land of the Free last night for reasons of \"national security\".</p> <p>Cat/Yusuf is widely regarded to be moderate in his views, and his efforts at bridge-building have earned the respect of no less a threat to national security than Tony Blair.

Perhaps it's Stevens' recent forays back into pop music that prompted the US to slam the door shut. For example, check out the lyrics to <a href=\"http://www.yusufislam.org.uk/audio/peacetrain.shtml\">Peace Train</a>: \"Oh I've been smiling lately / Thinking about the world as one / And I believe it could be, /Some day it's going to come.\" </p> <p>On the face of it, a hippy-drippy rewrite of Imagine.

  "<p>It's a dark night in Manchester. Two men sit in a blacked-out car, ski masks on and caps down. \"You ready to go handle these peeps?\" asks the driver before accelerating off down the wet streets. Rounding a corner, they spot their target. A group of men, hoods up, look round in alarm at the screech of tyres as the car pulls alongside. \"Yo! Guess who?\" The clap, clap, clap of gunshots ring out as the car speeds away. A man lies bleeding on the ground. </p> <p>Welcome to Lickin' Shot, a new comic book written for members of black gangs, which tells the story of a young man lured into a life of drug dealing through the promise of fame, money and girls. The story, with its drive-by shootings and tales of empty praise and glory before the hero's final rejection of his life of crime, has been played out in plenty of ghetto films. But it's not often that life as a member of a black gang in the UK is so vividly portrayed - and by people who have grown up with gangs, drug dealing and violence as an everyday reality. </p> <p>Produced by Lifeline, the drugs and alcohol charity that has gained a notoriety of its own through its controversial publications, Lickin' Shot has been devised, written and illustrated by former members of black gangs from Manchester's infamous Moss Side area. Lickin' Shot, street slang for dealing drugs, explores issues such as peer pressure, status anxiety and the codes of loyalty and respect between gang members that go hand-in-hand with the desire for the money and glamour that draw so many young men into black gang culture. </p> <p>It took the writers, who go by their street names of Swayzie, Cautious, and Bigboy Novadan, just over a year to pull the project together. \"We were sceptical at first,\" admits Novadan. \"So many people misrepresent young black men and we thought Lifeline wanted to do another 'Don't do drugs, kids' project that would be a waste of our time. But when we realised that we had control of what was going to be said, and we saw the drawings, we knew we could do something meaningful.\" </p> <p>The book does not take a moral stance on gang culture, selling drugs or violence. Instead, it tries to connect with young men attracted to gang membership by exploring some of the long-term implications of this way of life and explaining some of the decisions that youngsters will be faced with. </p> <p>\"Just because you're in a gang it doesn't mean you're a mean-hearted callous killer,\" says Cautious. \"Everybody has a conscience and everybody knows what's right and what's wrong. A lot of these boys don't think, 'I've gotta get into a gang so I can get a gun or rob people.' Most of the time it's about fitting in and wanting to be accepted and respected, and then you get sucked in. We've lived through it and know what happens to you, and we want to show people what they're getting themselves into. Then it's up to them.\" </p> <p>The ex-gang members were initially approached with the idea by David Williams, a community worker in Manchester, who had worked with Lifeline on the original idea for Lickin' Shot. \"I don't think young black men are being talked to in the way they should be,\" says Williams. \"Yes, there are channels out there designed to get through to young black communities, but I don't think they're going deep enough into people's cultural backgrounds and identities. I saw the potential this project had to do this.\" </p> <p>Inevitably, the end result is semi-autobiographical. Like Cautious, Swayzie and Novadan, the book's hero, Jamal, moves with his single mother from London to Manchester, where he gets involved with the wrong people and ends up with his life in danger. Initially, the trio wanted Jamal to end up as a rap star after leaving the gang, but eventually made him learn his trade as a plumber. \"What we wanted to show is that, at the end of the day, these people aren't your friends,\" Swayzie says. \"Living a legit and clean lifestyle may be difficult, and you may get flack for it, but your life is better in the long run.\" </p> <p>Lifeline has for several years been working on the idea of a project for young black gang members. Its publication department, which has a back catalogue of more than 150 titles, was launched in 1990 after the success of the 1987 Smack in the Eye adult comic, which used humour as a way of getting health and safety information to drug users. It now produces information booklets and leaflets for a wide audience, including recreational drug users, young offenders, parents and teachers. </p> <p>\"People are naive if they think that telling people not to do something is going to work,\" says Michael Linnell, Lifeline's director of communications. \"With Lickin' Shot, we're not denying that there are attractions to the gang lifestyle. It's all about what's important to a particular group. It would be useless showing the main character developing a blinding remorse about selling drugs if they're actually more bothered about their mothers being disappointed in them. All our work is about trusting people to tell their own story and not imposing our messages on them.\" </p> <p>But producing publications with titles such as Going in the Groin and Better Injecting has repercussions. The charity has weathered attacks from the Home Office and the tabloid media, who accuse Lifeline of pushing pro-drugs propaganda and glamorising and condoning drug use. In 2002, the charity was threatened with prosecution by Greater Manchester police after one of its publications included a \"safe kit\" of drugs paraphernalia, such as needles, syringes and gauze. </p> <p>But Lifeline is undeterred. Its publications are popular with its target readerships and are in high demand from buyers that include drugs agencies, schools, young offender institutes and local health authorities. And because the division is self-funded, Lifeline intends to continue producing publications as it sees fit. </p> <p>\"Will we get flack for tackling gang culture this way? I don't know and, quite frankly, I don't care,\" Linnell says. \"We launched this publication because nobody was speaking about the growing epidemic of young black men getting involved in crime and selling but not using hard drugs. We don't seek controversy, but on the other hand we're not prepared to compromise what we think is right just because some sections of the government or media don't like what we're doing. The reaction we've had from our target audience has been 100% positive, and that's all we care about.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Download Lickin' Shot and a single by those involved in the project, called Live Legit, at <a href=\"http://www.lifelinepublications.org\">www.lifelinepublications.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Parents will have to pay up to \u00a3400 a year for their kids to get to school as part of new laws to cut back on the congestion caused by the daily school run, it was announced today.</p> <p>The government confirmed that it is introducing a new schools transport bill at the earliest opportunity - possibly before the end of the year - that will include plans to allow for some means-tested charging to help fund more school buses and safe cycle routes.</p> <p>Some local authorities will also be able to stagger the starting times for schools in a bid to cut down on the congestion caused by parents driving their children to school. Twice as many children are driven to school now than 20 years ago - around 40% of primary pupils and 20% of secondary pupils.</p> <p>Parents will be charged up to \u00a31 - the equivalent of a normal bus fare - for each trip on a school bus, these are currently free for children living more than three miles away, or two miles for under-eights. With around 200 school days in a year the total annual bill could amount to as much as \u00a3400 a child.</p> <p>However, the government said that any child on free school meals, or who had a disability that made transport necessary would be exempt. </p> <p>Steven Twigg, the schools minister, said that the bill would cut down on traffic and start to improve children's health. \"We want to encourage local education authorities to make walking, cycling and bus travel safe, green, healthy options for more schools and their pupils,\" he said. </p> <p>And he offered parents an assurance saying: \"The present system is unfair because it is based on the distance pupils live from school and not parents' ability to pay. There is no agenda to remove free travel from any particular group, it would be entirely at a local education authority's discretion, and there would be safeguards to ensure that those on low incomes are not charged.\"</p> <p>The bill will legislate for around 20 authorities to come up with tailored programmes to tackle the problem of the school run. Each authority will be given \u00a3200,000 to set up their new schemes. Schemes will include: plans to bring in more high quality school buses catering for more pupils, with features such as CCTV and well-trained drivers; \"walking buses\" where pupils are collected from an agreed location, and then walk together to school escorted in safe groups by volunteers; safe cycle routes to schools; changing starting times so that schools in the same area stagger their starting times to reduce the number of cars on the road at any one time. </p> <p>David Jamieson, the transport minister, said: \"With almost one in five cars on urban roads on the school run at 8.50 each morning, it's time to try out different approaches to manage our road network more efficiently, help tackle congestion and provide children and parents with healthy and safe alternatives to the car.\" </p> <p>However, Chris Keates, acting general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, warned that any reform needed detailed consultation. Adding: \"For example, staggering school opening hours to ease traffic jams could cause havoc for parents who have to drop off their children at different schools on the way to work or for teachers and their childcare arrangements. </p> <p>\"While it may be a healthy option to encourage children to walk to school, the government must consider, however, the possible consequences of this policy on rising levels of truancy. Adult-supervised walking buses could be one means of ensuring children arrive safely at school.\" </p> <p>It will be the first legislation on school transport in 60 years and follows many of the recommendations of the commons education select committee report on school transport made in the summer.</p>",
  "Immigration officials have arrested the suspected ringleader of a gang behind what they believe was the UK's biggest sham marriage racket, it emerged today. <p>Wedding ceremonies at Wandsworth register office, south-west London, were this weekend interrupted by immigration officers, leading to the arrest of the suspected ringleader and a couple taking part in a wedding. </p> <p>The gang is believed to have arranged up to 300 ceremonies, charging would-be husbands \u00a310,000 to find a bride who could enable them to stay in the UK.</p> <p>\"We can confirm that, following reports from intelligence sources, the immigration service disrupted a number of weddings at a register office in south-west London this weekend,\" a Home Office spokesman said.</p> <p>\"As a result of this enforcement action, a man believed to have been involved in the facilitation of numerous sham marriages in the UK was arrested by the immigration service at an address in east London on Saturday.</p> <p>\"Subsequent action in London and the surrounding area on Sunday and Monday led to the arrest of a further four individuals in connection with taking part in, or the facilitation of, suspect marriages. Inquiries are ongoing and we cannot comment further at this stage,\" the spokesman added.</p> <p>The scam is understood to have involved flying women from the Netherlands - who claimed to be working in the UK - into Britain to marry west African men. The women were paid between \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,000 to take part in the marriages. </p> <p>Foreign nationals who are married to EU citizens working in the UK are currently entitled to remain here without showing an intention to live together.</p> <p>Immigration officials became suspicious after noticing a pattern of women flying on single airline tickets from the Netherlands. They initially believed the women were drugs mules, but further investigations unearthed the marriage scam.</p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, today welcomed the arrests. \"These operations are testament to the enormous effort and hard work by the immigration service to protect the UK's immigration and marriage laws from abuse by determined criminals,\" he said.</p> <p>With the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, today calling for a limit to be set on immigration, the Home Office said it remained determined to protect the UK's immigration system and marriage laws from abuse. </p> <p>A spokesman said the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004, to be implemented this week, contained new measures designed to combat suspicious marriages.</p> <p>\"The legislation will require non-European economic area foreign nationals who wish to marry to produce a certificate of approval or proof of entry clearance as a spouse or marriage tourist, and give notice of intended marriage at a designated register office,\" he said.</p> <p>The immigration service is already working alongside registrars to target sham marriages. </p> <p>Home Office officials are to explore the possibility of giving registrars the power to refuse to carry out a marriage they suspect is being carried out for the purposes of illegal immigration, or with the use of false documents.</p>",
  "People today are more cynical about politicians and politics than they have ever been before. Look at any opinion poll and you'll see that we are right down there with estate agents and journalists in the public's eyes. <p>But that is hardly surprising because too many politicians have made too many promises over the last few years which they have failed to keep. </p> <p>Take tax, for example. People have been misled on tax for over a decade. In 1992 we promised to cut taxes and then we put them up. In 1997 Labour said that they would not increase taxes at all and then they raised them 66 times - the equivalent of sixteen and a half pence on income tax.</p> <p>So many people think politicians' pledges aren't worth the paper they're written on. </p> <p>Regaining that trust will be very hard indeed - I am under no illusion about that. </p> <p>We need to start from first principles, setting out clearly what we believe in. </p> <p>We need to be honest about the challenges Britain faces. If something is true but tough, we must not shrink from saying it.</p> <p>And we need to tell the truth about exactly how much we can deliver. Politicians do not have the answer to every problem and we should stop pretending that we do. If something cannot be done, we must level with the public. </p> <p>Rigorous honesty; measured criticism; realistic alternatives - that is the way to renew people's trust in politics. </p> <p>I want people to have the freedom to get on with their lives and get on in life, safe in the knowledge that government will provide them with proper security. </p> <p>That is why I am a Conservative: freedom and security, the two timeless Conservative ambitions.</p> <p><b>The Challenges Britain Faces</b><br></p> <p>Britain today faces real challenges. </p> <p>People are paying too much tax, and they're not getting value for money. High taxes, bloated government and ever increasing regulation are undermining the long term competitiveness of the British economy. </p> <p>Crime is out of control. It's like a shadow across our country. We need more discipline and more respect. People need to know that if they commit crime they will be punished.</p> <p>The Government has tried to improve our schools. Money has been thrown at the problem, but it's been wasted on bureaucracy. One in three 11 year olds cannot write properly. What hope do they have for the future? </p> <p>Billions of pounds have been spent on the NHS, but it's been wasted on bureaucracy. There are still a million people waiting for treatment in Britain - many of them old and frail. People deserve better than that in their old age.</p> <p>And we have lost control of our asylum and immigration system. At a time when Britain faces an unprecedented terrorist threat, we appear to have little idea who is coming into or leaving our country. </p> <p><b>Action, Not Talk</b><br></p> <p>People are tired of talk. They want action - action on schools, on crime, on the NHS, on value for money for taxpayers and on immigration. </p> <p>When I was Home Secretary, crime fell by almost 20 per cent in four years. </p> <p>So I do know how to get a job done. You have to be clear about what it is you want to achieve. You have to follow through what you start. And you have to focus relentlessly on the detail.</p> <p>In the months ahead the Conservatives will set out, simply and clearly, exactly what we want to achieve and how we will get the job done. On each issue, we will be honest about the challenge we face and about what we can do to solve it. Conservatives will not make promises they cannot keep. </p> <p>Today I want to address asylum and immigration, issues I first raised in Burnley last February. </p> <p>Immigration is not an easy subject for politicians to debate. It raises strong emotions. I know. When I was Home Secretary and took action to get to grips with immigration, I was condemned by some commentators as being a traitor to my immigrant roots. They seemed to believe that British people from immigrant families could have no possible interest in wanting to see immigration controlled. </p> <p>I've lost count of the times I have been told by British people from ethnic community backgrounds that firm immigration controls are essential for good race relations.</p> <p>Doubtless I will be condemned again tomorrow. And doubtless my opponents will claim that my speech today is a \"lurch to the right\". </p> <p>But immigration and asylum are not side issues. They are a cause for concern across the world. Australia, Ireland, Denmark, America, India and Canada have all taken steps to address the problem. And it is a cause for concern right across Britain - irrespective of people's background, skin colour or religion. </p> <p>People know that Britain's immigration and asylum system has broken down. They know that it is chaotic, unfair and out of control. They want politicians to be honest about the problem. And they want clear, fair and practical action to tackle it.</p> <p><b>Benefits of Immigration </b><br></p> <p>For centuries Britain has welcomed people from around the world with open arms. We have a proud tradition of giving refuge to those fleeing persecution. And we have always offered a home to families who want to come here, work hard and make a positive contribution to our society. My father was one of them. </p> <p>Migration in both directions is part of a dynamic economy. Our industries and businesses depend upon skilled labour and expertise which can often be found abroad. Britain has benefited from immigration - both economically and culturally. We are a stronger, more successful country because of the immigrant communities that have settled here. </p> <p>Many of them came to Britain with almost nothing and had to start again from scratch. But hard work, determination and a willingness to integrate propelled them forward. They are a credit to our community. </p> <p>Britain has an enviable record of racial integration. Over the years hundreds of immigrant communities have successfully integrated into British society. They have rightly held on to their traditions and culture, while also embracing Britain's and playing their full role in our national life. </p> <p>But any system of immigration must be properly controlled. Firm but fair immigration controls are essential for good race relations, the maintenance of national security and the management of public services. Britain is a densely populated and prosperous country. There are, literally, millions of people in other, poorer, countries who would like to settle here if they could. Britain cannot take them all. So the scale of immigration is important.</p> <p><b>Immigration in Britain Today</b><br></p> <p>Sadly, Britain's immigration controls today are neither firm nor fair. They are chaotic and they are out of control.</p> <p>Consider these facts. Only one out of every five failed asylum seekers is ever removed from the United Kingdom. </p> <p>Government officials have given work permits to people when they knew that their applications were fraudulent. </p> <p>David Blunkett has said that he sees \"no obvious upper limit to legal immigration\". Net immigration to Britain has averaged 158,000 people a year for the last five years. </p> <p>According to the Government's own predictions, Britain's population will grow by 5.6 million people over the next thirty years - equivalent to five times the population of Birmingham. Immigration will account for 85 per cent of that increase. </p> <p>Population increases of this kind do have important public policy implications, which no responsible political party could - or should - ignore. Take housing, for example. The majority of immigrants settle in London and the South East, where pressures on housing are most pronounced. </p> <p>John Prescott plans to build an extra 3.8 million homes in England over the next twenty years - 700,000 of them (that is 18 per cent) are due to net immigration. </p> <p>But Prescott's projections are based on net annual immigration of 65,000 a year. Net annual immigration today is more than double that - at 158,000 a year. On that basis we will need an additional 4.85 million homes - a million more than the Government is planning for. </p> <p>As the Government's own Community Cohesion Panel argued in July, large scale population increases have an impact on the demand for public services and community relations. </p> <p>Let me quote from that the report. \"... There are\", it said \"concerns about the speed at which newcomers can be accommodated. Housing, education, health and other services all take time to expand\".</p> <p>The Panel went on to add - and I quote - \"But people also take time to adjust. The identity of the host community will be challenged and they need sufficient time to come to terms with and accommodate incoming groups, regardless of their ethnic origin. The 'pace of change' (for a variety of reasons) is simply too great in such areas at present\".</p> <p>David Blunkett may believe that there is \"no obvious upper limit to legal immigration\". I do not agree. While migration in both directions is part of a competitive and dynamic modern economy, immigration to Britain cannot continue at its present, uncontrolled levels. </p> <p><b>A New Approach</b><br></p> <p>Britain has reached a turning point. As a country we need a totally new approach to immigration and asylum. We need a system that helps genuine refugees and gives priority to those who want to come to Britain, work hard and make a positive contribution. </p> <p><b>Illegal Immigration</b><br></p> <p>We will start by cracking down hard on illegal immigration. It is quite wrong that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are living in Britain. </p> <p>Some arrive undetected. Others come here legally as students, visitors or on a work permit but stay on illegally. Many are failed asylum seekers who have not been deported. There are now over 250,000 failed asylum seekers living in Britain who have no right to be here. </p> <p>Illegal immigration can be very dangerous. It often involves a long journey, concealed in a truck with little food, water or ventilation. People die in the process. But sadly for many it seems to be a risk worth taking. </p> <p>When illegal immigrants arrive in Britain, they often end up living in very poor conditions, working in dangerous situations on very low earnings well below the minimum wage. The tragedy at Morecambe Bay earlier this year was a stark reminder of just how bad and how dangerous illegal immigrants' working conditions can be. </p> <p>Now I am happy to admit that I made mistakes in government. We all do. And one of them was to lift the checks for passengers leaving the UK for the European Union. My mistaken decision was at least limited in its effect. But Jack Straw compounded the problem by scrapping all embarkation controls in March 1998.</p> <p>If immigration officials don't check people as they come into and out of the country (as they do in America, Australia and Canada), then they can't do anything about those who fail to leave after their work permit or student visa has expired. According to a National Audit Office report into UK Visas, a tracking exercise carried out in Accra found that 37 per cent of a sample of students issued with a visa could not subsequently be traced. </p> <p>A Conservative Government would re-introduce embarkation controls, as the first step in a package of measures to clamp down on illegal immigration. And we will take tough action against companies who employ people illegally. In the last three years there have been just 17 prosecutions and six convictions for employing illegal immigrants. After the tragedy of Morecambe Bay this should be a priority.</p> <p><b>Legal Immigration</b><br></p> <p>We will also take firm but reasonable action to bring legal forms of immigration under control. </p> <p>Without any consultation whatsoever, Labour have presided over a massive increase in immigration. It has more than doubled since they came to power.</p> <p>Labour's justification for this unprecedented increase - in as much as they have given one - has been largely economic. </p> <p><b>The Economics of Immigration</b><br></p> <p>As I have already said, of course economies benefit from immigration. But it is all a question of scale. </p> <p>Tony Blair argues that Britain's economic growth rate \"would be some 0.5 per cent lower over the next two years if net immigration were to cease\". </p> <p>The actual figure is 0.4 per cent . But what the Prime Minister failed to mention was that because the population will have increased by a quarter of a per cent in that time, the benefit per head is negligible. </p> <p>In the United States a 1997 study by the National Research Council found that immigration added just a tenth of one per cent to income per head each year. </p> <p>In any case, the pool of labour available to British employers has increased dramatically because of EU enlargement. The ten new members of the EU have a combined population of roughly 70 million. The Irish Government has recognised this fact - drastically reducing the number of work permits issued to people from outside the EU. </p> <p>Others have argued that we need immigration to fill the 500,000 job vacancies here in Britain. But there are currently 1.46 million people unemployed in our country today and over two million people who are economically inactive - people the Government wishes to move from welfare to work. </p> <p>The truth is that the best way to increase our national income is to boost productivity and competitiveness - just as they have done in America. But thanks to increasing the increasing burden of regulation and taxation, Britain's productivity growth rate has fallen by a third since Labour came to office. And we have fallen from fourth to fifteenth in the international competitiveness league table - a drop of 11 places. </p> <p>Large scale increases in immigration are not going to solve Britain's productivity problems. But if left unchecked and uncontrolled it will place growing demands on our public services and on housing - demands which we may not be able to meet. It also risks undermining community relations in the UK. To quote again from the Government's Community Cohesion Panel:</p> <p>\"We believe that inward immigration does create tensions and that these do not necessarily revolve around race. It is easier for more affluent communities to be tolerant towards newcomers as they do not perceive them to be a threat ... By contrast, many disadvantaged communities will perceive that newcomers are in competition for scarce resources and public services, such as housing and school places. The pressure on resources in those areas is often intense and local services are often insufficient to meet the needs of the existing community, let alone newcomers. These fears cannot be disregarded\".</p> <p><b>An Annual Limit to Immigration </b><br></p> <p>I believe that each year Parliament should set a maximum limit on the number of people coming to Britain, just as they do in Australia. That limit should be determined by Britain's economic needs, the demands of family reunion and our moral obligation to give refuge to those fleeing persecution. </p> <p>And within each category of immigration we need root and branch reform to ensure not just that Parliament's limit can be met, but also to create a fairer system, which is less open to abuse. That will enable us to make a substantial reduction in the number of people coming into the UK.</p> <p><b>Work Permits </b><br></p> <p>Labour have quadrupled the number of work permits issued each year from 40,000 to 175,000. The work permit system has become a major source of immigration. Once here, permit holders are usually able to stay indefinitely. After four years permit holders can apply for settlement: a significant number do and 95 per cent of applications are granted.</p> <p>What is more the administration of the work permits system is a shambles - as James Cameron, the British Consul in Bucharest revealed earlier this year. Officials are working to a \"target\" - yet another government target - of deciding 90 per cent of all applications within 24 hours. Serious checks are impossible in that timescale. </p> <p>Conservatives will restore strict control over work permits. We will introduce a points-based system on the Australian model for the evaluation of applications. And we will reverse the assumption that a work permit will, almost automatically, lead to long term settlement.</p> <p><b>Asylum</b><br> </p> <p>The asylum system is another area of chaos. Many of those claiming asylum are not genuine refugees. The Home Office concedes that up to three-quarters of the people seeking asylum in Europe do not meet the criteria of full refugees. In Britain, only two in 10 applicants are granted asylum, while another two in 10 are granted permission to stay (\"leave to remain\" or \"humanitarian protection\"). </p> <p>Only one in five failed asylum seekers are deported. Failing to deport rejected asylum applicants encourages more people to claim asylum falsely. People who are not genuine asylum seekers know that even if their claim is rejected, they are overwhelmingly likely to be able to stay in the UK. </p> <p>Claiming asylum is being used as a means of getting round Britain's immigration controls. Peter Gilroy, Strategic Director of Social Services for Kent County Council (and the man responsible for the social services needs of asylum seekers entering through Dover, the busiest port of entry in the UK) has estimated that about 50 per cent of asylum seekers are \"in the category of coming here because they are trying to seek work and to make a better life for themselves\" </p> <p> To get here most asylum seekers must undertake a long, dangerous and expensive journey, often at the hands of people smugglers. Genuine refugees who cannot afford the cost - or are not strong enough to make that journey - cannot apply. </p> <p>The current system is helping to sustain an international people smuggling network. It is estimated that \"... a large proportion of asylum seekers arrive in the UK as the result of illegal people smuggling operations conducted by criminal gangs\". These criminal gangs charge would be asylum seekers thousands of pounds to bring them to Britain. </p> <p>The gangs' often cynical disregard for the welfare of their human cargo was brought into stark relief when the bodies of 58 Chinese immigrants were found in the back of a sealed container in a lorry at Dover in June 2000. They had all suffocated. It latter transpired that each of those on board had paid tens of thousands of dollars to Chinese smuggling gangs known as \"snakeheads\" to get to the UK. They had travelled from China through Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, France, Holland and Belgium on their way to Britain. </p> <p>A Conservative government will tackle these problems at their roots. We will pull out of the 1951 Refugee Convention, as is our right, by giving twelve month's notice to the Secretary General. </p> <p>The Convention is now thoroughly outdated. It was agreed during the Cold War when a relatively few number of people were able to escape from behind the Iron Curtain. Its authors could not have imagined that it would come to be exploited by tens of thousands of people every year. We will also enter reservations against the relevant parts of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p> <p>We will replace the Convention with British legislation, which will allow cases to be decided more swiftly. Genuine refugees will be welcomed, but those who are not will be swiftly removed. This will immediately deter people from falsely claiming asylum in Britain - significantly reducing the numbers.</p> <p>In the longer term I also want to end the current situation where people can only claim asylum if they enter Britain illegally or by deception. This is illogical and immoral. </p> <p><b>Integration</b><br></p> <p>Integration is a key part of any successful immigration policy. A common language is the most obvious binding element in any society. Without it, it is much harder for people to be active members of the community.</p> <p> It's important that people who make their home here learn the language of our nation. Of course people may choose to carry on speaking their family tongue at home - that must be a matter for them. But they do need to learn English properly too. </p> <p>David Davis and Tim Collins will soon announce a package of measures to help immigrants learn English. </p> <p><b>Conclusion</b><br></p> <p>Everything I have I owe to this country. My family came here with very little and made a life for themselves. I want others to benefit from the opportunities I had. Immigration is good for Britain - we are a stronger and more successful country because of the immigrant communities that have settled here. </p> <p>But we cannot continue to allow unlimited immigration into the United Kingdom indefinitely. Immigration needs to be controlled and it needs to be fair. </p> <p>Parliament needs to set an annual maximum limit on the number of people coming to Britain in the light of our country's needs. We need to get a grip on illegal immigration, reintroduce strict controls on work permits and take action to reduce the number of people falsely claiming asylum in this country. That will enable us to make a substantial reduction in the number of people coming into the UK. </p> <p>There are no easy answers to the challenges we face, but the proposals I have set out today are reasonable, clear and practical. </p> <p>They will ensure that we regain control of our borders, restore public confidence and thus permit the proper integration of newcomers into our society. It will also deal with the concerns of the Government's Community Cohesion Panel and help to maintain good record on community relations. </p> <p>These proposals are based not on dogma but on reason, common sense and what has worked round the world. They will enable Britain to move forward as a confident, diverse yet united society. That is an aspiration which almost everyone shares. The measures I have outlined today are the best means of achieving it.\"</p>",
  "Michael Howard today returned to the controversial issue of asylum, promising that a future Conservative government would impose a limit on the number of migrants admitted into Britain each year and tear up the UN convention on refugees. <p>The Tory leader also proposed the introduction of an Australian-style points-based system for deciding which applicants would be entitled to enter the country, with the aim of encouraging the arrival of skilled, qualified English-speaking professionals.</p> <p>Mr Howard insisted that he wanted Britain to continue to benefit from the economic and cultural contributions made by its immigrant communities and live up to its \"proud tradition of giving refuge to those fleeing persecution\".</p> <p>He cited his parents' own experience as refugees from fascism in the 1930s to prove his good intentions when it comes to the issues of asylum and immigration.</p> <p>\"Everything I have I owe to this country,\" he said. \"My family came here with very little and made a life for themselves.</p> <p>\"I want others to benefit from the opportunities I had. Immigration is good for Britain - we are a stronger and more successful country because of the immigrant communities that have settled here.\"</p> <p>Refugee groups, however, fear that his plans for an annual quota on immigrants would close the door on sudden influxes of asylum seekers fleeing the outbreak of war or repression.</p> <p>Habib Rahman of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: \"We are utterly shocked to hear that the Conservative party seems prepared to ditch Britain's long-standing humanitarian commitment to the [UN] convention.\"</p> <p>While the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said that Mr Howard's plans \"fly against the principle of welcoming people fleeing persecution\". </p> <p>\"Setting arbitrary quotas on the numbers of refugees would seriously jeopardise our international obligations,\" he warned.</p> <p>Labour's minister for citizenship, Des Browne, meanwhile, criticised Mr Howard's record on asylum when he was home secretary, saying that \"after four years in the job, it took 20 months just for an initial decision for an asylum seeker\".</p> <p>In his speech, Mr Howard condemned the home secretary, David Blunkett's recent comment that he did not see an \"obvious upper limit to legal immigration\".</p> <p>\"We cannot continue to allow unlimited immigration into the United Kingdom indefinitely. Immigration needs to be controlled and it needs to be fair,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Parliament needs to set an annual maximum limit on the number of people coming to Britain in the light of our country's needs.\" </p> <p>He described the UN's 1951 refugee convention as \"thoroughly outdated\" as it was \"agreed during the cold war when a relatively few number of people were able to escape from behind the Iron Curtain\". </p> <p>\"Its authors could not have imagined that it would come to be exploited by tens of thousands of people every year. </p> <p>He added: \"We will replace the convention with British legislation, which will allow cases to be decided more swiftly. Genuine refugees will be welcomed, but those who are not will be swiftly removed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Imagine the situation. You have a friend, let's call him Rustum. He's coming to Britain to visit and do a bit of surfing while he's here (the surfing's rubbish in Uzbekistan, on account of it being landlocked). He's arriving at Birmingham international airport on flight HY211 from Tashkent, and you are going to meet him. </p> <p>Trouble is, you are running a little late. You need to know if the flight is on time. If it is also late, then you'll have time to drive; otherwise you'll take the train. So you'll need to check on the roads and the trains, too. And if you do end up travelling by rail, it would be interesting to have some appropriate reading matter - a quick guide to tilting trains, perhaps, something like that. That would certainly interest Rustum, as Pendolinos haven't reached Uzbekistan yet. Oh, and it would be nice to take a little present for him. The new Green Day album perhaps? But is it any good? </p> <p>Once Rustum's here, you're planning on heading straight to the beach to catch some waves. Should you go to the Gower peninsula, or down to Newquay? Obviously you're going to have to check surf conditions. And it might be nice to give blood somewhere along the way, if there's a place to do it. Then, in the evening you're planning a little surprise - you're going to cook Rustum's two favourite dishes: Suzette Style Crepes, and Chargrilled Wood Blewits. But can you remember the recipe? God, this is going to be one hectic day ... </p> <p>Don't worry, help is on hand, and has been for 30 years. It's called Ceefax and it can be of assistance with all of the above (see pages 125, 429, 431, 432, 449, 465, 531, 561). And you thought it was just for the news, sports results, and share prices. You probably shouldn't bother with Green Day, incidentally (\"an album to dip into rather than devour\" says Nigel Packer on page 531). And surfing-wise? At the time of writing, both Gower and Newquay look pretty hairy, with 5-6ft waves and stormy conditions. You should almost certainly check in with Simon Alexander, aka \"Micky 3 Fins\", who is on hand for some expert advice. </p> <p>Ceefax's official birthday is tomorrow, the same day as Cherie Blair's. I don't know if she was an accident, but Ceefax was. Thirty years ago, BBC engineers were looking at ways of providing subtitles for the deaf when they discovered that a normal television picture of 625 lines had spare capacity that could be used to transmit words and numbers. And so Ceefax - literally, \"see facts\" - was born. Back then it had 30 pages; now it's around 1,000. Oracle, ITV's service, was also launched the same year, then closed down in 1992 when the ITV/Channel 4 franchise was awarded to Teletext Ltd. (It's slightly confusing that teletext is also the generic term for text on the telly.) </p> <p>For most of its 30-year existence, Ceefax has rarely ventured into the foreground of the nation's consciousness. Its pages have spun around quietly and invisibly, a world to dip into occasionally for football news (page 302), what's on telly now and next (606), or the news headlines (101). </p> <p>There have been a few occasions when it has made a bit of a noise, sometimes even appearing in the news itself. Gary Lineker once said that the best place to watch Wimbledon play football was on Ceefax, prompting Vinnie Jones to call Lineker a \"jellyfish\". Bruce Rioch learned that he no longer had a job managing Queens Park Rangers from Ceefax. And when 13-year-old Zara Hoddle wanted to tell the world that she thought her dad, the England manager, was being bullied by the country, it was to Ceefax that she sent her fax. </p> <p>Not that Zara's fax was Ceefax's only scoop. Guess who was first with the story that Travis nearly split after their drummer's near-fatal accident. This exclusive was achieved when a Ceefax reporter found himself sitting next to singer Fran Healey at a football match, and they got chatting. For breaking stories, go to Ceefax first. See the facts. </p> <p>Surely though, in the age of the internet, Ceefax is no longer relevant? When you've got an information superhighway, why would anyone take the potholed country lane? Because there's something charming about the country lane, that's why. Mention Ceefax to anyone and, chances are, they'll have a guilty secret - it could be that they read the record reviews, that they have a favourite page they know the number of (606 I bet, 555 or 302). Or they may even know a short cut: the fact that the red but ton moves it on to the next page, for example. You just need to look at the birthday tributes (pages 187-198) to see that this, an irritating and outdated computer system, has somehow, wormed its way into the country's affections. John Major is a fan, Steve Davis says it's been a constant throughout his life (why is that not surprising?). When Avril Lavigne checks into a hotel room in this country, she is reported to demand two things: Bovril and Ceefax. </p> <p>Paul Brannan, the current editor of Ceefax, insists that it still has a role to play. \"It's cheap, it's quick and on demand,\" he says. \"It's convenient and it's very easy to operate.\" He points out that Ceefax still averages 20 million users a week. </p> <p>I was expecting to find Ceefax housed in a forgotten office at the end of a distant corridor at Broadcasting House, staffed by old men with cobwebs in their hair. But it's now integrated with BBC news online and looks, almost disappointingly, like any other modern newsroom. The people there are young and busy, they don't work exclusively for one thing or the other, and subeditors send versions of stories to the website and the new digital text service, as well as to Ceefax. </p> <p>But the Ceefax system is far from young and busy. The text itself is very basic: every letter takes up the same amount of space - so a \"w\" will be squeezed in while an \"i\" will be surrounded by lots of elbowroom. For some reason it can't do open quotation marks - they come out as \" instead of \" . There are only seven colours, and any attempt at a graphic or picture is a disaster - witness the pen at the top of the Dear Ceefax page (145), or the National Blood Service graphic on page 465. </p> <p>And, of course, there's the maddening waiting. Brannan attempts to explain the spinning numbers at the top of the screen. \"Think of it like a slide carousel constantly spinning round. The page you want is one slide. When you ask for that page, the time it takes to come out depends on where in its cycle the carousel is.\" </p> <p>Brannan is very good at finding analogies to explain things to technology idiots. I want to know why there are so many empty pages. \"Imagine the hull of a ship,\" he says. \"And the pages are like barnacles. The more barnacles build up, the slower the ship goes. It's a big dilemma for me - content against speed. People get very angry when it slows right down. And also if a page gets shut down.\" </p> <p>The ship will finally be scuppered when analogue is switched off in 2012. You'll still be able to access all the same information on your television set, but Ceefax, in its current form, will no longer exist. The skilfully crafted 70-word news stories, with yellow headline, white first paragraph, and three pale blue paragraphs - they'll be something to reminisce about. Gone will be the funny blocky letters, the crappy pixelated graphics, the \"wrong\" inverted commas, the carousels and the barnacles. </p> <p>And some people aren't happy about it. There is (this isn't surprising, either) a website for teletext enthusiasts called Teletext Then and Now (<a href=\"http://teletext.mb21.co.uk\">teletext.mb21.co.uk</a>). As well as a gallery showing favourite Ceefax pages from the past, it has an irresistible button labelled \"Teletext Chat\", with the tempting subline: \"Discuss teletext with others.\" </p> <p>To anyone not familiar with the hardware and software of teletext, most of the chat might as well be in Uzbek. It's all about DEC PP11 systems, thumb-wheel switches, TTL chips and exchangable RL02s. But the people I meet on the website are not in the business; they're not bothered about TTL chips and exchangable RL02s; they're just genuine amateur teletext enthusiasts. </p> <p>Gillian Kirby from Blackburn recently graduated in linguistics, and is currently temping for a carpet company. \"I've been a teletext addict for far longer than is healthy,\" she writes. \"I have fond memories of putting the subtitles on as a kid, turning the sound down and imagining what it would be like to be deaf.\" </p> <p>Later, speaking by phone, she says that the internet's not the same as teletext. \"I actually like the retroness of it. I like it when they do something about the Beatles, for example, and they do a blocky picture of the Beatles to go with it.\" Kirby thinks that ITV's service is better than the BBC's. </p> <p>But Simon Lewis, an accountant from Barkingside in Essex, is a Ceefax fan. He remembers when his dad first got a big Baird set with a wired remote control from Radio Rentals in Ilford in 1978. \"We thought it was fantastic. You could get the news, the football scores, the whole concept was fantastic,\" he says. \"I remember us all sitting round.\" Lewis can even remember the old page numbers: 120-130 for finance, 130-140 for sport; 160 was the alarm clock (now defunct, though there is a picture of the page in the gallery section of the Teletext Then and Now website, if you're interested). </p> <p>Lewis thinks it was better then than it is now, there was more background information, and also more fun. \"There were jokes,\" he remembers. \"There was someone called Joanne who always used to send in jokes.\" (Where are you now, Joanne?) Lewis has a high-speed internet connection at home, but he still goes to Ceefax first - for the news, the sports results, and share prices. He's not bothered about the graphics. </p> <p>And is it really so much slower? In a unique and highly scientific experiment, I pit Ceefax against the internet, the country lane against the superhighway (though I don't have broadband). From a standing start (ie, everything switched off, the way it is first thing in the morning), I time how long it takes to get the news headlines via both methods. Via Ceefax, it takes 14 seconds. On the internet - switching on, logging on, going to the BBC website - it takes 3 minutes, 8 seconds. In that time I could have gone to the shop to buy the paper. Or made a start on those Suzette Style Crepes.</p>",
  "The Liberal Democrats today called for a full inquiry into blood transfusions after a new government warning over vCJD, the human form of BSE. <p>The party's conference in Bournemouth backed demands for an independent probe into the contamination of blood products, in particular the use of high-risk sources of blood.</p> <p>The Lib Dems' health spokesman, Paul Burstow, also reaffirmed the party's commitment to an NHS \"free at the point of use\", following Treasury spokesman David Laws' controversial suggestion that it be replaced by a compulsory insurance scheme.</p> <p>Mr Burstow confirmed in his speech that the Lib Dems would scrap NHS targets, which \"put patients' lives at risk ... waste tax payers' money ... [and] don't work\".</p> <p>The Lib Dems call for an inquiry into transfusions comes after it was announced that patients who received blood products from donors who subsequently died from vCJD were to be warned they could be carrying the disease. </p> <p>The measures are being taken after it emerged last year that a patient had died after a transfusion from someone with the disease. </p> <p>That was thought to be the first time vCJD has been transmitted from person to person. </p> <p>The conference also heard concerns over the handling and treatment of donated blood, the failure to alert patients to known risks and the failure to take action when the risks become apparent. </p> <p>Junior Lib Dem health spokewoman Patsy Calton said all those affected by the contamination of blood products, including haemophiliacs put at risk of exposure to HIV and hepatitis C, as well as vCJD, were entitled to an inquiry. </p> <p>\"The families of the over 780 individuals who died as a result of the failing in blood products deserve answers,\" she said. </p> <p>\"To provide closure to the victims and to ensure there are no further scandals in this area, the government should hold a full independent inquiry into the failures of the past.\"</p> <p>Ms Calton's speech was followed by a debate on the Lib Dems' health policy proposals, which called for a scrapping of all targets, coupled with the abolishment of strategic health authorities and the removal of local health commissioning from \"unelected\" primary care trusts, which would be handed over to councils. </p> <p>Announcing the proposals, Mr Burstow was keen to underline the party's ongoing commitment to the NHS remaining free \"at the point of delivery\" under a Lib Dem government, paid for by general taxation, following Mr Laws' controversial chapter in the recently published Orange Book.</p> <p>Targets would be scrapped and replaced with trust in the frontline staff delivering care, Mr Burstow told the conference. National standards would be maintained through the ongoing reliance of National Service Frameworks - guidance published by the government on a range of different conditions such as coronary heart disease, diabetes and mental health. </p> <p>\"Targets miss the point, targets put patients' lives at risk, targets waste taxpayers' money, targets don't work,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Targets are all about distrusts. This Labour government doesn't trust frontline staff to deliver. We have a simple approach. Out with targets, in with trust.\"</p> <p>Performance management would continue under the healthcare commission, which would become the main check on ensuring minimum standards were maintained. League tables would also be abolished.</p> <p>In the party's most radical proposal, primary care trusts would hand over their commissioning role to councils, which would determine local health provision alongside social services.</p> <p>Strategic health authorities would also be disbanded and foundation hospitals would be redundant as the devolution of power down to the local level would exceed the current powers they enjoy.</p> <p>Free eye and dental checks would be restored, and packaged food would have \"traffic light\" labelling to help consumers understand the health implications of the foods they buy.</p>",
  "<p>The Liberal Democrats today promised to scrap the BBC board of governors in favour of a new independent regulator if they get into power, calling the present arrangement a \"huge conflict of interest\". </p> <p>At the party's conference in Brighton, members supported proposals by culture spokesman Don Foster to create a new regulatory body to oversee the BBC and the public service broadcasting function of other broadcasters. </p> <p>But a bid by some party activists to commit the party to scrapping the licence in favour of state funding was successfully seen off. </p> <p>Mr Foster argued that the Liberal Democrat proposals, which would see the creation of a new public service broadcasting regulator alongside Ofcom, would create a \"strong, independent and well and securely funded BBC\".</p> <p>\"Just one year ago the future of the BBC seemed under real threat, not least from the vindictive attacks by Alastair Campbell on the BBC's independence over its coverage of the war in Iraq,\" Mr Foster told the conference. </p> <p><strong>Overhaul would 'protect BBC from government pressure'</strong></p> <p>He argued that a radical overhaul of the corporation's regulatory structure was required to protect it from the kind of government pressure that led to the departures of chairman Gavyn Davies and director general Greg Dyke in January this year. </p> <p>\"The war led not only to regime change in Iraq but to regime change in the BBC. Many feared for the corporation's future,\" he added. </p> <p>\"But that means radical change in regulation. It can't be right that BBC governors are both flag wavers for the BBC and regulators of the BBC. That's a huge conflict of interest,\" he said.</p> <p>New BBC chairman Michael Grade has already acknowledged the need to further separate the governors from the management of the corporation, agreeing to fund a new administrative arm to support the board and planning to physically move them to a new office away from the executive. </p> <p>The governors were criticised during the row over the Iraq dossier for being too quick to support management in their row with Number 10. Mr Grade has also acknowledged the need for more specialist knowledge on the board of governors, making former ITN chief Richard Tait one of his first appointments. </p> <p><strong>Licence fee 'should be pegged to inflation'</strong></p> <p>But Mr Foster argued that such changes were not radical enough and that the BBC should be regulated by a separate body and the governors replaced by a \"board of trustees\". </p> <p>\"Together they'd create a balance between management, oversight and regulation which was all too lacking in the rows of last year,\" he said. </p> <p>He also reiterated the party's support for the licence fee as \"by far the best of what's on offer\", but said it should be pegged to inflation. The BBC should also be forced to produce more regional programming, and funding for the World Service through the Foreign Office should be retained, he said. </p> <p>The move to scrap the licence fee was led by Alan Sherwell, a party member from Aylesbury, who said it would save the taxpayer \u00a3180m in collection costs. </p> <p>But Mr Foster, who successfully urged the party to reject the amendment, warned that it would only increase government influence on the BBC and lead to cuts in funding - as had happened in Holland and Australia. </p> <p>\"In the Netherlands, a socialist government enshrined PSB funding in law only to see the law changed, funding slashed and services decimated, when the Conservatives won the next election,\" he said. </p> <p>\"In Australia and Canada services have been dramatically reduced as a result of drastic cuts in government funding.</p> <p>\"We can trust a Liberal Democrat government to protect the BBC's funding but can we trust others? Can we trust Blair's government?\" he asked. </p> <p><strong>Danger of marginalised public service broadcasting</strong></p> <p>Mr Foster also used the platform as an opportunity to fly the flag for public service broadcasting. </p> <p>\"In principle, digital switchover means more choice; in practice, we risk the cheap and the easy crowding out the good. We could have even more mindless reality TV shows which exploit those seeking their 15 minutes of fame - or is it shame? Heaven help us if we have to rely on Fox News for our information about the world,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Heaven help us if public service broadcasting becomes so marginal as to become a ghetto for worthy programmes that no one watches.

  "<p>Rumours has always harboured concerns that there was something of the sinister pantomime villain about <strong>Arsene Wenger</strong>. And now, just as all eyes were trained carefully on Sven's next move, the myopic Frenchman has snuck off stage left and <strong>held talks with Real Madrid suits</strong>. Oh yes he has! </p> <p>According to the Daily Star, Wenger, who is out of contract at Arsenal at the end of the season, is being <strong>pestered into signing a new deal at Highbury</strong>, in the hope of seeing off any interest from Real. So they won't be please to hear he had <strong>lunch with two Madrid representatives</strong> in London yesterday, and when pressed on the matter, weakly offered \"I am the manager of Arsenal,\" hoping the Starsport reporters might be daft enough to take it as a convincing denial. When that didn't work, he cried \"He's behind you!\" and fled.</p> <p>Aside from all of which, <strong>Arsenal</strong> are said to be interested in Lecce's hot young Bulgarian striker <strong>Valeri Bojinov</strong>, and will most likely part with \u00a35m for him in January.</p> <p>Meanwhile, up at Old Trafford, things have come over a little spooky. Clearly not bothered in the least by his impending court appearance, <strong>Roy Keane</strong> has dug out his \"I want to believe\" poster, cranked up a volume of Mark Snow's best, and invited <strong>Wayne Rooney</strong> for a little man-to-man chat. </p> <p>\"<strong>Trust no-one</strong>,\" whispered Keane, holding a torch under his chin. \"<strong>99% of the people you meet will want something from you</strong>.\" Which is all well and good, but Rumours is sure even Wayne knows deep down Colleen would have been long gone were it not for the \u00a360,000 appearing in his Post Office account every week.</p> <p><strong>Tottenham</strong>'s improved start to the season could be set to flounder, not just because they've got Manchester United visiting White Hart Lane on Saturday (5-3, anyone?), but because the usual <strong>queue outside the treatment room</strong> has already started to form - <strong>Erik Edman</strong>, <strong>Nourredine Naybet</strong> and <strong>Thimothee Atouba</strong> have just joined Michael Carrick, and Sean Davis. They'll be hoping they have some luck with a <strong>third bid for Nottingham Forest's Andy Reid</strong>, then, when they once again bend the ears of Forest's bean counters in January.</p> <p>Across London <strong>Fulham</strong> fully expect to have signed free-agent<strong>Youri Djorkaeff</strong> by the end of today, which won't please <strong>Everton</strong>, who were also interested in the Bolton reject.</p> <p>Talking of leaving Big Sam's fold (and we don't mean the one between chin No1 and chin No2), <strong>Michael Bridges</strong>, who only signed at the Reebok in June, is pondering a move to <strong>Sunderland</strong>.</p> <p>Managerial news now, and <strong>Gary Megson</strong> knows it will only be so long before he's called into the big office and advised to seek <strong>alternative employment</strong>, after the Baggies crashed out of the Carling Cup thanks to Colchester United.</p> <p><strong>Steve Wigley</strong> is in much the same boat at <strong>Southampton</strong> - so much so that he's booked an hourly slot in Rupert Lowe's diary, just to check.

  "<p>The Sunday Telegraph's comment editor, Mark Law, has been sacked after firing off a furious email to managing director Hugo Drayton criticising him and several other senior management figures including the paper's editor, Dominic Lawson.</p> <p>Law left today after being called into a meeting with Lawson to discuss his email, a response to an all-staff memo from Mr Drayton calling for suggestions to improve the company ahead of the arrival of new boss Murdoch MacLennan.</p> <p>The lengthy memo appeared on everyone's desk last Friday and included a reference to the achievements existing management had made in the past year and an observation that he wanted the company in the best possible shape for Mr MacLennan's arrival.</p> <p>It finished in bold type with the request for ideas to improve the environment, a request that did not go down too well on the editorial floors, according to insiders.</p> <p>\"I would welcome any suggestions from you about anything we might do to improve our environment or work processes...in any area of our business.</p> <p>\"I would especially welcome ideas for simple changes that could improve our surroundings. Please email, telephone, write or come to see me with any suggestions,\" it said.</p> <p>According to Telegraph sources, Law responded with a \"forthright\" email criticising Mr Drayton, Lawson and \"half a dozen of Hugo's colleagues\" who he said were linked to the regime of the disgraced former Telegraph owner Conrad Black.</p> <p>The Telegraph's editorial director Kim Fletcher confirmed that Law had \"left the Sunday Telegraph\" but declined to comment further.</p> <p>However, colleagues said his relationship with Lawson had been tense for some time and that the pair had had several rows in the past.</p> <p>\"Mark is a rather brilliant but also highly irascible character. He and Dominic have had a series of run-ins about all sorts of things. Dominic's not the easiest person to deal with either. But if that keeps happening and he's your comment editor it becomes impossible,\" said one insider.</p> <p>Law, who one former colleague described as \"one of the eccentrics\", has landed himself in trouble with senior management before.</p> <p>Four years ago he infuriated former Telegraph chief executive Dan Colson when he called him at 2am in his Sydney hotel room to complain about cost-cutting in the staff canteen. A few days later he received a letter from Lawson reprimanding him over the incident.</p> <p>But colleagues said Mr Drayton's letter in which he asked staff for their ideas had infuriated many staff on the daily and Sunday papers.</p> <p>\"I don't think anyone was particularly shocked by what Mark had to say,\" said one. \"It was what we were all thinking - Mark just had the courage to put it into writing.\"</p> <p>Another said: \"Many people composed stiff responses to him in their heads but the difference is they didn't send them.\" </p> <p>Another said it was inappropriate for management to be \"begging staff for ideas just minutes before they get a new boss\".</p> <p>The letter began by telling staff that they had all been through a difficult time, and went on to outline what management had achieved despite criticism that the leadership vacuum had led to inertia at the top.</p> <p>\"For several months it was made easy for outside commentators to allege that uncertainty around our future led to corporate inertia,\" Mr Drayton wrote.</p> <p>He went on to say he felt a number of things had been achieved by the management including improvements to the \"welfare of Telegraph staff\" and \"communications to staff\".</p> <p>At the end of the memo, Drayton wrote: \"The Telegraph group management and executives are fully committed to improving our newspapers, magazines and websites and ensuring the wellbeing of all our staff.\" </p> <p>Law declined to comment on his departure.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>CBS's admission that its story of George Bush's special treatment when with the Texas air national guard was deeply flawed is being seen as a key victory for the new \"blogging\" community of the internet against old media. </p> <p>This is mainly true. Although papers such as the Washington Post were on the case, the retraction would not have happened when it did but for the efforts of an army of bloggers - writers of online journals - in exposing the documents as fraudulent, including some who authoritatively questioned the authenticity of the documents almost as they were released. </p> <p>CBS was doubly at fault. It failed to appreciate the force of the thousands of voluntary fact-checkers out there on the web (let alone trying to harness their power in advance), while also failing to interview bloggers after the event as part of an ongoing story. </p> <p>Newspapers often claim superiority because their stories go through a time-established filtration plant - professional writers, skilled subeditors, revise subs and expensive lawyers. This compares with the web's more anarchic processes, where brews of unfiltered stories, some highly speculative, are put into circulation, and cream sometimes rises to the top. </p> <p>In fact, bloggers are often people very expert in their own fields who attract other experts when issues in their domain are newsworthy. Stories in old media can be fact-checked instantaneously and the journalists and their newspapers held to account. </p> <p>At present this emergent \"citizens' media\" is reactive rather than pro-active, but things could change quickly. It has already happened in South Korea, where OhmyNews, which claims 33,000 citizen reporters, is highly influential and has a philosophy that in the 21st century everyone can write news stories and share them. </p> <p>OhmyNews is not an aggregation of blogs, because stories submitted by citizens are edited by a small permanent staff. But it does give some idea of what the future might hold. One of the reasons for the explosive growth of blogs during the past few years is that they are almost childishly easy to install - requiring no knowledge of the internet - and are mainly free (blogger.com is one of the best places to start). </p> <p>In the beginning it was just words, but now photographs have been added and video-blogs (or vblogs) are starting to appear as \"bandwidth\" becomes cheaper. It is not fanciful to suppose that a blog could soon become its own television channel. </p> <p>There is no doubt that the tectonic plates of journalism are moving. There is awesome potential in the internet as a gatherer, distributor and checker of news - not least through instant delivery channels such as mobile phones. This does not mean old media will die. But it will have to adapt quickly to what has so far been an asymmetrical relationship. </p> <p>Blogs have battened off newspapers and many newspapers, including the Guardian, have launched their own blogs. But most newspapers, let alone TV stations, have not embraced the blogging revolution as an essential part of the future rather than an irritant in the background. The CBS saga may prove to be the wake-up call they needed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Victor Keegan is the editor of Guardian Online </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:vic.keegan@theguardian.com\">vic.keegan@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "At the moment when the prime minister has announced his decision to intensify the war in Iraq and when more British troops may well be sent there, the time has come for new policies to be adopted since we know, in great detail, all the key facts from very authoritative sources. <p>We know from Paul O'Neill, George Bush's first treasury secretary, that the new president took the decision to invade Iraq when he entered the White House - almost a year before the attack on the twin towers - and that no one in Washington orLondon really ever believed that Saddam Hussein was responsible for the atrocity. </p> <p>The real reason for the invasion was to topple Saddam, seize the oil and establish permanent US bases to dominate the region. And we know that Tony Blair privately shared these objectives, and used the weapons issue to persuade parliament and public. </p> <p>We also know, from the recent report of the Iraq Survey Group, that Baghdad did not possess weapons of mass destruction. Neither the president nor the prime minister has been concerned to discover that they misled their own people and the world on this question. And it has not led them to reassess their arguments for going to war. </p> <p>No serious thought was given by Washington or London as to the likely consequences of the war and what policies should be pursued after the war was won. The warnings they received that an occupation might lead to chaos were dismissed out of hand. </p> <p>Many Iraqis held in detention have been tortured and abused by the forces of those who argued that they were there to stop those very practices, introduce democracy and safeguard human rights. And no attempt has been made to count the number of Iraqis killed or injured, which reveals a complete failure of respect. </p> <p>The supposed transfer of sovereignty to an Iraqi government has now been proved to be illusory, since Ayad Allawi has about as much sovereign control as Fidel Castro has over Guant\u00e1namo bay, where the US base remains against the will of the Cuban government. </p> <p>Kofi Annan, as secretary general of the UN, has now told us that that war was illegal and contrary to the provisions of the charter - which only provides for military action in self-defence or when authorised by the security council - which must mean that those Iraqis now defending their own country are acting within the law. </p> <p>Yet, at this very moment, we are hearing threats issued against Iran for its nuclear programme, not least from Israel, which has a huge nuclear arsenal and might even repay its debt to Bush by bombing the Iranian nuclear plants, as it did to an Iraqi installation in 1981. </p> <p>All that is on the record, and we have to decide how we should respond. Some are calling for the prime minister to apologise, which would be a meaningless gesture, while others want impeachment. But whatever political impact a short debate on that might have, the House of Commons voted for the war and MPs are unlikely to go into the lobby to condemn themselves. </p> <p>The appeal to the international court to rule on the legality of the war is more substantial, because were the court to decide that it was illegal, it would deal with the issue comprehensively and might avert future acts of aggression - but it would take years. </p> <p>Moreover, this is a war that cannot be won - not least because it is being seen as a crusade against Islam. What is needed now is a vote in parliament to withdraw the troops on a fixed date - perhaps the end of this year - and for Britain to sponsor a resolution at the security council calling on the Americans to do the same, and for a genuinely independent UN intervention to help with the elections and with the task of reconstruction after all coalition forces have gone. </p> <p> Next week in Brighton the Labour party conference could and should demand such a withdrawal, asserting its right to compel a change of policy by a democratic vote. And Labour MPs should do the same when parliament meets again next month. </p> <p>This might also prove to be the best way of saving the Labour party from the folly and misjudgment of New Labour and its leader, remembering that Clem Attlee dissuaded Truman from using an atom bomb in Korea, Hugh Gaitskell passionately opposed the Suez war, and Harold Wilson refused to send troops to Vietnam. That is what we are entitled to expect from a Labour government. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Tony Benn's latest book, Free Radical, is published by Continuum; he is president of the Stop the War Coalition.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tbenn@tbenn.fsnet.co.uk\">tbenn@tbenn.fsnet.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The Islamic Bank of Britain opened the doors to its first branch, in Edgware Road, London, today. While other banks offer individual products that comply with Islamic rules, this will be the first bank in the UK that operates wholly in accordance with Islamic sharia principles. </p> <p>Under sharia law, all money must be invested in purely ethical industries, so the bank will not invest in any business involved with tobacco, alcohol or pornography, for example. Islamic law forbids the making of money with money, and giving or receiving of interest is forbidden. Similarly, money cannot be simply traded for money, Instead, profits can be made by the buying and selling of goods and services.</p> <p>From today, the bank will be offering a range of savings accounts through its London branch, and will also offer access to the accounts across the country through postal and telephone banking. </p> <p>Instead of paying interest on savings accounts, the bank will trade in investments which comply with sharia law. The profits from those investments will then be shared with savers. </p> <p>The bank will offer current accounts and loans from November this year, and mortgages, credit or charge cards and small business banking will be available next year.</p> <p>Further branches will be opened in Leicester and Birmingham in November, and there are plans to open eight more branches, plus an internet banking facility, in 2005. </p> <p>While the bank strictly complies with sharia principles, the services it provides are available to everyone.</p> <p>Michael Hanlon, managing director of the Islamic Bank of Britain, said: \"We are delighted to be opening our first branch. It marks a new era in Islamic banking in the UK and the beginning of our work to broaden our product offering and branch network. </p> <p>\"The current additional capital raising taking place will provide funds to allow us to implement these important growth plans, and we are confident that we can provide customers with a range of sharia compliant products and services. Our products will be equivalent to those available in a conventional bank and competitively priced,\" he said.</p> <p>A supervisory committee, made up of a group of Islamic scholars, will ensure that the bank adheres fully to sharia principles. The committee will approve all services, activities and investments before they go on the market. The bank will also be regulated by the Financial Services Authority and will meet with UK banking regulations.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: Bush and Annan clash, Haiti appeals for aid, Booker shortlist announced.</p> <p><b>BIGLEY TORMENT AS SECOND HOSTAGE KILLED</b></p> <p>The Tawhid and Jihad group chose a second hostage to kill last night. It announced the beheading of American Jack Hensley and, soon after, issued a threat to kill Briton Kenneth Bigley. His situation looks bleak. The Independent visits the family home in Liverpool where \"a mother, two brothers and a son could only wait, in despair and anger, for news to end their torment\".</p> <p>The Guardian reports that there may be a glimmer of hope. The Iraqi justice minister pledged to release Rihab Taha, one of two prominent female prisoners, today and said a hearing would be held to determine the fate of Huda Amash, the second. Tawhid and Jihad had demanded the release of women prisoners in return for the hostages' lives.</p> <p>But it is only a glimmer. Rory McCarthy, the paper's correspondent in Baghdad, says the group's \"demands now look more like an attempt to garner support among Iraqis appalled at the US abuses in Abu Ghraib\" while the Telegraph argues that even if Dr Taha, a biological weapons scientist known as Dr Germ, were to be released it may not influence the hostage takers \"who appear more intent on tormenting the US-led coalition than on achieving realistic goals\".</p> <p>Inevitably, there are profiles of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Tawhid and Jihad leader who is thought to carry out the executions himself - to the Mail he is \"the executioner with a knife to the west's throat\". The Jordanian-born militant has claimed a number of attacks and killings, including the murder of the American hostage Nick Berg earlier this year, and may behind the killing this week of two clerics who criticised his methods. The Telegraph calls him \"the most prominent terrorist of the internet age\" for his use of the web to plan and proselytise. The Independent says the few people who have \"met him and survived\" report a strong personality. It adds: \"A prison doctor who knew him when he was in jail in Jordan said that he could order his followers to do things 'just by moving his eyes'.\"</p> <p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, emerges as the final figure in the drama. Mr Bigley's brother Paul accused him of being a \"fibber\" whose \"sell-by date has gone\". Speaking to al-Jazeera, he said: \"The whole war was a sham. The weapons of mass destruction were a sham. It was worse than watching an American soap opera [...] I am trying to keep myself together but I am losing it.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1309959,00.html\">Second US hostage killed</a><br>* <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/story.jsp?story=564367\">Independent: 'God is merciful.

But the US president, who received only polite applause, persisted nevertheless and, the Financial Times reports, found himself clashing with Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, over the state of global peace and security. Where Mr Bush called on all nations to embrace \"liberty's century\", Mr Annan was troubled by \"civilians massacred in cold blood\". In a pointed reference to US policy, he said: \"Those that seek to bestow legitimacy must themselves embody it, and those who invoke international law must themselves submit to it.\"</p> <p>The FT's leader column argues that Mr Bush's speech, \"a series of upbeat but generic nostrums about democracy, peace and human dignity\" revealed \"the extent of the president's disengagement from the reality of a sinking Iraq [to be] alarming.

  "<p>These are exciting times to be a Liberal Democrat, announced the man in charge of drafting the party manifesto in Bournemouth yesterday. Matthew Taylor's words were hard to square with the fact that they were spoken to a hall that was barely a quarter full and that crackled with about as much excitement as the average rain-affected county cricket match. And yet Mr Taylor is right. The 10-item \"pre-manifesto\" the Lib Dems approved yesterday is an extremely solid, extremely attractive political programme, pitched squarely in the centre ground of British politics. It underlines why the traditional third party in British politics is currently in a strong position to mount a powerful challenge to the troubled traditional big two. </p> <p>As its name implies, the pre-manifesto is a sketch of the fuller programme that Charles Kennedy will put before the voters in the general election. Its longer purpose is to stake out distinctive themes that may attach themselves to the public consciousness over the months ahead. Its immediate purpose is to highlight the Lib Dem message in the week before a Hartlepool byelection that is never far from delegates' thoughts or speeches. The Iraq war, which does not appear to be a doorstep issue in Hartlepool, is just one issue among others here. The more prominent pitches are for local control in the health service, free personal care for the elderly, abolition of tuition and top-up fees, a boost to the basic pension for over-75s and the replacement of the council tax with local income tax. Perhaps it is the case, as the Labour minister (and former Liberal) Peter Hain argued in these pages yesterday, that these are vague and uncosted promises cynically designed to reassure discontented Labour voters that the Lib Dems are a \"nice party\" for whom they can vote. But the pledges sound specific to us, and the party's costings - which require further scrutiny - have not yet collapsed under fire. If they are attractive - well - perhaps there is a lesson there for Labour. </p> <p>There was a limited outbreak of genuine and interesting disagreement yesterday. Some, like the Oxford West MP Evan Harris, were suspicious that the omission of a pledge on free NHS eye and dental check-ups might represent policy-making by stealth. Others, like Donnachadh McCarthy, the delegate from Camberwell and Peckham, bridled at the party's increasingly explicit embrace of market and co-payment solutions in universal services like the NHS and the pensions system. But it is easy to make too much of such arguments. It is inevitable - and healthy - that parties should be coalitions. A political party that refuses to embrace people and traditions with differing outlooks does not exist outside China and North Korea (and perhaps the US Republicans). In the past, yesterday's argument would have been far more passionate and divisive. What was striking yesterday, and even a little alarming for traditional admirers of the third party, was the number of times that speakers called for Lib Dems to be on-message. </p> <p>If they are united about one thing, it is the belief that Tony Blair is finished and discredited. Yet it has to be faced that Mr Blair is in many (though crucially not all) respects, the godfather of the kind of political programme that the Lib Dems are beginning to forge. Mr Blair's genius is to have developed a programme and a politics which reached across the left and centre in an unprecedented manner. If his project is now collapsing after the destruction of trust caused by Iraq - an open question - then one of the key issues in British politics at the end of this decade will be whether post-Blair Labour continues to hold that ground, or whether some other party can inherit it instead. Yesterday's debate and the new pre-manifesto show that Mr Kennedy's party is positioning itself to do precisely that. Exciting times indeed.</p>",
  "<p>The US government opened a $280bn civil trial against the giants of the tobacco industry yesterday, arguing that the firms conspired for decades to hide the dangers of smoking, and illegally marketed cigarettes to children. </p> <p>In the biggest tobacco trial to date, lawyers for the US justice department used racketeering legislation originally designed to fight the mafia to sue for the recovery of $280bn (about \u00a3160bn) in \"ill-gotten gains\" from nine tobacco companies and two industry groups. The defendants include Marlboro-maker Philip Morris, the Camel cigarette group RJ Reynolds and two businesses associated with the UK's British American Tobacco. </p> <p>The landmark case, five years in the making, could also lead to tighter tobacco legislation, including a ban on such descriptions as \"low tar\" and \"light\" cigarettes. </p> <p>In opening statements, lawyers described a clandestine campaign by the tobacco industry to combat the growing body of scientific evidence linking smoking to disease, beginning with a secret strategy session at the Plaza Hotel in New York in December 1953. </p> <p>\"The industry believed its survival depended on fraud,\" said Frank Marine, a lawyer for the justice department. \"The defendants well knew that scientific evidence had established a causal link between smoking and cancer and other diseases.\" </p> <p>The meeting at the Plaza of tobacco executives and a public relations firm led to the creation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, whose mission most emphatically was not to explore the potential dangers of smoking, but to sow confusion about established links between cigarettes and smokers' diseases, Mr Marine said. </p> <p>Another industry group, the Centre for Indoor Air Research, was established later when evidence began to emerge of the dangers of passive smoking. </p> <p>\"The problem was not that their products were killing people,\" Mr Marine said. \"Their problem was that people might stop smoking because of health concerns.\" </p> <p>The executives apparently were pleased with the results of their research councils - \"the best and cheapest insurance the tobacco industry can buy\", one internal company memo said. Another memo warned that it was essential to provide smokers with the \"psychological crutch and some rationale to continue smoking\". </p> <p>But, according to the justice department, the conspiracy by the industry went beyond a campaign to discredit scientific research on the dangers of smoking. </p> <p>The industry continually sought to expand its pool of potential customers by exploiting the addictive properties of nicotine, and by marketing cigarettes to young people - replacements for smokers who had died off, said another justice department lawyer, Sharon Eubanks. </p> <p>\"The defendants designed cigarettes to make sure smokers had sufficient nicotine to become dependent on their addiction,\" she said. \"The defendants' intention was to engineer cigarettes to deliver addictive levels of nicotine.\" </p> <p>Lawyers for the tobacco industry are to make opening statements today in a trial expected to call 300 witnesses, and last for six months. They are expected to argue that, while tobacco executives may have dismissed health concerns about smoking in the past, that does not constitute fraud. </p> <p>\"Fraud is, 'I have a specific intention to mislead you or take money from you by deceiving you',\" William Ohlemeyer, a lawyer for Philip Morris USA, told reporters. \"Fraud is a very high bar.\" </p> <p>Defendants in the case include: Philip Morris USA Inc. and its parent, Altria Group Inc; RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co; Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co; BAT (Investments) Ltd; Lorillard Tobacco Co; Liggett Group Inc; Council for Tobacco Research-USA; and the Tobacco Institute. </p> <p>Brown &amp; Williamson used to be wholly owned by BAT but was merged earlier this year with RJR's US business. BAT (Investments) is a scientific research centre still owned by BAT. </p> <p>The courtroom battle is seen by anti-smoking advocates as the pinnacle of tobacco legislation, both for the size of the damages sought and because it is being brought by the US government. </p> <p>The justice department initially had sought to recover the costs of treating illnesses caused by smoking. The judge, Gladys Kessler, ruled out that course of action, but did allow the department to sue under racketeering statutes originally designed for organised crime.</p>",
  "It was the day when a Liberal Democrat delegate could finally take no more. Councillor Michael Newby, who has the good fortune to represent Harrogate and Knaresborough, told the delegates in Bournemouth that the time had come for them to go beyond political jargon. <p>Go beyond political jargon? You could almost see the baffled Lib Dems asking themselves: where on earth to? Mr Newby even told them that they were in danger of telling the world, \"I am a political anorak.\" Of course they are, and they're proud of it. To an anorak, the term is the highest praise. </p> <p>Mr Newby had been driven to this near blasphemy by the motion on \"making markets work for the environment\". This consisted of 56 lines, much of it jargon. Mr Newby read out long swaths of this document in a rapid, singsong voice just to stress how meaningless it would be if it should ever be presented to a real voter. </p> <p>It talked about \"cap and trade\" in a context of an \"overall cap\", \"public subsidies for unsustainable activities\", \"landfill allowance trading schemes\", and is packed with acronyms such as Euets, APD, ADD and VED, all no doubt perfectly comprehensible to people in eco-land, but entirely meaningless to everyone else. </p> <p>Mr Newby then read out paragraph seven: introduction of a plastic bag environmental levy, subject to a full lifecycle analysis demonstrating that such a levy would produce a net environmental benefit. </p> <p>\"We have to go beyond political jargon,\" he said. \"I understand what we are getting at, but it won't help us on the doorstep!\" </p> <p>The two bigger parties like to depict the Lib Dems as evil, machiavellian opportunists, lying and cheating their way to control of local councils. I think of them more like the folk in Bournemouth, earnestly discussing on the doorstep overall caps and plastic bag levies, before going off for an environmentally sustainable yoghurt sandwich. </p> <p>Earlier they had heard a speech from their environment spokesman, Norman Baker, who is a sort of fundamentalist anorak on this topic. In fact, Mr Baker spoke twice, though it was his first speech that grabbed the attention, being slightly batty, one pylon short of a wind farm. </p> <p>He described the coming end of the world, with much the same relish as those sects who sit on high hills to await Armageddon. Gazing down on all those 4x4 cars in cities, unrecycled bottles and plastic bags, he predicted innumerable horrors, and capped it with a Chinese proverb. </p> <p>There seems to be a Chinese proverb for every occasion, and I sometimes wonder whether Chinese people actually use them themselves. This one was: \"If we continue down the road which we appear to have chosen, the danger exists that we may end up exactly where we are heading.\" </p> <p>This translates into English as: \"If we set off somewhere, we might well get there.\" You can make them up. \"A mobile phone is only mobile if you carry it somewhere,\" for instance. </p> <p>He announced that \"Charles Kennedy and I are determined that wherever you bite into the Lib Dem stick of rock, you will find the word 'environment' writ large!\" </p> <p>He wound up with one of the great political rallying cries. \"In our modest way we have at this conference replaced plastic holders with bags from sustainable jute, and why all future Lib Dem conferences will be carbon neutral!\"</p>",
  "<p>A House of Lords committee today wades into a row over European \"gender equality\" proposals, with peers warning women could lose out when it comes to motor insurance, life cover and annuities. </p> <p>In a new report, an all-party committee of peers calls on the European commission to rethink the detail of its proposals to extend sexual equality legislation to the supply of goods and services. They highlight fears that young women drivers could see their car insurance premiums rise by up to 40% if the plans become law. </p> <p>A draft European Union directive being discussed by EU ministers would prohibit the use of gender as a factor in cal culating premiums. This would particularly affect motor cover, where women tend to pay less because they are deemed safer drivers, and life insurance, which is cheaper for women as they generally live longer. For the same reason, women fare less well when it comes to swapping their pension pot for an annuity, the product that provides an income for life. </p> <p>Insurers have claimed the proposals would put millions of people in Britain at a disadvantage, and earlier this year the Financial Services Authority warned the directive was likely to hinder the development of an efficient insurance market. </p> <p>The Lords say the proposals would lead to \"anomalies and inconsistencies\" and call for more research to be done. </p> <p>The peers are not convinced that the consequences of the directive's measures on insurance have been investigated thoroughly enough. They say women drivers should not have to pay more for motor cover for the sake of sex equality when young male drivers have far worse accident and conviction records. </p> <p>The FSA has told the peers it believes young female drivers are likely to see their premiums rise by between 10% and 30% if the draft directive becomes law. One women's insurance specialist, Diamond, said it believed the figure could be 25%-40%. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the introduction of \"gender neutral\" pricing could drive up women's life insurance premiums by as much as 16%, with a corresponding fall in comparable male premiums of about 8%. </p> <p>The directive should in theory mean a better deal for women on annuities, increasing the annual income a 60-year-old woman would be able to purchase by 2% and reducing the revenue a man of the same age could purchase by 3%. But as most annuity holders are male, \"many women who depend on the annuities of male breadwinners stand to lose out\", said chairman of the inquiry, Lord Williamson of Horton. The report comes ahead of a meeting in Brussels on October 4 when EU ministers are due to discuss the draft directive.</p>",
  "<p>Batman climbs the Palace, protesters storm the Commons, Britney does it again, Star Wars comes out on DVD and Hurricane Ivan is still blowing. Just when you think it's been a crazy month, you discover senior radio executives are causing a bit of a storm themselves with all this press about mergers and forthcoming licence applications. </p> <p>The big news this week of course is that finally, the long-awaited merger between Capital and GWR seems to be on. If the talks that they've now admitted to having are fruitful the deal will lead to the formation of the largest radio group in the UK. Should the listener be concerned? I don't think so as the output of radio stations in the UK is protected by a \"format\" that is set in stone and ensures that stations cannot change their character without prior regulator approval. Furthermore there is no evidence to suggest a number of stations under a single owner had any detrimental effect on the output. </p> <p>Surprisingly, under the Radio Authority's tenure Capital and GWR have never won a radio licence in the UK so they will be hopeful that this new regulator will look on them more favourably. You cannot buy a new radio licence. Instead you have to apply for one with an application that, hopefully, wows them. For example, what's in it for the people in the area you are going to serve and how it will be different to all the others on the dial? </p> <p>In the past it was a bit like a beauty contest, with groups submitting stunningly presented proposals complete with gimmicks, stylish videos, creative ideas and colourful effects in an effort to attract the attention of the judging panel.</p> <p>But not any more, as this Thursday sees the deadline for applications for the new Edinburgh licence, which will serve a population of around 1 million adults. We're assured that the new regulator will be looking for much more substance (not gloss) this time around when assessing the dozen or so applications expected. </p> <p>The application process will be a bit of a learning curve for all involved as we get to grips with what is expected from a new regulator. My initial view is that the whole procedure seems to have been made considerably easier. For example, we're no longer expected to destroy several small forests while compiling the equivalent to War and Peace, as applications are submitted electronically. Ofcom has streamlined the process and expects us to get straight down to the nitty gritty and provide hard evidence on whether proposals add to choice in the market, prove there's a demand and can sustain it as a viable business. </p> <p>Research and the ability to demonstrate financial clout are obviously important. At GMG we've got both by the bucketload, so I hope it will stand us in good stead. But who knows? One thing that I'm sure won't have changed is that no applicant has a clue who's going to win. We all speculate, convince ourselves it's us and nobody else has a chance. Then a few days after the closing date, we view all the applications in full on the Ofcom website (another welcome modernisation) and only then do you (perhaps) admit that one or two might give us some tough competition. Never something to be admitted to the press of course.</p> <p>Having spent some 20 years in radio the one prediction that is always true is that it's impossible to predict the winner. It's a bit like announcing a new Pope. You wait and wait (about three months for a decision) and then you celebrate or throw yourself off the nearest bridge depending on the outcome. If it's the latter, you drown your sorrows and convince yourself you were robbed. </p> <p>So as the starter gun is fired on a new wave of licence applications, we at GMG Radio look forward to demonstrating clearly why Smooth fm in Edinburgh should be the winner while at the same time every other group will be doing the same. It will be a tough decision. It's why we are in radio. We love it all, the personalities, the pressure, the waiting, the arguments and of course the winning. It's only the losing that cuts you up. </p> <p>Mind you, if we don't win, we can always speculate about consolidation again.

  "<p>A new security initiative to protect journalists from kidnap and attack was launched yesterday, including the possible adoption of a Red Cross-style international emblem for the press.</p> <p>The global initiative, which is led by the International Federation of Journalists, comes in the wake of a spate of kidnappings in Iraq, including that of 23-year-old British journalist James Brandon, who was abducted in Basra before being freed by Iraqi militants last month.</p> <p>An emblem would be one way of giving journalists a distinguishing feature in war zones where westerners are vulnerable to attack.</p> <p>The IFJ said many governments' existing protection of journalists was \"woefully negligent\". The campaign's objectives include a new cross-border mechanism to investigate the killings of journalists and other media staff.</p> <p>Aidan White, the general secretary of the IFJ, said journalists were \"sometimes simply forgotten when it comes to the international community's concern for civilians caught in conflict... We need action now. We need governments to abide by international law and we need the killers of media staff to be brought to justice.</p> <p>\"A good start has been made, but we have to move forward with a sense of urgency that reflects the current emergency that faces media staff in conflict zones and other hostile areas.\" </p> <p>A two-day meeting was called in Geneva by the Press Emblem Campaign, which has campaigned for the adoption of an international emblem for journalists similar to the Red Cross and Red Crescent symbols used by humanitarian aid workers. The IFJ said it would now look again at the need for a new international convention and emblem. An international committee of experts will examine how safety and security can be improved. </p> <p>The calls to improve security for journalists comes amid continued uncertainty over the fate of two French reporters kidnapped by militants last month on the road between Baghdad and Najaf. Earlier this month the group holding Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot demanded a $5m (\u00a32.8m) ransom for their release. </p> <p>White said Iraq was \"at the outer limit of lawlessness... and it is journalists and those who work with them who are prominent among the victims\".</p> <p>\"We reached an important agreement that gives us an opportunity to work together on strategies that will involve media organisations, journalists' groups and colleagues from every region of the world,\" he added. </p> <p>\"We agreed that the current level of attacks on journalists and the media is intolerable and we must hold governments to account where they are failing in their responsibilities.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>In the news business, it is often easier to make headlines than money. Prannoy Roy is unusual in that he does both. Last year he created waves in India by jumping off Rupert Murdoch's Star network where his New Delhi TV had provided 24-hour rolling news for five years. </p> <p>\"The first line of our contract read 'editorial control remains with NDTV'. When we came to renewing it, Star wanted to run things their way so we agreed to disagree. We had a drink and went our own way,\" said Mr Roy. </p> <p>A canny businessman, Mr Roy had sensed an opportunity by leaving Star and created his own channel in competition with Mr Murdoch. An Indian financial institution picked up 18% of the company and Mr Roy also persuaded Standard Chartered to put up a further $12m (\u00a36.6m) for 14% of the shares. </p> <p>The former economist also tapped the stock market in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) for 1bn rupees (\u00a312.5m) in April. A familiar face on his own programmes, shareholders were convinced that Mr Roy would succeed in providing profits from television news. </p> <p>Their faith has been vindicated. Mr Roy's two channels - NDTV, which broadcasts in English, and NDTV India, whose programming is in Hindi - have established themselves as the number one and number two channels in their sectors. His recent quarterly results, \u00a31m profit from \u00a35m of advertising revenue, also buoyed investor sentiment. </p> <p>Resolutely upmarket in its production values and the stories it chooses to cover, NDTV's rise can also boast having pushed Star News into a distant fourth place. Many media commentators had prophesised that Mr Roy's venture would be blown out of the water by Star News's cash. </p> <p>Domination by politics and business stories often makes watching NDTV a little like sitting through an extended Newsnight, but Mr Roy is unapologetic about the seriousness of the journalism. </p> <p>\"The good thing about this business is that viewers respect professionalism, they respect independence, and they know it is not just about money. We have been consistently credible over many years. The people like that,\" he says. </p> <p>Mr Roy's serious programming means that he turned down a recent scoop, involving hidden cameras, about paedophiles in India. NDTV also has a reputation for holding back its stories until they are confirmed - almost unheard of in the cut-throat world of Indian television. </p> <p>\"We were offered the paedophile story first but I found it a little over the top. It was, I felt, a little too exploitative and really the film should have been shown to the police first so that they could have arrested the culprits. To expose corruption is fine. I just find it unethical to use children to get viewership.\" </p> <p>If this all seems a little high-minded, it is worth remembering that India's democracy has always encouraged intellectual pursuits to operate in a marketplace of ideas. It has only recently become influenced by profits and losses. </p> <p>The result is that India's television landscape is now a different country from that encountered by the viewer a decade ago. A country that took 50 years to provide 8m telephone lines to 900 million people suddenly spawned 50m cable homes after satellite television arrived. </p> <p>Until 1992 television was the preserve of the lumbering state broadcaster, Doordarshan. Now 10 new news channels launch every year and it is estimated 44 mini-CNNs beam into India 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Many of the new stations grew out of news programmes commissioned by Doordarshan, which started outsourcing production work in the early 1990s as India liberalised. </p> <p>\"NDTV began life as the first nightly news show on the state broadcaster. I remember saying we are live on air and mentioning the time and the next day I got a call from the information ministry asking us not to scare people with the thought of live television news.\" </p> <p>Another reason for the fizziness in Indian television is the plummeting cost of technology. \"Five years ago to rent space on a satellite annually would cost you $3m, today it costs just $300,000. Cameras cost you one tenth of the price now. The same with editing suites. You are looking at a 75% to 90% drop in the cost in starting a news channel.\" </p> <p>Cable arrived in a big way in India by 1989, followed a year or two later by satellite, helped by the first Gulf war. These days the television is India's hottest piece of real estate. Star has announced plans to bring Sky-style set-top boxes to Indian living rooms and a plethora of new technologies, such as TiVo-type products, tantalisingly close to the market. For Mr Roy, new technologies offer new ways of making money. Cable penetration is only 50% which, he says, is a number that will inevitably rise. There is also the fact that subscription will be increasingly important as set-top boxes become prevalent. </p> <p>Mr Roy also cites India's insatiable thirst for politics as a reason for his news channel's success. \"If you look at front pages of Delhi's newspapers, 80-90% are politics. I would say newspapers around the world have less than half by comparison. In India, the main topic of discussion at most social gatherings is politics. Everybody has the answer to India's problems and they are dying to tell you.\" </p> <p>There is another more Murdochian explanation why the subcontinent views politics as a pastime. \"Sports is not developed here. Just look at the Olympics [India's medal tally was a solitary silver]. In England the office discussion will be about which football team won last night. Here there is very little interest in even the cricket national league. Politics is our sports. If politicians want to get out of the media lens then they should develop sports in the country.\" </p> <p>His latest project appears to be a busi ness channel to challenge the market leader, CNBC, which is run by US network NBC and is backed by General Electric. India's middle classes are entranced by the country's \u00a3150bn stock market and Mr Roy has threatened CNBC by running seven hours of continuous business news. \"We are ahead of CNBC from 1 to 4 o'clock during the day. [A new business channel] is a possibility.\" </p> <p>With an Irish mother and seven years at university in London, Mr Roy is a self-styled global Indian. He can effortlessly hold forth on British newspapers and US cable structures. NDTV, he says, is looking at a deal to beam into Britain. \"The real interest here in India is on four countries - China, Pakistan, England, America. These dominate 80% of the public consciousness.\" </p> <p>A proto-media mogul, Mr Roy can at times sound like his former partner, Rupert Murdoch. \"Given the size of the Diaspora in say America, Africa or South East Asia there is certainly an audience for a global channel for the global Indian.\" </p> <p>But for now, India appears a big enough country to conquer. \"It is something we will look at, but in the future.\"</p>",
  "<p>David and Victoria Beckham are to sue the News of the World over a story that claimed their marriage was in trouble. </p> <p>A statement from the couple's lawyers said the allegations, in an article headlined Posh and Becks on rocks, was untrue and \"caused considerable distress to both the couple and their family\". </p> <p>Sources at the News of the World said the paper would fight the legal challenge, in particular because the couple have never denied that the Real Madrid striker and England captain had an affair with his former personal assistant, Rebecca Loos. </p> <p>The couple's statement, issued by the law firm Harbottle and Lewis, said: \"The News of the World was given the opportunity to provide an apology but have chosen not to respond to the couple's request.\" </p> <p>The paper would not comment on the announcement, but a source quoted by the Press Association said: \"The prospect of Victoria Beckham and Rebecca Loos face-to-face in court would be too good an opportunity to miss.\" </p> <p>The story, published at the weekend, was firmly denied at the time. </p> <p>Unusually, the News of the World's sister paper, the Sun, ran a story the next day that carried the denial prominently.</p>",
  "In Lagos, expect chaos. There are gun battles in Bogot\u00e1. Crime has been a curse in Karachi. But there is nowhere on earth quite like this. <p>According to a survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, the capital of Papua New Guinea has beaten all-comers - again - to take a title that no city on earth would covet. </p> <p>With poverty, crime, poor healthcare and a rampant gang culture, Port Moresby consistently scores highest in the unit's \"hardship\" table, meaning it is regarded as the worst place to live among 130 world capitals. Baghdad is not on the list. </p> <p>According to the unit, most aspects of daily life in Moresby are problematic. </p> <p>Little bigger than Plymouth, with a population of 250,000, it is a place where murder rates are exceptionally high, thanks mainly to the \"raskol\" gangs that control large areas of the city. </p> <p>Tales of their exploits are legion; from bank robberies with M-16 machine guns, to car holdups by mobs armed with machetes. </p> <p>Rape cases are even worse: in one widely reported incident last year, an injured nurse was dragged away from a car crash to be gang-raped. </p> <p>Visitors to Port Moresby are advised not to go out after sunset, and to avoid walking the streets in most areas even during the day. </p> <p>The houses of the wealthy squat behind walls tipped with razor-wire and gates watched by security guards. </p> <p>The precautions are necessary because a survey of international crime by the Home Office shows that the murder rate there is three times that of Moscow, and 23 times that of London. </p> <p>The rates for robberies and rapes are just as dire. </p> <p>But the raskols say much of the violence is meted out by the police, and that they are provoked into retaliation. </p> <p>The base of Moresby's Bomai gang can be found up a dark sidestreet in the suburb of Four Mile. At the entrance to their squatter settlement a man is on guard, armed with a walkie-talkie. </p> <p>\"The police we know are very dangerous. They come in to the settlement and raid the people's food and property and beers,\" says Koiva, one of the leaders of the gang. </p> <p>He has a pattern of welts on his head where he says he was beaten by a police officer with a glass bottle to extract a confession. </p> <p>Another gang member, Stephen, shows two dark scars on his legs which he says were caused when he was shot in police custody. </p> <p>Most people living in Port Moresby show little sympathy for the Bomai, whose raids on businesses and residential compounds have made them infamous. \"Bloody raskols. Shoot first and ask questions later, that's what they [the police] should do,\" says an Australian expatriate. </p> <p>Often, that is precisely what happens. </p> <p>\"I think the government are happy every time the police shoot a young man but we have thousands more youths on the streets,\" says Peter Gola, a former raskol working at City Mission, a charity that helps the city's street children. </p> <p>Most raskols argue that their crimes are driven by the crushing poverty of life. </p> <p>\"We never mean to kill people,\" says Koiva. \"We're just trying to scare them and get what we want to get.\" </p> <p>Papua New Guinea has no welfare state, so in rural areas family and clan networks have kept people in food and lodging. That system has broken down in the capital, which sits in an arid part of the country where unemployment rates are estimated to be between 60- and 90%. </p> <p>A kilo of rice here costs four kina - about 70p - and a tin of fish is three kina, but this is beyond the means of many families. </p> <p>Most raskols say they get into crime when their parents send them out to make money. Pressured to generate an income, they turn to violence. An armed robbery can easily net more than 100,000 kina (\u00a317,500). </p> <p>\"When that happens, we live like kings,\" says Harris, another Bomai member. \"If you're lucky, you eat something good. Maybe chicken.\" </p> <p>But there is some hope for change. Twenty minutes' drive from Moresby, City Mission's New Life farm has offered an alternative to the violence for between 5,000 and 6,000 street children since it opened 11 years ago. </p> <p>The regime is strict: smoking and drinking are forbidden and there is a strong religious flavour to the instruction. </p> <p>But the founder, Larry George, says the structure and respect of their new lives can work wonders. </p> <p>\"Most of them aren't bad kids,\" says Mr George. \"It's mainly just poverty that's driving the crime. People can read in the papers about the government stealing millions of kina and get really frustrated.\" </p> <p>Many of the children, he says, end up as security guards, exchanging fire with the raskols who were once their peers.</p> <p><b>Global ranking</b></p> <p>Best five </p> <p><b>1=</b> Melbourne, Australia </p> <p><b>1=</b> Vancouver, Canada </p> <p><b>1=</b> Vienna, Austria </p> <p><b>4</b> Perth, Australia </p> <p><b>5</b> Geneva, Switzerland </p> <p>Worst five </p> <p><b>126</b> Phnom Penh, Cambodia </p> <p><b>127</b> Lagos, Nigeria </p> <p><b>128</b> Dhaka, Bangladesh </p> <p><b>129</b> Karachi, Pakistan </p> <p><b>130</b> Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea</p>",
  "President George Bush yesterday delivered an unrepentant speech to the United Nations defending the war in Iraq and calling on the world to help rebuild the country. <p>Declaring his confidence that \"this young century will be liberty's century\", Mr Bush told the UN general assembly in New York that Iraq and Afghanistan were poised to become examples for the rest of the Middle East of peaceful, democratic societies. </p> <p>Coming six weeks before the US elections, the speech appeared essentially tailored for a domestic audience rather than foreign consumption. </p> <p>In response to Mr Bush's speech, Democratic presidential challenger John Kerry said last night: \"Iraq is in crisis and the president needs to live in the world of reality, not in a world of fantasy spin. </p> <p>\"The president really has no credibility at this point. He has no credibility with foreign leaders who hear him come before them and talk as if everything is going well ...\" </p> <p>By conflating the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq he also sought to tie the Iraq war, which remains unpopular with American voters, more closely to his \"war on terror\", where polls show he is stronger. </p> <p>In the 24-minute address to the 191-country gathering, Mr Bush was unapologetic about his decision to invade Iraq, arguing that he had \"helped deliver the Iraqi people from a brutal dictator\" while enforcing international will. </p> <p>\"The security council promised serious consequences for [Saddam Hussein's] defiance,\" said Mr Bush, spelling out his justification for going to war without that council's approval. And the commitments we make must have meaning. When we say serious consequences, for the sake of peace there must be serious consequences. And so a coalition of nations enforced the just demands of the world.\" </p> <p>Minutes earlier, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, delivered a scarcely veiled criticism of US foreign policy as he chided those countries which \"shamelessly disregarded\" international law. </p> <p>\"Those who seek to bestow legitimacy must themselves embody it, and those who invoke international law must themselves submit to it,\" said Mr Annan, who last week branded the US-led invasion of Iraq illegal under international law. \"We must start from the principle that no one is above the law, and no one should be denied its protection.\" </p> <p>The criticism of the US was not addressed by the president, who went on to call on world leaders to assist the US in rebuilding Iraq, a request that has gone unheeded several times before. </p> <p>\"The government of prime minister Allawi has earned the support of every nation that believes in self-determination and desires peace,\" he said. \"The UN and its member nations must ... do more to help build an Iraq that is secure, democratic, federal and free.\" </p> <p>Playing down the instability and huge loss of life of Iraqi civilians and US soldiers, Mr Bush said: \"Not long ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul threatened the peace and sponsored terrorists ... Today the Iraqi and Afghan people are on the path to democracy and freedom. These two nations will be a model for the broader Middle East.\" </p> <p>Warning that there would be worse days ahead, Mr Bush conceded that \"we can expect terror attacks to escalate\" as elections approach in Afghanistan and Iraq. But he vowed that his mission was \"not to retreat, it is to prevail ... We will be standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq until their hopes for freedom and liberty are fulfilled.\" </p> <p>Coming the day after Mr Kerry, accused him of \"stubborn incompetence\" and \"colossal failures in judgment\" on the war in Iraq, Mr Bush will have been acutely aware of his domestic audience. </p> <p>Polls show a contradictory view among Americans with regards to Mr Bush's foreign policy. He is well-regarded in his prosecution of his war on terror, much less so on his handling of Iraq. </p> <p>His speech attempted to balance these factors by broadening it to the fight against Aids, relieving developing countries' debt and promoting \"hope and progress as the alternatives to hatred and violence\". </p> <p>He lambasted the Palestin ian leadership but also delivered rare, if gentle, criticism of Israel, calling on the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, to impose a freeze on settlements in the West Bank and Gaza and to dismantle \"unauthorised outposts\". </p> <p>He also called for an international ban on human cloning and proposed establishing a new \"democracy fund\" within the UN to help countries institute the rule of law and hold free elections. </p> <p>Reaction to Mr Bush's speech, which received only moderate applause, was initially sparse. The Swiss president, Joseph Deiss, said: \"In hindsight, experience shows that actions taken without a mandate which has been clearly defined in a security council resolution are doomed to failure.\"</p>",
  "Kamlesh Bahl, the former Law Society vice-president who lost a sex and race discrimination claim against the solicitors' professional body, is facing moves which could make her bankrupt over a costs bill of \u00a3137,000. <p>Last week she was served with papers demanding payment, the first step towards enforcing the costs order by bankruptcy. </p> <p>It is the latest development in a row between the society and the woman it once hoped would be its first female and ethnic minority president, which has so far lasted four and a half years and cost around \u00a32.5m. </p> <p>The society's governing council is due to vote tomor row on a motion from Ms Bahl asking it not to enforce the costs order. </p> <p>Ms Bahl, 47, was set to become president of the body representing solicitors in England and Wales when five staff accused her of bullying. </p> <p>An independent inquiry headed by a former law lord upheld the allegations and she was forced out in March 2000. </p> <p>She launched a claim for race and sex discrimination against the society, its then president, Robert Sayer, and secretary general, Jane Betts, which she initially won at an employment tribunal. </p> <p>But the ruling was overturned by the employment appeal tribunal, which dismissed some of her claims as \"ludicrous\" and she lost again at the court of appeal. </p> <p>On July 30 the appeal court ordered her to pay \u00a3137, 000 towards the society's costs within 14 days. </p> <p>Her solicitor said yesterday he understood the total costs were likely to reach \u00a3300,000 but the Law Society said no final figure was yet available. </p> <p>Ms Bahl made a comeback to the council, where she won a seat for ethnic minority solicitors. She also launched a fresh tribunal claim, accusing the society of discriminating against her by refusing to fund her original case against it while paying for the defences of Mr Sayer and Ms Betts. </p> <p>Ms Bahl has refused to sign a compromise deal put forward by the society under which it would forgo the appeal court costs if she agreed to resign from the council, drop her claims and undertake not to take any further action.</p>",
  "A psychotherapist was jailed for murder yesterday, after she killed a man with a shot in the stomach when he interrupted her in an attempt to kill the girlfriend of her former lover. <p>Heather Stephenson-Snell, 46, the former president of an all-female chapter of the Hell's Angels, had planned to murder Diane Lomax and frame her former lover, Adrian Sinclair. </p> <p>Yesterday a jury at Manchester crown court found her guilty of Ms Lomax's attempted murder and the murder of Robert Wilkie, who left a neighbouring house in Radcliffe, Manchester, to see what the disturbance was. She had denied both charges. </p> <p>But the court had heard that the Canadian national had drawn up an elaborate plot detailed on handwritten index cards which were later found by police. It included plans to make it look as though Mr Sinclair were responsible. </p> <p>She had taken shooting lessons, worked out escape routes, studied Ms Lomax's home and even stored possible escape vehicles at the homes of friends before striking on Halloween last year, disguised in a ghost costume and a mask from the film Scream. </p> <p>Mr Justice Wakerley sentenced Stephenson-Snell to life imprisonment and said she would serve a minimum of 22 years for murder. He added that the psychotherapist, who suffered from a personality disorder, always sought to be the centre of attention. </p> <p>\"The plans you made were breathtaking,\" he said. \"You planned your escape meticulously and you had planned to frame Sinclair.\" </p> <p>\"Your lies were breathtaking and shameless and I note that you have shown absolutely no hint of remorse at what you have done ... you knew perfectly well what you were doing.\" </p> <p>The court heard that Stephenson-Snell had met Mr Sinclair when he responded to her advert looking for a live-in dog sitter. </p> <p>They split up when she decided that he was not suitable to look after her two dogs, but she became obsessed with him after he began a relationship with Ms Lomax. </p> <p>She began bombarding the couple with abusive phone calls and death threats and making malicious allegations about them to police. </p> <p>But the harassment stopped in spring last year as she began to plot Ms Lomax's murder. </p> <p>Detective Superintendent Simon Barraclough of Greater Manchester police, who led the investigation, described Stephenson-Snell as a danger to society and \"one of the most peculiar individuals I have ever had to deal with\". </p> <p>He said her victim had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p> <p>Mr Wilkie died almost instantly when Stephenson-Snell shot him at point blank range in the stomach as he tried to remove her mask. He had left the neighbouring house to remonstrate with her as she hammered on the door of Ms Lomax's home. </p> <p>Stephenson-Snell fled the scene but was stopped by police in West Yorkshire shortly afterwards because she was driving so slowly along the M62. She gave a false name but was arrested after officers found the shotgun hidden under the bloodstained sheet she had been wearing as part of her disguise.</p>",
  "<p>Criticising EastEnders is something of a sport among television reviewers, with the ailing soap getting more of a battering than a haddock in Ian Beale's chip shop. </p> <p>Yesterday, after falling ratings, sex scandals and concern at the quality of scripts, the BBC responded by replacing the programme's executive producer. </p> <p>Louise Berridge would move to an unspecified \"major new drama project\", the corporation said. </p> <p>The soap's performance has a significant impact on the rest of the BBC1 schedule, but a BBC spokeswoman insisted that Ms Berridge had not been forced to step down. </p> <p>Her future had been the subject of speculation as criticism surrounding the series became intense. Only last week the BBC announced she would step back from the day-to-day running of the soap, with the appointment of a senior producer, Sharon Hughff, as her deputy. </p> <p>In a prepared statement, Mal Young, the BBC's controller of continuing drama series, praised Ms Berridge's two-year tenure. \"This must be the toughest programme-making role on British TV. Louise has done a superb job, overseeing some of the most talked about telly moments of the last three years. It's a relentless job, both as manager and lead creative of over 200 hours of primetime drama, in a very public spotlight. There are not many people talented or resilient enough to handle this job, and Louise has proved herself one of the few.\" </p> <p>Such warm words were not enough to melt the ice that has been forming around Ms Berridge. Her departure had been widely predicted, and the BBC1 controller, Lorraine Heggessey, was forced to defend her at the Edinburgh television festival last month, saying she was the victim of circumstances beyond her control. </p> <p>\"When you have a cast where one is ill, one pregnant, one who may be in rehab, and another in a car crash, that's when you end up being overdependent on a storyline about a kidney transplant,\" she said, referring to a much-criticised plot that was stretched beyond credibility due to cast absences. </p> <p>It is true that the fortunes of soaps go in cycles: in 2001 EastEnders' ITV rival Coronation Street was at the receiving end of opprobrium, and only recovered when its executive producer was replaced. Now it is EastEnders' turn. </p> <p>Many of the brickbats have been directed at the relentless misery of life in Albert Square. In a radio interview two weeks ago, Mr Young defended the bleak storylines: \"We have always been good at creating great kitchen sink drama. That's why people watch it. They want to wallow in the misery with us. You can come home from work and think, 'Well, at least my life is better than that lot.'\" </p> <p>The viewers did not agree. The return last year of \"Dirty\" Den Watts attracted nearly 17 million viewers. But the effect was short-lived, and last May the ratings fell to 6.4 million, the lowest in the programme's 20-year history, when ITV scheduled an episode of Emmerdale against it. </p> <p>Ms Berridge will be replaced by Kathleen Hutchison, executive producer of Holby City, the soapy medical drama that runs all year round, from where Ms Hughff was also transferred. \"Soap reaches the hearts of the nation with iconic characters and stories,\" Ms Hutchison said. </p> <p>Critics will be looking for her to introduce some of these characteristics to EastEnders, which has been plagued by script weaknesses, cast problems and the failure of new characters such as the Ferreira family, slated by British Asians for being woefully unbelievable. </p> <p>The off-screen antics of the stars have also threatened to provide more entertainment than the storylines; the most notorious red-top revelation was that Leslie Grantham, who plays Dirty Den, had been indulging in internet sex during breaks in filming. </p> <p>In her statement, Ms Berridge said: \"It's been a privilege to lead BBC1's number one show through the last two years, even when faced with the unexpected.\" It was unclear whether the irony was intended. </p> <p><strong> What the critics say ... </strong> <br></p> <p>My tapes of last week's EastEnders arrived with a note saying: \"Apologies for poor quality of pictures.\" Not a word though, about the abysmal quality of the writing and acting <br> <strong> Charlie Catchpole, Daily Express, September 6 2004 </strong> <br> </p> <p>This week EastEnders decided they really wanted us to suffer, so they made us watch Ian Beale flirting.

  "<p>MPs and peers have warned that a compromise agreed in the parliamentary row over a legal ban on smacking children is likely to be found incompatible with the European convention on human rights in the future.</p> <p>The joint parliamentary committee on human rights yesterday published a report on the children bill now going through parliament, which has sparked a furious debate over a smacking ban.</p> <p>As the law now stands, parents are allowed to smack their children and can use a defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" if cases of common assault, wounding, grievous bodily harm or cruelty to persons under sixteen are brought against them because of injuries inflicted.</p> <p>Children's charities and other proponents of a smacking ban have urged that this defence be abolished in the children bill, effectively making smacking or beating children illegal. But ministers were worried that parents might be criminalised for trying to control their children.</p> <p>In July a compromise amendment to the bill was moved in the House of Lords to retain the \"reasonable chastisement\" defence in cases of common assault, but remove it in cases where parents face more serious charges. The compromise is understood to allow parents to smack their children - but not too hard.</p> <p>The joint human rights committee's report said the amendment will probably bring British law into line with a recent judgement by the European court of human rights, because it makes the defence unavailable where corporal punishment has breached article three of the European human rights convention.</p> <p>But the MPs and peers on the committee warned that in future the reasonable chastisement defence may be held to be incompatible with convention rights because the European court is increasingly referring to the UN convention on the rights of the child in its decisions - a convention that gives children greater protection.</p> <p>This means the children bill, as amended, might only temporarily meet the UK's human rights obligations.</p> <p>The committee also warned that children bill measures designed to make agencies delivering children's services work together were not strong enough.</p> <p>The duty on \"partner agencies\" to cooperate \"should be clarified to make quite explicit that it is an ongoing duty\", the report says. The duty should be \"direct\" rather than \"procedural\" and must be directly applied to private companies providing services under contract to public sector agencies.</p> <p>The MPs and peers also condemned the exclusion of immigration and asylum agencies from the duty to cooperate as \"unjustifiable discrimination against some children on grounds of nationality\".</p> <p>But the committee welcomed the creation of a statutory commissioner for children and young people in the bill.</p>",
  "<p>The national service framework for children (NSF), the government's blueprint for transforming children's health services published last week, has ambitious aims to send the clearest possible indications to the NHS and social services as to what type of care children with different needs should receive. In principle there's much to admire - but how much difference can it make in practice? </p> <p>As the mother of two autistic sons, I'm particularly pleased about the strong focus on autism. One of the framework's two given exemplars of a child's \"journey through care\" concerns autism. Autism has some physical manifestations, but it isn't a medical condition or a disease. Many autists have learning disabilities, but other have normal or high IQs. These facts make it difficult to classify. If an autistic child has no health problems and no learning impairments in the obvious sense, which agencies should assess him and cater for him? </p> <p>Autism is more a social than a physical or intellectual handicap. Autists, as the NSF explains, have impairments of social understanding, communication and social imagination. Their rigidity of thought and obsessive behaviour makes it hard to assimilate them in a family or a classroom. One exemplar follows the fortunes of an imaginary boy called George. It rightly emphasises that, though George has \"many strengths\", his inability to understand other people, his failure to conform to any expected pattern, and his lack of interest in communicating and interacting with those around him cause behaviour problems that put a great strain on his parents and non-autistic sister, and cause George himself considerable distress. </p> <p>It makes it clear that George will need constant, expert support, probably throughout his life. In the past, autism has often been misdiagnosed and misunderstood, so it's gratifying to find it placed on an equal footing with physical ailments such as asthma and more \"visible\" genetic syndromes such as Down's. </p> <p>The framework rightly emphasises the importance of early diagnosis. This applies to all conditions, but because autistic children usually look \"normal\", it's often harder to persuade people that the child's problems are profound and permanent. The earlier the diagnosis, the earlier such help can be put in place. As the NSF says, \"Early intervention has a positive effect both in terms of promoting development, and minimising decline or regression.\" </p> <p>The NSF has many other admirable features. A lot of weight is given to the need for respite care. People often ask me: \"How do you cope?\" and my answer is: \"With help.\" Thanks to the generosity of family and friends, I get regular short breaks from my children; these enable me to enjoy a life beyond autism, keep a sense of perspective, and catch up on sleep. The document states that \"Good short-term break services are associated with reductions in maternal stress and reduction in marital problems and breakdowns.\" One shouldn't have to rely on one's family to provide them. </p> <p>Great emphasis is placed on the need for \"social inclusion\" - I'm wary of this, believing it to be a red herring when it comes to the management of autistic children, who often neither want nor need it. But I applaud the NSF's determination to see the child as a whole person and to provide maximum information and support for parents and siblings. </p> <p>The introduction to the framework explains why autism was chosen as an exemplar - \"large numbers of children and families affected, significant cause of illness and distress, wide variability in standards of practice or service provision and suitability for demonstrating the NSF themes.\" But it seems likely that the unspoken reason for choosing autism is that public service agencies are struggling to cope with the increasing numbers of autistic children. </p> <p>So, rather than being a useful illustration of the new standards, the exemplar could be a desperate attempt to control the autism crisis. To implement the NSF's recommendations, a huge amount would need to be spent on training - a strength of the document is that it recognises the need for expertise in people who work with this condition. </p> <p>George receives help from a large and varied collection of experts, from speech therapists to a Connexions personal adviser. But such people are in short supply. Here's the flaw. The government has not committed any dedicated resources - this differs from earlier NSFs for, for instance, cancer, diabetes and services for older people. Without new money, it's hard to see how the recommendations will take effect. </p> <p>As the NSF acknowledges, caring for any disabled child is expensive. Though I'm lucky to have both my boys placed in a state-funded autistic spectrum disorder facility near my home, I've had to raise all the money for childcare and therapeutic interventions myself. I hope that the framework will convince people that such \"extras\" aren't indulgencies, but vital tools in the struggle to do one's best for the exhausting, baffling, frustrating and fascinating creatures that autistic children are. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Charlotte Moore is the author of George and Sam: Autism in the Family, published by Viking.</p>",
  "Teachers at Keyworth primary school, in south-east London, had long been concerned about a child they suspected might be being abused. But it wasn't until the child saw a counsellor placed in the school by the charity Place2Be that the nature of the problems at home came to light. <p>\"After the child disclosed what was happening, social services were able to step in, and now the child is protected,\" says Edwina Nummey, deputy headteacher. \"I believe Place2Be saves lives.\" </p> <p>Keyworth is one of 92 schools across the UK in which Place2Be offers a counselling service geared towards young children. The charity, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this month, offers support to 34,000 children, with the aim of intervening early to prevent future problems. </p> <p>Children facing a range of issues - which might include bereavement, divorce, anxiety, family illness, domestic violence and bullying - can see a counsellor once a week for as long as they need to. </p> <p>Benita Refson, chief executive of Place2Be, says: \"By working with children at a young age, we help them develop a sense of resilience and an awareness that they have the strength to deal with their problems.\" </p> <p>Keyworth's designated Place2Be room is staffed two days a week by four trainee counsellors. They work on a voluntary basis and are closely supervised by the project manager, a trained psychotherapist. </p> <p>While most children are referred by concerned teachers and parents, drop-in sessions are also offered during the lunch hour, to which children can refer themselves by dropping a request into a brightly-coloured box. </p> <p>Children have responded positively, with more than 53% of pupils at the school receiving individual or group sessions, or both. An assistant project manager is soon to be added to the team. </p> <p>Nummey says the key to the service's success is its accessibility. \"When a service is in the school, relationships can be built up and the children know what it's there for,\" she says. \"That makes them happy to go. Parents are happy too, because there's no stigma attached to it.\" </p> <p>Another advantage is that children suffer minimal disruption to their school day. Counsellors collect them from the classroom and deliver them back at the end of their 50-minute sessions, and they can check on the child's progress with teachers - though the content of the sessions is confidential. Support can also be offered to parents and teachers. </p> <p>Nummey says the service is essential in a school where pupils face a range of difficulties. Keyworth has a large number of children entitled to school meals and with English as an additional language. Several arrived in the UK alone as refugees. </p> <p>\"I couldn't do my job without Place2Be,\" Nummey says. \"If it wasn't here, there would be so many times when I would want children to have that extra support and I wouldn't be able to give it to them.

  "<p>Organised crime is working with the construction industry to illegally fly-tip tens of thousands of tonnes of building rubble around Britain, avoiding millions of pounds of landfill taxes and costing landowners large amounts to clear up. </p> <p>The gangs scout available land in advance, work with two-way radios, and may descend on a site with 30 or more unidentifiable lorries in a few hours, says the Environment Agency, which is increasingly concerned over a huge rise in fly-tipping incidents. </p> <p>An unpublished study, carried out by agency staff with the Jill Dando institute of crime studies, has found that building sites, roads, fields and electricity substations are the most popular sites for large-scale dumping of building waste, but that cemeteries, hotel grounds, golf courses and sports fields are also being targeted. </p> <p>Much of the dumping is done quite openly, says the report: \"Building sites are particularly attractive since they are accessible to lorries, are flat, and do not arouse suspicion since to the bystander there is nothing wrong with lorries entering a building site.\" </p> <p>An Environment Agency spokesman said: \"Large-scale tipping appears to be happening more frequently. We are told that people are moving out of drugs and into [construction] waste because it's just as profitable and people do not tend to end up in prison.\" </p> <p>The agency says opportunistic fly-tipping by gangs and individuals has risen by 40% in the past two years and is now running at more than 65,000 incidents a month. The cost to local authorities and landowners is believed to be \u00a3100m to \u00a3150m a year. </p> <p>The rise in the past three years has been largely driven by rising landfill taxes, local authorities charging for the collection of bulky waste, and more goods such as TV sets, computers and refrigerators being defined as \"special or hazardous\" waste. </p> <p>Leeds and Birmingham are among the worst-hit areas, reporting more than 20,000 mostly small incidents a year, but gangs are now working throughout the UK, sometimes transferring waste hundreds of miles. </p> <p>In north London, more than 70,000 tonnes of construction waste was fly-tipped in 2003, costing more than \u00a31m to clean up, and avoiding \u00a3135,000 in landfill taxes. Other hotspots included the London boroughs of Harrow and Brent. Lewisham and Westminster boroughs reported 34,000 cases between them last year. Local authorities, farmers and organisations such as British Waterways, Network Rail and the National Trust all report more fly-tipping on their land. </p> <p>The large-scale tippers are resorting to new tactics, says the agency. In the north-east there have been several cases of large warehouses being rented, filled with car tyres and then abandoned. </p> <p>\"Some offenders con landowners and groundsmen into allowing delivery of what they believe to be free topsoil, only to later find hundreds of tonnes of useless waste having been deposited on their land,\" says the report. </p> <p>Much of the tipping is attributed to \"white van man\" - small businesses, jobbing builders, plumbers and gardeners. \"They are often ignorant of the alternatives,\" says the report. \"They either cannot afford to pay or refuse to pay. Some subscribe to a perception that they are unlikely to be caught and prose cuted, or if they are, will receive trivial penalties.\" </p> <p>However, householders are also to blame because they are dumping more rubbish. The Country Landowners' Association has reported an increased incidence, with one in four farmers saying rubbish has been tipped on their land in the last few years. </p> <p>The association's survey of members found that building rubble was the most common material dumped, followed by household items such as fridges, deep freezers, beds, sofas and mattresses. Household rubbish included dead pets, baths, soft toys, telephones, syringes and condoms. There are thought to be fewer cars being dumped now than a few years ago because of the high price of secondhand steel, due largely to China buying up the scrap. </p> <p>Sue Doughty, Liberal Demo crat environment spokeswoman, will warn today that the recent closure of most of Britain's hazardous waste plants - to comply with EU regulations - has left millions of tonnes of potentially dangerous waste with nowhere to go and could further fuel fly-tipping. </p> <p>\"It is scandalous that the government has had five years to prepare for the new rules under the 1999 landfill directive, but has failed to make sure that specialist facilities are ready in time,\" Ms Doughty said yesterday. </p> <p>\"The result could be devastating for regions of England and Wales, with a huge rise in illegal fly-tipping by cowboy waste contractors.\" </p> <p>The Environment Agency study urges action on a national level and suggests it should be made easier for contaminated waste to be disposed of legitimately. </p> <p>\"Reducing the availability of sites that can take contaminated waste makes it more difficult for waste carriers to behave legitimately, and enables fly-tippers to make excuses for their behaviour,\" it says. </p> <p>The Environment Agency says it has limited detective resources and no powers to stop vehicles or check identities. In London, for example, there were only 11 investigators dealing with more than 400 incidents of large-scale dumping in 2002. </p> <p>The fines for large-scale fly-tippers are minimal. Between 1999 and 2003 there were only 2,125 prosecutions, with fines averaging \u00a32,300. \"The fines given to construction and demolition waste offenders are considered to be quite insufficient to deter serious offenders, even if they were likely to be caught,\" says the report. </p> <p>\"There is a lot of waste to get rid of and there is every sign that it will increase,\" says an agency spokesman.</p>",
  "<p>MPs have given the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) a rap over the knuckles for not doing enough to ensure disabled employees and clients can use its IT systems. However, some disability campaigners defend the department, claiming it sets an example on how to cater for disabled people. </p> <p>A report from the Commons work and pensions committee on the department's management of IT projects says the department is \"in danger of failing to meet its duties under the Disability Discrimination Act and needs to look carefully at how it administers IT projects in the future\". The committee's report calls on the department to set out how it will \"ensure its IT projects are fully in line with the highest standards of accessibility and to provide reassurance it will fully meet its duties under the Disability Discrimination Act\". </p> <p>The criticism is embarrassing to the department because it is the sponsor of the act which, among other things, requires website owners to make reasonable adjustments to allow disabled people to use them. The DWP is adamant it has not broken its own law. \"The department has never knowingly breached the act or any other legislation,\" says a spokesperson. \"Our aim is for all our IT systems to be accessible to disabled users, but where this is not the case an alternative means of accessing the service is made available.\" </p> <p>The spokesperson adds that last year the department took significant steps to ensure the accessibility of its IT systems. \"These include the integration of accessibility into all the department's project management, governance and procurement processes; and the recent establishment of a set of IT accessibility standards - based on ISO technical specification 16071 - with which all new DWP systems must comply.\" </p> <p>An estimated 2,000 disabled people are employed in the DWP, but in many parts of the organisation it is not possible to work without computer access. Some Jobcentre posts, such as finance officer, are completely dependent on IT services. Without access to special systems, it is impossible for disabled people to do these jobs, and their career choices are limited. There are many ways of making systems accessible. IT staff can adjust displays, keyboards and mice on standard desktop systems to make them more usable. </p> <p>In addition, hundreds of specialised pieces of hardware and software are available to assist disabled people. For example, there are programs for blind people that turn text on screen into speech, alternatives to mice and keyboards that require minimal movement for use by physically disabled people, and telephones that convert speech into text for those with hearing difficulities. </p> <p>Experts insist that adaptations for disabled people are not expensive, although they can be difficult or impossible to implement on older systems. For example, Jobcentre Plus maintains a crucial system called the Labour Market System (LMS), which holds information on jobs, employers and employees. The system, which services 160 screens, is updated three times a year, and altering accessibility software in line with changes to the system is a big task. Each new version of LMS involves 15 days of scripting, testing and developing guidance for disabled users by the department's 10-strong accessibility solutions team based in Sheffield. </p> <p>In written evidence to the work and pensions committee, the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) was critical of the department. The institute quoted an example of a blind worker who had not been able to take up a job in the Pension Service because so-called legacy systems could not be adapted to run the screen readers that the person required. </p> <p>The charity emphasised the importance of specifying accessibility criteria in project design so that disabled staff and users can benefit from IT. The institute said: \"Most IT project managers, procurers, developers and contractors have little awareness of the importance of accessibility to software users, whether dis abled or not.\" </p> <p>However, when epublic contacted the RNIB it praised the department for setting a good example in many of its practices. \"It has established a specific service level for IT support for users of assistive technology throughout the department,\" says Ruth Loebl, senior UK ICT development officer at the RNIB. \"When a disabled member of staff telephones the IT help desk with a problem, providing they make it clear that they are an assistive technology user, the incident is automatically assigned a high priority. It is then passed to a dedicated team with one of the department's IT partner organisations and must be resolved within eight hours.\" </p> <p>Bill Fine a consultant with AbilityNet, an organisation that provides advice on IT for disabled employees, has briefed the department's managers on accessibility issues. \"There are many aspects of the way the department is addressing accessibility that are exemplary,\" he says. \"It has drawn up a list of recommended kit, employed specialist people in IT and written clear strategy and policy documents.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Lamb is consulting editor, Ability magazine</p>",
  "When Yinka Sunmonu mapped out her idea of setting up a website for the top 100 books by black authors, a friend told her she had never read one. The friend had read, and loved, The Color Purple, though. \"She didn't know the name Alice Walker, or that she was a black writer,\" says Sunmonu. <p>Now Sunmonu, an author herself, is setting out to change all that with Ebony Reads, a site offering the black equivalent of the BBC's The Big Read. \"This is a literary list,\" she says. \"I wanted to dispel some stereotypes about the black experience, so it isn't all about drugs, gun culture and single mothers.\"</p> <p>Visitors to the site will be invited to vote for their favourite books from the 100 on the site nominated by reading groups, libraries, publishers, bookshops and arts organisations. The list will be whittled down to 50 in December before the final 25 is announced in February.</p> <p>\"For years, I've had people come to me and ask where to find these books,\" says Sunmonu. \"There are still a lot of people who didn't know about black literature when they were growing up. Now I can tell them they don't have to scan the shelves any more because the information is here.\"</p> <p>The list features black writers from the UK, the US, Africa, South America and the Caribbean.

It's important for black children and young people to know what's out there, and to have access to material that is relevant.</p> <p>\"It's not a question of telling people they have to read everything on this list, but there is a hunger for this kind of knowledge. If people know that these books are available, they may just go and pick them up.\"</p> <p>The site also contains tips on creative writing and getting children reading - which Sunmonu believes can help raise academic achievement, confidence and motivation.</p> <p>Though the site is not officially launched until next month, it has already attracted huge interest. In the space of a week, Sunmonu has received at least 50 unsolicited emails recommending books, and at least 20 libraries have expressed an interest in promoting Ebony Reads.</p> <p>\"I'm amazed at the level of interest that it has generated, purely by word of mouth,\" says Sunmonu. \"Whatever happens, at least I know that I will have started a debate.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> Details at <a href=\"http://www.yinkasunmonu.com\">www.yinkasunmonu.com</a></p>",
  "The Office for National Statistics is trying to establish whether it is rising or falling in the UK. But, in west London, a resident-run housing association is claiming to be the first group to have measured \"social capital\" - the human relationships and networks that bind communities. <p>Walterton and Elgin Community Homes (Wech) has discovered that up to 15% of its residents are closely related to each other; that means parents and siblings living within 1km of each other. The majority were two related households, but one family had members living in five separate Wech homes.</p> <p>The theory goes that the more you are friendly with your neighbours, the stronger the informal support systems that may reduce crime, increase educational attainment and promote general wellbeing in a community. Proponents of social capital, however, are also accused of conservatism by harking back to a golden age when we lived in less mobile and diverse communities.</p> <p>Jonathan Rosenberg, Wech vice-chair, believes the organisation's decision to keep and, in some cases, bring communities back together - when it wrested control of 900 homes from Westminster council in 1992 - has been vindicated by the measurable creation of social capital.</p> <p>\"Having observed people's behaviour, it's a good thing to have households with close family ties on the estate,\" he says. \"I suspect it helps with free childcare, which allows our residents to go on training courses or out to work, and provides help with healthcare that would otherwise have to paid for by the state.\"</p> <p>But this is just a hunch, he concedes. Another survey is required to measure the impact.</p>",
  "<p>Local authorities have waited years for decent IT to alert them when children are in danger. Now several systems are coming all at once. </p> <p>Central government is sponsoring two initiatives for sharing data on children. Police forces are considering a separate system for identifying victims of abuse. All will rely on a link with health records, being developed by the NHS National Programme for IT, which in turn will connect to an electronic social care record. </p> <p>Meanwhile, basic data on every child in the land is likely to appear on two new databases: the Office for National Statistics' citizen information project and whatever database is created to support the national identity card. It is not yet clear how all these different systems will fit together. </p> <p>Last year's green paper, Every Child Matters, said the 150 or so \"top tier\" local authorities with responsibility for childcare should install IT to prevent a repetition of tragedies exemplified by the murder of Victoria Climbi\u00e9. However, authorities are still waiting for guidance on questions of technology and the legality of sharing data between agencies. A government-sponsored study of 135 authorities published last month reported that local authorities are \"confused by the conflicting guidance issued by different government departments\". </p> <p>The Children Bill, likely to become law late this autumn, may clarify the position. It will set a legal framework for sharing information between social workers, education authorities, the NHS and other agencies. And it will come none too soon for authorities already implementing systems. Two national initiatives are under way, sponsored by separate government departments. These are Information Sharing and Assessment (ISA) and Reducing Youth Offending Generic National Solution (Ryogens). </p> <p>The ISA initiative was set up by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) following the Climbi\u00e9 inquiry and Every Child Matters. ISA includes and supersedes systems known as identification, referral and tracking (IRT), which enable practitioners to share information about individual children. </p> <p>The idea is to build up a coherent narrative of concerns about a child, rather than a series of unrelated snapshots. For example, a teacher with concerns about a child would use IRT to find out whether other agencies are involved and identify a lead professional whom they could contact. </p> <p>One pioneering example of IRT is the Aware system at Telford and Wrekin, Shropshire. Aware is one of 10 \"trailblazer\" projects funded with \u00a31m each to develop and test new ways of information sharing and multi-agency working. </p> <p>Although the DfES describes IRT as a \"building block\" for its vision of shared information and assessment, no detailed specification has yet emerged of what the building block should look like. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the DfES has awarded 135 local authorities that are not trailblazers \u00a3100,000 each for \"early work on the professional practice aspects of information sharing\". An evaluation of these authorities' progress published last month found 69% were on course to meet requirements set out in the green paper. </p> <p>The main difficulty in authorities was the size and complexity of the task. \"Project managers had to negotiate a labyrinth of agencies, organisations, personnel and cultures and believe that, although they have the skills and commitment to do the job, they sometimes lacked the necessary resources and support,\" the report said. </p> <p>The main external difficulty remains uncertainty about the legality of sharing information between agencies. \"Project managers were unclear about the relatively untested legal position and confused by the conflicting guidance issued by different government departments,\" the report noted. </p> <p>In parallel with the work on ISA is a separate initiative, sponsored by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM). Ryogens is an off-the-shelf IT system for sharing information about children and young adults at risk of falling into crime. The system works along similar principles to IRT: it receives alerts from different agencies concerned with an individual child to give early warning of trouble. Anyone entering information has to confirm it is being done legally, which means with the subject's consent or in accordance with a specific protocol. </p> <p>When the number of warnings reaches a threshold - set by the local authority - the system alerts a lead practitioner. Ryogens has been piloted at Warwickshire and at Tower Hamlets in London as one of the ODPM's 23 \"national projects\" to develop e-government technology. A sister project, Fame is working on a framework of rules for information sharing. </p> <p>Ryogens' second pilot phase begins next month. This will be based on a second version of the Ryogens software. One new feature is email alerting to help occasional users. </p> <p>\"Many practitioners won't use Ryogens every day, so they may miss a piece of relevant information,\" says Denbigh Cowley of the Ryogens national project. The new system will send them an email asking them to log in and take a look. \"If they have raised a concern, they would be informed that something has happened.\" Cowley stresses that emails will not contain sensitive information. </p> <p>Ryogens software is available now for a \u00a325,000 one-off cost, covering an unlimited number of users. </p> <p>While Cowley says Ryogens \"complements the Isa agenda\", he adds that it should not be seen as a replacement for a database of all children. \"Ryogens is about the children who are most vulnerable.\" </p> <p>However, Stephen Howes, a principal at Socitm Consulting, says Ryogens could help authorities along the way to Isa. \"It can be implemented fairly simply. It will have some sort of repository where information can be shared on a more detailed basis, subject to rules.\" </p> <p>Guy Mallison of consultants RSe says the two projects are beginning to come together. and that Isa now features in the priority service outcomes set by the ODPM for local e-government. </p> <p>Local authority managers concerned with data about children need to keep an eye on two developments outside their patch: several police forces are creating their own databases of child abuse and the NHS is creating a national system of electronic health records, which will include information relevant to social care. Traditionally, the police and NHS have been protective of their data, especially about sharing it with local authorities. </p> <p>This will have to change if the government's agenda is to become reality. Howes says the responsibility will fall on councils: \"Isa is very much an emphasis on local government leadership.\" </p> <p>Exercising such leadership, however, will be difficult until central government clarifies what it is doing with its various databases of children, sub-sets of children and of the general population. One idea ministers are considering is a central source of information about all 11 million children in Britain. This would be presented as a \"hub\", rather than a database with its \"big brother\" connotations. </p> <p>Many details need to be resolved, not least the link to proposed national population databases. One outstanding issue is the identity number to be used for children. Several pilots have used the 10-digit NHS identifier, the most up-to-date available. Yet this goes against NHS policy, which is that local authorities' departments may use the number but only for the purposes of NHS care. </p> <p>The consensus is that authorities should not rush into installing systems until central government decides on an architecture for sharing data about children. This should not, however, be an excuse for ignoring the agenda, says Mallison. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Reducing Youth Offending Generic National solution</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ryogens.org.uk\">ryogens.org.uk</a> for Education and Skills: <a href=\"http://www.dfes.gov.uk\">dfes.gov.uk</a> </p> <p><strong>Identification, referral and tracking</strong> <a href=\"http://www.cypu.gov.uk/\">cypu.gov.uk/</a> </p> <p><strong>Framework for Multi-agency Environments</strong> <a href=\"http://www.fame-uk.org\">fame-uk.org</a></p>",
  "<p>City and County of Swansea: <a href=\"http://www.swansea.gov.uk\">swansea.gov.uk</a> IT department strikers: <a href=\"http://www.swansea-ict.org.uk\">swansea-ict.org.uk</a> </p> <p>Swansea city council's IT staff went on strike in mid-August in protest at what they say are plans to outsource their jobs. By last week, the dispute was widening, with other staff being balloted over taking action in support. The council called in arbitrators to resolve an increasingly bitter dispute. </p> <p>The strike is the first in Britain specifically over e-government. Swansea has announced a vision to transform the way it delivers services through an ambitious project, service@swansea, which will create joined-up service centres providing a single point for all enquiries. When it goes live, people will be able to access services face to face, over the telephone and via the internet. To create this vision, the council says private sector expertise is essential. </p> <p>Similar e-services are being developed by local councils across the UK. Hundreds of council IT staff have already been outsourced to the private sector in similar deals to deliver similar projects to meet the 2005 e-deadline. </p> <p>So why the fuss? And why are events in the IT department - normally ignored by those delivering essential services on the frontline unless their computer systems go down - causing such a stir in all sections of the council? </p> <p>The IT staff say they found out that the council was considering transferring them to a private company only when they saw an advert requesting tenders for the contract. About 100 walked out. </p> <p>The strikers are frustrated by \"management's insistence that we are against the service@swansea project\". They insist they welcome the changes the project will bring \"but not at the cost of having our jobs sold to the highest bidder to part-pay for the entire project\". </p> <p>\"If the council just talked to us, informally even, about having talks about this procurement, that in itself would very likely get our members back into work,\" says Jeff Baker, Unison organiser at Swansea. </p> <p>The council says it \"fully suports\" service@swansea and that no decision has been made about who will run the project. </p> <p>Developments at Swansea come against a background of a series of problems with outsourcing of e-government initiatives. Earlier this year a strike threat forced Bradford city council to backtrack on plans to outsource IT staff as part of its e-government project, and agree instead for staff to be seconded to the pri vate firm running the IT service. This secondment model is the Swansea strikers' preferred option. However they say the council will not consider this idea. </p> <p>Meanwhile, one of the companies in talks about the contract, ITNET, is providing \"strike-breaking\" cover to support IT systems during the dispute. According to a website set up by the strikers, several IT systems have been affected despite the cover. </p> <p>The dispute highlights the threat to IT jobs across Britain as councils implement efficiency targets. \"Staff are obviously very concerned and see the proposals as a threat,\" says Chris Guest, president of the Society of Information Technology Management (Socitm) and head of IT at Flintshire county council. \"The Gershon [efficiency] review has switched the emphasis of e-government somewhat from improved public service to efficiency gains and this may have heightened concern among staff.\" </p> <p>According to Baker, there are worries about the economic viability of the service@swansea plan, \"which could end up costing many back-office council jobs beyond IT\". Business process re-engineering (BPR) is a big element of the project. With ongoing costs of around \u00a33.5m a year, the council expects to be making \u00a33.8m a year in savings from the implementation by 2008. </p> <p>\"We would suggest that BPR is a euphemism for job losses because it identifies savings as a result of the introduction of the new technology - in terms of customer contact services and in terms of back office support, in payroll, personnel and finance,\" argues Baker. </p> <p>The council intends to reinvest savings in frontline services and redeploy staff. But can admin staff really become social workers or refuse collectors delivering frontline services? And surely only so many people are needed to front customer call-in centres. </p> <p>While Guest does not see job losses as an inevitable result of e-government, he admits that changes in the way local government works, collaboration and joined-up services could have an impact on employee numbers. \"Sustainability is an issue for most councils. And Socitm has recognised that its members will require ongoing support with their e-government programmes and assistance in securing funding at a local and national level.\" </p> <p>Local e-government services will have to be self-financing by March 2006 when government funding runs out. Obviously, councils hope that by implementing slick new systems they will achieve efficiency savings while improving frontline service delivery. </p> <p>However, few councils have underpinned their e-government programmes with a business case aimed at self-sufficiency. Instead, encouraged by government funding and targets, many have bolted e-services on top of existing infrastructures. Until now, this has been a free ride. The fear is that when e-services have to pay their way, new ways of working could lead many staff to the dole queue.</p>",
  "<p>For a man with multiple death threats hanging over him, Peter Tatchell is remarkably composed. Not that he shares this view. \"I look completely exhausted; I probably wouldn't take a great picture,\" he says on the phone a few hours before we meet. Tatchell, social activist extraordinaire, has been working seven days a week on his latest campaign, against homophobic lyrics in reggae music, itself part of a long-running protest at discrimination against gay men and lesbians in Jamaica. </p> <p>Typically, the campaign has irked some liberal commentators. Tatchell has been derided for his ignorance of Jamaican culture and called a racist for demanding that two Jamaican reggae artists were banned from the Music of Black Origin Awards (Mobos). He shrugs. \"We've focused on eight artists who have released songs that have variously called for gay people to be shot, burned, stabbed, drowned and hung. These are incitements to murder, which is a criminal offence.\" </p> <p>Tatchell bombarded the Mobos with letters and emails, and implored the BBC not to broadcast the event. He led street demonstrations against what he has termed \"murder music\". The tactics finally bore fruit two weeks ago when Elephant Man and Vybx Kartel were dropped by the Mobos after they refused to apologise for homophobic lyrics. Elsewhere, he has pestered nightclubs and reggae festivals with requests to ban artists, with varying degrees of success. Some gigs have been cancelled. </p> <p>He accuses the liberal left and governments (both Jamaican and British) of failing to condemn hate lyrics or to come to the assistance of persecuted gay Jamaicans. This, he claims, is endorsing homophobia and is a \"benign form of racism\". </p> <p>The backlash has been vociferous. Instead of enjoying his Mobos victory, he is facing allegations both of racism and \"cultural imperialism\". He is \"stunned and hurt\" by some of the reactions - particularly from the black press. \"It is utterly bizarre,\" he says. \"I expected some opposition, but not the ill-founded accusations of racism. They have been emotionally devastating.\" </p> <p>He is visibly despondent. Being an oppressed minority is no excuse for oppressing another minority group, he says. He gains strength from the support of black gay rights groups, which have rallied to his side. All anyone has to do, Tatchell insists, is to look at his record of defending black people against racism, such as his campaigns against apartheid and, more recently, attempts to highlight human rights abuses by Robert Mugabe. (Tatchell says he was left brain damaged after being beaten by the Zimbabwean leader's henchmen when he confronted Mugabe on the steps of a hotel in Brussels last year). \"In 1983, neo-Nazis accused me of being an 'N'-lover because I stood up and defended the black community against white racists, and yet here we are 20 years later ... \" </p> <p>He sounds exasperated, but he's like a dog with a bone. \"The police uncovered a plot in 1995 by the neo-Nazi group Combat 18 to kill me because they hated the fact that I was defending black and gay people. And now I'm getting threats from some black people because I'm defending gay Jamaicans. I can't win.\" </p> <p>The threats are serious, he says. \"The Metropolitan Police have advised me there is a possibility that I may be killed. Some of the people we are targeting have connections with gangsters.\" So how afraid is he? \"It's sort of par for the course, y'know?\" He suddenly looks weary. His eyes lower for the only time in the interview. He admits to keeping a fire extinguisher by his bedside in his south London council flat in case of hate attacks. </p> <p>For almost four decades, Tatchell has been campaigning on controversial issues. While primarily concentrating on gay rights issues such as the age of consent, he has also brought his particular brand of activist politics to topics such as Aids and capital punishment. Current campaigns include defending the rights of gay Palestinians to seek asylum in Israel, and challenging the introduction of repressive antigay legislation in Russia. </p> <p>Born in Melbourne in 1952, Tatchell began campaigning in his teens, railing against the death penalty, the war in Vietnam and the treatment of Aborigines. After moving to the UK in 1971, he began a long struggle for gay and human rights, first with the Gay Liberation Front and eventually with the radical gay rights group OutRage!, which he co-founded in 1990. </p> <p>There have been two unsuccessful forays into mainstream politics - one as the Labour party's candidate in the Bermondsey by-election of 1983, in which he was demonised by the tabloid press for his homosexuality, and, almost two decades later, standing as an independent for the London Assembly. </p> <p>You wonder, however, if he has not achieved more outside mainstream politics. His methods have consistently provoked strong reactions, often being described as over the top and unnecessary. He once threw himself on former prime minister John Major's car, and in 1994 he outed 10 Church of England bishops - justified, he says, because they were \"colluding with homophobic policies\". Within a month, the church had issued its strongest condemnation of anti-gay discrimination and opened talks with lesbian and gay groups. </p> <p>Tatchell has been vilified from all sides of the political spectrum, variously described as an \"extremist\", an \"exhibitionist\", a \"homosexual terrorist\", a \"nigger lover\" and, now, as a \"racist\". Why does he continue in the face of such relentless assaults? \"Maybe I've got an over-developed conscience,\" he says, self-mockingly. \"I believe I am right. I focus on the issues that most other people are neglecting. I suppose I think: 'That could be me or a member of my family.'\" </p> <p>Tatchell recoils at the idea of taking credit for his achievements. \"That would be egotistic.\" He says he is \"unexceptional\" and \"only one of millions of people\" who feel the need to take action in the form of direct protest. </p> <p>An hour into the interview (most of which takes place outside the loos in a cavernous underground nightclub in Leicester Square), Tatchell is in full flow, his weariness evaporating. I ask if he is an angry person. \"Anger doesn't drive me; it's love and empathy with other human beings. I get upset. I internalise it.\" There's a long, loose laugh. </p> <p>Hasn't he ever just wanted to give up? \"Lots of times.\" He talks of his \"many sacrifices\" and says the absence of a loving relationship is among the most difficult. His meagre existence is another. During the course of our meeting, he refers to the fact that he has never had much money and that, unlike other gay rights groups - notably the pressure group, Stonewall - his has \"limited resources, no staff and no formal funding\". </p> <p>He is reluctant to admit it, but his health concerns now cast a long shadow over his work. \"The doctor told me after the Mugabe incident that I wouldn't be able to campaign in the same way. But I still try.\" </p> <p>He worries that the left, and New Labour, are letting down the marginalised people they should be defending, and that he despairs of some trends in the gay community. Most gay and lesbian MPs have been a \"big let down\", he sighs, adding: \"The commercialisation of gay culture is rather sad. Too many gay people have gone along with a set of values that judge people by their style and material possessions rather than their character.\" </p> <p>Has he any regrets? \"No.\" Not even regarding outing people? \"No.\" </p> <p>So after the Mobos, what does the future hold? He confesses to being so fatigued he has at times hallucinated, but insists there are other battles to be fought. \"I will continue to fight on behalf of persecuted Jamaicans. And there are other campaigns, just waiting to be taken off the shelf.\" </p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong> Age</strong> 52 </p> <p><strong> Status</strong> Single </p> <p><strong> Education</strong> Mount Waverly high school, Melbourne, Australia.

  "<p>Public bodies earning income by selling services online have been warned to expect tough scrutiny to protect competition. The Office of Fair Trading has announced its intention to study the market in land information services, following an investigation which ended last month. </p> <p>The Guardian understands this investigation has covered the whole emerging market in e-government products. The office's chairman, John Vickers, warned last week that \"publicly owned producers engaged in economic activity are subject to competition law, just as private firms are\". </p> <p>He was speaking after the OFT cleared arrangements under which property information is sold through the National Land Information Service (NLIS). The service provides a single point of contact for official land and property-related information in England and Wales, allowing property searches to be done online. </p> <p>The service's \"hub\", set up by the Local Government Information House, is run by a private contractor, MacDonald Dettwiler. The company is also one of three firms with licences to sell information from the hub to conveyancers. </p> <p>A rival licensee of an NLIS channel, TM Property Services, complained that the arrangement allowed MacDonald Dettwiler to abuse \"a dominant position as the sole information hub operator\". The OFT ruled last month that there were no grounds for action but said \"the market as a whole needs further in-depth study, which will be conducted by the OFT in due course\". </p> <p>Steven Foster, TM's chief executive, welcomed the decision to investigate further. \"We expect the Local Government Information House (the NLIS regulator) to fulfil its contractual obligations to provide a fair, viable and competitive NLIS environment.\" </p> <p>The OFT's probe is likely to raise wider questions about the way government creates markets in e-services. In theory, it is policy to encourage commercial \"intermediaries\" to offer services based on government data. </p> <p>However, such businesses have been slow to take off because there is nothing to stop public bodies launching their own services in competition.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Helen Jerry, head of employment law at Shaw Pittman LLP, London</strong></p> <p><strong>IT staff have gone on strike at Swansea city council in a dispute over outsourcing plans. My authority is lso thinking about outsourcing. How can we avoid trouble?</strong><br>The key to the dispute, as argued by Unison, is the council's failure to look at the other options besides outsourcing. </p> <p>This is notwithstanding Swansea city's August press release saying no final decision had been made and it would ensure staff had enhanced protection for their terms and conditions if they did transfer across. This is more than most staff affected by Tupe (transfer of undertakings protection of employment) can hope for. Unison also alleges the council has failed to consult representatives properly. </p> <p>Yet, in its press statement, the council explained its managers had met staff over many months to try to allay their concerns and met trade union representatives every fortnight. </p> <p>Tupe says the council must seek the union's agreement to measures which affect staff; it does not say agreement must be obtained. This may be why there is still a strike. The central issue seems to be whether the council's intention in consulting with the union was to seek its agreement or simply to be seen to jump through the legal hoops. </p> <p>So how can industrial disputes be avoided in the face of lawful staff transfers? Communication is key. If 97% of Unison members voted to strike, the council's message - that this is an opportunity for staff - did not get across. Staff communication is not the same as the statutory duty to consult representatives. Communication needs transparency, which employers find uncomfortable but which promotes employee buy-in. </p> <p>By law, employees transfer on their existing terms and conditions. There is no right to change these, so consultation must be undertaken with the aim of reaching agreement. Nobody likes to be consulted about a done deal. Patience and openness are essential if the new provider cannot realistically replicate terms. Without all the facts it is impossible to know where - if anywhere - Swansea city fell short. But as adverse publicity around outsourcing, and fear of offshoring, increases, employers must face the challenge of talking to an increasingly enlightened, and potentially militant, workforce about what it is doing and why. </p> <p><strong>Paul Tonks public services director, Civica </strong></p> <p><strong>What IT do I need to keep up with the StreetScene initiative? </strong><br>A StreetScene requires cohesive management of everything we feel, touch, hear and see on the street in order to improve citizens' quality of life. Authorities must therefore take an integrated approach to make it work.StreetScene relies on specialist partnerships between councils, citizens and external suppliers. </p> <p>These require a framework, where key managers and personnel are encouraged, educated and invested in, and all commit to performance improvement goals. The partnership should also keep abreast of the impact of current and best practice, and departments must collaborate to share best practice. Promotion of quality, up-todate management information is also essential - it will reduce the burden of data collection on StreetScene managers, allowing them to take action in real time and make informed decisions. </p> <p>StreetScene has several core elements of technology. Integrated software applications - for example, traffic and environmental management - automate much of the intensive processing. Management reporting tools analyse performance of StreetScene initiatives helping to meet goals and objectives and drive senior staff members and ultimately citizens to buy in. Mobile technology, from digital cameras to GPS satellite tracking, enables personnel on the street to be linked to the back office in real time. </p> <p>Integration ensures processes are completed effectively. Finally, third party-managed services help authorities reduce costs and share the risk of street management. </p> <p><strong>Stephen Cirell head of Eversheds' local government group</strong></p> <p><strong>My organisation, which is a public authority under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, is preparing for its implementation on January 1 2005. How can we use IT to ease the process, and what are the pitfalls? </strong><br>From January 1 2005, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 gives the public a statutory right to information held by public authorities, subject to certain exemptions. </p> <p>In practice, this means that from January, anyone - private individuals or companies - can submit formal requests for information held by more than 100,000 public bodies, from local authorities and government departments to police authorities, schools, colleges, universities and NHS bodies such as hospital trusts. </p> <p>The public authority must respond within 20 working days of receiving the request - or receiving the fee if one is charged - and the information must be provided to the applicant unless one of the statutory exemptions applies.</p> <p>One use of IT could be to ease the prompt dissemination of information in various ways, such as having a page dedicated to the act on your website. One of the act's requirements is that public authorities maintain a publication scheme detailing information routinely available from the authority.</p> <p>Ensuring your publication scheme is on your website, with links to information where possible, may reduce the amount of paper requests you receive. An automatic \"request for information\" form could form part of this page. Requests under the act do not need to specify that they are made under the act, but they do need to be in writing - which will include electronic mail. </p> <p>Using such a form may also assist in monitoring requests for information. If it comes to light that your organisation is receiving a large number of requests for information which is not part of your publication scheme, include it in the scheme if possible and publish it on your website.</p> <p>Other ways IT could assist with the act include improving records management, calculating the costs of dealing with requests, monitoring complaints and appeals, detecting vexatious or repeat requests and recording the transfer of requests to other authorities. An intranet could be used to post staff guidance and advertise training courses.</p> <p>As the amount of information stored electronically increases, IT security is paramount, so ensure staff are aware of security issues. As frontline staff get used to the new presumption of disclosure under the act, there is a danger they may get complacent about the information they make available. </p> <p>It is important to ensure information that is, for example, truly confidential or commercially sensitive is secure by limiting access to documents. But remember that IT should be used to facilitate the disclosure of information, not hinder it. </p> <p>The Department for Constitutional Affairs has produced a paper on generic user requirements for IT systems to manage requests under the act (and requests for environmental information), which may be a helpful starting point to procuring a system that meets the act's requirements. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Weblinks</strong> Government portal giving details of public services <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk\">direct.gov.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Cabinet Office</strong> <a href=\"http://www.cabinet-office.gov.uk\">cabinet-office.gov.uk</a></p> <p><strong>News and information</strong> for local e-government <a href=\"http://www.UKauthorITy.com\">UKauthorITy.com</a> </p> <p><strong>It can be found at </strong> <a href=\"http://www.foi.gov.uk/map/gus_v4_complete.pdf\">foi.gov.uk/map/gus_v4_complete.pdf</a>.</p> <p>Email your questions to epublic's editor at <a href=\"mailto:richard.doughty@theguardian.com\">richard.doughty@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Roll up, roll up. For the puny sum of \u00a31,750, you can spend a day in the company of giants. At Earls Court next month, the Leaders in London event is taking place, to be addressed by the likes of former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, Alvin (Future Shock) Toffler, and Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric. <p>The jamboree will (according to Digby Jones, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry) inspire you. Giuliani will \"advise you how to straighten out even 'ungovernable' situations and lead your people through unforeseeable crises\". Robert S Kaplan, the Harvard Business School professor, will \"reveal how to apply his sensational new way to visualise, communicate and deploy strategy across your organisation\".</p> <p>Very American business school, you might say - and if Kaplan is that good, why isn't he coining it in himself instead of lecturing about business? On the tradition of \"boosterism\" captured in Babbitt and Elmer Gantry and other novels by Sinclair Lewis, business prophets such as Tom Peters (In Search of Excellence) have built a profitable business. It's also very private sector. Company managers, it seems, have pots to spend on snake oil.</p> <p>But gurus play big in the public sector, too. Edward de Bono, the prophet of \"lateral thinking\", has enjoyed a renaissance under New Labour. He has done turns in Whitehall, for the former Department of Education and Employment, for the East of England regional development agency, and now is running sessions with NHS managers, with the encouragement of Sir Nigel Crisp, the NHS chief executive.</p> <p>Compared with local government, the NHS deploys a huge budget for training and managerial development, and De Bono's training company, the Holst group, has been retained to run one-day seminars this autumn, featuring its patented \"six-hats\" method\", at \u00a3400 per participant. According to De Bono, his approach \"is the first new way of thinking to be developed for 2,400 years, since the days of Plato, Socrates and Aristotle\". By successively putting on six different coloured pieces of head gear, participants will \"look at problems from different perspectives\".</p> <p>Stewart Scott, a De Bono trainer, told the Observer the method could help \"everyone, from Sir Nigel himself down to the man who looks after the morgue. [It] gives you life skills which are particularly applicable to the NHS because it faces a lot of challenges.\"</p> <p>Maybe Crisp was impressed by such De Bono maxims as \"once thought, an idea can not be unthought\". But he does not seem to have inquired of his colleague David Normington, permanent secretary at education, whether the deployment of the multihued hats improved policy making or imple mentation in schools. One of the problems with gurus is that - for all that this is the age of targets and measurement - it is impossible to put numbers on what they do or claim.</p> <p>What distinguishes them is a certain breathless self-confidence. You can hear it in the adverts for sessions run by a home-grown mini guru such as John Seddon, who asserts (on the basis of some ropey and anachronistic theory) that council workers should be like Japanese car workers.</p> <p>The University of Warwick, staid and respectable, is a temporary home to Mark Moore, the prophet of \"public value\". This is a harmless enough doctrine urging public managers to take more pride in their work, but it is curious for having evolved in the US at the same time as the Republicans - who are pretty antagonistic both to government and the public sector - are in control of the White House and Congress.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest problem with gurus and events extolling leadership is that when people are having transformational visions at the top of the office, the staff down below are left to get on with it. Nigel Edwards, policy director of the NHS Confederation, notes that large numbers of NHS staff were unaware that the Tories floated a raft of great changes - GP fundholding and all - in the early 1990s; and they were unaware, too, that the reforms were rescinded after Labour came to power in 1997.</p> <p>At the Guardian's recent forum on leadership, Michael O'Higgins, of consultants Hay, observed that all leadership is \"situational\", meaning there are strict limits to how far you can generalise about the qualities needed by top people. Take Giuliani. Before the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, he was deeply unpopular in many parts of New York. Barbara Kellerman, author of the book Bad Leadership, notes that if the terrorist attack had not happened, Giuliani would never have been able to peddle his wares as a leadership guru.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> David Walker is editor of Public, the Guardian's new monthly magazine for public service executives.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> To subscribe to Public magazine go to <a href=\"mailto:publicsubs@theguardian.com\">publicsubs@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Getting children into their school of choice in London can be a slow and painful process. But at least the process of choosing secondary schools may soon get easier, thanks to a project involving 41 councils in and around the capital. </p> <p>Some 20-25% of children in London attend a secondary school outside their home borough. Yet each borough processes its intake without regard to the others. Parents applying to more than one borough may receive multiple offers, generating an apparent shortage of places until duplicate offers are turned down. </p> <p>This scenario is supposed to improve in September next year when the Education Act 2002 requires each local education authority to offer just one place per pupil. </p> <p>But London's 33 boroughs, which each run their own authority, plus the eight council LEAs that surround the capital, are going one better: they have voluntarily opted to coordinate their admission systems so that all 41 offer next year's intake just one place per pupil, allowing them to make more offers overall. </p> <p>\"The idea is that parents make one application through their home borough and get one offer through their home borough, regardless of whether it is in the borough,\" says Graham Carter, head of admissions for the London borough of Wandsworth. </p> <p>\"There have been a lot of multiple offers made to parents which they have sometimes sat on for a long time. One person's multiple offer is another person's no-offer.\" </p> <p>Last year, for example, Wandsworth received 3,500 applications for 2,000 secondary school starting places. </p> <p>Coordination will take place through the London Schools Admission System, under the School Admissions national project, which is funded by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister with a grant of \u00a31.5m for its work to next March. </p> <p>Parents of pupils transferring to secondary education in 2005 have a single paper form from their council, covering applications to all 41 authorities. They have until October 22 to choose up to six schools in order of preference. </p> <p>For future years, Hertfordshire county council is working on allowing parents to enter preferences online. This year, however, parents' choices will be typed or scanned in by their home authorities. </p> <p>Of the 41 councils, 40 use one of three software suppliers for schools admissions - Arete, Foundation and Capita - while Hertfordshire uses in-house software. All four packages have been adjusted to exchange data securely through the Pan London Register, which will operate across the capital's educational network, the London Grid for Learning, using software developed by Arete. </p> <p>In mid-November the education authorities will swap information on pupils applying outside their home borough or council, using data standards established by the Department for Education and Skills. They - and schools in each borough that control their own admissions - will then decide on whom to offer places to, with acceptance criteria unchanged by the new system. These offers must be passed back through the system to home LEAs by February 9. </p> <p>Then comes the difficult part: each council's software will, on behalf of each of its home pupils, accept the offer that was highest-placed by their parents, and release the rest through the system. This will open up more places, allowing some pupils to get into schools higher on their lists, opening up yet more places. </p> <p>The project plans to run this computerised cycle up to 20 times. \"Twenty is about what we've got time for,\" says programme manager Carl Flaxman. \"We need to stop on February 22 to give councils enough time to send letters to parents by March 1 [the deadline for offers]. The alternative would be a manual, unstructured process with two or three [repeats].\"</p> <p>The project should slow, rather than stop, the multipleoffer merry-go-round. It does not include private schools and city technology colleges, which have decided not to take part. However, a July report from the House of Commons education and skills committee said ministers should force these colleges to cooperate for the 2006 entry. </p> <p>Getting the councils to work together has been challenging, says Flaxman. \"Each of the 41 has a different infrastructure. Many have been outsourced, so there are communication issues between the project and the people doing this work. </p> <p>\"They have their own views on security, and we have had to make sure our security is acceptable by the majority of authorities.\" Carter says the London Inter-Authority Admission Group of the capital's admissions officers, which he established, helped build consensus. The education and skills committee report said the project has \"an exciting and ambitious goal\", pointing out that London's distribution of schools is often unsuited to individual boroughs, as many were established before boroughs took control of education.</p> <p>However, it expressed concern about the complexity of the project and the clarity of lines of political and administrative accountability. If all goes well next spring, the work done in London can be reused elsewhere through the national project. \"We'll be publishing the schemas and our experiences,\" says Carter. \"It certainly would be useful in other urban areas.\"</p>",
  "<p>Anne Owers, the chief inspector of prisons, last week published positive reports on the therapeutic community (TC) care given to inmates at Grendon Underwood jail, near Aylesbury, and Dovegate prison in Staffordshire. The reports provide an insight into an aspect of penal life that usually receives little attention outside the prison world, and serve as a reminder that prejudice can still prevent good practice from being as widely embraced as it should be. </p> <p>The inspectors were unstinting in their praise of Grendon, a state-run prison. It opened in 1962, holds around 200 inmates, and takes some of the most damaged and damaging prisoners. More than half are murderers; all have been convicted of crimes \"against the person\". Grendon met - and, in some areas, exceeded - the inspectors' criteria for a \"healthy prison\". Owers said that to achieve this with such a distinctive inmate profile, with such a high proportion of so-called psychopaths, was an enormous achievement. </p> <p>The TC unit at Dovegate, run by the Premier Prison Group, operates as part of the main, category B prison. It opened two years ago, and also holds around 200 inmates. The inspectors note that it is too soon to say whether the unit will emulate Grendon's longevity, but their report makes clear that the newcomer is on the way to achieving the excellent standards set by its pioneering counterpart. </p> <p>Both units boast impressive statistics that normal jails would envy: low incidence of self-harm, assaults and offences against discipline (astonishingly, for a category B prison, Grendon has no segregation unit). </p> <p>Common sense ought to dictate that prisoners who are treated better will behave better. But these units do more than operate decent regimes. All the information available on what happens to prisoners who experience therapeutic care indicates strongly that it works. Research shows a remarkable decrease in reoffending rates for Grendon prisoners. A 1993 study revealed reconviction rates of 19%, compared with the then adult rate - across the board - of 56%. All further studies indicate a 20-25% decrease in the reoffending pattern of those who have undergone the Grendon experiment. </p> <p>Given these figures, it ought to come as a shock to hear the inspectors say that Grendon appears to be undervalued within the prison system. But the prison has always been under siege from reactionary elements of the penal system. The regime, like that at Dovegate, is democratically based: prisoners elect other prisoners to lead group therapy sessions, where they challenge each other on their past behaviour. </p> <p>The idea of prisoners having such a level of control over their own lives is, of course, seen as heresy in the eyes of the Old Guard. They see Grendon and Dovegate as being a soft touch, a million miles away from the \"lock 'em up and count 'em\" mantra, which, they believe, has served the system well thus far (appalling reoffending rates are conveniently ignored). </p> <p>The reality, however, is different. I have never undergone therapy in prison, but I have seen, first hand, the harrowing effect that such treatment has had on fellow prisoners. In the 1990s, I was in jail on a wing experimenting with mixing vulnerable prisoners (VPs), usually sex offenders, with \"normal\" criminals. The jail operated a sex offenders treatment programme, which involved intensive group therapy. </p> <p>It soon became apparent that many of the VPs found these sessions harrowing. One told me why. If a prisoner tried to minimise his offence in the eyes of the group, the rest would round on him until he admitted that he - and not his victim(s) - had instigated the offence (it is common for sex offenders, even when their crimes have been against children, to claim that the victim had \"led them on\"). </p> <p>One day, a VP I had got to know approached me. He wanted the name of a good solicitor, as he wished to admit to further offences. I told him he would almost certainly get extra time and that he should sleep on the decision. But he was adamant. \"Because of therapy, for the first time, I realise fully the terrible harm I've done,\" he said. \"I can't think about a new life until the slate is clean.\" </p> <p>He went to court and received three years on top of the substantial sentence he was serving. The judge told him he would have got a lot more had he not admitted offences that otherwise would not have come to light. That man is the only VP that I kept in touch with after my release. He says he has not offended since. I believe him. </p> <p>Grendon's inspection report begs some serious questions: why doesn't the prison service embrace a system that, while not perfect, clearly works better than conventional imprisonment? Why has it taken 40 years to put another Grendon on line? Why is it that, after a 1993 Prison Service study showed that at least 2,500 prisoners would benefit from therapy, there are fewer than 500 therapeutic community places in the whole system? </p> <p>Perhaps those who oversee the prison system would benefit from a little therapy. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Eric Allison is the Guardian's prisons correspondent.</p>",
  "<p>I count myself lucky enough to be able to pay my taxes. I vote regularly, despite what's sometimes on offer, and I'm an active citizen. I enjoy my job, truly love life, and have lots to be thankful for. Yet much of the time I feel like a grown up Jimmy Porter, the original \"angry young man\" of playwright John Osborne's theatrical invention. This is because I use a wheelchair, and overcoming a multitude of obstacles has been par for the course. </p> <p>In life, it's the little things that make the big differences. But Britain, as far as disability is concerned, does not encourage spontaneity. So my life's frustrations include not being able to meander into high street shops to buy something on a whim, hop on a train without booking 24 hours in advance, accept a dinner invitation without scouting ahead and, on one occasion, missing a major local government conference because ScotAir refused to let me board. Everywhere I go, I have first to dip my toe - or even my wheelchair - into the water. </p> <p>In principle at least, my lifetime of being treated as a second-class citizen will change from October 1, when the final phase of the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) kicks in, heralding, we hope, a new era of civil rights. The law states that organisations providing a service to the public have to make improvements to their buildings and operations so that no disabled person is prevented from using them. (A recent Disability Rights Commission poll highlights that 70% of disabled people are prevented from accessing a service.) </p> <p>A wide range of services is covered by the DDA. It could be the local library, shop, town hall, post office or doctors' surgery. From next month, if a physical feature is making it impossible or really difficult for disabled people to use a service, then the organisation will have to think about providing the service in a different way. A solicitor's office on the second floor of a building with no lift could consider - for no extra charge - providing a home visit for a disabled client who couldn't get to the office. A small shop might have to make sure its aisles are easy to navigate - useful for parents with prams, incidentally, as well as those using wheelchairs or crutches. </p> <p>The past few months have seen a number of \"scare stories\" about these legal changes. The myth that the DDA will place a financial burden on business implodes when one observes the benefits to business of similar \"reasonable adjustments\" legislation in America. The US has realised the advantages of opening up its businesses to disabled consumers - yet the British \"disabled pound\" remains largely untapped. Improving facilities should not mean closure for village halls and local heritage sites. Many have made the changes and are very much in business. </p> <p>Where there are complaints, most cases can be resolved through conciliation, but disabled people now have new rights and the DRC will help to enforce them. </p> <p>This is not the final word. At the heart of a draft disability bill, currently being considered by parliament, is the creation of a statutory duty on all public bodies not just to tackle individual acts of discrimination, but to take action to root out institutional barriers of policy and practice. Modelled on the Race Relations (Amendment) Act, it will mean that individual disabled people no longer have to complain their way to equality only to get a poor excuse for justice, long after the event. </p> <p>It is hard to overstate just how big a deal this is for disabled people, who may, for instance, still be refused health treatment because of ignorant, subjective assumptions about the value of their lives. For example, the current uptake of breast screening for non-disabled women is 76% in the UK, but for women with learning disabilities it is between 17% for those living at home, and 52% for those in formal care. </p> <p>The proposed new public sector duty would ensure that deeply ingrained attitudes and patterns of exclusion are addressed head on. Public bodies will have to assess where the patterns of greatest inequality lie, then show what they are planning to do to eliminate them. </p> <p>Although this angry \"young\" man recognises that October 1 is indeed a time for celebration for all disabled people, I also warn - to borrow a phrase from Osborne - don't clap too hard. Britain is a very old building. It will be made accessible, but there is more to be done to exorcise its haunting prejudices. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Bert Massie is chairman of the Disability Rights Commission.</p>",
  "<p>There is something striking about San Francisco - and not just the bay, the cable cars or the Golden Gate Bridge. It's the sheer number of people out and about in wheelchairs, everywhere you go. Stroll along the waterfront and someone whizzes past. At the subway station, people wheel themselves neatly on to the train without a second thought. People with disabilities seem to fit in here with an ease that would surprise someone from Britain. </p> <p>It is not that there are huge numbers of disabled people in the bay area. They are simply more visible. They get out more in San Francisco because they can, because many of the obstacles that prevent people with disabilities living full and active lives have been removed. It is this that has made the city a model for British disability campaigners. According to Catherine Casserley, Disability Rights Commission senior legislative adviser, the city offers \"a glimpse into Britain's likely access future\". </p> <p>Disability activist and actor Julie Fernandez, best known as Brenda in the TV comedy The Office, has been navigating her wheelchair around San Francisco as a guest of the commission, with an eye on lessons for the London Underground - a service she has used just twice in her life. Her California visit, she admits, has made her realise exactly what ought to be possible in the UK, and has opened her eyes to how change might be achieved. \"I'd like to get a massive class action together, get a thousand people,\" she says. </p> <p>Sid Wolinsky, of a San Francisco-based not-for-profit law firm, Disability Rights Advocates, believes legislation, coupled with legal pressure from the disability community, can work as successfully in the UK as it has in California. Wolinsky has been prominent in taking out lawsuits under the Americans with Disabilities Act (now 12 years old and similar in scope to the UK's Disability Discrimination Act), which from next month requires any service open to the public to make \"reasonable\" arrangements to enable disabled access. For Wolinsky, this should mark a turning point for the UK. \"The landscape is going to look different,\" he predicts. </p> <p>In San Francisco, the effect is apparent all around. The Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) train link between San Francisco and the other bay area cities has lifts, no steps from platform to train, textured platforms to guide blind or partially sighted passengers, and announcements. In 1960s hippy hangout Haight-Ashbury, all but two of the shops - most of them small businesses - have a ramp leading through a wide doorway. The island prison of Alcatraz - the top tourist destination once famous for its inaccessibility - is now relatively easy to get to, with a wheelchair-friendly ferry and electronic buggy transport. </p> <p>Across the bay, Berkeley has taken things further. Banks have talking cash machines (you need to bring your own headphones) and road crossings are tailored for blind and partially sighted people, which make birdsong noises when it is safe to cross. At junctions, the north-south crossings chirp differently from the east-west crossings. </p> <p>The city administration has led the revolution, through the mayor's office on disability. It uses planning regulations to ensure that new or renovated buildings meet an access code. It is also responsible for the huge number of dropped kerbs on the city's streets and the impressive public transport sys tem, although it took a 1996 class action lawsuit to make sure the lifts at Bart stations were maintained in working order. Even the famous \"streetcars\" - vintage carriages much loved by tourists - have been made accessible, with raised platforms and other adaptations at passenger stops. </p> <p>It is disabled activists' use of the law that has made it stick, Wolinsky explains. \"The reason that compliance is relatively high in San Francisco, Berkeley and the bay area is that there is a well organised active disability community,\" he says. \"That's made a huge difference.\" </p> <p>Wolinsky claims that 80-90% of the cases taken by his firm have resulted in a settlement. Big names have been brought to book, too, such as Kaiser Permanente, the US healthcare firm. \"We received a number of complaints about accessible medical equipment and architectural obstacles,\" Wolinsky says. \"We filed a lawsuit and, 24 hours later, had a personal call from the chief executive.\" Kaiser moved swiftly to make the necessary changes across 35 California hospitals. Wolinsky says the beauty of such cases is the knock-on effect. Now other firms are under pressure to follow Kaiser's example. </p> <p>There are other lessons. Disabled people in Britain can expect to hear small businesses, restaurants, theatres, local authorities and others lobby hard and loud about the cost of adapting their buildings. \"We encountered that argument when the disabilities act first came into effect,\" Wolinsky says. \"We heard it every week: 'If we have to put in a ramp we'll have to close.' The truth of the matter is that, after hundreds and hundreds of lawsuits, I'm aware of only a single entity that actually closed - a restaurant.\" </p> <p>Susan Mizner, director of the mayor's office on disability, also encountered resistance - from within the city's own departments. Her office created a special fund so that departments that claim they \"don't have the money\" are presented with up to 90% of the necessary cash, with the condition that it is made a budget item the following year. </p> <p>City hall itself is impressively accessible. It has a long, elegant wheelchair ramp, landscaped to fit the period building; there are \"talking signs\", and braille guides by the lift doors. More impressive are the measures that allow disabled people to take part in city business. The city broadcasts its meetings by television and the internet, complete with captions and sign language interpretation. Those who want to have their say in a public meeting don't even have to get to city hall, but can use a special phone line - \"a very fancy conference call\" - and tell the clerk they want to speak. Coming soon are accessible voting systems that speak the candidates' names over earphones and allow voting with a simple button. \"It will allow many people with disabilities to vote privately for the first time,\" Mizner says. </p> <p>Paul Longmore, director of San Francisco University's Institute on Disability, says: \"The change has been staggering - not just the built infrastructure, but what this has meant for the freedom of disabled people. When I was growing up, in a public place I was usually the only person with a visible disability. The laws have transformed expectations and attitudes.\" But more remains to be done and, in a situation UK local authorities will find familiar, spending cuts are holding back progress. Mizner estimates that $120m (\u00a367m) of work is still needed in the city. Nor is access everything. With no equivalent of an NHS, and a harsher attitude to welfare benefits, the city is also home to people with disabilities who are forced to beg. \"There's no access if that's the case,\" says Richard Skaff, founder of the mayor's office on disability and now an access design consultant. </p> <p>For some British authorities, achieving the San Francisco effect could be long and painful. A recent disability commission survey found that more than 30% of local authorities had no idea how many of their services would be accessible for disabled people by October, while Transport for London has admitted that making the 150-year-old Tube system accessible is not going to happen soon. </p> <p>The commission and others will have their work cut out to reach the level of activism that has made a success of the law in California. Fernandez worries that \"the difficulty, in my experience, is there's so many people who don't even know what their rights are\". </p> <p>The gains, though, could be huge \"Once things are accessible, there's going to be loads of disabled people out and about,\" Fernandez says. \"Attitudes are only going to change once we become people's work colleagues and you're sitting next to us in restaurants.\"</p>",
  "The cover of last week's edition of Country Life featured a rugged huntsman on a lichened rock, a dog at his side and a sweep of open country dropping hazily away behind him. \"Is it Goodbye to All That?\" asked a coverline. Even if the huntsman didn't actually own the land in the picture, you gathered that the end of his vocation, and of his dog's, were connected, in some melancholy way, to the fate of all the open country behind him. <p>Country Life's reckoning that there is much more at stake here than the fate of some gingery vermin, is, of course shared, though with considerably more relish, by many non-subscribers to that magazine. George Monbiot's belief that the ban is a symbolic crushing of the feudal habit, has been echoed, with much crowing by fellow serfs on the Mirror and elsewhere, and now, with ramblers off the leash and the scent of blood in the air, the toff-hunt seems to be in full cry. Why shouldn't the beastly swells give up their land, as well as their decadent hobbies and oppressive red coats? </p> <p>The New Statesman, in particular, has its dander up. Its new land-reclamation campaign opened with a marvellously stimulating call to arms by Jason Cowley. Why, he asked, should the rest of us make do with little, or no land at all, when hereditary landowners have so much? \"The British aristocracy is,\" Cowley protests, \"a genuine market-dominant minority; centuries of inbreeding, to keep the bloodlines \"pure\", have created a tribe, a racially distinct sub-group of people who resemble one another, who have the same absurdly affected accents, who go in for the same few schools, who protect each other's interests and who continue to exert their control over the land through the armed forces, the Conservative party and the media, notably the Daily Telegraph ... \" </p> <p>Actually, this analysis strikes me as a bit indulgent. Perhaps Cowley was trying to avoid causing offence. At any rate, he neglected to point out that a large proportion of this little clan are, moreover, thick, complacent, philistine, anti-semitic, patronising, idle, snobbish, and convinced that the accident of their birth reflects terribly well on them. Many, had they not inherited houses, or estates - to which they remain tragically in thrall - would struggle to find work as a janitor. They combine a complacent affection for their own rank, and haphazardly acquired possessions, with a profound contempt for the lower classes' ambition and acquisitiveness. </p> <p>And yet, really, who cares? It was the one creditable achievement of Tony Blair, before he discovered his inner warmonger, to ensure that aristocrats would no longer govern us. Had he finished the job, it would have been a triumph. So although, in these troubled times, it is impressively energetic of the New Statesman to persecute the quondam ruling class, the choice of target remains eccentric. </p> <p>True, they still own a lot of land. But if the new towns and sprawling housing estates of John Prescott's vision are what this campaign is after, then many aristocrats would no doubt be delighted to part with unspoilt acreage, once relaxation of planning laws had been achieved. In fact, given the possibility of widespread resistance, from the clerkly classes, to the transformation of this newly liberated countryside into many gleaming new Prescottvilles, a more immediate easing of the housing shortage might be achieved by forcing bourgeois weekenders to surrender one of their two homes, preferably the country cottage. </p> <p>But maybe it is just the basic, feudal, them-and-us unfairness of it all that rankles? If so, a variety of political solutions present themselves; some already tried in the Soviet bloc, some not. Or does the strictly feudal, land-is-power avenging spirit of the times protect the Abramovich/Rausing/ Branson/Ecclestone capitalist class from the redistributive impulse? </p> <p>If, as seems to be the general view, the most offensive thing about posh people is, basically, their poshness, then if their opponents will only be patient, the desired end should not be far off. In The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy, David Cannadine predicted the extinction of inherited titles, if present trends continued, by 2175. An end to the EU subsidies and various tax dodges joyfully exploited by hereditary landowners, plus a few more years of death duties could soon see a few more estates go the way of Easton Neston, which remains on the market for \u00a350m. As well as Roman Abramovich, a Boris Berezovsky, is reputed to have shown interest in the 500-acre estate, ditto Robert Miller, an American duty-free billionaire. </p> <p>One recalls that the Fermor Hesketh family's decision to sell the estate after 470 years of unbroken possession, inspired more regret than rejoicing. One of the most irritating things about the aristocracy is its quite unjustified popularity. Cowley hates these grandee-shopkeepers for charging \"the rest of us for entering their lavish and ostentatious homes\". But nobody makes us go and gawp and buy tea-towels decorated with a picture of someone else's house. </p> <p>As the habits of National Trust members confirm, people with time on their hands are dismayingly prone to false consciousness. Nothing, it seems, is more delightful than the twin prospects of ancient serfdom and aristocratic excess. They really do want to peek, deferentially, inside the homes of people who are, in the Trust's case, no more than washed-up lodgers; and the more aristocratic remains - human as well as upholstered - they contain, the better. The same, indulgent impulse presumably explains the popularity of Gosford Park, and Snobs, by the actor and aristocrat, Julian Fellowes, in which arrivistes come unstuck. </p> <p>Like PG Wodehouse's Jeeves, who resists the revolutionary promptings of Comrade Rowbotham, a sentimental public may approve, and even protect the unloveliest relics of what the Comrade calls \"an exploded feudal system\". Indeed, if displays of fox-hunting were to feature, like miniature railways, gifte shoppes and captive lions in the hard-pressed aristocrat's array of high-class novelties, there is every chance the sport would not only survive, but turn a profit, courtesy of today's heritage-loving serfs. </p> <p> <b>The naked truth about work dreams </b></p> <p>When 500 people were polled recently for a recruitment group that hoped to work up a bit of publicity about our old friend, the work-life balance, almost half said they had regular dreams about work, including anxiety dreams, such as \"walking through their office with no clothes on\". </p> <p>I wonder if this can so readily be attributed to an oppressive workplace. Nakedness dreams are not, Freud tells us, inherently problematic; such dreams demand our attention only when the dreamer feels \"shame and embarrassment\". Do the fellow office workers react with indifference in the dream? If so, a kind of wish fulfilment could be involved. Are we returning here, to infantile delight in exhibitionism, or touching on some repressed memory, perhaps of being scolded for nakedness as a child? Which part of the office is involved? </p> <p>Although this is all too interesting for words, it seems hasty to blame bad dreams on work, not least because dream interpretation is such a notoriously unreliable business. Maybe such dreams tell us we feel guilty for not working hard enough, for having too much money, for companies that cannot do enough to help us? Unlikely, perhaps, though no more so than Freud's theories of repressed childish wishes which led to the attribution of embarrassing dreams, this week, to the \"UK's long hours culture\". </p> <p> <b>More fatherly concern </b> </p> <p>Many thanks to supporters of Fathers4Justice who wrote to explain why its costumed activists are not, as I had suggested, unrepresentative hobbyists, but victims of women's \"reckless pursuit of a Marxist-Feminist utopia\"; or as another puts it, \"the ignorant, self-righteous, holier-than-thou feminist nutters who brought about the need for this kind of action in the first place\". To say otherwise, argues yet another correspondent, is \"a disgusting feminist lie\". </p> <p>Before complying with another request to \"stop bitching\", I would just point out that if F4J activists would abandon their costumes and argue their case with the kind of style shown above, everyone might be much clearer about the true nature of their organisation.</p>",
  "Shortly before Michael Howard joined the conveyor belt of Conservative leaders, I happened to sit next to a wannabe Tory candidate at a party. I was alarmed to hear her tell other guests that Tory fortunes would inevitably revive because \"deep down we are all selfish\". With potential candidates like that, I thought, we barely needed the left to label us nasty. <p>At certain points in recent history, this unreconstructed take on the party's appeal might have seemed less crass. During the ideological clashes of the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher's machismo was certainly part of her appeal. But a decade later, Tony Blair captured a new zeitgeist, and the Conservative party has been struggling to come to terms with it ever since. New Labour has now squandered its relative advantage in the niceness stakes, but that is no excuse for Conservatives to fall back into complacency about the reasons they have been so consistently rejected. Niceness still matters. </p> <p>In image terms, Mr \"Prison Works\" was not an obvious leader to revive Tory fortunes. But his accession did pay dividends on the nice account by promoting much-needed party unity. Apart from a silly spat between the \"Notting Hill set\" and the \"bed-blockers\", it has only now been threatened by the fallout from the recent shadow cabinet reshuffle. Splits - in so far as they exist - are not between left and right or between modernisers and traditionalists. They centre on this issue of niceness. </p> <p>Even before Theresa May affronted Tory sensibilities with her racy shoes and by pointing out that many considered the party nasty, Howard, as shadow chancellor, had told backbench Tories he disagreed with those who emphasised that the party needed to be liked. Instead, it should be respected, he said. Eschewing the need to be nice would have won the support of colleagues who suspect that being preoccupied with niceness is a vacuous image-building exercise or a suspicious Portillista plot to dump principle, indulge interest groups and turn the party into New Labour by another name.</p> <p> Howard was positioning himself for the longer term, shoring up his Commons support. On becoming leader, his actions indicated he understood that his party hardly had the luxury to choose whether to be liked or respected - it needed to be both. He recruited modernisers. He did daytime TV. His leadership speech, with its stress on inclusiveness and social mobility, rightly emphasised compassion without having to forego the respect that should follow from developing and articulating these themes. The socially liberal agenda which has come to exemplify the pursuit of niceness may not be to Howard's taste, but he has, sensibly, allowed for a free vote when the social partnerships bill returns to the Commons. </p> <p>All of that was reassuring. However, signals since the reshuffle suggest that he is still preoccupied with shoring up an unreconstructed constituency beyond the Commons. Ironically, on issues such as the economy and public service reform there is little that divides the promoted John Redwood and the departed John Bercow, but each gives a very different impression of the sort of party they represent. Such impressions aren't always fair, but they matter. If the party is to broaden its appeal, it needs the counter-intuitive Bercow as much as, if not more than, the cerebral Redwood. </p> <p>In reality, two terms into opposition, this niceness issue might largely have resolved itself if party leaders had provided the substance that bemused voters so urgently require. While there has been no shortage of policy proposals, even Tory MPs admit to finding it difficult to determine or to sell a top line. Too many strong themes, from \"commonsense conservatism\" to \"small state - big people\", have been hinted at and then abandoned. A higher education policy that rejects fees may seem clever tactics, but being out of step with what most expect of Conservative thinking, it could just seem expedient. In contrast, some key policies consistent with Conservative principles (for example, scrapping inheritance tax and opposing ID cards) would offer campaigning focus. And concentrating market logic on the \"common ground\" of public services and law and order still has scope for radical, distinctive and practical policies which might encourage voters to consider trusting the party again.</p> <p>If niceness were just about pursuing fashionable whims, Howard's scepticism would have been right. But it's more fundamental than that. At the very least, niceness might mean fielding attractive ambassadors such as the other reshuffle casualties, Julie Kirkbride and Damien Green. But in policy terms, it need not, and it should not, mean a retreat to an indistinct \"centre ground\" or a repudiation of core Tory values. After all, it's hardly nice to deny voters a choice - particularly by a party which says it believes in it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jo-anne.nadler@tiscali.co.uk\">Jo-Anne Nadler</a> is the author of Too Nice to Be a Tory.</p>",
