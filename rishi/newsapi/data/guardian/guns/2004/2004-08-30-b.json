  "Here's how one estate agency, promoting homes in Mark Thatcher's Cape Town suburb, Constantia, describes the benefits of living in South Africa. \"A weak rand gives you tremendous buying power if you're paying with dollars or sterling,\" <a href=\"http://www.EscapeArtist.com\">EscapeArtist.com</a> reveals. \"Around R8,000 [\u00a3663] a month will do for a married couple. What kind of lifestyle will this buy you? A villa with a pool, a car and a daily maid... South Africa is one of the few places in the world where you'll find first world comforts and infrastructure, and third world prices on everything from food, to diamonds, to real estate ... South Africa has problems, but that's what makes for opportunity.\" <p>Africa, to the British upper classes, remains an adventure playground, a deer park and a treasury. And Constantia is one of those many enclaves of apartheid - to be found everywhere from Table Mountain to Mt Kenya - prospering in a post-apartheid continent. </p> <p>What happier roost could there be for Mark and his mother? Margaret Thatcher found that permitting British companies to break the sanctions against the apartheid regime turned South Africa's problems into our opportunities. When Mark was asked what he thought of his mother's position, he replied: \"My sympathy is with the struggling white community.\" </p> <p>In 2001, Lady Thatcher announced that she would spend part of every year in Constantia with her son. Here they could live, not far from Earl Spencer and Ian Smith, as the members of their adopted class lived in Britain before the second world war. For some of their neighbours, that era has never passed. The language in the begging letter sent from prison by Thatcher's friend Simon Mann (Eton, Sandhurst, Scots Guards), comes straight from PG Wodehouse. \"Smelly and Scratcher,\" he moaned, weren't helping their old chum. \"It may be that getting us out comes down to a large splodge of wonga!\" </p> <p>Mann and Thatcher (Harrow, too thick for anywhere else) belong to a class which still believes it has a God-given right to oversee the lives of the Africans. Among Lady Thatcher's friends with homes on the slopes of Table Mountain was John Aspinall (Rugby, Oxford, Royal Marines), the gambling millionaire, zoo-keeper and remnant of that species of upper-class British fascist that used to keep the Duke of Windsor company. Aspinall believed that most of the human population should be culled by means of \"benign genocide\". He argued that \"medical research should be funded into abortion, infanticide, euthanasia and birth control\" and described his third wife as \"a perfect example of the primate female, ready to serve the dominant male and make his life agreeable\". Aspinall worked with Mangosuthu Buthelezi to undermine the African National Congress. He argued that South Africa should be split into 30 bantustans. </p> <p>\"Aspers\" was the hub of a circle of rightwing extremists who sought to meddle in the affairs of Europe's former colonies. Robin Birley, the son of one of his closest friends, was mauled by one of Aspinall's tigers when he was 12, but this did their relationship no harm. Birley's mother left her husband for Aspinall's chum Sir James Goldsmith, and both Aspers and Birley (who inherited Annabel's, London's poshest nightclub, from his father) stood as candidates for Goldsmith's Referendum party. Some years ago, I had a furious row with Birley after he told me that he believed he had not just a right but a duty to give help to Renamo, the South African-backed force which terrorised the people of Mozambique.</p> <p>Another of Aspinall's friends was the Spectator columnist Taki Theodoracopoulos. With Carla Powell, the wife of Lady Thatcher's former private secretary, he led the campaign in the British rightwing press to canonise Buthelezi. Taki once wrote of Kenya that \"democracy is as likely to come to bongo-bongo land as I am to send a Concorde ticket to my children\". He has complained that \"Britain is being mugged by black hoodlums ... West Indians were allowed to immigrate after the war [and] multiply like flies\". In 1999, Taki and Birley funded the campaign to free Augusto Pinochet. Their PR man was Lady Thatcher's old spin doctor Lord Bell, who worked for the South African National party in the 1994 elections, and is now representing Mark.</p> <p>Ever since Cecil Rhodes seized Matabeleland, the British right's struggle for ideological control in Africa has been linked to its efforts to seize the continent's resources. Mann's network of nobs had its fingers in mines and oilfields all over Africa. The mercenaries who provided muscle in return for mining concessions tried to use class connections to make their operations respectable. </p> <p>Mann founded his company, Executive Outcomes, with the British businessman Tony Buckingham. Buckingham counted among his friends the privy counsellor and former leader of the Social Democrats, Lord Steel.Until 1997 when he resigned, Steel was a director of one of Buckingham's other African interests, a company called Heritage Oil and Gas. He said at the time that his resignation was due to the company's restructuring, but later reports said that he resigned because of its connections with Executive Outcomes. </p> <p>All this is a long introduction to what is supposed to be a column about Darfur. My purpose is to show that Africans have every reason to be suspicious of British involvement in their affairs. There is no question that the British are, and always have been, \"concerned\" about Africa, but their concern remains a proprietorial one. When the Sudanese government claims that Britain is after its oil and gold, it is half right: even if the British government isn't, some of its prominent citizens are. Thatcher is said to be among them. Last week Mann's alleged accomplice, Nick du Toit, testified in court in Equatorial Guinea that Thatcher was among them. He said that Thatcher wanted to buy helicopters from him for \"a mining operation going on in Sudan\". Thatcher denies all such allegations. </p> <p>The Sudanese government appears to be trying to commit genocide by natural causes in Darfur. The Fur, Massaleet and Zagawa peoples are being driven from their homes just as the rains are making survival in the bush almost impossible. Its claim that 1,200 people have been killed is risible. The UN says 50,000 have died; a more comprehensive analysis by the Sudan specialist Eric Reeves suggests 200,000. It's a catastrophe, and it's likely, partly as a result of the UN's disastrous procrastination, to become far worse. </p> <p>For once, the US and the UK governments appear to be on the right side, pressing Sudan more forcefully than the other members of the security council to disarm the Janjaweed militias and accept a large African Union peacekeeping force. We should support them. But they are hobbled by three massive credibility deficits. First, after the farce in Iraq and the sell-out in Israel, no Arab government will ever again trust them to intervene dispassionately. Second, the institutions they control - particularly the cannibalistic IMF - are responsible for more deaths every year in Africa than the Janjaweed. Third, Britain's colonial history is not yet over.</p> <p>The British are still hated in Africa, and with good reason. Tony Blair might huff and puff about the continent being a scar on the conscience of the world, but while our own citizens still regard it as their personal fiefdom, it's hard to see why anyone who lives there should take him seriously.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "The crowd at the campaign rally in Annandale, Virginia, knew exactly what it wanted. As President George Bush mounted the podium, the cry went up: \"Four more years! Four more years!\" <p>It is a cry that will be heard again and again this week at the Republican party's national convention in New York City. But while four more years of Mr Bush seems a terrific idea to the party faithful, the prospect arouses mixed feelings beyond America's shores. </p> <p>For Britain, in particular, Mr Bush's term in office has proved divisive and occasionally humiliating, especially in respect of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but also over issues ranging from climate change and the international criminal court to protectionist American steel tariffs. </p> <p>There can be no doubt that Britain has been a good friend to the US in recent years. Whether the Bush administration has been a good friend to Britain is a different matter altogether. </p> <p>So would four more years of Mr Bush follow the same pattern? The authors Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay, in their new book on the neo-conservative hegemonistic tendency, America Unbound, believe that the president has wrought a permanent foreign policy revolution. </p> <p>They cite, in particular, his doctrine of pre-emptive war and regime change, his disdain for the \"international community\", and his unabashed unilateralism. It is what Robert Hunter, a former US ambassador to Nato, diplomatically calls a \"major experiment in foreign policy\". </p> <p>But another body of US opinion, typified by Joseph Nye of Harvard, holds that recent experience - not least the chastening lessons of Iraq - are already pushing Mr Bush back toward a more traditional, consensus-based approach. </p> <p>Professor Nye suggests that a second term would see greater US emphasis on allies and institutions and a search for negotiated, rather than military, solutions in places like North Korea. </p> <p>Significantly, perhaps, a senior Republican senator, Chuck Hagel, recently called on the administration to \"help strengthen global institutions... Winning the war on terrorism will require a seamless network of relationships\", he said. </p> <p>The UN, Mr Hagel said, \"is more relevant today than it has ever been... [it] has an essential role to play in post-conflict transitions\". </p> <p>Britain's former foreign secretary Robin Cook also believes Mr Bush's actions since 2001 have demonstrated the limitations rather than the attractions of unilateralism. Rather than test this theory further, Mr Cook and others like him would plainly prefer to deal in future with a President John Kerry. </p> <p>But whether or not Mr Bush has learned his lessons, Britain and Mr Blair must anticipate more sharp-edged problems with US policy if a second Bush term comes to pass. </p> <p>One simmering area of disagreement concerns the Palestine-Israel conflict. Mr Blair has repeatedly personally championed the \"road map\" peace process; reports from Washington suggest that Mr Bush has effectively abandoned it. This is a row just waiting to happen. </p> <p>Iran remains a big worry. While the potential for a transatlantic rift can be exaggerated, given London's disappointment at Tehran's perceived recent backward steps, US sabre-rattling echoes jarringly down Whitehall's corridors.</p> <p>Syria and Cuba reveal clearer differences in approach. Mr Bush's controversial Latin America special envoy, Otto Reich, has been quietly cooking up a \"transition strategy\" for a post-Castro Cuba, ignoring the fact that President Castro is still very much around.</p> <p>Threatening behaviour towards Damascus and Havana may be an unsavoury feature of a second Bush term. Meanwhile, further American \"war on terror\" excesses and its abuses of human rights and judicial processes could prove politically explosive in London. </p> <p>Mr Bush's refusal to support multilateral arms control and counter-proliferation treaties, particularly dismaying to Britain, would be another ongoing source of friction. There is a high embarrassment factor, too, in his insistence on pursuing \"son of Star Wars\" missile defences, including upgraded British facilities. </p> <p>Given the enduring importance to the US of cheap foreign oil, as highlighted by the presidential campaign, Mr Blair's efforts to resuscitate the Kyoto pact may continue to struggle. Nor is another British priority - meeting the UN's millennium development goals and raising overall foreign aid - likely to receive much bottom-line encouragement.</p> <p>It may be that a second-term Bush will be a changed man. Failing that admittedly optimistic scenario, it may be that Mr Blair will be able to paper over any difficulties and disappointments, as hitherto, and so maintain his White House best-buddy routine.</p> <p>That assumes, of course, that Mr Blair will also be granted the favour of four more years.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> Though charmed by the many profiles of Mark Thatcher, a Diary source is on with a clarification in the interests of historical accuracy. When discussing Mark's mid-70s stint at Touche Ross, they note, it is always said he failed his accountancy exams three times before giving up. A poignant tale - and almost true, for after Denis helped him to a place at the firm, Mark did indeed fail the exams twice. During his third attempt, as with both previous shots, he was given a company's books to prepare as an exercise. It is not known how he spent his time in the weeks leading up to deadline, other than that it was not within a mile of these books. Having left it to the very last minute, the boy Thatcher came up with a cunning plan: specifically, to obtain the firm's audited accounts for the previous year, and to reproduce them, adding 5% to each figure. The books were duly returned to the company... who took approximately eight seconds to see through the ruse and contacted Touche Ross in fury. Touche Ross duly summoned Denis and informed him that they had decided not to take formal action against Mark, but would see to it that he would never be permitted to sit the exams again. Still, every cloud and so on: this was the turn of Fortune's wheel that precipitated the birth of Mark Thatcher Racing. <p><b>\u00b7</b> Surveillance: Derry Irvine, at midday on Friday, at Cafe L'express on Horseferry Road.

  "<p>Sir Bobby Robson was too permanently young to see the job through. His date of birth in 1933 is not etched into him so deeply as the irrepressible romanticism that normally belongs to people decades his junior. Attractive as the trait is, it came to be an obstacle to Newcastle United, who removed him yesterday. </p> <p>Robson's enraptured view of football is seductive, but few of the commentators who popped up to be sorrowful over his departure went so far as to claim that the club were mistaken. The benefits of the manager's fervour had been exhausted two seasons ago, when Newcastle did not qualify for the Champions League proper. </p> <p>In the current Premiership only Sir Alex Ferguson, Alan Curbishley and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger have held their posts longer than he has. Robson, installed in 1999, could not have continued to survive unless he had shown that his plans for Newcastle were evolving. </p> <p>The manager, however, looked at practicalities with reluctance, thus accentuating a characteristic that has bedevilled the club for decades. Substance is of limited interest, whether it concerns the character of signings or the structure of the team. </p> <p>Kieron Dyer received lectures from Robson about his lifestyle and attitude to women. Newcastle, who did not even give him a place as a substitute at Villa Park on Saturday, should wonder if it would not have been easier to refrain from signing such an individual in the first place. </p> <p>Robson is not the type to keep footballers under surveillance or, within limits, to fret over their leisure pursuits. Patrick Kluivert got his first goal at the weekend but his scoring record will be hard pressed to keep pace with a rumoured number of late nights out. </p> <p>Whether or not the dressing room was under control, discipline has definitely been missing on the pitch. With the exception of Jonathan Woodgate, now transferred to Real Madrid, there has not been a high-quality addition to the back four. It was as if Robson begrudged spending money on markers and tacklers, yet that has been a grave error. Irresolute Newcastle have not won a Premiership away match since October. </p> <p>There are suggestions, too, that they hamper themselves with outdated preparations. The Premiership's backroom staffs include nutritionists, sports psychologists, chiropractors and a practitioner of oriental medicine, with one club even considering a meditation teacher. It may smack of quackery but Arsenal, and now Bolton, have benefited from exploring every avenue. </p> <p>At Newcastle, the passionate Robson barely delegated at all and Craig Bellamy's spat with the coach John Carver put the authority of the backroom staff in question. Sir Alex Ferguson brought Carlos Queiroz, a gifted and hard taskmaster of the training ground, back to Manchester United and there was no one of that calibre in the background at St James' Park. </p> <p>Robson has had an outstanding career, gathering trophies in the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain to go with the FA Cup and Uefa Cup that he took with Ipswich. If his pragmatic aspect was suppressed when he came back to his native territory, it could be because there is a communal dreaminess on Tyneside that affected him. </p> <p>There, the genuinely special place that the game holds in people's lives gives them the delusion that they are exempt from mundane considerations. They expect to prevail because they care more and they keep believing that grand flourishes on the field will do the trick. </p> <p>It didn't work for Robson any more than it did for Kevin Keegan. After 35 years without silverware, the lesson still has not sunk in and there are plenty of others who take an emotional stance. Freddy Shepherd, the chairman, was withering a few weeks ago about Robson's use of \u00a370m of the club's money, but perhaps he too is impulsive. The departed manager is thought to have had little part in the bid for Wayne Rooney, making the conclusion inescapable that it is the board who consider a \u00a325m teenage forward to be the proper recruit for a club who have sold an outstanding centre-half. This Geordie dream-state could pave the way for further wayward policies. </p> <p>There is now a hankering to install Alan Shearer in a senior position, even though he has only recently put his mind to coaching qualifications. Newcastle are in the grip of a myth that demands a native-born redeemer. If they succumb to it, pragmatic clubs who appoint the most capable candidates will keep on finishing above them.</p>",
  "<p>Marseille likes to bill itself \"a shock as much as a city\" but it was the predictability of Newcastle United's defeat in the Stade V\u00e9lodrome in the Uefa Cup semi-final second leg on May 6 - and the shocking reaction it provoked from fans - which ultimately resulted in Sir Bobby Robson reaching a dead end on Tyneside yesterday morning. </p> <p>Newcastle went into that match level after a goalless first leg at St James' Park. But two goals from Chelsea-bound Didier Drogba ensured they progressed no further. Without the injured Jonathan Woodgate for the return, once again they defended questionably. </p> <p>No surprise there. But it was when the players, management and directors encountered Newcastle fans afterwards that the shocks started coming. The sheer hostility of supporters towards all at United genuinely startled key decision-makers. Mentally something changed that night. </p> <p>In the dressing room it was no less fraught. Robson previously had difficulty dealing with the backchat of Kieron Dyer, Craig Bellamy and others; soon it would get worse. </p> <p>But first Newcastle had three Premiership games when they returned from Marseille. They could still make the Champions League if all were won. They won none, even drawing with Wolves at home. </p> <p>So the Champions League was gone, for a second season in a row. The previous summer, Newcastle had botched their qualifier against Partizan Belgrade and found themselves dumped in Europe's secondary club competition. If Marseille was a crossroads for Robson and Newcastle, Partizan was the first step down the road. </p> <p>Alan Shearer, of all people, missed a penalty that night. His personal situation had been clouded by the knowledge that Robson had contemplated selling him to Liverpool that summer; their relationship never fully recovered. </p> <p>Robson must have reflected upon the Shearer penalty every time the Partizan game was mentioned. And it was mentioned a lot. After a club then without a trophy for 34 years were knocked out at home by West Brom in the League Cup - Shearer on the bench - it was heard. After the tame fourth-round FA Cup defeat at Liverpool it was heard. After every failure to win away from home in the Premiership - and there were 17 of those - it was heard. </p> <p>The chairman Freddy Shepherd felt compelled to speak out after Christmas about players earning \"Rolls-Royce wages\" but not delivering. Newcastle had just drawn 1-1 at Leicester City thanks to a 90th-minute equaliser. </p> <p>Robson did not like Shepherd's outbursts. He felt it was his job to maintain discipline. But Shepherd was aware of the sort of training-ground disruption that would culminate in a public fracas between Bellamy and the first-team coach John Carver at Newcastle airport. </p> <p>If that was embarrassing, accusations linking some Newcastle players to an incident at the Grosvenor House hotel after the team lost to Arsenal last September did not do the club any favours, even though no charges were ever brought. </p> <p>And there were other incidents. Yet often Robson seemed most concerned about stories about the club getting out. \"Who's the cuckoo?\" he would ask the local press. By the opening game of this season at Middlesbrough he was asking: \"Is there a conspiracy?\" </p> <p>To him it probably seemed that way. Players such as Nicky Butt and Patrick Kluivert, whom he said privately he did not want, arrived anyway. Shepherd was doing the buying now and Robson would refer quietly to Paul Stretford - Shepherd's associate and agent to Wayne Rooney - as \"Newcastle's chief scout\". </p> <p>In public, though, Robson persevered with the idea that he bought Kluivert and Butt. He is a good actor but when, 30 days ago, Shepherd said \"No\" - in public - to the possibility of Robson staying beyond next May, he was flummoxed. He already knew but now everyone knew. He could not sustain the act. </p> <p>Those 30 days would have been eventful even without that destabilising background. Stephen Carr, Woodgate, Dyer (pre and post-apology) and Rooney are just a few of the players bought, sold or talked about. There were also four games - two drawn, at Boro and home to Norwich; two lost, at home to Spurs and at Aston Villa. </p> <p>Saturday at Villa was to be Robson's 255th and last as Newcastle manager. Dramatically his final act was to drop Shearer, just as his predecessor Ruud Gullit had done. That precipitated Gullit's downfall. But not Robson's. His began quite some time ago. </p> <p><strong>Twelve years of failure</strong></p> <p><strong> Kevin Keegan </strong> (1992-97) </p> <p>P251 W138 D51 L62 </p> <p>Newcastle were heading for the then Third Division when Keegan took over from Ossie Ardiles. They were promoted to the Premiership the next year but Keegan fell out with the club and quit in high dudgeon. </p> <p><strong> Highest finish:</strong> 2nd </p> <p><strong> Kenny Dalglish </strong> (1997-98) </p> <p>P78 W30 D22 L26 </p> <p>The Scot took over in the New Year and finished strongly. But after selling Les Ferdinand and David Ginola a newly dull Newcastle ended up 13th the following season and Dalglish was sacked at the start of the next. </p> <p><strong> Highest finish:</strong> 2nd <strong> FA Cup:</strong> losing finalists </p> <p><strong> Ruud Gullit </strong> (1998-99) </p> <p>P52 W18 D14 L20 </p> <p>Gullit took over and promised sexy football at St James' but hardly convinced by buying Duncan Ferguson for \u00a38m. Dropped Alan Shearer against arch rivals Sunderland, lost and resigned. </p> <p><strong> Highest finish:</strong> 13th <strong> FA Cup:</strong> losing finalists </p> <p><strong> Bobby Robson </strong> (1999-04) </p> <p>P255 W119 D64 L72 </p> <p>Brought initial stability to the club but paid the price for lack of European success. Had problems controlling unruly elements in the dressing room. Dropped Shearer against Aston Villa and lost. Was sacked yesterday. </p> <p><strong> Highest finish: </strong> 3rd</p>",
  "<p>Once a blue always a blue unless, it seems, your career might benefit from playing in red, or even in black and white. Wayne Rooney was nowhere to be seen on Saturday, though his name was everywhere. </p> <p>It was spat out in disgust from the stands, the chants degenerating into cruder renditions of \"There's only one greedy bastard\" by the end. More disturbingly, it was sprayed sinisterly on the wall of the Gwladys Street infant school. For all that, a planned half-time walk out failed to materialise and a protest against the board outside the ground attracted only 25 people, it was hard to escape the sense that the locals have been let down by one of their own. </p> <p>The desperate half-price sale of Rooney posters and shirts in the club shop failed to generate much interest. The 18-year-old will have heard the chants and felt the mood as he listened to commentary at his Formby home though, while there was little support emanating from the fans, there was understanding from his soon-to-be former team-mates. </p> <p>\"We heard what was being shouted and it was a culmination of the last three months, all the frustration coming out and people showing how it has hurt them,\" said Alan Stubbs. \"But look at the bigger picture. As footballers you sometimes only get one chance and you have to grab it. That chance has come for Wayne. </p> <p>\"It's the biggest decision he has ever had to make in his life and, for someone as young as him, it's hard. He's getting help from his advisors but Wayne knows what he wants. He has had a taste for it with the European Championship and, from a footballing point of view, I can understand where he is coming from. There was a bit of despondency among the fans. They're looking to take their frustration out on the players, the directors or whoever. But the sooner we get on with it the better. Everton still goes on.\" </p> <p>They go on with a second successive victory, secured by another local youngster - the 23-year-old Leon Osman - who nodded them in front early on, then flicked in the decisive goal midway through the second period. </p> <p>David Moyes's side were the better team throughout and have done enough to suggest this season may not be all doom and gloom. Today's trip to Old Trafford will be a reality check after victories over Crystal Palace and West Bromwich but none of the newly promoted teams have eked out a win yet and the gulf looks horrendous. </p> <p>Albion are doing their best to bridge it, but they disappointed here. Scott Dobie flicked them level at the near post but even their customary discipline at the back was lacking. A club record \u00a33.5m fee has been agreed with Cardiff for Robert Earnshaw, who underwent a medical on Saturday, though personal terms - mainly image rights and bonuses - remain a problem. </p> <p>The Welshman's agent went public yesterday presumably in a bid to flush out other interested clubs, though Gary Megson remains hopeful. Recruiting a young striker could prove pivotal to Albion's season; getting over the loss of one will be just as significant for Everton. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match:</strong> Joseph Yobo (Everton).</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 is holding talks with the BBC which could lead to an alliance or the sale of the corporation's commercial assets to the publicly owned broadcaster. </p> <p>As well as an acquisition of some of the BBC's assets by Channel 4, the two sides are exploring greater cooperation in distribution and programme sales overseas. </p> <p>Mark Thompson, director-general of the BBC, and Andy Duncan, chief executive of Channel 4, have already met to discuss ways the two public service broadcasters can work more closely together. </p> <p>The discussions are still at an early stage. Mr Duncan left the BBC this month to replace Mr Thompson as Channel 4's chief executive. </p> <p>However, sources close to the talks believe that the shared background of the two executives, added to the commercial and political imperatives they face, have helped ease initial overtures. The talks are understood to have the backing of Luke Johnson, Channel 4's chairman. </p> <p>Senior executives at Channel 4 believe that the purchase of parts of BBC Worldwide would give the commercially funded broadcaster a firmer footing going forward. Like other terrestrial channels, Channel 4, which derives most of its revenues from advertising, is expected to lose market share as more homes adopt multi-channel television. </p> <p>It is unlikely that Channel 4 could or would take over all of the disparate BBC Worldwide business - which includes the Radio Times and a huge consumer publishing arm, and is worth an estimated \u00a31bn. </p> <p>It is understood to be most interested in the BBC's share of UKTV, a joint venture with cable group Telewest, as well as its programme sales and rights distribution arm. </p> <p>An agreement could lead to a distribution company set up to sell British public service TV - largely provided by the BBC and Channel 4 - overseas. Any deal would be designed to cut administrative costs and increase revenue for Channel 4. </p> <p>The BBC is widely expected to spin off part or all of BBC Worldwide as it prepares for charter review. Some analysts believe that a sale or agreement with Channel 4 - which is likely to include some sort of licensing deal - could be easier to sell to the government and industry regulators. </p> <p>Executives at both broadcasters are also keen to avoid one idea, mooted by industry regulator Ofcom among others, to share out the licence fee under the charter review to other public service providers, such as Channel 4. </p> <p>In his first major speech as director-general, at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television festival yesterday, Mr Thompson indicated his willingness to explore alliances with all public service television providers as part of the corporation's review of its commercial arm. \"Where we can sensibly collaborate and combine [without distorting the market] so much the better,\" he said. \"I welcome a dialogue with Andy from C4 and other PSBs [public service broadcasters] to see if we can get together more.\" </p> <p>His words echoed those of Mr Duncan who had said the channel was looking at \"a whole range of options [to] future-proof C4\". </p> <p>\"There are clear areas where mutual cooperation [with the BBC] could help in terms of saving money,\" he said, before highlighting the sectors of education and new media. </p> <p>He denied that his interest in the BBC had taken the place of Channel 4's consideration of an alliance with Channel Five, the broadcaster owned by RTL and United Business Media. </p> <p>Other companies, including ITV, are also said to be interested in BBC Worldwide.</p>",
  "It would be unusual anywhere at nine in the morning, but in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan the proposal borders on the illegal. <p>\"A coffee?\" asks chief executive Minoo Bhandara, reaching across his desk. \"Or would you prefer a beer?\" </p> <p>Mr Bhandara can afford such audacity because he runs Murree Brewery, Pakistan's lone beer factory in a country under prohibition. </p> <p>In 1977 the military leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto imposed an alcohol ban on Muslims, who make up 97% of the population. Since then only minority faiths - such as Christians, Hindus and Mr Bhandara's Zoroastrian faith - can drink. In theory. </p> <p>In reality, Murree products are selling curiously well. Sales of the Classic beer, a light, crisp lager, rose 12% last year. Its gin, brandy and whisky products are also doing well. </p> <p>All this despite a phalanx of official restrictions. The explanation is simple, says Mr Bhandara: \"Ninety-nine per cent of our customers are Muslim.\" </p> <p>Although an advertising ban means few Pakistanis are familiar with the company slogan, \"eat, drink and be Murree\", millions are following its call. Officially, beer is hard to procure. There are about 66 licensed alcohol outlets across the country, which are unevenly distributed. Punjab province, with 70 million inhabitants, has just eight shops selling alcohol, while the sparsely populated Baluchistan region has 15. </p> <p>The system is riddled with enterprising abuse. Bootleggers run a thriving black market by snapping up beer quotas from Christians for resale to Muslims. Imported alcohol floods into Pakistan through all its borders. </p> <p>Chinese vodka is spirited across the northern mountain passes, while ancient dhows carry crates of western beer and scotch from the Gulf states to Pakistan's west coast. In the capital Islamabad diplomats at some central Asian and African embassies are known to offer a discreet take-away service from their diplomatic compounds, in return for a hefty mark-up. </p> <p>Government officials turn a blind eye to the abuses, and well they might: even the president, Pervez Musharraf, is known to enjoy a glass of scotch at the end of a hard day. And as far as anyone knows, the official punishment sanctioned by the Qur'an, 80 lashes with an oil-soaked whip, has never been applied. </p> <p>To some, the nudge-wink attitude is a healthy sign of creeping liberalism in Pakistan, inspired by Gen Musharraf's pledge to curb Islamic extremism. But for Mr Bhandara, it is simply double standards. </p> <p>\"It's totally hypocritical,\" he said. \"No matter what happens, at least 5% of our people will want to drink beer. And they know there's nothing sinful about it.\" </p> <p>There have always been challenges for the brewery, a relic of the Raj and also Pakistan's oldest company. Founded in 1861 to slake the thirst of British troops, Murree was named after a hill station above present-day Islamabad. </p> <p>Although sales peaked during the second world war, business was never plain sailing. An earthquake consumed Murree's Quetta brewery in 1935; a Muslim mob torched its original building in 1947. </p> <p>Today the Murree brewery is beside the army headquarters in Rawalpindi, in an old-fashioned complex a stone's throw from President Musharraf's palm-shaded house . </p> <p>Among the 350 mostly Muslim employees, some hold a possibly unique position. The quality control manager, Fakher-E-Mahmood, for example, supervises standards without a drop of beer passing his lips. \"We have another team for that,\" he said. \"I arrange the tasting, they tell me if anything is wrong.\" </p> <p>Noor Ellahi, an employee for 41 years, supervises 430 casks of maturing whisky. He says he has never been tempted.\"No, never. I am totally not inclined,\" he said. But even if he was, opportunities are limited. A team of government excise officials and security guards roam the compound, to ensure that no contraband slips out. </p> <p>Murree retains a distinctly old-world feel. Mr Bhandara, a softly spoken 66-year-old with an often-distracted air, commands operations from behind a Victorian desk. </p> <p>He hopes to sell Murree in Indian restaurants in the UK under the slogan Have a Murree With Your Curry, and although an earlier drive failed he is now looking for a British brewing partner. </p> <p>But will prohibition ever be lifted at home? </p> <p>Mr Bhandara, who is fond of saying, \"We have a great future in front of us\", thinks not. \"The law will be lax one day, tough the next. But it will still be with us.\"</p>",
  "John Humphrys - that self-proclaimed \"timid soul\" - is right, of course. It's almost impossible to switch on your TV \"without encountering some sort of aggression\". Especially in the soaps, he adds: see those acrid EastEnders snarl and threaten each other in a warped world where any routine chat may end in hurled teacups. The violence of language shocks and stuns. This is conflict as the norm, confrontation as a way of life. <p>Which is not, in truth, how we try to live our own lives. Marriage, partnership? Deep down, we're afraid of Virginia Woolf. We need - with love - to share and compromise and bite our lips. We can't long co-exist on a diet of rows and rampages. Families have to learn to rub along. There's give and there's take. There's the necessity, at home or in the office, to smooth the sharp edges and shrug off the angst. Nobody gives gold medals for shouting matches. Everybody knows that continuous confrontation equals bitter exhaustion. </p> <p>But hang on a second - or at least for a few thousand words in Humphrys' high-profile Edinburgh TV festival lecture. Here he is on his own day job. \"We need more, not less, in-depth interviewing of politicians. The idea that tough questions prevent politicians from giving answers, and gentle chats seduce them into candour, is frankly risible.\" </p> <p>In short, we - the viewers, the listeners, the would-be voters - need our surrogates for confrontation. It is conflict which makes our political world turn. Snarls and threats come as basic equipment. Rows are standard, not extras. </p> <p>That is usually the way it seems. Here we are today in the benign reaches of a bank holiday, and hundreds of thousands of demonstrators are besieging Madison Square Garden while the erstwhile director general of the BBC (JH's boss of bosses) accuses Tony Blair of being either a bullying liar or a supreme incompetent. Confrontation, confrontation ...</p> <p>You might, on the train home from Edinburgh, call it political soap opera, as \"coarsening and brutalising\" as Humphrys claims. You might wonder if the television of crude sub-reality he labels \"rubbish\" isn't the appropriate medium of choice for most political debate. </p> <p>But come back for a second to that ordinary life, to a quiet weekend with Humphrys rocking his four-year-old son on his knee in front of the marathon, to Greg Dyke weeding his garden and Tony idly comparing Silvio's bath taps with Sir Cliff's. George and Laura aren't playing Macbeth and his lady this morning, John Kerry's saluting arm has got frozen elbow. This is compromise land, this is rub-along territory. Why does it all have to change utterly when the arc lights glare? What turns blokes into beasts? </p> <p>And that - the bane of broadcasting, the magic of spin doctors - is a question without a simple answer. Mix a tablespoonful of power-crazed powder, a short measure of attention span, a pinch of boredom, a cup of crudity and a litre of misunderstanding and you might have a recipe that goes some of the way to make rock-and-hard-place cakes. Much of the time, Humphrys and his like perform a vital service. Much of the time, challenge and interrogation are top of the menu. But, just occasionally, like Humphrys p\u00e8re et fils switching channels from Dirty Den to David Attenborough, you hanker after great missing ingredients like detail, nuance and understanding. For confrontation, read explanation.</p> <p>This lack, of context and comprehension, isn't the fault of the broadcasters. It's endemic in our way of conducting public affairs. School debates are about winning and losing. Parliamentary debates for elderly schoolboys are either scrums or dreary no-shows. Everywhere we look, there are fierce arguments staged so that we have an apparent choice. You, the jury, hear prosecution and defence, and then decide. Governance by confrontation. It is not ordinary life, but it is our way of seeming to run things: administration behind screens of histrionic hostility.</p> <p>Feel alienated from the political process? Here's one of the reasons why. Less likely to bother to vote next time than you would be in much of Europe? Maybe because that Europe, with proportional representation guaranteeing frequent compromise, with examining magistrates scouring for truth rather than refereeing a court contest, has less confrontation built into the system. It is not automatically a better or worse way of running affairs, but its heartbeat is different.</p> <p>And such difference, very soon, will be a critical test of the Humphrys thesis and of broadcast journalism itself. Does it matter if we're in, out or vestigially connected to Europe? Of course it matters, and there's a climactic vote promised. But is confrontation the only route to that choice? Can understanding get a word in edgeways? </p> <p>The choice we seem to have is between two business cliques (those who trade with Europe and those who don't much), between keep-calm integrationists and fiery anti-federalists. Stark confrontation complete. But will we get independent academic advice on the constitution? Will we hear in far more specific detail about the role of British ministers sitting in Brussels approving draft law before it ever comes to Westminster? Will the MPs whose job it is to scrutinise such legislation make it on to the Today show for more than three minutes? Explanation, explanation ...</p> <p>America decides its next president in a flurry of smears. Cynicism beyond confrontation. Britain prepares to decide its future, and the barricades are duly built. But where do not-so-timid public broadcasters need to stand? On our side, I think. And we need to understand what's at stake, to be informed in just the same careful, grown-up way that we seek to eke out an ordinary, civilised existence. We want hope, not soap.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "France last night dispatched its foreign minister, Michel Barnier, to the Middle East in an attempt to save the lives of two journalists kidnapped by Iraqi militants who have demanded that Paris revokes its ban on Islamic headscarves in schools. <p>With the 48-hour ultimatum due to expire today, President Jacques Chirac and a team of ministers spent yesterday in crisis meetings, discussing how to respond to the emergency, but there was no hint that they planned to yield to the demands of an extremist group, the Islamic Army of Iraq. </p> <p>In a televised address on Saturday, the kidnappers gave France two days to overturn a law, due to come into force this week, banning all conspicuous displays of religious faith in state schools, describing the legislation as \"an aggression on the Islamic religion and personal freedoms\". </p> <p>Mr Chirac said he would spare no effort to free the two men, but defended the new law. \"France ensures equality, the respect and protection of the free practising of all religions. These values of respect and tolerance inspire our actions everywhere in the world ... They also inspired France's policy in Iraq.\" </p> <p>The timing of the threat, three days after an Italian journalist, Enzo Baldoni, was killed by the same organisation, prompted alarm. </p> <p>\"The situation is serious,\" the prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, said. \"We have mobilised all our energy to secure the liberation of our compatriots who have been taken in such an odious manner.\" </p> <p>Christian Chesnot, a radio journalist, and Georges Malbrunot, of Le Figaro, were seized on August 20 while travelling on the notoriously treacherous road between Baghdad and Najaf. Their employers had no information about their whereabouts until the Arabic television station al-Jazeera broadcast footage of them, looking tired and frightened, late on Saturday. </p> <p>There was dismay in France that a country which has vehemently opposed the conflict should be vulnerable to the same kind of violence used against states participating in the war. But the government's decision in March to strengthen its secular principle in the face of rising Islamic extremism with a law banning the veil in schools was greeted with hostility in much of the Arab world. </p> <p>Earlier this year Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's deputy, accused France of \"crusader hatred\" against Muslims, while an Islamist group called the legislation \"a declaration of war to the Muslim world\" and threatened \"to plunge France into terror and remorse and spill blood outside its frontiers\". </p> <p>Asked if France was ready to review its position on the headscarf ban, a spokesman for the president's office said: \"I don't think we are at that point for the moment.\" </p> <p>Lhaj Thami Breze, the head of the Union of French Islamic Organisations, which is encouraging schoolgirls to break the new law, stressed that it was a domestic matter. \"There can be no negotiations. France deserves thanks from Iraq, not punishment,\" he said. </p> <p>Although little is known about the Islamic Army of Iraq, the journalists are almost certainly in the hands of a hardline Sunni Islamist group with close links to the \"resistance\" in Falluja. The journalists' employers expressed hope that the ultimatum was a demand for a response from the French government rather than a countdown to murder.</p>",
  "Today on American television, a cable channel will broadcast Trial Heat, live coverage from a court somewhere in the US, Forensic Files (\"Ever wonder how the cops solve the tough cases?\") and Power, Privilege and Justice, by \"the most penetrating chronicler today of the arrogance that leads the rich to believe they are above the law\". This is CourtTV - \"The investigation channel\" - devoted solely to broadcasting televised court proceedings, together with accompanying trial-related material. Is this what Britain wants, or needs? Would this kind of TV coverage help justice in the UK? <p>Many might doubt it. I think they would be right. The spectre of the OJ Simpson trial in 1995, where criminal proceedings were transformed into a media circus, still hangs over the US courts: the judge in the rape trial in Eagle, Colorado, involving the American basketball player Kobe Bryant is only the latest to ban cameras in his courtroom to avoid OJ-style grandstanding from all involved. </p> <p>But if I'm clear that we want no OJ-style TV trials here, I'm clear too that the time is now right for us to look at the issue of televising the courts in England and Wales. Our justice system exists to do justice. If it does not do justice in public, it risks slipping into unacceptable behaviour and losing public confidence. Justice must be done, and justice must be seen to be done. </p> <p>Subject to a few exceptions, such as family cases and cases involving national security, our courts are open to the public. But few people ever go near a court to hear justice done in their names. Most people's knowledge and perception of what is done in court comes from news reporting of cases. Yet the medium which gives most people most access to information is not allowed in court. Trials cannot be televised. Neither can hearings in the court of appeal. Judgments by the senior court in the land, the law lords sitting in the House of Lords, can be, under the provisions for televising parliament which were agreed in 1990. We will ensure that position continues when we bring in, for the first time in Britain, a new supreme court, sitting outside parliament. Supreme court judgments will be able to be televised, as law lords' judgments are now.</p> <p>Should the position in the lower courts change? Is there a public interest in allowing people, through TV, to see what happens in court? We believe that in this modern media age, where television is the norm in everyone's lives, there is a case to be examined here. That is what the government is now going to do. I will issue, I hope later this year, a detailed document which will be a careful and considered examination of all the issues involved, to be followed by full and widespread consultation with all sides.</p> <p>But there are some starting points. Crucially, we will need to consider separately both trials and appeals. Nobody thinks family proceedings should be broadcast. Neither do I. The greatest interest - including the interest of the broadcasters themselves, who have with 24-hour satellite and cable TV hugely expanded the TV market in Britain - will be in criminal trials, and it is easy to think of trials in recent years where there is a legitimate public interest and where the broadcasters would have wished to have live or near-live coverage and footage available to use in news and current affairs programmes.</p> <p>But those responsible for the justice system have to consider the effect on justice. Justice being done and being seen to be done is not a two-part notion of equal weight, but a priority list, and no reforms to the justice system to make it more open and accessible can interfere with that.</p> <p>Witnesses are obviously the most important issue. Effective criminal justice depends on people giving evidence. There are often difficulties in persuading people to testify in criminal trials - if they fear intimidation, for example. The prospect of a case being broadcast might be a further obstacle in this process. A committee set up in 1995 to evaluate a filming experiment in New York courts found that more than half of those surveyed said they would be less willing to testify if cameras were present. Eighty-seven per cent of trial and appellate judges surveyed in California reported that witnesses were more nervous or self- conscious when giving testimony before cameras.</p> <p>The impact of broadcasting on witnesses could be particularly acute where the witness is also the victim of the crime. Cameras could make the ordeal of going to court for victims much worse. In the work we have done about these issues, we have spoken to victims' and witnesses' support groups, and in general they are not in favour of the televising of evidence-giving. My strong inclination is that these and other considerations outweigh the benefits of public broadcasting of trials.</p> <p>Different considerations, though, apply to appeals. They rarely involve witnesses. Where they do, then broadcasting could still be prohibited. The argument for televising our appeal courts, though perhaps a less enticing prospect for broadcasters, seems to me a powerful one. </p> <p>These are all difficult and delicate issues. But the issues when parliament was considering whether to televise itself were also difficult. The process of reaching a decision took many tries, over many years. A generation ago, televising parliament was unthinkable. Now, in an age of 24-hour, multi-channel, worldwide TV coverage, not having parliament televised seems equally unthinkable. </p> <p>As well as the consultation document we will be producing, we will help consider the questions surrounding cameras in the courts with a further initiative: a limited move, agreed with the judiciary, to pilot selective filming in the appeal courts: not for use, but to give all those involved the chance to see how filming will work in practice, and how film taken in court might be used in news reports and documentaries. </p> <p>Creating a supreme court puts the issue of televising the courts in England and Wales for the first time into the public domain. We have a responsibility to consider it properly. So we will mount a proper and thorough examination of all the issues involved. </p> <p>Others, including the broadcasters who are keen to see their cameras in our courtrooms, will no doubt air a wide range of views. My job is to mount a searching consideration of the idea, and to detail our findings, including looking at the number of examples of televising the courts all around the world - Australia, New Zealand, Canada, as well as the US. Many show a subtle and variegated approach to the issue. </p> <p>Televising the courts doesn't have to be a simple, light-switch decision: television, yes or no. In the US, televising the courts varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, state to state, county to county, even case to case. Televising the courts doesn't have to produce CourtTV. But whatever the debate, our watchword will be clear. Justice should be seen to be done. But the priority must be that justice is done. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Lord Falconer is secretary of state for constitutional affairs and lord chancellor</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dca.gov.uk\">www.dca.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>When I interviewed Courtney Love in Seattle in late 1992, she fixated for a moment on a copy of a Janis Joplin biography. \"This is the sort of biography I want written about me,\" she said, picking it up. \"I want to read out the first sentence, OK? 'I was stark naked, stoned out of my mind on heroin and the girl lying between my legs was Janis Joplin.' \" She paused for breath, looking in amazement at the first page of Peggy Casserta's Going Down With Janis. \"This Joplin book is insanely graphic, you know, all abscesses, butt-sex, heroin this, cocaine that. I can't believe she was like that.\" </p> <p>It takes a lot to shock Courtney Love. Even then, at the start of the 90s, the Hole singer-songwriter was no stranger to controversy herself. Yet even she was taken aback by the wild behaviour of a singer who had made her name over two decades previously. She also knew that, apart from the many stories about drugs, and about sex with men and women, Joplin is central to the story of women in rock; without her, Love and her female contemporaries might never have felt able to express themselves so freely. </p> <p>Joplin, who sang with a bluesy soulfulness previously unheard of in a white woman, confounded stereotypes from the start. She grew up in Texas in the 50s, at a time when women performers were not encouraged to write their own material, and when the pressure to look and be \"feminine\" was acute. In the mid-60s, when she found a niche for herself in the hippy counterculture of San Francisco, the Supremes were still wearing spangly gowns and smiling sweetly. </p> <p>The first major female solo singer to emerge after Aretha Franklin, Joplin was one of the few successful women in a very male world of dope and drink, guitars and groupies. Often, she saw no option but to behave in a male way while trying not to lose her identity as a woman; she knew no other way of being accepted. As a teenager, she had hung out with a mostly male gang of friends, and had an embarrassing propensity for shouting out, \"Well, fuck you baby!\" </p> <p>Her role model was Bessie Smith, widely agreed to be the greatest female blues singer ever. Smith lived fast, drank hard and died relatively young, in a car crash in 1937, aged 43. Joplin once told Rolling Stone journalist David Dalton that she \"never sang rock'n'roll, I sang blues - Bessie Smith kind of blues\". In 1970, shortly before she died, she put up half the money to buy a proper tombstone for Smith's grave in Philadelphia. </p> <p>Joplin began her career performing in clubs while she was attending the University of Texas in Austin. Shortly after being voted the \"Ugliest Man on Campus\" by her fellow students, she left for San Francisco. There, in the hippy enclave of Haight Ashbury, she hung out with the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. She joined a band, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and her moment finally came in the summer of 1967, when the band performed twice at the first Monterey Festival and secured a major record deal. The following autumn their first album, Cheap Thrills, went straight to number 1 in the American charts, and stayed there for eight weeks. </p> <p>But Joplin was restless. At the end of 1968, she left Big Brother to go solo. She was beginning to show signs of paranoia. She worried that journalists were more interested in her lifestyle than in her music; she felt she had a role to play both off and on stage. \"It's not easy living up to Janis Joplin, you know,\" she once said. </p> <p>She knew it was a game, a way of fitting in, but she didn't always enjoy playing the part: \"Maybe my audiences can enjoy my music more if they think I'm destroying myself.\" Sometimes she wanted to be herself, claiming, \"I'm just a 50s chick.\" By the time she reached Woodstock in 1969, it was clear she was struggling to hold it together; she had developed a heroin habit that made her a pale imitation of her former self. </p> <p>In the spring of 1970, she formed a new band, the Full Tilt Boogie Band. She started to call herself \"Pearl\". She stopped taking heroin. But her reputation went before her: some venues refused to book her, worried about her abusive language on stage and the rowdy audiences she drew. In September, Joplin and her band went into a Los Angeles studio to record a new album. She had started to use heroin again. On October 4 1970, after a hard night's drinking with her band, Joplin went back to her room at the Landmark Hotel and died of a heroin overdose. She was just 27. </p> <p>Shortly before her premature death, in the summer of 1970, Joplin performed at a series of festivals across Canada. With the Grateful Dead, The Band, Sha-Na-Na and others, she travelled from Toronto to Calgary on a train that became known as the Festival Express. This week sees the release of a documentary about the tour: a film crew joined the train and shot around 60 hours of material over five days, which has now been edited and augmented with commentary from surviving band members, organisers and journalists. Directed by British film-maker Bob Smeaton, who won Grammys for his documentaries The Beatles Anthology and Band of Gypsys: Live at the Fillmore East (about Jimi Hendrix), it is an extraordinary film, and the footage of Joplin is particularly strong, whether close-ups of her singing with abandon on tiny stages just a few feet from the audience, or scenes of her hanging out with other musicians, most of them men, on the train. </p> <p>She clearly has the respect of everyone around her. After her death, Jerry Garcia, late singer of the Grateful Dead, remembered: \"Janis was a real person. She was just like the rest of us - fucked up, strung out, in weird places. She was doing what she was doing as hard as she could, which is as much as any of us can do.\" </p> <p>\"Janis was great on camera,\" Smeaton says. \"A natural. She looks very modern. We interviewed a lot of guys on the train who knew her personally. They said she was one of the guys, but she was very much a woman. She could drink with the best of them, but she pretty much stayed in control. There's a great scene where she's sitting with Jerry Garcia and Rick Danko [bass player in The Band] and she's the leader, the boss. She knew exactly what she wanted and she went out and got it.\" </p> <p>But perhaps the most striking aspect of the film is how relaxed and happy Joplin looks. David Dalton, who was writing a story for Rolling Stone that summer and spent a long time shadowing Joplin, talks of the great atmosphere on board the train. \"It was a reunion for everyone who had been around Haight Ashbury in late 1966. Back then it was a very communal society, no one had any money; they were drug-taking crazy visionaries. Janis was in her element. The folk scene has always been kinder to female singers; it's more accepting of women than the rock world.\" </p> <p>Dalton says that Joplin took some getting used to. He remembers going into the Rolling Stones' dressing room with her when they played Madison Square Garden. \"They all blanched. She was too much for them. Here was a latter-day Bessie Smith! We actually seem to encourage female rap stars to be outrageous today, but Janis was pretty intimidating. She always had an impact on a room. People say she wasn't very attractive, and maybe she put on weight, developed bad skin in the heroin years, but when I first saw her in late '66, she was your absolute wet dream. She was very hot.\" </p> <p>Joplin had a reputation as a bohemian, an intellectual, and she never felt the need to hide her middle-class roots; she was happy to sit and talk about books, films and life. Dalton thinks she may have spent too much time thinking. \"She was very reflective. She was maybe too smart, too introspective. She ruminated about everything. But while she was fragile and vulnerable, she was also fearless. She'd go into any bar, even alone. She was certainly more fearless than her band.\" </p> <p>At the time of her death, Joplin was engaged to Seth Morgan, a former drug dealer who later killed himself and another girlfriend in a motorbike accident. She wanted to settle down, to be looked after. She was happy with the album she was recording - the vital, passionate Pearl, which was released posthumously. In other words, she was in a happy place. Dalton says she never talked of suicide or death; he always imagined her growing old, sitting on a rocking chair on a porch with hens running around her. </p> <p>But Country Joe McDonald, a musician who went out with Joplin in San Francisco, says he has always believed she was a victim of her gender. \"Sexism killed her. Everybody wanted this sexy chick who sang really sexy and had lots of energy. People kept saying she was just 'one of the guys': that's a real sexist bullshit trap, cos that was fuckin' her head around. She was one of the women. She was a strong, groovy woman. Smart, you know? But she got fucked around.\" </p> <p>While Joplin may have become rock's first female casualty, her legacy lives on. Although she may not be cited as an influence as often as, say, Patti Smith, without Joplin there might have been no blues-punk from Polly Harvey, no teen blues from Joss Stone, and no \"odd\" or eccentric behaviour from the likes of Bj\u00f6rk or Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor. </p> <p>And it seems that her time may be coming again: Renee Zellweger is due to start filming a Joplin biopic, Piece of my Heart, before the end of the year. Nothing, though, can match the power of the real thing, of watching her perform live. As Bob Smeaton says: \"She proved you could survive as a woman in the rock'n'roll business. They may not realise it, but all of the women performing today were given a doorway into rock'n'roll by what Janis Joplin achieved.\"</p>",
  "The French government today refused to bow to the demands of militants who have kidnapped two French journalists in Iraq, insisting that a law banning Muslim headscarves in school would go ahead. <p>Government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope told Canal Plus television that France would not compromise its values to win the release of the journalists. Militants claiming to hold them demanded the law be overturned within 48 hours, a deadline that expires later today. </p> <p>\"The law will be applied,\" Mr Cope said, rejecting the militants' warning. </p> <p>The law, which bans all religious symbolism from state schools, goes into effect when classes resume this week. The ban on \"conspicuous\" religious apparel includes Jewish yarmulkas and Christian crosses as well. However, the most visible result of the law will be an end to Muslim girls wearing headscarves. </p> <p>The two journalists, Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, were last heard from on August 19, just before heading from Baghdad to the southern city of Najaf. Mr Chesnot works for Radio France-Internationale and Radio France and Mr Malbrunot for RTL radio and the dailies Le Figaro and Ouest-France. </p> <p>In a video broadcast by the Arabic TV station, al-Jazeera, on Saturday, militants calling themselves the Islamic Army of Iraq demanded France revoke the law banning head scarves in public schools, calling it \"an aggression on the Islamic religion and personal freedoms\". </p> <p>They gave no ultimatum, al-Jazeera said. The station showed a brief tape of the journalists saying they were in captivity, the first word on their fate since they disappeared. </p> <p>A militant group with a similar name to the one holding the French journalists is believed to be responsible for the death last week of Italian freelance journalist Enzo Baldoni. Prior to his murder, the group had said it could not guarantee his safety unless Italy announced within 48 hours that it would withdraw its troops from Iraq. </p> <p>The French president, Jacques Chirac, vowed yesterday to spare no effort to secure the reporters' freedom and dispatched the foreign minister, Michel Barnier, to the Middle East. He arrived in Cairo, Egypt early today for meetings with Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit and with Amr Moussa, secretary-general of the Arab League. </p> <p>In July, Egyptian diplomacy secured the release of one of Cairo's diplomats in Baghdad, Mohammed Mamdouh Helmi Qutb, held by militants for three days. </p> <p>Speaking at the French embassy in Cairo, Mr Barnier did not address the militants' demand but said: \"This ultimatum is incomprehensible, given the reality of French society.\" Mr Barnier also planned to visit Qatar, his office in Paris said. </p> <p>Mr Chirac appealed yesterday to the kidnappers, implicitly reminding them that France opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq. </p> <p>\"France ensures equality, the respect and protection of the free practicing of all religions,\" a solemn-looking Mr Chirac said in a televised address. \"These values of respect and tolerance inspire our actions everywhere in the world ... They also inspired France's policy in Iraq.\" </p> <p>Insurgents in Iraq have kidnapped dozens of people in their campaign to drive out coalition forces and hamper reconstruction, demanding that the hostages' nations pull their troops out of Iraq if coalition members, or that foreign companies end operations there. </p> <p>Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, said the hostage crisis showed France cannot escape terrorists with a passive Iraq policy and the fight against terrorism has to be global. </p> <p>\"France will not be spared - no more than Italy, Spain, or Egypt,\" Mr Allawi said in an interview published today in Le Monde newspaper. \"Governments that decide to remain on the defensive will be the next targets of terrorist ...

  "<p>When I was a young girl I dreamed of having a red dress. Well, I might have done, and if I didn't then it makes the link between me, Babs and Margaret in the tail end of the book even more tenuous than it is already. So let's just say I did. </p> <p>While I was alive I wrote four accounts of my strange marriage to the crown prince of Korea. Now I have been dead for 200 years I am keen to set the record straight. You might think that I merely wish to be self-serving, but having spent the passing centuries in continuous psychotherapy I believe I am now in a position to tell the truth. But you must be the final judge. </p> <p>My wedding took place when I was 10. I say that my husband was mad, and so I believe he was, though much of the blame must go to his father, King Yong-jo. My father-in-law was a hard taskmaster and nothing my husband, Prince Sado, did would ever please him. </p> <p>Our first son died and I mourned him greatly, but our second son, Prince Chong-jo, prospered and I dedicated my life to him. </p> <p>Sado's madness first became apparent when he could never decide what to wear, and would frequently slash his clothes. As time went on, he indulged his taste for killing: first he murdered his mistress and then he took his anger out on eunuchs and courtesans. </p> <p>These were dangerous times for everyone and death was commonplace, so I tried to understand my husband's behaviour. In my simplistic, transcultural analysis, I concluded that if his father had loved him more, Sado would have been perfect. Yong-jo did not see it this way and locked Sado up in a rice chest for 10 days till he died. Our son was distraught, but recovered to become king when Yong-jo died. I merely became a sad old lady looking for someone to tell my tale. </p> <p>Babs Halliwell, too, has a son who died young, a husband who is mad and wants a red dress. She has been anonymously sent a parcel containing the story of the princess. Could it have been from her ghost? She is on her way to a conference in South Korea and finds herself drawn to the princess. Once in Seoul, she begins a secret three-day affair with the great sociologist Jan van Jost. He buys her a lacquered cabinet and tells her that he has put down a deposit to adopt a Chinese girl. As they prepare to part, he has a heart attack and dies. </p> <p>On her return to London, no one believes that Babs has had an affair with the great Van Jost, until she flies to Spain to meet his widow and together they both agree to bring up Chen Jianyi, the Chinese adoptee. Chen Jianyi wants a red dress, too, and grows up to be very clever. One day, she and Babs meet Margaret Drabble, who also once wanted a red dress. They tell her about the princess and the tale is done. </p> <p><strong> The digested read ... digested</strong><br> </p> <p> The Red Queen dies a second death at the hands of Madge</p>",
  "<p>Just what we needed after the Olympics: a lengthy Greek drama dominating the schedules. <strong> The Odyssey</strong> (Radio 4) even had three heats, with instalments of Simon Armitage's dramatisation spread over Saturday and Sunday. It was, thanks to Janet McTeer's silk-voiced Athena, immediately gripping stuff, with her controversially crying to Zeus, her father, that \"there's no shame in being human\" just as he grumbled about the many foibles of mere mortals. The mortal in question is Odysseus, floundering at sea after 20 years away from his wife, Penelope, and now, finally, given the chance to return home. </p> <p>What Armitage brought most emphatically to the play was a very real sense of two worlds - the godly and the human - and the interplay between them. The mortals were like puppets, but not so that their anguish and pain didn't feel real to us. The gods, especially Zeus, felt omnipotent and haughty (\"Zeus has spoken: all the gods shall agree\"), but were also fully rounded characters. Having shown no interest in the farewell scene between Odysseus and Calypso - Odysseus has spent many a year trapped as her plaything - Zeus finally looks on and is then enthralled, watching with Athena as if it's a slushy romantic film. \"Will he turn and wave?\" Zeus asks, with soppy hope in his voice. \"It seems not,\" Athena replies. </p> <p>This Odyssey never felt stodgy or antique. In fact, occasionally, the language seemed too modern, and too televisual (when Odysseus's son Telemachus says that people tell him \"how sorry they were to hear of my loss\", I thought the gods had transported us momentarily to NYPD Blue), but mostly it invigorated the classic with linguistic dexterity and inventiveness that was subtly done. I loved Odysseus recalling at one point that \"the rest of us skedaddled in the boats\". </p> <p>Odysseus always knew that his fate was <strong> Not About Luck</strong> (Sunday, Radio 3). So too does Sandra Newman, a novelist who spent a year working as a professional casino blackjack player. Trawling through literary representations of gambling, Newman told their authors in pithy fashion how it really was. \"Total balderdash,\" is her verdict on Ian Fleming, while James Ellroy's evocative descriptions in The Cold Six Thousand gets a reality check: \"The majority of players now are pensioners, invariably clad in shell suits.\" </p> <p>The novels were fun, but I could have heard much more about Newman's own adventures. She would look at players and see that \"it must require some masochism to seek out a game that's rigged against you and call it entertainment\". But when you win thousands, she explained, \"all the statistics you've studied mean nothing. You believe willy-nilly in the favour of the gods.\" So too did Odysseus. Eventually.</p>",

  "Everything that could possibly have been tried in Chechnya has been. It has been invaded and the capital Grozny retaken, twice. It has been allowed to exist as a de facto independent state. It has been ruled directly from Moscow. Three of the last four Chechens to hold the title of president have been assassinated - two by the Russians, and one by Chechen rebels - and the fourth is in hiding. The rebel movement has been split and turned against itself. Russian forces have used collective punishment, summary execution, torture, rape, kidnap, extortion and terror to pacify a brutalised population, and nothing works. Chechnya has been conscripted into George Bush's war on terror, and the west has been silent. But however many times the war has been declared over by Moscow, it plainly isn't. <p>Yesterday another election was staged and a fifth president, Alu Alkhanov, installed. His main rival was struck off the election ballot on a technicality. Mr Alkhanov will only provide temporary relief to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The clan Moscow has backed, armed Chechens loyal to Ramzan Kadyrov, the 27-year-old son of the last president, are corrupt thugs incapable of providing war-weary Chechens with the law and order they crave. They are, on the other hand, quite capable of letting through their roadblocks the next squad of rebel attackers to seize Grozny or neighbouring Nazran in Ingushetia - if the price is right. </p> <p>Without sacrificing its claims to sovereignty over a small mountain land, Russia is surely capable of devising a strategy which does not involve another decade of murder and terror. It would involve identifying authoritative Chechen leaders with whom to negotiate a ceasefire, and being prepared to invite in international organisations like the OSCE to help provide security. Chechnya did not start as a land filled with Russian-hating Muslim jihadists. It attached itself to al-Qaida's wagon, not simply because the Wahhabis had more money than the more moderate arm of Chechen separatism, but also because of the brutal tactics Russia employed.</p>",
  "<p>A succession of recent investigations and financial penalties levied by the Financial Services Authority has put the term \"market abuse\" on the lips of many commentators and, if the reaction to the \u00a317m fine imposed on Shell this week is any indication, on the minds of company directors. </p> <p>One could be forgiven for believing market abuse was rife in the City. Is this an overreaction? After all, the UK financial markets are world leaders. Surely this wouldn't be the case if market abuse was rife? Thankfully, market abuse is not widespread, partly because most practitioners are decent people but also because the FSA takes a tough stance with those who do play fast and loose with the rules, no matter how big or small. </p> <p>While one team at the FSA was looking into Shell's misstatements of its proved reserves, another was completing action against one Michael Davies, financial controller of an Ofex company, who was fined \u00a31,000 for share dealing using advance knowledge of his firm's results. </p> <p>One driver for all the interest is that the offence of market abuse is relatively new. The concept, and the FSA's powers to tackle it, were created by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and came into force less than three years ago. </p> <p>There are three strands of market abuse. One is the misuse of information, which involves using information not generally available but normally disclosed to the market. Giving a false or misleading im pression to the market is a second strand. The third is distorting the market through interference with the normal process of share prices moving up and down in accordance with supply and demand. </p> <p>Although not all investigations lead to enforcement, to date the FSA has exercised its powers in two of these three strands. As well as Michael Davies, two others have been fined for misuse of information: Peter Bracken, who was group head of communications at a listed company, was fined \u00a315,000, and Robert Middlemiss, a company secretary, was also fined \u00a315,000. </p> <p>Three lessons can be learned from these cases. First, the FSA can apply its powers to any of the UK's prescribed markets. Cases have involved trades on Ofex, Aim and the market in listed securities. Second, the FSA can and does take action regardless of the size of the profit made. Third, the number of people with access to inside information should be restricted to minimise the chances of misuse, but those who do have access must act responsibly. </p> <p>The FSA's action against Shell is the first example of punishing a company for market abuse by creating a false and misleading impression. On January 9 2004, when Shell first publicly revealed that it had misstated its reserves, the company's market capitalisation fell by\u00a32.9bn. </p> <p>Shell's action was made more serious because false or misleading announcements on reserves were made from 1998 to 2003. Even though Shell had indications and warnings from 2000 to 2003 that figures for proved reserves were incorrect, its actions continued. </p> <p>The \u00a317m penalty, by far the biggest imposed by the FSA, is a reflection of the seriousness of Shell's misconduct and the impact the actions had on markets and shareholders. The penalty could have been larger had Shell not cooperated fully with the FSA investigation. Enforcement as a form of deterrent is far more effective when the FSA is able to work with market participants. The FSA will continue to give credit where it is due to those who recognise the benefit of the collective responsibility of the financial community. </p> <p>Distortion is the only strand that the FSA has not taken public disciplinary action against. This is probably because this type of abuse is not as common and hard evidence of distortion is relatively rare. The FSA does, however, investigate potential distortion cases and it is likely to be only a matter of time before a penalty is imposed for interfering with the normal processes of share price movement. </p> <p>What can be expected next? </p> <p>Next year will see the introduction of the market abuse directive, EU legislation that attempts to harmonise market conduct rules. It will not change the FSA's policy on what is and what is not market abuse in the UK. However, greater international cooperation is anticipated, and investigations could span a number of jurisdictions. The Shell case is an example of this happening: the investigation was conducted in parallel with the securities and exchange commission in the US and the Dutch authorities. Cooperation between these authorities was excellent. </p> <p>One thing that won't occur is a lowering of the FSA's guard. An FSA statutory objective is to maintain Britain's reputation for efficient, clean and fair markets, and there is a host of independent research confirming that this is being achieved. So there will continue to be investigations into suspicious activities and firm action taken. It may be that the recent run of cases has brought the issue to the fore but keeping the lid on market abuse is not a passing fashion. It is central to the success of our financial market place. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Hector Sants is managing director of wholesale and institutional markets at the Financial Services Authority</p>",
  "<p>British Airways is launching an inquiry into last week's chaos at Heathrow airport which left hundreds of passengers stranded and further tarnished the carrier's reputation. </p> <p>Chief executive Rod Eddington is personally heading the postmortem and speculation is rife that it could cost the jobs of senior executives including the man responsible for maintaining operations at London's busiest airport. </p> <p>\"After this weekend I will review what happened,\" Mr Eddington said. \"It will be a very thorough investigation and the action appropriate. I will take tough decisions if neces sary but I'm not flying into decisions.\" </p> <p>Early estimates are that the disruption cost the airline upwards of \u00a35m. </p> <p>Staff, who had to deal with irate passengers, are to be rewarded with free flights. About 17,500 employees, from baggage handlers and check-in staff to engineers will be offered a pair of free tickets to any destination for use over the next 18 months. </p> <p>The cost of the ticket giveaway has been estimated at \u00a34m, although BA last night refused to give figures. </p> <p>The chaos at Heathrow was caused by a combination of thunderstorms, restrictions on night flights, staff sick leave and a delay in recruiting new employees. The airline was forced to cancel up to 100 flights and delay many more. </p> <p>Yesterday, as services returned to some semblance of normality, just three round trips were cancelled, with passengers moved to other flights or other carriers. The affected flights were from Heathrow to New York, Oslo and Zurich. </p> <p>Mike Street, BA's director of customer services and operations, has been tipped as being in the firing line of the inquiry. His position was bolstered last week by his success in securing a last-minute pay deal which prevented a strike. </p> <p>Mervyn Walker, UK airports director, and Peter Read, Heathrow operations director, are seen as under pressure.</p>",
  "The Taliban claimed responsibility for a car bomb that ripped through Kabul yesterday. The Afghan government said two Americans, three Nepalese and two Afghans were killed in what was the largest attack for months in the Afghan capital. <p>A further 10 people, nine of them children, were killed in a separate bombing in southern Afghanistan at the weekend, marking a serious escalation in violence in the run up to October's presidential election. </p> <p>The Kabul bomb exploded in the late afternoon in front an office occupied by Dyncorp, a private firm that protects interim Afghan president Hamid Karzai, and which also works for the US government in Iraq. </p> <p>The explosion, which a Taliban official said had been triggered by a remote-controlled device, shook rush-hour Kabul at about 5.40pm, shattering windows half a mile away. Smoke billowed from the building as emergency services rushed to the scene. Plain-clothes US soldiers car rying submachine guns cordoned off the area with the help of Afghan police. </p> <p>At the blast site several vehicles stood destroyed in front of a gutted building. One badly charred vehicle was overturned close to a metre-deep crater in the centre of the road, which appeared to mark the detonation point. A witness, Abdul Jalil, wearing a bloodstained tunic and with a bandage on his face, stumbled from the scene with the help of Afghan police officers. </p> <p>He had been working in the building next door when the bomb went off, he said. </p> <p>\"I was sitting on a chair waiting for office hours to finish. There was an explosion, and a big fire in front of the American and British house. Then I saw some seriously injured foreigners running from their office.\" </p> <p>The interior minister, Ali Ahmad Jalali, visited the scene of the explosion an hour later. At that time he said he knew that least four people had been killed and two injured. </p> <p>\"Terrorists are behind this action,\" he said, but refused to speculate on which group was responsible, saying only: \"Terrorists are terrorists. That's their identity.\" </p> <p>Mr Jalali said the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) and the Afghan police had started investigations into the explosion. A Taliban spokesman told Reuters that the device had been detonated by remote control. </p> <p>Reporters saw the badly mutilated body of a man lying in the street before Afghan police and foreign security guards pushed them back at gunpoint. Residents said a boy living in a neighbouring house and a cobbler whose stall was blown away by the blast were also killed, and up to eight others wounded. </p> <p>The second attack happened in Naiknam, a village in Paktia province, 80 miles south of Kabul, on Saturday night when a blast ripped through a religious school. The provincial governor, Haji Assadullah Wafa, said the explosion was caused by a mine laid by the Taliban, who are fighting US troops in the area. </p> <p>\"They don't want Afghan children to study and participate in the future reconstruction of their country,\" Mr Wafa told the Guardian. The school had received funding from the International Rescue Committee, an American aid agency, he added. </p> <p>The Taliban have vowed to disrupt Afghanistan's forthcoming presidential election on October 9, which the interim president Mr Karzai is favoured to win. </p> <p>Mr Wafa said the Taliban were still using Pakistan as a rear base, despite promises from the Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, that he would stop them. \"Taliban fugitives receive logistical support in Pakistan and then cross the border to plot against the security and stability of Afghanistan,\" he said. </p> <p>As night fell in Kabul the police carried a body wrapped in black plastic on a stretcher from the scene of the blast. US special forces used sniffer dogs and torches to search the surrounding area for possible secondary explosives. </p> <p>\"This was a big one,\" said one gun-wielding plain-clothes soldier standing near by.</p>",
  "At the closing ceremony of the Athens Olympic games last night Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, issued the traditional invitation to \"the youth of the world\" to reassemble in four years' time. <p>Athletes who were either in the stadium or watching and dreaming at home will be sustained until 2008 by the prospect of Olympic glory in Beijing. </p> <p>But for Mr Rogge and the movement he leads the road to the Chinese capital promises to be a rocky one. </p> <p>The decision to take the games to the world's most populous country may have gone down well with the sponsors and broadcasters who fund the greatest show on Earth, but it has ensured a torrent of criticism from politicians and protesters concerned about human rights abuses in China. </p> <p>Athens saw protests from the Free Tibet Campaign and others in response to reports that the authorities in Beijing had arrested a number of Catholics and Buddhists during the first week of the games. </p> <p>A \"Free Tibet\" banner was unfurled during a diving final last weekend and activist groups, including the World Uyghur Congress, which speaks for people in East Turkestan, and Olympic Watch, which monitors the IOC's ethical stance, called for a silent protest when the Olympic flag was handed over to the Chinese delegation last night. </p> <p>Erkin Alptekin, president of the WUC, said: \"The Olympic flag symbolises peace, harmony and solidarity among various nations. Athens is the source of democracy, rule of law and human rights. </p> <p>\"For the last 50 years, how ever, Beijing has been turned into a centre of oppression, arbitrary arrest and execution.\" </p> <p>The Beijing games would be a nightmare for thousands of Uyghurs, Tibetans and Chinese dissidents, he said. </p> <p>\"Because, under the pretext of 'security', the Chinese leaders are preparing themselves to detain, torture and even execute hundreds of Uyghurs, Tibetans and Chinese dissidents during the Olympic games in 2008.\" </p> <p>Speaking before the closing ceremony, Mr Rogge said the IOC was in full support of human rights, and the Chinese themselves had acknowledged that the games would help change their society. </p> <p>\"The IOC is always in favour of maximum application of human rights,\" he said. \"We have clearly said that the position of the IOC is that human rights should be respected in full. But it is not up to the IOC to monitor human rights, we are not inspectors.\" </p> <p>The 2008 games offer the sponsoring multinationals an unprecedented opportunity to penetrate China's vast emerging market. And to the Chinese they will be a huge vehicle for national pride. </p> <p>Yesterday Chinese athletes in Athens received a message of thanks from Beijing for a record display which had secured 31 gold medals by yesterday morning. </p> <p>\"The motherland is proud of you, and the people are proud of you,\" the state council (cabinet) said. </p> <p>\"The excellent performance by China's athletes again shows the spirit of the Chinese nation's unremitting efforts to improve itself ...

  "Two South Africans acquitted by a Zimbabwean court of charges related to the alleged coup plot in Equatorial Guinea are to be questioned today by the South African authorities. <p>Harry Carlse and Lourens Horn were cleared of trying to buy weapons in Zimbabwe when their British leader, Simon Mann, was convicted. They were freed on Saturday and flew back to South Africa. They will be questioned by the Scorpions investigation unit in Pretoria, which arrested Sir Mark Thatcher last week. </p> <p>Their lawyer said they expected to be charged under the South African law against mercenary activities. \"They will go to the Scorpions offices in Pretoria for questioning about possible contravention of the Foreign Military Assistance Act,\" Alwyn Griebenow said. </p> <p>They are among the 66 suspects cleared by a Zimbabwean magistrate on Friday of weapons offences. The 64 others face penalties for immigration offences and remain in jail. Simon Mann, who admitted trying to buy weapons, could face a 10-year jail sentence. </p> <p>Mr Carlse and Mr Horn alleged that they had been tortured in jail.

  "<p>In the same way that the upper classes classified people throughout their lives as Eton or Harrow, Oxford or Cambridge, television actors tend to be stamped with an alma mater. Performers such as John Thaw (Sweeney &amp; Morse) and David Jason (Del Boy &amp; Frost) are unusual in managing a double affiliation. Most actors are shackled in the public mind to one academy: Martin Shaw has never quite outrun The Professionals, Tom Baker is confined to the Tardis. </p> <p>By a scheduling coincidence, this week sees a triple graduation ceremony from Men Behaving Badly. Three of the stars created by that series - Neil Morrissey, Martin Clunes and Caroline Quentin - are starting new parts. Preventing the critic's equivalent of a bingo full house, the other member of the quartet - Leslie Ash - is sadly unavailable for casting, recovering from injuries and then illness which she has attributed to a fall during energetic sex with her husband, Lee Chapman. </p> <p>Post-hit projects are a difficult problem for an actor. They owe the new role to the old show and the audience will be drawn by memories of the previous programme. Yet no one wants to wear the same shirt every year and, while viewers welcome familiarity in a performer, the profession admires distinction. So an actor has to decide how different to be. </p> <p>Neil Morrissey, in two senses, stayed close to the Men Behaving Badly mould. Carrie and Barry is another half-hour sitcom and written by the MBB creator, Simon Nye. Morrissey's character is also essentially a theoretically grown-up version of the Tony he played in the earlier show: an idle lad who relies on bursts of wheedling charm to prevent women guessing at the extent of his laddish appetites. </p> <p>Barry is a cabbie married to Carrie but with a teenage daughter from a previous relationship. The comedy is usually bodily: the men discuss shags and wanks. During a hot-tub sex scene, the soundtrack leads us to believe that Barry has farted until we realise that the ring-tone of his phone consists of belches. The tone is more dirty than 9pm BBC1 has generally been, although it's a slight problem for Nye that the erotic sitcom Coupling has come between Men Behaving Badly and this. As is often the case in his writing, the pleasure is in unexpected grace-notes: a woman left weeping on her front step later says she has been using leaves as hankies. </p> <p>The plot is also startling to readers of the tabloid press. Carrie suffers a black eye which she insists was an accident but their friends all assume Barry has hit her. This dilemma mirrors the difficulty Leslie Ash and Lee Chapman have had in getting some newspapers to believe how bruising loving marital sex can be. This storyline is probably just a coincidence but you wonder if, though Carrie and Barry features only one acting graduate of Men Behaving Badly, Nye's script has Ash in mind in a different way. </p> <p>While Morrissey more or less plays Tony's brother, Martin Clunes has been keen to escape the fame that Gary brought him. The actor was understandably exasperated when a fine National Theatre performance as the hypocritical cleric in Tartuffe was widely headlined Monk Behaving Badly. Perhaps in reaction, Clunes next played on television the impeccably well-mannered Mr Chips. </p> <p>And, in Doc Martin, his new six-part comedy drama, Clunes again chooses a character who invites no possible comparison to a laddish flatmate. Dominic Minghella's script imagines Martin Ellingham, a London surgeon, downshifting to Cornwall where he takes a post as GP in a village where his predecessor let the locals write their own prescriptions. </p> <p>Viewers anticipating (in my case, fearing) a new Peak Practice are given several gentle misunderstandings between the yokels and the newly arrived sobersides but may be surprised by the opening storyline. A retired colonel and a young lad are developing breasts. There's some muttering about the local water supply, raising the possibility of a Cornwall version of Ibsen's An Enemy of the People. </p> <p>In fact, the eventual explanation more resembles one of Roald Dahl's gleefully gynaecological short stories for adults: the GP pursues the possibility that a female patient is passing on to men during intercourse the oestrogen cream she uses for vaginal dryness. Scriptwriters for Holby City may need hospital treatment after kicking themselves for missing a bizarre medical possibility. </p> <p>With the sea in the background of every scene, Cornwall deserves an award for best-supporting actor and Clunes convinces as a stiff, middle-aged man, although his seriousness here distractingly reminds us that he is born to play Andrew Marr in Hutton: The Movie. </p> <p>Among the MBB graduates, Caroline Quentin has shown the most convincing ability to transport her millions of viewers from part to part: achieving two more hits in Jonathan Creek and Life Begins. </p> <p>Key to her success has been a willingness to play ageing roles and, in the one-off drama Von Trapped, she's Maria, a middle-aged single mother who is obsessed with The Sound of Music to the extent of regularly performing karaoke versions of its songs. Her mother reassures her in a line typical of Jonathan Harvey's entertaining script, which comes across like a camper Alan Bennett: \"I saw the lederhosen had gone in the gusset so I Velcroed in some chamois leather.\" </p> <p>Maria's secret dream is to go to Salzburg, while her androgynous daughter Lee has a secret which she feels would be a nightmare to her family. A comedy of transformations - luck takes Maria to Austria where her problems are solved - this is part of an occasional ITV1 series on the theme of being trapped but demonstrates the unusual extent to which Quentin has managed to escape the role that gave her the trappings of TV fame. </p> <p><strong>Good medicine</strong></p> <p>If this week's television were represented as a Venn diagram, apart from the overlapping between Clunes, Morrissey and Quentin, there would also be a shaded area between Doc Martin and another new medical comedy: Green Wing. </p> <p>The connection, though, extends to little more than that they touch on the same profession. If the HRT theme in Doc Martin is bold for ITV1 peak-time, it would seem mild in Green Wing, which takes its tone from the codes of late-night minority channel shows such as Nighty Night and Smack the Pony. The gang of actors and writers on this are from the latter show. </p> <p>The title is a typical cleverness. Green Wing immediately makes you think of a strange bird rather than the edge of an NHS hospital. Eight writers are credited and you imagine them all squabbling round a table until you guess that they separated and wrote segments: every scene is sketch-length, leading to a punchline which is generally mucky or surreal or both. </p> <p>A doctor comes into a room to find a buxom colleague weighing her breasts individually on the mailing scales. A woman wearing an eye-patch replies to the inevitable concerned request for explanations: \"I got a sperm in the eye.\" An employee speaking on the telephone with her head twisted sideways, summoning a mechanic to the printer urgently, is shown when the camera pulls out to have her long hair trapped in the machine. </p> <p>There is an appealing, almost Twin Peaks-like, feel to these scenes but the objection would be that there is no need for them to happen in a hospital. Other moments - junior doctors playing games of \"head-butt that sign\" as they walk down the corridor or \"name five famous lesbians\" during operations - counter that objection and prove that, even after Cardiac Arrest, Bodies and No Angels, hospitals are full of sick jokes.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Carrie &amp; Barry, Friday, BBC1; Doc Martin, Thursday, ITV1; Von Trapped, Sunday, ITV1; Green Wing, Friday, Channel 4</p>",
  "<p>A balcony on a balmy evening. A man and a woman. Something is in the air, but this is no Romeo and Juliet. For a start, the woman has a gun and she has already proved she can use it - on her husband's dog. American playwright John Patrick Shanley has never been able to repeat the success of his first play Danny and the Deep Blue Sea, although he has repeated himself both on stage and screen - he wrote the screenplay for Moonstruck - as he explored the Italian or Irish American male getting in touch with his heart. </p> <p>Here it is divorcee Huey and his friend Aldo who are trying to make sense of their feelings and their relationships with women. Huey has never got over his divorce from Janice and is suffering from depression, a desire to wear a beret and an inability to stop writing terrible poetry. Aldo has never got over his dad (who didn't love him) and his mother (who still does). So when Huey enlists Aldo's help in his reconciliation with Janice, it turns out to be an object lesson in love and affection for both men. </p> <p>Shanley makes some awkward gestures towards absurdism and some embarrassing attempts to break down the fourth wall, but at its heart this is old-fashioned romantic comedy with lots of tears and homespun truths as the characters try to deal with \"what was\" so they can move into the future. </p> <p>In a good production you might not notice all the therapy speak (\"I feel everything is over for me unless I get back and fix this broken place.\") and angst quite so much, but this is not good. Time passes slowly as the cast expend most of their energy on dodgy accents, very little on the performances and none at all on picking up cues. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until September 4.

  "The question that dogs Tony Blair at every turn reared up again in the extract from Greg Dyke's memoirs yesterday: either Blair misunderstood the 45-minute claim and was therefore incompetent, or he lied. As long as he dodges this question, its corrosive impact on his reputation and that of his government spreads. He is gambling that, in time, the question will fade, but that gamble is profoundly disrespectful of the democratic principles he is so keenly claiming to be exporting to Iraq. <p>This is one of the paradoxes which has troubled the thousands who have filled the tents of the Edinburgh Book Festival over the past couple of weeks. One theme has repeatedly cropped up in the programme and has attracted sell-out audiences: it can be summed up as \"the health of democracy in its heartlands of Britain and America\". </p> <p>The audiences that listen avidly and ask sharp questions are, as Neal Ascherson pointed out in his lecture on democracy, evidence that Britain has a more confident, assertive, educated, curious electorate than at probably any time in its history. The audience at the book festival has doubled in the past three years to just under 200,000. It has a vibrant appetite for debate and information, but it no longer necessarily turns to the political parties to meet it. Events such as those taking place beneath the tents in Charlotte Square over the past fortnight are a reminder that the much-discussed crisis of democracy, as evident in falling turnouts, is a crisis of faith rather than a crisis of participation. Apathy is not the issue; disillusionment is. </p> <p>In the US, that disillusionment is being driven by two issues, argued Michael Ignatieff last night in the last of a Royal Society of Arts series of lectures on democracy. First, the corrosive bitterness in American politics derives from the belief among many voters that the 2000 presidential election was stolen, and a fear that it could be again. (A bitterness evident on the streets of New York this weekend as big protests mark the opening of the Republican convention.) \"How can the greatest democracy in the world be so indifferent to the practice of democracy - something as simple as whether the voting machines are working properly?\" asked Ignatieff. </p> <p>Second, after Iraq (a war Ignatieff supported), he acknowledges that there are grave doubts about whether \"democracies can control the war-making powers of their executives\". The faulty intelligence and deliberate deception can only lead one to the conclusion that the \"entire leadership of the north Atlantic elite wilfully deluded themselves and then deceived the people\". A point echoed by Anthony Sampson in his lecture on the UK in the same series. </p> <p>What really concerns Ignatieff is that the Bush administration simply doesn't understand the democratic system it is constitutionally entrusted to defend. The use of torture has been the totemic issue: ruling out its use was a founding principle of American democracy. For the founding fathers, torture was for the despots of Europe; the new American state forbade the use of \"cruel and unusual punishments\" in its bill of rights. \"I'm a passionate lover of American democracy - a lot of my pessimism is disappointed love,\" concluded Ignatieff. </p> <p>So how could such a precious principle have been abandoned so lightly? The answer, of course, is fear. Underlying much of the thinking going on in Edinburgh was how fear can be used to acquire power. \"Fear stampedes electorates and parliaments. Fear is tremendously destructive of democracy - it's more damaging than terror,\" said Ignatieff, while Sampson, in another, equally grim analysis, argued that \"the fear of terrorism gave an obvious justification for secrecy, for ruthless action and, above all, for moving without democratic constraints\". </p> <p>The gloominess of these analyses in a sunny Edinburgh teeming with festival jollity is echoed in the weird, disturbing US film The Village. Making a pitch for the post-9/11 political allegory, it is a film which, despite its near-universal panning from the critics, lodges in the memory. The \"elders\" conjure up an elaborate myth of beasties laying siege to their community, which ensures a docile population. Their rule is largely benign but absolute. Pretty rural cottages, rows of cabbages and roaring log fires: it's a parody of the escape many already dream of. Its evocation of American rural pioneer life - Laura Ingalls Wilder meets Relocation, Relocation - is posing its US audience a question: is this the tightly controlled dystopia you want? </p> <p>What the thinkers in Edinburgh are pondering is how fear could stampede willing millions into just such a dystopia. The neocons offer just that. The problem, argued the philosopher John Gray in his talk here, is that the myth of progress which has sustained western liberalism for 200 years - the belief that the condition of human beings, ethically and politically, can be irrevocably improved - is crumbling. Two bogus versions of progress are being offered at the ballot box: in the US, the neocons are hijacking the myth of progress for their imperial project of an American century, while, in the UK, New Labour struggles to package its managerialist politics in the transformational progress rhetoric of the past. The electorate is rightly sceptical. </p> <p>For over a century, a belief in progress and faith in the state to deliver it have been the driving force of progressive politics, but both are losing their hold. The dangers of this belief in progress are becoming increasingly apparent. With progress comes a belief in your own superiority; progress can be used as a rationale for aggression and coercion - institutions have to be forced to \"modernise\"; countries have to be dragged into the 21st century; nations must be democratised (as if that could ever be a passive process). </p> <p>\"Why are you so pessimistic?\" a member of the audience asked Gray. \"I'm just saying the future will be just like the past - full of conflict. It's others who say that's pessimistic,\" he replied. Abandoning the belief in progress is the first step to becoming aware of the particular dangers our age faces - for example, how the progress myth can blind us to the re-emergence of old forms of cruelty, such as torture, or, most important, fuel the hubris of democratic, progressive power. Humility and a much better understanding of the limits of our power are what we need at this point in history, said Gray. </p> <p>None of these speakers were offering their audiences any relief from their anxieties. Their language was shocking and dramatic. I'm no intellectual historian, so I don't know if such pessimism of the intellect recurs every generation - but it seems that the anger in political life in the 80s and 90s has given way to something compelling, but very much bleaker. \"It's not my job to offer Prozac of the mind,\" an unrepentant Gray told his captivated audience. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Those of us whose stock in trade is words are well aware that the cardinal sin of that trade is to employ expressions that are well past their sell-by date.

Not without his airs and graces, Friedman is also not above being cliched himself: like many young Americans of his ilk, he counts Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead as a formative influence. As well as parading all the old favourites and the household names in the world of cliches, the site introduces a number of lesser known ones that will be sure to leave the mind boggling. For example, check out \"never challenge a skunk to a pissing duel\" - what's that all about? All credit to Friedman; his cliche-finder is, quite literally, a godsend.

  "<p>Tony Boyce applied for the job on the Wednesday. On the Sunday, he was told that he'd got it and that they would fly him over from Barbados to London to work on the next available bus: \"They were ready for me, but I wasn't ready for them.\" He was still at school, still living with his grandmother, and wasn't sure if she would cope by herself. That was 40 years ago, when the 60s were just beginning to swing. \"I was so excited,\" he says, \"especially when I saw the red buses from the air. People always talked about the red buses in London.\" On Friday, Tony will be made redundant, along with all his fellow conductors on the 73 route. On the same day, conductors on the number 9 and 390 Routemaster buses will also lose their jobs. By the end of next year, there will be no working Routemasters and no conductors left in London. The old jump-on, jump-off bus will be a thing of the past; a tourist attraction at best. </p> <p>Tony is leading me through Tottenham bus garage, home to the 73, and up the stairs to the canteen. He is tall and thin and elegant. \"I was brought up by my grandmother, and leaving her was quite a shock for me. She understood and told me to go, and said when I got here I could look after her back home. I sent money back home because my grandmother had looked after me, so it was my duty to look after her.\" </p> <p>It was a time of mass migration from the Caribbean to England - West Indians such as Tony were invited here to do blue-collar jobs on the buses and railways and in the national health service. \"They wanted us here for economic reasons because the people in England wouldn't do the jobs. That's why we were here.\" His mother was already in England, working in Birmingham, when he arrived. She was 38 years old, and had just had a baby with a new partner. </p> <p>It was only when he got here that he realised things were done differently in England. \"What surprised me most was on the first morning - I said good morning to everybody, and everybody looked at me as if to say, 'What are you doing?' That's our culture back home, to say good morning. Then I realised it wasn't the thing to do.\" He smiles and laughs. \"That was a big shock. But then again, England is a big country, and back home in Barbados you knew everybody.\" </p> <p>Does he think people ignored him because he was black? \"No, it was more cultural. But yes, of course I experienced some hostility. It has improved, but you still get the odd one. There's this guy, every time he gets on the bus he starts trouble with black people. Every time I get him I know he's going to upset some person. He's an older fella, and I'm surprised nobody has hit him. He told me last week I was a nigger and I was a coon.\" Did he tell the man to get off the bus? \"No, I think it's a mental problem. So you can't do that to a mental person, can you? And for that one person, you've got millions who are not racist, so that's the way I look at it.\" </p> <p>Tony has witnessed much change since he started on the buses. There was the social and sexual liberation of the 60s (\"It was the time of the miniskirt. That was something!\"), the industrial strife and three-day week of the 1970s, the austerity of the 1980s, Cool Britannia of the 1990s, and the irony of the 2000s - while six million people are now using London buses every day (up from 4.2 million four years ago), there is no place for conductors like him - according to Transport for London they are an anachronism. </p> <p>Tony has had a wonderful life on the buses. \"I love it, and the people love me too.\" There is always a tiny minority of troublemakers, but if anybody ever tries it on with him on the bus, his regulars will come to his rescue. In the end, he says, it comes down to respect and love. \"To me there's no difference between a baby in your arms and an old lady who's got a stick: to me me they all need respect, and that is what I will give. If one person upsets you, don't take it out on the next person who comes along. You have to treat everybody as individuals, and if you can't, you have problems. On my bus, most people, if they are sad when they get on, they will get off happy. I smile with them.\" </p> <p>He nurses his mug of tea in his big hands. I ask him how he cheers people up. He struggles to explain. \"I can't do it right now, it's impromptu. I can just make people laugh when they are sad. I remember one man, who was so sad, and when he got off the bus he was the happiest man. All his muscles in his face lit up with joy, and when he got off he said, 'I've never met a person like you.' That's the main thing people will miss me for - making them smile. People have cried when I've told them we're leaving.\" He pauses, sups his tea. \"Yessssssss!\" he says contemplatively. </p> <p>Has he any plans for the future? Well, he says, he's 60 years old, so he thinks he deserves a break. \"I don't think I will look for much work now because I've done 40 years in the country. I'm going to have six months to a year's rest and after that I'm going to think what I will do.\" He will get a decent redundancy payoff, although he doesn't know what it works out at. He says he has never been much bothered about money. How much does he earn a year? \"To be honest, I don't know.\" He gets the giggles. \"Like I say, it's OK if my hours are all right.\" </p> <p>Tony is a Methodist and has done a diploma in religion, and now he may use his time to do a degree. Could he become a minister? \"I don't think I will become a minister, but I'll always get to help people.\" In a way, I say, conducting is a form of ministering. \"Yes, I think so,\" he says. \"Everybody needs help at some time.\" He tells me of the policeman who got on his bus one Christmas somewhat the worse for wear. \"He was drunk, drunk, drunk, and he said, 'Look after me, I'm drunk,' and I said, 'That's good, man,' because it was Christmas and he was happy. And I looked after him not because he's a policeman but because he's a human being. He got off at Catford.\" </p> <p>Transport for London and the 10 private companies that run London's buses say there is no longer any need for conductors - buses will be run by the driver, and customers will buy tickets from the machine at the bus stop before boarding. Tony disagrees. \"What happens with vulnerable people now? On the new bendy buses, the driver can't get up and help people in difficulty. I think it comes down to two things - politics and profit. After the bus company became privatised, those two things ruled, like in every industry.\" </p> <p>Before Tony goes off to work, he introduces me to Flo Twumasi, who is sitting in the canteen eating her lunch. He says she will be happy to talk to me. But she isn't. \"Why should I talk to you?\" she says. \"How will it help save my job?\" I say I have come to the garage to look for conductors to speak to because Transport for London said it was unable to help me - they had asked the companies who run the buses and they had replied that their employees were tired of talking to the press and wanted to get on with their work. She laughs when I tell her that, and says, \"What work?\" Now she seems happy to talk. </p> <p>Flo is 47, and came to Britain from Ghana in 1980 to join her husband who was working here. She has been a conductor for eight years: \"We have our good days and our bad days, but I'd say the majority are good.\" A good day, she says, is one without hassle, one in which she will see her regulars and they will talk. \"I love the sociable part, chatting to people. Most of my regulars are friends.\" Does she see them out of work? \" Nooooo. As soon as I come off the bus, that's it.\" </p> <p>What's the worst side of the job? \"Working late at night, and standing on the platform - that is scary. Very scary.\" Luckily, she says, she has never been mugged. When she gets home at night, she is exhausted, and her feet are sore. Does her husband massage her feet? \"Noooo,\" she giggles. \"Nooo. I just have a bath and wait for the next day to come round.\" Does she think that collecting money is the main bit of the job? \"Oh, you collect the money and check the passes, but then there's safety, keeping the gangway clear, and all the questions people ask ... Of course, I don't like the fact that conductors are going because I'll be out of a job, but what can I do? The thing is, who am I? My opinion does not count.\" </p> <p>Flo hasn't got a clue what she will be doing in a few weeks' time. Is she scared? Yes, she says, she has to support her son who is at university studying systems engineering, but hopefully he will be earning soon, and thankfully her husband is working, and she still holds out the tiniest hope that they will find another job for her on the buses. Doing what? \"I don't know. Nothing really. I just keep my hopes high,\" and she laughs, a little despairingly. </p> <p>On the next table in the canteen, Adjei Kwaku, also Ghanaian, asks if he can talk to me. He is 44, and came to Britain when he was 27. He has done a series of odd jobs, is married with four children, and has been a conductor for three years. He talks quietly, intensely.\"The conducting job is very stressful. Very stressful,\" he says. \"Passengers don't respect conductors or drivers. Most people think you don't need any qualifications to be a driver or conductor. Let's take you, for instance. If you are in an office and somebody comes into the office and spits at you, would you be happy? Because that's what happens on the buses, they spit on conductors and drivers. I was spat on just because I told a man the bus was full. I did not allow him to come on the bus and he spat on me. It's my job. And I was upset when I got back to the garage and didn't feel I could work, and I was told, 'If you don't finish the day's work, we'll only pay you for the work you've done.' I didn't finish the job, I was too upset.\" </p> <p>Isn't it amazing how London has changed, I say - how it has become a multiracial melting pot. He nods, and says yes, it is good, but there are still problems. \"One Jamaican lady told me I was a fucking African, and I said to her, 'Where do you come from?', and she said: 'Jamaica is not Africa.' Sometimes the passengers are very horrible - you have to control your temper. Having been a bus conductor I can do any kind of public work, because I've got the experience of how to deal with the public.\" </p> <p>Is there anything he likes about the job? \"Yes, I like it because I see a lot of people and some of them are very kind, they talk to you nicely. But sometimes we go to work with a miserable face and somebody will come on the bus and tell you to smile, you know what I mean. That person doesn't know what's going on in your life, though.\" </p> <p>When he and his colleagues were told about the redundancies, he says, Arriva told them they would train them for other jobs, such as revenue inspectors or drivers. But he doesn't know anyone who has a new job to go to. He has just been sent a form asking if he is looking for alternative employment, but he doesn't hold out much hope. What kind of payoff will he get? \"The package is not good. For the three years I have worked I will get \u00a33,000. I'm looking for other work, security, whatever. Actually, I have decided to join the community police.\" </p> <p>Adjei is glad that they are getting rid of the Routemasters. \"I think it is a good thing because people fall off the bus and they can die. Almost every month you hear of someone falling off the bus and and hurting themselves.\" But if there is no Routemaster, and no dangerous platform, and no passengers hopping on and off, and if machines are dispensing tickets, doesn't that mean the companies are right when they say conductors are outdated? \"Most of the ticket machines don't work. So if people come on the bus and the ticket machine is not working, the driver won't let them on. Three days ago I had a man on my bus and he wanted to buy a one-day pass and there were no machines working, so what does he do then?\" </p> <p>Back in Ghana, Adjei passed A levels in English, maths and science. Has he considered going back to college? \"I would like to go to college, but how can I at my age and with my children?\" </p> <p>Bob is sitting at the same table drinking tea with us. Bob isn't his real name, but he still works for the company as a driver and doesn't want us to use his real name in case he is victimised. He has worked as a driver of one-man buses, a driver of the 73 Routemaster and a conductor. \"Driving without a conductor is very difficult. When you're doing the one-man bus, you do so many jobs. When you are on the 73 you feel more relaxed, more concentrated on the driving. As a one-man bus, apart from the problems on the road, your controllers put so much pressure on you. Most of them don't even talk to you nicely. You are not supposed to run early, and then when you run late, they ask why you were late. Now when we get to a bus stop and someone delays you, you have to make time for the person, and it might take five minutes, and at the end of the day you will come in five minutes late and the controller will ask you where you lost your time.\" </p> <p>When a machine is out of order, he is expected to take the customers to the next stop, where they can get off the bus to buy a ticket and get back on again. He laughs at the thought of 20 customers in search of a working machine. </p> <p>He takes out a book of dockets he has been given. \"This is called the customer service card,\" he says. The customer service card is to be used when customers can't get a ticket at the next machine or because they don't have change. \"You fill it in and give it to the person. So if the fare due is \u00a31, you write down \u00a31 and tear it off and give it to the person to go and pay with.\" Where do they pay? He holds his hands out, and says he hasn't got a clue. The customer service card is transparently flawed. There is no space to write the customer's address, and even if there were, how would the driver have the time to wait? Without conductors, how will the bus companies keep a record of customers who owe money? \"We have no idea. I think they are going to give every person the benefit of the doubt.\" </p> <p>Bob talks about his trade union, the Transport and General, dismissively. \"We have to forget about the union because they are not helping us in any way. Drivers want conductors to stay. I think if Ken Livingstone or Transport for London [had] allowed conductors on bendy buses, it would have been brilliant. It would have made the job safer and more comfortable for the driver.\" </p> <p>Bob, also Ghanaian, says he enjoys working as a conductor, but prefers driving because the money is so much better. \"As a driver, the basic is about \u00a318k, and the conductor gets about \u00a312k basic.\" Today he is doing overtime from 12.30 to 3 in the afternoon, then his real shift starts at at 5pm. \"You have to kill yourself to earn the money,\" he says. </p> <p>I arrive at Archway bus garage, hoping to find conductors who work on the 390 Routemaster, which is also to be scrapped on September 3. Unfortunately, the conductors were moved to King's Cross a year ago, Eleni Da Silva tells me. Eleni is sitting with her feet up in the canteen waiting to go to her afternoon shift. She is Brazilian, a driver, and wearing big black leather fingerless gloves that she is very proud of. Nowadays she is a one-woman driver, and says it is so much harder to focus on the roads than in the old days. \"You keep having to check on the tickets, and often people come inside and you can't work out what type of tickets they have.\" Not only was it more fun having a conductor, she says, she also felt less exposed. \"If something happened to me, he could be my witness, I wouldn't need customers.\" </p> <p>Does she have a favourite bus? \"Yes, I liked the number 10 Routemaster more than any other route.\" Why? \"I like the bus. It was very nice to drive. I want to go on it again before it goes away, actually. It was just good to be there. Good experience. The Routemaster is more solid, heavy, everything about the bus really, everything about the journey I liked, too. You left Archway to go to Hammersmith and it was quite a long journey, yesssssss ,\" she says nostalgically. </p> <p>Eleni is posing on the bus for the photographer. \"You'll have to unbutton your shirt. I had to,\" conductor Jim Stokes says. </p> <p>\"Ooooh, yeah,\" Eleni says enthusiastically. </p> <p>\"And don't forget to flash a bit of leg, this is the Guardian.\" </p> <p>\"Yessssssss , why not?\" </p> <p>A Transport for London spokesman says that, frankly, he is tired of all the sentimental rubbish that has been talked about the scrapping of the Routemasters. \"We're being portrayed as if we've got some evil masterplan, but there are four good reasons why the Routemasters are going. First, age: the newest buses are 36 years old and they were designed for a 17-year working life. Second, they are 10 to 15% more expensive to run than new buses - it's true that they use less fuel, but they also carry fewer passengers. Third, people are twice as likely to be injured on Routemasters as on other buses. Fourth, accessibility: we have a commitment under the government's Disability Discrimination Act to a 100% accessible fleet and we reckon 10% of our customers have some kind of disability.\" He says it is important to remember that even now, Routemasters only account for 300 buses in a fleet of 7,500. </p> <p>As for conductors, he says, again, it's easy to be dewy-eyed, but the fact is that their main job of collecting fares had disappeared. And while many passengers think conductors provide security on the buses, he says the reality can be very different. \"When conductors get involved in people's arguments, they often get assaulted. Transport for London is actually boosting security by increasing both the number of CCTV cameras and the number of police officers on buses.\" </p> <p>Jim Stokes is 50, and a conductor on the 390. He has worked on the buses for 14 years. If he had managed one more year, he and his wife would have got a free pass for life. </p> <p>He says society has changed since he started, and it is reflected by what he sees on the buses. \"When we started on the 139s, they were a lovely bunch of people, commuters - they would park their cars out in West Hampstead because there were no parking restrictions. They were polite, they always had their fares ready and you could communicate with them. But unfortunately on the 390s, like the 10s which we also used to run, the attitudes have changed.\" How? \"They are more arrogant. We pass the King's Cross area where we get a lot of drug addicts, and they try to give us hell. We have to adapt to their attitudes, which is a change, because it makes us rude and voluble when we don't want to be. They're down-and-outs.\" Do you have to be tough to be a bus conductor? \"These days you do,\" he says. </p> <p>The trouble, he says, is that so many people don't want to talk. \"They just turn their heads, and, 'Oh, sorry, don't understand,' which is the common response these days.\" Why? \"It's mainly because they're foreign. They either don't speak the language properly or if you go up and talk to them because you fancy them or you just want to be sociable, they pretend ... they're just not interested.\" </p> <p>Is he chatty by nature? \"I can be, but at the moment I keep myself to myself; that way I don't get no complaints.\" Has he been getting complaints? \"Everybody gets complaints: that we're ringing the bell too early, or the driver's driving too erratically and they're throwing everybody over.\" </p> <p>Jim talks in a similar nasal tone to Ken Livingstone, and has a similar anorak quality about him. Like most conductors, he doesn't have much time for the mayor of London, who said that he was going to put a conductor on every London bus before deciding to scrap them wholesale. </p> <p>He accepts that there is a problem with the safety and accessibility of the Routemaster, but doesn't believe that is the real reason they are being decommissioned. \"Well, we've been told that no firm likes to pay two wages with the one bus - that, I think, is the moral of the story. But according to the EU, we're having far too many platform accidents.\" Jim has had three accidents on his bus - \"not fatal, but very serious. One was completely drunk, another girl fell off ... they get off in the wrong direction to which the bus is going and they hit the ground hard. It's OK if you get off in the same direction that the bus is travelling, and if you can run fast enough you can slow yourself down without any injury. But get off the wrong way and you go straight to the floor.\" The new buses do have undoubted advantages, he says. \"They can dip the fronts to make the platform lower for the old-age pensioners, and they can carry wheelchairs and pushchairs, which is good.\" </p> <p>So they will, in fact, be better than the old Routemasters? \"No, they'll never be better than Routemasters. Because the Routemaster's a narrow bus, so it can get through tighter traffic, it can load up twice as fast, it can travel a lot quicker because it doesn't take as much loading-up time, and it's good for public morale.\" What does he mean? \"They are a centrepiece for us and the community. The public love them, they are a tourist attraction for London: the big red bus and the black taxis.\" </p> <p>I ask him what he has liked most about his job. \"Every trip you go down the road is completely different. Even though it's the same road, it's different people, so you're getting a second chance, so to speak. Well, I believe so, anyway. And we carry some of the world's prettiest women, and that is one good plus on our job. We do, you know.\" </p> <p>Englishman Jim earns \u00a317,000 a year and says his wage has depreciated over his working life. \"When I started I was earning more money in real terms. It wasn't until Margaret Thatcher started playing around and then we lost Christmas bonuses, attendance bonuses, London weighting ...\" He says he will get a decent payoff, \u00a318,000 after 14 years. \"But when I've spent the cheque, it will be murder.\" Is there nothing on the horizon? \"Nothing at the moment. It's all low-paid, \u00a35-an-hour jobs - cleaning, security, shop work.\" </p> <p>As we talk, the bus starts to move out of the garage. \"Where are we going, Len?\" Jim says to his fellow conductor, Lennie Ishmael. </p> <p>\"He's just checking the steering, I think, Jim.\" </p> <p>Lennie is 56 years old, from Guyana, and is wearing more gold than P Diddy. He tells me he is a driver and conductor, but at the moment is restricted to conducting duties. \"Unfortunately I was held up for drink-driving in my car and I was suspended for five years, so at the moment I'm on suspension, but I'm still conducting.\" He is going to court to try to get his licence back before he is made redundant. \"If I get back my licence before the third I will get back my job, and if I get a licence afterwards, I will have to take the redundancy money. The minimum you can serve when you get suspended for drink-driving is two years, and in October it will be three years since I was suspended.\" (Lennie calls later to say that he didn't get his job back.) </p> <p>He agrees with Jim that people aren't as polite as they used to be. \"As time goes along, people maybe value money more and they don't want to pay, even if you ask them. They tell you point blank they don't have to and they're not paying. And they forget their pass at home, and things like that, and it's very hard to get them to pay. Now people won't pay even if you stand over them and demand that they do.\" </p> <p>After the bus arrives back at the garage, Jim leads me out and shows me how to get a bus to Aldwych and points to a Routemaster. \"See that bus?\" he says. \"ALD 971B. It's the fastest bus in London, there isn't one that could touch it. All the other buses are regulated to do 28-30 miles an hour, but that one isn't. We love it. You never finish late on that bus.\" </p> <p>Down at Aldwych, a row of number 9 Routemasters form a neat line. Luz Mery is sitting on her bus talking to somebody. Would I mind waiting while she finishes her chat, she asks. She is Colombian and has worked on the buses for three years. Yes, sure, she says, there are tricky customers (\"My God , I have difficult passengers!\"), but the good ones more than make up for it. \"I meet many people who speak Spanish, or sometimes people bring me things. One day a passenger gave me cake. She said, 'This is for you.' I said 'Why?' She said, 'No, this is for you.' I had never seen her before. It was so nice. See the lady I was talking to? This is my friend now. We meet here on this route, on the number 9, and now she's a good friend.\" </p> <p>What will she do when she is made redundant? \"I don't know. I have a problem now. I need to work and I need to move - so how can I look for work?\" </p> <p>One bus down the line is Englishman Mark Mundy, who is about to set off for Hammersmith. It has just started sheeting down with rain. \"I only took up conducting temporarily because I was out of a job, and I said I'd only do it for three months, but I've ended up doing it for four and a half years.\" Why does he think he is being made redundant? \"Well,\" he says, swinging off the metal pole at the platform, \"obviously, Livingstone had to go with the safety regulations or whatever. But obviously they're saying: why should they pay two lots of wages when they can get away with one lot? Just one of those things, innit?\" </p> <p>Yes, he says, he has enjoyed the jobs, but it's not all roses. \"We only get four weeks' holiday after two years. Then, obviously, you don't get full sick pay unless you do five years' work.\" He apologises, and says he hasn't really got time to talk, and moves down the bus to work. Within 20 seconds he has doled out a couple of tickets, given a young man directions, and helped an elderly lady with a steady hand.</p>",
  "<p>A wonder pill that that could help people lose weight, stop smoking and may even reduce the risk of heart disease could be available within two years, according to research unveiled yesterday. </p> <p>Results from the first 12 months of a two year trial into Rimonabant were issued at the European Society of Cardiology in Munich and show that 40% to 45% of overweight and obese people in the trial lost 10% of their weight. </p> <p>The drug also reduced the harmful blood fats and the metabolic syndrome which leads to diabetes. Being overweight, smoking and diabetes are all factors in heart disease. </p> <p>Rimonabant works on a newly-discovered system in the brain which is involved in motivation and control of appetite as well as the urge to smoke. The drug was derived, in part, from observing how cannabis smokers develop the \"munchies\" - an overwhelming urge to snack. </p> <p>Dr Nick Finer, consultant in obesity medicine at Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, who was involved in the study on diabetic patients, said the drug \"could be a major advance in the management, not just of obesity, but of the risk factors of obesity\". </p> <p>\"We are excited for several reasons. One is the trial has given superb results in terms of weight loss. </p> <p>\"Two, it actually incredibly closely mirrors the result of an earlier trial of people who had lipid disorders.\" [abnormal levels of cholesterol in the blood that put men and women at risk of heart disease.] </p> <p>\"Three, information about the effects of the drug performing independent of weight loss in improving HDL cholesterol by about 25% - that is a huge increase and that is something we don't have drugs for at the moment.\" </p> <p>Across the world 13,000 people are involved in seven Rimonabant trials which are looking at its effect on weight, smoking and diabetes. </p> <p>Dr Finer said the he thought the drug would be useful in the first instance for people who ran a high risk of heart disease of strokes and who had not succeeded in dieting. </p> <p>\"It is looking exciting, and I think not only will it be a very useful treatment for patients, but I think it has the potential for changing the focus away from obesity being lifestyle to place it where it should be: at the heart of metabolic and cardiovascular risk.\" </p> <p>He added: \"It is not true to say people who are obese have no will power. My patients have lost 10 times more weight than other people but they can not keep it off.\" </p> <p>Dr Finer said that reducing weight meant reducing heart disease and diabetes. \"I do not think this drug will be some sort of short-term fix. It is like cholesterol and blood pressure pills; it is the kind of drug people might be taking long term.\" </p> <p>The study was carried out with 1,507 overweight or obese men and women in 60 centres across Europe and the US. </p> <p>Patients in the study on Rimonabant lost an average of 3.5 inches around their waists over the year, with some 39% on the drug losing more than 10% of their initial body weight. Insulin response improved, and HDL cholesterol increased by 27% in those on the drug - more than those on the placebo \"implying a significant direct effect of the drug on lipid metabolism\", according to a University Hospital Antwerp spokeswoman.</p>",
  "<p>It may seem premature to be talking about the next summer Olympic games in Beijing when the Olympic flame has only just been extinguished in Athens, but the organisation for the 2008 event is moving at lightning speed. </p> <p>The Beijing Organising Committee (BOC) has spent the past few months securing major commercial and sponsorship agreements which are expected to make the 2008 games the most financially successful in Olympic history. </p> <p>It has been little reported but already Volkswagen, the biggest passenger car manufacturer in China, has beaten competition from rivals such as Daimler-Chrysler, Hyundai Motor and BMW to win exclusive rights as the official automobile partner of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, an agreement worth $100m to the BOC. The Chinese passenger car market is expected to grow to 4.6m sales a year by 2008, double the current sales figure. </p> <p>This is the type of economic growth, with marketing opportunities, that has the major companies fighting to become involved in the Beijing Olympics. Bank of China and China Mobile have also signed up as BOC partners, aiming to take advantage of the rapid expansion of the financial services and mobile communications markets in China. These agreements will also include a big tie-up with the Chinese athletes involved in the winter and summer games.</p> <p>Staging a summer Olympic Games is a very expensive business and organisers have to balance the demands and expectations of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) with the needs of their own city and the legacy which the Olympics will leave behind for future generations. </p> <p>What Beijing has done very well is to use its rights from a very early stage to raise significant funds at a local level. Olympic funding is underpinned by two big elements - television rights and sponsorship. In Athens, television broadcast rights fees contributed about half of the $3.5bn raised while income from sponsorship contributed another $1.1bn. </p> <p>It is this latter source of revenue which the BOC have identified as one which they can control and they have taken advantage of their economic muscle to secure some extremely lucrative sponsorship agreements which will operate alongside the IOC's own sponsors, which include Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Kodak, Visa, Samsung, Swatch and Panasonic. They all currently contribute in the region of US $50m to be one of the 11 major sponsors. Such is the appeal to these major sponsors of the huge and potentially lucrative Chinese market that at least eight of the 11 are already committed to the Beijing Games. The BOC are likely to gain about $1.5bn from sponsorship revenue alone - a 30% increase on the figure from Athens. </p> <p>The giant Chinese computer manufacturer Lenova Group recently became the first Chinese company to join the exclusive Olympic sponsorship programme and, in addition to the agreements with the Bank of China, Volkswagen and China Mobile, commercial partnerships have been agreed with Atos Origin (information technology), General Electric (technology/media), and Swatch (timing). More agreements will certainly follow in the coming months. </p> <p>The key sponsors, most of whom have been involved with the Olympics for many years, know the value the games can deliver for them at a global level. Although there is little sponsor branding at the venues or on the competitors' clothing, an involvement with the world's premier sporting event makes a big statement about a company or brand. </p> <p>Olympic sponsors are, or want to be, number one in their marketplace and the ability to use the Olympic rings on advertising and promotional material is perceived as a unique and vital asset, which delivers outstanding benefits. </p> <p>The Beijing factor has certainly \"raised the bar\" in terms of opportunities and expectations for commercial partners. China has the world's largest population at almost 1.3 billion people and it is a market that big global companies cannot afford to ignore. The many sponsors who are already signed up for the 2008 games have had to commit very significant levels of money but there is little doubt that they will be the winners by the time the Olympic flame goes out in Beijing.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Nigel Currie is director of sports and entertainment marketing agency, GEM Group</p>",
  "<p><strong> Newspapers: </strong> I have the Guardian delivered every day and I get the Observer on weekends. On the tube I'll pick up the Standard, the Times or the Independent to see how other papers are doing news stories. It makes me realise how much people's perception of the world depends on where they get their news from. I'm not sure whether that's good or bad. </p> <p> <strong> Magazines: </strong> Time Out every week because it's useful and interesting. Occasionally GQ or Arena. Sometimes Dazed and Confused or Wallpaper* because they're slightly out there. A friend publishes a trendy magazine called Marmalade, which I like. </p> <p> <strong> Books: </strong> I've just devoured four books on holiday. Small Island by Andrea Levy, which is about the experience of Jamaicans coming to England just after the war. I had no real understanding of what it must have been like. A mad, cyberpunk novel by Don DeLillo called Cosmopolis, which is like Bret Easton Ellis on acid. A very pleasant book, The Pleasure of My Company by Steve Martin, which is a sweet story about a guy who's got obsessive compulsive disorder. And a wonderful book of short stories called The Boy Who Taught the Beekeeper to Read by Susan Hill. </p> <p> <strong> TV: </strong> I love good drama. I watch the programmes I'm in because it's the only way I get to see the end result. I hate those property makeover shows. I know they're popular, but they're so predictable. My favourite show is Will &amp; Grace - it's fast, it's funny, it makes me laugh out loud. I'm addicted. </p> <p> <strong> Radio: </strong> I've switched from Radio 4 to Radio 5 Live because it's easier to have on in the background. Also, I'm an Arsenal supporter so I listen to away games on Radio 5 Live and leave it on. </p> <p> <strong> Ads: </strong> A lot of my friends work in the industry and I occasionally do voiceovers.

  "<p>Not many newspaper proprietors have been arrested, although in some cases this may be considered an oversight. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr is one of a rare breed who not only has had his collar felt, and more than once at that, but can talk freely about the circumstances.</p> <p>His two arrests were a long time ago, and came about because of his involvement in protests against the Vietnam war. But as he is now chairman and publisher of the New York Times, his militant past appears in no way to have impeded his career. </p> <p>Indeed, this fourth generation scion of the Ochs-Sulzbergers, and the fifth consecutive family member to rule an almost regally dynastic news organisation, insists that his youthful liberalism has in no way disappeared. </p> <p>\"It was a highly-politicised time and, yeah, I liked being part of it,\" he recalls. \"I miss those days and maybe I'm getting back to those days. If I am not mistaken, when our founders Henry Raymond and George Jones ran that first edition of the New York Times in September 1851, they had a statement of purpose noting that they intended the paper to be radical in all those things in which change was necessary, and conservative in all those things where change was not. I like to think we are still clinging to that line.\" </p> <p>But in the quiet of his Manhattan home, or scrambling towards the peaks when indulging in his hobby of rock-climbing, Sulzberger may occasionally reflect on the irony of the anti-war stance that almost resulted in a fist fight with his father and predecessor, former Marine Corps officer Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Sr. </p> <p>Liberalism or no liberalism, Arthur Jr and the Times have been under fire from without and within for more than a year; not quite at war, perhaps, but metaphorically much blood has been spilled. </p> <p>Sulzberger's parents divorced when he was four years old, and until he was in his mid-teens he lived with his mother and stepfather, largely separated from Arthur \"Punch\" Sulzberger's upward path through the company, bought in 1896 by Punch's grandfather, Adolph Ochs. </p> <p>Ochs's son-in-law and Punch's father, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, had succeeded to the throne, to be followed by Orville Dreyfoos, who inherited the keys of the kingdom after marrying a Sulzberger. Arthur Jr's dad took over upon Dreyfoos's premature death in 1963 and is still very much involved with the Times and the other communication arms of the business. \"He has an office on the eleventh floor and comes in every morning until around lunchtime,\" says his son. \"When we have big issues, like Jayson Blair,\" he volunteers, \"he's always a good source of experience and intellect.\" </p> <p>With a constantly expanding dynastic line, Sulzberger was not a shoo-in for the top job. But in 1992, he was appointed publisher and five years later succeeded his father as chairman of the board. Only four members of the family serve on the 15-seat board at any one time, one of whom at present is Arthur's cousin, Michael Golden, the publisher of the International Herald Tribune, now wholly owned by the Times. Some of the flak attracted pre-Jayson Blair by Sulzberger consisted of accusations of over-aggressive business behaviour when negotiating the end of the partnership, with the Washington Post, which previously controlled the Herald Tribune. Sulzberger bridles slightly when I mention this. \"That [the accusation] was inaccurate. It was a difficult conversation, obviously, but there were options and I am not going to get into it except to say it [sole ownership by the Times] was the option they preferred.\" </p> <p>The Herald Tribune, it should be said, has flourished, as has the Times under Sulzberger's stewardship. The company profile is almost overwhelming: last year, its revenues totalled $3.2bn, and for the fourth consecutive year it was ranked top of Fortune magazine's list of America's most admired publishing companies. In addition to the Times and the Tribune, the group owns the Boston Globe, 16 other newspapers, eight network-affiliated television stations, two New York City radio stations and more than 40 websites. </p> <p>Following his brief denial of strong-arming the Washington Post, the only other time during our conversation when the publisher's bonhomie slips is when I ask about the conflicting versions of executive editor Howell Raines's departure after the Blair affair. In a memo to the Times staff in March of this year, Sulzberger stated that he accepted Raines's resignation \"with great sadness\". But in the May issue of the Atlantic Monthly, Raines wrote that he was dismissed - \"a casualty of the turmoil that followed the forced resignation of a young reporter\". Sulzberger's reply is curt: \"I don't want to get into that.\" </p> <p>He is, however, perfectly willing to discuss the Blair episode and beyond. When it was discovered that the reporter, previously favoured and protected by the paper's editors, had blatantly been faking stories, it was, says Sulzberger, \"a huge black eye. I can't speak for anybody else, but there were shock waves ... It was a bolt out of the blue. And it wasn't just Jayson Blair. </p> <p>\"To be fair, the events that transpired here had deeper roots than that. It was a wake-up call for us, it was a wake-up call for the industry. It forced us to confront in a very positive way the systems we had in place in our newsroom. And I think we are ... no, I know we are a better paper for having gone through that.\" </p> <p>The paper's public response to the scandal, a four-page mea culpa verging on self-flagellation, was criticised by former Times managing editor Arthur Gelb as \"a vast over-reaction\". Sulzberger doesn't think so. \"No, actually I'm proud of that [apology] - we owned up and put our finest people on the story. </p> <p>\"Maybe we should have cut it back to two pages, but it was important that we didn't try to hide it. We tried to be straight with our readers, and straight with ourselves. That's our responsibility. Not, not to make mistakes. We're human and are always going to make mistakes - but to own up to them. This is the only profession protected by the constitution of the United States, and that rightly places a burden upon us - to take seriously the role the founding fathers saw for the press, to keep democracy alive. It was a painful period, but we are through it. A new editor is in place [Bill Keller became executive editor; Jill Abramson the paper's first female managing editor], new stories are on the horizon, our new procedures are working.\" </p> <p>With the departure of Raines and his managing editor, Gerald Boyd, a public editor, or ombudsman, Daniel Okrent, was appointed and a regular corrections column and \"editor's notes\" - more detailed explanations - introduced. But the tumult within the Times has not subsided, and the \"new procedures\" seem to have ensured only that each new hiccup receives maximum publicity. </p> <p>A further public display of penitence, when a 1,200-word article signed by \"the editors\" avowed the paper had not been \"as rigorous as it should have been\" in asking questions during the run-up to the Iraq war, was followed by Okrent writing in the Times that it had been duped by \"the cunning campaign\" of those determined the world should accept that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This led to the Times being ridiculed by those who thought the paper was demeaning itself, and to Raines, who was in charge when the Iraq conflict began, leaping back into the spotlight to dispute much of the Times' self-criticism. </p> <p>The furore was still raging when it emerged that in his first seven months in the job, Okrent had sent 4,600 queries to members of staff, a statistic that no doubt fuelled newsroom outrage at his acceptance of what some considered an inappropriate outside board appointment. Sulzberger might have been forgiven for departing to find a rock to climb at this point, but he quickly responded when subsequently I suggested to him that the Iraq war repentance (in which he was not personally involved) was unnecessarily voluminous. \"A quality journalistic organisation owes it to itself and its readers, or viewers, to acknowledge its own errors,\" he said. </p> <p>Following the Okrent incident, it emerged that when asked what was the ombudsman's main achievement to date, Sulzberger had replied: \"Surviving.\" But he explains: \"The relationship between Dan Okrent, Bill Keller and me is open, honest and filled with mutual respect.\" </p> <p>Considering the outstanding achievements of the company over the past decade, and Sulzberger's determination to keep it at the forefront of a rapidly changing and expanding news industry, the Times's sackcloth-and-ashes phase may eventually be relegated to no more than a blip in its history - especially as research has shown, the publisher claims, that the brand has suffered no lasting damage. </p> <p>During his tenure, Sulzberger has been responsible for the development of an eight-section colour Times, and its expansion with 18 new print sites, plus successful ventures into electronic media. Circulation has increased in 10 of the last 11 audited periods, and is healthy at a little over 1.1m on weekdays and 1.7m on Sundays. </p> <p>The print expansion of the paper also includes an international drive spearheaded by the inclusion of Times's weekly news supplements in a cluster of foreign newspapers, including the Daily Telegraph. But Sulzberger resists any sentimental attachment to newsprint, and is proud that the profit-making NYTimes.com is - mainly through substantial advertising - the world's leading newspaper-owned website. </p> <p>\"I'm a print man, and print is still the powerhouse, and I suspect it will be for a very long time,\" he says. \"But we can envisage it vanishing. It is not the paper of our newspaper that defines us - it's the word 'news' that defines us. That's what we sell. That we do it on paper is great as long as people care for it on paper. But the minute they don't, that's all right too.\" </p> <p>Another, momentous, sign of the changing Times is the construction of a $850m skyscraper, which is scheduled, early in 2007, to become the newspaper's third home in the Times Square area. </p> <p>Sulzberger's liberalism manifests itself in his determination to engage ethnic minorities in the business, and he was also among the first to offer domestic partner benefits to gay and lesbian employees. Also significant is the recent appointment of Janet Robinson as the first female chief executive in the company's history. \"In this city and this country, we are in the midst of a demographic shift unlike anything we've seen since the turn of the 20th century, in terms of the immigrant population, in terms of the number of languages spoken. We are not doing our job as journalists if we don't reflect that world.\" </p> <p>He is concerned, too, about the diminishing respect for journalists and their trade. In a speech he ironically celebrated that \"journalists and editors continue to be more trustworthy than fortune-tellers, insurance salesmen and garage mechanics\", and says now: \"I happen to believe as a whole we are trustworthy. We do an extraordinarily difficult task - I don't think there is a harder thing in the world to do than hold up a mirror to the people around us and say: 'Hey, look at this, look at what you have done.' And 90% of the time we get it right.\" </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7 </strong> A longer version of this article appears in the British Journalism Review, Volume 15 No 3, from SAGE Publications, 1 Oliver's Yard, 55 City Road, London EC1Y 1SP.
