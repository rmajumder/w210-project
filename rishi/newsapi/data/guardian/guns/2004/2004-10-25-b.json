  "<p>Cash is cash. Until yesterday, that was the reason why, despite effigies at the Stretford End and mixed signals from the Irish shareholders, Malcolm Glazer looked as if he would emerge eventually as the new owner of Manchester United. </p> <p>Glazer was willing to pay more than anybody else for the company's shares and, in JP Morgan, seemed to have had found a bank that would lend him the cash to do so. Of course, Glazer's mega-loan would have come at a price - such as using prime assets, maybe even Old Trafford itself, as security. But such leveraged deals happen in the City all the time. When Philip Green was trying to buy Marks &amp; Spencer, shareholders did not bleat about the morality of the use of heavy borrowings; they just wanted to know if Green and his bankers were good for the readies. </p> <p>Glazer was proceeding on the same principle. He might be borrowing up to his eyeballs but, he assumed, that would be his look-out. All the United shareholders had to worry about was whether they liked the look of 300p a share. </p> <p>But they do things differently at Manchester United. The board's advisers, the City law firm Freshfields, provided the legal support yesterday for the rejection of Glazer, pointing out that directors' direct responsibilities are actually to the company, not its shareholders (for the aficionados, Dawson International versus Coats Paton, 1989, is a precedent). So if Glazer and his debts are bad for United the company, there's no deal; the Buccaneer from Tampa can go away and think again. </p> <p>The bad news for United fans' groups is that he probably will. When Glazer was rebuffed by the Irish, he responded with an aggressive share-buying operation to take his stake to 28.1%. It was a loud and clear statement. </p> <p>From Glazer's point of view, the most damaging aspect of rejection by the board is the effect on his financing. It has been said in the past week that JP Morgan never backs a bid without board recommendation. But that is not quite true. What the bank never does is advance a \u00a3400m loan without a thorough look at the books of the target company - the process is known in the City as due diligence. </p> <p>So Glazer's strategy now will be to find a way of forcing the United's board to allow him to conduct due diligence. There is a mechanism: as a major shareholder with 28.1% of the shares, he can requisition a extraordinary general meeting and force the matter to a vote. He would win, of course, if the Irish shareholders, with their 28.9% stake, voted with him. </p> <p>And why would JP McManus and John Magnier do so? Well, it is possible that they disagree with the position the United board took yesterday. There was no clear view from Dublin yesterday, beyond a wry observation that we are now in \"uncharted waters\", but look at their way: their investment in United has just fallen in value. The Irish did not grab at Glazer's initial approaches, which came with lots of strings attached, but his revised offer might have been better. </p> <p>In other words, do not assume this saga is over. Glazer can make life very awkward for the United board. Cubic Expression, with its infamous 99 questions on corporate governance, demonstrated that it is very hard for the board of a public company to ignore the views of a shareholder controlling almost 30% of the stock. </p> <p>In some ways, yesterday's statement by the board did not alter the wider picture: everything changes if Glazer and the Irish ever reach a deal. For as long as the possibility is there, speculation about a bid for United will not go away. </p> <p>That is probably why their chief executive David Gill yesterday also made an appeal for a \"long-term solution\" to United's ownership structure. He was heroically short on actual ideas, but he is correct that the current position is absurd. No other public company has to endure such an atmosphere of constant siege. </p> <p>Yet is is hard to see how the situation can change without Glazer relinquishing his ambition to gain control. He has enough stock to block most proposals, and he gives the impression of being sufficiently bloody-minded to dig in for a long haul. It does not mean he will win, but we could still be talking about bids and Buccaneers this time next year.</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United's directors yesterday broke off takeover talks with Malcolm Glazer, saying they could not support a bid that involved using high levels of debt to buy the club. </p> <p>The decision delighted United supporter groups as it represented a serious blow to Glazer's ambitions. Support from the United board was thought to be a condition of his offer, and the American and his advisers, the investment bank JP Morgan, were clearly not expecting outright rejection. </p> <p>One Glazer adviser angrily accused United's chief executive David Gill and his fellow directors of failing in their obligation to maximise value for shareholders in the face of intimidation by fans. \"They have abdicated responsibility because they can't handle the heat,\" he said. \"This is about the directors being able to continue to eat and drink in the bars and clubs of Manchester.\" </p> <p>Gill said the directors had taken advice from the leading City law firm Freshfields that the position was legally sound. He argued that an \"overly leveraged\" bid would not be in the best interests of the club and that the board's responsibility extended beyond the duties to current shareholders. </p> <p>\"The board has to have a view as to what the shape of the company would be going forward,\" he said. \"We are not going to do anything that jeopardises the competitive position of a club that has been around for 126 years.\" </p> <p>The timing of the United board's decision could not have been more delicate given reports yesterday that the Glazer family and Cubic Expression, the investment vehicle of JP McManus and John Magnier that owns 28.9% of the stock, had reopened discussions. The takeover panel responded by removing United from a formal-offer period. </p> <p>Glazer, who has built a 28.1% stake, did not get as far as making a definitive proposal but his plans were thought to involve borrowing at least \u00a3400m to fund a takeover that would have valued United at close to \u00a3800m. The United board is thought to have had two major concerns. First, that too much of United's operating profit would have been diverted to servicing that debt. Second, that the plan to increase merchandising revenues was too optimistic. </p> <p>The board also made an appeal for all sides to hold talks \"in order to seek to develop a long-term solution that brings stability to the company's ownership structure\". Gill conceded that \"there is no easy fix\" and would not be drawn on whether this implied a plan to end United's status as a public company. </p> <p>Glazer's camp did not concede defeat. He is still free to make a hostile bid for United, but would need permission from JP Morgan, a main lender. The bank, however, is unlikely to sanction such a move without an examination of United's books under the City's \"due diligence\" procedures. </p>",
  "<p> Rotherham customarily run on to their pitch serenaded by a piece of pre-match music which sounds a bit like an air-raid siren. It is a thoroughly appropriate soundtrack to a depressing chapter in their history. This was Rotherham's 16th successive League game without victory and their fifth consecutive defeat. </p> <p>Bottom of the Championship, they kicked off as the only team in the Football League yet to win a game this season and a club very much in transition. Indeed Mike Worthington and Darren Millington, the prospective new owners, are due to move in on Monday and are strongly rumoured to have placed the removal of Ronnie Moore as manager and the installation of Bryan Robson and Paul Gascoigne - or should that be G8 - high on their agenda. </p> <p>Moore devoted last night's programme notes to an admission that he had expected last week's home defeat against Plymouth to be his final game in charge. As he rather archly reflected: \"It was obvious certain people were wanted here as coach and manager.\" </p> <p>Yet, despite their woeful form, Rotherham supporters still adore Moore and cannot forget his wild over-achievement in recent seasons. They have made such feelings fully clear in weekend fans' polls and Worthington and Millington may have to rethink. </p> <p>Not that there were too many first-half indications of an imminent renaissance, the best two chances - both shots repelled by Rotherham's excellent Mike Pollitt - falling to Marcus Stewart and Julio Arca. Arca's nifty dispossession of Chris Sedgwick highlighted why several Premiership clubs are interested in the Argentinian, who is stalling on signing an extension to his contract which expires next summer. </p> <p>If Arca was the most accomplished individual on view, Gary Breen's central defensive solidity and Carl Robinson's central midfield efficiency succeeded in persistently siphoning a determined Rotherham into attacking cul-de-sacs in the first half. Moreover Mick McCarthy's side were endeavouring to play a pleasing passing game, the only trouble being that too many final deliveries went askew. </p> <p>The new period began with Arca's pass finding Darren Carter in an inviting position but not for the first time Pollitt spread himself well and restricted Carter's shooting options. The keeper then dashed off his line to block the on-rushing Stephen Elliott. </p> <p>But he was finally beaten by Dean Whitehead just after the hour, the goal registered in controversial circumstances as there was a strong suggestion of offside when Elliott clipped the ball through. With Rotherham's defence clearly expecting a flag, Whitehead elevated Sunderland to sixth spot in the table by stabbing his shot beyond the advancing Pollitt. </p> <p>\"Our keeper kept us in the game and we gave the ball away too often. But our energy, effort and commitment could not be faulted,\" said Moore. \"The goal was definitely offside but, when you're down, things don't happen for you.\" </p> <p> <strong> Rotherham United</strong> (4-4-2): Pollitt; Stockdale, Swailes, McIntosh (Gilchrist, 73), Hurst; Sedgwick, S Barker (McLaren, 71), Mullin, Warne; Proctor (R Barker, 66), Junior. <strong> Subs not used:</strong> Montgomery, Scott. </p> <p><strong> Sunderland</strong> (4-4-2): Myhre; Wright, Breen, Caldwell, Arca; Whitehead, Robinson, Whitley, Carter (Collins, 79); Elliott, Stewart (Brown, 89). </p> <p><strong> Subs not used:</strong> Lynch, Alnwick, Bridges. </p> <p><strong> Booked:</strong> Wright. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> D Gallagher.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> With the Spectator doing so much to flatter its new proprietors of late, we are struck by its most notorious columnist's impudent refusal to rein himself in until the storm dies down. Taki, the smiling face of racism in the Barclay-brothers-owned publication, has penned a column for the periodical Right Now!, and it is to this cogent work we now turn. Though the Greek playboy stops shy of referring to Kofi Annan as \"Sambo\" - his traditional form of address for anyone black - there's much to enjoy, as he considers the UN secretary general's redeeming features in the course of accusing him of being a crook for his role in the oil-for-food programme. \"He may look dignified at cocktail parties,\" writes Taki, before explaining that \"he has not been seen drunk and pawing at women like so many of his African brother diplomats ...\" Lovely. The secretary general is aware of the piece, says his spokesman Fred Eckhard, but on consideration deems it \"not worthy of comment\". Still, it's another blow for the Barclays, with the implication of tacit support for such views only crystallising the longer their stable continues to pay the old goat. <p><b>\u00b7</b> Surveillance (1): prime ministerial sister-in-law Lauren Booth, on Sky News at 8.50am yesterday morning, reviewing the day's newspapers. \"I can't help thinking,\" she mused of the upcoming US elections, \"that events in one part of the globe influence what happens in another.\" It's an extraordinarily astute thesis, even from a sibling whose contributions to political discourse always threaten to make Terry Major-Ball look like Bobby Kennedy, and we look forward to one of Lauren's excellent columns on the matter as soon as possible. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In Florida, George Bush demonstrates his usual willingness to represent fairly John Kerry's position on any subject before demolishing it. \"I've got news,\" yelped the president at a rally on Friday. \"Anyone who thinks we're fighting a metaphor does not understand the enemy we face, and has no idea how to win the war and keep America secure.\" This is so revealing. You see, for a moment we thought the circling wolves in the latest Bush campaign ad (viewable at <a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com\">georgewbush.com</a>) were some kind of lame metaphor for terrorists. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Such an informatively scary ad, we tell Dannielle Yaggi in the campaign press office - we've immediately ordered a hunting rifle over the internet. But we must know: how are we doing in the War on Wolves? \"Uh ... I'll have to get back to you,\" she giggles, but confusingly, this appears to be a metaphorical promise in itself. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The vice-president, meanwhile, materialises in a puff of smoke on various talkshows, with yesterday's appearance on NBC a particular triumph. Asked whether he wanted to reconsider his eve-of-invasion comment that coalition forces would be \"greeted as liberators\", Dick was baffled. \"The Iraqis I've talked to,\" he revealed, \"virtually to a man, all reiterate that gratitude they feel to the US for what we did.\" And that's just the Iraqis Dick has talked to - imagine the mandate if he'd been able to canvass opinions from all the dead ones, or those still firing their guns in a frenzied salute. Cheney 08 gathers pace. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Surveillance (2): Tony Banks, on Radio 4's The Week in Westminster last Saturday morning, being wheeled out to defend the government's repulsive gambling bill. His inherent contempt for the disadvantaged people it will exploit is hardly surprising - only in May, Tony tabled an EDM (cost to the taxpayer: \u00a31,014) which looked forward to the destruction of all humanity by \"the inevitable asteroid ... giving nature the opportunity to start again\" - but the use of language was more puzzling. To describe people as \"febrile-minded\" when you mean feeble-minded is unfortunate once, Tony - to do it three times in the space of a brief interview invites the dunce's hat.</p>",
  "Back in February, the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, did one of those things that help to mark him as one of the most interesting politicians of our age and continent. En route from Berlin for talks in Moscow with Vladimir Putin, Fischer stopped off for the first time in his life in the Baltic city that was once K\u00f6nigsberg and is for now Kaliningrad. He did so to mark the 200th anniversary of the death of the city's most famous son, laying a wreath and delivering an oration at the grave of Immanuel Kant. <p>Clutching his dog-eared copy of The Critique of Pure Reason, Fischer told his audience of diplomats and philosophers how Kant, along with Hegel and Marx, remained one of his own greatest influences. An understanding of law and morality as the basis of the rational world was Kant's continuing legacy to the present, he argued. Kant's 1795 essay Perpetual Peace, which envisages a global association of republics, could even be seen as a pointer towards the creation of the UN, Fischer suggested. </p> <p>It is impossible to imagine many circumstances in which one of Britain's past or current ministers would reflect on the continuing influence and relevance of one our own great philosophers. Jack Straw, Fischer's opposite number, is a serious thinker, but he will not be taking a leaf out of the German foreign minister's book on Thursday to deliver a graveside tribute on the 300th anniversary of the death of John Locke. </p> <p>Very few people appear to make the pilgrimage to Locke's last resting place in a tomb against the church wall at High Laver in west Essex. When I went to pay my respects there last weekend, I had the church and his memorial to myself. No one had signed the visitors' book for nearly two weeks. Locke's significance as a guiding spirit of the US constitution is duly marked by a church plaque erected by American admirers in 1957. But his importance in his own country is not acknowledged in any way. This neglect seems somehow bleakly appropriate of our current uncertainties. </p> <p>Locke certainly has his faults, and his critics, and it is important not to romanticise him. There is confusion, self-contradiction and much that is unresolved in his thinking. He was a man of the 17th century, and his advocacy of tolerance did not extend to Catholics or to atheists. His civil society of free, equal and rational men essentially excluded women and the labouring poor. Yet you do not have to be an enthusiast for Locke to recognise the sheer scale of his contribution to British life or his central position at the fountainhead of so much that came later. </p> <p>Indeed, it is hard to think of anything important about societies in general, and our own in particular, on which Locke did not have something pertinent and lasting to say. He is the essential philosopher of consensual constitutional government, the key expounder of the notions of the social contract, the sovereignty of the people, majority rule, minority rights and the separation of powers. He is our leading defender of individual civil liberty, the greatest advocate in our history of religious and civic tolerance, and the first proponent of progressive educational methods, as well as the principal godfather of all those attitudes of common sense, reasonableness, kindness and politeness that later eras have so often thought of as essentially British. </p> <p>So if anyone deserves to be the object of serious civic commemoration or reflection in Britain, then Locke surely qualifies. Yet this week's notable anniversary will pass here almost without notice. Elsewhere the interest is somewhat greater. Locke is generally taken more seriously in America, where a crude Lockean view of the contract between the individual (sovereign) and government (limited) remains widely held. Yet he has become a prophet without much honour in his homeland, even though he is the principal intellectual begetter of the 1688 constitutional settlement, which he did so much to legitimate and which has lasted from his day to ours. </p> <p>I am not arguing for large-scale celebrations, renaming of streets, a special issue of postage stamps or even an anniversary lecture by Simon Schama on the BBC, although none of these would be unwelcome. But it seems more than a mere oversight that we do not even consider doing any of these things. There are, of course, special reasons why Germans should wish to recall and connect with Kant. But other European countries also have explicit places and rituals of honour for their own great thinkers and writers. Britain is unusually negligent in this respect, especially considering our riches and our strong, if conflicted, sense of national identity. So one has to wonder: why? </p> <p>The big answer is surely that we gradually lost sight of the liberalism of which Locke has such a large claim to be the source. And lost confidence in it too. A hundred years ago, Locke's position at the head of a still vibrant British liberal tradition seemed utterly secure. Since then, the liberal tradition has declined, faltered, and has even seemed to have spent itself. For much of the 20th century, socialism appeared to be the philosophy and programme of the future, a stronger weapon to achieve wider social justice. In those circumstances, Locke inevitably appeared a more distant and less relevant figure. More radical and obscure 17th-century icons, like the Digger Gerrard Winstanley and the Leveller Thomas Rainborough, seemed to have more to say to our times. </p> <p>But socialism has failed. Even the era of the labour movement is passing inexorably away. We inhabit a world that has passed through the industrial socialist era and is emerging on the other side of it, dazed, disorientated and in search of new and more relevant signposts towards modern social justice and liberty. Capitalism has won the economic battle, albeit in a form that no 19th-century capitalist would easily recognise. Socialism has become a religion not a programme. And liberalism, which to socialists seemed for so long to be merely temporising and cowardly, has outlasted socialism. </p> <p>Which is why, in turn, it is time to return to Locke and the tradition at whose head he still stands. Liberalism without social justice is not a political programme in the democratic age. But nor, we should have learned from the 20th-century experience, is social justice without liberalism. The things that Locke thought were important - government by consent, the parliamentary system, civil liberty, freedom of thought and religion, the rights of minorities, an education that is more than functional, the rule of law - have never seemed more modern than they do today. Disregard for these principles has marked every instance of the failed socialist experiment. And it is also perhaps the most lasting - and least excusable - of all New Labour's failings too. To the politics of the future, as of so much else, Locke still holds the key. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.kettle@theguardian.com\">m.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "It is a serious matter to vote down the entire incoming European commission, but it also a serious mistake of the EU member states and of the president-designate, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, to propose Rocco Buttiglione as a candidate for one of the most important jobs: commissioner for justice and civil liberties (Report, October 22). He is entirely unfitted to that role. <p>If, as I hope, a majority of MEPs, who are directly elected, joins me in voting down the commission tomorrow, we shall be doing our job of holding the executive to account and helping remedy the EU's much-deplored \"democratic deficit\" two days before signature of the new constitution. </p> <p>It is not just that Buttiglione has prejudices against gay people and women. He has also proved himself, as a member of the Berlusconi government, complicit in widespread non-respect for the rule of law. On asylum, the Italian government is breaching the UN refugee convention by deporting migrants without determining whether they qualify as refugees. It held up agreement on the European arrest warrant, which cuts red tape in getting criminal and terrorist suspects before the courts, and Italy is the only country that has not implemented it. And it has passed laws to pervert the Italian justice system and give Berlusconi and others immunity from fraud and corruption charges. </p> <p>Barroso last week proposed a complicated arrangement whereby he and other commissioners would carry out the fundamental-rights part of Buttiglione's duties. But the portfolio is indivisible, especially as counter-terrorism measures threaten civil liberties.<br> <b>Sarah Ludford MEP</b><br>Lib Dem, European justice spokeswoman</p>",
  "<p>Birthday parties involving Wayne Rooney have a way of ending in a cloud of sulphur. A few months ago the police were called after fisticuffs broke out at the festivities when his girlfriend turned 18 and yesterday Rooney celebrated his own 19th birthday amid similar scenes of aggression and recrimination. But it was a day he will remember with a wicked pleasure for the rest of his life. </p> <p>Rooney may share with Diego Maradona a particular relish for goals that are stolen rather than scored. He certainly appeared to steal one after 72 minutes of yesterday's blood-curdling match, when he raced into the Arsenal penalty area and threw himself to the ground just as the desperate Sol Campbell was unwisely flicking out his foot in the direction of the Manchester United starlet's shins. </p> <p>Mike Riley pointed to the penalty spot and Arsenal protested en masse, a phenomenon that might once have led to a serious disruption of the fixture. In truth, however, Campbell had only himself to blame as he watched Ruud van Nistelrooy stroke the ball past Jens Lehmann. </p> <p>Rooney had set up the opportunity by picking up the ball and running from left to right across the face of the Arsenal area, dragging Campbell out wide with him. He played the ball out to Ryan Giggs on the right-hand touchline and accepted the instant return pass while turning back to face the goal. His acceleration and his close control were always going to engender panic in the nearest defender and Campbell, knowing he was losing contact, probably felt he had no option. </p> <p>For a teenager, Rooney has a chilling awareness of the tricks of the game to go with his awe-inspiring repertoire of skills. Two years ago, while still 16, he ended Arsenal's 30-game unbeaten run with a ferocious shot that made him look like a force of nature. Yesterday he ended the same club's hope of extending their latest streak to a half-century with a display that made it look as though he has absorbed every lesson in cunning that the game has to offer. </p> <p>Having given United the penalty with which they took the lead, Rooney finished off Arsenal two minutes into injury-time at the end of a move involving Ryan Giggs, Louis Saha and Alan Smith. The part played by Saha and Smith, two substitutes, must have helped put a smile on the face of Sir Alex Ferguson, who sent them on during the final minutes. </p> <p>From Ferguson's point of view, Rooney's double contribution must have represented a substantial repayment of his \u00a327m transfer fee. This was a match billed as the tipping point of United's season. Lose it and a 14-point gap to Arsenal would appear to eliminate them from the Premiership race. Win it and they would be back in the hunt. </p> <p>Inside and outside the ground the atmosphere left no one in any doubt of what was at stake, from several perspectives. Banners proclaiming a local distaste for Malcolm Glazer's attempted takeover were answered by taunts of \"U-S-A, U-S-A,\" from the Arsenal fans. As Peter Kenyon, the former Old Trafford chief executive, took his seat, he was roundly booed by the fans who once cheered him to the heavens. </p> <p>As the teams took the pitch the noise was loud enough to bring the stadium down. Arsenal's players went through an unfamiliar but clearly choreographed routine of hugging and high-fiving each other, a clue to the occasion's special significance. Within seconds of the start Ashley Cole flew into Cristiano Ronaldo, becoming the first to benefit from Mr Riley's lenient approach to a highly charged fixture. </p> <p>Five minutes later Rooney was next to escape punishment after going over the top on Cole in what may have been a belated piece of retribution for the assault on his team-mate. On the half-hour he caught Patrick Vieira after the ball had gone but received no more than a quiet word from the referee as play resumed. </p> <p>Rooney was the innocent victim a couple of minutes later when Cole - steaming with rage after feeling the bite of Van Nistelrooy's studs - chased him, bundled him over and walked away as the yellow card came out. Then Rooney played his part as United players took it in turns to foul Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, a menace on the left wing throughout the first period. In between bookings for the Neville brothers Rooney merely received another telling-off for barging the Spaniard into touch. </p> <p>A first half full of fire and brimstone had been shaded by Arsenal, who were unlucky not to be facing 10 opponents after Mr Riley refused to take action when Rio Ferdinand, the last defender, charged into Freddie Ljungberg as the Swede bore down on goal. But with snarls and scoldings as well as suave touches, Rooney had played as great a part as any United man in the raw-boned resistance that kept the scoreline blank and gave the home team more than a glimmer of hope. </p> <p>His, too, was the first significant initiative of the second half, when he won a corner and took it with a kick from which Paul Scholes volleyed wide from 25 yards. Then, as Arsenal mounted a series of threatening attacks, it was back to the work of attrition and construction, of breaking up the champions' pretty patterns and of cajoling some sort of coherence from a team which, at St Andrews last weekend and in Prague on Tuesday, looked as if it could not buy a goal. </p> <p>Thanks to him, they made the breach that ended the myth of Arsenal's invulnerability. No one could deny that Ferdinand, who repelled wave after wave of increasingly frantic attacks, deserved the man-of- the-match award. But it was Rooney who did the damage, who created the victory, who used the platform to provide further compelling evidence that, only five matches into his Manchester United career, he is destined to join the ranks of Old Trafford's greatest performers.</p>",

  "There can be few jobs in the United States Secret Service as cushy as being one of Jimmy Carter's bodyguards. You get to wear the cool earpiece, and ride in the blacked-out SUV, but, seriously, who's going to want to attack the most decent man to have occupied the White House in living memory? Wherever they go, George Bush, John Kerry and Bill Clinton are surrounded by burly, paranoid-looking men, ready to wrestle you to the ground if you breathe at them wrongly. But on a crisp autumn day at the Carter Centre, a human-rights institute sprawled over 35 leafy acres in Atlanta, Carter's security detail are relaxing near one of the entrances, trading jokes, while their 80-year-old charge works unmonitored within. Nearby, the young researchers showing up for work in jeans exude the happy calm of people whose jobs mesh well with their consciences. As they pass in the pink-walled lobby, they pause, make eye contact, and wish you good morning like they really mean it. All of which makes the question of how to address Carter slightly fraught. The standard practice (though not, I later learn, the official etiquette) is to call all former presidents \"Mr President\". But somewhere this informal, can that really be appropriate? <p>Actually, yes. The 39th president of the United States, in shirtsleeves and loafers today, is a man forever caught between niceness and grandeur. One of the two condescending cliches about him is that he was too nice for the White House, and perhaps in defiance, his manner remains somewhat imperious. With its gold-fringed American flag and massive, intricately carved desk, his private workplace seems like a replica Oval Office; the rumour used to be that his laptop still played Hail To The Chief when it was booted up. His use of the first-person plural, meanwhile, can sound decidedly royal. \"What we did, in our time, was to keep the country at peace,\" he will say later, in honeyed vowels that combine a lifetime in the political aristocracy with his origins as a Georgia peanut farmer. \"We had a very good actual record.\" </p> <p>But the grandeur vanishes, replaced by beaming smiles, whenever he talks about The Hornet's Nest, the book that recently made him the first former president to publish a novel. \"Are you familiar with Patrick O'Brian?\" he asks with excitement, explaining part of the inspiration for his densely researched tale of the American war of independence. I confess that I haven't read my way through O'Brian's long list of cult seafaring tales. \"I have,\" he responds. \"I've read all the way through them, and I'm reading them for a second time now.\" </p> <p>The other Carter cliche is that he is the best former president America has ever had. The fading popular memory of his administration is still dominated by the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran, in which 66 Americans were kidnapped, 52 of them held for months, and eight US servicemen were killed in a botched rescue mission. The Carter \"post-presidency\", by contrast, has been a marathon of valuable diplomacy in North Korea, the Middle East, Haiti and Cuba, of election-monitoring and Nobel Peace prize-winning. The Carter Centre, besides its conflict resolution work, has helped nearly eliminate several major world diseases. More recently, Carter has broken with ex-presidential etiquette by attacking Bush and Tony Blair for invading Iraq on the basis of \"lies or misinterpretations\", and savaged Jeb Bush over the potential for a new election fiasco in Florida. In his spare time, he paints. He makes furniture in his workshop in Plains, the Georgia village where he was born in the era of segregation. He studies Native American history. He writes poems. He is, depending on whom you believe, either an exuberant polymath, or a man still flailing to find a secure historical legacy. </p> <p>If it's the latter, I'm not sure The Hornet's Nest is going to help much. At 465 pages, the detail-laden story of Pratt, a Philadelphian lured to the South to fight for the American cause, is something of a slog, leavened mainly by its unintentionally funny sex scenes. (\"He was overwhelmed with a feeling of tenderness,\" one already much-mocked passage runs, \"and was also aroused sexually, which his tight trousers made obvious to both of them.\") </p> <p>Still, one neglected truth about the revolutionary war, deeply ironic today, jumps out from the novel: America owes its independence to the French. \"I never dreamed that by the time the book went into print, America would be refusing to eat so-called french fries, and things of that category,\" Carter says. \"Quite a ridiculous development. We could never have won the revolutionary war had it not been for the French.\" He smiles. \"Although the French didn't do it out of altruism, or love of America. They did it out of hatred for Great Britain.\" </p> <p>The more Carter talks, the more he gently lectures on the lessons of history and the dangers of the present moment, the more difficult it becomes to accept the idea that he was too nice for the presidency. Now that we know what happens when macho posturing replaces niceness at the White House, Carter's decency - his quiet moralism, his intense but low-key religiosity, his rock-solid marriage to his wife Rosalynn - all come to seem less like unaffordable indulgences and more like urgent necessities. (When it comes to toughness, in any case, there is style and there is substance: Carter, on taking office, had spent more years in the military than any 20th-century president except Eisenhower.) </p> <p>So why does he think the US electorate punished him so badly over Iran - a crisis that wasn't his choice, and in which relatively few Americans died - while the polls are so split about Bush's arguably far worse, and certainly more deadly, adventure in Iraq? </p> <p>\"I think the basic reason is that our country suffered, in 9/11, a terrible and shocking attack ... and George Bush has been adroit at exploiting that attack, and he has elevated himself, in the consciousness of many Americans, to a heroic commander-in-chief, fighting a global threat against America,\" Carter says. \"He's repeatedly played that card, and to some degree quite successfully. I think that success has dissipated. I don't know if it's dissipating fast enough to affect the election. We'll soon know.\" </p> <p>The bitter truth seems to be that the Iranian debacle was received so badly precisely because Carter had proven so successful, in other respects, at keeping the peace - whereas now, there's a war on. \"When your troops go to war, the prime minister or the president change overnight from an administrator, dealing with taxation and welfare and health and deteriorating roads, into the commander-in-chief,\" he says. \"And it's just become almost unpatriotic to describe Bush's fallacious and ill-advised and mistaken and sometimes misleading actions. The press have been cowed, because they didn't want to be unpatriotic. There has been a lack of inquisitive journalism. In fact, it's hard to think of a major medium in the United States that has been objective and fair and balanced, and critical when criticism was deserved.\" </p> <p>Another hazard of being a former president, it seems, is that you feel the force of your successors' policy reversals with all the acuteness of personal slights. \"All of those long, tedious negotiations that were done by Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Nixon and me and Reagan, to control the spread of nuclear weapons have been abandoned by Bush,\" he sighs. Carter praises Kerry for \"bringing out the fallacies of Bush's foreign policy\", but warns that he must \"show consistency in his positions, and that he's a strong leader. That's the only advice I'd give.\" </p> <p>Carter rejects the worst criticism that could be made of his administration: that his alleged softness in the face of Islamist terrorism helped nourish the threat that culminated in today's al-Qaida. \"I don't think that's an accurate assessment. \"The entire Islamic world condemned Iran. Nowadays, because of the unwarranted invasion of Iraq by Bush and Blair, which was a completely unjust adventure based on misleading statements, and the lack of any effort to resolve the Palestinian issue, [there is] massive Islamic condemnation of the United States.\" </p> <p> Still, it must be tough, having held the most powerful position in the world, to have so many people continue to believe that everything you've done since has been more impressive. Does the \"best former president\" line irritate him? \"Maybe it did at the beginning. But I don't have any doubt that my post-presidency has made some historians go back and look at the administration with a more benevolent and approving attitude. We promoted human rights, we promoted freedom, we promoted peace between others - peace between Israel and Egypt,\" in the Camp David accords. \"I feel quite at ease about the presidential record, and also the post-presidential. But I like to do different things. Last April, I began to paint...\" And he is smiling again, plunging back into the details of his richly varied life. </p> <p>Perhaps it is no wonder that Carter is still most aglow when he speaks of Plains, where he will sometimes rise at five, in the morning stillness, and write for five or six hours at a time. \"And then, when I'm tired of my computer screen, I usually go to my farmland to visit my crops, or to my woodlands, or I build another piece of furniture, or paint a picture. It's a very wonderful opportunity I have. Almost complete isolation.\" </p> <p>But he is a long way from retiring there permanently yet. \"I've got to go,\" he says suddenly. \"I have to go to Grenada.\" He jumps from his seat and vanishes to a private room behind his office. The interview is over and, as you leave, you find, to your surprise, that you've caught a bit of his glow - that you feel genuinely hopeful for hurricane-torn Grenada, and nostalgic for the days when the worst that could be said about a president's character was that he made himself look silly when he admitted to feeling lust in his heart for women who weren't his wife. </p> <p>Meanwhile, outside in the cool air, the happiest Secret Service operatives in all of America are bouncing on their feet to keep warm. Their conversation is beginning to drift towards wondering when Carter will be ready to be driven to the airport. But it would be wrong to suggest that they seem particularly worried about performing this crucial bit of bodyguarding. </p> <p>\"Shall we go find him?\" one of them asks. </p> <p>His colleague performs an exaggeratedly nonchalant shrug. \"He knows where the van is.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Hornet's Nest by Jimmy Carter is published by Simon &amp; Schushter at \u00a317.99.

  "<p>As the ball came down the two contenders were flat on their backs, thrashing about like seals. One got a flipper to it. This was flounders' day - and Fulham are floundering. </p> <p>There had been no foul. Phil Dowd's understanding refereeing kept the bookings to one. But a skidpan surface made a mess of best intentions, challenging foothold and mocking well-paid skills. Imagine Birmingham's celebrated symphony orchestra performing to a background of washing up and scaffolders. Beethoven might sound like Birtwistle. </p> <p>It was the same for both sides, neither brimming with confidence, but in the event Villa got their first win in six games and Fulham, in a still brief season, completed their second run of three defeats in a row. </p> <p>Villa will be fine, rising and falling between the lower limits of European contention and upper limits of relegation struggle. David O'Leary conceded that \"two individual efforts, all we managed, made the difference\". Chris Coleman recognised an ugly truth: \"All the signs are there for a relegation dogfight. We've got to fight like dogs and work like dogs,\" though both may soon be banned by the government. </p> <p>Fulham have lost belief as well as luck. There is only one \"f\" in confidence and Fulham cannot find it. The positive force that carried them, to their own engaging surprise, to ninth in May has been replaced by a negative one that seems to expect nothing but adversity and gets it. </p> <p>On Saturday Fulham soon lost Ian Pearce with a medial ligament injury, forcing Zesh Rehman into a league debut out of position and giving Fulham a double-z pairing of Zesh and Zat (Knight). Rehman did well enough but failed to cut out Lee Hendrie's sweetly curled goal, his third in four matches. </p> <p>Earlier Hendrie had stumbled on the ball, Bouba Diop ran into him and Nolberto Solano con verted a harsh free-kick. Tomasz Radzinski, due for second-half introduction, tweaked a hamstring at half-time. And, when Claus Jensen's free-kick hit the jumping Hendrie's upstretched arm at 0-1, the lack of a penalty hardly squared with one conceded by Moritz Volz less voluntarily against West Brom. When the gods are not with you they are against you but Fulham must not think like this. </p> <p>No doubt Birmingham will get one of Tony Blair's Las Vegas-style casinos and Premiership footballers, with more money than sense, will be likely patrons. But it cannot be more of a lottery than the rub of this glistening green. If Mohamed Al Fayed's affection for Fulham really is waning, this may be the time to sell to those Turkish casino owners. Let them have craps. Here, through no one's fault, it was rather the singular. </p> <p>\"The bottom line is that we're not good enough at present,\" said Coleman. \"We train like demons during the week but last season there was a grittiness to win tackles and refusal to be beaten. We need that will back and to take responsibility.\" </p> <p>The manager may dish out hand-mirrors today. He rightly said that, having conceded eight corners in the first 20 minutes, \"we got into good positions in the second half but didn't pull the trigger\". Four times Luis Boa Morte, not normally shy, was clear but delivered nothing. At least Tosh Chamberlain, of fond left-wing memory, shot himself in the foot. </p> <p>Fulham's squad is heavy with midfielders but that is no reason always to play five there. Andy Cole was never a spearhead but half a twin, a pointless flicker-on now in 4-5-1 who, if he gives and goes, goes too slowly. His return to Birmingham for a Carling Cup tie on Wednesday may remind him nostalgically of how it was with Dwight Yorke. Cole was captain on Saturday because, in the injured absence of Lee Clark and Sylvain Legwinski, \"he has a good voice\". Coleman should know about male voice choirs. Perhaps he should issue hymn sheets with those mirrors. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match:</strong> Phil Dowd (referee)</p>",
  "<p>Footballers tend to be creatures of habit but Stewart Downing's is one of the more useful. Middlesbrough's improvisational England Under-21 international left-winger has the coveted knack of salvaging seemingly lost causes by creating or scoring goals. </p> <p>With Steve McClaren's side trailing to pacy, cleverly configured guests yesterday Downing performed his latest Red Adair act, pouncing on a loose pass and scoring the goal that eased his manager's growing touchline discomfort. </p> <p>It was Downing's fourth of the season - not a bad tally for an orthodox winger who started the campaign in the reserves. But even so all the pre-match attention focused on a certain Dutchman. </p> <p>The Undertones may not have had Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in mind when they recorded Jimmy Jimmy but their hit has been adopted by Riverside regulars in homage to their leading scorer. </p> <p>But its final strains had barely faded from the Tannoy when Diomansy Kamara reminded everyone that Hasselbaink and Mark Viduka were not the only strikers on the pitch by shooting Portsmouth ahead, then promptly earning a yellow card for removing his shirt in celebration. </p> <p>Struck low and left-footed from 20 yards, after seizing possession from an adroitly dummied George Boateng, Kamara's goal emphasised why the Senegal international was signed from Modena. </p> <p>Nominally deployed as a deep-lying, left-sided midfielder in Harry Redknapp's flexible 4-5-1 formation, with freedom to break with alacrity when circumstances dictate, Kamara's rapid change of pace persisently destabilised Boro's back line. </p> <p>\"He's a special player,\" said Redknapp who appeared unsure as to whether the forward was on loan or had signed permanently. \"Kamara doesn't speak a word of English and can't understand the booking but he'll become one of the Premiership's top talents.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, across on Boro's left was another such talent, Downing offering Andy Griffin, Portsmouth's underrated but feisty right-back, a tough challenge. </p> <p>Apart from demonstrating the bravery to go outside Griffin - who, typically, gave as good as he got - Downing earned Boro a series of dead balls. Indeed his corner conjured their best chance of the first period, a header from Szilard Nemeth - on for the injured Gaizka Mendieta - which was cleared off the line by a back-pedalling Yakubu Aiyegbeni. </p> <p>Portsmouth arrived burdened by a dismal away record but the sheer pace of Yakubu, Lomana Lua Lua and Kamara - the latter two wide men sporadically joining Yakubu in an all-African attacking trinity - gave Boro an unnerving time. Moreover Ray Parlour and the strangely underperforming Boateng found themselves outnumbered in central midfield, a zone Patrick Berger used as the launchpad for menacing breaks from deep. </p> <p>Although Boro missed several decent openings, with Hasselbaink unusually profligate, Kamara spurned a highly inviting second-half invitation to double Portsmouth's lead following another Boateng error. </p> <p>Suitably spurred, Downing interpreted it as the cue to perform that now customary rescue mission. Intercepting Nigel Quashie's slapdash, tired pass, the winger - by now switched to the right - shimmied beyond two markers, cut inside and let fly, left-footed, from outside the area, his low shot flashing between Hislop's legs. </p> <p>McClaren is invariably, and deliberately, extremely downbeat about Downing and yesterday proved no different. \"I thought he was having a fairly quiet time on the left but moving him to the right brought him to life,\" he reflected before grudgingly conceding: \"Stewart's dangerous crosses and goals show that his game has an end product - and he is lethal from 18 yards.\" </p> <p><strong> Man of the match: </strong> Stewart Downing (Middlesbrough)</p>",
  "Israel has agreed to allow the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to leave his compound to receive medical treatment, Israeli media reported tonight. <p>The decision would permit Mr Arafat to leave his compound in Ramallah for the first time in two and a half years and receive attention at a nearby hospital in the city in the West Bank. </p> <p>There was some initial confusion about whether the Israelis would allow Mr Arafat to return to his compound, which has been heavily damaged by Israeli attacks over recent years. But the latest reports appeared to indicate that Israel would allow him to return as long as he stayed in the West Bank territory. </p> <p>There was no indication that Mr Arafat wanted to leave the West Bank city and Israel's move apparently followed a request by his aides for him to be treated locally. In the past, Israel has threatend not to allow him to return if he ever left the West Bank.</p> <p>Israel television reported that the defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, had given the permission for a hospital visit.</p> <p>Mr Arafat is recuperating from the flu. In recent days he had been seen by doctors from Egypt and Tunisia. He was seen in public yesterday and it was thought that Israeli officials may have been responding to a request from Mr Arafat's aides from several days ago when he was more ill. </p> <p>Earlier, the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, opened a controversial parliamentary debate on the withdrawal of Jewish settlers from the Gaza strip, hours after a major Israeli army raid on the Khan Younis refugee camp today left 14 Palestinians dead and 72 wounded.</p> <p>\"This is a fateful hour for Israel. We are facing an unprecedented decision,\" Mr Sharon told the Knesset, as lawmakers opposed to his plan heckled him. \"I call on the people of Israel to unite in this fateful moment, to allow us ... to erect a dam against the hatred among us.\"</p> <p>He told the parliament the plan would lead to greater peace and strengthen the country. \"I'm convinced this disengagement will strengthen Israel and its hold on the territory vital for our existence,\" he said in reference to the West Bank, home to larger Jewish settlements.</p> <p>Outside, thousands of police were deployed to protect the parliament, after receiving an anonymous threat to kill Mr Sharon and fears over mass rallies for and against the controversial bill.</p> <p>On Sunday, the Israeli cabinet voted 13-6 to approve Mr Sharon's plan, which provides for compensation for about 8,800 settlers who are to be uprooted, with payments of up to \u00a3278,000 for settlers who are forced from their homes and jail terms for those who resist.</p> <p>The parliamentary debate is expected to be bitter, with about 18 of the Likud party's 40 MPs saying they intend to vote against the legislation, making it increasingly difficult for Mr Sharon to govern. Mr Sharon will rely on the support of the opposition Labour Party, lead by Shimon Peres, who has described the vote as one of the \"strangest in history\".</p> <p>\"The main opposition party in its entirety will support the prime minister's policy whereas the prime minister's party will split in the vote and about half the members will vote against the prime minister,\" he said.</p> <p>Religious figures have also expressed their disquiet over the bill, with the spiritual leader of the religious Shas party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, ruling at the weekend that its MPs are obliged to vote against the plan.</p> <p>Violence has erupted in Gaza in the months since Mr Sharon announced his controversial withdrawal plan to start next year. </p> <p>In a major assault on the Khan Younis camp in southern Gaza, Israeli air strikes and tank fire killed 14 and wounded 72, according to doctors. Three members of the Palestinian security forces, a gunman and an 11-year-old schoolboy were among the dead.</p> <p>Two Israeli soldiers were injured when Palestinians fired an anti-tank missile.</p> <p>The army said the raid on the refugee camp was aimed at stopping militants from launching mortar attacks on nearby Israeli settlements. It also that it had demolished the home of a local Hamas leader who was responsible for the attacks that killed eight Israelis.</p> <p>The disengagement plan would mark the first time Israel pulled down Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza since capturing land in the 1967 war. </p>",
  "<p>Saul Dibb's debut feature is an intriguing mish-mash: part gangster film, part Loach-style social drama and part morality tale. Ricky (played with fatalistic charm by Ashley Waters, So Solid Crew's Asher D) is a black kid from Hackney, fresh out of prison and (fairly) determined to go straight. However he is quickly drawn into a feud with local hoodlums that begins inconsequentially but ends in a full-scale family tragedy involving Ricky's volatile best friend Wisdom (Leon Black), his long suffering mum (Claire Perkins), and his 12-year-old brother Curtis (Luke Fraser.)</p> <p>Dibb (best-known for his documentary with Jon Ronson, The Tottenham Ayatollah) doesn't entirely avoid gangster movie cliche, and certain lines of dialogue sound as if they've been borrowed wholesale from The Godfather. The symbolism is sometimes heavy-handed too. The gun, which Ricky hides in a sock in the bedroom he shares with his younger brother, is fetishised throughout and even treated in semi-biblical fashion as if it is the fruit of the forbiden tree. </p> <p>The film is shot in desaturated colours with plentiful handheld camera. Dibb uses his north London locations (Hackney's so-called \"murder mile\") in lithe, imaginative fashion, making the city seem eerie and oppressive. He also has an eye for incongruously comic or surreal images - Curtis and his friend throwing stones at the corpse of a bulldog in the canal, or running amok in a vast, empty park. He constantly cuts away to Curtis to give a child's eye view of the violence and score settling that surrounds Ricky. </p> <p>Ricky's London is racially divided. The only white characters he encounters are cops or probation officers or prison warders, but Dibb is making a thriller, not a polemical documentary. Though the film touches on topical issues (gun crime, unemployment, single parent families, police brutality), its primary focus is on character and narrative. The trajectory of Bullet Boy is familiar from countless other gangster pictures, but it's to Dibb's credit that the film seems so fresh and vivid despite its borrowings and its grim, all-too-predictable denouement.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> At Odeon West End on Monday at 9pm.</p>",
  "Juries are to be told about the previous convictions of all defendants under a government crackdown on repeat offending. <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, announced today that from December judges will be expected to reveal if a defendant has prior convictions for the same offence they are charged with. But for child sex offenders the new measures are more wide-ranging.</p> <p>Juries can be informed of any related past crime or conduct in the case of people charged with child sex abuse or theft. For example, someone facing charges of child rape could have previous convictions for downloading child pornography from the internet revealed to the jury.</p> <p>If this proves successful, these special measures will be extended to cover other types of offences, such as murder, said the spokeswoman.</p> <p>For other offences such as a man assaulting his wife then his previous convictions for domestic violence will be revealed to the jury, said a home office spokeswoman. But if he had previous convictions for another type of assault, such as grievous bodily harm, this would not necessarily be revealed.</p> <p>Other evidence of a defendant committing the same bad conduct in the past, such as social services reports, could also be considered in trials in England and Wales.</p> <p>The courts will have discretion on whether or not to allow previous convictions to be made known, but the onus will be on judges to make the details public.</p> <p>The controversial reform, which will apply in crown and magistrates' courts, reverses the current legal situation in which evidence about a defendant's past crimes is generally inadmissable in criminal proceedings. Disclosing such information to a jury would usually lead to the proceedings being stopped and a retrial ordered by the judge.</p> <p>David Walker, policy adviser for the crime reduction charity Nacro, warned: \"The law has always recognised that juries who are aware of previous convictions are more likely to convict. </p> <p>\"Unless these powers are very carefully applied, there is a real possibility of more miscarriages of justice. This includes the risk that ex-offenders could be prosecuted unfairly on the basis of their previous convictions and to the detriment of their rehabilitation.\"</p> <p>But Mr Blunkett said the reform, introduced in an order laid before parliament today, would allow juries to have greater access to information about previous convictions and other types of misconduct \"without unduly prejudicing the fairness of the trial\". He said: \"Trials should be a search for the truth and juries should be trusted with all the relevant evidence available to help them to reach proper and fair decisions. \"The law has recognised for over a century that evidence of a defendant's previous convictions and other misconduct may be admitted in some circumstances.</p> <p>\"But the current rules are confusing and difficult to apply, and can mean that evidence of previous misconduct that seems clearly relevant is still excluded from court.\" </p> <p>The measures, which follow reforms in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, will have to be debated by both houses of parliament. </p> <p>Related stories Home abusers 'likely to commit other crimes' Saturday March 20, 2004 Labour scrapes win on hospital and jury plans Friday November 21, 2003 (NHS Plan)</p> <p>Useful sites Home Office http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/ Criminal Justice Act 2003 http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/20030044.htm Nacro http</p>",

Grow up Arsene and get an education!\"</p> <p>Obviously a degree in Engineering, a Masters in Economics, a diploma in Soccer Coaching and Management, and the ability to speak five languages isn't quite what its cracked up to be nowadays.</p> <p>Gene Solorio is equally unimpressed at the behaviour of the Arsenal manager and his United counterpart. \"Reading Ferguson's and Wenger's comments, it almost makes Jose Mourinho look like a class act.\" Steady on Gene, steady.</p> <p>Barely able to hide his glee, Andrew Cooper takes time out from throwing darts at a photo of Wenger to write, \"Why can't Arsenal fans (and I include amongst them the writers on your Highbury fanzine, aka the Guardian football section) just accept that Arsenal cant beat Man Utd in important games? Yes, they can beat lesser opposition, yes they can win the Community Shield, but they cant get anywhere in Europe, and they cant beat United when it matters. End of story. Again.\" And breathe, Mr Cooper.</p> <p>In the face of a torrent of abuse for the champions, Ron Bone remains unmoved by the result, but unhappy with the tactics employed by United. </p> <p>\"Gary Neville's kicking was masterly - at Jose Reyes,\" he says. \"Van Nistelrooy should have been sent off for a deliberate injury-causing kick at Cole. Rooney must practice diving at his swimming pool every day, and Ferdinand should have been red carded. Enough said. Arsenal will go on playing the best football in the Premier League.\"</p> <p>But, among Arsenal fans, Mike Riley isn't spared. \"Is there any committee that reviews referees?\" fumes Jean Michel. \"If not why not?</p> <p>\"I can't even start to understand how any Arsenal player shook his hand. Riley do us a favor and stay at home, you are&#xa0;a total disgrace.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Chris H draws comparions with Riley's performance with pre-independence Zimbabwe.</p> <p>\"The match at Old Trafford reminded of a scene I once saw in the late 70s in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) at the Salisbury (now Harare)&#xa0; Agricultural Show,\" he says. \"A gang of about&#xa0;eight white boys were beating up two black teenagers - with the police looking on, unconcerned.&#xa0;As soon as the Black men began to hit back, the police&#xa0;sprung into action&#xa0; and arrested the black youths for public violence. The white boys were allowed to go scott free. </p> <p>\"That was the law in Rhodesia. It could neither be questioned nor challenged. Neither&#xa0;can Riley. In the world in which&#xa0;Black players&#xa0;have&#xa0;their existence, there is nothing so finely felt and so finely conceived as injustice.\"</p> <p>But the last word goes to Lee Hawkins, who asks \"Who threw the soup? Surely it was Heinze,\" he says. Or should that be Sol Campbell?</p>",
  "Anthony Hecht, one of the most accomplished American poets of his generation, has died at the age of 81. Hecht's work combined a passionate interest in form with an unflinching determination to confront the horrors of 20th-century history, in particular the second world war, in which he fought, and the Holocaust. <p>He was born in New York City to parents of German-Jewish ancestry. Hecht defined his family as \"upper-middle-class\", but his father's reckless business ventures and the 1929 crash made him feel the family was always poised to plunge down the financial and social scale. He was educated at schools in the city - at one point he was a classmate of Jack Kerouac - and then at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson. </p> <p>While studying English there he decided he wanted to become a poet, an ambition his parents tried to discourage: they delegated a family friend, Ted Geisel, better known by his pen name of Dr Seuss, to dissuade Hecht from pursuing this vocation, to no avail. </p> <p>After three years at Bard, Hecht was drafted into the 97th Infantry Division and dispatched to Europe. The horrific experiences of his war years permeate many of his most moving poems. His division helped liberate Flossenb\u00fcrg, a concentration camp near Buchenwald. Hecht was instructed to interview French prisoners in the hope of assembling evidence with which to try the camp's commanders. He later commented: \"The place, the suffering, the prisoners' accounts were beyond comprehension. For years after I would wake shrieking.\" </p> <p>On his return to America, Hecht took advantage of the GI bill to study with the poet-critic John Crowe Ransom at Kenyon College. He soon came to meet fellow poets such as Robert Lowell, Allen Tate, Randall Jarrell and Elizabeth Bishop. His first collection, A Summoning Of Stones (1954) revealed his mastery of a complex range of forms and an impassioned awareness of the forces of history. His poetry has often been compared with that of Auden, with whom he became friends during a stay in 1951 on Ischia, where Auden spent each summer. In 1993 he published The Hidden Law, a forceful critical reading of Auden's oeuvre. </p> <p>Hecht soon won many admirers, and prizes, including the Prix de Rome in 1951 and a Pulitzer in 1968 for The Hard Hours. It was in this volume that Hecht began to explore his memories of the war - memories so potent they had resulted in a nervous breakdown in 1959. Hecht spent three months in hospital, but unlike Sylvia Plath, whom he had met at Smith College, he was spared electric shock therapy. The long poem Rites and Ceremonies is Hecht's most disturbing response to the Holocaust: </p> <p>But in the camps, one can look through a huge square <br>Window, like an aquarium, upon a room <br>The size of my livingroom filled with human hair ... <br>Out of one trainload, about five hundred in all, <br>Twenty the next morning were hopelessly insane. <br>And some there be that have no memorial, <br>That are perished as though they had never been. <br>Made into soap. </p> <p>In comparison with his hero, Auden, Hecht wrote slowly and relatively little: in the course of a 60-year career, he published only seven collections of poetry, and his complete works would fill only 500 pages. However, nearly all of Hecht's poems, even his lighter verses, strike one as so carefully worked as to be unimprovable. </p> <p>His poetry also reflects his erudition. Hecht earned his living as a teacher of poetry, principally at the University of Rochester, where he was John H Deane professor of poetry and rhetoric, but his career also included stints at Smith, Bard, Harvard, Georgetown and Yale. His poetry shows itself aware of the traditions of European and American poetry, but also concerns itself with other art forms, in particular painting and architecture. </p> <p>The title poem of his 1979 volume, The Venetian Vespers, is a dramatic monologue spoken by a \"mentally unsound\" American who has settled in Venice in the hope of escaping his memories of the war. Hecht plays off his suffering and stoic resolve against the city's decay and dignity and beauty and history. </p> <p>Hecht's poetry will stand, along with that of James Merrill, Richard Wilbur, John Hollander and Richard Howard, as exemplifying the virtues of a commitment to the formal that produced some of the finest American poetry of the 20th century. His work has also been influential on the younger generation of formalists, poets such as Brad Leithauser, Mary Jo Salter and JD McClatchy. </p> <p>Over the last two decades he was the recipient of almost every honour in American poetry including the Bollingen Prize (1983), the Tanning Prize (1997), and the Poetry Society of America's Frost Medal (2000). </p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Helen, and their son, and two sons from his first marriage. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Anthony Evan Hecht, poet, born January 16 1923; died October 20 2004</p>",

  "A huge cache of 340 tonnes of conventional explosives has gone missing from a military facility that once played a key role in Saddam Hussein's efforts to build a nuclear bomb, the UN confirmed today. <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohamed ElBaradei, will report on the materials' disappearance to the UN Security Council later today.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/25/international/middleeast/25bomb.html?hp&amp;ex=1098763200&amp;en=fd35fdf4b6d46d61&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage\">report</a> in the New York Times, the IAEA had warned US officials to keep track of the cache, which had been monitored by UN weapons inspectors for many years. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Dr ElBaradei did not comment on any warnings the IAEA had given in the past but she said it had received a declaration from the Iraqi Ministry of Science and Technology on October 10 that explosive material had gone missing. \"The most immediate concern here is that these explosives could have fallen into the wrong hands,\" she said. </p> <p>The cache of explosives missing from the sprawling al-Qaqaa facility, which is around 30 miles south of Baghdad, is so big it would need a fleet of around 40 large trucks to be transported. </p> <p>It was placed under US military control but has repeatedly been looted and the New York Times said as recently as yesterday the area was a 'no man's land'.</p> <p>IAEA inspectors pulled out of Iraq just before the 2003 invasion and have not yet been able to return, despite Dr ElBaradei's repeated urging that the experts be allowed back into the country to finish their work. </p> <p>Saddam was known to have used the site to make conventional warheads, and IAEA inspectors dismantled parts of his nuclear programme there before the 1991 Gulf war. Dr ElBaradei told the Security Council before the war that Iraq's nuclear programme was in disarray and that there was no evidence to suggest the country had revived efforts to build atomic weaponry. </p> <p>The missing explosives could be used to detonate a nuclear device, although anyone wishing to do so would have great difficulty obtaining the required designs and nuclear fuel. </p> <p>There are fears that such a large amount of explosives could still cause great damage if used by insurgents who have attacked coalition and Iraqi forces. Just a small amount of the explosives, mainly HMX (which stands for high melting point explosive) and RDX (rapid detonation explosive), are capable of shattering aeroplanes and destroying buildings. Less than a pound of a similar kind of explosive brought down the Pan Am Flight over Lockerbie in 1988. </p> <p>The New York Times reports that Iraqi officials warned the US coalition provisional authority in May 2004 that the explosives had probably been looted. </p> <p>The US national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was informed about the missing explosives last month but it was unclear if the US president, George Bush, had been told, the New York Times said. </p> <p>In Washington today, Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry's campaign said the Bush administration \"must answer for what may be the most grave and catastrophic mistake in a tragic series of blunders in Iraq\". </p> <p>\"How did they fail to secure ... tonnes of known, deadly explosives despite clear warnings from the International Atomic Energy Agency to do so?\" senior Kerry adviser Joe Lockhart asked.</p> <p>One US official source indicated that the handover of power to the Iraqis in June this year and the growing insurgency had been a distraction. The official told the New York Times: \"It's not an excuse but a lot of things went by the boards.\"</p> <p>The Iraq Survey Group, the CIA task force that had led the fruitless search for Saddam's alleged weapons of mass destruction, has been tasked with finding the missing stockpile of explosives, the newspaper said. </p> <p>The nuclear agency pulled out of Iraq in 1998, and by the time it returned in 2002, it confirmed that 35 tonnes of HMX that had been placed under IAEA seal were missing. </p> <p>Since then it appears much more has been taken. The New York Times said that of roughly 10 bunkers where the explosives had been held, eight were intact and empty. The type of explosives that are missing are popular among militaries and terrorists because they are relatively safe and stable to transport as they do not explode if impacted.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair today defended the government's controversial gambling bill, denying that it would open the way to a massive expansion in the number of casinos and insisting that it would provide improved regulation and \"better protection for children\".</p> <p>The prime minister also joined the head of the American Gaming Association, Frank Fahrenkopf, in dismissing the allegation that the government had promised the US industry a cut in the level of tax levied on casinos, calling the suggestion \"nonsense\".</p> <p>\"It is very important that we modernise the regulation of gambling for today's world,\" Mr Blair told journalists at his Downing Street press conference today. \"Ninety percent of the gambling bill is actually about better regulation, better protection for children, removing slot machines from around about 6,000 premises where children might get access to it.</p> <p>\"And in return for that we are giving the power to local authorities to grant planning permission for these larger leisure complexes, including casinos, which will probably add around about 20 to 40 casinos to the 120 that there already are in this country.</p> <p>Mr Blair's comments come after allegations surfaced in the Times newspaper that government officials promised the US gaming industry a cut in the amount of tax levied on casinos to encourage them to invest in Britain.</p> <p>The paper quoted Mr Fahrenkopf, head of the American Gaming Association, as saying that officials had told him the tax would be cut from 40% to 15-20%. Today, Mr Fahrenkopf told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that no such promise had been made, saying there was \"no truth to that at all\".</p> <p>\"I have met for the last three years with MPs and members of the government in the US and in Great Britain,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I testified before the parliamentary committee and said that if they want millions of dollars in capital investment from publicly-held casino companies in the US, a tax rate must be set that ensures a fair return on that investment to those companies so that their stock holders will get a fair return.</p> <p>He added: \"But that rate has got to be set by your taxing authorities, and no commitment was made to me by any MP or any member of the Blair government that there was going to be a reduction. I recommended that there be a reduction from present rates, but I got no commitment from anyone.\"</p> <p>Also interviewed on Today, the home secretary, David Blunkett, denied that the cabinet was split on the bill but conceded that there were \"interesting discussions\" going on.</p> <p>\"I'm going to go along with what is sensible policy in terms of government, which is, if we are thrashing out a new bill, and there will always be nuances, I mean that is part of the parliamentary process, we should initially do it in private, and then we should present it to parliament.</p> <p>\"That is the sensible way of dealing with disagreements.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett added: \"Of course we have interesting discussions, because that is how you get good legislation.

  "<p>Supermarket group Morrisons today said it would offload 114 smaller Safeway stores, with rival Somerfield to take control of them in a \u00a3260m deal.</p> <p>Somerfield is buying 63 of the Safeway Compact convenience stores for \u00a3115m. The remaining 51 sites, along with a distribution centre, will be sold to Northwharf Investments for \u00a3145.2m, and leased back to Somerfield. </p> <p>The deal comes just days after Morrisons cheered the City with news that sales were soaring at Safeway stores rebranded under the Morrisons format. The Bradford-based group, which bought Safeway in March, said the disposal would allow it to concentrate on larger sites and speed up the conversion of stores to its own brand. </p> <p>The disposal of the smaller stores - many of which are in Scotland and the north east of England - will see 9,000 staff transferred to Somerfield. In addition, Somerfield will acquire stock and cash floats from Morrisons for around \u00a335m. </p> <p>The move comes as the Bristol-based chain continues to build up its presence in the convenience store sector, following a deal earlier in the year to buy Scottish chain Aberness. </p> <p>The supermarket is funding the deal - which also includes seven petrol forecourts - with new bank debt and \u00a350m raised through the placing of new shares. </p> <p>The deal does not depend on approval from the Office of Fair Trading, although Somerfield may have to sell two stores. Somerfield said the acquisition of the Welwyn Garden City depot in Hertfordshire would boost its distribution abilities in the south east of England. </p> <p>Chief executive Steve Back said: \"This acquisition represents an excellent opportunity for Somerfield to grow its estate without a significant increase in gearing and to capitalise on its proven expertise in operating smaller stores.\" </p> <p>The company is also in the middle of a refit programme involving more than 1,200 shops under the Somerfield and Kwik Save brands. </p> <p>It said today that trading at both chains during September and October was in line with management expectations, although market conditions remained tough. </p> <p>Like-for-like sales, which strip out new openings, were 1.4% higher at Somerfield and 0.2% higher at Kwik Save in the eight weeks to October 9. </p> <p>Morrisons said the sale of the stores would save it an estimated \u00a310.2m in rent every year. Most of the stores being bought by Northwharf are freehold, while the majority of those sold to Somerfield are leasehold. </p> <p>Morrisons said last week that same-store sales at Safeway stores converted to the Morrisons brand were 12.5% higher excluding petrol, while those not yet converted saw a further slump. </p> <p>As part of a separate sale process, Morrisons has sold the bulk of the 52 outlets it was required to offload by competition authorities. Waitrose and Sainsbury's have been among the beneficiaries of that process. </p>",
  "<p>Patrick Vieira today bemoaned Mike Riley's handling of Arsenal's defeat to Manchester United, claiming the referee was to blame for the fracas in the tunnel after the match.</p> <p>The referee awarded a controversial penalty to Manchester United after Wayne Rooney fell in the box, and also failed to react to a dangerous high challenge by Ruud van Nistelrooy on Ashley Cole.</p> <p>The FA has announced it may investigate several of the issues emanating from the game at Old Trafford, including van Nistelrooy's tackle. Should the United striker be found guilty of foul play, he could be hit by a three-match ban.</p> <p>The tackle was one of several flash points during the game which led to a highly-charged atmosphere when the players returned to the tunnel after the final whistle. </p> <p>There it is believed the two teams clashed again, with Arsenal players, most notably Thierry Henry and Jens Lehmann, particularly agitated with Wayne Rooney, labelling the youngster a cheat.</p> <p>Lehmann and his opposite number Roy Carroll are reported to have angrily squared up to each other, before the Arsenal keeper squirted a water bottle at Sir Alex Ferguson and another player apparently threw a cup of soup at the United boss while he was on his way to conduct an interview.</p> <p>A witness to the bust-up said: \"The Arsenal players were enraged by what happened on the pitch and, after an exchange, suddenly a cup of soup went flying in Ferguson's direction. There was so much pushing and shoving that you just couldn't tell who had thrown it.\"</p> <p>Security men managed to break up the argument, though not before Arsenal equipment manager Paul Johnson was accidentally struck on the nose. The Arsenal players were ushered into their changing room and quickly led out of the stadium, still seething.</p> <p>Gunners' captain Patrick Vieira today summed up those feelings, criticising Riley's level of control over the game and laying the blame for much of the trouble at the referee's door. </p> <p>In addition to the penalty decision and the lack of punishment for van Nistelrooy, Vieira was also livid that the referee did not penalise Rio Ferdinand for a first-half challenge on Freddie Ljungberg as the Swede bore down on goal.</p> <p>\"Every time we play here it is the same thing,\" Vieira said. \"It is difficult because only the referee can talk about it, he is the one who makes the decision. </p> <p>\"But he made some decisions where you can ask 'What is going on?', and right now we are quite upset about the way we lost the game because if we had been outplayed we would say they were better than us.</p> <p>\"The decision of the referee to give a penalty changed the game. But we are used to this kind of decision when we play against Manchester United at Old Trafford and we just have to accept it.\"</p> <p>Arsene Wenger launched a particularly scathing attack on the referee immediately after the game, also saying about United's Dutch goalscorer: \"We know how Ruud van Nistelrooy behaves. He can only cheat people - we know him very well.\"</p> <p>These comments are expected to land the manager in trouble with the FA, who are still reviewing Riley's report into the goings-on before they decide what action to take with regards to Wenger, van Nistelrooy and the fracas in the tunnel.</p>",
  "One is a Tory peer. Another was once a mandarin in the Northern Ireland Office. The third is a barrister from Wales with a wealth of expertise on topics from water to the post. <p>As controversy deepened yesterday about the decision to allow a new film depicting real sex to be screened uncut in British cinemas, the three members of the \"presidential team\" at the British Board of Film Classification were facing fierce criticism from MPs and lobby groups and calls for government intervention. </p> <p>The Guardian has learned that Britain's most senior team of censors viewed the film 9 Songs, by British director Michael Winterbottom, before it was passed for distribution without cuts to scenes showing authentic acts of penetration, masturbation and oral sex. </p> <p>The film, to be released in February, was one of the most talked about at the Cannes festival in May. A tale of the relationship between a young couple in London, played by Kieran O'Brien and Margot Stilley, it features 35 minutes of unsimulated sex. </p> <p>From January, the censors are to begin working with new guidelines but these would not rule out passing of films with real and graphic sex scenes. </p> <p>It is understood that following the outcry that greeted the screening at Cannes, 9 Songs was referred to the BBFC's director, David Cooke, for appraisal. </p> <p>A further screening was then arranged for the presidential team led by Sir Quentin Thomas, former political director of the Northern Ireland Office. </p> <p>Sir Quentin, who also held senior roles at the Home Office and Cabinet Office, assessed the film with Lord Taylor of Warwick, the Conservative peer and barrister, who is a vice president, and Janet Lewis-Jones, a lawyer who has served on a string of quangos and public bodies such as the British Waterways Board and the regulator Postcomm. None of the three was available for comment yesterday, but Sue Clarke, the board's director of communication, said the fact that the sex scenes were real had not been the most important consideration. </p> <p>\"That was discussed, but it was not felt there was anything in the film that would need to be cut. It was a question of intent. The intent of a sex film is sexual arousal. That is not the intention behind this film.\" </p> <p>She said public views had been canvassed during compilation of a revised set of guidelines. \"The board doesn't make moral decisions, because what is morally wrong for one person is not morally wrong for another.\" </p> <p>She said the public could formally complain and a few peole had done so. But only complaints from people who had seen the film were likely to be taken seriously. Local councils can prevent films they find objectionable being screened within the territory they con trol. Leading the charge against 9 Songs yesterday was Ann Widdecombe, Conservative MP for Maidstone and the Weald, who urged the home secretary to intervene. \"It seems to me that the board have ignored their own guidelines and this could be against the law,\" she said. </p> <p>\"David Blunkett should intervene and ask the censors to look at it again. It is not the board's role to allow pornography to enter the mainstream. They have a series of options and they are making moral decisions all the time.\" </p> <p>The director yesterday intervened to defend his film and the rating it has received from the censors. </p> <p>In his first interview since the ruling, Winterbottom told the Observer that anyone who enjoys pornography would be disappointed by it. </p> <p>He agreed the film was the most sexually explicit to be made in mainstream British cinema, but added: \"There's not an awful lot of competition.\"</p>",
  "George Bush and John Kerry today enter the final week of a presidential race that is as deadlocked now as it was six months ago. <p>With the country polarised and only a relative handful of voters still undecided, the campaigns have three final tasks: focus on a few pivotal states, mobilise their supporters, and get ready to challenge the outcome.</p> <p>Focusing the campaign involves the hard decision to switch resources from the states they might like to win to those realistically within their grasp. The candidates will narrow their focus to those few battlegrounds, where voters will be subjected to an even heavier monsoon of television advertising by the campaigns and their political surrogates.</p> <p>Both sides acknowledge that all that frantic activity has rapidly diminishing returns. The unfortunate residents of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania have probably seen all the political advertising they can stand.</p> <p>But what matters most this week is mobilisation: the battle to get a bigger proportion of your supporters to the polls than the other side.</p> <p>The Democrats have long prided themselves on their get-out-the-vote prowess, but over the past four years Karl Rove, the president's chief strategist, has built a centralised machine, precinct by precinct, that could erase that traditional Democratic advantage.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, mobilisation has been the game plan throughout modern electoral history, but the searing experience of the 2000 recount has introduced a new element, that could once more make the difference between victory and defeat: the readiness for legal challenges.</p> <p>The Republicans have recruited thousands of volunteers to deploy at polling stations in Democratic districts in swing states to check the credentials of the flood of newly-registered voters expected to turn up on November 2.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Democrats claim to have some 10,000 lawyers on standby to ensure their supporters, particularly new immigrants and minorities, get to vote, and to get to court quickly to declare challenges before results are officially announced.</p> <p>It seems likely that what appeared a freak phenomenon in 2000 could become a regular occurrence in an evenly split nation, with the final decisive stage of the battle taking place after election day is over.</p> <p>The sense of deja-vu is increasing already, as the contest boils down to the same small circle of states as last time.</p> <p>The Kerry campaign, buoyed by the southern charms of its vice-presidential candidate, John Edwards, had ambitions only a few months ago of mounting a serious challenge in traditionally conservative heartland states like Virginia and North Carolina. Those ambitions have been abandoned and the Kerry camp has also pulled its forces out of Missouri, repositioning them in the remaining dozen states still in play.</p> <p>Similarly the Bush campaign has closed its operation in Washington state, where it had hoped to score a surprise win. But the president is enjoying a surprise surge in Michigan, a blue-collar, traditionally Democrat bastion, which is now back on the swing-state list.</p> <p>If the shift to Mr Bush on election day is big enough to win a state like Michigan, then the game is up for Senator Kerry in any case.</p> <p>But assuming he can beat the president there, he will have to win two of the three big remaining battleground states: Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, to take the presidency</p> <p>It is a question of arithmetic. The goal is to amass 270 votes in the electoral college, a body consisting of delegates, or electors from each state, whose numbers are roughly proportionate to that state's population. In all the big swing states, electors are allotted on a winner-take-all basis.</p> <p>At the moment, both John Kerry and George Bush can count on about 200 electoral college votes each, leaving 135 up for grabs. Of those, Florida accounts for 27, Pennsylvania 21, and Ohio 20.</p> <p>Four years ago, Al Gore was trailing by a few points in most national polls, just as John Kerry is today, but on election day itself, as Democrats never tire of reminding the country, Mr Gore won half a million more votes.</p> <p>That last-minute turnaround, Republicans agree, was a direct result of the Democrats' superior capacity for mobilisation, relying on foot-soldiers from the unions, environmental groups and the local political machine. This year the effort has been augmented by liberal groups like America Coming Together, which have exploited a loophole in the campaign finance laws to raise money independently of the parties and their fundraising limits.</p> <p>This year, however, the Democrats will be matched by a meticulously constructed network of Republican volunteers in every voting precinct, in which local \"precinct captains\" have been set ambitious goals for recruiting voters and transporting them to the polls on election day.</p> <p>Yet the Republican machine is untested. Its ability to deliver on its promise to match the Democratic turnout will only become clear when the dust settles after election day.</p> <p>It is quite possible that the dust will not settle for quite some time after November 2. The Democrats are convinced that if they had been better prepared for the court battles that erupted in Florida, with more lawyers on hand to fly down to the flashpoints in Miami, Palm Beach, Tampa and Tallahassee, Mr Gore would have won the day. They are not about to make the same mistake again.</p> <p>But the Republicans are ready for them, convinced that the Democrats have bent the rules in the race to register new voters.</p> <p>Rather than calm denouement that polling day has traditionally been, next Tuesday is likely to witness skirmishes between lawyers and activists on both sides at polling stations across the nation. Those battles will inevitably spill into the courtrooms and stay there, as the conservative columnist George Will put it, until \"Bush or Kerry finally gets 270 electoral votes, perhaps in May\".</p>",
  "President Bush's campaign in Florida, which handed him victory in 2000, took a blow yesterday when two of the state's newspapers failed to endorse his candidacy. <p>The Orlando Sentinel, which has not endorsed a Democrat for president since Lyndon Johnson, opted for John Kerry.</p> <p>\"This president has utterly failed to fulfil our expectations,\" an editorial said.</p> <p>\"We turn now to his Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry, with the belief that he is more likely to meet the hopes we once held for Mr Bush.\"</p> <p>Another Florida newspaper, the Tampa Tribune, chose not to endorse either candidate. It is the first time since 1952 that the paper has not backed the Republican candidate for the presidency.</p> <p>Campaigning on Sunday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Mr Kerry sought to address the criticisms directed at him by some Catholic bishops, who have attacked him for his support of abortion rights.</p> <p>\"I know there are some bishops who have suggested that as a public official I must cast votes or take public positions - on issues like a woman's right to choose and stem cell research - that carry out the tenets of the Catholic church,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"I love my church; I respect the bishops; but I respectfully disagree. My task, as I see it, is not to write every doctrine into law. That is not possible or right in a pluralistic society.\"</p> <p>In Colorado, another swing state, the Denver Post endorsed President Bush, citing the \"war on terror\" as the crucial issue. In 2000 it backed Al Gore, but despite misgivings about Mr Bush's performance since taking office, it decided to endorse Mr Bush.</p> <p>\"Decisiveness is a crucial characteristic in the showdown with the nation's elusive enemies,\" an editorial in the paper said. \"We believe he meets the test, and we aren't sure about John Kerry.\"</p> <p>In a pre-recorded television interview due to be broadcast today, Mr Bush pushed home his message that America needed to stay on the offensive in the war on terror.</p> <p>\"Whether or not we can be ever fully safe is up - you know, is up in the air,\" he told Fox News. \"I would hope we could make it a lot more safe by staying on the offensive.\"</p> <p>The Washington Post came out for Mr Kerry yesterday, albeit with reservations.</p> <p>\"On balance,\" the paper said, \"we believe Mr Kerry, with his promise of resoluteness tempered by wisdom and open-mindedness, has staked a stronger claim on the nation's trust to lead for the next four years.</p> <p>\"We do not view a vote for Mr Kerry as a vote without risks. But the risks on the other side are well known, and the strengths Mr Kerry brings are considerable.</p> <p>\"He pledges both to fight in Iraq and to reach out to allies; to hunt down terrorists, and to engage without arrogance the Islamic world. These are the right goals, and we think Mr Kerry is the better bet to achieve them.\"</p> <p>Mr Kerry's camp claimed that 113 daily newspapers with a total of 14.4m readers had endorsed the Kerry-Edwards ticket, 27 of which endorsed Mr Bush in 2000 - including Mr Bush's local Crawford paper, the Lone Star Iconoclast.</p> <p>Mr Bush had received endorsements from only 70 daily newspapers with circulation of 8.6m.</p> <p>Former president Bill Clinton, who has been recovering from a quadruple heart bypass operation, is due to join the Kerry campaign for an event in Philadelphia today.</p>",
  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer today set the price for its record share buyback above market expectations, at 362p per share.</p> <p>The retailer said demand for the \u00a32.3bn buyback - the largest ever tender offer by a UK company - was oversubscribed, and that allocations at the \"strike price\" would have to be scaled back. </p> <p>The buyback - a fundamental part of chief executive Stuart Rose's defence to July's 400p-a-share takeover bid from retail tycoon Philip Green - was approved by shareholders on Friday. An extraordinary general meeting saw 99.56% of shareholders vote for the scheme.</p> <p>\"I think that this expresses a certain degree of confidence in what Rose is doing,\" said Rebecca McClellan, an analyst at brokers Exane in London. She added that she had been expecting a price closer to the 356p mid-point of the 332-380p range. </p> <p>\"Clearly a lot of private shareholders won't have subscribed but some of the institutions would have put in higher offers, thinking that if they don't get that price the share would trade up there in the short term,\" she said.</p> <p>Shareholders had until Friday to tender a price at which they were prepared to sell. Those offering at or below the strike price will automatically sell their holdings back to the company for cancellation, while those who tendered a price above 362p will hang on to their shares. </p> <p>The price set represented a 5p premium on Friday's closing price of 357p. The shares had eased by 1.25p to 355.75p by noon. </p> <p>The tender offer enables M&amp;S to cut the number of shares in issue by 635.4m shares, or 27.9%, to 1.65bn shares. The move means that investors who choose not to sell will end up with a greater stake in the company.</p> <p>It will also strengthen the position of the \"die hard\" private investors who control more than a quarter of the company and effectively defeated Mr Green's \u00a39.1bn takeover attempt at July's annual meeting.</p> <p>Major institutional shareholders including Brandes Investment Partners - which supported Mr Green's bid - as well as UBS, Deutsche Bank and Cater Allen, will be forced by stock market rules to declare changes in their stakes within the next few days. </p> <p>Some will have successfully tendered and see their holdings decline, while others are likely to have sat tight and consequently see their stakes strengthened. </p> <p>M&amp;S chairman Paul Myners said he was \"pleased that the tender offer has been completed successfully\". The oversubscription meant that while all shareholders who tendered offers below 362p will have them accepted in full, anyone who tendered at the strike price will see only 43.4% of the shares they offered for sale repurchased.</p> <p>Iain McDonald of Numis Securities said that some stock held by hedge fund investors and not successfully tendered could find its way back onto the market in the short term and weaken the share price.</p> <p>But he added that in the longer term there was substantial potential for \"bouncebackability\" in the business.</p> <p>\"Philip Green was prepared to pay 400p per share for this business because he thought he could make a large amount of money by doing so. We suspect that many of the measures being followed by Rose and his team are exactly what Green would have done anyway,\" he said.</p>",
  "The first x-ray images of one of the strangest paintings by Degas reveal the 19th century artist's obsessive reworking of an image for over 40 years, most of his painting life. <p>There isn't a ballet dancer, a racehorse or a woman in a bath tub to be seen in The Young Spartans, but something about the groups of adolescent girls and boys shaping up to one another - the children of ancient Sparta, with the rock in the background from which unwanted babies were hurled - haunted the artist. </p> <p>\"This picture is always going to be a touchstone for anyone trying to understand Degas's thought processes and method of working. But in the end it remains a mystery,\" said Christopher Riopelle, curator of 19th century paintings at the National Gallery in London. </p> <p>\"It starts as a traditional historical painting, closely based on classical accounts and meticulous research. It ends as something much more enigmatic.\" </p> <p>The x-ray shows flurries of reworking, as figures become more and less distinct, the teenagers turn towards one another and then look away, the detailed background landscape is softened into a blur. At one point, Degas scrubbed out their classically handsome faces, and replaced them with Parisian urchins. </p> <p>Decades of alterations left a most peculiar painting, still unfinished when Degas died in 1917, which has been in the National Gallery's collection since the early 1920s. The number of girls in the group on the left varied, as the x-ray shows. On the canvas the result is that the four surviving girls have at least 10 legs. </p> <p>Two full scale versions exist of the painting, and an exhibition at the National Gallery will bring them together for the first time since they left the artist's studio after his death, together with scores of preparatory drawings loaned by museums, including the Louvre in Paris. </p> <p>Degas was infamous for meddling with his paintings for years, on occasions even after they had been sold. He kept some canvasses in his studio which he worked on for years or even decades. </p> <p>The other version, which is coming to London from the Art Institute of Chicago, is much less finished, but shows an elaborate architectural background and a much more detailed landscape. </p> <p>Edgar Degas was born into a wealthy French family in 1834, and was regarded even by his friends as eccentric in the extreme. He was a bachelor who lived for most of his life alone with a housekeeper. </p> <p>But despite the years Degas spent backstage at the Paris Opera, then haunted by wealthy older men preying on young singers and dancers, Mr Riopelle can find no evidence of an affair, ever, with man, woman, boy or girl. The Spartans remain as enigmatic as their creator. </p> <p>\"It must be significant that the young bodies are just the same age as the little ballet dancers he painted,\" Mr Riopelle said. \"There must be something about the growing awareness of their own bodies, the dawning sexuality, that interests him. It is not his most attractive painting, but it is endlessly fascinating.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Art in the Making: Degas, at the National Gallery, London, November 10-January 30.</p>",
  "Tony Blair will inevitably face questions about Iraq and the controversial deployment of the Black Watch outside Baghdad at his press conference today. No change there then. But to stop things being too much like groundhog day, he should also be quizzed about the government's plans to sign up to new EU voting mechanisms for immigration policy and for gambling reform. <p><b>Midday</b><br> The prime minister begins proceedings by celebrating the government's record on fighting crime and promising to accelerate the criminal justice process. He announces that certain defendants' past criminal records will also be made known to juries. On Thursday the government will be publishing a report on anti-social behaviour orders, known as Asbos, while next month it will publish a white paper on policing.</p> <p><b>12.10pm</b><br> As usual, the BBC's political editor, Andy Marr, starts the questioning, asking about the expansion of casinos. The prime minister replies that 90% of the gambling bill is about improving and modernising regulation, particular to protect children. However, it will also include changes to the country's planning laws to bring in the \"regeneration\" of casino expansion. </p> <p>He says that the bill will only result in \"20 to 40\" new casinos, and adds that it will allow the government, for the first time, to regulate the industry in the proper way. He insists that it amounts to the \"tightening of regulation\".</p> <p><b>12.15pm</b><br> ITV's Nick Robinson asks about the government \"giving up\" the EU veto on Britain's border controls. Mr Blair disputes this, pointing out that Britain retains an \"opt-in\" to the legislation - allowing it to stay out of measures it does not like - and saying that we will have the \"best of both worlds\". </p> <p>He goes on to say that the introduction of qualified majority voting in immigration allows an improvement of controls across the continent.</p> <p><b>12.20pm</b><br> Asked about the Black Watch's deployment to aid US troops in Iraq, and whether it means the government endorses American action in Faluja, Mr Blair insists that the \"key issue\" is the Iraqi elections in January. If the Iraqis are allowed to elect their own government, that destroys the whole case of the insurgents, he says. He also states that Britain is undertaking a \"limited operation for a limited period\". </p> <p>We have to \"stay firm and see it through\", he concludes. </p> <p>The political editor of the Daily Express asks about Mr Blair's purchase of a multi-million pound house in London, and whether his purchase has been guaranteed by anyone. The prime minister says he has nothing to say other than what has already been said.</p> <p><b>12.25pm</b> Won't allowing juries to see past convictions just increase the number of people in prison? Mr Blair says that the government is trying to \"rebalance\" the criminal justice system to stop people \"playing the system\", seemingly conceding that prison numbers will rise.</p> <p>Mr Blair now has a bit of a bust-up with the Sun's Trevor Kavanagh about whether the government \"rolls over\" to Brussels. The Sun's man thinks it does, Mr Blair disagrees. The prime minister points out that the asylum \"opt-in\" has existed for seven years and hasn't been compromised in that time.</p> <p><b>12.30pm</b><br> Asked about the tax regime for new casinos, Mr Blair says that it's up to the Treasury and describes the Times story that the US gaming industry boss was promised a cut in tax as \"absolute nonsense\". </p> <p>The prime minister is now asked when he is going to start campaigning for a yes vote on the EU constitution which he is set to sign. He insists that he is \"campaigning now\" by talking to the press.</p> <p><b>12.35pm</b><br> Rob Hutton from Bloomburg asks about whether we can put pressure on the Iranians over their nuclear programme when we depend on their oil. The prime minister denies that that is a problem, saying that the government will continue to push the UN nuclear watchdog.</p> <p>He is then questioned on whether he would participate in a joint military action with the US against Iran or Syria. Mr Blair denies that there is any talk of such things and says that negotiations have not been exhausted.</p> <p><b>12.40pm</b><br> Mr Blair now denies that there was a failure of post-war planning in Iraq, arguing that fears about a large-scale humanitarian crisis or Kurdistan seceding have not materialised. What has happened, he adds, is that foreign terrorists have entered the country to stop the creation of a democracy which would undermine their efforts.</p> <p>These people can't be defeated by security measures alone, he says. The biggest blow of the last few months to them is the Afghan election, which shows what we are actually trying to do.</p> <p><b>12.45pm</b><br> The Telegraph's George Jones asks if the prime minister is happy with the way that MPs claim expenses. He replied that he is happy that they have been reported, seemingly not an answer to the question asked.</p> <p>Channel 4 News asks about the government's \"moral compass\" and why the government is intervening more in people's lives in some ways - over diet, hunting, etc - but less in other areas such as licensing and gambling laws. Where is the moral rationale? </p> <p>Mr Blair returns to the issue of the gambling bill, insisting that there is 24-hour gambling at the moment. There is a lot of misapprehension of what is happening here, he adds. </p> <p><b>12.55pm</b><br> The BBC's James Landale asks whether the prime minister thinks that gambling is a good thing or bad. Mr Blair replies that \"gambling goes on\" and that the issue is not whether it is right or not. He insists however that he is not a gambler. After laughter, he conceded that he may be in the political sense. </p> <p>The Times' Tom Baldwin asks if he can remembers anything he said to any of his colleagues that would give them any reason to think he may stand down. No I can't, Mr Blair replies. </p> <p><b>1pm</b><br> Mr Blair is then asked about the Northern Ireland secretary Paul Murphy's optimistic comments about restoring devolution in Ulster. He replied that the chance of a breakthrough is there because the issues now dividing the parties are now \"so well-defined\" and the recent talks at Leed Castle were undertaken in such good spirits. </p> <p>And that's it for another month.</p>",
  "<p>After 86 years of hurt, the Boston Red Sox are halfway towards winning the World Series and finally ending the Curse of the Bambino. For that they must thank Curt Schilling, their veteran pitcher who last night threw six gritty innings with blood seeping out of his ruptured right ankle to give the Red Sox a 6-2 victory and a 2-0 lead in the best of seven series.</p> <p>That Schilling even took to the mound was a medical wonder. The 37-year-old, who became the first pitcher to win matches in three different World Series, dislocated his ankle only two weeks' ago, and has since had doctors suture a tendon in place to hold the ankle together. Last night Schilling hobbled out to the mound to throw 94 pitches, by the end of which his sock had changed colour from white to red - quite fitting really.</p> <p>\"I wasn't going to pitch,\" Schilling said after the game. \"I couldn't walk, I couldn't move. I don't know what happened, but I knew that when I woke up there was a problem.\"</p> <p>Schilling, who is thinking of running for governor of Massachusetts in 2006, pitched six innings, allowing just one run and four hits. Having won 21 games in the regular season, as well as one in both the Division Series and the AL Championship Series, he has gone a long way to securing plenty of New England votes.</p> <p>Red Sox reliever Alan Embree, who replaced Schilling in the seventh inning and promptly retired the side, paid tribute to the ace afterwards: \"You can't put into words what he's done. Gut check after gut check, especially with the way his ankle has responded. The doctor has done a great job, he's been through a lot of pain. I can't say that I've been there. What he's done has been truly amazing.\"</p> <p>Despite having won their last six games and being two up in the series, the Red Sox realise it is far from over. They haven't been crowned world champions since 1918 when they sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees. The Babe, widely accepted as the greatest ever player, supposedly left a hex - the Curse of the Bambino - on the Boston club, since when the Red Sox have suffered one enormous blunder after another whenever they edged near to the holy grail.</p> <p>After completing the greatest comeback the sport has ever seen when they overcame a 3-0 game deficit to the Yankees for the ALCS, the Red Sox know that it would be another cruel twist of ironic fate - or, if you are superstitious, of the Curse - for the Cardinals to mount their own revival.</p> <p>With the World Series extravaganza now moving to Busch Stadium in St Louis, where the Cardinals have won all their post-season matches, the competition is far from over.</p> <p>The Cardinals batting line-up will need to improve quickly with Red Sox legend Pedro Martinez taking to the mound for game three. The star-studded team only managed five hits last night, with Larry Walker, Scott Rolen and Jim Edmonds failing to record a hit in 11 at-bats.</p> <p>Conversely, it did not take long for the Red Sox bats to fire. Starting pitcher Matt Morris performed adequately, but sometimes there is no answer to the Boston sluggers. </p> <p>So it proved last night. In the first inning, Morris made the glaring error of issuing walks to Dominican Republic duo Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz, with Jason Varitek taking full advantage by driving both runners home with a triple.</p> <p>The Cardinals halved Boston's lead in the fourth inning when third baseman Bill Mueller fumbled a groundball from Reggie Sanders, allowing Albert Pujols to score. Mueller was guilty of three fielding errors last night, making it an unbelievable eight for the team in the two games played so far.</p> <p>The Red Sox hit back immediately though. Mark Bellhorn, who was roundly criticised for his post-season slump before he crunched a crucial home run against the Yankees in game six of the ALCS, again demonstrated why manager Terry Francona has shown him such support with a two run-double.</p> <p>When Orlando Cabrera - who continues to outshine his Colombian shortstop counterpart Edgar Renteria - batted in runs for Trot Nixon and Jonny Damon in the sixth inning, Schilling was able to hand over to the bullpen to close the job. Embree, Mike Timlin and Keith Foulke achieved this with aplomb, the game ending 6-2.</p> <p>Whether Schilling will be required to pitch again in the series - he is due to start in game six if indeed there is a game six - could all depend on tomorrow night's events in St Louis. Should Martinez silence the manic Cardinals support, the Red Sox will surely have an unassailable lead. Then again, while the Curse of the Bambino is around, nothing is certain.</p>",
  "The worst thing for Captain Jennifer Machmer was knowing that the US army had actually promoted her rapist. Four years in the military, from proud passing out at West Point to humiliating discharge, had provided an education into the Pentagon's thinking on sexual assault in the ranks, but Machmer never expected an accused rapist to be rewarded. <p>Her story, narrated to a hushed Congressional committee chamber in April this year, was a rare first-person account of the dangers faced by women soldiers during the Iraq war from their fellow troops. With thousands of women on the front line of America's war on terror, the Pentagon has been forced to acknowledge that female soldiers are at risk from their comrades in arms, and that, in the US military, rapists often go unpunished. </p> <p>As Machmer's experiences in uniform reveal, the culture of violence runs deep. In her first command, she was nominally in charge of a soldier who regularly abused and threatened her. Machmer had the soldier transferred, and he was punished with a \u00a3475 fine. In her second posting, in 2002, the military chaplain she was seeing for marriage counselling sexually abused her. Machmer opted for discretion, and did not file a complaint. </p> <p>Later, in Kuwait during the run-up to the American invasion of Iraq in early 2003, she was raped. \"There was no way I could file away another violation,\" she told the congressional committee. After asking herself, \"do I stay quiet and just suck up the life that has been ruined, or do I speak out and try to go back to that route I was on,\" the captain reported the attack within 30 minutes. Then she watched her career implode. Under the narrow definition of military law, the assault was not considered rape - though it would have been under a criminal law in most states. </p> <p>Machmer was discharged against her wishes, on a partial pension because of post-traumatic stress disorder. Her assailant was transferred to a prized post. \"The aftermath of the report has been terrifying,\" she told the Congressional women's caucus. \"Every time you turn around, you are re-victimised, and retraumatised.\" </p> <p>It has been 10 years since the Clinton administration opened up 90% of military jobs to women. More than 200,000 women now serve in the US military, with at least 15,000 stationed in Iraq. Some of the women who put on the uniform and went off to war came home as heroines, like Private Jessica Lynch, whose capture by Iraqi forces was spun by the Pentagon into a tale of military derring-do, or Rachel and Charity Witmer, who returned to their grieving parents in Wisconsin in April after a third sister was killed in Baghdad. Lynndie England, a young soldier from a poor town in West Virginia, became instead the symbol of the ugly American, grinning and giving the thumbs-up to scenes of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison. </p> <p>As now seems clear, the Pentagon could not sustain its military presence in Iraq without women soldiers. However, activists say the military establishment has done little to protect its female troops. As the committee hearing broke up, Machmer told reporters that she came to trust the Iraqis more than her fellow soldiers. </p> <p>As in the civilian world, the greatest threat comes from known colleagues, says Christine Hansen, director of the Miles Foundation, an independent advocacy organisation for victims of violence. \"Predominantly, we are seeing that these are acquaintance rapes, that the victims and the alleged assailant know each other. It might be your battle buddy, or a friend of your battle buddy who is in another squad.\" </p> <p>As of September this year, the Miles Foundation had received credible reports of rape or sexual assault (in the period August 2002 to August 2003) from 243 women serving in the US military in Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain and Afghanistan. An additional 431 instances of assault were reported elsewhere. No figures are available for the rape of male soldiers serving in Iraq, although campaigners say there are such cases. Meanwhile, the Miles Foundation says it has charted a sharp increase in reports of domestic violence among military families with soldiers returned from the war. </p> <p>Hansen believes the reported rapes account for just a fraction of the attacks. Most of the known victims were senior non-commissioned officers or officers - which Hansen says suggests that junior personnel are even more afraid of coming forward. </p> <p>And who could blame them? A woman who reports a rape often suffers hazing (humiliation) and retaliation. She may be forced to continue serving with her attacker. In extreme cases, she may be thrown in the brig [military jail] and be accused of sexual misconduct. \"It's a career ender,\" says Louise Slaughter, a Democratic congresswoman from New York and leader of the women's caucus. \"The sad thing is that, in addition to everything else, we are losing brain power, and people who would be extraordinary soldiers.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the US military has become notorious as an institution reluctant to confront a culture of abuse. Since 1991, when 83 women were assaulted at the annual Tailhook pilots' convention, the Pentagon has had ample evidence of the abuse of women within the ranks. In 2002, a civilian rape-crisis centre near Sheppard air base in Texas saw two dozen new recruits who were victims of assaults. Last year, the national air force academy was shaken by reports from women cadets of rape and humiliation that went unpunished by their superiors. During the last Gulf war, 8% of women sent overseas were sexually assaulted or raped, according to a study by researchers for the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Other surveys of women soldiers have confirmed the trend; sexual assault is widespread, and there are rarely consequences for the assailant. According to the Miles Foundation, fewer than 3% of reported assaults result in courts martial, let alone punishment. </p> <p>That was Sheri Chance's experience after she was drugged and sexually assaulted by a navy recruiter in February 2001. \"The last conscious thing I remember is that I hit my head,\" she says. She woke up in the recruitment office in Peru, Illinois as the assault was underway. Chance reported the attack when she arrived at boot camp. After a one-day trial, the man who attacked her was fined one month's pay. Chance was discharged from the navy. \"When all of this started happening to me I thought I was the first. Now it seems like it was constant all the time,\" she says. </p> <p>Over the years, the Pentagon has launched repeated investigations into sex scandals. When the first reports of sexual abuse of women serving in Iraq emerged, the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, ordered an official inquiry. Last month he appointed female officer Brigadier General KC McClain, who investigated rape cases at Sheppard air base two years ago, to head a new joint task force for sexual assault prevention and response. </p> <p>But advocates say that such fact-finding missions are a substitute for real change. \"We have known for a long time that there is a problem with sexual assault in the military. There have been more than 40 surveys in 16 years,\" says Carolyn Maloney, a New York congresswoman, \"yet sexual assaults have gone up 19% since 1991. What is very frustrating is that the military has allowed these problems to get worse. What we have to do is to move past the acknowledgement that there is a problem and try to address it.\" </p> <p>In recent months, women's organisations have pressed the Pentagon for reform, demanding amendments to military law to encourage prosecution for assault, and urging new procedures in the war zone. By the Pentagon's admission, the US military's record on sexual assault, from protecting victims and their privacy to prosecuting assailants, is \"inconsistent and incomplete\". </p> <p>In a report issued in May, the Pentagon noted that there was no uniform definition of rape or sexual harassment under military law. The military had also failed to institute widespread sensitivity training for commanding officers, or to make counselling services available to women who had been assaulted. It is not even properly equipped to investigate such crimes: in the war zones of Afghanistan and Iraq, fewer than 100 rape-detective kits (which collect crucial DNA evidence) have been distributed to field hospitals. The backlog for DNA testing in rape investigations is 16 months, and overstretched commanders are disinclined to investigate reports of assault. </p> <p>That was the experience of Beth Jameson, a major in the US army reserve, who was assigned to a large staging area in Kuwait. She was raped on March 20 2003, the first night of the war, in the shower block during an alert for a feared chemical attack. In May this year she told ABC television: \"I donned my mask and my chemical suit, and my gloves, and my boots, everything. So I stayed there and waited for the all-clear sign to come about. Well, then all of a sudden there was a knock on the bathroom door. And the door opened and somebody said, are you OK? And I gave my thumb up, saying, yeah, I'm fine. And the door shut. And then, it seems like a split-second later, the door just flew open and this person jumped in. He turned on me, kneed me in the groin and pushed me in the back of the bathroom. He pushed me to the ground and I fought with him.\" </p> <p>She soon became convinced that the authorities were not interested in a prosecution. The investigators asked repeatedly if she had been having an affair with her attacker. She was also told that military regulations did not permit investigators to match the semen sample against the DNA registry of US service personnel, which is maintained to identify remains. </p> <p>Major Jameson told ABC: \"I'm just angry now at the system - the military system that won't protect the victim. I understand now why women don't bring forward the fact that they've been attacked - because they're made to be the victim again.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday October 26 2004</strong></p> <p>In the article below, we say \"in March 1997 [Kevin] Keegan took Newcastle back to Liverpool and lost 4-3 again\". The Newcastle manager for that game was Kenny Dalglish. The error was introduced at the editing stage. </p> <p><br>On the day Kevin Keegan finally does choose to retire they should fill this stadium and stage a seven-goal thriller that he actually wins. </p> <p>Keegan gave Newcastle United fans times they will never forget and yesterday he brought Manchester City here to give Geordies another Sunday afternoon epic they will long remember. </p> <p>It was at Anfield in April 1996 that Keegan's Newcastle lost 4-3 to Stan Collymore's last-minute winner. The game was voted the Premiership Match of the Decade, though it was a stern nail in the coffin of Newcastle's title ambitions that season. </p> <p>Six months later Newcastle commissioned commemorative mugs to mark the 5-0 home win over Manchester United but in March 1997 Keegan took Newcastle back to Liverpool and lost 4-3 again. </p> <p>Newcastle were duly labelled \"CarToon\" and Keegan mentioned Disneyworld after yesterday's game. He did so at the end of a lengthy diatribe against the referee - Keegan did all but call Steve Dunn a \"homer\" - and there was something cartoonish about yesterday's second half. </p> <p>That is when all seven goals came, City coming back from 2-0 and 3-2 to level before losing to Craig Bellamy's 89th-minute winner. </p> <p>It almost had to be Bellamy after the week he has had - and Graeme Souness still took him off before the end. This time there was no reaction from the player towards his new manager but St James' Park stood to applaud their explosive Welshman. Keegan, meanwhile, sat on the bench looking as if he had seen a ghost from seasons past. </p> <p>Keegan had been raging at Dunn long before, to the extent that even Souness advised Keegan to regain some calm. But Keegan entered the press room to say: \"Astonishing? Yeah, if you look at 4-3 and get carried away with it. The astonishing thing is that the referee wasn't strong enough and got so many decisions wrong.\" </p> <p>Keegan then went through a number of perceived errors and said all he wanted was \"a little bit of fairness. They have gone 2-0 up by default almost, no disrespect to them. I'm not taking anything away from Newcastle. I hope under Graeme they go on and achieve what we failed to achieve.\" </p> <p>Keegan said that he had visited the referee's room to inform Dunn of his opinion. At the same time Souness was addressing his players: \"Some of you may not know, I've had open-heart surgery,\" Souness told them. </p> <p>During a first half nearly devoid of incident - Lee Bowyer had a 39th-minute shot cleared off the City line by Paul Bosvelt - few hearts were pumping. </p> <p>But four minutes after the interval Laurent Robert stepped up to clip a free-kick over the wall and leave David James flat-footed. Keegan did not think Bosvelt had fouled Nicky Butt for the kick to be given. </p> <p>Seven minutes later Butt and Alan Shearer harassed Steve McManaman and Ben Thatcher into mistakes and suddenly Stephen Carr was side-stepping James. Not even Souness thought James touched Carr but Dunn pointed to the spot and Shearer made it 2-0. </p> <p>Now Shaun Wright-Phillips took control. On the ground where he made his England debut against Ukraine earlier this autumn he pulled one back from the same position he scored from then. </p> <p>Two minutes later Robbie Fowler, a half-time replacement for Nicolas Anelka, fell under a challenge from Butt. Again Dunn thought it a penalty when the evidence was dubious. Fowler rolled in the spot-kick. </p> <p>Keegan's agitation on the sideline was rising and he was furious when Dunn judged Sylvain Distin to have brought down Jermaine Jenas. Inevitably, from the Robert free-kick, Robbie Elliott made it 3-2 with a backward header. Elliott celebrated by pretending to be a chicken. </p> <p>Back came City. Wright-Phillips hit the side-netting when he might have equalised and, as Newcastle's defence evaporated, Wright-Phillips did make it 3-3 after a throw-in by Distin came off Jenas. </p> <p>There were 12 minutes left. When City's lively teenage substitute Willo Flood burst through Newcastle tackles, Fowler was clear on the left. But Flood chose to shoot instead. </p> <p>It was a choice Flood, Keegan and City would regret - especially Flood because after Shearer had squandered a good opening Flood was charged at by Olivier Bernard and lost out. </p> <p>The French left-back had supplied Bellamy with the cross to score against Charlton the previous Sunday and now he did so again. Bellamy controlled the ball, then volleyed into the far corner. It was another 4-3, another defeat. Keegan's distress was complete.</p>",

  "Councils have reacted with delight to government reassurances that new costs incurred under the Freedom of Information Act will be reimbursed \"in full\" by central government. <p>Local authorities were concerned over the financial implications of implementing the act, which from January will enable the public to request information held by 100,000 public authorities - including councils - after the government gave way over threats to charge a fee for a majority of public requests for information.</p> <p>Lord Falconer, the secretary of state for constitutional affairs, changed tack by signalling there would be no charge for information that cost public bodies less than \u00a3450 to produce, leaving councils with the prospect of having to fund the requests.</p> <p>But Lord Falconer set the record straight when he told a Society of Editors' dinner that the government would fund councils in full under \"the new burden doctrine\" - a pledge made to councils by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, that any extra duties imposed would be comprehensively funded by Whitehall.</p> <p>Lord Falconer told dinner delegates: \"For local government we will reimburse councils for any additional costs, in 2005-06 and beyond, falling on them as a result of the Freedom of Information Act. This is the right approach, and it confirms our commitment to making open government available to all.\"</p> <p>The Local Government Association welcomed Lord Falconer's statement, and said it was now in discussions over reimbursements for costs already incurred. </p> <p>\"We are working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs to identify future costs of implementing the freedom of information act,\" a spokesman said.</p>",
  "The Americans have asked us to send 850 troops to one of the hardest-fought areas of Iraq. The response of the British left has been disgraceful. <p>A significant proportion of Labour backbenchers has argued that we should refuse - for two reasons which seem almost as dishonourable and removed from reality as George Bush's reasons for starting the war in the first place.</p> <p>I didn't want this war to start, and I expect it to end in ignominious retreat from a devastated country. But we're there now. And if our army is to fight at all, it should be fighting in the front line - as much of it already is. The purpose of this redeployment is to free up the American troops for their impending assault on Falluja. This is bad news for the hapless residents of Falluja; it's also a confirmation of bad news about the American army. If it is really so overstretched after 18 months of victory that it cannot find an extra 600 fighting soldiers (the rest are support troops), then it shouldn't have gone there in the first place. But we all know that now.</p> <p>The question is what is to be done to get out of Iraq. Hanging back, and claiming that we don't mind the war too much so long as we don't get our soldiers killed, cannot be the answer. Yet that is the position that much of the left has argued itself into.</p> <p>The first objection of many MPs seems to be that our troops will die as a result. They will. But that's still not a good enough reason to refuse the American request. Anyone who argues for the move must face the fact that it will mean the loss of British soldiers who probably would not otherwise die.</p> <p>The generals and politicians involved know this already. I suspect it weighed more on the politicians than the generals. It's not that generals are harder hearted; they probably feel the deaths of soldiers more. But they know what their men joined up for, and in a volunteer army men join to fight, and to take the risk of being killed.</p> <p>As far as one can judge from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1326609,00.html \">Audrey Gillan's wonderful articles on the territorial army in Iraq</a>, the soldiers themselves are rewarded, not punished, with dangerous deployments. That's where the promotion is found. All they ask is that this be done in a just cause, in a way directed with reasonable competence.</p> <p>You may argue that the army in Iraq is taking part in an unjust war, directed with startling incompetence. It's a hard case to argue against. In an ideal world, we shouldn't be in Iraq at all. But we are. We have to make the best of the mess, and that means hoping that the elections in January will produce some kind of government that has a chance of bringing order and then legitimacy to the country, and of averting civil war. The elections may yet collapse. Without the occupying armies, they won't take place at all.</p> <p>This is pretty much Kofi Annan's position: the war was unjust, but the international community must now deal with the consequences and help Iraq away from anarchy. That means soldiers getting shot at, and shooting back. Unless the left renounces war altogether as an instrument of policy, it has to be prepared for soldiers to die and to kill - often in rather stupid situations.</p> <p>The worst argument advanced against the redeployment was that it would be helpful to the Bush re-election campaign. If anyone really thinks that British troop movements greatly affect the minds of American voters, they shouldn't be let anywhere near foreign policy. It is yet another example of the grotesque overestimation of our importance in the scheme of things which helped get us into this mess in the first place.</p> <p>The Germans or the French would be very wrong to announce that they were sending some troops of their own to the war under the inspired leadership of President Bush. That might help him get re-elected. But we can no longer make that gesture, and merely shifting our forces so that we take some otherwise American casualties won't be noticed at all in the US campaign.</p> <p>There is one final, cynical twist to this argument. Low political cunning would suggest that the opponents of this move want Tony Blair out of office and punished for the war. That is far more likely to happen if every week the papers are filled with stories of fresh British casualties in George Bush's war. If Mr Blair wants to write \"home by Christmas\" on his tombstone, is it really the job of the opposition to stop him?</p> <p>* Andrew Brown is the author of The Darwin Wars: The Scientific War for the Soul of Man and In the Beginning Was the Worm: Finding the Secrets of Life in a Tiny Hermaphrodite.

  "<p>The Conservatives will today reopen the debate on university access with a Commons motion urging the government to ban the new Office for Fair Access, drop its benchmarking of student profiles and stop riling university bosses over admissions.</p> <p>The strongly-worded motion on admissions, ahead of a debate later today, immediately drew a furious response from the lecturers' union Natfhe, which said academic achievement should not be the \"sacred imperative\" of university admissions. </p> <p>The row was sparked last month after the method for \"benchmarking\" the proportion of state school pupils admitted to universities was reformed. The changes came under attack from the Russell group of elite universities, most notably Oxford. The president of Trinity College, Michael Beloff, demanded that the government \"take its tanks off Oxford's lawns\" otherwise the university would be forced to privatise. </p> <p>The argument pitches the government's target to widen participation at university to 50% of the 18 to 30 population, and to make sure a sizeable chunk of those are from backgrounds with no tradition of higher education, against university bosses who are vehemently protective of their independence and accuse the government of forcing them into positive discrimination.</p> <p>The Tory motion reads: \"This house believes that universities should be solely and wholly in charge of their own admissions policies, without regard to any externally imposed quotas, targets or benchmarks; affirms that access to higher education should be determined on the basis of academic merit, not social, economic or geographical background.\"</p> <p>It goes on to note the \"deep-seated anger and resentment\" among universities at government policies and \"urges the immediate abolition of the Office of Fair Access and the removal of state interference from issues which lie at the heart of university independence, freedom and standards\".</p> <p>However, the national higher education official for Natfhe, Liz Allen, said: \"It is entirely wrong to imagine that HE admissions are currently somehow based only on intrinsic merit and not influenced by social or economic background. Students from wealthier backgrounds currently have a much greater chance of getting to prestigious universities than poorer rivals. University admissions are badly distorted now.\" She added: \"Academic merit should not be the sacred imperative for admissions policy. A combination of achievement, potential and ability to benefit from a course should be taken into account. Many courses in higher education prepare students for professions in which academic excellence may be important, but it is rarely the only quality required.\"</p>",
  "Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat is pumped. Two weeks ago, sitting in an internet cafe on Munich's Odeonplatz, the software marketer who crafted a hugely successful voter registration website, pulls up numbers that show a remarkable spike in Americans overseas mobilising to defeat George W Bush. Between her site and another out of Hong Kong, Democrats have registered 140,000 new voters, 40% of them from swing states - and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Americans abroad, roused to a boiling fury by a Bush doctrine that has smeared America's good name across the globe, are looking like the \"silent swing vote\" in several key battleground states. Overseas registration for both parties is up by 400% over 2000; estimates put the tally of possible civilian votes as high as 2 million. <p>Then the panicked emails start flooding in. Today, less than two weeks before the tightest presidential race in memory, untold thousands of overseas voters still have not received their ballots - and clearly won't be able to get them back in time. Late primaries and legal challenges to Ralph Nader's appearance on the ballot delayed mailings from half the battleground states. In swing states, including Florida, Ohio and New Mexico, different versions of the ballot have gone out, sowing wild confusion. In Pennsylvania alone, at least three versions were mailed overseas, in successive, chaotic waves - with Nader and without him, plus a blank one-size-fits-all ballot with no names at all. </p> <p>Activists now fear that huge numbers of Americans overseas - both military and civilian - may be as disenfranchised as they were in 2000, when anywhere from 10 to 40% of overseas ballots, depending on the county, just plain never showed up. But, far from helping civilians, the Federal Voting Assistance Programme (FVAP) has dragged its feet. A small liaison office based in the Pentagon, the FVAP provides voting materials to the departments of defence and state for soldiers and civilians abroad, and preaches overseas election law to thousands of local election officials back home. </p> <p>The Government Accountability Office excoriated the agency for losing thousands of overseas votes in 2000, but the FVAP insists it has corrected its problems this year. Frustrated civilian advocates, however, say the FVAP remains biased and ineffective. Despite reforms, they attest, it still has not shaken its Pentagon roots: It spends the bulk of its energy getting out a heavily Republican vote among half a million service people - but has failed the far greater numbers of civilians (an estimated 4 million, by most counts) who tend to vote a different way. </p> <p>The tsunami of overseas civilian voters this year has only made the inequity more glaring. The agency was overwhelmed by a flood that has clogged its fax lines, telephones and email. It has blocked access to its website to civilian voters abroad, given military voters access to electronic ballot-request systems that civilians cannot use, and subcontracted sensitive election work to a company with strong Republican ties. For months, it failed to heed requests from the state department to post an emergency substitute ballot on its website that will mainly help civilians living far from consulates and military bases. Finally, on October 21, with only 12 days till the election, it will post a downloadable version of the federal write-in absentee ballot, known as FWAB: a last-ditch device intended for the precise situation in which thousands of overseas voters now find themselves. </p> <p>Those who've busted their guts to get out the overseas civilian vote on both sides are relieved but still angry. \"Considering 2000 and the fact everybody knew this was going to be a close race, they should have seen it coming,\" says Joan Hills, co-chair of Republicans Abroad. \"The obstacles that have been thrown up are incredible,\" says Jim Brenner, executive director of AOK (Americans Overseas for Kerry), an arm of the Democratic National Committee. Samuel F Wright, director of the Military Voting Rights Project of the National Defence Committee, and a Navy Reserve officer who has spent 25 years observing the FVAP, says: \"Frankly, I'm not impressed with them. They're sort of going through the motions. I've been pinging on DoD for four years that this is the perfect situation for the emergency ballot.\" Voters who have requested but not received their ballot by now can dispatch the FWAB in its place. (If the real ballot subsequently arrives, election officials are required to discard the FWAB and count the regular ballot.) </p> <p>A million hard copies of the FWAB have been sent to military bases in Germany and Asia and to the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan - two for every member of the military, Wright says - who surely deserve them. But on the civilian side, the record is spottier. The state department, charged with helping civilians overseas, ordered its consulates and embassies to stockpile the form. But Democrats Abroad reports that many have been caught short-handed and that direct voter requests to the FVAP have gone unfulfilled. In one pathetic twist, employees of DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart had to beg forms from the military at the gate of the base last week, a voting officer said. </p> <p>Because so much hangs on key states, and on the possibly widespread use of an untested, little-known ballot, the potential for disaster is enormous. \"If this election is close, 2000 is going to look like a cakewalk,\" says Margo Miller, a London-based lawyer for AOK. \"It's going to be so messy in so many places, the fact that the FWAB hasn't been easier to get is inexcusable.\" </p> <p>The Pentagon responds that the two major parties began asking for the online FWAB only in late September and that it has moved \"mountains of bureaucracy\" to get the form online. Starting now, the tiny bureau of 14 civil servants in suburban Virginia will get the word out to election officials in 3,142 American counties that the downloaded version of the write-in ballot is good to go. </p> <p>But the programme's record does not inspire much confidence. Indeed, voters contacting officials to ask about the ballot have been shocked at the ignorance they've encountered. In Nepal, one embassy worker said the ballot could be mailed from the United States, which it cannot; in Chester County, Pennsylvania, an election supervisor had no idea what it was. Says Wright of the Military Voting Rights Project: \"Nobody has ever heard of it. The FVAP does show up at meetings and presentations, but I bet a lot of the 5,000 election officials don't go to those meetings, judging from the very basic questions we get back.\" </p> <p>While waiting for the FVAP to act, both parties gyrated over the internet. AOK put up its own version online with the disclaimer that no one knew if such ballots would be accepted; Democrats Abroad and the two main registration websites did not. Republicans Abroad then snitched the AOK form, without the disclaimer, and put it on its site, only to shamefacedly pull it off when told that, until the FVAP formally approved it, nobody could use the darn thing. AOK finally sent out 25,000 hard copies at its own expense to voters from swing states who'd signed up on the Overseas Vote 2004 website. </p> <p>The overarching problem is the scant resources allotted civilian voters, who outnumber the military overseas by at least eight to one. While all applaud the goal of making sure men and women fighting for our country can exercise their right to vote, civilians point out that they are Americans, too. And the FVAP has a history of favouring the military, not least because the department of defence has a captive, easily identified audience and far more money and muscle than the state department. Citizens abroad are far harder to find than soldiers: Embassies have direct contact only with a small minority of those who have registered to be alerted and evacuated in case of a disaster - though one might call mass disenfranchisement a disaster of another degree. </p> <p>Highly publicised missteps this year have hardly restored faith in the FVAP. Civilian voters still have trouble getting through to the agency and are barred from the email ballot request-and-delivery website that is available to soldiers from ten states. More worryingly, a pilot email voting system signed on to by Missouri, Utah and North Dakota, in which soldiers can email ballots to a contractor that then faxes those ballots to local jurisdictions, is being operated by Omega Technologies, headed by a former Republican Party donor, according to the New York Times. </p> <p>The Times also reports that earlier this week two Democratic members of Congress, Henry Waxman of California and Carolyn B Maloney of New York, asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the FVAP. Among their concerns is that the agency's online ballot-retrieval system is not open to most civilians abroad. </p> <p>Miller, the AOK lawyer, says the FVAP, which moved only two years ago from the Pentagon department that buys soap and toilet paper into the personnel department, \"is basically focused on the military and doesn't care\". A department of defence insider involved in getting out the vote overseas puts it more harshly: \"The senior military leadership will only admit they have a responsibility to help civilians get involved in elections if you force it down their throat. They're only interested in the soldiers.\" </p> <p>The Pentagon denies these charges. As each misstep has occurred, deputy undersecretary of defence Charles Abell has defended the FVAP, saying it is making a heroic effort to reach all citizens overseas through voting workshops and toll-free telephone numbers. Indeed, all observers agree that the FVAP has gone to extraordinary lengths this year to get out the military vote. Still, Democrats suspect that in the case of the online ballot, it's no accident that the agency did not move faster: The measure mainly benefits civilians, many more of whom will support John Kerry than their counterparts in the military. </p> <p>Dzieduszycka-Suinat frets darkly that \"higher up, someone is saying: 'Make sure there are problems.'\" From the perspective of Wright, from the Military Voting Rights Project, political pressure is a given. \"When Clinton was in charge, they tried to suppress the military vote for that very reason,\" he says. \"I would not disagree,\" he says, that politics this year, too, plays a role. Faced with a voting programme that at best is ineffective, and at worst partisan, ordinary citizens have been forced to pick up the slack. Wright's organisation, for instance, blitzed the country's election offices with faxed alerts telling them how to process the write-in ballot. And it is thanks mainly to the efforts of two smart groups of expatriates that tens of thousands of new voters made it through the registration process at all. The FVAP distributed millions of registration postcards, but without help, the complex rules daunted many civilians. </p> <p>The state department, stretched thin by new visa regulations imposed after 9/11, has nowhere near the resources in its consulates to help citizens that the department of defence has deployed for its soldiers abroad, a high-ranking official said. Though it has done its best to walk civilians through the 369-page \"Black Book\" of state-by-state election rules, \"we literally don't have the staff to be able to do this,\" the official said. The upshot: There is a military voting assistance officer for every 30 to 50 soldiers, but the onus is on the civilian to fill out the form alone. </p> <p>Democrats Abroad thus began the campaign season camped at card tables on foreign street corners and screenings of English-language movies, walking voters one by one through the Byzantine process. In late May, Dzieduszycka-Suinat and Mitch Wolfson, head of AOK Germany, looked at each other and said, in the words of Wolfson: \"There has to be a better way.\" In July, they took the federal registration form, simplified it, and lobbed it into cyberspace. Beyond the 140,000 mostly Democrats who registered online, another 170,000 physically registered through Democrats Abroad, according to John McQueen, the group's international campaign chair. Thousands more signed up through another clever website, the Amsterdam-based Tell an American to Vote. </p> <p>What infuriates AOK more than anything else, though, is the vast disparity in money and energy between the military and civilian efforts. Overseas civilians, who turn out at half the rate of the military, arguably need more help, they say. While FVAP spent its $5.5m budget mainly to reach half a million soldiers - a ratio that works out to $11 per vote - the Democratic National Committee spent $50,000 on a website that worked out to less than 75 cents a vote. </p> <p>Republicans eschewed pavement-pounding and bought dozens of ads in the military Stars &amp; Stripes, International Herald Tribune and English-language papers in key countries like Mexico, Canada and Israel, which together host some 1.5 million eligible American voters, says Hills of Republicans Abroad. Registrations are up fourfold over 2000. The Bush campaign is focused on large communities of American retirees overseas and counting on its traditional bases among businesspeople abroad and the military, where, Hills says, \"we're very confident we're going to get a strong majority\". </p> <p>Which way these hordes of new voters go is, in fact, the big overseas question - assuming they get to vote. Democrats and Republicans alike see gold in both the civilian and military camps. What's undisputed is that the Bush administration has galvanised overseas voters as never before. \"The entire world is against Bush, and we reflect that view that America has lost all its credibility abroad,\" says McQueen of Democrats Abroad. \"I was tired of cringing in the supermarket whenever I spoke English to my kids, knowing how much we as Americans were hated,\" says Dzieduszycka-Suinat. Hills, for her part, reports that many Republicans, angered at what they see as unjust attacks, are coming out in equal droves to support the president. On both sides, stories abound of older Americans, and dual citizens who've kept their American passports, emerging like Rip Van Winkle to vote for the first time in 30 or 40 years. </p> <p>In reality, the political affiliation of these voters is unknown. Both sides claim a 60% edge: Democrats, based on a Zogby study, say that Americans with passports tend to vote liberal. Republicans, meanwhile, cite international business and the conservatism of Pentagon civilian employees and soldiers. Yet both estimates are what military people call SWAG - scientific wild-ass guesses - about a woolly and ever-growing overseas population of civil servants, diplomats, employees of global businesses, students, journalists, artists, academics and, yes, soldiers on the battlefield. </p> <p>Since January, when the Pentagon decreed \"100% contact,\" every officer and enlisted man or woman has had a registration application pressed into his or her hands. Soldiers have been exhorted to vote at daily formation and while watching ballgames on Armed Forces TV, and they are reminded that \"It's Your Future - Vote for It\" on the bottom on their paycheques. After the \"horror story\" of 2000, the military is \"extremely vigilant\" this time around, says Captain Christina Maxwell-Borges, a voting assistance officer at the US Army Installation Management Agency in Stuttgart. </p> <p>At US Army Europe headquarters in Heidelberg, voting activists and Americans who've worked for the Army for decades say ordinary soldiers are more motivated than they've ever seen. Even with the massive deployment of voting officers, a non-partisan citizens group like the NAACP, which conducted registration drives on base, was swamped. \"Often we couldn't keep up with the demand,\" says Billee Manigault, an NAACP volunteer. \"There's a definite interest in participating,\" echoes Charles Keene of Democrats Abroad and the NAACP. \"From almost everyone you heard, it was, 'You better believe I'm going to vote.'\" </p> <p>Despite several recent polls showing staunch support for President Bush among high-ranking officers, soldiers on base and Pentagon civilians active in Democratic politics say the mood in the military is far more mixed. The controversial mission in Iraq has brought a sea change in political attitudes on base, these observers report. McQueen, a retired military civil servant, says, \"You're not seeing the kind of pressure to vote Republican you always had in the past.\" </p> <p>The strong pro-Republican culture that emerged in the military in the wake of Vietnam has begun to splinter, many observers say. A report in the Washington Monthly last year described rank-and-file soldiers, who are disproportionately non-white, working-class and female, as increasingly diverging from an ideologically conservative officer corps. \"For a long time here, Democrats were in the closet,\" concurs Trenton Browne, a military security contractor who works on bases from Heidelberg to Kaiserslautern. \"Now in the lower ranks you hear people speaking openly about their dissent.\" </p> <p>Gauging the overseas vote thus becomes a numbers game. Military turnout at home and abroad is high. More than 60% of soldiers overseas voted in 2000, double the record of expatriates, who turned out at a rate of 37%, according to the FVAP (though in both groups, the number of uncounted votes dropped those figures by at least 15%). Many expect even higher overseas military turnout this year. How many of those 500,000 active duty service people will vote for Kerry, or Bush, is the question. </p> <p>A survey of 4,000 service people, released last week by the Military Times, revealed strong loyalty to the president: 72% of those on active duty would vote for him, and 17% would vote for Kerry. In the view of military analyst Peter Feaver of Duke University, the early traction Kerry had with the troops has been lost by his recent hammering of the war as a \"colossal mistake\". Being a decorated Vietnam veteran doesn't improve Kerry's stock with the \"career military\" people polled by the Military Times, either; in fact, two-thirds hold the senator's long-ago anti-war activism against him. </p> <p>The survey, however, concentrated on higher-ranking service people, and is not representative of the rank and file. Along Heidelberg's main street, off-duty soldiers, some fresh from combat in Iraq, divided evenly between rejecting Kerry because \"he doesn't support the troops\" and supporting him \"because a lot of us feel jerked around\". \"People think the military is totally Republican, and that's definitely not true,\" says one strolling soldier, a burly 30-year-old from Florida. \"There's a lot of different views within the ranks.\" Capt Maxwell-Borges, the Stuttgart voting officer, agrees. \"Surprisingly, it's been really mixed,\" she says. \"A lot of people support Kerry because he's a veteran and says he's going to increase military spending, and others are the more traditional pro-Republicans. But I've been on bases in the past three elections and I have to say that this time [political views] seem a lot more varied.\" </p> <p>No one expects the soldier vote to swing to Kerry, but a softening of Bush's overseas military support could be significant. \"Even 100% military turnout overseas only equals 160,000 additional votes,\" points out Brett Rierson, co-founder of the Democratic Hong Kong website. With activists guesstimating that the overseas civilian haul could be as high as 2 million, a strong showing for Kerry among enlisted troops could neutralise the Republican advantage. </p> <p>In any event, it's unlikely anyone will know until well after November 2. Several states, in a scramble to accommodate overseas voters' late ballots, have extended their deadlines. As it now stands, Florida, Washington, Iowa, Colorado and Illinois allow ballots to be received late, in some cases up to 10 days after election day. The justice department, at the prompting of the FVAP, has sued Pennsylvania to extend its deadline by two weeks as well. </p> <p>Nor will Americans find out how effectively the overseas vote has been handled until \"after the horses have left the barn,\" says Joe Smallhoover, legal counsel for Democrats Abroad. Voting reform passed by Congress in 2002 requires states to track overseas ballots, at long last. But more to the point, Smallhoover says: \"We have to do more than reform the FVAP; we have to reform the whole system.\" Wright, the military voting expert, agrees. He advocates placing the whole overseas voting operation in the hands of the new Election Assistance Commission, a far better-funded agency created by the 2002 Help America Vote act that is supposed to help states improve their equipment and procedures. </p> <p>All this, however, lies in the future. In the meantime, Democrats Abroad has formed a \"rapid response\" team to unsnarl problems voters abroad have encountered with their county election officials. Thousands of lawyers on both sides are renting office space in battleground states, ready to pounce on illegalities in stateside balloting and absentee votes. For now, overseas voters groping their empty mailboxes can only download the write-in ballot, send it in - in the faith that local election officials will accept it - and pray. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Alix Christie is a reporter and former editor of the foreign service of the San Francisco Chronicle</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited</p> <p>\u00a9 Salon.com 2004</p>",
  "<p>Let's get one thing straight before I put the paparazzi in the spotlight. Prince Harry should not have lashed out at a photographer. If he was attacked physically, which appears not to have been the case, his bodyguards should have dealt with it. If he was abused verbally, then he should have ignored it. </p> <p>That said, given the superficial injury to the photographer he is alleged to have struck, the incident appears to have been relatively minor - what football commentators like to call handbags at 10 paces - and it received front page treatment only because it involved a prince. </p> <p>Harry might well reflect on the counter-productive result of his outburst. It provided the paparazzi with an unexpected windfall and gave them hope that, in similar circumstances in future, there may be more royal pay-days. </p> <p>I spoke to several of the photographers who waited outside the Pangaea nightclub, and their stories tallied. They denied that the prince was provoked - certainly, no one heard anyone taunt him about the authorship of his A levels, as one report claimed - and all said he suddenly lost his rag. </p> <p>Well, they would say that, wouldn't they? And those to whom I talked denied a scenario which suggested that one photographer had deliberately annoyed the prince in order that the others could get sensational shots. </p> <p>But, having laid the blame at the prince's door over this specific matter, it does not give the paps a clean bill of health. A pack of shouting, jostling photographers can be intimidating and often requires of its victims an unusual level of self-control. </p> <p>Nor should we overlook the fact that there is nothing to stop anyone - school-leaver, cab driver, ex-convict, anyone - from joining the pack. There is no entrance requirement. </p> <p>\"Independents\", as they are known to the more experienced snappers, are untrained, have no qualifications and are not members of the National Union of Journalists. They do not need to obey ethical guidelines, although in a rough-and-ready manner, the pack's older members do tend to impose some kind of discipline. The minority who know there is an editors' code of practice simply ignore it (especially the clause on harassment) while the majority have never heard of it. </p> <p>When I asked the spokesman at one agency, Big Pictures, whether his cameramen knew about the code, he replied, inexplicably: \"I'm not prepared to comment on that\". </p> <p>Big had three people outside the Pangaea, two staffers and one freelance, Chris Uncle, the lad who suffered a split lip. He is, said his agent, a rookie of only four months' standing. </p> <p>It would appear that there were at least 12 photographers in the pack, and possibly 15. According to one of them, Charlie Pycraft, most of the people there were experienced and sensible, though he conceded that \"rogue elements can cause trouble\". </p> <p>Pycraft sells his pictures through his own agency, YD Image. This kind of link between photographer and agency is common. Jabier Mateo runs his own outfit, Eagle Photos, which also markets pictures taken by a publicity-shy cameraman (note the paradox) who likes to be known only as Niggs. </p> <p>Another agency, Xposure, is run by two brothers. Dan Taylor does the selling while James Taylor, who is just 18 years old, takes the pictures. Xposure was also represented outside the club that night by two other photographers. </p> <p>The relationship between agency and photographer is interesting in itself. Some agencies, such as the reputable Rex Features, do not assign either staff or freelances to stake out clubs, but they sell pictures on behalf of people who do. On this occasion, Rex acted for Steve Dutton, who sometimes uses the name Fox. </p> <p>Stephen Walters, a photographer for Matrix Syndication whose picture took up most of the Sun's front page last Friday, stresses that money is not the only spur. \"Right from school I wanted to be a photographer and I've always wanted to get a page one picture, not for the money, but as an achievement.\" </p> <p>It is clear that there is an element of denial as everyone passes the buck. The old paps blame the new; the agencies blame the paps; the newspapers blame the agencies. </p> <p>In truth, the paparazzi would not survive if editors refused to buy their pictures. They are supposed to check the provenance of those they publish, ensuring that the code was not breached when they were taken. But do they? Perhaps the Press Complaints Commission might like to ask. </p> <p> <strong>Red-top smut risks family fallout</strong><br>There are probably many reasons why the red-top national titles are losing sales faster than others. But let me suggest one for editors and owners to think about and, may I humbly suggest, act on - the red-tops have lost the right to call themselves \"family newspapers\". </p> <p>Parents can no longer feel easy about their children reading recent editions of the Daily Mirror and the Sun because their sexual content is far too graphic. I have previously mentioned the Mirror's lapse in taste by publishing the three-in-a-bed allegations of footballer Stan Collymore. </p> <p>Last week the Sun went further still with a splash about former nurse turned celebrity Abi Titmuss, who was trying to prevent the sale of a pornographic video in which she featured. This was illustrated on inside pages with four stills from the video which I am certain would never have appeared in previous times. </p> <p>The following day, the paper ran a two-page follow-up feature - by \"the Sun's sex writer, Kate Taylor\" - with salacious details about other \"celebrity\" porn films. </p> <p>On another page was a picture of former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson wearing a T-shirt with a four-letter word, which the Sun had covered up. But its caption contained a joke just as lewd. </p> <p>I understand that public taste has changed since I was a tabloid editor, and I am no prude, but these papers are surely alienating as many people as they attract with such material. </p> <p> <strong>Evening classes hold the key</strong><br>The firing of Simon Bradshaw as editor of the Brighton Evening Argus may have more to do with a personality clash at senior level than his paper's performance. We cannot be certain because neither side is prepared to talk. </p> <p>But his departure after a relaunch that has signally failed to stem the sales decline illustrates the difficulties all regional evening paper editors face. What kind of paper should they publish and for whom? </p> <p>Long ago the London Evening Standard took the strategic decision to appeal largely to the middle class. This meant attracting far fewer readers than a popular title, elevating quality (in terms of social class and affluence) over quantity. The readership profile also ensured up-scale advertising. </p> <p>Meanwhile, ailing evenings have gone on trying to serve all classes, all income groups and all age ranges. Now that papers cannot sell on news alone, that has proved a hopeless task and will end with their demise.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Howard made his first visit to Northern Ireland since becoming Conservative leader today and immediately accused the government of \"dogmatic vandalism\" over its plans to end the province's selective education system. </p> <p>Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's education minister in the now-suspended Stormont executive, introduced plans to scrap the 11 plus selection exam, and Labour direct rule ministers are now pressing ahead with a similar agenda.</p> <p>The exam determines whether primary school pupils go on to grammar or secondary schools and Mr Howard said he had no hesitation in backing those campaigning for the retention of academic selection.</p> <p>Many fear the ending of selection will sound the death knell for the grammar schools. Mr Howard said the education system worked in Northern Ireland and should be kept. \"Northern Ireland produces the best exam results in the United Kingdom. Its schools are among the finest we have,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Those who apply to our world class universities like Oxford stand a better chance of getting in than students from London and the south east,\" he added. </p> <p>Not surprisingly two-thirds of people in the province had told the Department of Education's own household survey that they wished to retain the present system, said Mr Howard. </p> <p>Speaking at Belfast Royal Academy, one of Northern Ireland's leading grammar schools, Mr Howard said politicians were implementing their own vision in flagrant contradiction to the will of the people. </p> <p>\"First Sinn Fein, and now Labour are embarked on a course of dogmatic vandalism that threatens to destroy excellence,\" he said. </p> <p>\"So I have no hesitation in joining you, and a majority of people from across the whole community in Northern Ireland, in your campaign to retain academic selection,\" said Mr Howard. </p> <p>He added: \"What counts is what works. I want a country in which people get on, do well, make a success of their lives. I have no time for the politics of envy.\"</p> <p>He accused the prime minister, Tony Blair, of being \"all talk\" when he came to power. \"If he meant what he said, why are schools in England not learning the lessons from schools here? Why, if the government is so keen on people getting on in life, does it not allow schools to control more of their affairs including greater freedoms over which pupils they admit? </p> <p>\"Why shouldn't parents and teachers be able to shape the schools they want, rather than having to conform to some central plan?\"</p>",
  "<p>At the age of 13, students are probably nearer to the age when they played doctors and nurses, than they are to training to become one. Perhaps not any more, however, due to the launch of a new Leicestershire-based scheme which is aiming to put youngsters on an early path to a career in healthcare.</p> <p>The scheme - a collaboration between Leicester, De Montfort and Loughborough universities - will target talented year nine students with an interest in science and who are not from traditional university backgrounds. Over the next five years they will be encouraged, through a program of university visits, hands-on science events and 'e-mentoring', to pursue a career as a doctor, nurse or other health professional.</p> <p>Leicester University has even set aside 20 priority places at its medical school for those who come through the program with the required grades.</p> <p>Jean Baxter, head of widening participation at Leicester University, said the project was aimed at breaking down the barriers of perception that many young people have about jobs in medical care. \"This program is aimed at students who are very bright and would make good doctors, but because of their background think 'I don't know anyone who is a doctor, you have to be posh if you want to do that,'\" she said.</p> <p>The project is aimed at catching students when they are young enough to still form positive impressions of university, she added. \"Talking to kids in year eleven is too little, too late. This is about forming aspirations and expectations. If you get to kids young enough, talk to them and bring them on to campuses, then it becomes part of their experience and they think 'I can do this'.</p> <p>\"They're also at the stage then when they are still able to make choices that will affect their future in significant ways.\"</p> <p>The scheme will involve 100 students from the county's 80 schools and is being funded as part of the government's Aimhigher initiative for widening participation in further education.</p> <p>In its first year the focus will be on making science accessible and fun. One aspect will involve looking at the way that the medical professional is depicted in TV dramas and students will have a session with a scriptwriter from the medical soap, Doctors. They will also receive guidance on making subject choices for GCSE.</p> <p>Throughout their GCSE course students will attend regular science events at the university campuses, where they will be encouraged to take an active role in projects and discussions. They will also have their own 'e-mentor' in the form of a student studying a medical related degree, who will offer advice and encouragement via the internet. </p> <p>The program is planned to continue as participants enter the sixth form. Students who achieve four or more As at GCSE and want to become a doctor will be encouraged to apply to medical school. Those who get the required AAB at A-level and pass the interview at Leicester will gain a guaranteed place on the course, as well as a \u00a31,000 annual bursary.</p> <p>However, the co-ordinators are keen to stress that the program is not just about recruiting doctors, but encouraging young people to think about a whole range of careers in medical care. Students who don't want to go to medical school will be encouraged to consider the courses on offer at De Montfort's nursing school or the sports science programs at Loughborough.</p> <p>Sylvia Langham, widening participation manager at De Montfort University, said: \"The project could just as easily be called: 'Is there a paramedic, or a pharmacist or a haematologist in the house?' It's about raising awareness of the variety of different health care jobs out there, and convincing kids medicine doesn't have to be a purely middle-class occupation.\"</p>",
  "<p>A few small changes to your home and your lifestyle could boost your green credentials and put an extra \u00a3200 back in your wallet, according to a new campaign.</p> <p>Simple measures like sealing up draughts, using a plug in the sink, closing your curtains at dusk to stop heat escaping through windows and turning off lights when you leave the room can make a big difference, according to the Energy Saving Trust (EST). The trust provides free, impartial advice on how to make homes more energy efficient and says that you could knock around a third off the typical \u00a3600 annual household fuel bill as a result.</p> <p>For example, turning your heating thermostat down by 1C could reduce your heating bills by 10% a year and save you around \u00a330 annually. The same goes for the cylinder thermostat for hot water - set the temperature at any more than 60C and you are wasting money. You can also save energy by buying special light bulbs which use up less electricity, and fitting an insulated jacket around your boiler.</p> <p>Along with the government the EST is currently promoting Energy Efficiency Week to encourage householders to get into good habits and make their contribution towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The government is committed to reducing carbon emissions by 60% before 2050, and wants to encourage utility companies to promote energy saving deals to customers.</p> <p>Each year, every household releases an estimated six tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This gas is believed to be the primary cause of climate change. Energy Efficiency Week aims to show householders that with energy efficiency measures, each home could slash this figure by up to two tonnes per year. For example, if everyone owning a chest freezer in the UK switched to an A-rated appliance the energy saved would run UK street lighting for over a year. </p> <p>You could also persuade your workplace to switch off electrical equipment when not in use, re-use and recycle paper and packaging, and encourage your colleagues to cycle, share cars and use public transport to go to work.</p> <p>Other suggestions on saving cash and the planet include: <strong>\u00b7</strong> Avoid leaving televisions, videos, stereos, computers, and cordless phones on standby <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't overfill the kettle before you boil it <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Always close the fridge door, don't put hot food straight into the fridge and defrost your freezer regularly to keep it running efficiently and cheaply<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Always wash a full load in your washing machine and use the low temperature programme, bearing in mind that modern washing powders will be just as effective at lower temperatures<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Wring out or spin-drying really wet clothes before putting them into a tumble dryer<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> When using a dishwasher choose the the low temperature programme, and ensure you wash a full load </p> <p>And there is another incentive for taking a fresh look at the way you use energy in your home.

  "<p>Richard Desmond has launched a blistering attack on his media enemies, declaring he took a personal \u00a340m gamble on the Express and has waited 30 years to profit from his business empire. </p> <p>Just a day after it was revealed that he paid himself \u00a346m last year, he says people have underestimated the personal financial risks he has taken to get this far.</p> <p>\"There has been disproportionate media attention to my own remuneration - I put it in!\" he wrote in today's Media Guardian. \"What they don't report is that I am finally realising a return after investing for over 30 years.\"</p> <p>Writing in the Media Guardian today, the owner of the Daily Express and Daily Star defends his business methods and claims to have \"shown the doubters a thing or two\" by increasing turnover of the papers by more than \u00a3100m.</p> <p>He says he gambled \u00a340m of his personal fortune and risked OK! magazine as collateral when he bought the Express group four years ago.

Not just as cost-cutters either.\"</p> <p>And he reveals that he is personally involved in controlling the daily operating costs. \"It's well known I like efficiency and hate cash leakage, and with my finance director and managing director I sign off all the monthly payments because that's the best insight into the detail of a business you can have.\"</p> <p>He says that with 2,000 employees at various offices, his Northern &amp; Shell group of companies has made \"a remarkable contribution to the economy\".</p> <p>The turnover of the newspaper group has risen from \u00a3240m to \u00a3340m, Mr Desmond says, with the magazines recording an increase of similar proportions.</p> <p>But it is clear the media mogul feels he does not get the credit he deserves as an enterprising businessman, who felt he was excluded from the \"old boys' network\" when embarking on a publishing career 30 years ago.</p> <p>He also takes a sideswipe at his rival at the Daily Mail-owner DMGT, Lord Rothermere, whom Mr Desmond calls \"Little Johnny\" and at the sluggish Office of Fair Trading.</p> <p>And he admits that he still thinks his mission on earth is to teach what he considers are the anti-semites at the Daily Mail. </p> <p>He jokingly threatens to swamp the Mail by offering the Daily Express newspapers for a penny and \"put a \u00a35 note on the front\".</p> <p>He contrasts his own risk-taking attitude - \"my philosophy is gamble only half of what you can afford to lose\" - with \"guys who are playing with other people's money, maybe like Little Johnny, who has nearly a billion pounds in debt\".</p> <p>Mr Desmond is embroiled in a battle to break up DMGT's monopoly on London newspaper distribution, and is awaiting the OFT's verdict on his complaint against DMGT, which was lodged in May last year.</p> <p>\"I have a great new product with everything in place, but I've come back to that old problem,\" he writes. \"An establishment competitor, who doesn't even make a pretence of using it to the full, sews up distribution. </p> <p>\"Having observed the procedures the Office of Fair Trading has to work within I think if I had a monopoly I'd feel quite relaxed. The process is so slow a would-be competitor could go skint while he was waiting for them to decide.

  "<p>The biggest bandwagon in North America is rolling. With one victory already secured and another expected to be delivered late last night courtesy of the best pitcher in baseball, the 2004 Boston Red Sox are seriously in danger of ruining forever the club's reputation as the biggest losers in sport. </p> <p>In front of a nation fully expecting them to fall flat on their faces, as well as 35,000 hometown fans waiting for the worst to happen, a team that has proclaimed itself \"nothing but a bunch of idiots\" surprised everyone - including, possibly, themselves - by getting off to a winning start in this year's World Series. </p> <p>An eighth-inning two-run home run by Mark Bellhorn around midnight on Saturday night was enough to give the Sox an 11-9 victory at Fenway Park over the St Louis Cardinals in game one of the seven-game series. More significantly, it also instilled belief in the city of Boston that, finally, the Red Sox can win the World Series for the first time since 1918. </p> <p>Curt Schilling, who produced a performance for the ages last week when he pitched against, and beat, the New York Yankees in the American League championship series with blood oozing from a badly damaged ankle, was due to pitch last night against the Cardinals' Matt Morris in game two. He will be followed to the mound in games three and four by Pedro Martinez and Derek Lowe - both of whom are pitching aces running into peak form, both of whom have justifiable expectations of holding the Cardinals' mighty bats in check. </p> <p>Insularity being the trademark of sport in the US, the first team to win four games earns the right to describe itself as - the non-participation of the rest of the world notwithstanding - \"world champions\". Boston, it need hardly be said, is in a state of foment at this prospect. Or as the Globe's estimable sports columnist Dan Shaughnessy put it yesterday: \"Local enthusiasm for this team has gone past unbridled.\" </p> <p>He is right. \"Beloved\" barely captures the city's feeling towards the Red Sox, just as \"tortured\" barely describes the psyche of those devotees - known throughout the world as the \"Red Sox Nation\" - who cram into the team's Fenway Park day in, day out through the summer months. After winning the World Series five times in 17 years up to 1918, the Red Sox have failed to win it again in 86 subsequent attempts. </p> <p>The explanations for this prolonged losing streak range from the prosaic (the Sox have the misfortune to be in the same league division as their bitter rivals, the mighty Yankees), to the fatalistic (one of the most popular T-shirts around Fenway declares \"Anybody can have a bad century\"), to the other-worldy -the much-discussed Curse of the Bambino, in which the famed slugger Babe Ruth is said to have put a spell on the club as a punishment for selling him to the Yankees at the end of the 1919 season. </p> <p>The latter is superstitious nonsense, of course, but just to make sure the current owners, who bought the club three years ago, published a mission statement that included the promise, in bold typeface, \"to end the Curse of the Bambino\". </p> <p>Whatever the truth, Red Sox teams down the years have usually found a way to lose important playoff matches. Most infamously, the club was one out away from winning the 1986 World Series when their first baseman Bill Buckner allowed a ball to dribble through his legs to give the New York Mets victory. </p> <p>It would be fair to say there were echoes of Buckner's ineptitude throughout Saturday's win, with the Red Sox performance marred by four fielding errors - they had made only two in the previous 10 games. The chief offender was the left-fielder Manny Ramirez, whose failure to catch a routine fly ball allowed the Cardinals to tie the game at 9-9 in the top of the eighth inning and send a cold shiver of deja vu pulsing around the Fenway stands. For once, it wasn't to be. </p> <p>Boston's phlegmatic manager Terry Francona, who has raised the art of understatement to new levels during his side's playoff run, said afterwards: \"That was not instructional video stuff. We did some things wrong, but we persevered and we won.\" </p> <p>That they did was primarily down to a murderous batting line-up, not least their slugger David Ortiz, who hit a two-run homer in the first inning, then batted in a run in the seventh. That gave Boston a 9-7 lead. </p> <p>After Ramirez's fumble and Bellhorn's homer, Boston's relief pitcher Keith Foulke struck out the Cardinals' Roger Cedeno to send the actor Ben Affleck, the writer Stephen King and the singer Steve Tyler - just three members of the Red Sox phalanx of celebrity supporters - home happy. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the post-match celebrations were tempered somewhat by the death of a college student during celebrations of Boston's victory over the Yankees last week. Victoria Snelgrove, aged 21, was hit in the eye by a pepper-spray gun pellet fired by police as they tried to control rowdy crowds. </p> <p>Her death led to increased security around Fenway Park following Saturday night's game, although the city's mayor abandoned plans to stop bars and pubs near the ground selling alcohol on Saturday night in an attempt to control the fans' enthusiasm. </p> <p>After long negotiations, bar owners agreed to monitor how much their patrons drink. Needless to say they will need eyes in the back of their head, and elsewhere, should the Red Sox end 86 years of agony some time later this week.</p>",
  "<p>Sachin Tendulkar won the latest of his 114 Test caps against Pakistan in Rawalpindi six months ago, which is an aching eternity for the cricket-potty folk of India, even though he has missed only two matches in that time. </p> <p>So when the little maestro picked up a bat here yesterday and immediately started striking the ball with enough power and timing to make passing rickshaw-wallahs flinch, the attractive ground that is the glory of the Vidarbha Cricket Association exploded into a frenzy of anticipation.</p> <p>A VCA spokesman confirmed that ticket sales for tomorrow's third Test against Australia had trebled since Saturday, when it was reported that the batsman would be fit to play.</p> <p>The strength and audacity of his strokeplay in the nets yes terday, though, came as a surprise because Tendulkar, who until recently had not picked up a bat for eight weeks because of his problems with tennis elbow, had been practising with a lighter implement.</p> <p>\"I am not in pain but there is a stiffness there,\" he said afterwards. \"But I've come through some very tough, intensive practice sessions and my body has reacted well.\"</p> <p>When Tendulkar starts his first match in this series tomorrow, which he is expected to do, India will be getting more than merely a great player. The team, indeed the entire country, will be lifted by the sight of this deity in flannels.</p> <p>Australia, meanwhile, leading 1-0 at the halfway point of this four-Test series, have been savaged enough times by Tendulkar's bat to know that, even if he is not quite at his best, life from here on in could get a tad trickier.</p> <p>Shane Warne recently described Brian Lara as the third best batsman in the world - \"behind Sachin Tendulkar and daylight\". And he was speaking for the entire team.</p> <p>The key question is whether the great batsman, who has not played any cricket for more than two months, can make an immediate impact after such a lengthy lay-off, and whether he has properly recovered from his muscle wastage.</p> <p>The team physio Andrew Leipus has given the thumbs-up and Anant Joshi, the sports doctor who is the head of the Indian board's medical panel, has even said the player could use his usual heavy bat. Tendulkar, however, suggested that he would use a slightly reduced bat.</p> <p>Tendulkar seems likely to replace Yuvraj Singh, who looks too loose to play at the top of the innings, with the wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel moving up the order to open with Virender Sehwag.</p> <p>The pitch at this attractive ground, meanwhile, is the subject of fevered speculation.</p> <p>\"It feels like being home in England, don't it,\" said umpire David Shepherd, and the groundsman declined to use the heavy roller after the official had ambled about the square for a while.</p> <p>The VCA are an admirably autonomous lot and when it comes to pitch preparation they do not like being leaned upon by the nobs from the Board of Control for Cricket in India. This surface is well grassed and there will be plenty of bounce and carry for the likes of Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie.</p> <p>The curator Kishore Pradhan said yesterday that he had no intention of removing the grass covering. Meanwhile Shashank Manohar, president of the VCA, said that he had received no instructions from the board or the team management - \"and even if I do I am not going to oblige them.\"</p> <p>But it must be said that all this was yesterday morning, with the Test still two days away. That can be a long time in politics and Indian cricket and no one would be entirely surprised if this pitch undergoes something of a personality change by the time the captains toss up tomorrow morning.</p> <p>Australia are likely to remain unchanged for this match. They are attracted by the notion of letting Brett Lee's fresh legs gallop into this series, though for now the player must content himself playing guitar and piano at every opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>In an unintentional yet ironically timely show of solidarity, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers faithful staged their own mild protest against Manchester United's owner-in-waiting Malcolm Glazer. Though not as militant as some of their similarly disgruntled United counterparts, some Buccaneers supporters underlined their frus- tration at Tampa Bay's dismal start to the NFL season by voting with their feet yesterday. </p> <p>An embarrassing scattering of empty red seats, whole vacant rows in some sections of Raymond James Stadium, greeted a team that had won only once in five games as they faced the Chicago Bears. This time last season the Buccaneers were defending world champions and the hottest ticket in town. Less than two years after winning the Super Bowl the Glazer family has directed its team's own downfall through a series of dubious decisions that will certainly concern United supporters.</p> <p>The successful and popular general manager Rich McKay was replaced by Bruce Allen of the Oakland Raiders and many fan favourites on the field were allowed to leave in favour of ageing veterans. The results, or lack of them, have annoyed some fans, who admit United might find themselves in a similarly alarming position if Glazer becomes their new owner.</p> <p>\"I'd be worried if I was a Manchester United fan because I think his interest is in business rather than the sport itself,\" said the Buccaneers fan and Tampa native Jim Freeman. \"His interest is in winning also, but mainly because it increases the worth of the business.\"</p> <p>Manchester United fans are, indeed, worried and they took their battle with Glazer to the heart of Old Trafford before yesterday's match with Arsenal. Some 3,000 staged a noisy march outside the ground with a \"Not For Sale\" banner as other supporters flooded into the club's Megastore and refused to leave, blocking aisles and check-outs in the hope of damaging United's turnover.</p> <p>Then, as the teams returned after the interval, an effigy of Glazer was dangled from the Stretford End with a banner warning him that his interest in United could seriously damage his health.</p> <p>The protests came on the day a senior figure in the Glazer camp denied rumours that the American tycoon planned to sell Old Trafford and then lease it back as part of the financing package for a full takeover. \"There are no plans for a sale and lease back of Old Trafford,\" he said. Nevertheless, the denial will do little to quell the fans' anger.</p> <p>Back here in Tampa Freeman was among thousands of fans upholding the American sports tradition of picnicking in the parking lots of the Buccaneers' home stadium. Their expectations were focused on enjoying an afternoon basking in the baking Florida sun rather than hoping for victory.</p> <p>\"We might have won the Super Bowl but what have we got now?\" added Freeman. \"We're 1-5. As a sports fan I hope that doesn't happen to Manchester United.\"</p> <p>In a calculated effort to deflect interest away from the anticipated protests by Shareholders United, the Glazers' PR consultants Brunswick arranged for Allen to meet British reporters pursuing the story. \"I can't say enough good things about them or this organisation,\" said Allen of his employers. \"I'm an American football guy, so I wouldn't be involved in their soccer plans, but they're successful for a reason. They know how to build a successful sports franchise.\"</p> <p>There was, however, no sign of the elusive owner. \"I'm told he never misses a game,\" explained an ambiguous Buccaneers spokesman.</p> <p>\"I don't think they're even strong [American] football fans,\" said Freeman. \"They're into the pride of ownership and the involvement you have as an NFL owner, which is a very exclusive club. It's a power thing. As far as soccer goes I don't think they're any more interested in Manchester United than I am.\"</p>",
  "<p>When I started out in business over 30 years ago I had a great publishing concept, a fantastic team, a full advertising order book, and a ground-breaking new music magazine on the stocks ready to send to the printer. Looking for a distributor, I encountered for the first time the old boys' network, the alliance between vested interest and complacent apathy. \"The magazine wouldn't work\". \"It hadn't been done before, so it couldn't be done now\". \"You have no track record\". It seemed I'd be finished before I began. Then one independent distributor saw the potential. We launched International Musician in 1974, and within a few short years we had a worldwide network of music magazines and were branching out into the computer, motoring, cycling, fitness, cooking, environmental, adult and other specialist titles that carried us through the 1980s. </p> <p>That was how I became a publisher. When I left school at the age of 15 I had planned to be a professional drummer but my family thought otherwise and lined up an interview with Clerical Medical and General Insurance Company. I failed the interview because I had no qualifications and took to music magazines because they linked my love of music with my aptitude for business. Then, in the early 90s, the opportunity came to sell some specialist magazines for \u00a320m. My board and I faced a decision. Should we go for the mainstream and invest half the gain in making good our claim to be Britain's leading independent media group, or take it easy and spend the dosh? </p> <p>We went for it. Why only half the gain? Because my philosophy is gamble only half of what you can afford to lose. It's perhaps different for guys who are playing with other people's money, maybe like Little Johnny [Harmsworth, Lord Rothermere] who has nearly a billion pounds in debt. Over the next few years we steadily invested - or lost - our fighting fund. At the time you don't know which. Then I had to break my own rule and put in more money. It took from 1992 until 1999 to make OK! the market leader and profitable, and even longer to reach our present position of often outselling our rival by two to one. We also launched the subscription-based Fantasy Channel which took a mere four years of investment to turn a profit. </p> <p>Then, in 2000, we were anticipating about \u00a320m ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) and I was looking forward to taking a bonus for a change. Enter the Express deal. Instead of taking the bonus I had to put back \u00a330m and add a personal guarantee of another \u00a310m. OK!, the other magazines and the channel were also put up as collateral. All this on a business that respected analysts had said was finished and newspaper pundits said we could never control even if the regulators allowed us to keep it. Certainly Little Johnny and Big Connie [Lord Black] were most effective in portraying me as some kind of marauding monster, not, of course, that either of these gentlemen ever influence their own editorial! In addition, banks, paper suppliers, politicians, TV companies and advertisers were all subjected to a campaign of vile lobbying against me by various parties that persisted for the first two years. </p> <p>Now, four years on, we've shown the doubters a thing or two. We've beaten all predictions. Not just as cost cutters either. Of course it's well known I like efficiency and hate cash leakage, and with my finance director and managing director I sign off all the monthly payments because that's the best insight into the detail of a business you can have. In four years we have increased the turnover of the newspapers from \u00a3240m to \u00a3340m and that of the magazines by a similar percentage, even after the sale of the adult titles, which despite their profile only amounted to less than 2% of our turnover. </p> <p>We now employ well over 2,000 people at our new headquarters at Number 10 Lower Thames Street and various other premises including Broughton printers and West Ferry printers in partnership with the Telegraph Group, our Scottish offices, our Dublin joint venture with Sir Tony and Gavin O'Reilly, and our TV operation in the Docklands where we have just launched a shopping channel (Sky and NTL channels 637 - don't miss it!). In addition there are, of course, the indirect employees, freelancers and suppliers which add up to thousands more. For cost cutters we make a remarkable contribution to the economy. </p> <p>Until Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay, we were the only fully private company in newspapers, so there has been disproportionate media attention to my own remuneration - disproportionate because they always talk about it when it goes out but never when I put it in! What they don't report is that I am finally realising a return after investing for over 30 years. </p> <p>We are as successful as we can possibly be. The Daily and Sunday Expresses show increased revenues and market share and Daily Star circulation has reached around double the year 2000 figure, bucking every known media trend. Similarly with the Daily Star Sunday, which we launched two years ago and which, including the Irish edition, now tops 600,000 copies. OK! is dominant in the UK and I look with pride on its launches in China, Australia and the Middle East. New! magazine (ABC 400,000) and Star magazine (over 200,000 weekly sales after just one year) are both showing a profit - if only it had been that quick with OK!. The next venture is a new shopping magazine planned to rival the most upmarket productions of Cond\u00e9 Nast and NatMags. Our new City of London HQ is state of the art and I take a genuine pleasure when staff tell me how good it is to work in a pleasant environment. </p> <p>Which brings us to the present, the London evening paper, and shades of 1974. I have a great new product with everything in place, but I've come back to that old problem. An establishment competitor, who doesn't even make a pretence of using it to the full, sews up distribution. Having observed the procedures the Office of Fair Trading has to work within I think if I had a monopoly I'd feel quite relaxed. The process is so slow a would-be competitor could go skint while he was waiting for them to decide. Perhaps we should launch without distribution just to prove the point. We're still outsiders, and apart from Rupert Murdoch who continues to achieve so much by questioning established wisdom, the media old boy network remains a force. I was amazed when Channel 4 recently dropped a planned documentary about Little Johnny. I have no idea why they did that but I wish they'd done that for me. Nevertheless, I can't complain. I'm living the dream, my readers, advertisers and suppliers are my friends and supporters. I've even been made a Ludwig drum endorsee for getting the kit out again to do charity gigs. And after all, it's only rock and roll.</p>",
  "<p>Financial journalists will be sleeping a little easier this week. For last Tuesday, in a libel action against the Financial Times, a judge in the High Court struck out a claim for damages so massive that it might have imperilled the very future of the newspaper. The claim, brought by City stockbrokers Collins Stewart, was based on the supposed fall in the share price of the company after the article complained of was published and was found to be wholly unarguable. But, offering more general encouragement to the press, it appears clear that the courts will robustly resist clever ruses to re-inflate libel damages to their previously penal levels. </p> <p>One of the saner developments in libel law over the past decade has been the marked reduction in damages awards. Once there was a bonanza in the libel courts with claimants regularly walking away with handsome fortunes. In 1987, Jeffrey (later Lord) Archer recovered \u00a3500,000 from the Daily Star over allegations that he slept with a prostitute. Similarly, in 1995, Graham Souness was awarded \u00a3750,000 from the People by a jury regarding allegations from his ex-wife (the sum was, in fact, reduced substantially when he appealed). But since then there has been a striking decline in awards in defamation cases, driven by several judicial innovations such as informing members of the jury in libel cases of the (much smaller) amounts which are customarily awarded in personal injury claims. As a result, few libel claimants nowadays recover more than \u00a350,000 and the courts have suggested that there be an absolute limit for normal damages awards in libel actions of \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>But sometimes in libel claims, particularly where the claimant is a company rather than an individual, attempts are made to circumvent these new restrictions on damages. This is because it has long been held that any claimant in a libel action can not only be compensated for the harm to his general reputation and the distress arising from the publication of the matter complained of (both of which are inherently impossible to value precisely) but also, for any proven actual out-of-pocket loss suffered because of the publication. For example, if a claimant company in a libel case can show that it lost a lucrative contract because of a defamatory allegation, it should be able to recover damages for the profit it has lost if it succeeds. Such recoveries are known in the jargon as \"special damages\". </p> <p>Commercial entities sometimes use this principle to seek to recover huge amounts in libel actions despite the considerably more parsimonious damages regime. For example, in 2002, Oryx National Resources, an African diamond company, brought a claim for \u00a312m from the BBC when it wrongly suggested that the company was connected to al-Qaida. The company claimed that it could show that this was the loss of profits on sales directly due to the report in question. The claim was finally settled for \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>But even this substantial claim was dwarfed by the one brought by Collins Stewart against the FT. The stockbrokers sought in part to recover damages from the FT on the basis of a fall in its share price when, it argued, judged by the performance of its rivals, the share price should have risen sharply. This, the argument ran, suggested a decline in value of the company due to the article of a cool \u00a3230.5m. </p> <p>There seemed a simple answer to this. The FT pointed out that the drop in the share price - even if it could be solely attributed to the FT article (which they strongly denied) - did not mean that the company had lost anything. The loss was to its shareholders who were not suing. The company, they argued, could not seek damages in respect of a loss it had not itself suffered. </p> <p>Ah, responded Collins Stewart, the FT had misunderstood. It did not seek to recover the fall in share value as a loss it had suffered itself. Rather, the fall reflected a precise assessment by shareholders of the long-term damage to the company's income and profits due to the article complained of. </p> <p>This suggested an absolute faith in the omniscience of those trading in the company's shares to foresee precisely the effect of the article on the company's future performance and Mr Justice Tugendhat was having none of it. He considered that the share price of a company was driven by many factors, including market sentiment, and it could not be taken as an infallible barometer of its future sales performance. Moreover, there was no guarantee that the movement in the share price was due to the article. Disentangling this factor from the myriad of other factors which might have driven the share price up or down would be an impossible task. </p> <p>This is not only an encouraging decision for the media but the timing of it is significant as well. The application was made in the relatively early stages of the litigation. It would have been easy for the judge to allow the claim to stand until the damages stage of the action. That he chose to strike it out at this stage shows not only that he thought it a weak claim but also that he realised that having such a ruinous risk hanging over the newspaper and its journalists would be highly undesirable and might unduly pressure the newspaper into settling. </p> <p>The FT, which is edited by Andrew Gowers, is not out of the woods yet. There remains a special damages claim - running into millions of pounds - for actual loss of sales to Collins Stewart allegedly caused by the article. If Collins Stewart succeeds in the action overall (and the FT is contesting that there is any liability), this claim will be assessed later - by a judge and not a jury - but it seems that the court will take a sceptical approach, requiring the company to prove clearly that the business it claims for was lost due to the FT article and not any of the other reporting of the company at the time. The FT's solicitor, Nicholas Alway of Farrer &amp; Co, confirms that \"the losses attributed to the FT's article in the remainder of the special damages claim are also very much disputed\". </p> <p>Reporting serious allegations against major commercial organisations still carries the risk that it will give rise to substantial claims in damages. But the media will be heartened that the courts appear ready to do their utmost to keep such claims within bounds. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Dan Tench is a media partner at Olswang</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps the only thing more surprising than the sheer size of Procter &amp; Gamble's annual marketing budget is that the company rarely says anything about it. Massive but silent, fuelled by the UK's largest main media advertising spend of \u00a3200m, P&amp;G inexorably continues on its mission to market its brands further and further into the hearts and minds of consumers and, of course, their wallets. </p> <p>The scale is enormous. P&amp;G is in every supermarket aisle with brands such as Fairy, Flash, Pantene, Bounty and Crest. More than 80% of British and Irish households buy at least two P&amp;G brands each month, from a portfolio that stretches all the way to Pringles, Vicks, Hugo Boss and Lacoste. </p> <p>At the helm is Roisin Donnelly, UK &amp; Ireland head of marketing and corporate marketing director. \"I think I was born to be in marketing,\" says Donnelly, a 43-year-old mother of three girls aged 3, 5 and 7. \"I used to collect proofs of purchase even when there were no promotions. There was one Christmas when I got my gifts all from consumer promotions. I was eight and a half. My grandmother got a plastic jug from the toothpaste we were using.\" </p> <p>Her mission is to \"delight\" the consumer and get close to her, she says. It is always a \"her\" in P&amp;G land, for as Donnelly says, their research shows that even if it is a male shopper, most decisions are made by the woman of the household. Donnelly's war chest tops the government spend of \u00a3122.8m last year and L'Or\u00e9al's \u00a396m. And the P&amp;G marketing budget for in-store promotions, direct mail, public relations and market research is \u00a3400m. </p> <p>Donnelly projects supreme confidence. She gained an MA in English and studied maths and economics at Glasgow university, where she got the better of future MPs Charles Kennedy and Liam Fox by winning a maiden speaker award. </p> <p>The only time she momentarily appears blindsided is when asked about P&amp;G's famous secrecy. \"It was very much the company philosophy that if we tell you our secrets we would lose the competitive edge,\" she says. But the company has become much more open since AG Lafley became its global head in 2000. Marketers have a heavy presence in its executive ranks. </p> <p>Donnelly, who leads a marketing de partment of 70 and corporate marketing department of 65, says: \"Our philosophy is that the consumer is the boss. They make the purchase decision every day. If we delight her, she will reward us with sales. If we disappoint her, she won't.\" </p> <p>The company is increasing its advertising spend as it launches new products, and it does not shirk the unorthodox. To reach children, its Sunny D brand sponsored the virtual swimming pool on a children's website. To reach young working women, a billboard for its Aussie shampoo sent a competition entry code to their mobile phones. </p> <p>And then there is Maureen McGrath, a Dot Cottonish character from its mini soap opera adverts for Daz, who has just been ruthlessly killed off. </p> <p>\"Poor Maureen,\" says Donnelly. But consumers get to share in Maureen's legacy via discount coupons in Daz boxes. \"Will everyone get their hands on Maureen's millions? Find out with Daz, the soap you can believe in,\" chirps the latest advert, launched last week. </p> <p>\"People have now got used to Maureen and she is now leaving her money to the Daz consumer. It's a brand new way of TV interacting with the consumer,\" says Donnelly. \"We have understood the Daz consumer. She likes Daz, she has a relationship with Daz, but we have taken that to a new level with this soap. She has got more engrossed in the characters.\" </p> <p>And presumably more engrossed in Daz, at the expense of rival brands. Another Daz competition offered shoppers a prize of appearing in a Daz advert. Castings were held in shopping centres. \"They knew the campaign, they loved the campaign, they wanted to be on telly. It's just different ways of making the advertising come much closer to the consumer,\" says Donnelly. </p> <p>That means listening and understanding. If new members of the marketing team for Pampers don't know how to change a nappy, they are sent out to learn. </p> <p>When consumers told Donnelly they wanted advertising to get out of the kitchen, she sent Ridley Scott's son, Luke, to Iceland to film an Ariel advert in which an Eskimo woman washes her baby's jumpsuit in a hole carved out of the ice. </p> <p>Television advertising has been the lifeblood of P&amp;G's marketing, but that is changing. It still spends 80% of its media budget on TV but increasing sums are being spent on other media. </p> <p>Donnelly sees the future of P&amp;G marketing as being all about talking to consumers in different ways. She cites industry research which suggests that viewers used to recall 70% of what they saw on TV, but that has plunged to 41%. A growing focus is interactive advertising, which can be \"red button\" sites on interactive television. </p> <p>For its Flash cleaning brand, P&amp;G organised an interactive site that tied in with the Disney film Lilo &amp; Stitch, offering a film trailer, free toys and a quiz about messy people. Consumers spent an average of nine minutes interacting with Flash on the site - not bad for a household cleaner. \"For somebody to spend that amount of time with TV really surprises us, but interactive TV is a very powerful medium because the woman is in control.\" </p> <p>Word of mouth is just another medium to use to promote products. \"If a consumer uses a product, discovers something new and loves it, she'll tell a friend.\" </p> <p>P&amp;G uses word of mouth to sell Eraser, a new cleaner that removes difficult stains such as crayon from walls. \"We are getting it into the hands of the right consumers, expert consumers, people who chat to a lot of friends. We are sending it to magazines. It has been recommended by the Good Housekeeping Institute.\" </p> <p>P&amp;G targets experts and \"influencers\". If it is selling beauty, it talks to makeup artists and sends products to celebrities in the hope that they will mention them in magazine interviews. </p> <p>For young people, P&amp;G harnesses recently developed instant messaging technology through a system called Tremor. \"We tell the Tremor members about something or we give them gifts or insights or snippets of news and they share it with their friends.\" </p> <p>But for all the money it devotes to market research, Donnelly is negative about the traditional market research focus group. \"I think the biggest mistake is the focus group, where you get a small number of women into a room who have never met each other and they talk for an hour and a half or two hours about a product and an ad. You are paying them and it's a very blunt instrument. I think you would get more from 10 hours with one woman than you would get from one hour with 10 women.\"</p>",
  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer today set the price for its record share buyback above market expectations, at 362p per share.</p> <p>The retailer said demand for the \u00a32.3bn buyback - the largest ever tender offer by a UK company - was oversubscribed, and that allocations at the \"strike price\" would have to be scaled back. </p> <p>The buyback - a fundamental part of chief executive Stuart Rose's defence to July's 400p-a-share takeover bid from retail tycoon Philip Green - was approved by shareholders on Friday. An extraordinary general meeting saw 99.56% of shareholders vote for the scheme.</p> <p>\"I think that this expresses a certain degree of confidence in what Rose is doing,\" said Rebecca McClellan, an analyst at brokers Exane in London. She added that she had been expecting a price closer to the 356p mid-point of the 332-380p range. </p> <p>\"Clearly a lot of private shareholders won't have subscribed but some of the institutions would have put in higher offers, thinking that if they don't get that price the share would trade up there in the short term,\" she said.</p> <p>Shareholders had until Friday to tender a price at which they were prepared to sell. Those offering at or below the strike price will automatically sell their holdings back to the company for cancellation, while those who tendered a price above 362p will hang on to their shares. </p> <p>The price set represented a 5p premium on Friday's closing price of 357p. The shares had eased by 1.25p to 355.75p by noon. </p> <p>The tender offer enables M&amp;S to cut the number of shares in issue by 635.4m shares, or 27.9%, to 1.65bn shares. The move means that investors who choose not to sell will end up with a greater stake in the company.</p> <p>It will also strengthen the position of the \"die hard\" private investors who control more than a quarter of the company and effectively defeated Mr Green's \u00a39.1bn takeover attempt at July's annual meeting.</p> <p>Major institutional shareholders including Brandes Investment Partners - which supported Mr Green's bid - as well as UBS, Deutsche Bank and Cater Allen, will be forced by stock market rules to declare changes in their stakes within the next few days. </p> <p>Some will have successfully tendered and see their holdings decline, while others are likely to have sat tight and consequently see their stakes strengthened. </p> <p>M&amp;S chairman Paul Myners said he was \"pleased that the tender offer has been completed successfully\". The oversubscription meant that while all shareholders who tendered offers below 362p will have them accepted in full, anyone who tendered at the strike price will see only 43.4% of the shares they offered for sale repurchased.</p> <p>Iain McDonald of Numis Securities said that some stock held by hedge fund investors and not successfully tendered could find its way back onto the market in the short term and weaken the share price.</p> <p>But he added that in the longer term there was substantial potential for \"bouncebackability\" in the business.</p> <p>\"Philip Green was prepared to pay 400p per share for this business because he thought he could make a large amount of money by doing so. We suspect that many of the measures being followed by Rose and his team are exactly what Green would have done anyway,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>We've all had that sinking feeling. The MD asks for that report and after much searching, you realise that it is well and truly lost. From the store cupboards to the bin, it is nowhere to be found. Don't you wish you'd mastered the art of record management now? </p> <p>If you think that record management is a skill reserved for medical secretaries, think again. Increasingly, UK offices are realising that good records management can be enough to turn a business from merely competent into a streamlined model of super-efficiency. </p> <p>This will come as no surprise to those working in the public sector. On January 1 2005, the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) will come into force. It is intended to create greater openness and transparency between service providers and consumers and will mean that public authorities must disclose information requested from them by the public, unless the data falls within certain specific exemptions. Moreover, they must do so within 20 working days of the request. This is why detailed information audits have formed the core of the public sector's FoI preparations. If authorities and organisations cannot find requested information, and quickly, they will be in serious breach of the statute. </p> <p>However, the impending implementation of FoI is a sign of the times and of the increasing move towards freedom of information for commercial and non-commercial entities alike and should prompt us all to take the opportunity to review our own records management practices. \"Records are the corporate memory,\" says Stuart Abraham, access manager at the National Archives. \"They have a legal, business and historical value and are the foundation of everything that the business does.\" </p> <p>Authenticity and integrity - records management buzzwords - underpin this. In other words, records management is about more than stuffing paperwork into a filing cabinet. It's about being in control, retrieving documents when you need them and also knowing when it's time to dispose of them. For most office workers it's this that tests the mettle of a filing system, as Vickki Mathurin, office manager at Rainier PR in London, demonstrates. \"I keep all financial records including audit trails and details of client hospitality, media coverage and contracts,\" she says. \"It's an ongoing task. It helps management make decisions, improves client service and even helps us to comply with the law, especially where financial records are concerned.\" </p> <p>Depending on the industry in which you work, and the type of business that you work for, there is a web of legislation on the retention and destruction of information. Limited companies have to retain accounting records for three years while PLCs must hang on to them for at least six years. In addition to this, records relating to pay, sickness and maternity payments have to be kept for three years. VAT and tax records as well as contracts must be kept for six years while health and safety records should have a secure home in the office for at least 12 years. Finally, records relating to hazardous substances, such as asbestos, as well as employers' liability certificates must be retained for at least 40 years. </p> <p>The latter requirement takes records management to a new level. It's no use employing a system that only you know how to handle. The aim should be to create a system of management that can be shared with a long line of future office employees too. \"The problem is that people hoard information,\" says Petra Cook, head of policy at the Chartered Management Institute. \"Large organisations can still have a silo mentality, where departments believe that knowledge is power. They refuse to share information. The result is a company that becomes weaker than their competitors who use their information to their own advantage.\" </p> <p>In the 21st century office, there is no excuse for not making the most of every scrap of information that comes your way. The use of IT networks and email means that information should be available, within the company, to anyone authorised to use it. Electronic files should make filing easier than it has ever been before and reduce the need for extensive paperwork, not to mention speed up the process of retrieval. </p> <p>Dottie Anderson is PA to four general managers at BT and, as if that were not enough to make her a fan of information technology, she also works remotely from her home in Huddersfield. It means her tracking skills are still tested to the limit. \"It is rare that all of us meet in an office,\" she says. \"That is why recordkeeping is vital to what I do. Almost everything I need for my job can be accessed via broadband. Now I can archive information and retrieve it without having to make any physical effort. The best bit is that if I can't find something, I can do a search - impossible with paperwork.\" </p> <p>And therein lies the key. Unless the archived information can be easily found, it's of no use to anyone. Most of us have filed a document in the most obvious place, never to be able to lay hands on it again. One of the most common causes of this is not tailoring your records management system to the needs of your employer. The A-Z method may be perfectly efficient for a one-man band but far too broad an approach for the paperwork at a bustling corporation. </p> <p>One of the biggest barriers to healthy records management is that so many employees have a hand in shaping it. There may be a central filing point but personal filing systems can spring up like mushrooms, as the desktops of most PCs will reveal. This can be avoided, however, with the appointment of a system manager, responsible for creating new files as well as tracking down old ones. </p> <p>Atle Skekkland, managing director of Aiim, the Enterprise Content Management Association, explains succinctly the need for a well-constructed system. \"If you put garbage in, you'll only get garbage out,\" he says. \"We are expanding our use of emails, using larger servers and filling them with information. But that doesn't make it any easier to find the information we need. It just makes the garbage come out faster. So set up a system that works no matter what, and then simply get the technology to support that.\" </p> <p>For anyone who has yet to get to grips with the mountain of paperwork in the corner of their office this sounds like a mammoth task. And as tempting as it may be, hiring a skip and dumping the lot in the car park isn't a way out. The destruction of records should be undertaken as carefully as their maintenance was. Once the legal threshold for holding a document has passed it should only be destroyed after consultation with the relevant department or manager. It should also be done in compliance with company policy. </p> <p>However, even documents that are several years out of date can cause a business enormous embarrassment if they fall into the wrong hands. This is particularly so for commercially sensitive information as well as personnel files containing personal employee details. At the most basic level, sensitive documents should be shredded, while increasing numbers of companies also send them to be recycled after that. </p> <p>So, still not convinced that your next job should be cracking the whip over your filing cabinet? Then perhaps Maureen Baker, a PA at Woolworths Group Plc in London, can persuade you. \"Good records management is a routine part of my role,\" says Baker. \"Apart from achieving efficiency and speed, I also get lots of praise from my boss. The knack is to not be afraid to tackle the task. Look at the information you have and ask your boss about what they need to become more efficient and in control of their business activities. I can promise that the results will be amazing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's triple medallist in Athens Bradley Wiggins has set himself the target of becoming the first cyclist to take gold in the individual pursuit in three successive Olympics. </p> <p>\"I'm looking for three pursuit titles on the trot, I will defend the title in Beijing, then I'll aim for London in 2012 if they get the games,\" said the Londoner, who took individual pursuit gold, silver in the team pursuit and bronze in the madison in Greece. </p> <p>Wiggins will devote 2005 to road racing, although as yet he is uncertain about his goals. \"The prologue time-trial of the Tour de France is the most natural thing to look at, but it may not happen next year, perhaps the year after or in 2007 if London gets the start.\" </p> <p>Together with Britain's other two-wheeled medallists from Athens, Wiggins topped the bill on Saturday evening at the Revolution 5 track meeting at the Manchester Velodrome, which gave home fans a rare chance to celebrate British cycling's most successful Olympics. </p> <p>To a background of Kraftwerk's Tour de France and a backdrop of Olympic action on a giant television screen, Wiggins was presented to a sell-out crowd together with the kilometre gold medallist Chris Hoy and the team pursuit silver medallists Rob Hayles, Chris Newton, Paul Manning and Bryan Steel, who has now retired. </p> <p>The husband and wife team of Ellen and Paul Hunter, who medalled with Ian Sharpe and Aileen McGlynn in the Paralympics, were also applauded by the 3,500-strong crowd. Only the team pursuit silver medallist Steve Cummings was absent, on national team duty in Australia. </p> <p>Resplendent in a specially made white jersey featuring the Olympic rings - which was auctioned later in aid of a local hospital - Wiggins set the tone for the evening by winning the opening event, a \"devil take the hindmost\", where the last rider across the line each lap is eliminated. Symbolically, he was led out by Hayles, with whom he took a bronze medal in the Madison relay. </p> <p>The variety of events included a four-man individual pursuit won by Newton from Wiggins and an individual sprint series, which culminated with Hoy taking on Craig Maclean in the final, where the duo delighted the crowd with a stand-still lasting 45sec before Hoy won from behind. </p> <p>\"I can't believe it was 10 years ago that I first came here, to the opening meeting, a fresh-faced junior riding the team sprint for Scotland,\" said Hoy. \"It's weird looking back 10 years, we didn't really have much to shout about back then apart from Chris Boardman, and it's been totally transformed since then.\" </p> <p>Hoy will ride the sprint events in the Grenoble Six-day next week, and will be looking for a strong ride in the track world cup at Manchester from January 7-9. </p> <p>\"It's nice to see an event progress and this has moved forwards since last year, they've invested in a sound system and lighting and so on,\" said British cycling's perfor mance director Dave Brailsford, who is talking to three potential major sponsors on the back of his cyclists' performances in Athens. </p> <p>\"What gives me the greatest pleasure is to see the young riders,\" said Brailsford, referring to the \"Future Champions\" events featuring under-19s. \"It's great for them to have something to aim for, and for them to rub shoulders with the Olympic champions. </p> <p>\"It's also great to have something where you can turn your head and see the great and the good of British cycling like Chris Boardman standing next to someone like Wiggins or Hoy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Max Mosley, the president of the FIA, has supported the suggestion that Silverstone could host a non-championship formula one race if it cannot agree terms with Bernie Ecclestone for a world championship grand prix next year. </p> <p>\"They could run a non-championship event for formula one cars,\" he said, \"and I think most of the British teams would go and, for a modest amount, they would probably get the continental teams such as Ferrari. They could run two, or even three, days of formula one practice which would effectively be free test days for the teams and then they would have the race on the Sunday. </p> <p>\"If they asked for that we wouldn't refuse it because they've got the rights to do it. It could also be called the British grand prix because that title is owned by the RAC MSA [Royal Automobile Club Motor Sports Association, the governing body in Great Britain] if they gave permission. The teams could run three cars if they wanted to. I'm just a distinterested observer watching this all going on, but they could certainly stage such a race.\" </p> <p>Mosley was speaking prior to the Brazilian grand prix where Ferrari were at the centre of controversy after failing to sign up for a raft of proposed cost-cutting changes which could be introduced for 2005 if the decision was unanimous. </p> <p>The teams agreed that if a limit on tyre testing was reduced to 10 days away from the races during the course of the season and a standard \"control\" tyre adopted by all the teams, sufficient savings could be implemented to trigger the teams' agreement to an 18th and 19th race on the 2005 schedule, thereby allowing the French and British grands prix to be run at a commercially realistic rate for their promoters. However, Ferrari blocked the changes because they felt they should be part of a much wider programme of cost reduction which also takes into account a more equitable distribution of the formula one commercial rights income with Ecclestone. </p> <p>Nevertheless it was significant that Peter Sauber, whose team uses Ferrari engines, chose to support the new proposal. \"I personally have a very good relationship with Jean Todt [the Ferrari sporting director],\" said Sauber. \"Therefore you can imagine how difficult it was for me to sign the cost savings initiative which was launched yesterday. [But] it is important for me to clarify that my signature by no means indicates any form of action against Ferrari.\"</p>",
  "<p>Why the female half of the British population persistently resists the temptation to get knackered and sweaty playing sport is a topic that resurfaces with tiresome regularity. There cannot be a woman out there who is not bored of hearing yet another statistic that declares she is contributing to the expanding girth of her generation through her slothfulness. And to what end? To date no scheme to buck the trend appears to have worked. Perhaps, though, they have simply been pressing the wrong buttons. </p> <p>That, at least, is the view of experts and opinion leaders working with the Women's Sports Foundation. A major initiative being launched by the WSF at the House of Commons next week aims to switch the focus from investigating not the physical but the psychological barriers that prevent many girls and women from raising themselves off their sofas more often. </p> <p>The SPA (Sport and Physical Activity) campaign differs from previous attempts to tackle this problem in seeking to influence not the circumference of a woman's hips or her reading on the scales but her attitude. </p> <p>Olympic successes and other high-profile achievements by sportswomen in the past 12 months have had little effect on the amount of female involvement in sport, which seems stuck at an all- time low. Countless reports illustrate this rejection of physical activity. </p> <p>Forty per cent of girls drop out of it by the time they are 18, never to resume similar levels of exercise throughout their adulthood; one third of six- to eight-year-olds do less than an hour of PE a week at school; and a survey by Sport England reveals that girls as young as seven are being put off sport for good. </p> <p>What is remarkable, considering the amount of groundwork and funding that went into producing such alarming findings, is that few have thought to ask women why they are bolstering these inactivity figures and, crucially, what might be done to change their thinking. </p> <p>Those that have produced an insight into what deters girls from playing sport - a Mori report commissioned by Sport England found that \"getting their hair wet\" or \"having to shower afterwards\" was enough to put young women off physical activity - have clearly failed to implement effective strategies to overturn these negative opinions. </p> <p>But it is on the psyche of sport-phobic females that the SPA programme hopes to impact most deeply. Already some aspects of the comprehensive campaign are being rolled out in communities around the United Kingdom. A focus group has been set up in Tower Hamlets, where young mothers of children under three, who are of mixed ethnicity and mainly from lower socio-economic groups, are being asked for their views about why they abstain from sport. </p> <p>Elsewhere Dr David Carless, of the University of Bristol's department of health and exercise science, is working with the WSF to uncover what prevents women over 60 living in rural Cornwall from being more physically active. A third investigation will centre on the attitudes towards sport of 14- to 18- year-old girls living in urban Manchester. </p> <p>What the researchers expect to find is that women everywhere, regardless of age and background, are increasingly resistant to the blame culture that attempts to prompt them into exercising more by making them feel guilty about not doing enough. All too often negative messages - about weight, about health and about body image - are used to raise public awareness of the positive benefits of physical activity. Yet in many cases that serves only to compound a woman's self-criticism. </p> <p>And perhaps, thinks the WSF, that is where it has all been going wrong. Instead, from the qualitative findings obtained from their focus groups, the WSF plans to implement clearly defined strategies that address the unique factors identified by women as deterrents to sport. </p> <p>They do not expect an overnight solution nor for it to be simple to employ. Yet it is ironic that, after years of paper-shuffling and high-powered government initiatives, ordinary women from all walks of life could be the ones to come up with the answers we have been waiting to hear.</p>",
  "<p>Northampton put some ordinary domestic form behind them to win their first European outing in a rain-lashed Glasgow yesterday. They scored the only try of the match within two minutes of the start and the Scots will wonder how they were caught cold on the biggest day of the season so far. </p> <p>Northampton's coach Alan Solomans admitted the importance of the early score. \"That was the key for us,\" he said. \"We said before the match that it was important in the first 10 or 15 minutes to get points on the board before the pitch cut up too badly. </p> <p>\"I felt that we had the edge up front and that won us the game. In my experience with Ulster I've found that you need to win all your home matches in the Heineken Cup and two away from home,\" he said. </p> <p>This was supposed to be the pinnacle of club rugby but dire conditions meant the match was an advert only for long studs. Heavy overnight rain made running rugby impossible. Time and again players with a stack of international caps let the ball slip out of their grasp and passing was a high-risk enterprise. </p> <p>Saints' early score came when Chris Budgen, a late replacement for the Scotland prop Tom Smith, rolled out of two tackles in the midfield and fed the centre Marc Stcherbina who had no trouble drawing the full-back Rory Kerr and sending Ben Cohen under the posts. </p> <p>Shane Drahm kicked the conversion but that was all Northampton could manage in the first 40 minutes. One penalty did hit the posts and fell kindly for Darren Fox but the move was spoiled, as most of them were, when Corne Krige let slip the bar of soap. </p> <p>Fox soon found himself in the sin-bin for foul play but Saints were also to have a one-man advantage after the break when his opposite number Donnie Macfadyen saw yellow for a professional foul. </p> <p>Glasgow responded with two first-half penalties from Parks to turn round trailing just 7-6. But with the home side having to play up Hughenden's slope in the second half the Northampton forwards tightened their grip and slowly squeezed the life out of the home forwards. </p> <p>The Saints started to maul the smaller Glasgow pack while taking control of the set scrums, earning at least one turnover there. With Saints pitching camp in the Glasgow half Drahm was able to extend their narrow lead with two more second-half penalties. </p> <p>Twice a mistake by the full-back Kerr almost gave Northampton a second try. First he knocked on and the Saints wing John Rudd was winning the race to Cohen's hack ahead, only for the referee to ignore the advantage laws. As the match wound down an attempted clearance by Kerr was charged down by the substitute Wylie Human; the full-back was promptly replaced. </p> <p>A Parks penalty with seven minutes left at least set up a tense finale but Northampton were equal to the last-gasp rally and held on to claim their first win in six outings. </p> <p> <strong> Glasgow:</strong> Kerr (Howarth, 70); Lamont, Morrison, Henderson, Logan; Parks, Pinder (Beveridge, 75); Tkachuk, Bulloch, Harrison (Kelly, 70), Hall (Wilson, 75), Turner, Mather, Macfadyen, Petrie. </p> <p><strong> Pens:</strong> Parks 3. </p> <p><strong> Northampton:</strong> Reihana; Rudd (Human, 50), Stcherbina, Hyndman, Cohen; Drahm, Robinson; Budgen (Sturgess, 80), Richmond, Kempson, Lord, Browne, Fox, Krige, Blowers (Seely, 76). </p> <p><strong> Try:</strong> Cohen. <strong> Con:</strong> Drahm. <strong> Pens:</strong> Drahm 2. </p> <p><strong> Sin-bin:</strong> Fox, Macfadyen. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> E Darriere (Fra). </p> <p><strong> Attendance:</strong> 2,772.</p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Thomas was sent off on Saturday night as the <strong> Neath-Swansea Ospreys</strong>, lost to <strong> Castres</strong> 38-17 at Stade Pierre Antoine in the Heineken Cup Pool four. </p> <p>The Wales forward was dismissed for punching Mauricio Reggiardo in the 83rd minute. The Ospreys were overrun by four Castres tries. The French side built a 20-0 lead in 27 minutes and forced the visitors into retreat with their driving maul. The fly-half Yann Delaigue controlled the game scoring three conversions, two penalties and a drop-goal. </p> <p>Shane Byrne's early try gave <strong> Leinster</strong> a good start away to the Italian side <strong> Treviso </strong> in Pool two, but they did not make the result certain until the second half when further scores from the Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll and his international team-mate Shane Horgan helped them to a 25-9 win. </p> <p>Leinster were frustrated by a brave Treviso defence but regained control when the lock Malcolm O'Kelly returned after a spell in the sin-bin. Treviso's points all came from Marius Goosen. </p> <p>In the European Challenge Cup <strong> Saracens</strong> beat <strong> Bayonne</strong> 24-21, Robbie Kydd scoring 16 points, including a try, after the London side had fallen 14 points behind in the first half. </p> <p><strong> Sale</strong> won 31-22 away against <strong> Catania</strong>, beating the Sicilian minnows with tries from Chris Mayor, Chris Rhys-Jones and Mark Cueto. </p> <p><strong> London Irish</strong> overcame <strong> Auch</strong> and left south-west France with an impressive 20-18 win.

  "<p>The final scramble for places on next season's European circuit saw Richard Sterne rescue his tour card in brilliant fashion yesterday by winning the Madrid Open with a closing 65. </p> <p>With the Australian Wade Ormsby shooting 66 to claim a share of sixth place and save his place on the circuit as well, his compatriot Jarrod Moseley and England's Simon Wakefield paid dear for missing the cut. They will have to go to next month's qualifying school to win back their cards. </p> <p>Incredibly, Moseley finished less than \u00a310 behind Robert Karlsson in the order of merit. But by surviving the cut at Club de Campo, the Swede pushed Moseley into the drop zone, despite the Australian earning more than \u00a3100,000 this year. </p> <p>The South African Sterne arrived in the Spanish capital 122nd in the order of merit, needing to climb six spots to ensure his tour spot. Now, after finishing two strokes ahead of Anders Hansen, he has earned himself a two-year exemption. </p> <p>Seve Ballesteros, the tournament host, described Sterne's performance as \"unbelievable, outstanding\". The 23-year-old's 31 on the front nine, including an eagle and three birdies, was the joint best of the day. </p> <p>Sterne started the day one of four players one stroke off the lead, jointly held by his compatriot Darren Fichardt and the Englishman Paul Broadhurst, but took over the lead on his own when Fichardt double-bogeyed the 385-yard 8th. It was a lead Sterne never let go, adding a birdie on the long 14th and closing with four pars for an 18-under total of 266 and a winner's cheque of \u00a3115,225 - \u00a324,000 more than he earned in the rest of the season. </p> <p>Ormsby began the week 125th on the money list and was equally thrilled after his 66. Needing to par the last to avoid going back to school, he sank a 10-foot putt for birdie. </p> <p>Whereas Moseley and Wakefield learnt their fate away from the event, there were more hard-luck stories at the course. Johan Edfors and Ivo Giner had to finish first or second to keep their cards and were both in position to do it, but they dropped to ninth and sixth respectively. </p> <p>Edfors was leading with a hole to play in his third round when he suffered a lost ball off the tee. Only after he had gone back to the tee and double-bogeyed the hole did a spectator come forward to say she had seen the ball being lifted. \"I would have paid a lot for that ball,\" said the Swede. </p> <p>The former Dunhill Cup winner Jamie Spence, chairman of the players' committee, finished joint 30th and lost his card by three shots. </p> <p>Wakefield, meanwhile, will remember the last hole of The Heritage tournament a month ago. Lying fourth, he hooked out of bounds and a bogey six cost him \u00a317,000. Eventually, it also cost him his card.</p>"
