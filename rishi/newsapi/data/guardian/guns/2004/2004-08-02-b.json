  "<p>Ashley Giles was the bowler who gave batsmen sleepless nights - but only in his dreams. Now the man taunted by shouts of \"rubbish\" and \"bring on the wheelie bin\" is England's garlanded hero, having overtaken Steve Harmison as England's most successful bowler this summer, with 27 wickets. </p> <p>The rise and rise of Giles - or the King of Spain, as he is known because of the misprint on his benefit mug - is astonishing. He has taken 24 wickets in his last three Tests, with nine apiece at Lord's and Edgbaston. </p> <p>At the start of the season his average was fat and pushing 40. Now it is down to a slimmer 36.45, better than the match-winning Phil Tufnell and the parsimonious John Emburey. His match figures of nine for 112 at Edgbaston were the best of his career. And they were achieved before what he describes as \"the best crowd in the country. </p> <p>\"It's where I feel most comfortable. I get the chance to change in the same corner of the dressing room as I do when I play for Warwickshire. From the moment I arrive Roy French and Ron King, our dressing-room attendants, spoil me. They've got a mug of coffee ready from the moment I walk in, they are always running around after me and that sort of attention helps you feel at home.\" </p> <p>His success has not surprised Troy Cooley, the National Academy's fast bowling coach, who is based at Loughborough and whose job is to develop young talent. </p> <p>But he also goes on England tours and appears for the start of home Test matches. Increasingly his fingerprints can be seen on a number of improving fast bowlers, such as Harmison, Matthew Hoggard and Andrew Flintoff. </p> <p>\"I like to think I can help all bowlers, fast or slow,\" he said from Loughborough yesterday, where he was overseeing a spin camp for up-and-coming off-spinners, helped by the former Australian Test player Ashley Mallett. \"But Ash [Giles] must take most of the credit for his own development. He has his own check list. </p> <p>\"Technically, since Bangladesh last winter, he has given himself better access to the crease to take his weight forward. He didn't get much of a bowl in the West Indies. But he did a lot of net bowling and we are seeing the benefit of that now. </p> <p>\"He's now got a good repeatable action. He's a tall man with good control and plenty of bounce. When you add the spin you have a good bowler who can bowl over or round the wicket. But what's happened to him recently is not really a technical thing. It's more to do with confidence. He's enjoying his bowling, he's in a groove and he has a smile on his face.\" </p> <p>Any bowler taking the wickets that Giles has this season will be bowling with a spring in his step. But the new-found confidence from Giles is also due to a fundamental technical change to his action and it was masterminded by the Lancashire coach Mike Watkinson, who worked with England in Bangladesh last winter. </p> <p>Watkinson, himself a former off-spinner, said last night: \"I was involved in the initial changes and I was going over the notes with John Inverarity, the Warwickshire coach, recently. We straightened his run-up, so that he was no longer running in at a sharp angle between the umpire and the stumps, with his energy going in the direction of point. </p> <p>\"This means he is bowling at off-stump from mid-crease, instead of spearing it into middle stump from wide of the crease. His fingers are also coming over the top of the ball, instead of cutting under it. </p> <p>\"At first he found himself slow through the air and his pace had always been good. But now the pace is right and he can adjust it according to the pitch. I'm delighted for him because even his broad shoulders can sag with all the criticism he's had.\"</p>",
  "<p>Paul Gregg's bid to seize control of Everton suffered a significant setback last night when Lord Grantchester, the Labour peer who it was claimed would provide major financial backing to a proposed \u00a315m rescue package, denied any involvement in the scheme. </p> <p>Gregg had even earmarked Grantchester, a former director and a grandson of Everton's former benefactor Sir John Moores, as a potential chairman once the current incumbent, Bill Kenwright, had been ousted. The 53-year-old Cheshire farmer's decision to distance himself from the claims has merely added to the sense of turmoil.</p> <p>\"I am a lifelong Evertonian and share a deep disappointment and frustration at seeing our great club failing to compete at the highest level,\" said Grantchester, a critic of Kenwright since being forced off the board four years ago.</p> <p>\"I understand the desire for change. With that in mind I have had preliminary discussions to see how the present difficulties could be put in the context of a long-term solution for stability. But it is not the case that I am behind Mr Gregg's proposals to underwrite funds for the club and, indeed, I have not seen his proposals to the board.\"</p> <p>The peer's non-involvement casts further doubt over the viability of Gregg's plan. The director says he has raised \u00a315m to invest but that his backers will apparently come forward only if Kenwright resigns. The chairman, who is backed by the third and final director Jon Woods, has refused to do so as Gregg has offered no proof as to where the funds will come from.</p> <p>The split has left Everton in a state of limbo. \"Any solution needs to underpin the future of the club,\" Grantchester added. \"A short-term measure, while providing temporary respite, must not be burdensome. The present circumstances cannot be helpful to David Moyes as he prepares for the start of the season.\"</p> <p>Wayne Rooney's future will not be decided until the struggle has been resolved. The squad returned from a tournament in Texas yesterday and the manager will take a threadbare side to Sheffield Wednesday tonight.</p> <p>\"I don't think there'll be any new faces coming in before the start of the season,\" Moyes said. \"We had two outfield subs [in Sunday's 3-1 defeat] and we can't go on like this, it's ridiculous.</p> <p>\"We're as stretched as any football team I've ever known. This is too big a club for it to be handled in the way it has been. We have to pull together. I will make sure I do my bit with the players. I just hope everybody else can do the same.\"</p>",
  "Premiership footballer Lee Hughes, 28, was accused at Coventry crown court yesterday of fleeing the scene of a fatal car accident to dodge a breath test. <p>Mr Hughes denies causing death by dangerous driving in his \u00a3100,000 sports car. </p> <p>It is alleged he lost control of the Mercedes CL55 coup\u00e9 near his home in Coventry, ploughing into an oncoming Renault, killing Douglas Graham and severely injuring his wife, Maureen, and the driver, Albert Frisby. </p> <p>Opening the case for the prosecution, Melbourne Inman QC, said Mr Hughes ran from the crash scene early last November 23. </p> <p>He went to a police station 36 hours later to say his brakes had locked and he lost control. </p> <p>He had previously pleaded guilty to failing to stop after an accident and failing to report an accident. </p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "Almost alone in the democratic world, we British have no written constitution protecting our basic civil and political rights. We have no charter defining the scope of the powers of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. Where parliament remains passive, the government, clothed in ancient monarchical authority, exercises unbridled prerogative powers - to wage war, to make binding treaties, to control the civil service and to issue or withhold passports. <p>Post Hutton and Butler, provided that ministers act in \"good faith\", ministerial responsibility for gross errors of judgment is written in water - except at election time. </p> <p>There was another example of the abuse of prerogative powers when the government announced its decision not to allow British citizens to take complaints of breaches of the UN covenant on civil and political rights to the UN human rights committee. We are alone in the European Union in this respect. What the government dislikes about giving us the right of petition is that it would bring into play the covenant's guarantee of equality without discrimination - a guarantee that is enshrined in the written constitutions of the other European states. The government is judge in its own cause, and we citizens can do nothing about this denial of a basic constitutional right except to campaign for better government. </p> <p>Ever since the American and French revolutions, British political leaders have rejected the idea of entrenching fundamental rights in a supreme constitution. For 40 years British governments have exported written constitutions to new democracies across the former empire while opposing any proposal to place themselves under similar constraints at home. </p> <p> The two principles of the unwritten Victorian constitution under which we are governed are parliamentary supremacy and the rule of law. But parliamentary supremacy usually means executive domination. As for the role of the independent judiciary, it is essential in ensuring that governments do not act lawlessly or use their powers to excess, but the courts are subordinate to an executive-dominated parliament: lions under the throne, and even their independence can be undermined by political interference. </p> <p>For British governments, power is delightful, and absolute power is absolutely delightful. Parliament may pass a human rights act, but a future parliament could repeal or emasculate it. In 1968, parliament enacted emergency legislation to deprive 200,000 British Asian passport holders fleeing from racial persecution in East Africa of their right to enter and live in their country of citizenship. The statute was racially motivated, but there was no remedy in our courts because parliament can use its law-making powers as it (or the government) pleases. Recently, the government came close to persuading a supine parliament to pass a law depriving vulnerable asylum-seekers of access to judicial review to challenge abuses of Home Office powers. It was only the threat of defeat in the Lords that induced them to abandon this measure.</p> <p>The systemic failings of the British system will not be cured by exhorting parliamentarians to meet the challenge of the democratic deficit, or even by creating a better voting system for parliament. We need more fundamental reform: a written constitution that defines the nature and limits of the powers of each arm of the state, and provides legal protection against the misuse of legislative as well as executive power. Instead of relying upon the European convention on human rights, we would enjoy the protection of a British bill of rights, designed to meet British needs. </p> <p>A British constitution would identify the core values of our liberal democracy within the wider European context. Armed with a British constitution, our negotiators in Brussels would have stronger bargaining powers in their dealings with EU institutions.</p> <p>Those core constitutional values would provide a better basis for the civic education of each new generation of British citizens than David Blunkett's clumsy attempts to induce a sense of \"Britishness\" and loyalty to the state among Britain's alienated ethnic and religious minorities. </p> <p>A written constitution would replace the present mass of verbose and indigestible devolution legislation. The single statute regulating the mayor of London and the GLA is far longer than any written constitution for an entire nation. The new legislation for regional assemblies in England and Wales will add further incoherence to the existing mess. </p> <p>A written constitution would confer discretionary powers on the executive and leave leeway for a dynamic interpretation by a modern, fairly chosen judiciary. </p> <p>The time is over-ripe for Britain to join the rest of the democratic world by placing government under the supreme law of a constitution approved by the British people as a whole. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Lord Lester QC is a Liberal Democrat peer and practises at Blackstone's Chambers. <br> Email: <a href=\"mailto:lestera@parliament.uk\">lestera@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "If we have learned anything over the past 18 months it is this: that the first rule of politics - power must never be trusted - still applies. The government will neither regulate itself nor be regulated by the institutions which surround it. Parliament chose to believe a string of obvious lies. The media repeated them, the civil service let them pass, the judiciary endorsed them. The answer to the age-old political question - who guards the guards? - remains unchanged. Only the people will hold the government to account. <p>They have two means of doing so. The first is to throw it out of office at the next election. This works only when we are permitted to choose an alternative set of policies. But in almost every nation, a new contract has now been struck between the main political parties: they have chosen to agree on almost all significant areas of policy. This leaves the people disenfranchised: they can vote out the monkeys but not the organ-grinder. So voting is now a less important democratic instrument than the second means: the ability to register our discontent during a government's term in office. </p> <p>Applying the first rule of politics, we should expect those in power to seek to prevent the public from holding them to account. Whenever they can get away with it, they will restrict the right to protest. They got away with it last week. </p> <p>The demonstrators who have halted the construction of the new animal testing labs in Oxford command little public sympathy. Their arguments are often woolly and poorly presented. Among them is a small number of dangerous and deeply unpleasant characters who appear to respect the rights of every mammal except Homo sapiens. This unpopularity is a gift to the state. For fear of being seen to sympathise with dangerous nutters, hardly anyone dares to speak out against the repressive laws with which the government intends to restrain them. </p> <p>It is not as if the state is without the means of handling violent extremists. Murder, arson, assault, threatening behaviour and intimidation are already illegal in the United Kingdom. Instead, it has seized the opportunity provided by the violent activists to criminalise peaceful dissent. </p> <p>The Home Office proposes \"to make it an offence to protest outside homes in such a way that causes harassment, alarm or distress to residents\". This sounds reasonable enough, until you realise that the police can define \"harassment, alarm or distress\" however they wish. All protest in residential areas, in other words, could now be treated as a criminal offence. </p> <p>The new measures, if they are passed, will also ensure that most protesters can be charged with stalking: they need only to appear outside a premises once to be prosecuted under the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act. The government will also seek to \"suggest remedies\" for websites which \"include material deemed to cause concern or needless anxiety to others\". As my own site has already been blacklisted by at least one public body, I have reason to fear this proposal, alongside every online dissident in Britain. </p> <p>If all this goes ahead, in other words, legal protest will be confined to writing letters to your MP. Or perhaps even that could be deemed to cause \"concern or needless anxiety\" to the honourable member. </p> <p>When Caroline Flint, the Home Office minister, introduced these proposals to a grateful nation on Friday, she promised that \"we are not talking about denying people the right to protest\". We have every reason to disbelieve her. The same promise was made with the introduction of the 1986 Public Order Act, the 1992 Trade Union Act and the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, and immediately broken. When the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act was passed, the government swore that it would not be used against demonstrators: it was intended solely to protect people from stalkers. The first three people to be prosecuted under the act were all peaceful protesters. The government also assured us that it would not misuse the antisocial behaviour orders it introduced in 1998 to deal with nuisance neighbours. They, too, were immediately deployed against peaceful demonstrators. It is hard to think of a better tool for state repression: once an order has been served on a protester, he is banned from protesting until it lapses. The police now use it to neutralise the most effective activists. The government liked this new power so much that in 2003 it wrote it into law, with an Anti-Social Behaviour Act designed to restrict peaceful protest. </p> <p>When some of us complained that the Terrorism Act 2000 was so loosely drafted that it could be deployed against almost anyone seeking political change, the government told us we were being hysterical. Since then, peaceful protesters all over Britain have been arrested as potential terrorists. At the Fairford air base, for example, the police used the act to terrorise the peace campaigners protesting against the Iraq war. The protesters were repeatedly stopped and searched: often one team of police would let someone go after a full body search, and another one would immediately seize her and repeat the whole procedure (this happened to one protester 11 times in one day). On March 22 last year, the police seized three coaches carrying people to a peaceful demonstration at Fairford, held them for two hours, confiscated their possessions, then sealed off the entire motorway network between Gloucestershire and London, and escorted them back to the capital. The police and the home secretary knew full well that these people were not terrorists. They also knew that the law allowed them to be treated as if they were. </p> <p>It doesn't end here. The civil contingencies bill, which permits the government to suspend parliament and ban all rights to assembly whenever it decides that it is confronting an emergency, passed its second reading in the Lords last month. It could become law later this year. </p> <p>A similar clampdown is taking place all over the world. The US Patriot Act, passed by Congress before any representative had read it, allows the state to treat dissenting citizens as if they were members of al-Qaida. For the past three years, the European Union has been seeking to reclassify the protesters who travel to European gatherings as terrorists. This is the contract the powerful have struck with each other: to agree to a single set of neoliberal policies, and to criminalise all those who seek to challenge them. </p> <p>We are often told that the passage of laws like this is dangerous because one day it might facilitate the seizure of power by an undemocratic government. But that is to miss the point. Their passage is the seizure of power. Protest is inseparable from democracy: every time it is restricted, the state becomes less democratic. Democracies such as ours will come to an end not with the stamping of boots and the hoisting of flags, but through the slow accretion of a thousand dusty codicils. </p> <p>By the time we have lost our freedoms, we will have forgotten what they were. The silence with which the new laws were greeted last week suggests that the forgetting has already begun. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "It was just after 9am yesterday that Scotland's Holyrood parliament building finally became a place of work. <p>Three years after they were supposed to take up residence, a small vanguard of around 170 office workers carried boxes of belongings into the finished portions of the building, even as construction staff laboured to complete the rest. The flitting from the parliament's temporary home on the Mound will continue in the coming weeks, with MSPs due to take up residence at the end of the month. </p> <p>It was only early yesterday that the site at the foot of Edinburgh's Royal Mile got its formal safety certificates to allow the first staff to move in. Building control inspectors are said to have worked through the night to ensure there was not yet another embarrassing delay. Officials say that more than 90% of the building is ready to be occupied. </p> <p>Yesterday was the first time anybody had been allowed on the site without a hard hat. Security staff were among the first to move in, along with IT staff, personnel who will organise public and school visits, and the chief executive, Paul Grice. </p> <p>The parliament's presiding officer, George Reid, who will move into his office tomorrow, said that it was a turning point for the project. </p> <p>\"This is Scotland's biggest flitting,\" he said. \"As I have said before, once we are in, we can then get on. The staff through the doors today are settling in well and enjoying the surroundings of their new workplace. With migration firmly under way, we can now prepare for the start of business.\" </p> <p>Earlier, Mr Reid acknowledged the massive problems which dogged the parliament building. The results of an inquiry into the handling of the project, set up by the first minister, Jack McConnell, and headed by Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, are due in weeks. The building's cost, originally priced at \u00a340m and supposed to open in 2001, now stands at \u00a3431m. \"This has been a major failure in public procurement in Scotland,\" Mr Reid told BBC Radio Scotland. </p> <p>\"We have Lord Fraser who will decide responsibility and report at the end of the month, but then we should get back to what we are good at. We are not good at building. MSPs are not experts on that, but [rather at] building a better government, a more compassionate and a more enterprising Scotland - and that is the challenge that faces us in the new chamber.\" </p> <p>In June, Scotland's spending watchdog concluded that the parliament could have cost \u00a3160m less if the project had not been so badly handled. Robert Black, the auditor general, said there had been a lack of a proper budget or controls, and an unrealistic timetable, and the wrong type of contract. The project, he said, had been effectively leaderless and flawed from the start. It is thought that Lord Fraser's report will be even more damning. </p> <p>Views on the structure's architectural merit vary widely. One critic described it as a \"Mir space station on steroids\". Others say that the building, originally designed by the late Catalan architect Enric Miralles, who died in 2000, is a landmark structure of international importance. </p> <p>The public will get a chance to assess how their money has been spent in the autumn. The 129 MSPs will start moving into their offices on August 30, in time for the start of the parliamentary session on September 7. The building will be officially opened by the Queen on October 9.</p>",
  "<p>The battle for control of British Energy, the stricken nuclear operator, intensified yesterday when bondholders accused Polygon, the hedge fund trying to secure a better deal for shareholders, of signing up to the original financial rescue package. </p> <p>Ahead of what is expected to be a stormy annual meeting on Thursday, bondholders alleged that Polygon, which now holds 5.6% of BE, was among the 88% of creditors that signed the \u00a35bn government-backed restructuring deal in October 2003. </p> <p>They claimed that the fund, as an original signatory, had a contractual duty to back the deal along with other creditors and its current efforts to unravel it raised questions about its integrity. </p> <p>\"A company which signs up to something in one capacity, making money, and then walks away and does something completely different in another capacity prompts you to call into question what it is up to,\" well-placed market sources said. </p> <p>But Polygon insisted it was acting in the wider interests of shareholders, including 230,000 retail investors, who stand to emerge with just 2.5% of the restructured nuclear operator if the European commission approves the rescue package this autumn. </p> <p>\"This is a complete red herring,\" a spokesman said. \"We have been completely upfront and don't have any bonds.\" </p> <p>He refused to comment, however, on whether Polygon had held bonds in BE \"over the last couple of years\". </p> <p>Bondholders stand to emerge with at least 34% of BE under the complex restructuring deal which may or may not breach EU rules on state aid. </p> <p>The government, which initially gave BE a \u00a3650m credit facility to prevent its collapse into administration two years ago, will get 65% of cash flow if Brussels approves the deal, and can convert this into equity. </p> <p>Polygon, which only recently converted its 5.6% \"economic control\" into full stock, is backed by Invesco Perpetual, an investment fund owning 6%, in pushing for an alternative plan. </p> <p>That proposal would see 30% of a restructured BE given back to shareholders while bondholders would be bought out with \u00a3750m in cash. The company, government and bondholders reject this option, saying the current deal is the only way of saving the group. </p> <p>Sources close to Polygon insist that shareholders are being \"fleeced\" because BE's financial position has improved with the near-doubling of wholesale power prices in the past year. </p> <p>Conceding that BE was \"on its knees\" when the October 2003 deal was signed, they said: \"But there was no mechanism in the restructuring which would allow people to change their minds when the facts change ... Investors are getting no share of the upside in a company worth \u00a31bn on the implied value given by its bonds.\" </p> <p>The nuclear operator insisted, however, that shareholders stood to get 2.5% and 5% on warrants - much better than in comparable restructuring packages such as Marconi's. </p> <p>\"There won't be any renegotiation and I can't see the government putting up any more money,\" an insider said, reaffirming the company stance that investors will get nothing if the deal falls. </p> <p>The board says it will delist the shares if shareholders vote down the restructuring at an extraordinary meeting in late autumn. Polygon says new listing rules will preclude this but BE insists it will get a waiver. </p> <p>The group, which on Friday cut its planned output for this year because of reactor problems, is said to be generating cash and has repaid all government loans, but says its future is \"far from rosy\".</p>",

  "For the four anxious-looking women taking a cigarette break yesterday morning on the corner of 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue, there was only one topic of conversation. <p>Unlike former terror threats, the warnings from the department of homeland security on Sunday were remarkably specific and the Citigroup building they were in front of was one of five potential targets named in the financial sector. </p> <p>One of the women, of Asian origin, said she had been stared at on the subway on the way into the office. Another had made sure she was wearing trainers, in case she needed to run. \"If I've got to go, I'm out.\" The women, who asked not to be named, were especially concerned that they worked on one of the 59-storey building's top floors. </p> <p>\"It's scary,\" said one. \"I've never felt this unsafe. People are saying we should go about our normal lives, but how can we? I am worried that I am so high up. They ran through fire drills and reminded us of the exits, but it's hard to be here. The cops with the guns are great, but if a car comes flying across the street, what are they going to do?\" </p> <p>Mercedes Castiel, a doctor with a practice on 53rd Street, was on her way into the Citigroup building. \"I am surprised there haven't been suicide bombers here,\" she said. \"They've used those tactics everywhere else. Hopefully it won't happen, but the most important thing we can do is stay calm and carry on with our lives.\" </p> <p>The design of the building - which belongs to the biggest banking group in the world - sitting on a narrow central column and then on cement columns that act as stilts, has also raised concerns that it could be vulnerable to attack. The usual entrance was closed yesterday, as was a public atrium, and workers were forced to wait in line while their bags were checked. Police cars prevented vehicles from parking outside the building and officers with machine guns patrolled the perimeter. </p> <p>It was a similar picture at another target, the New York Stock Exchange in lower Manhattan, draped in a huge US flag. Black iron barricades and gun-toting police surrounded the building, although in the case of the exchange both are now a familiar sight. </p> <p>The most obvious sign of a new threat level was the media presence. Workers weaving through the security sounded a mixture of defiance, nervousness and resignation. </p> <p>Jacob Ross, a clerk on the trading floor, said the warning had \"absolutely\" made him nervous. </p> <p>\"There are a lot of guys on the floor who are saying if something happens, they are out of here, even if something happens down the street. We are at breaking point for a lot of people.\" </p> <p>Jay Purushotham, a paralegal in the arbitration department at the exchange, said: \"You are always coming in knowing that the exchange is a target.

I am a little worried, but there is nothing I can do about it.\" </p> <p>He said it had crossed his mind that political motives could be behind the terror alerts, but it was \"hard to believe it's completely for political reasons\". He said the government was \"in a damned if they do, damned if they don't situation\". </p> <p>Sharona Robinson, a compliance examiner, was more phlegmatic: \"We are pretty safe down here ... it's business as usual.

  "It was while retreating this night up the silent, snowy slopes that I came upon a perfectly preserved dead waxwork German squad. By this time the whole front was silent. There was no rifle or machine-gun firing, no artillery, no mortars, not even clanking tank treads or truck motors to be heard in the distance. <p>The spectacle that caused my mouth to open in wonder, and almost in admiration, consisted of five German soldiers spread out prone in a semicircular skirmish line. They were still staring forward, alert for signs of the \"Amis\" [Americans]. Behind them, in the center of the semicircle, was an equally rigid German medic with his Red Cross armband, who had been crawling forward to do his work. In his left hand, a roll of two-inch bandage; in his right, a pair of surgical scissors. I could infer a plausible narrative. One or more men in the group had been wounded, and as the medic crawled forward to do his duty, his intention was rudely frustrated by an unspeakably loud sharp crack overhead, and instantly the lights went out for all of them. The episode was doubtless a tribute to our proximity artillery fuse, an invaluable invention which arrived on the line that winter, enabling a shell to explode not when it struck something but when it came near to striking something. Here, it must have gone off five or 10 yards above its victims. </p> <p>For a minute I stood and contemplated this weird tableau. It was a sight that somehow brought art and life into strange relation. If an artist had arranged these figures this way, with the compelling narrative element, an audience could hardly have refrained from praise. It was so cold that the bodies didn't smell, and they'd not begun visibly to decompose, but their open eyes were clouded, and snow had lodged in their ears and the openings in their clothes and the slits in their caps. Their flesh was whitish green. </p> <p>Although they were prone, their knees and elbows were bent, as if they were athletes terribly surprised while sprinting. They looked like plaster simulacra excavated from some chill white Herculaneum. </p> <p>No one but me, apparently, saw this sight in the moonlight. Had I hallucinated the whole thing? Or was it some kind of show put on for my benefit? Was I intended somehow to interpret it as an image of the whole war and its meaning, less a struggle between good and evil than a worldwide disaster implicating everyone alike, scarcely distinguishing its victims in the general shambles and ruin? Whatever it meant, this experience remained with me as a prime illustration of modernism, not that it occurred but that it seemed so normal, and that no one seemed to care.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Excerpted by permission from Doing Battle: The Making of a Sceptic, by Paul Fussell.</p>",
  "The reason I couldn't go along with the majority on the Commons home affairs committee regarding identity cards is that I remain unpersuaded of the need for such compulsory identification (MPs attack Blunkett ID card plan, July 29). <p>As the amendment to the report states, if it can be convincingly shown that identity cards would act as a deterrent to terrorism, that would be sufficient for their introduction. But, as the home secretary has accepted, the proposed scheme would not have prevented the atrocities that occurred in Turkey and Spain, and both of those countries have identity cards. </p> <p>The information commissioner spoke of his increasing alarm when giving evidence to the committee over the proposed national identity register, which he thought represented a very significant sea change in the relationship between the state and every individual. </p> <p>The Home Office's current estimate for the scheme is between \u00a31.3bn and \u00a33.1bn and the latter figure amounts to the whole NHS capital project for 2003-04. One can be pretty certain, as on previous Home Office projects, that the eventual cost will be considerably higher. </p> <p>Some see identity cards as almost a panacea for many dangers and problems that undoubtedly exist; these problems are similar to those faced in other EU countries which have had such cards for a long time.<br><b>David Winnick MP</b><br>Lab, Walsall North </p> <p>What I find particularly disgraceful is the fact that David Blunkett continues to assert that \"over 80% in all focus group and opinion polls\" support his proposals - as if this provided adequate justification for passing legislation. </p> <p>He must be ignoring the recent Privacy International (YouGov) and Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust \"state of the nation\" polls that indicate levels of support as low as 61% nationally and just 56% regionally, in Scotland. </p> <p>Opposition to the proposals is deep, entrenched and growing rapidly as details of the scheme emerge. The Home Office, meanwhile, refuses to engage in proper debate, and rolls on with its increasingly unbelievable plans. If Labour truly thinks that ID cards have the support of the nation, it should put them in its manifesto and let the country decide before taking a step further.<br><b>Phil Booth</b><br>National board director, NO2ID </p> <p>So David Blunkett is extremely pleased to tell us that more than 80% agree with his ID card plan. Presumably most people judged that it would be convenient to carry a single ID card, rather than several. Unfortunately, selling the project via the ID card cleverly masks what it is really all about, and that is the allocation of a \"universal personal identifier\" to every citizen. These are unique identifiers which eventually would enable a future government to create detailed computerised dossiers on everyone at the push of a button and in complete secrecy.<br><b>Dr John Welford</b><br>Edinburgh </p> <p>Stephen Brown is incorrect in his statement that France has abolished the requirement for EU citizens to hold a French ID (Letters, July 30). It is the carte de s\u00e9jour (residency permit) that is no longer required but can be requested. All French citizens carry an identity card. EU citizens can reside in France on the back of their national identity document - ID cards or, for UK citizens, a passport. My wife and I have a carte de s\u00e9jour but on more than one occasion we have also been asked for our national identity papers, ie passport. Therefore a national ID would be much more practical.<br><b>David Prout</b><br>Valreas, France</p>",

  "<p>Warnings of a specific and detailed bomb threat from al-Qaida terrorists prompted increased security measures today around five prominent financial institutions in New York, Washington DC and New Jersey. </p> <p>The US secretary for homeland security, Tom Ridge, had warned that intelligence sources had uncovered a plot involving car or truck bombs directed at the Citigroup Centre building in New York and the New York Stock Exchange, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank buildings in Washington and Prudential Financial's headquarters in Newark, New Jersey. </p> <p>As Americans today read details of the plan to attack the country's economic heartland, their president, George Bush, said the warning came as \"a solemn reminder of the threat we continue to face\". </p> <p>Mr Ridge said the intelligence did not offer an idea of the timing of any possible attack, but a cache of recently obtained information, including photos, drawings and written documents, indicated that al-Qaida operatives had undertaken meticulous preparations to case the five buildings. </p> <p>\"The quality of this intelligence - based on multiple reporting streams, in multiple locations - is rarely seen, and it is alarming in both the amount and specificity of the information,\" Mr Ridge said at a hastily arranged news conference yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Ridge refused to reveal the sources of the intelligence, but acknowledged the warning was a result of international cooperation and specifically thanked Pakistan. </p> <p>The Pakistani information minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, said today his country's agents had discovered plans to attack the US and UK on a computer seized during the arrest of a suspected senior al-Qaida operative. Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian arrested on July 25 after a 12-hour gun battle in the eastern city of Gujrat, was wanted in connection with the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. </p> <p>A senior US intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the intelligence gathered from several sources indicated that terrorists had carefully observed security in and around the buildings. They had identified the best places for reconnaissance, worked out how to make contact with employees who work in the buildings, researched traffic patterns and noted the locations of hospitals and police departments. </p> <p>The official said he had not seen such extraordinary detail in his 24 years in intelligence work. He cited as an example a midweek pedestrian traffic count.</p> <p>Mr Ridge raised the terror threat level for financial institutions in Washington and Newark to orange, or high alert, the second highest level on the government's five-point spectrum. New York was already at orange. Elsewhere, he said, the alert would remain at yellow, or elevated. </p> <p>Following the US warnings, the British Home Office said it continued to monitor the \"real and serious\" threat from terrorism, but did not warn of any specific risk. </p> <p>\"We do not discuss the threat level. If a specific threat arose we would inform the public,\" a Home Office spokesman said. </p> <p>Mr Ridge acknowledged that in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks the government had changed the threat level \"about a half a dozen times\". He said that he knew generalised warnings alarmed the public and imposed a public cost in extra security, but that the specific nature of these plans made it possible to raise the threat level only for the financial institutions.</p> <p>Some in the US have criticised the government for seeking political advantage with vague terror threats. The latest warning came just days after the end of the Democratic national convention, which gave George Bush's rival in the presidential race, John Kerry, a particularly high profile in news reports. </p> <p>However, the New York Times reported that many Democrats appeared to take yesterday's threat seriously. </p> <p>Briefing reporters in New York, police commissioner Raymond Kelly said that, starting today, trucks would be banned from the Manhattan-bound side of the Williamsburg Bridge, which connects Brooklyn and lower Manhattan. Among other measures, commercial vehicles were banned from using the Holland tunnel to travel into the city from New Jersey. </p> <p>In Newark, police set up metal fences surrounding the Prudential Plaza building, blocked off two city streets and patrolled the area with assault rifles. </p> <p>Washington's mayor, Anthony Williams, put the entire city on an orange alert, although the homeland security department has not officially raised the threat level outside financial sector buildings. The city's police chief, Charles Ramsey, said teams of bomb-sniffing dogs would sweep areas around the World Bank and IMF headquarters and officers would conduct more traffic stops of large vehicles in the area. </p> <p>Officials have warned that the al-Qaida network may launch a large-scale assault in the hope of disrupting the November 2 presidential election and demonstrating that it remains capable of offensive actions despite international efforts to combat terrorism. </p> <p>The stock exchange and the Washington institutions were to open for business today, as was Prudential, with employees expected to report to work. Officials in New York, New Jersey and Washington encouraged people to continue their normal activities but remain vigilant.</p> <p>Mr Bush announced today that he would implement many of the intelligence reforms recommended by a national inquiry into the September 11 attacks. He said he would create the post of national intelligence director and a dedicated counter terrorism centre called for in the September 11 commission's report.</p>",
  "<p>The gap between rich and poor has continued to grow since Labour came to power, a report by a Blairite thinktank revealed today.</p> <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) accused the government of failing to argue consistently and publicly for a fairer, more equal Britain. </p> <p>The rich have continued to get richer since 1997, the IPPR says in its report, State of the Nation, which is published today. </p> <p>The richest 1% of the population have increased their share of national income from around 6% in 1980 to 13% in 1999. The wealthiest 10% of the population now own more than half the country's wealth - up from 47% to 54% over the past 10 years.</p> <p>But despite the government's declared aim to eradicate child poverty, 23% of children in Britain were living in households earning below 60% of median income in 2001, compared to just 5% in Denmark, 10% in Sweden and 14% in Germany.</p> <p>The poorest continue to be more likely to suffer from crime. Around 4.8% of people earning less than \u00a35,000 a year were burgled last year, compared with 2.7% of those earning over \u00a330,000. </p> <p>Parental social class and ethnicity still heavily influence life chances, the thinktank found, while women continue to be more likely to live in poverty than men.</p> <p>The widening gap between rich and poor can be seen in the fate of boys born to rich and poor fathers. Sons born in 1958 to fathers from the richest fifth of the population earned on average 13% more than those born into the poorest fifth of the population. </p> <p>But the sons born to wealthy fathers in 1970 earned 37% more then their poorer contemporaries. People from a professional family background remain more than twice as likely to end up professionals than someone from a manual working class background, the IPPR found.</p> <p>The IPPR report is the first part of the thinktank's work on rethinking social justice. The projects aim to show how Britain has changed since 1994, when the IPPR set up a commission on social justice at the request of the late Labour party leader, John Smith. IPPR director Nick Pearce said: \"Despite the boldness of its pledge to eradicate child poverty and the expansion of investment in public services, the government does not consistently articulate and publicly advocate a fairer, more equal Britain. </p> <p>\"It has often achieved social justice objectives by stealth. It should now try to do the same for fairness and equality as it has done for public services and shift the terms of political debate.\"</p> <p>He called on the government to \"lead public debate more firmly in a progressive direction\" and to explain, justify and secure support for social justice\". </p> <p>Economic secretary to the Treasury, John Healey, said: \"There has been a lot of good done, but there is more to do.\" </p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that government policies such as the New Deal, the national minimum wage and improved access to childcare were helping, but added: \"It is a long-term generational political challenge.\" </p> <p>\"One-and-a-half million children have been lifted out of poverty since 1997 through the combination of support that we've put in place,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>SVEN, ETC</strong></p> <p>The East has taken untold valuable things from the West - greed, disease, Chicken McNuggets - but the roles always get reversed eventually.

But the last word should go to another eccentric old soul - David Mellor, who knows a bit about sex scandals. \"If [Sven] had won Euro 2004,\" Mellor said, \"he could have slept with the guard dog and got away with it.\" It pains us to say it, but he's got a point, hasn't he?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>HUGHES DENIES DANGEROUS DRIVING CHARGE</strong></p> <p>West Brom striker Lee Hughes today denied causing death by dangerous driving at Coventry Crown Court, but did plead guilty to failing to stop after a road accident last November in which a father of four was killed.

Opening the case for the prosecution, Melbourne Inman QC said Hughes was travelling \"very fast\" on the wrong side of the road just before ploughing into a Renault Scenic in which Douglas Graham, 56, was killed.</p> <p>\"The prosecution say that the defendant's car was out of control, being driven too fast, and it smashed right into the front of the car Mr and Mrs Graham were in,\" the lawyer said. \"It was a very big impact. The collision was such that Mr Graham died almost instantly. The prosecution say it is clear that the Mercedes was obviously travelling very fast because it could not hold the bend.\"</p> <p>The court was told that Hughes and his long-standing friend, who were in the front of the Mercedes, then fled the scene. \"The defendant then hid for a day and a half until the following Monday - more than 36 hours later,\" Mr Inman added.

I would give a decade of my life to have had the book published 40 or 30 or 20 years ago when the useless fools of the left swallowed the nostrums of Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky just as today's useless fools of the rights swallow the reactionary rubbish of populist, xenophobic neo-liberals. It is a joy to read. But too long. But why is there no new Lytton Strachey? Give me 200 pages of compelling iconoclastic prose in which every sentence works in place of these tombstone books twice as long as the new EU constitution and rarely more readable. Is there a new novel by Robert Wilson? No English novelist has held me so tight as his political-sociological-historical thrillers set in wartime Lisbon or modern Seville. I would like to take Clinton's My Life with me but I just cannot read it. I have never heard such a compelling speaker with such political, populist, and policy intellectual depth. An hour at a seminar with Clinton and you see why he rewrote the book of progressive politics for his generation. But as so often, the great communicators cannot write and the great writers cannot communicate. Tim Garton Ash's new book on the joys of freedom lies waiting to be devoured. Right now, Britain is the cream of the cream in our current crop of intellectuals who produce important histories, global analyses, and prescriptive manuals. Garton Ash is one of the stars. An MP friend, James Purnell, has just sent me David Ceserani's book on the left and Jews. Jewish humanism is a vital component of 20th century socialism. The next great find will be for Islam to find terms of trade with secular social democracy.

  "<p>The Liberal Democrats today called on banks and other lenders to put a share of their profits towards helping those in financial trouble </p> <p>Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democratic party, said that Britain's collective debt of \u00a31,000bn, equivalent to \u00a316,500 for every person in the UK, including children, made access to good financial advice vital. </p> <p>Vince Cable, the party's Treasury spokesman, said that interest payments on this level of debt worked out at \u00a36bn every month. </p> <p>He urged the financial services industry to help fund financial advice for those in debt by contributing 0.01% of profits towards debt counselling. </p> <p>\"People who find themselves in debt need to be able to access independent financial advice as soon as they are in difficulty,\" he said. \"It is essential that good independent financial advice is available easily and locally. Being able to access financial advice before things spiral out of control can help people avoid the many traps that may lead to further debt. </p> <p>\"Today I am asking banks and other lenders to contribute as little as 0.01% of their profits to increase the capacity of financial and debt counselling services,\" Mr Kennedy said. </p> <p>If banks were to contribute 0.01% of profits each year, this would generate a donation of \u00a32.27m. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Consumers Association welcomed the call. \"The idea of a private/public partnership is something we have wanted for a long time.\" </p> <p>The Association proposed the implementation of a national financial advice network in 2002. Such a network would offer free advice to people in a variety of venues, such as Citizens Advice Bureaux, the workplace and high street banks. </p> <p>However, in response to Mr Kennedy's calls, a spokesman for the British Bankers Association (BBA) said that banks had already donated almost twice that amount to similar projects. \"Banks already work very closely with money advice services,\" said Brian Capon, a spokesman for the BBA. \"We contributed \u00a35m towards this last year.\" </p> <p>The shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, added: \"Debt advice - provided by organisations like the Citizens Advice Bureau - can be very valuable.\" </p> <p>\"But I don't see much point in calling on financial institutions to make a contribution which is half the size of that they are already making.\"</p> <p>Mr Letwin said that the \"debt commission\" that he has established under the chairmanship of Lord Griffiths would be reporting a few months from now on measures that can be taken to help people avoid debt spirals - particularly people with low incomes.</p>",

  "<p>Plastic surgeons today warned people not to have cosmetic surgery to try to gain celebrity looks.</p> <p>The advice from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) followed the publication of a survey which ranked the celebrities whose bodies are most admired by cosmetic surgery patients.</p> <p>The survey by the Harley Medical Group (HMG), which runs 10 cosmetic surgery clinics in the UK and Ireland, found that model Kelly Brook's bottom was the most admired body part among 250 of its patients - with 82% ranking it as their favourite celebrity behind.</p> <p>Other sought-after features included Sienna Miller's nose (38%), Scarlett Johansen's lips (71%), Kate Beckinsale's breasts (64%), Charlize Theron's hips (42%) and Keira Knightly's stomach (67%). </p> <p>Among male respondents to the survey, actor Jude Law got the most votes for lips (55%), while the most-admired nose belonged to presenter Jamie Theakston (36%). Troy star Brad Pitt was considered to have the best body shape, winning 74% of the votes, compared with David Beckham who only scored 8%. </p> <p>The HMG claim that with increasing numbers of people seeking to change their appearance cosmetically, many visit their surgeon with a particular celebrity's features in mind.</p> <p>But Norman Waterhouse, president of the BAAPS, said that it was not advisable for people to undergo cosmetic surgery in pursuit of movie star looks. </p> <p>Mr Waterhouse said: \"One of the things surgeons must evaluate when interviewing patients is whether they have realistic expectations about the potential results. Wanting to look exactly like a celebrity is a classic example of unrealistic attitudes.\"</p> <p>He added that most plastic surgery was geared toward enhancing a person's appearance while preserving their individuality. BAAPS advise patients seeking cosmetic surgery to speak to a qualified plastic surgeon when deciding what procedure is best for them.</p> <p>Louise Braham, director of the Harley Medical Group, said that it was \"incredibly important\" that expectations were correctly established between the surgeon and patient before surgery. </p> <p>She said: \"The patient must feel sure that the surgeon understands precisely the effect that they are looking for, while the surgeon will want to be sure that the patient has 100% accurate and realistic expectations of the results of the surgery and what to expect during the post-operative recovery.\" </p> <p>The most popular cosmetic procedures for women are breast enlargement, liposuction and nose jobs, while men mostly opt for liposuction and penis extensions. </p> <p>Ms Braham said: \"We would never say, 'Yes - we can give you Sienna's nose or Scarlett's lips'. Apart from anything else, what looks great on one person may be out of proportion or out of sync on another.\" </p> <p>Dr Kerri McPherson, a body image expert at Queen Margaret University College in Edinburgh, said that some people felt pressured over what their bodies should look like by what they saw on TV and in magazines. </p> <p>\"Magazines and the media tell women how they should look, and they tell them they should have pert breasts, a well-proportioned face and thin waist,\" she said. </p> <p>But Dr McPherson said that celebrities should not be blamed for making women want to look like them, as they often faced the same pressures. </p> <p>\"The fact that they can afford to change the way they look also adds more pressure on to other women who have not got the same income,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>While Colin Gibson may have enjoyed a long and largely successful career as a sports journalist, his move into PR looks unlikely to be anywhere near as fruitful.</p> <p>Gibson was working at Associated Newspapers last November when Mark Palios came calling. The new FA chief executive had lost faith in communications director Paul Barber after the handling of the Rio Ferdinand drugs test affair and a debacle over the selection for England of Alan Smith - who had been arrested for throwing a bottle into the crowd at Leeds United's Elland Road ground.</p> <p>The FA was confident that Gibson's \"long career in sports journalism at the highest level, as well as his managerial experience, makes him an ideal choice to fulfil this demanding role\". But just eight months after taking on the job, Gibson looks set to follow Mr Palios out of the door at Soho Square.</p> <p>So what went wrong? Why did he contemplate entering such an untenable deal with the News of the World - offering to sell Sven-Goran Eriksson down the river if the paper turned a blind eye to Mr Palios' own alleged affair with the Faria Alam?</p> <p>\"He was shafted by the News of the World. He was a very, very good reporter himself and the leader of the pack before he became an executive, always the one to organise the stories. But if you sup with the devil you can have your hands cut off,\" said one journalist who knows him.</p> <p>Another said: \"He never struck me as a natural PR man; he was always someone who loved the cut and thrust of being a journalist. He is a charming man and it will be hard to find someone who has a bad word to say about him, but he was probably naive about the world of news.\"</p> <p>One journalist who Gibson spoke to during the last week said the former Daily Mail man was horrified by \"press intrusion\", and was genuinely surprised by what news journalists on tabloid papers would have considered \"routine\" - including door-stepping and extensive background checks on the private lives of everyone involved in the story.</p> <p>Another ex-colleague explains: \"He was used to dealing with people who he knew within the world of sport and hadn't been exposed to the harder sort of news. The people he would have dealt with, there would have been a fair amount of trust there - whereas news is full of one-day heroes who don't want to be anybody's friends.</p> <p>\"The problem for any specialist reporter is you cannot afford to bite the hand that feeds you.\" </p> <p>That naive quality may well have led to his downfall. When he spoke to the News of the World about the Sven affair, they no doubt considered they were dealing with one of their own. </p> <p>As PR man Mark Borkowski said: \"Obviously Colin Gibson is an ex-journalist, this is where the problems stem from. He's a gamekeeper turned poacher - and journalists are less kind to them. They expect them to know what the rules of the game are.\"</p> <p>One sports writer told MediaGuardian.co.uk today: \"There is a tendency for sports organisations to appoint journalists to run their communications, but they don't have the skills that are needed. What they need is established PRs.\"</p> <p>Another writer pointed out that journalists do deals with PRs all the time, but that the trick is not to get caught. </p> <p>\"We all do deals and there is a certain amount of trust involved in that, but in this case Colin was probably naive to believe the News of the World would do the Sven story and leave Palios alone.\"</p> <p><strong>'He must be honest - he got it wrong'</strong></p> <p>It now appears inevitable that Gibson will join Mr Palios in taking the blame for the past fortnight's mess, whether or not the deal he offered the News of the World was his idea. </p> <p>Veteran publicist Max Clifford told Sky News: \"I personally doubt the call was made on his own volition. But he should have been old and wise enough to say: 'No way do we do this - or this is what will happen'. He must be honest - he got it wrong.\"</p> <p>Even friends and colleagues fear Gibson's time is up. Telegraph sports editor David Welch, who worked with him on the Sunday Telegraph, says: \"He was always thoroughly professional and full of enthusiasm for the job. He had a certain magnetism to which staff responded... Of course I feel sympathy for anyone from our profession who finds themselves in such a tricky situation.\"</p> <p>And Mick Dennis, a former sports editor of the London Evening Standard, says: \"Colin Gibson has been a friend for 20 years and I very much hope he will be a friend for the next 20 years. But he has blundered horribly in this. He cannot again share a platform at a press conference with Sven, so the end of the week will see one of them going.\" </p> <p>Gibson's pedigree as a journalist is unquestioned. He started out as a football reporter for the Daily Telegraph in Manchester, before moving to the Mail, back to the Daily Telegraph and then to its sister Sunday title, where he became football editor and then sports editor.</p> <p>His record led to him being poached by the Australian, which in 1999 made him its sports supremo ahead of the Sydney Olympics. The following year, after the games, he was lured back to the Daily Mail as sports editor after being offered a lucrative package to take over from retiring veteran Bryan Cooney.</p> <p><strong>FA: history of appointing media men</strong></p> <p>Gibson is widely thought to have done a good job at first. \"The sports writers had been known as Cooney's loonies,\" one former colleague recalls. \"But Colin calmed it all down. People started thinking again: 'If it's in the Daily Mail, then it's probably true'.\"</p> <p>But Gibson did himself no favours when his sports pages confidently predicted David Beckham would not move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. In September last year, he was moved upstairs to become associate editor of sport and Matt Tench - the former editor of Observer Sport Monthly - was brought in as his replacement.</p> <p>Two months later, the paper's coverage of the Rugby World Cup came under fire from Mail editor Paul Dacre, and Gibson accepted the offer of a \u00a3150,000 salary with the FA. </p> <p>He followed a long line of journalists appointed by English football's governing body: former heads of media relations Mike Parry and Steve Double both had newspaper backgrounds, while Paul Barber's predecessor, Paul Newman, had a background in television news and sports presenting. Barber was the exception, with an established career in PR, having previously worked in-house at Inchcape and Barclays.</p> <p>In some ways, Gibson seemed an unlikely choice for the FA. The Mail's chief sports writer Jeff Powell was, and remains, opposed to the appointment of Eriksson, while the paper branded England players \"traitors\" over their threat to strike over Ferdinand's exclusion from the national squad.</p> <p>Nonetheless, at least one broadsheet rival provided support for the former Mail man. Glenn Moore wrote in the Independent: \"The appointment of a newspaper man is long overdue. The written press set the agenda in English football, and Gibson's proactive nature and newspaper nous may steer the FA, Palios and Eriksson away from the more obvious pitfalls.\"</p> <p>Or not. An incident shortly before Euro 2004, with Gibson just settled into the new job, may have identified him as a soft touch to the tabloids. He threatened to withdraw access to players from papers using a paparazzi shot of David Beckham, but the FA failed to carry the threat through when the Sun published the picture the following day showing the England captain with his hands in his underpants.</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "The Home Office today dismissed as speculation reports that David Blunkett's department will be split in two after the next general election to create a \"ministry of justice\" and \"ministry of rights\". <p>The plan - the latest in a long line of schemes to devolve elements of the criminal justice system from responsibilities for immigration, freedom of information and elections - would see both the current Home Office and Department for Constitutional Affairs dissolved and their briefs divided between the two new ministries. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Home Office today said talk of a justice ministry had been \"around for years\" - but he did not dismiss the idea outright. </p> <p>The spokesman later added: \"As a matter of departmental restructuring, this would be a matter for No 10.\"</p> <p> Such a reorganisation would be in the gift of the prime minister, who is reported in today's Daily Telegraph to be considering the move in the wake of a successful third election triumph. </p> <p>Asked about the story this morning, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This is an old story - it is clearly August.\"</p> <p>Any Whitehall reshuffle is unlikely to come before the next general election at the earliest because Mr Blunkett's plans on crime, anti-social behaviour and ID cards are intended to be the central plank of the government's legislative plans in the run-up to voting. </p> <p>With a contest tentatively pencilled in for next May, the Home Office is widely believed to have an unprecedented six bills lined up for November's Queen's speech, which will set the legislative programme for the coming year. </p> <p>Though the parliamentary session would be interrupted by a general election, the home secretary - backed by Mr Blair - is thought to be planning to introduce bills setting up a national serious crime squad of 5,000 officers, piecemeal legislation bringing in ID cards, a bill to extend anti-social behaviour orders, a bill to lower the burden of proof in terrorism trials and a shakeup in sentencing tariffs. </p> <p>Electorally, Labour has been buoyed by its perceived success in tarring the Liberal Democrats as \"soft on crime\" in recent byelections after the party opposed the bill introducing the original anti-social behaviour orders. </p> <p>Playing the law and order card in the run-up to the election would help party strategists again trap the Tories and Lib Dems into being seen as either backing Labour or siding with criminals rather than victims. </p> <p>One Blair aide was quoted in the press last week, when details of the legislative plan leaked, as saying: \"We are going to ensure that law and order is debated in the Commons every day in the six months before the election.\" </p> <p>The Tories themselves plan a big crime initiative before the party conference season this autumn. </p> <p>There has always been a Whitehall turf battle between the criminal justice elements of the Home Office brief and the responsibilities currently being carried out by the Department of Consitutional Affairs. That department, headed by Lord Falconer and only created last summer, currently handles the courts system, tribunals, freedom of information, data protection and human rights. </p> <p>The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, is believed to have clashed frequently in recent times with the home secretary over the independence of the judiciary and the rights of asylum seekers under human rights legislation.</p>",
  "<p>Frontline services at Hull city council, one of Britain's worst performing local authorities, are still failing residents despite numerous damning reports and the intervention of government troubleshooters, the Audit Commission warned today.</p> <p>In report on an inspection into the city's housing repairs and maintenance service, which took place in March and April this year, the commission concluded that intervention at the council has yet to improve services.</p> <p>Two years ago the commission found that Hull's poorly performing housing department lay at the heart of the council's problems. It warned it was heading for bankruptcy because it had failed to tackle the surplus of homes in the area, and had spent tens of millions of pounds repairing properties that needed to be demolished.</p> <p>The latest report, published on Friday, but released today, found that Hull is still \"potentially investing money in schemes that require demolition or re-modelling\".</p> <p>For example, a week before the inspectors visited Hull they found a decision had been made to repair 55 homes on the 1960s-constructed Ings Estate, despite the doubts of some councillors about the sustainability of the area.</p> <p>A study in 1999 warned that demand was low for 70% of Hull's social housing. Colin Inglis, the current leader of the council, dismissed this figure as \"absurd\". But today's report found that the council had yet to properly analysis demand levels for its homes.</p> <p>It added that properties earmarked for demolition in June 2003 had still not been torn down, which it said \"illustrates the council's failure to plan and deliver against targets\". </p> <p>The commission also found that the Hull council had no strategy for meeting the government's target for improving all homes to a decent standard by 2010. It pointed out that currently 71% of the city's homes fail that standard. </p> <p>Overall the commission assessed Hull's repairs and maintenance service as \"poor\" with uncertain prospects for improvement.</p> <p>It conceded that its new call centre and tenants' inspection centre were good and that staff and managers were committed to change. </p> <p>But the report added that these pluses were offset by a number of significant weaknesses.</p> <p>Other weaknesses included: \u00b7 Almost 4,000 homes lack a valid gas safety check. \u00b7 The council's approach to diversity and equality fails to comply with the Commission for Racial Equality's code of practice for rented housing. \u00b7 The council continues to let properties that are dirty and in need of repair. \u00b7 Supplying misleading information about its performance.</p> <p>Launching the report Nick Atkin, head of housing in the commission's northern region, said: \"Many improvements have been made at the organisational level in recent months, some as a result of the intervention of the secretary of state's appointee team, but these have yet to filter down into the way the service is delivered.\"</p> <p>Steven Bayes, the council's portfolio holder for housing, accepted the reports recommendations and pointed out that some had already been implemented. He said: \"The report provides us with a firm base on which to rebuild our repairs service so it is focussed on the service we provide to our customers\"</p> <p>He added: \"There will be challenging issues to address.

  "<p>Doctors' leaders yesterday began monitoring the hours junior doctors work in hospitals as new limits enforced by European law were introduced. </p> <p>As many as one in six NHS trusts may be breaking the rules and others facing severe difficulties, a Guardian survey testing preparedness suggested last week, and the British Medical Association is targeting six unnamed trusts where it may intervene over lack of compliance. </p> <p>Trusts risk \u00a35,000 fines for failing to meet the conditions of a European directive which limits junior doctors' hours to 58 a week, the first stage in a phased fall to 48 by 2009. </p> <p>The Health and Safety Executive has indicated that it will wait for evidence of malpractice over a period before intervening, meaning the BMA could be the first to launch legal action through employment tribunals. </p> <p>The junior health minister Stephen Ladyman said yesterday that the \"overwhelming majority\" of trusts now fully complied with the demands of the directive, and others had reached agreement with junior doctors on interim arrangements - a \"fantastic achievement\" thanks to the hard work of staff. </p> <p>\"Only in a little handful of trusts, agreement remains to be reached and all efforts continue to be made to resolve this.\" </p> <p>The BMA has promised to support doctors with legal advice \"where appropriate\". Simon Eccles, chairman of the BMA junior doctors' committee, said: \"This is health and safety legislation. It is being introduced to protect patients as well as doctors and hospitals need to take it seriously.\" </p> <p>The BMA is also worried that arrangements introduced in hospitals to comply with the law have affected doctors' training. </p> <p>It says doctors are required to work long shifts of up to 13 hours, and where these are being used to staff hospitals at night, trainees are often denied the opportunity to do work which increases their knowledge. </p> <p>\"We shouldn't forget that junior doctors are in hospitals to learn as well as look after patients,\" Dr Eccles said. \"Safe hours must not mean unsafe training.\" </p> <p>Chris Atkinson, of the NHS Confederation, representing hospital trusts, told BBC Online yesterday: \"Most hospitals have managed to meet the requirements. Those that haven't may within the next few months. However, there may be issues that cannot be overcome, such as shortages of staff in a certain speciality. </p> <p>\"The Health and Safety Executive, which will oversee this, has said it will wait to see what the trust has tried to do. If it is making every effort, the HSE will take a more lenient view. </p> <p>\"Patients will benefit because doctors will be working fewer hours and will be less tired, so standards of care should be increased.\"</p>",

  "<p>British devolution is leading to \"fat government\" and spiralling costs, rather than improved public services, shadow Tory minister, Bernard Jenkin, warned today.</p> <p>Mr Jenkin gave a shopping list of the costs associated with running the Greater London Authority, and the devolved governments in Scotland and Wales, in a bid to dissuade voters from backing a regional assembly in the north-east this autumn.</p> <p>The north-east is the only one of the three original regions to have the go-ahead for a referendum to decide the issue.</p> <p>Both Yorkshire and Humberside and the north-west saw their referendums postponed last month by deputy prime minister John Prescott. </p> <p>Mr Prescott cited concerns aired privately by the Electoral Commission over using all postal voting in the two regions, following the regional all-postal trials held in the June election.</p> <p>However, sceptics believe the decision to defer the two referendums was also prompted by fears of a 'no' vote just months before a possible general election.</p> <p>Citing the cost to tax payers of the London Assembly's city hall (\u00a3120m), the new Welsh Assembly building (\u00a355m) and the Scottish Parliament building (\u00a3431m), Mr Jenkin said that administrative costs had also spiralled out of control, with almost \u00a3500m spent across the three devolved governments.</p> <p>He also cast doubts on claims of \"less Whitehall interference\" as a result of devolution, saying that the regional office had seen costs rise by 70% since the London assembly was established. Launching the dossier outside the London Assembly's city hall, Mr Jenkin, shadow secretary of state for the regions, said: \"John Prescott's plans for regional assemblies in England come with a very large price tag. They will not result in one extra nurse, teacher or police officer, but will force up council tax bills via a regional council tax and divert resources away from frontline services. \"The experience of the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the London Assembly shows how creating a new tier of regional bureaucrats will spend hundreds of millions of tax payers' money - England does not want more bloated administrations or palaces for politicians. Regional government would be the best example of fat government yet.\"</p>",

  "Returning to Hugh Gaitskell eight years after completing his biography gives me a chance to think about connections between past and present. Some reviewers criticised me for likening Tony Blair to Gaitskell; while I acknowledge that there are limits to what the present can tell us about the past and vice versa, I still think the dialogue between the two is central to the project of writing biography - and the last eight years have made the dialogue between Gaitskellite revisionism in the 1950s and the Blair-Brown modernisation project even more interesting. <p>The Blair-Brown project has highlighted important structural constraints on the Labour party in power when it is led from the right. These constraints would have been much the same for a Gaitskellite government and were very much in evidence in the opposition Gaitskell encountered to his own modernising project. </p> <p>After a significant period of Labour in power, one of the central questions of Labour party studies in the 1980s and much of the 1990s has been answered. The question was: how does Labour win? The answer: by becoming the Conservative party. </p> <p>The most crucial respect in which they do this is by placing the gaining and holding of power at the centre of their political project. In this respect, there are clear comparisons between Gaitskell and Gaitskellite revisionism and the Blair-Brown project. </p> <p>The present and the recent past suggest two ways to think about what a Gaitskell government might have been like. They must be thought about with all the caveats that counterfactual history demands. The two dimensions are public service delivery and the special relationship with the US. </p> <p>On public service delivery, Gaitskell was an early critic of nationalisation and famously imposed the first charges on the NHS. He would have faced the problem that plagued the Wilson government: making the mixed economy deliver. </p> <p>The current Labour government has hit the same structural problems. If the market is not to be the solution to the delivery problem, then what is? </p> <p>Gaitskell had a public sector workforce that retained a strong sense of the value of public service but he still faced the problem of motivating the service providers. By the time of his death, Gaitskell still lacked convincing answers to the question of how planning would deliver what people wanted. </p> <p>The second constraint concerns the relationship between a revisionist leader and the party. This would have come into focus for Gaitskell - as it has for Blair - over the special relationship. </p> <p>Philip Williams judged in his official biography that in 1962 Gaitskell had finally come to terms with the Labour party. Michael Foot, reviewing Williams, picked up the point and articulated the left's problem with Hugh: \"For the charge against Gaitskell throughout the years of controversy was not that he lacked honesty or a fine intellect or courage,\" he writes. \"The charge was that he lacked the imaginative sympathy to understand the Labour movement which he aspired to lead, and that he was constantly, almost congenitally, seeking to guide it into alien channels\". </p> <p>Foot catches something here: that the self-image of the Labour Party members was not reflected back at them by Gaitskell's realist Atlanticism. </p> <p>Anti-Americanism was already widespread in the 1950s; today it is almost universal on the left. Blair suffers the same problem when he articulates his support for the democracies' war against terror because it connects him to the US. This is not now, and was not in the 1950s, an affront to logic; it was, and is, an emotional response that demands compliance to an oddly Stalinist view of the world in which America is the evil villain. </p> <p>There was nothing Gaitskell could do in the 1950s and 1960s to shake people in the Labour party out of this hysterical, emotion-driven anti-Americanism, and there is nothing Blair can do today. In both cases it ensured their leadership would always be contested. Their failure to be mere demagogues pandering to the anti-Americanism of the crowd cost them both dearly.</p> <p>The other kind of biographical dialogue concerns Gaitskell as a man. He was an intriguing figure who expressed in the conflict between his public and private lives a central dilemma - some would say crisis - in masculinity. </p> <p>Eight years ago, some reviewers felt I overplayed the divide in Gaitskell's personality, but I now think even more strongly that he tried throughout his life to maintain the separation of the personal and the political, and that the gap between the dry, Wykehamist minister and the warm, passionate friend and lover was the central paradox of his life. </p> <p>Occasionally the barriers were breached and the intense feelings flooded into the political sphere with electrifying effect, but more often the two were kept strictly apart. </p> <p>I think this sense of self and conflict is very common among male politicians, that the search for love that drove Gaitskell in his private life is connected to the forcefulness that propelled him in public life, and that the number of what we might call integrated personalities in politics is actually very small. </p> <p>The surprising thing is not that Gaitskell should have been a divided self but that others around him, such as Nye Bevan, should have been so much more of a piece. To account for this conflict requires an understanding of the culture and class from which Gaitskell came. </p> <p>However, what is striking about contemporary politicians such as Gordon Brown and Robin Cook is the extent to which psychological conflict remains a part of the politicians' makeup. The politicians of today did not grow up in the social and emotional world of Edwardian Britain, yet they seem to echo the kind of tortured self that was reflected in aspects of Gaitskell's character and was the defining characteristic of some of his contemporaries, especially Eden and Macmillan. </p> <p>Gaitskell embodied a strand of British politics now extinct, but he was also an intriguing human being. He never stopped struggling with his upbringing, his class and, finally, the constraints of the public life he had chosen. Initially he rebelled against his background; later he rebelled against the constraints his political life had placed on his ability to have fun by making a point of having it. </p> <p>This seeking out of fun took the form of a love of food, alcohol, jazz and dancing. At times the intensity of his pleasure-seeking could draw criticism, and the closeness of his relationships with women prompted some to question his commitment to the working class, but more often people remarked on his capacity for friendship and on his extraordinarily warm private persona. </p> <p>Politically, each time it appeared he had found his level, he transcended it and confounded expectations. He slowly resolved a number of deep-rooted private conflicts and seemed to be on the threshold of fulfilling a life of intense hard work when he died. This is the story of the man who was, for many, the last great democratic socialist leader of the Labour party.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Brian Brivati is a Labour party historian and reader in history at Kingston University.

  "<p>After years of promising extra channels, the stations backing digital radio are hoping to reach their target of 1m sets by the end of the year through a feature never seen before on a radio - a record button. </p> <p>For the first time, owners of the two latest digital audio broadcast (DAB) sets can now press a record or pause button to freeze a show so they can answer the phone and then resume playback when they are finished. The facility also allows owners to set the radio to record a programme, just as easily as setting the video recorder to tape a soap. </p> <p>Only two models have the technology: the Gemini 1 - \u00a3199 from Roberts - and The Bug - \u00a3149, designed by Wayne Hemingway, for Pure. Many more models with the new facility will be launched by the autumn, prompting the expectation that within a few years radios with record buttons will be the norm. </p> <p>Even in the car, the latest tuners are beginning to offer motorists the opportunity to record a show while they go to a meeting or fill up with petrol, says Dave Woodnut, technical services manager at the car radio maker Blaupunkt. \"It's funny when you look back at the early days of radio. Father would sit down, mother would bring him his pipe and the family would listen to the radio. </p> <p>\"Life's just far too fast for that now, so the radio is having to evolve to keep up. People can see there's something coming up that they're interested in but know they won't be around for, so it's natural they would want to record the programme. </p> <p>\"The real beauty of the pause and record facility is you can press a button to jump back, with our set, 45 seconds so you can hear the news headlines again or play back a clue to a quiz several times.\" </p> <p>Where radio executives believe this new-found freedom to not miss a radio programme will have the most impact tends to depend on their own interest. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly Xfm is predicting that recording music will be the big new use of the technology, allowing DAB - whose owners are normally middle-aged - to reach a far younger audience. </p> <p>\"There's always the irony with music aimed at the younger end of the market that when you're playing it on a Friday or Saturday night, they're actually out listening to it in clubs,\" says Graham Hodge, the station's business development manager. \"So we think we'll be getting a significant chunk of young listeners setting their radio to record the shows they're missing. We're so confident that we've developed our own Xfm-branded DAB set, with Hutchison, which will be out in the autumn.\" </p> <p>Conversely at Roberts, which traditionally develops radios that appeal to an older audience, the CEO Lesley Burrage see the technology, which the company is calling \"pause plus\", mainly being used by an older age group that wants to answer the door but not miss the ending of The Archers. </p> <p>\"It's obviously a feature that has a lot of uses,\" he says. \"I think, though, young people have so much wall-to-wall music playing in the background all the time that it's going to mainly be used, at first, by people that are actually listening to something, like a radio play or piece of music on Radio 3, that don't want to miss anything when the door bell goes.\" </p> <p>This is where the Digital Radio Development Bureau (DRDB) believes the initial use will be focused because there is more at stake for somebody missing a crucial passage in a piece of classical music or an interesting part of a documentary. </p> <p>The DRDB's chief executive Ian Dickens says: \"We've been showing the technology to all age groups to get feedback and the really interesting thing is that while the older generation think it's amazing, younger people are so used to downloading music they look at recording as something they'd naturally expect.\" </p> <p>\"So its first use is probably going to be people making sure they don't miss part of a play, but that will all change next year when you get a programme guide on digital radio that will make recording entire shows as easy as storing a TV programme on a Sky Plus box or video recorder. </p> <p>\"By around this time next year DAB owners will be able to look at a far more informative screen on their set that will show them all the shows scheduled on every station. They will then be able to scroll through them and highlight anything they want the radio to record.\" </p> <p>Some experts are predicting that this further advance for radios with record buttons will start to turn the humble radio into a music downloading device. Rather than just allow listeners to hear and record broadcast songs, future models will enable them to download tracks or even programme their set to always store a favoured artist or genre of music. </p> <p>At Pure, the company behind The Bug and Evoke range of digital radios (the latter being the top-two selling radios in the country), the feeling is that tuners are set to become far more intuitive. </p> <p>\"A programme guide will definitely mean people will flick through the schedules, just as they do on TV, and highlight, say, John Peel and ask the radio to record the show once or perhaps every week,\" predicts Pure spokesman, David Harold. </p> <p>\"The really interesting thing, though, is that this technology will progress so the radio knows the next track to be broadcast. It means you could set your radio to record David Bowie songs whenever they come on, so when you next turn on the set there's a growing selection of your favourite tracks you can play back.\" </p> <p>It is this area that has excited radio executives at Chrysalis (owner of Heart, Galaxy and LBC). The chief executive, Phil Riley, believes digital radios are on the verge of becoming iPod-style devices that empower owners to download tracks. </p> <p>\"The majority of the song is being sent to the radio anyway, so it can just be recorded. The clever bit, we foresee, is that we would then send the purchaser the beginning and end of the song that would replace the broadcast segments that would probably have DJ chat on them. All digital radio stations have a data capacity to send a clear version of the song as well as the version that is broadcast.\" </p> <p>For this to happen, Riley admits, digital radios will need to have a mobile phone built in to them, as well as a hard disc to store multiple tracks. However, industry observers are agreed that it is now just a case of when a mobile phone or organiser is launched with a DAB receiver built-in, rather than if. </p> <p>\"It makes so much more sense to use DAB to broadcast a popular piece of data, such as a video of the winning goal in a football game, rather than to tie up mobile phone bandwidth sending it to each phone subscriber individually,\" says John Cundall, group leader of internet applications at Roke Manor. </p> <p>\"So we can easily see a mobile phone organiser with DAB built in to it being launched soon because there's such a good business case for it. That would then obviously open up the technology so you've got an organiser in your shirt top pocket that is also a digital radio as well as an iPod.\"</p>",
  "<p>Marooned in a lake, Bhajan Das is determined to protect his most prized possession: the tin roof of his mud and bamboo shack. </p> <p>The 22-year-old returned home with his mother yesterday to find his cow floating dead in tea-brown water and with the walls of his homestead blown away by two weeks of torrential monsoon rain. </p> <p>It is not the rain he fears now, but the prospect of thieves who raid empty houses in the aftermath of the flood. \"I have lost everything. I cannot use the house if the roof is stolen as well,\" says Mr Das. </p> <p>Despite the fact that his house was standing in six inches of water, returning home was still a better prospect than staying on dry land. \"My family is in a government shelter,\" he says. \"But we only get one and half kilos of rice for eight people. So what is the point of staying?\" </p> <p>These villagers are among half a million people affected in Sylhet state alone, on the border with India. Thanks to its peculiar geography, the wetlands, or hoars, are covered by six feet of water for six months every year. Homes are built on raised ground and usually the monsoon is welcome as it brings rich alluvial silt that fertilises paddy fields. </p> <p>Although the hoars are situated in one of the wettest places in the world, this year they became wetter. Flash floods have seen the water level rise four metres (12ft), engulfing homes, wiping out the rice crop and threatening to bring diarrhoea and dysentery as the floods recede. </p> <p>In the dozens of villages that dot the hoars, government officials say that more than 250,000 homes have been destroyed or made uninhabitable. \"It is the worst flood I can remember,\" says 83-year-old Barun Roy, a former MP for the nearby town of Sanumganj. \"We will face a crisis unless the government acts because all the crops were destroyed. Where will the people get seeds to plant from next year?\" </p> <p>Only accessible by boat, there are also fears that many people will be left stranded, unnoticed by relief efforts that are directed at the shelters found on dry land. </p> <p>Musamad Lima, 19, is typical of their plight. It takes 45 minutes in a speedboat from the edge of Shanir hoar to reach her wooden shack. \"The land around this house has just been washed away,\" she says. \"But I have decided to stay here with my sick father. I cannot leave but no one has come to help me.\" </p> <p>The local administration says it is trying its best to cope with the disaster. \"The first problem is food, as people have nothing to eat. For 500,000 people we need 200 tonnes of rice a day for six months. I can say that it would be difficult to sustain this level of consumption without outside help,\" says Mohammed Jafar Siddique, the deputy commissioner for Sanumganj district. </p> <p>The scarcity of food has seen prices of necessities such as rice, cooking oil, salt and kerosene shoot up - in some cases by 200%. Aid agencies also point out that there is an increasing danger of the spread of water-borne diseases. </p> <p>Even without the flood conditions, Sanumganj has only a third of the 160 doctors required for its population. \"The lack of medical help and the serious danger of famine-like conditions in Sanumganj means that we will have an emergency on our hands unless something is done,\" says Shashanka Saadi, who coordinates relief efforts for Action Aid in Bangladesh. </p> <p>The greatest challenge in Shanir hoar is how to get food and medicine to people stuck beyond the land swamped by flooding. Supplies cannot be airdropped be cause the waters would swallow them up. Aid agencies say boats are the only answer, but it will take cash and organisation to mobilise them. \"Only the army has that sort of resource but they have yet to be deployed,\" said Mr Saadi. </p> <p>It is becoming increasingly clear that the Bangladeshi government is grappling with a disaster whose size it initially failed to acknowledge until the homes, livestock and crops of millions of its people had been swept away. </p> <p>Until late last week, Bangladesh's ministers were repeating the message that there was \"adequate emergency relief\". This changed on Friday when an international appeal for help was launched by the prime minister, Khaleda Zia. </p> <p>Officially, 544 Bangladeshis have been killed, although the officials concede the real death toll is likely to be much higher. Disease, spread by foul water, will greatly increase the number of victims. There has been an alarming rise in the number of registered diarrhoea cases: nearly 47,000 have been afflicted since July 12. </p> <p>More than 30 million people have been made homeless or left marooned by the deluge, which covers two-thirds of the country. Half of the country's capital is under water, including its diplomatic district. The government estimates that $7bn (\u00a33.95bn) worth of damage has been done. The international community is reacting slowly. America has pledged $210m (\u00a3118m), and Britain has sent \u00a310m of aid. </p> <p>Stretching across a vast delta where three of the world's great rivers meet, Bangladesh is a flood-prone country. Not only does the country have its own monsoon rain to flush away through its river system, it also has to deal with neighbouring India's. </p> <p><strong>Swollen</strong></p> <p>This year the floodwater has come from the rivers that rise in the Himalayas, course through India, and then empty into Bangladesh. Torrential rains in Bihar, in northern India, have contributed to extensive flooding there, killing hundreds and leaving millions homeless. </p> <p>The water has swollen the Ganges as it rushes through the plains to Bangladesh. The water is also taking longer to empty into the Bay of Bengal because of unusually high tides. </p> <p>Every year there is concern about India's deforested hills and mountains and its flood-control programme, which Bangladeshis say silts up riverbeds on its side of the border. </p> <p>Standing on his wooden canoe full of empty nets, Jatinder Birma says there is no chance to catch the fish in Shanir hoar. \"Usually I catch enough fish to make 150 taka (\u00a31.50) a day. But for the last week I am only making 20 taka (20p). You see the fish need clean water to survive, not the mud that is now coming from India.\" </p> <p><strong>Casualties of the rains</strong></p> <p>Death toll from floods and monsoon rains across South Asia since June: </p> <p>Bangladesh: 544 <br> Nepal: 113 <br> Pakistan: 5 <br> India: 847<br></p> <p>comprising: </p> <p>Assam: 181 <br> Bihar: 601 <br> Kerala: 45 <br> Tripura: 3 <br> Uttar Pradesh: 17 <br></p> <p>Regional total: 1,509</p>",
  "<p>Two great milers will be besieged by autograph hunters at the Weltklasse athletics meeting in Zurich on Friday night as perhaps the most knowledgable crowd of all gathers to see the world's finest make their final competitive appearances before the Olympics. </p> <p>One, Hicham El Gerrouj, will hope to show he is on course to win the one great prize to have eluded him in his wonderful running career. The other will be sitting in the VIP seats, surely recalling some of his finest moments and perhaps wishing he could still be centre stage for Britain in Athens, battling for the 1500m gold against the great Moroccan. </p> <p>Sadly Sebastian Coe has not run competitively since 1989, but the good people of Zurich do not forget his achievements. It was in their city that Coe broke the 1500m world record in 1979, during that astonishing summer when he smashed three world records in the space of 41 days, and it was there he bettered the world mile record in 1981. With Athens fast approaching, we can be forgiven for recalling when Britain ruled the middle-distance world. </p> <p>Coe's name, inextricably linked with that of Steve Ovett, will forever be associated with the Olympics, especially Moscow in 1980, when Ovett upset the form book by defeating Coe to win the 800m and Coe, devastated by his loss, then winning what was regarded as Ovett's speciality event, the 1500m. As their rival, the American miler Steve Scott, put it in a recent book on the rivalry: \"It was not the Moscow Olympics, it was the Coe-Ovett Olympics.\" </p> <p>With the United States choosing to boycott the event for political reasons because of the Soviet Union's military action in Afghanistan, it may not be overstating the matter to suggest Coe and Ovett saved the entire Olympic movement through their unforgettable confrontations on the track. Athletics, then and now, is the focal point of the games and it is easy to imagine the extent to which they would have been devalued without these British stars. </p> <p>Would people have cared so much about the 1984 games in Los Angeles if they were not able to see the next instalment of the greatest rivalry in sport? Craig Masback, now the head of the United States Track and Field Federation, but then another decent runner who was unable to compete in Moscow because of the boycott, recalls: \"I think there were only two races shown on American television from the entire Moscow Olympics, and they were the 800m and the 1500m.\" </p> <p>Even though the US turned its back on the 1980 games, Coe and Ovett simply could not be ignored. For at least five years the mania these two great athletes generated gripped the country, everyone firmly either in the Coe camp or that of Ovett. Coe, the somewhat celebral and urbane charmer, trained by his father Peter with an intensity that seemed almost frightening to outside observers, was media friendly and beloved by the nation's mums. </p> <p>Ovett, from an altogether more working class background, was a natural athlete. He was exceptional from 400m all the way through to the half-marathon, and he was a Jack the Lad character, a street fighter of a racer who chose not to speak to the media for years. When he burst past opponents, waving to the crowd as he sprinted down the finishing straight, you either loved him or loathed him. </p> <p>It was only years later, when I got to know these two astonishing athletes, that I came to realise there were many similarities between the two men we had been led to believe were poles apart. Their training regimes had much in common. Both are proud; strong personalities with a wonderful sense of fun, and two who care profoundly about the sport that brought them fame and wealth. </p> <p>Oh, that they could still be running now. On Friday night, during an exceptional meeting at Crystal Palace, the historic Emsley Carr Mile went almost unnoticed. Not because it was a poor race but because no British athlete came close to figuring meaningfully in the action. Perhaps the improving Michael East, who missed the London event, can surpass expectations for Britain in Athens, but a more realistic assessment would be that El Gerrouj will be the man to beat after setting the fastest time in the world this year at a minor meeting in Belgium on Saturday night. </p> <p>One of the upsets of the Sydney Olympics four years ago came in the 1500m when El Gerrouj, perhaps overcome by the enormity of the expectations on his shoulders, was beaten by the unconsidered Kenyan Noah Ngeny. If Coe had not defeated Ovett in the 1500m final in Moscow to win the gold medal, he has since admitted he would have been tempted to quit the sport, and it is a measure of El Gerrouj as a man that he not only continued after his heart-breaking disappointment but established a dominance in the event and a run of victories that only came to an end in Paris at a meeting earlier this summer when, less than fully fit, he trailed in well down the field. </p> <p>El Gerrouj has explained his Sydney loss by saying: \"I was training like a crazy person. There was a lack of self-confidence and a lack of maturity. An athlete not only trains with his body, he trains with his mind.\" It is a rationale both Coe and Ovett would understand only too well and why, I am certain, both British greats will be hoping their Moroccan heir realises his Olympic dream. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Perfect Distance. Ovett &amp; Coe: The Record Breaking Rivalry by Pat Butcher. Orion Books \u00a314.99</p> <p><strong>Glamorgan right to stand firm on Jones</strong></p> <p>Cash-strapped Glamorgan have highlighted a potentially serious problem for English cricket after standing up to pressure from England's cricket selectors and deciding not to pick Simon Jones for their county championship match against Hampshire at Sophia Gardens. </p> <p>Not that I have anything against Jones, who is an exciting young cricketer, but it is patently nonsense that the England hierarchy should assume they have any sort of right to dictate which players should be selected by the counties. Jones, who has been struggling for full fitness and is short of match practice, was left out of the England XI for the second Test at Edgbaston but then also left out of the Glamorgan team. </p> <p>The Welsh county's coach John Derrick spoke of the \"dissension and unrest that might have been caused in the dressing-room\" if one of the county regulars had to make way for the centrally contracted Jones. Although Glamorgan rely on cash handouts from Lord's to make their books balance, and will have been made aware that they are not toeing the party line, they and the rest of the counties should fight tooth and nail to preserve the right to pick whoever they wish. If England have the right to stipulate which matches Test stars should avoid, it can only be correct that the counties should have the right to keep them sidelined if their replacements are doing a more than adequate job. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>As Haile Gebrselassie was wowing BBC TV viewers with a winning performance in his final race in Britain, the 5000m at Crystal Palace on Friday evening, that smooth master of ceremonies and sometime Sky athletics host Jon Ridgeon made his own telling contribution to the night's excitement. </p> <p>Spotting a moustached, long-haired Dave Bedford lookalike jumping out of the crowd and on to the track, the former hurdler rugby tackled the intruder before delivering what appeared to be a couple of telling blows and slinging the man back over the fence. </p> <p>A much-amused Bedford congratulated Ridgeon later. The London Marathon boss also revealed his legal battle to prove the directory enquiries line 118 118 had illegally used his likeness in a television advertisement had cost him upwards of \u00a360,000, even though he won his case. Perhaps he might consider sending Ridgeon round to settle his arguments in future.</p>",
  "Following the murder of gay activist Brian Williamson in Kingston in June, the Jamaica Observer published a letter which read, \"To be gay in Jamaica is to be dead.\" <p>Since Williamson's death, Jamaica's gay community has been even more fearful than usual. The motive was officially given as robbery, but Williamson was the only \"out\" gay activist in the country; members of the Jamaican Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-Flag), an organisation that operates underground and anonymously, believe that homophobia made him a target. According to their estimates, his was the 30th killing of a gay man on the island since 1997. </p> <p>International human rights organisations have described Jamaica as one of the most homophobic places in the world; gay and lesbian relationships are largely conducted in secret. But, while prejudice and violence against gay men have hit the headlines following Williamson's murder and the ongoing controversy over Jamaican singer Beenie Man's lyrics (which call for the execution of gay men), the plight of lesbians in Jamaica has not attracted the same attention. Yet their lives are no less difficult: in a strongly-worded statement issued in June, Amnesty International highlighted the growing problem of vigilante action against gays and lesbians, and of their ill treatment and torture at the hands of the police. </p> <p>According to the Amnesty statement, gay men and women have been \"beaten, cut, burned, raped and shot on account of their sexuality. Once a person's homosexuality becomes known to family and community they are frequently at risk.\" </p> <p>Even speaking out anonymously can place a gay woman at risk. According to a recent report from the London-based charity Asylum Aid, one woman who appeared on a television show to speak (from behind a screen) about the persecution she had endured because of her sexuality was verbally abused and assaulted. \"The following day, a co-worker who had recognised her voice went as far as beating her up,\" states the report. \"Other women suspected of being lesbians have been raped and chased out of their homes and communities.\" </p> <p>Paula Ettelbrick, executive director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission says: \"Brian [Williamson]'s murder has really pushed things back. Now there are no public voices in Jamaica to speak out against homophobia. Lesbians face constant sexual harassment.\" Common terms of abuse include \"batty man\" for gay men and \"sodomite\" for women. </p> <p>Technically, it is not illegal to be gay in Jamaica, although the Offences Against The Person Act bans any kind of physical intimacy between men. Section 76 of the act bans anal sex between men, and between men and woman - although the majority of prosecutions involve gay men, who can serve 10 years in jail with hard labour if convicted. No statistics are currently available on the number of prosecutions of gay men under this legislation, but J-Flag plans to start collecting figures held at local police stations. </p> <p>Because there is no mention of same-sex relationships between women on the statute books, they are perhaps more likely to be the objects of vigilante action. Amnesty has received numerous reports of lesbian women being raped: rapists believe theirs is an appropriate penalty for \"unnatural\" sexual acts, and that it will \"reprogramme\" a lesbian's sexuality. \"There are reports of lesbians being singled out for attacks on the grounds of a 'mannish' physical appearance or other visible manifestations of sexuality,\" reads the June statement. Lesbians have reported gang rapes in public places, witnessed and condoned by other men and heterosexual women. Those heterosexuals who believe that sexuality is a private matter, and not a reason to abuse or vilify others, are often too scared to express any public support. </p> <p>Nor does the situation seem likely to improve. \"Both the main political parties here have said they are not going to address homophobia,\" says a spokesman for J-Flag. \"I lived in London for many years and feel very comfortable with my sexuality but when I returned to Jamaica I had to go back into the closet. This society makes you feel self-loathing for your sexuality.\" </p> <p>Brenda, a professional woman living in Kingston, has resigned herself to keeping her sexuality a secret. Her relationships with other women involve clandestine meetings in out-of-the-way places. \"I'm always checking my back,\" she says. \"Some of my friends told me not to go near them again when I said I was a lesbian. And my parents asked me to leave their house. Beatings and rapes of gay women are the norm and are not considered to be a crime here. Many women don't report them to the police because they know the police won't do anything.\" </p> <p>She says that, in a recent case, two lesbian women walking together in a public park were dragged into a maze by six men and raped, although they had been demonstrating no physical affection towards one another. </p> <p>\"In Jamaica, a woman is stigmatised if she doesn't have children,\" says Brenda. \"Some of my lesbian friends have had children just to cover up the fact that they are gay. Brian Williamson's murder has been a war cry to the heterosexual community. Last week, a group of gay people leaving a party had their cars ambushed by people throwing rocks.\" </p> <p>Brenda believes that Jamaica's very masculine society has contributed to the level of homophobia. \"Men have it drummed into them from an early age that it's wrong to be affectionate,\" she says. In October 2003, a study carried out by the University of the West Indies in Kingston found that 80% of Jamaican men and 25% of women believed that the natural role of women was to support men. Their search also found that the majority of Jamaican men see themselves as more powerful than women, and believe that their authority over women is inherent and God-given. </p> <p>A spokesman at J-Flag said he believed that, at the same time, Jamaican men felt marginalised within a hyper-masculine society. \"In tertiary education, only 25% of the students are men; 75% are women. Many men are unable to get good jobs because they are less well-educated. When they are brought up, girls are subjected to more discipline than boys - which is one of the reasons they are more likely to go on to higher education. Boys are more likely to be allowed to run free. We have a real problem with male role models, too. A lot of children grow up in single-parent families with no father present. </p> <p>\"We hear arguments that God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. Homophobia is an irrational fear of gay people and people worry that if they allow gay people to 'take over' there will be no more procreation and the human race will die out.\" </p> <p>A number of gay Jamaicans have claimed asylum in countries where they can express their sexuality openly, such as Canada, the US and the UK. But, according to a recent report from Asylum Aid, Jamaican lesbians who claim asylum in the UK do not get a sympathetic reception. The report - entitled Safe For Whom? - states that Jamaica is one of more than 20 places on the British government's \"safe country list\": asylum applications from these countries are routinely dismissed by the Home Office. </p> <p>Sophia Ceneda of the Refugee Women's Resource Project at Asylum Aid is critical of the government's inclusion of Jamaica on its \"safe\" list. \"Recourse to protection is non-existent for Jamaican lesbians,\" she says. \"Deporting lesbians back to Jamaica puts their lives at risk.\" </p> <p>A Home Office letter sent to a lesbian asylum seeker from Jamaica acknowledges that public figures in the media, the church and politics have voiced homophobic views, and that there have been numerous reports of acts of violence against gays but adds, \"Nevertheless it is understood that this attitude is not universal: police officers in Jamaica have protected homosexuals from violent assaults, and Jamaica's public defender, who has publicly condemned homophobic violence, has stated that the perpetrators must be punished. But he cited the reluctance of victims of assault to come forward as a reason for the failure of many investigations into homophobic attacks.\" </p> <p>The government is committed to protecting genuine refugees, and asylum is granted where case-workers are satisfied that an asylum seeker has a well-founded fear of persecution under the terms of the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees. </p> <p>Janet, a 38-year-old lesbian from Jamaica who has claimed asylum in the UK, is still waiting for a decision on her case from the Home Office. \"Whatever happens, I can't go back to Jamaica,\" she says. \"I'd rather die in the UK than be sent back.\" There are scars all over her body from the beatings she has received, part of the evidence she has submitted to immigration caseworkers. She has often needed hospital treatment as a result, but never told doctors and nurses why she had been assaulted. \"I've been beaten so many times when I've been out with friends that I could write a book about it,\" she says. \"I tried so many times to stop being a lesbian but it's the way my body works. It's the way I was born and I'll be myself until the day I die.\" </p> <p>One day, she says, she was at home with a female partner when a child from the neighbourhood saw them together and went round knocking on doors, telling people to come and see. \"A large crowd gathered outside my house and they beat down my front door. They kept shouting 'Sodomite girl, leave this place.' \" </p> <p>Janet claimed asylum in the UK two years ago. The year before she left Jamaica, she was coming home from a party when two men held up her taxi at traffic lights, forced her out of the car, demanded oral sex and raped her. \"I couldn't believe it the first time I saw a gay couple at a train station here being openly affectionate to each other,\" she says. \"There were lots of people around but none of them started beating or abusing the couple. Coming here, I felt safe for the first time. Gay people can lead an open life here.\" </p> <p>In Kingston, Brenda says she is determined to stay and to resist the intimidation as best she can. \"I'm 37 now and maybe by the time I'm in my 60s I'll see some tolerance of gay people appearing in Jamaican society. I hope things change in my lifetime.\"</p>",

  "<p>Kim Ki-duk likes to claim that he doesn't make films to shock. \"I make films thinking that life is beautiful,\" says the director. \"That embrace happiness and unhappiness. They are one.\" Anyone who has seen his film The Isle may disagree. The Isle lures people in with beautiful lakeland scenery, only to send them out vomiting, thanks to some horrific scenes involving fish-hooks. The film's UK release has been delayed until this September, as the British Board of Film Classification objected to scenes involving cruelty to fish and other creatures. Kim feels some remorse: \"We cooked all the fish we used in the film and ate them, expressing our appreciation. I've done a lot of cruelty on animals in my films. And I will have a guilty conscience for the rest of my life.\" </p> <p>The Isle is one of at least six new Korean movies that are coming to the UK in the next three months. In the past decade, South Korea's film industry has staged a miraculous renaissance, going from mediocre to a standard probably higher than Britain's. Last year it was one of the few places in the world where homemade films outsold Hollywood ones; and South Korean films have been scooping up major prizes at festivals like Cannes and Berlin, and are being exported in ever-greater quantities. </p> <p>The films heading for the UK are either horror movies (A Tale of Two Sisters) or dark thrillers featuring gruesome crimes (Memories of Murder). The country seems to excel at this type of hard-boiled material; there seems to be a distinctively Korean style emerging here and in previous releases like Nowhere to Hide, Sympathy for Mr Vengeance, and Bad Guy - a combination of art film sensibilities and commercial slickness, with a tone that floats somewhere between tragedy, horror and absurdity. For those who can stomach it, it's uniquely invigorating. </p> <p>Kim, who also directed Bad Guy, has reluctantly become something of a cheerleader in this department, although he is by no means a team player, or a typical Korean director. Before teaching himself film-making, he worked in factories, spent five years in the marines, and went to Paris to learn painting, despite not speaking a word of French. \"There are those who make films to make money, but I want to make films that conjure up questions about life,\" Kim says. His films have often conjured up more than just questions. In Bad Guy, a female student is abducted and forced into prostitution; the film drew criticism from women's groups. </p> <p>Kim made some amends with this year's Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter ... and Spring, a semi-abstract Buddhist parable set on a tiny floating monastery. Sumptuously photographed, universally accessible and relatively kind to fish (one gets tied to a rock), it was well-received around the world. Kim's latest, Samaritan Girl, has done even better, winning the Silver Bear at this year's Berlin film festival. </p> <p>The nearest Kim has to a soulmate is possibly Park Chan-wook, Korea's other rising international star. Park has enjoyed greater commercial success than Kim at home. His Joint Security Area, a tough thriller about escalating tensions with North Korea, became the country's most successful film ever back in 2000. His follow-up, Sympathy for Mr Vengeance, with its kidnappings, drownings and electrocutions, was too bleak for most audiences, but Park responded with Old Boy, which won him the Grand Jury prize at Cannes this year. Out here next year, Old Boy has been hailed as a Korean classic, although it still presents some challenges to the viewer. In one scene, the hero eats a live octopus. </p> <p>The gruesome streak running through these movies should perhaps be attributed less to the individuals than to the country in which they grew up. It's easy to forget what a turbulent 20th century Korea had. Having freed itself from Japanese occupation after the second world war, the country was thrown into its own civil war, by the end of which most of Korea's film heritage had been destroyed. </p> <p>\"Dark and aggressive\" is how director Bong Joon-ho describes 1980s Korea. \"But at the same time, it resembled a comedy. It was an irrational era.\" Bong's Memories of Murder provides a flavour of that time as it re-creates the story of the country's first serial killer, who murdered 10 women in the 1980s. The film focuses on the tragically/ comically inept police investigation, but includes background details such as schools practising \"blackout drills\" in anticipation of an invasion by North Korea. </p> <p>The end of South Korea's military dictatorship in 1992 opened the floodgates for the current period of cultural liberalisation. \"The political inspections have disappeared and we are now free to make movies on any topic,\" Bong says. \"Young and fresh-minded producers have entered the market. In other words, there has been a generation shift in the movie industry.\" </p> <p>Rather than censoring its film-makers, the government now supports them. A quota system, stipulating that Korean cinemas must screen local films at least 146 days per year, has encouraged investment. The Pusan film festival, established in 1996, has become one of Asia's main events and has supported and promoted the current generation, leading to a healthy level of activity across all genres. Studio films like Joint Security Area, Shiri and this year's big hit Taegukgi (all of which, to some extent, reference North-South tension) have regularly beaten the likes of Titanic and Harry Potter at the box office, and there is a consistent flow of high-school movies, melodramas, comedies, action thrillers, and animated movies. </p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, horror fans are well catered for. The country is now a regular contributor to the growing Asian horror trend started by the likes of Japan's Ring movies. Many of these mine similar territory - you can probably guess where the evil lurks with titles like Phone and Into the Mirror - though Kim Jee-woon's forthcoming ghost story A Tale of Two Sisters is a superior example, thanks to some powerful acting and beautiful production design. It is based on a Korean folk tale in which the siblings are terrorised by their evil stepmother; the director, however, also namechecks Robert Bresson, Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock and other western influences. \"Ten years ago, I didn't enjoy watching Korean movies,\" Kim says. \"But now there are a lot of talented people in the industry. However, I'm not saying the future of Korean cinema will be bright all the time. I think we need to try harder to make better films.\" </p> <p>How much better can Korean cinema get? The current boom undoubtedly has its roots in the repression of the past, and historically, that pent-up energy eventually dissipates. And international interest is notoriously fickle, as previous next-big-things like Hong Kong or Iran can testify. Despite the awards, directors like Kim Ki-duk and Park Chan-wook have yet to break out of the cult category. Domestically, the industry is in good health, but the quota system has been under attack for some time, particularly by the US. When a quota change was mooted in 1999, there were hunger strikes and boycotts of Hollywood films, and 100 film professionals shaved their heads in protest - an indication of the passion South Koreans now have for their cinema. Perhaps that's the only asset the country really needs.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Memories of Murder and A Tale of Two Sisters are out on August 13, The Phone on August 27, The Isle on September 10.</p>",
  "<p>Kuwait has banned Michael Moore's anti-Bush documentary, deeming it critical of the Iraq war and insulting to Saudi Arabia's royal family.</p> <p>An information ministry official from the Arab state, which was invaded by Iraq in 1990, said it could not show a movie that was disrespectful of an allied country.</p> <p>\"We have a law that prohibits insulting friendly nations, and ties between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are special,\" Abdul-Aziz Bou Dastour, cinema and production supervisor at the Kuwaiti information ministry, told Associated Press.</p> <p>He said the film \"insulted the Saudi royal family by saying they had common interests with the Bush family and that those interests contradicted the interests of the American people\".</p> <p>Dastour also says that the film criticised the US's Iraq invasion: \"This was tantamount to criticising Kuwait for [what it did] to liberate Iraq.\" </p> <p>\"The movie made Iraq look like a paradise whose problems started with the American invasion,\" Dastour said. \"It would have angered Kuwaitis.\" </p> <p>The movie was banned last month when the only cinema company in Kuwait, which is state-owned, was turned down for a licence to show the movie. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Saudi ambassador to Britain, Prince Turki al-Faisal, labelled Moore's movie \"grossly unfair\" in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph.

  "Peter Lewis arrived in Enfield in February as the council's director of education and leisure services, since when his feet have barely touched the ground. <p>He has visited 47 schools out of the borough's 82 (and plans to see them all by October), seven libraries, four leisure centres and a children's home - all on top of a hectic daytime job. </p> <p>On each visit he has taken his digital camera: \"The idea was to help me remember each place so that they weren't a complete blur,\" he admits. \"But I have been particularly impressed with the standard and quality of artwork in the schools. The kids are doing a lot they deserve to feel really proud of.\" </p> <p>Mr Lewis is working on what he sees as his main priority - the huge task of reorganising the work of the council so that it is more \"joined up\" and, crucially, reflects the government's new agenda, with its emphasis on children's services as an integral part of education. </p> <p>He wants to break down the barriers between the different departments and encourage more openness, with staff encouraged to reflect not just on their work but also on how they com municate with each other, headteachers, teachers, parents and other users. To this end, he has launched a consultation with staff. </p> <p>Crucially, Mr Lewis is determined to change a culture of \"low aspirations\" within some sectors of the local community and to tackle the knock-on effects of a high population turnover. \"Mobility is a big issue here in Enfield,\" he says. \"Related to that is growing numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, who have to be accommodated and are entitled to get follow-up services. We are facing an \u00a3800,000 bill for that.\" </p> <p>Mr Lewis, a native of north Staffordshire and formerly director of education and leisure services at Southampton, has moved to an authority which has made great strides in education, acknowledged in a positive Ofsted report published early last year. He describes the job as \"perfect\" for him because of his background - as a teacher, social worker and foster carer. </p> <p>Recruitment of social workers and teachers remains a priority, he said, and he has been talking to Middlesex University about building a core skills module into training appropriate for both jobs.</p>",
  "<p>No one who believes in democracy can possibly support the fire bombing of laboratories, physical assaults on research scientists and threats of violence against shareholders in biotechnology companies. </p> <p>But opposition to the way in which some \"animal liberationists\" behave and a willingness to make them respect the law should not obscure a basic truth about their cause. Experimenting on living animals - although sometimes necessary - is an activity that a civilised nation should find distasteful. </p> <p>Yet the news that a construction company - intimidated by \"animal rights activists\" - has abandoned work on a new Oxford laboratory has been greeted by an orgy of simplistic nonsense about the ethics of vivisection. One writer - admittedly related to a boy with an, as yet, incurable disease - actually asked if a human life was worth a puppy's pain. Of course it is. But that is the right answer to the wrong question. </p> <p>What society has to decide is whether the pain of innumerable puppies, even more rats, rabbits and mice and almost as many primates, is worth the possibility of finding the longed-for cure. Then we have to be sure that the suffering is the only way of discovering a remedy. The second question is technical. The first is moral. It concerns both what we think about animals and what we think about ourselves. </p> <p>Animals do not have rights in the accepted sense of the word. But humans have responsibilities towards all creatures great and small. I do not go quite as far as the extreme sect of Buddhists who believe that we have a duty to provide nourishing meals for fleas and other blood-sucking insects. It is, however, important not to walk on slugs and snails. And it is essential that we are revolted by the thought of live animals clamped in vices with tubes protruding from various parts of their anatomies - whether it is necessary or not. </p> <p>One critic of the anti-vivisection campaign argued that to worry about animal suffering is part of the anthropomorphic fallacy, which ought to be left to old ladies who tie ribbons in their poodles' hair and girls who want to take their ponies on holiday. He then went on to say that since animals habitually injure each other we should not worry unduly about experimenting on them in a good cause. </p> <p>The equation of human and animal morality is, of course, anthropomorphism gone mad. I expect humans to treat animals better than animals treat each other. We are a superior species with an ethical code that it is unreasonable to expect the lower order of mammals (not to mention fish and fowl) to observe. A society that is careless about animals' pain is likely to be casual about human suffering. Compassion is indivisible. </p> <p>So, in many ways, are primates. They are almost genetically indistinguishable from humans and they are equally difficult to separate from other members of the species. If you believe that humans have souls and that we alone go to heaven, it is easy to make a distinction between homo-sapiens and our hairy relatives. However, many of the scientists who experiment on animals have doubts about life after death. That means that they have a problem. So where do we draw the line in this dangerous game of intergenetic utilitarianism? Is experimenting on one human justified if 1,000 lives are saved? </p> <p>All those unanswered questions still leave us with the uncomfortable truth that animal experiments are likely to save human life - a contention usually associated with the assurance that scientists can be trusted to minimise both the number of tests and the amount of suffering that they cause. I wonder. Until the practice was prohibited, animals were used to ensure that cosmetics did not blind or burn those who used them. The never-ending fuss about the propriety of testing helps to keep the practice within bounds. </p> <p>It is, we are assured, a good financial bargain. \"Scientific research in Britain is worth \u00a39m a day\": that estimate was made by the journalist who equated one puppy's pain with a human life. No attempt was made to calculate how much pain or how many puppies were equated with an annual income of rather more than \u00a33bn. </p> <p>Scientists must be allowed to get on with the business of saving life. If that requires experimenting on animals, they have (metaphorically) to be pushed and jostled into ensuring that it is kept within bounds. And the rest of us have to be ashamed that it is necessary. </p> <p>Perhaps even those who profit from it are. Investors in biochemical companies complain that animal rights campaigners have revealed their names. If they are embarrassed by the way they make their money, they should draw their dividends elsewhere. Whatever else the animal liberationists have done, they have made us face up to what an ugly business animal experimentation is. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A banner hangs on the clocktower of Manchester's Victorian Gothic town hall: \"Get our Metrolink back on track',' it shouts to all who cross Albert Square. <p>The message refers to Manchester's efficient and much-loved tram system, whose big expansion plans were derailed by the transport secretary, Alistair Darling, in his announcement on transport strategy in the Commons last month. </p> <p>Mr Darling said he would no longer be offering the \u00a3520m promised for a \"big bang\" plan to create three new lines, serving Oldham, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Wythenshawe and Manchester airport. </p> <p>The scheme cost too much, he said: it had risen from \u00a3500m in 2002 to more than \u00a3800m. \"This decision was taken purely and simply because the costs have gone out of control,\" he told the Manchester Evening News two days later. </p> <p>The word at the tram stop now is that Mr Darling and his staff have been taken aback by the ferocity of the protest. </p> <p>\"The people of the conurbation regard this as their tram system,\" said Chris Mulligan, director general of the Greater Manchester passenger transport executive. I don't think ministers had reckoned on this level of public indignation. I think they are rattled.\" </p> <p>Last week Greater Manchester's Labour MPs began mustering and planning a campaign to convince ministers that it would be madness not to complete the tram network, a project that will create 6,300 new jobs and generate more than \u00a31bn in extra income each year. </p> <p>\"It is 18 years since we first tried to put trams on the streets of Manchester,\" said Graham Stringer, MP for Manchester Blackley and a former leader of Manchester city council. \"That was about 12 transport ministers ago. We have never taken no for an answer and won't take no for an answer this time.\" </p> <p>He said he and his colleagues had no advance warning that the transport secretary had changed his mind. \"We didn't know it was going to happen [until] 10 minutes before he stood up at the dispatch box. </p> <p>\"We guessed there might be a delay or a cut-back. But we had no idea he was going to say no to [the] whole of the big bang.\" </p> <p>The MPs and other campaigners will concentrate their fire on Mr Darling, Tony Blair and John Prescott. They will remind the prime minister that when he came north in 1999 to open the tram system's extension to Salford Quays he said: \"Metrolink is exactly the type of scheme needed to solve the transport problems of the metropolitan areas of the country.\" </p> <p>They will remind Mr Prescott that when he announced government funding for the big bang in 2000, he said Metrolink would become the envy of Europe. </p> <p>\"It is very much about an integrated transport system and Manchester has led the way,\" he added. \"Metrolink has encouraged people to use their cars less and public transport more. It's about the quality of life and about achieving our environmental objectives.\" </p> <p>Mr Darling appears to have been influenced by a National Audit Office (NAO) report this year which criticised the finances of some tram systems. </p> <p>But the MPs and members of the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority will point to the part where the NAO said: \"In contrast, the Manchester Metro has attracted so many passengers that it experiences overcrowding at peak times.\" </p> <p>Manchester's great and good have lashed out. Anthony Wison, founder of Factory Records, said: \"Metrolink is the greatest thing that has ever happened in the north-west and its extension should have been automatic.\" </p> <p>But it is the response of the region's tram users and would-be users that could prove most useful to local politicians. They want the agreed extensions - and the other line planned to run through desirable Didsbury to Stockport. </p> <p>Thousands have signed the \"back on the tracks\" petition launched by the Manchester Evening News. \"Betrayed!\" shouted the page one headline on the day Mr Darling announced his decision. Later the paper added a pair of boxing gloves to its masthead and bellowed: \"The gloves are off!\" </p> <p>\"The response has been astonishing - I cannot remember such a response to anything else in the city,\" said Paul Horrocks, the editor. \"I have never known so many businesses, councillors and newspaper readers come together on an issue so quickly.\" </p> <p>Mr Horrocks talks of the Commonwealth Games spirit - the kind of determination that created in Manchester one of the finest sporting events Britain has seen, in defiance of cynicism and obstacles from some in the south.</p>",
  "<p>When Mark Palios arrived at Soho Square with a reforming brief, the recruitment of a capable communications chief was near the top of his list of priorities. Colin Gibson, the sports editor of the Daily Mail and before that the Sunday Telegraph, was at the head of his short list. </p> <p>During his time at the Mail, Gibson was often behind some of the FA's most uncomfortable media moments. The paper's chief sports writer Jeff Powell was and remains virulently opposed to the appointment of Sven Goran-Eriksson as national coach, and the players' threat to strike last year was lambasted ferociously in Gibson's pages. </p> <p>As an accomplished poacher, however, Gibson seemed a good choice as the FA's new gamekeeper. Palios spent a lot of time courting Gibson, who was initially resistant to leave his influential job. </p> <p>But when last autumn that influence began to wane, with the Mail's editor Paul Dacre criticising the paper's Rugby World Cup coverage and reminding executives that the Mail's sports pages had predicted David Beckham would not leave Manchester United, Gibson thought again. He handed in his resignation after holding talks with Palios and securing a \u00a3150,000 annual salary. </p> <p>Initally at least Gibson proved popular and able. He was usually available to discuss the background to an issue before offering a measured on-the-record comment. He was also not averse to doing deals with papers, offering access to the manager in order to secure coverage of FA initiatives. </p> <p>At Euro 2004, his first major test, he largely balanced the media's demand for access to players with their requirement for privacy. When that privacy was breached by a paparazzo who captured long-lens photographs of David Beckham, Gibson threatened to withdraw access to any papers who used the picture. It was an empty threat. While the Mail and the Mirror backed off, the Sun did not suffer for using the picture. </p> <p>Given his knowledge of the tabloid agenda it remains baffling as to why Gibson did not kill the Faria Alam story before it had a chance to gain momentum. As a personal matter with no public-interest justification, the FA could have offered no comment at all. Instead Gibson's instinct to negotiate a solution seems to have cost him his job.</p>",
  "The Czech authorities are working on the theory that a bomb in the heart of Prague which injured 18 people yesterday, including five tourists from Britain and Ireland, was intended as an attack on an Israeli-owned casino. <p>The prime minister, Stanislav Gross, toured the area after the explosion and dismissed fears that it was linked to terrorism.

Both are in their early 20s. </p> <p>The three Irish people were discharged from hospital last night, according to the Irish department of foreign affairs. </p> <p>None of the five - two women and three men - was identified by their governments yesterday. </p> <p>\"British embassy officials went to the scene of the explosion and then to the local hospital,\" the Foreign Office said. Relatives were being informed. </p> <p>Initial reports suggested that the explosion was caused by at least one hand grenade being rolled under what may have been a parked armoured car. It was not clear whether it was part of an attempted robbery ora gangland feud. </p> <p>The Czech police said: \"We can rule out that it was a terrorist attack. It was a criminal act.\" The incident was being treated as attempted murder. </p> <p>Gambling is banned in Israel and a lucrative trade has grown up flying Israeli customers to newly established casinos in central and eastern Europe. Gangs often fight for control of the business. </p> <p>In August 2002 a Tel Aviv casino owner, Felix Abutbul, was shot in Prague. His floating casino off the Israeli port of Eilat was subsequently raided by the Israeli police. The Royal Casino in Prague was formerly owned by Mr Abutbul. </p> <p>An Israeli lawyer for the current owner, Assi Abutbul, told Israeli army radio that his client had been in a vehicle when Sunday's attack occurred, but had not been hurt, because the vehicle was armoured. The lawyer, Tsion Amir, said that Assi Abutbul had told him that his would-be assailants appeared to be Thai. </p> <p>The Czech police have been on high alert for many months, fearing that the country could become a target for attack by al-Qaida. </p> <p>The former communist state has been a member of Nato since 1999, and sent about 90 soldiers to Iraq as part of the US-led coalition. </p> <p>Israel's police chief, Moshe Karady, told Israeli army radio yesterday that there was a connection between the attack and crime groups of interest to the Israeli police.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Palios's tenure has been the briefest of any Football Association chief executive but also the most eventful. The public profile of the post and the feverish politics of the sport were the factors he could never master. They had always put him at risk in a stay that lasted a mere 13 months. </p> <p>That, of course, is not to portray him as a naif and a victim. He is suspected of being involved in a scheme that left Sven-Goran Eriksson, surely for the first time in his life, as the wronged party in a relationship. There is detailed evidence that the FA tried to cheat on him with the News of the World. </p> <p>An alleged sweetheart deal would have seen the England manager thrown to the tabloid wolves while Palios's own relationship with Faria Alam went unreported. Although his statement contained no confession of guilt, it is unlikely to be a coincidence that the chief executive resigned on the same day that the allegations were made. </p> <p>Palios was at his best when well away from intrigue. His experience in business recovery made him perfectly suited to his first challenge at Soho Square. At that point it was widely held that the FA could be brought to financial ruin by the strain of the Wembley project. The topic, though, was soon dropped as Palios got the enterprise under control. </p> <p>There were no such clean resolutions to events closer to the field. In November 2003 he decided that Alan Smith had to be removed from the England squad on the eve of a friendly with Denmark. The forward had been arrested and questioned the previous morning over the throwing of an empty plastic bottle at a Leeds game. </p> <p>At a press conference to discuss this Palios was asked why James Beattie had been called up while serving a driving ban. The bemused chief executive simply said he had not been aware of the fact. Others in the sport would have found it second nature to bluff. </p> <p>Palios, like his questioners, reflected on how badly briefed he had been. In the aftermath Colin Gibson, a former sports editor, was employed as FA communications director. Last night he, too, tendered his resignation. </p> <p>Gibson had hitherto done a good job of protecting Palios. He is now known to have liaised with the News of the World and spin doctors lose viability when their murky duties are exposed to daylight. It is no longer feasible for him sit at Eriksson's right hand in future press conferences as the manager's apparent ally. </p> <p>The England manager will not pine for Palios either. The tension, however, arose from the finest and bravest element of the chief executive's period at the FA. Once Rio Ferdinand failed to take a drugs test he refused to let him be in the England party for the key game with Turkey. </p> <p>The offence could have been played down. Palios, though, was unswerving in his determination to see the FA pursue the matter with the appropriate gravity. </p> <p>Several England players held a grudge and will savour his downfall. Who ever thought they would get their way? </p> <p>It could be quite some time before they learn who is to succeed him. The FA might look once more to their first choice before they turned to Palios. That was Peter Littlewood, who works for the Mars company in the United States. His negotiations last year did not come to fruition and he was believed to be uncertain as to whether there was enough support for him on the FA executive board. </p> <p>The present mayhem cannot make the job look any more attractive. That same conclusion might also be reached by targets such as the Premier League's impressive chief executive Richard Scudamore. </p> <p>Prior to Palios's arrival the duties were shared between Nic Coward, the director of legal affairs who left the FA by agreement this summer, and David Davies, the executive director, who now takes over the job on a temporary basis. It is symptomatic of the ruling body's embattled state that the future of Davies, like that of almost every leading figure, is in doubt. </p> <p>He remained in place despite ghosting Glenn Hoddle's controversial memoir of the 1998 World Cup but could have to give another demonstration of supreme survival skills. His conversation with Eriksson is claimed to have contributed to the initial, false denial of the Alam story. </p> <p>Geoff Thompson, the chairman, has comparable problems. His quick and unilateral declaration of Palios's innocence had annoyed board members even before the weekend accounts of an abortive cover-up. </p> <p>Eriksson, in theory, is the least vulnerable member of the hierarchy. The grounds for removing him look shaky. Before a largely hostile board try to show he lied or misled they will have to satisfy themselves that the FA was entitled to inquire into his sex life. </p> <p>They ought to fear any claim for wrongful dismissal. Imagine a barrister arguing that the FA, instead of exercising its duty of care, had attempted to feed Eriksson to a ravenous newspaper. It might now be impossible to force him out and the Swede, with \u00a314m guaranteed in earnings up to 2008, has cause to linger. </p> <p>It would take a virtuoso of negotiation to agree a severance package with Eriksson. Should the board consider that dismissals are unavoidable, then there will scarcely be enough employees left to man the Soho Square phones.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Ian Ridley </strong><br> Observer, August 1 </p> <p>\"The feeling grows that the 13-man FA board wants to believe that Sven-Goran Eriksson lied to them [about his affair with Faria Alam]. They are ready, indeed, to get shot of him, to the point where it now looks a question of when rather than if. Should the level of ranting and revelation remain at such a fever pitch for a further couple of days, he is unlikely even to make it through to Thursday's crisis meeting and board vote ... </p> <p>\"This is about the politics and economics of football and its governing body ... The suspicion here is that the FA board has been waiting for a valid reason ... to reestablish its authority. Ever since Adam Crozier swept into Lancaster Gate in 2000 with his modernising, media-savvy ways, there have been misgivings among the old guard.\" </p> <p><strong> News of the World </strong> <br> Editorial, August 1 </p> <p>\"Last Sunday ... we revealed evidence of Ms Alam's affair with Eriksson and FA chief executive Mark Palios. In response, the FA made an amazing offer: it would sacrifice Sven and Faria if we'd protect Mr Palios from public humiliation ... Not only was the FA cooking up the shabby deal behind Sven's back, but it was vainly trying to railroad an unwilling Faria into con-fessing all to save the boss ... Since then, with breathtaking cheek, the FA has falsely claimed the squalid 'trade-off' was our idea ... </p> <p>\"The FA has hit a new low ... Honesty and transparency are much-needed qualities in Soho Square. In the days ahead, there may be FA moves to oust its serial philandering coach. If that happens, a full-scale clear-out must follow, too.\" </p> <p><strong> Patrick Collins </strong> <br>Mail on Sunday, August 1 </p> <p>\"A group of Premiership footballers discussed the England manager at a training ground last week. There was nudging and giggling and a good deal of prurient speculation ... It was the mocking laughter that lingered in the memory ... Eriksson could have survived disapproval, even hostility, but mockery was a step too far. Mockery was telling him it was time to leave ... </p> <p>\"Sven may amuse himself with an entire troupe of Swedish weather girls, or a legion of compliant secretaries, if that is his inclination. But he does so in the knowledge that discovery will bring derision and loss of dignity, and that his ability to advise the players he commands will be hopelessly compromised. It is not his morality which causes concern, it is his judgment. And that judgment has proved calamitous.\" </p> <p><strong> Hugh McIlvanney </strong> <br>Sunday Times, August 1 </p> <p>\"Eriksson, whether because of vanity, or crassness, or a helpless inability to curb his carnal appetites, has indulged himself with such apparently smug disregard for the implications that it is impossible to think of him as a victim ... </p> <p>\"This week, there is pressure on the manager to prove he responded honestly to the exposure of the Soho Square affairs ... We have been told he could argue that just asking him about the episode was a violation of his human rights. He may make himself fireproof in law and protest his compensation. But any claims he has to being a square dealer are at risk of being badly scorched.\" </p> <p><strong> Sunday Mirror</strong> <br>Editorial, August 1 </p> <p>\"Doesn't the continuing will-he-go, will-he-stay saga involving Eriksson boil down to just one thing? </p> <p>\"A sad case of balding, overpaid, middle-aged men at the FA trying to protect their fat pay cheques while getting their leg over the office secretary.\"</p>",
  "<p>It has been said that television offers a window on the world. It is just that the panes are often obscured by adverts and the frame has not been cleaned since the 60s. All the same, it seems hard to deny that more of the world is being squeezed into view than ever before.</p> <p>For one case study, take last weekend, when fever over the Copa America final caused several of my mates to get a substantial drunk on, pulling my frail carcass along with them. It seemed slightly weird that they were getting so excited about a tournament no one knew existed half a dozen years ago. Today you can probably have text message updates sent to your phone if you were worried about missing Peru versus Uruguay.</p> <p>As time goes on it gets more difficult to get excited about mediocre British fare when you can cherry-pick the best events from around the world.</p> <p>To prove the point, this past weekend I spurned the opportunity of watching county cricket and went on assignment to a Walkabout bar, part of a chain so Australian it has ersatz Aboriginal drawings on the walls and calls its toilets \"dunnies\". It was showing the Tri-Nations match between Australia and South Africa from Perth. It is rugby but not as we Britons know it - no playing for touch, no endless succession of penalties, just powerful running, passing and thumping for 80 minutes. God knows why they bother, really.</p> <p>With some punters even going Walkabout by 10.30am so they could catch a squat bloke in a huge Stetson warble Waltzing Matilda, the crowd in the hostelry was touching 200. It was easy to tell the Aussies, decked out almost uniformly in replica kit. But, though almost half the crowd were Springbok fans, there was not one green shirt in the pub. It is a difficult one to explain, though fear of being assaulted by someone who had just woken from a coma sustained in the 80s might explain it.</p> <p>Instead they were dressed according to that antipodean code of baggy combat shorts, tight T-shirts with small logos in the middle (\"koala beach surf\", that sort of thing) and wrap-around Oakley sunglasses - indoors. Their British mates were there too, designer labels on show, watching rugby as it was supposed to be played, mate.</p> <p>The game was on Sky TV, obviously, but the coverage was Australian. I was hoping that might lead to some amusing commentary - \"He's shaking like a chook on its first day of uni\" and so on but the closest moment came when Stirling Mortlock manfully put his groin in the way of a clearance and slumped to the floor. \"Sack ...of ... spuds. Straight down,\" said the commentator Gordon Bray, with the kind of play on the word \"sack\" that would have pleased Barry Humphries.</p> <p>There were some differences in broadcasting style to admire. Get your head around the concept of dressing-room cameras which, while not offering sound, allow viewers to observe the teams during half-time. Surprisingly this reveals little about what goes on in the inner sanctum, mainly being pictures of huge men sitting around in semi-circles, their eyes gazing at the floor, shooting dice for thousands of dollars. The last bit is not true, of course. They were actually baiting badgers.</p> <p>Another innovation was that the entire match was turned over to promoting Bundaberg rum. Obviously it would be naive to be shocked by corporate predominance at a sporting event. Awe is more the word, however, when confronted by the dozens of ways Bundy got its name in front of the cameras - from handing free, bright yellow T-shirts to attractive girls in the crowd, to colonising the hoardings, to dyeing their logo on the grass, to hanging banners from the stands, to placing little foam coverings on the line markers. Whoever sells sponsorship at the Subiaco Oval is doing a great job.</p> <p>Sadly, Bundy was not available behind the bar of the Walkabout, at least not at lunchtime, and maybe that explains the stunning sobriety of the crowd. If England were to play a football friendly with Australia at the Subiaco Oval, brought to you by Bundy, it would be a certainty that someone would be rechewing his breakfast by half-time. Yet not only were there no paralytics on Saturday, there were no rowdies either. One huge blond Bok fan managed to pass the whole game drinking only two pints and he was not even barracked by his mates.</p> <p>I am sorry to end this piece with something of a sermon but perhaps a booming expansion in the number of sports available to the British viewer will be a good thing for the culture. Watching more Aussie rugby might teach us temperance and more live NBA might show us the right way to wear a baseball cap.</p> <p>In a couple of generations' time, with the right live sport, we could be perfect. Yet Sky followed Saturday's thriller from Perth with an afternoon of South African provincial rugby. It is globalisation, Clyde, but not as we know it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Martin Kelner returns next week</p>",
  "<p>'A -T-H-E-N-S,\" Michael Phelps says quietly as he spells out the name of the ancient city he has carried inside himself for so long. The 6ft 4in American swimmer with the size 14 feet and the even bigger hope of becoming the sensation of the 2004 Olympic Games pauses dramatically. He can remember all the moments when he has stared at those same six letters. </p> <p>\"Back in the winter, at 5.30am, when I didn't want to get up and train on some cold and dark morning I'd still make myself snap on the light and look inside my swimming cap. 'Athens' is stitched on the inside. I'd get up then. I'd grab my bag and head for the pool. I've been doing that 365 days - year after year. I can't remember the last day I didn't train. Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, New Year's Day. I haven't missed one of 'em for years. And every single day I got that word, Athens, running right round my head.\" </p> <p>A week on Saturday, on the first day of Olympic competition, Phelps will take to the pool in Athens and begin his outrageously ambitious tilt at sporting history. Marketing men, merchandisers, sponsors and television executives around the world are all lurking and smacking their greedy chops at the prospect of an amiable and strangely unspoiled 19-year-old matching their voracity as he tries to swim down the record seven gold medals Mark Spitz won at the 1972 games in Munich. Speedo have guaranteed Phelps a cool and instant $1m if he fulfils the seven-gold fantasy. </p> <p>Last month, having dominated the US trials, Phelps confirmed that he will swim the butterfly over 100m and 200m, the 200m and 400m individual medleys and the 200m freestyle in Athens. He also hopes to feature in three American relays, which means that Phelps could swim 20 races in eight days. There is, after all, another Olympic record to chase. In the 1980 Moscow games, the Russian gymnast Aleksandr Dityatin won three gold medals, four silvers and a bronze. Eight medals of different colours may be more plausible than seven straight golds but even this target is the product of hype rather than a reflection of Phelps's own calm expectations. </p> <p>\"The whole seven-gold deal was between Speedo and my agent. They agreed it. If I bring back only one gold people are going to say it's a disappointment. But not too many of them own an Olympic gold medal so if I get one I'm going to be happy. That's the important one - the first gold. I'm just focusing on that for now. After that, the best thing is to keep my options open. I don't want to put a limit on anything. The more you dream the more you achieve. So on the inside I'm real pumped about Athens and what might happen - but I try not to think about it too much. I leave that to everyone else.\" </p> <p>While the statistical possibilities are intriguing, Phelps himself emerges as the real story. He comes from a broken home in Baltimore, a gritty red-brick but blue-collar city more usually associated with a downbeat cop series like Homicide than the sunlit pools of California which the moustached and bronzed Spitz represented. His father, Fred, a policeman, and his mother, Debbie, a school teacher, separated when he was only seven. </p> <p>Echoes of a traumatic past are heard in his sister Whitney's memories that, on her way to being picked for the US swim team at the age of 14 in 1994, she used the pool as a refuge from trouble at home. \"I didn't have to listen to people yelling,\" Whitney said. \"It was my escape. I took a lot of anger and beat it out - just me and the bottom of the pool.\" </p> <p>Phelps, meanwhile, says, \"I feel most at home in the water. I disappear. That's where I belong.\" </p> <p>Phelps and his father apparently argued bitterly just before last year's world championship in Barcelona. Fred Phelps, supposedly, missed his son's high school graduation party after he had been told that two complimentary tickets to Spain were going to his estranged wife and eldest daughter, Hilary. The spat, since resolved according to Phelps, did not diminish his astonishing performance in Barcelona - where he won four gold medals and smashed five world records in a week. </p> <p>Barcelona proved that, for all the promotional bluster, Phelps has an almost eerie ability to block out distractions. His coach, Bob Bowman, has spoken of the need to sometimes \"physically shake\" the swimmer to drag him out of a trance-like reverie just before a big race. </p> <p>\"I was in a zone in Barcelona,\" Phelps agrees when he recalls breaking two world records in the space of 45 minutes. \"That night was very big. I went into it with the clear aim of becoming the first man to set two world records in two different events on the same night. When it happened it was extremely exciting. It showed that it's possible to shoot for something and accomplish it - but I was so tired at the end I could hardly climb out of the pool. Athens is going to be even more physically and mentally draining.\" </p> <p>A psychological battle has been brewing between Phelps and Ian Thorpe - the world's best swimmer for so long. In Barcelona they raced each other only in Phelps's favoured 200m medley. He cruised away from Thorpe in an imposing swim. More tellingly, Phelps won one more gold than the trio picked up by the Australian. </p> <p>Four years ago, at the Sydney Olympics, the Thorpedo was unstoppable. He won three golds while the 15 year-old Phelps finished fifth in the 200m butterfly final. \"It was a different time. Thorpe was incredible while I was just proud to have made the US team. But I ended up disappointed because I wanted a medal. It was a learning experience - my first international meet and my first time out of America. When I got back to school in Baltimore no one asked me about the Olympics. Everybody just asked whether I'd seen any kangaroos hopping around or koala bears up in the trees. I told them Australia was the same as America - except the people were nicer.\" </p> <p>The Australians have since become more vitriolic. \"Look,\" said Don Talbot, the Australian swimming coach in Barcelona last year, \"I don't wish to denigrate Michael Phelps - he's a great talent - but those who talk about him in terms of being as great as Ian must be out of their minds.\" </p> <p>Thorpe himself dismisses Phelps's pursuit of a mythic seven gold medals in Athens by insisting that \"it's unattainable for me and it's unattainable for anyone.\" </p> <p>Phelps counters: \"He's saying it's impossible for him. That's all. I'm trying something for me. In Barcelona I was honoured to have the chance to race against him. He's mainly a freestyle swimmer while my strength's in the butterfly and medley. But he took me on in one of my events. I won that time but in Athens I'm going to do something I've always wanted to do - swim freestyle against Thorpe.\" </p> <p>When Phelps races the imperious Thorpe towards the end of his eight-day marathon in Athens he will almost certainly be exhausted. He might have picked up three of a likely four gold-medal haul by then but he will struggle in Thorpe's best event - especially as another Australian, Grant Hackett, and the Dutch world champion Pieter van Hoogenband will also push him hard. </p> <p>\"The way I look at it, this is an opportunity for me to swim in probably the fastest 200 free in history. I'm going to be, at the very least, competitive. It's going to be some race.\" </p> <p>The Thorpe-Phelps stand-off will almost certainly be billed as the swim of the games - and perhaps even the clash of the whole Olympics. Thorpe, whom Phelps replaced as the world's swimmer of the year in 2003, will be desperate to assert his authority over the aspiring king of the Olympic pool. </p> <p>Phelps, for now, is happy to highlight the difference between their current lives. While Thorpe is used to personal invites from Tom Cruise and Giorgio Armani to movie premieres or fashion shows, Phelps lives a more anonymous life. Asked whether he would choose to strut down the red carpet with Nicole Kidman on his arm or simply put in another woofer in his beloved old Cadillac, Phelps is amusingly evasive. \"I dunno. Tough one. Seriously. I'm used to just hanging out at my mom's and fooling around with my car. I can walk around downtown Baltimore very easily. It sometimes seems as if no one knows who the hell I am. I hardly ever get stopped in public. In a way it's good because I can live my life the way I want. But in another way it's kinda disappointing because there's a total lack of recognition for swimming. I think it's a real pity because we have so many talented American swimmers and they never get the same publicity Thorpe is given in Australia - where swimming is taken more seriously than any other country.\" </p> <p>Athens will probably change everything - and the signs are already there with the American money men putting him and Cindy Crawford together on stage last month as he announced his Olympic schedule - but for now Phelps remains stimulating and engaging company. It's hard not to like a guy who can eat eight fried eggs, eight slices of toast and a whole melon for breakfast and then, with barely a burp, consider the cultural clash embedded in his contrasting passion for gangsta rap and swimming. How many other swimmers in the relentlessly white pool can talk cogently about the machine-gun rapper Twista or name-check Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready To Die as the bleak inspiration which motivates them during his daily 10-mile thrash through the water? </p> <p>\"I just like the sound of hip hop,\" Phelps says. \"I love Jay-Z and 50 Cent and I'm a huge Biggie (Smalls) fan. I listen to rap on the way to practice and whatever I've been playing just loops through my head as I swim.\" </p> <p>During the last month Overnight Celebrity by Twista has filled Phelps's head more than any other track. It seems a curiously appropriate ditty by a warp-speed rapper, the fastest mouth in the business for the fastest kid in the water. While Phelps has been a swim-star for years, a series of glittering performances in Athens will turn him into a mass-market celebrity. </p> <p>\"Away from the Olympics I've got a pretty quiet life. It's kinda boring. I haven't got a girlfriend and I can't do the kind of things all my friends are doing as college students. I swim, listen to hip hop and work on my car. But, in my opinion, that's still a pretty good life. I don't know whether I'd want to trade it for anything.\" </p> <p>His ambition as a great swimmer, however, will transform his life later this month. He might not win the impossible seven but Phelps, the flying Twista of the pool with a giant 6ft 7in armspan, will cut an irresistible figure in Athens. And, afterwards, Cindy Crawford will probably want to see him again. But she'd better be ready to hang out in Baltimore where Michael Phelps, hopefully, will still eat eight fried eggs for breakfast and listen to Biggie Smalls in his old Cadillac while, in true bling bling style, he counts the gold medals hanging round his neck.</p>",
  "<p>James Toseland had a difficult time here yesterday but still has a fighting chance of bringing the World Superbike championship to Britain. </p> <p>The 23-year-old from Yorkshire entered the European round leading by three points from his team-mate in the Ducati Fila works team, the Frenchman R\u00e9gis Laconi. But Toseland scored a solitary seventh place and ended up trailing Laconi by eight points after two astonishing races. </p> <p>Laconi crashed out of the lead in the second race little more than 20 miles from the finish. He could have gone to the next round in Holland with a handsome cushion in the points table but now any one of four riders can take the title. Laconi leads on 218 points, two ahead of Honda's Chris Vermeulen. Noriyuki Haga, riding for Britain's Renegade Ducati Koji team, is in third place on 212 points after a spectacular double victory here yesterday. Toseland is on 210 points and has three rounds and six races left to try to capture his first world title. </p> <p>Critics say that the owners of the superbike championship, the Italian company FG Sport, have weakened the spectacle by introducing a one-make tyre rule for 2004 and drastically lowering the cost of competition. The truth is the series now offers the most unpredictable racing in motorcycle sport. </p> <p>That was evident from the start yesterday. Haga, the Australian Steve Martin and Italy's Pierfrancesco Chili put privately owned Ducatis on the front row alongside Laconi's factory bike. Then the quartet staged a display of dramatic racing to thrill the crowd. </p> <p>Haga and Laconi swapped the lead for four laps. Chili took over until he crashed on the seventh. Laconi and Haga then battled it out for the remainder of the race until the Japanese rider overtook his adversary three times on the final lap to take the win by a tenth of a second. \"My front tyre went and it was difficult to control the bike,\" Haga said. \"But I saw that Laconi couldn't brake hard because his tyre had gone, too. He left a gap on the last corner and I went inside.\" </p> <p>The former world champion Carl Fogarty celebrated the most encouraging result of his two-year term as a team owner when the Australian Troy Corser brought his Foggy Petronas FP1 into fifth place. The bike has scored two podium places in wet conditions but this was a hard charge on a dry track that left Corser only eight seconds behind Haga. </p> <p>\"We have a new cylinder head and 185 horsepower at the rear wheel,\" said the team's chief engineer Steve Thompson. \"We hope to get another five to 10 horsepower from another engine that we will soon be testing.\" </p> <p>Toseland had a day to forget. He climbed to seventh place in the first race after starting from 12th on the grid and claimed that poor bike settings prevented further progress. That left Laconi leading the championship and the picture then looked even bleaker for Toseland when he pulled off the track on the fourth lap of the second race with oil leaking on to his rear tyre. But he was gifted a second chance after the Italian Giancarlo de Matteis crashed at Paddock Hill on the same lap and officials ruled a restart from the third-lap positions. Toseland lasted until the second corner at Druids when he and Corser collided. </p> <p>With Haga and Laconi resuming their first-race skirmish, the Briton's title hopes were helped when Laconi shot on to the grass after 15 laps. Haga held off Chili to claim his fourth win of the season and Vermeulen wheeled his Honda Fireblade into the final podium position. Chris Walker delivered another strong performance for Foggy Petronas with fourth position ahead of the 23-year-old Yamaha rider James Ellison.</p> <p><strong>'Losing is not an option now'</strong></p> <p>James Toseland believes the race for the World Superbike crown is far from over despite the Yorkshire rider slipping from first to fourth in the rankings after taking just nine points from a possible 50 at Brands Hatch. </p> <p>Toseland now lies eight points adrift of R\u00e9gis Laconi but is convinced he can win the championship with six races of the season remaining. </p> <p>\"I refuse to lose this championship,\" he said. \"Losing is not an option. </p> <p>\"From now on it's going to be a case of applying controlled aggression because there's a fine line between riding on the right side and being dangerous.\"</p>",

  "A leading British organisation on Islamic law has issued a fatwa on Lucozade, saying Muslims can drink the soft drink despite it containing alcohol. <p>The religious ruling has been welcomed by the drink's maker, GlaxoSmithKline.</p> <p>It sought the judgment after being contacted by Muslims concerned at rumours that Lucozade was made with alcohol. Lucozade does have a trace amount which is permitted by food laws, but Muslims feared that consuming it might breach their religion.</p> <p>Ribena was also given the all-clear. The drink was a potential problem for Muslims because during its production process a filter is used made from gelatin, derived from pigs.</p> <p>Some Muslims have stopped buying both the drinks.</p> <p>The company undertook a five-month process to have both drinks declared halal (clean) under Islamic law. The ruling means that Lucozade and Ribena are the first British soft drinks declared fit for Muslims to consume.</p> <p>Lucozade contains 0.01% of ethyl alcohol to ensure the flavouring permeates the whole drink.</p> <p>The company approached the UK Muslim Law (Shariah) Council to rule on whether its products were haram (forbidden by Islamic law).</p> <p>Its chairman, Zaki Badawi, a former adviser on Islam to the Prince of Wales, concluded: \"I see no harm in consuming Ribena and Lucozade which contain traces of ethyl alcohol and animal ingredients that do not bear their original qualities and do not change the taste, colour or smell of the product.\"</p> <p>Tiny amounts of alcohol occur naturally in many drinks and foods, such as bread.</p> <p>To reach the ruling the company recreated an incident from the life of the Prophet Muhammad when he drank liquid produced from soaking raisins in water for several days, called nabith. The scientists found that the mixture would ferment, producing alcohol.</p> <p>The results of the experiment helped Dr Badawi reach his decision.</p>",
  "Prosecutors investigating the kidnapping and murder of a prominent Mexican doctor who was named woman of the year in 1997 have arrested a former policeman and a private security guard employed to patrol the Mexico City street where she lived. <p>In videotaped confessions shown to reporters, the former policeman, Noe Hiniestra, told how he and his gang intercepted Carmen Gutierrez as she drove to work on July 22. He said that despite reaching a ransom agreement with her husband, they decided to kill Mrs Gutierrez two days later, because \"we got nervous\". </p> <p>Her body was found dumped in a sewage canal on the eastern outskirts of the capital, but the crime was not made public for almost a week, when it caused an outrage. </p> <p>There is growing pressure on Mexico's local and federal governments to reduce violent crime, particularly kidnapping, which began to cause concern a decade ago and now appears to be out of control. </p> <p>A month ago hundreds of thousands of people marched through central Mexico City to demand an end to the phenomenon, which terrifies Mexican families from the middle class upwards. </p> <p>International security companies estimate that there are 3,000 kidnappings a year in Mexico. The official total is about 500. </p> <p>Many families do not report kidnappings for fear that corrupt elements in the police are colluding with criminal gangs. </p> <p>Distrust of the police leads many Mexicans to employ private security guards to watch over their families or their neighbourhoods. </p> <p>The Gutierrez case suggests that these guards are not necessarily any more trustworthy than the police. </p> <p>Mrs Gutierrez's colleagues at the hospital where she worked demanded harder efforts to to find her killers and an end to the impunity with which kidnappers seem to operate. </p> <p>Mrs Gutierrez, a graduate of Mexico's National Autonomous University, had done postgraduate work in London. </p> <p>The Mexican president, Vicente Fox, sent his personal condolences to her family. </p> <p>\"The loss of a woman like her, who had dedicated her life to doing good for others, is an insult to our entire society, and an irreparable loss,\" he wrote. </p> <p>The capital's police chief, Marcelo Ebrard, set up a special investigation squad, which led to the arrests within hours. </p> <p>Mr Ebrard said fingerprints on the doctor's abandoned car were traced to the former policeman, who was dismissed from the force four years ago for unspecified \"bad conduct\". </p> <p>Mr Hiniestra allegedly acted with his uncle, who was employed by Mrs Gutierrez's family and their neighbours to guard their street. A third suspect worked as a gardener. </p> <p>The gang were reportedly arrested in possession of the victim's car and house keys, her watch and her jewellery. The police said they were on the trail of at least one more member of the gang, a taxi driver called David. </p> <p>Mexican newspapers reported that the security guard's girlfriend, who worked as a maid in Mrs Gutierrez's house, had been released after questioning. </p> <p>The attorney general's office told the Associated Press on Saturday that it was also investigating the participation of a Colombian security company which Mrs Gutierrez's family hired to help them negotiate with the kidnappers. </p> <p>Earlier this year the attorney general blamed such firms for exacerbating the problem by discouraging victims from going to the police, whom he insisted were getting cleaner. </p> <p>According to Mr Hiniestra's taped confession, the gang first asked for 2m pesos, about \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>In frantic negotiations over two days the demand rapidly fell until a ransom of 163,000 pesos was agreed. </p> <p>But the alleged kidnapper said he had become jumpy because of noise on the line the last time he talked to Mrs Gutierrez's husband, so the gang decided to kill the doctor. </p> <p>\"We walked her down to the [sewage] canal, and then Eliazar [another suspect] put a rope around her neck and began strangling her,\" Mr Hiniestra said on the tape. </p> <p>\"We let go of her, and threw her in the canal, but she didn't die, so we went down and we held her under the surface until she stopped breathing. </p> <p>\"Then we each went our separate way.\"</p>",
  "If proof were needed that Tony Blair is off the hook over Iraq, it came not during the Commons debate on the Butler report on July 21, but rather at his monthly press conference the following morning. Asked about the crisis in Sudan, Mr Blair replied: \"I believe we have a moral responsibility to deal with this and to deal with it by any means that we can.\" This last phrase means that troops might be sent - as General Sir Mike Jackson, the chief of the general staff, immediately confirmed - and yet the reaction from the usual anti-war campaigners was silence. <p>Mr Blair has invoked moral necessity for every one of the five wars he has fought in this, surely one of the most bellicose premierships in history. The bombing campaign against Iraq in December 1998, the 74-day bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1999, the intervention in Sierra Leone in the spring of 2000, the attack on Afghanistan in October 2001, and the Iraq war last March were all justified with the bright certainties which shone from the prime minister's eyes. Blair even defended Bill Clinton's attack on the al-Shifa pharmaceuticals factory in Sudan in August 1998, on the entirely bogus grounds that it was really manufacturing anthrax instead of aspirin. </p> <p>Although in each case the pretext for war has been proved false or the war aims have been unfulfilled, a stubborn belief persists in the morality and the effectiveness of attacking other countries. The Milosevic trial has shown that genocide never occurred in Kosovo - although Blair told us that the events there were worse than anything that had happened since the second world war, even the political activists who staff the prosecutor's office at the international criminal tribunal in The Hague never included genocide in their Kosovo indictment. And two years of prosecution have failed to produce one single witness to testify that the former Yugoslav president ordered any attacks on Albanian civilians in the province. Indeed, army documents produced from Belgrade show the contrary. </p> <p>Like the Kosovo genocide, weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as we now know, existed only in the fevered imaginings of spooks and politicians in London and Washington. But Downing Street was also recently forced to admit that even Blair's claims about mass graves in Iraq were false. The prime minister has repeatedly said that 300,000 or 400,000 bodies have been found there, but the truth is that almost no bodies have been exhumed in Iraq, and consequently the total number of such bodies, still less the cause of their deaths, is simply unknown. </p> <p>In 2001, we attacked Afghanistan to capture Osama bin Laden and to prevent the Taliban from allegedly flooding the world with heroin. Yet Bin Laden remains free, while the heroin ban imposed by the Taliban has been replaced by its very opposite, a surge in opium production, fostered by the warlords who rule the country. As for Sierra Leone, the United Nations human development report for 2004, published on July 15, which measures overall living standards around the world, puts that beneficiary of western intervention in 177th place out of 177, an august position it has continued to occupy ever since our boys went in: Sierra Leone is literally the most miserable place on earth. So much for Blair's promise of a \"new era for Africa\". </p> <p>The absence of anti-war scepticism about the prospect of sending troops into Sudan is especially odd in view of the fact that Darfur has oil. For two years, campaigners have chanted that there should be \"no blood for oil\" in Iraq, yet they seem not to have noticed that there are huge untapped reserves in both southern Sudan and southern Darfur. As oil pipelines continue to be blown up in Iraq, the west not only has a clear motive for establishing control over alternative sources of energy, it has also officially adopted the policy that our armies should be used to do precisely this. Oddly enough, the oil concession in southern Darfur is currently in the hands of the China National Petroleum Company. China is Sudan's biggest foreign investor. </p> <p>We ought, therefore, to treat with scepticism the US Congress declaration of genocide in the region. No one, not even the government of Sudan, questions that there is a civil war in Darfur, or that it has caused an immense number of refugees. Even the government admits that nearly a million people have left for camps outside Darfur's main towns to escape marauding paramilitary groups. The country is awash with guns, thanks to the various wars going on in Sudan's neighbouring countries. Tensions have risen between nomads and herders, as the former are forced south in search of new pastures by the expansion of the Sahara desert. Paramilitary groups have practised widespread highway robbery, and each tribe has its own private army. That is why the government of Sudan imposed a state of emergency in 1999. </p> <p>But our media have taken this complex picture and projected on to it a simple morality tale of ethnic cleansing and genocide. They gloss over the fact that the Janjaweed militia come from the same ethnic group and religion as the people they are allegedly persecuting - everyone in Darfur is black, African, Arabic-speaking and Muslim. Campaigners for intervention have accused the Sudanese government of supporting this group, without mentioning that the Sudanese defence minister condemned the Janjaweed as \"bandits\" in a speech to the country's parliament in March. On July 19, moreover, a court in Khartoum sentenced six Janjaweed soldiers to horrible punishments, including the amputation of their hands and legs. And why do we never hear about the rebel groups which the Janjaweed are fighting, or about any atrocities that they may have committed? </p> <p>It is far from clear that the sudden media attention devoted to Sudan has been provoked by any real escalation of the crisis - a peace agreement was signed with the rebels in April, and it is holding. The pictures on our TV screens could have been shown last year. And we should treat with scepticism the claims made for the numbers of deaths - 30,000 or 50,000 are the figures being bandied about - when we know that similar statistics proved very wrong in Kosovo and Iraq. The Sudanese government says that the death toll in Darfur, since the beginning of the conflict in 2003, is not greater than 1,200 on all sides. And why is such attention devoted to Sudan when, in neighbouring Congo, the death rate from the war there is estimated to be some 2 or 3 million, a tragedy equalled only by the silence with which it is treated in our media? </p> <p>We are shown starving babies now, but no TV station will show the limbless or the dead that we cause if we attack Sudan. Humanitarian aid should be what the Red Cross always said it must be - politically neutral. Anything else is just an old-fashioned colonial war - the reality of killing, and the escalation of violence, disguised with the hypocritical mask of altruism. If Iraq has not taught us that, then we are incapable of ever learning anything. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Laughland is an associate of Sanders Research Associates </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jlaughland@sandersresearch.com\">jlaughland@sandersresearch.com</a></p>",
  "A horse thought to be extinct for 1,000 years is alive and well and living in Rutland. <p>Celebrated in the ancient world as a chariot horse for racing and in battle, and presented to kings and emperors as a valuable gift, the caspian horse was thought to have disappeared in antiquity. </p> <p>Drawings of the distinctive horse can be seen on 3,000-year-old terracotta plaques in the British Museum and on the seal of King Darius the Great from Persepolis in ancient Persia. They were probably used to pull chariots in the battle against Alexander the Great. </p> <p>In 1965, a small but beautiful horse was discovered in a remote village in Iran on the shores of the Caspian Sea, being used to pull carts. Louise Firouz, an American who was married to one of the Shah of Iran's sons, bought it for her children to ride. </p> <p>She realised the horse belonged to a unique breed with great qualities of speed and temperament. There were still five pure-bred animals in the village and she managed to buy three. Later other horses were found, including some wild ones in the mountains. </p> <p>Nearly 40 years later, with the help of the latest DNA technology, enough pure-bred horses of different strains have been found to ensure genetic diversity and the survival of the species. </p> <p>To celebrate, the president of the worldwide Caspian Horse Society, Pat Bowles, who lives in Rutland with 16 of the pure-bred horses, has organised a conference from August 11 to 13 at which Louise Firouz will be speaking. Caspian enthusiasts from around the world will discuss a further breeding programme and hold a breed show at Castle Bytham, near Oakham, on August 14. </p> <p>Ms Bowles said that although the caspians were smaller than modern horses - about 11.3 hands compared with a modern racehorse at 16 - they were as fast. She breeds both. </p> <p>\"They have light frames and thin bones which are incredibly strong. They are not like ponies, which are piggy and can be bloody-minded. They are slim, narrow, elegant and fast.\" </p> <p>Pure-bred brood mares are worth between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000. There are still wild caspians in the mountains in Iran and the government has banned their export, fearing that they will be lost to the country. Iranian experts are speaking at the Rutland conference. </p> <p>There are now 1,300 pure-bred Caspians registered with the society and a further unknown number in Iran. Horses still being found in rural Iran are tested to check if they are pure-bred Caspians, and if so become valuable animals.</p>"
