  "The government moved yesterday to reassure voters that it is getting the upper hand against low-level street crime and yobbish behaviour when it unveiled measures to improve witness protection in so-called \"Asbo\" cases. <p>With David Blunkett, the home secretary, this week due to issue his first annual report on the progress of the anti-social behaviour order (Asbo) strategy, his cabinet colleague, Lord Falconer, flagged up procedural reforms that ministers hope will encourage people to speak out against menacing neighbours. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett will give an audit of the number of Asbos taken out by councils and announce that 50 more areas will be given assistance in how to handle the new process. The controversial dispersal orders - telling local gangs to move on - have been used 400 times, he revealed last week. </p> <p>By focusing on the message that law-abiding citizens who take a stand will get the support they need, Lord Falconer claimed he will be \"rebalancing\" the justice system in favour of victims of crime and away from its perpetrators. </p> <p>Last night the announcement of the constitutional affairs secretary met with scepticism from the law-and-order lobby and concern from Liberty, the civil rights campaign, that the move is merely \"election window dressing\" which might undermine defendants' rights. </p> <p>Though crime is falling in most categories, ministers are aware that it is an important election issue for many Labour voters whose lives are made miserable by vandalism and other anti-social conduct. </p> <p>Before he unveils the Asbo record on Thursday, the home secretary must tackle another voter-sensitive issue: today's EU decision with 24 fellow-home affairs ministers to confirm majority voting procedures on asylum and immigration - except where Britain exercises its right to \"opt-in\" to new procedures only when it wants to do so. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett faces a fresh barrage of rightwing tabloid hostility to today's \"surrender of national sovereignty\" (the deal was actually agreed at the Amsterdam summit in 1997) and yesterday moved to cover his back. </p> <p>He let it be known that he had just rung his Dutch counterpart, in the chair at today's session, to stress that he will not accept a common asylum system or anything else that weakens the UK's control of its own borders. </p> <p>\"He said these things should not be on the table,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>On the domestic front, Lord Falconer's changes to Asbo procedures include screening to hide witnesses from the defendant, the provision of separate facilities while waiting to testify in court, as well as the option of evidence by live link or in private and video-recorded testimony. </p> <p>There will also be a three-fold increase in the number of fast-track criminal courts in England and Wales - from 12 to 40 by early November. Full-time magistrates and prosecutors are put in place to deliver effective remedies quickly. </p> <p>David Davis, the shadow home secretary, was quick to criticise the proposal as a belated admission of neglect. \"While it is acceptable to enable witnesses to give evidence by video link, letting them give evidence from behind screens could be the start of a slippery slope. We also need to be told how the government intends to pay for all these extra courts, and whether other cases will have to be pushed aside,\" he said. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Association of Chief Police Officers yesterday signalled disappointment with 24-hour drinking which the new Licensing Act will permit. It comes at a time when violent crime, mostly drink-fuelled weekend violence, rose 11% last spring compared with the same period in 2003.</p>",
  "The militant group led by the Jordanian extremist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi signalled a fresh escalation of the Iraq insurgency crisis last night by claiming responsibility for the massacre of about 50 members of the national guard found dead on a remote road in eastern Iraq. <p>Al-Qaida in Iraq, formerly known as Tawhid and Jihad, said on an internet site it had carried out the murders. The group was responsible for the beheading of Ken Bigley and other western hostages as well as several suicide bombs. </p> <p>The massacre was the latest in a series of increasingly lethal attacks against Iraq's security forces, regarded as collaborators by insurgents, in an effort to affect troop strength and morale. Until now, they have mainly used suicide bombs, mortars and roadside devices. </p> <p>Iraqi officials said the men, who had just finished three weeks of training at the Kir Kush military base near the Iranian border, were ambushed on Saturday evening at a bogus checkpoint between Balad Ruz and Qazaniya in Diyala province, 50 miles northeast of Baghdad. </p> <p>A senior defence ministry official, Brigadier Salih Sarhan, said the soldiers, who were unarmed and wearing civilian clothing, \"were ordered from their buses by men in police uniforms, told to lie face down on the ground, and then shot in the back of the head\". </p> <p>There were conflicting reports of the number of dead but police said they had recovered 51 bodies. \"It is a savage act. They were all executed,\" said Colonel Adnan Abdul-Rahman, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Baghdad. </p> <p>General Walid al-Azzawi, commander of Diyala provincial police, said the bodies had been laid out in four rows. </p> <p>Some reports said the attackers had first fired rocket propelled grenades at the three minibuses in which the soldiers were travelling back to their homes in southern Iraq. </p> <p>Brig Sarhan said three civilian drivers had been killed. Two of the minibuses had been burned and one stolen by the attackers. </p> <p>A statement posted online in the name of al-Qaida in Iraq, which changed its name last week after pledging allegiance to Osama bin Laden, said: \"God enabled the Mujahideen to kill all of them and seize two cars and money.\" It was not possible to authenticate the claim yesterday but if true it could mark a new phase of tactics by the group and demonstrate its ability to strike across the Sunni triangle. </p> <p>Equally disturbing for Iraqi authorities is the thought that Mr Zarqawi's followers have successfully infiltrated the country's new security force. </p> <p>Brig Sarhan said the massacre appeared to have been well planned. He said it remained unclear why the soldiers were not accompanied by an armed escort, and how the attackers appeared to have gained precise information about their movements. </p> <p>The deputy governor of Diyala province, Aqil al-Adili, said either incompetence or collusion was to blame: \"There must have been an informant. How come they knew they were unarmed and they knew about the time and the way these men were travelling?\" </p> <p>Speaking on al-Sharqiya television, monitored by the BBC, the Iraqi defence minister, Hazim al-Shaalan, said: \"Once we identify and arrest the perpetrators, we will take tough measures against them. God willing ... they will receive capital punishment.\" </p> <p>The deaths followed a suicide bomb attack on Iraqi security forces north and west of Baghdad on Friday, in which at least 22 Iraqi policemen and national guardsmen died. </p> <p>In three separate incidents on Saturday, insurgents hit Iraq army and national guard forces on patrol in and around the central city of Samarra, lightly wounding two Iraqi soldiers, the US military said. </p> <p>The Ansar al-Sunnah army, another militant group, yester-day claimed the killing of Taha Ahmed, a senior police officer in the Kurdish city of Irbil. </p> <p>A US diplomat was also killed in his sleep by \"indirect fire\" at Baghdad airport yesterday. An embassy official said Edward Seitz was an agent with the state department's bureau of diplomatic security. </p> <p>Mr Seitz is thought to be the first diplomat killed in Iraq since the invasion. More than 1,000 US servicemen have died during the conflict. </p> <p>Insurgent attacks have increased by 25% since the start of Ramadan last weekend. </p> <p>News of the massacre of national guardsmen came as US forces continued the almost daily series of air strikes against suspected terrorist safe houses, meeting places and weapons stores in Falluja, west of Baghdad, where militants loyal to Mr Zarqawi are said to be based. </p> <p>Meanwhile, 500 soldiers of the Black Watch held a parade and prayer service in Basra, in preparation for their posting to an area south of Baghdad. The battalion and 100 members of the Queen's Dragoon Guard, 50 Royal Marines and around 200 support staff will be patrolling Mahmudiya, Iskandariya and Latifiya, where law has broken down and kidnapping is rife.</p>",
  "Country types like to have a laugh at urbanites who move to the countryside and complain about the smell and noise - clanging church bells, power-mooing cows, roary tractors. But the dominant noise you hear in the English countryside is not, and never has been, any of these. It is the steady, unwavering, nerve-shredding noise of bleating. Not the relatively relaxing, chilled-out bleat of sheep, but the incessant, much harder to ignore bleat of that never-knowingly-satisfied figure, the English Countryman. <p>Of the several clever things done by the Countryside Alliance, the most astute was the way in which it harnessed this general sense of grievance for its single issue. Foxhunting is not a popular cause anywhere in the UK, and it isn't much more popular in the countryside, where class differences are at least as sharp, and as full of resentment, as they are in town. But one thing almost everyone in the country has, in addition to their specific grievances - phone masts, bypasses, closing post-offices - is a vivid feeling of being generally hard done by. The Countryside Alliance has drawn on that hard-done-by-ness with great skill. </p> <p>Outsiders, however, find the bleating hard to understand. If you, like me, are one of the 71.5% of Britons who lives in an urban environment, then you may find yourself wondering exactly what it is that countrysiders are moaning about. After all, one of the most robust indicators of how satisfactory a place is to live is whether or not people want to go and live there. In France, for instance, rural life is so quiet and so boring that there has been, for generations, a consistent pattern of internal migration from the country to the town. This is the general pattern across the developed world: people go to live in cities because they have better lives there. Not in Britain, though. For 2002, the last year in which there were accurate figures, a net 115,400 people moved out of urban environments into the countryside. In other words, every year a city slightly bigger then Exeter disappears, and reappears wearing green wellies and complaining about the bypass. This has been going on for a decade and a half. Why? Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that people in the countryside have a relatively higher standard of living, better health care, better schools, and live longer. So what's with all this complaining? </p> <p>My own feelings about the English countryside were shaped by the contrast between them and the Far East, where I grew up. We moved to rural Norfolk from Hong Kong, which at that point was the most crowded city in the world. Compared to that, Norfolk was a paradise of space and light and fresh air. Our house was near the Broads, and I would go out in a canoe to explore the network of dykes and rivers almost every day. There was a kingfisher who lived near where I hid the canoe, and the electric-blue shock of his underbelly, so startling among the greens and greys of the reeds, was, every time I saw it, the high point of my day. As a city boy, I had not known that any natural phenomenon could be the high point of a day. A pair of bitterns lived in the marsh, and during the spring you could hear the male's astonishing foghorn boom from, literally, miles away. I thought about taking up birdwatching, but gave up after one afternoon, during which I counted 47 house sparrows. </p> <p>The most exotic of the local fauna was the coypu. A coypu is a 2ft-long \u00fcber-rat with-and this is the clincher - red-orange teeth. They are a rodent cross between Arnold Schwarzennegger and Dracula. At night they used to break in to our vegetable patch (which we had fenced to keep them out) and make terrifying howling sounds, a cross between cats in a sack and hungry human babies. Cool! That was part of the magic of Norfolk, that it had real wild nature in it. Hong Kong was a place of convulsive change, where familiar landmarks would disappear overnight; rural Norfolk seemed calm, stable, and permanent. </p> <p>I was dead wrong about all that. Twenty-plus years later, Britain's coypus are extinct: they were exterminated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food because of the damage they did to riverbanks. Bitterns are down to their last 50-odd breeding pairs; I spoke to a birdwatcher who said he hadn't heard one in 10 years. Last week, house sparrows were put on the endangered species list; their population has declined by 62% in 25 years, and nobody knows why. The fact that the Broads look more or less the same disguises marked and sudden ecological changes. </p> <p>What I didn't know was the the Broads were not, and never had been, a wild place. Their very existence is the legacy of human actions, from medieval peat diggings. That is typical of the British countryside. There is no nature left in this country. Nothing here is untouched: since the great bronze-age deforestation, man has made his mark everywhere in these islands. Even our greatest, most beautiful landscapes, the Lake District or the Yorkshire Dales, are man-made, created by deforestation and agriculture. (In fact, part of the beauty of England's great landscapes, in the north or in the west, is their human scale, their intimacy: we have no Alps here, let alone any Grand Canyons. Our landscapes don't make us feel small.) Everything in Britain is the product of a choice. So the first thing we have to do when thinking about the countryside is accept that there is no nature here, only culture: only things that we have made and chosen. The way our countryside looks, and the ways we live in it, are products of our choices, and we must let go of any fantasies about nature and timelessness and stasis. We must choose the countryside we want. We have to ask, what is the countryside for? </p> <p>Some of this choosing is simple - not always easy to execute, but simple. We want our beautiful \"nature\" spots kept the way they are, so we turn them into national parks. Running the national parks is not easy. There are 12 million visits a year to the Lake District alone; this wild, natural place needs a lot of managing if it is going to stay that way. But at least we can agree on that. We want our agreed beautiful places to stay as beautiful as possible, and that means we have to treat them as if they were in themselves a finite resource. </p> <p>That, unfortunately, is where the simple part of the choosing ends. For the rest, we have to face a paradox about the countryside, which is that there is a stark division between the land and the people who live on it. Of the 45 million habitable acres in Britain, 4 million is urban plot, and 41 million is agricultural land. But that agricultural land employs only 2% of the working population. So whom do you talk to when you want to talk about the countryside? If you want to talk about the 90% of our countryside which is given over to farmland, you have to talk to a farmer. But you have to bear in mind that farmers, while they represent the overwhelming majority of the land surface of our country, represent an almost invisible minority of the people who live here. </p> <p>They are increasingly aware of it, too. \"When I was growing up I thought people liked farmers,\" Steve Wilson, an arable farmer from mid-Norfolk, told me. \"My dad was a farmer, and, you know, there was this sense that people thought of farmers as a good thing. But over the last years that seems to have changed. You started hearing that farmers complained all the time, and that we get all these subsidies, and so on. And the coverage is all different now, it's hostile.\" Wilson produces more than his father did out of the large flat fields of their property. He is clearly prosperous, but, equally clearly, is stressed. He looks like a red-faced outdoors type, but when he talks about his work it is like hearing someone in a high-pressured City job. \"You have this fantasy of being allowed to just get on with it. But that's not what it's like at all.\" </p> <p>I asked around about this. It seems to be true: people who aren't directly involved in agriculture and old-type country life don't seem to have much love of people who are. Class politics exist in the country at least as much as in town. Some of this is to do with old ways versus new ways, or, more accurately, old money versus new. A man in a cravat, whispering, told me about pheasant shoots where \"nooves\" (his word) \"and rock stars\" kill a thousand birds in a day, so many that some of them are ploughed under rather than sold. \"I think it's wicked,\" said my informant. (In the countryside, posh people still use the word \"wicked\" to mean \"wicked\".) </p> <p>I told Wilson that the night before I spoke to him, I had been staying at a local pub, with comfy bedrooms and the disconcertingly good - and not cheap - food you increasingly find in England's pubs. The conversation was about a local farmer who was digging up a field and kept causing power cuts. \"You can tell he feels guilty,\" one of the locals said, \"because he stops and chats to people in the village. Not that he'd ever admit it.\" </p> <p>Wilson shrugged. \"Time was when farmers were the local community. Now, we're not.\" He waved around him at his farm office, which had the endemic scruffiness of farm back rooms. A VAT registration certificate was pinned to the wall next to a FHM Honeyz poster. \"We think of this as the main purpose of the countryside, but in lots of ways now it's not. We're more cut off.\" He told me that he couldn't go and drink in the pubs he liked as a young man because it is used by former farm-workers whom he had made redundant. </p> <p>So the answer to our question about \"what is the countryside for\", is, in practise, \"growing food\". But this is not what most of the people who live in the countryside do. Mark Miller, a schoolfriend of mine who moved back to Norfolk from a job in the City, took me on a drive round the village where he grew up. When I asked him why he had moved back, and cut his salary by more than 50%, he said, without missing a beat, \"quality of life\". </p> <p>\"But everyone who lives in the country seems to complain all the time\"' I said. He shrugged. \"Of course they do. People feel culturally invisible, they feel no one cares about them and no one knows anything about their lives. They feel modern Britain sees them as irrelevant. That's what they're really complaining about. But in straight quality of life terms, there's no question you're better off in the country.\" </p> <p>\"Most of the land around here is now consolidated in the hands of a single farmer,\" he went on. \"Out of a village population of a few hundred, only about 10 work on the land, and most of them work for other farmers. Mostly people are commuters who live in Norwich. One or two work from home.\" He listed the professions: some were in the service industry cutting hair or cleaning houses or teaching pilates. \"There's a self-employed businessman or two. There's a bloke who made a bomb trading shares online and then lost it in the tech crash. There's a village idiot and a village wife-beater and a couple who are supposed to be swingers. All the usual stuff.\" The village still has a shop and a primary school. One thing which there isn't locally is any foxhunting. There are no hunts near by and even if there were: \"The farmer wouldn't allow it.\" </p> <p>Who represents these people? What single body speaks for them? Well, nobody, really. They live in a rural setting, but, like most people who live in rural settings in Britain, their lives are economically tied to town. An increasing number of them live on the estates like the new one which had suddenly appeared on the way out to our old home from Norwich. This was a road I had taken perhaps a thousand times, in car and on foot, on bike and motorbike, drunk and sober, happy and sad, in every stage of teenage love and teenage dumpedness, and once walking my bike home on its back wheel seven miles at two in the morning because someone had nicked the front one. Turning off down the road on this visit, though, I had to stop because it no longer existed. A brand new, hideous housing estate was built right in the way. Large signs invited me to inspect a display house. If I hurried and bought a small one, I might have change from \u00a3200,000. The quiet road-to-nowhere to our village now involved me doubling back and taking a detour down a roaring dual carriageway. </p> <p>These semi-country estates are going to be more and more of a factor in country life. You can't help but wonder what they're going to be like to live on. Simon Pinker, now a hard-living London adman hitting 40, grew up on one, \"near Windsor if you wanted to sound like a nob, or in Bracknell if you were trying to sound tough\". He says that \"the main feeling you have, especially a teenager, is that life is happening to someone else\". Life in these places - which are exurban, really, to do with the spread of city into the country - is, according to him, dull. Once he had left to go to college, Pinker never lived at home again. \"They're great for young people, and great for old people, and incredibly boring for everybody in the middle. And it is essential that you drive, or have access to a car. On my estate, if you didn't pass your driving test at your first attempt, everybody assumed you were homosexual.\" </p> <p>These estates are changing the British countryside. Norfolk - sleepy, Alan Partridgesque Norfolk, famously preserved by the fact that it isn't on the way to anywhere - has 72,600 new houses in John Prescott's brilliant masterplan to cover the whole of south and eastern England with Barratt show-homes. That is a new city the size of Norwich, already the biggest city in the county by far. This won't involve convulsive, revolutionary change. Nothing dramatic will happen. It's just that life will be, in dozens of small ways, slightly worse: more people, more traffic, more noise, more pollution, more queuing, more time spent at the check-out, longer waiting times at the doctor and the den tist and the hospital, a tighter blast-area of selection by postcode around the good schools, and a general sense that the reasons for wanting to live in the countryside in the first place are gradually and irrevocably fading away. </p> <p>A funny thing happens when people talk about this, though. You listen to all the specifics, nodding politely, and - if you live in an urban environment - with part of your head thinking that this doesn't sound too bad, really. Then about half the time the person you are talking to will use the word \"community\". They will say, \"the community is going\", or there is \"less sense of community\", or they \"miss the feeling of community\". </p> <p>This is the point at which people lose me. I know that community is supposed to be a good thing and that we are all supposed to live in one. It's just that it seems to me to be a fact of modern countryside life that community, in this hearth-hallowed, warm-glow sense, doesn't exist. Far more than the town, the countryside is an atomised, fragmented place. I don't know whether the underlying factors in this are economic (the principal one being perhaps that countrysiders go somewhere else to earn their living, then return to their little boxes to live privately) or psychological (in that people who move to the country are doing so at some level to get away from other people). But I have lived in quite a few places in quite a few different countries, and I have never lived anywhere as essentially unfriendly, broken-up, atomised and fragmented as the English countryside. </p> <p>That was, in the end, the reason we left. Our house had a few acres of marsh land - unusable but beautiful - attached. One day I took my father out in my canoe and we saw that a stretch of trees, mainly beautiful low-hanging willows, had been cut down. It had obviously happened very recently. We investigated and found out that, with nods and winks, a group of locals had agreed to cut down our trees, in order to allow access for sailing boats down a side-creek. Nobody asked my father, and the feeling that the same people who would smile and nod and make small-talk about the weather would do this behind his back caused him to feel he couldn't live in that place any more. He realised that after 11 years, he was still an outsider; that the locals still did not trust him. He felt a deep, bitter, sense of personal betrayal. It gave him an intense feeling of insecurity. By my next holiday from university, three months later, he had sold the house and moved into Norwich. Three months after that he died of a heart attack. The business with the trees did not cause that, but it certainly did not help. </p> <p>It seems to me that people in the English countryside are trapped between the immovable conservatism of our patterns of land use, and the irresistible changes brought by population pressure. You can, on reflection, see why they are prone to complaint. But when they mourn the loss of a sense of community, they are asking us to mourn something which died a long time ago if, indeed, it ever existed. </p> <p>And there is another factor to consider when listening to the countryside blues. Although the countryside I visited had changed, the place which had looked like it had changed the most, and most for the worst, was Norwich. \"This used to be a charming city,\" Miller told me. \"You see that slogan on the sign as you're driving in: Norwich, a Fine City\". It makes you laugh because it's so Alan Partridge but the thing is it used to be true. For one thing Norwich is just the right size. It was always coming top in quality-of-life rankings for the best place to live in the UK. Now, though, it's all changed. The shoe factory closed, the chocolate factory closed. There are these hideous developments everywhere. And then the main thing is these pissed-up groups coming into the city in the evenings. It turns the city centre into a no-go area.\" </p> <p>All this, of course, is another story, and not strictly relevant to what has happened in the countryside. But it is worth bearing this in mind, the next time you hear a countrydweller having a bleat. \"Life in the countryside might have got worse,\" Miller told me, \"but life in the centre of Britain's cities has got worse quicker. That's why we choose to live in the country. We're not thick.\"</p>",
  "<p>About 50 leading German business executives will this week draw up plans for radical changes to the system of co-determination which gives workers and unions seats in boardrooms. For decades the system has been seen as a boon for Europe's biggest economy but is now derided by Michael Rogowski, president of the Confederation of German Industry, as \"an error of history\". Mitbestimmung is increasingly seen as a baneful influence, preventing the modernisation of a floundering economy, discouraging foreign investors, cementing a rigid labour market and forcing a flight of capital.</p> <p>But the system, introduced in the British zone of occupation after the war before going nationwide in 1976, has found staunch defenders in Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and J\u00fcrgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler chief executive, as well as the unions.</p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der said last week he had always supported co-determination and that would remain the case. \"It has strengthened, not weakened, Germany,\" he said, echoing the words of his economics minister, Wolfgang Clement.</p> <p>Mr Schrempp told Stern magazine he had \"very good experiences, all things considered\" with the system, dealing over the past 20 years with very \"competent\" labour representatives who were closely bound up with the firm and its success. \"In our case it works extraordinarily well.\" Privately, British executives serving on German boards disagree.</p> <p>The British originally imposed co-determination in the coal and steel industries, the industrial muscle behind Hitler's military power, in an effort to prevent the rebirth of Nazi-style aggression. Giving workers equal places in the board room with capital would act as a brake on over-ambitious expansion.</p> <p>The nationwide system imposed by Willy Brandt's Social Democrat government gave workers and union representatives up to 10 seats on 20-strong supervisory boards which are designed to oversee the executive board in the development of company policy and strategy - including investment, rationalisation and closures. The chairman, normally representing investors, has the casting vote in the event of a deadlock.</p> <p>Co-determination, its proponents say, has enabled German companies to manage change in an exemplary fashion through consensus. But critics argue that companies such as Opel, the carmaker shedding 10,000 jobs, and Karstadt, the retailer axing 5,500 posts, have been plunged into financial crisis because the supervisory board postponed radical surgery or enjoyed so cosy a relationship with the executive board that nothing ever happened.</p> <p>Now Mr Rogowski and officials in the German Federation of Employers in effect want to hand all decision-making powers to the executive board. Under the revised system being drawn up by their joint working group, all companies would be empowered to renegotiate co-determination arrangements.</p> <p>If the \"social partners\" fail to agree, a draft paper leaked to Der Spiegel last week says that only a third, rather than a half, of all supervisory board seats would be reserved for worker representatives. In Anglo-Saxon-style firms with a single board, the worker representatives would be confined to a watered-down consultative council. In the coal and steel industries, co-determination would cease altogether.</p> <p>Worker representatives, often including union leaders active in a particular sector such as transport or chemicals, are delegated but Mr Rogowski's plans would force a ballot of the entire workforce.</p> <p>Dennis Snower, head of Kiel's Institute for the World Economy, told a reporter from the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung last week that the system must be adapted to meet modern demands for entrepreneurial flexibility, especially among foreign investors.</p> <p>The most telling business argument for change is that co-determination is an obstacle to cross-border mergers or, as in the case of Hoechst and Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc (now Aventis), forces the transfer of the company headquarters outside Germany.</p> <p>But EU company law reforms, in the making for 30 years, will enable transnational firms to become European plcs (or AGs in Germany), with little or no co-determination. So far, few British companies seem attracted by the idea, let alone by Mitbestimmung; their German rivals are much more interested.</p>",
  "Hanging chads troubled George Bush in the 2000 election in Florida, while Hamid Karzai, the now nearly official winner of Afghanistan's presidential poll, faced difficulties with imperfect indelible ink that was feared could mean multiple voting. Happily for Mr Karzai - and for his enthusiastic backer in the White House - the problem has been resolved and the Afghan result seems all but certain. Mr Karzai's rival, the ethnic Tajik Yunus Qanuni, conceded defeat yesterday, guaranteeing the Pashtun favourite a simple majority large enough to avoid a destabilising second ballot. The stage is thus set for a five-year term for a man whose dignity and self-assurance in tackling the horrendous problems of his war-ravaged land has won him plaudits across the world. <p>Overall, Afghanistan had a remarkably free election for a vast country with poor communications where much of the electorate is illiterate and hundreds of donkeys were needed to reach remote polling stations. How fair it was remains an open question, with reports of official blunders and some ballot-stuffing and multiple voting. Intimidation may have been far more widespread than has been reported by the few foreign observers on hand. And when 15 presidential candidates withdrew in protest because of the row over the non-indelible ink - used to make thumbprints on ballot papers - they were quickly persuaded to change their minds by the US ambassador, who is known as \"the viceroy\". Afghanistan's speedy transition to democracy matters very much to Mr Bush - especially because of the deepening mayhem in Iraq. Many believe the US has pushed too far, too fast, for its own selfish reasons. But that does not mean that significant progress, recognised by Afghans choosing their leader for the first time ever, should be underestimated.</p> <p>Thankfully, the poll also took place without the widespread violence that had been feared - though a rare suicide bomb attack in central Kabul yesterday claimed the lives of an American woman and an Afghan girl. Until now, security forces have been relatively successful in subduing the Taliban threat and have reduced militants to launching sporadic rocket attacks and roadside bombs in the outlying southern provinces where the insurgency is strongest. Still, though, Mr Karzai had to spend much of the election campaign holed up in his secure compound in Kabul after a missile attack on his helicopter. Such dangers will not disappear magically overnight.</p> <p>Security, in fact, is by far the biggest single problem facing the country - just as it is in Iraq - largely because the US and its allies, and Mr Karzai's interim government, have failed to disarm the powerful warlords. Nato, whose members agreed on Afghanistan while splitting over Iraq, has also failed dismally to meet its own pledges and move its troops in significant numbers to the west and south and help extend the reach of central government. The Americans, still fighting alone, will have to do more than hunt Taliban and al-Qaida remnants on the mountainous border with Pakistan.</p> <p>Mr Karzai, who is widely seen as Washington's man, has probably won a strong enough mandate to allow him to improve his credentials as leader to all of Afghanistan's ethnic groups, which picked their candidates backed by regional militias, and in some cases drug money, for the top job in Kabul. But he will need to achieve a huge amount and avoid too many compromises in choosing his cabinet and provincial governors - especially shunning men who control private armies - if the parliamentary elections scheduled for next spring are to succeed. His victory should act as a spur to those foreign governments that have radiated goodwill towards this tragic country but have done too little to translate it into effective action.</p>",
  "<p><strong>God Bless America: With God On Our Side</strong></p> <p>Channel 4, Saturday, 7.20pm</p> <p>Jokes from politicians are generally ghostwritten and calculated to increase their appeal, but one quip attributed to the first President Bush has the distinction of being both original and electorally suicidal. Entering a prayer breakfast of Republican fundamentalist Christians, George HW Bush is supposed to have said: \"I'm the only person in this room that's only been born once.\" </p> <p>This religious flippancy may have cost Bush snr his presidency and - as a compelling documentary screened on the eve of the US election makes clear - the son of the father has been careful not to make the same mistake in his dealings with those who believe in the Son of the Father. Channel 4's God Bless America: With God On Our Side combines an examination of the beliefs of George W Bush with a study of the influence of evangelical Christians on American politics. </p> <p>The first half of Calvin Skaggs's and David Van Taylor's documentary establishes the historical context: born-again Christians in America helped to the Presidency a succession of men who they came to regard as false prophets. The Reverend Billy Graham endorsed Richard Nixon, a professing Baptist who became the only President to have to watch, half-way through his term, a successor swearing on the Bible. </p> <p>Jimmy Carter talked the talk - there's hilarious archive from 1976 of NBC anchor John Chancellor nervously explaining the previously unheard term \"born again\" - but, once elected, passed an equal rights amendment that clashed with the evangelicals' view of the sacred icon of the home-baking mom. Reagan next seemed to be their saviour - telling a convention of Bible-belters that his favourite book was the Good Book - but then appointed a pro-choice woman, Sandra Day O'Connor, to the Supreme Court. </p> <p>Reagan was followed by the man who had only been born once. The film fascinatingly explains how, in 1988, it was the son who convinced American Christians that his father believed in the Father. George W Bush - who had recently stopped drinking and come to God at the Holiday Inn in Midland, Texas - operated as spiritual advisor to a campaign bewildered by the power of the Christian vote (a TV evangelist, Rev Pat Robertson, had run well against the then vice president Bush in the primaries). </p> <p>The first President Bush proved another disappointment to the God-lobby - inviting gays and lesbians to the White House - but the Christians finally found their political salvation in the son. The film compellingly shows that George W Bush represents to Christian Americans an embodiment of the parable of the prodigal son. Elements of his biography that might have been thought problematic to the Moral Majority - the years of getting wrecked in Texas - in fact became assets because the candidate was willing to present himself as a victor over sin. </p> <p>The religiosity of American politics tends to be a problem for British journalism because we find it hard to believe that they really believe it. Avoiding mockery - approaching the President's theology as solemnly and neutrally as if it were his economic policy - this outstanding documentary uses little-seen archive - including Dubya praying on an evangelical television breakfast show - to demonstrate how fundamental Christianity is to Bush and why having been born twice represents his best chance of being elected twice. </p> <p><strong> The luxury of choice</strong></p> <p>Outside of the abortion debate in America, the word \"choice\" has only been as bitterly contested in the history of television. The c-word was used to justify first the satellite and cable revolution and now digital expansion. </p> <p>But, in recent years, many viewers and critics have argued that technological plenty has brought artistic famine: that as increased competition for viewers has forced channels to concentrate on a few reliably populist genres - soap, makeover, reality TV, detective - the choice of programmes has diminished even as the number of buttons on the remote control has increased. </p> <p>So, at a watershed moment for broadcasting - following the regulator Ofcom's report on the future of public service broadcasting and an independent survey of the BBC's digital channels - it seemed a useful exercise to assess how much choice a viewer has at a single junction of the schedules. I chose the middle of the evening in the middle of week: traditionally strong slots throughout television history. </p> <p>At 9pm this Wednesday, the viewer with only terrestrial equipment can select from: the fifth part of Titchmarsh's British Isles: A Natural History (BBC1); the second part of Adam Curtis's essay on terrorism, The Power of Nightmares (BBC2); the terrestrial premiere of James Bond in Die Another Day (ITV1); the final episode of the continental downshift series Grand Designs (Channel 4) and a repeat screening of Kevin Costner in The Bodyguard (Five). </p> <p>This represents a reasonable choice in that only one genre is repeated (American movies), although few viewers would feel a terrible dilemma: it's hard to imagine anyone being desperate to watch both the idea-free Titchmarsh doc and the thesis-packed Curtis one. </p> <p>For those with digital and/or satellite, the selection becomes more complex, bringing in, among dozens of options, the possibility at 9pm of a three-and-a-half hour Breast Cancer Special (BBC3); a German drama about the Mann brothers (BBC3); the reality game-show Holiday Showdown (ITV2); the Australian detective series Murder Cell (Plus); and Virtual History: The Plot to Kill Hitler (Discovery). </p> <p>Although my choice of time-slot was randomly selected, this particular Wednesday schedule benefitted from two pieces of luck: it's a rare winter midweek evening without European football and the BBC is on best behaviour ahead of charter renewal. Yet, even so, the available range of viewing is far greater than (examination of old copies of Radio Times suggests) it was five, 10 and 20 years ago. While there is considerable doubt about how this plethora of networks will sustain viewers and income in the future, the old American complaint - 200 channels and nothing on - doesn't yet apply to fledging British multichannel television.</p>",
  "<p>Love across the divide is one of the great dramatic staples. In his play <strong>Himmler's Boy</strong> (Radio 3, Sunday), Adam Thorpe took one step back from this thorny, reliably gripping subject to look at love emerging, tentatively and unpredictably, as a new divide begins to take shape. </p> <p>Beginning in Vienna in 1931, the play shadows idealistic German art student Klaus Bessel as he meets and falls for spiky, feisty Anya Goldberger, a young Jewish woman from Krakow. Despite herself, she warms to him and his excitable proclamations (\"smash down the bourgeois walls that lock us all into this vulgarity and baseness that hide the sublime beauty and spirit of the world!\" is a typical chat-up line). They spend two intense days together, part, and gradually lose touch. </p> <p>By 1941, Bessel is a member of a special SS unit responsible for plundering occupied territories such as Poland of its priceless art collections. He requests a post in Krakow and sets about finding Anya. When he does, he stumbles over explaining himself turning up in an SS uniform. \"Nothing to do with the...\" he says, struggling for words and realising none are quite up to the job. \"[It's] a completely different department.\" Anya, still stingingly sharp, wants no help from him, but knows she has to take it. \"It's not fair is it?\" she rails, \"that I have to be grateful to a monster.\" </p> <p>What Thorpe managed so impressively was to see this fledgling relationship through a filter of some of history's darkest days, but to do so with a coolness and lightness of touch that staved off melodramatic and mawkish moments. Every scene felt quietly real, for all the rush of social change and infinite cruelty just beyond it. </p> <p>The rush and cruelty of the sea was much in evidence in <strong>Law of the Arctic</strong> (Radio 4, Friday), Clive Anderson's travelogue through the legal system in Greenland. Anderson is a cute guide, peppering the facts with plenty of silly asides, gleefully delivered. \"So,\" he says, before beginning a journey to a town 750 miles north of the arctic circle, \"the only way to go was by dog-sled.\" Comic pause. \"Or aeroplane.\" Cue the engine noise of a small aircraft. </p> <p>It wasn't all guffaws. In the northerly settlement, where it's dark for four months of the year and the sea remains frozen for 10, a police officer reads from a log-book containing details of the 31 crimes in the town so far this year. The first is drink-driving. Then it's \"sort of rape\", followed by \"sort of rape\" again, and then \"rape\". Anderson queried this pattern. \"Oh, it's not real rape,\" the officer suggested breezily, \"like in big cities. Here, you are family and friends.\" Even Anderson didn't have a quip just then.</p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Miller's Brief History of Disbelief<br> 9.30pm, BBC4</p> <p>Miller's series on atheism arrives at the working-class revolution in thought and belief that came at the beginning of the 19th century and contributed largely to the French Revolution. Plenty of European upper-class thinkers had rejected Christianity previously, but had been aware that to undermine religious thought with the masses would be politically disastrous.

  "The interim leader Hamid Karzai coasted towards victory in Afghanistan's presidential election yesterday when his share of the vote passed the 50% mark. <p>With 94% of the vote counted he had 4.2m of the estimated 8.2m ballots cast: enough to avoid a run-off against his nearest rival Yunus Qanooni, who trailed a distant second with 1.2m votes. </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Qanooni conceded defeat last night, according to Reuters, but official confirmation of Mr Karzai's victory was frozen pending the outcome of an investigation into alleged polling irregularities. </p> <p>The inquiry, now confined to 12 disputed ballot boxes, is unlikely to affect the final result. </p> <p>\"The result looks mathematically certain, but we can't say anything official yet,\" Reginald Austin, chief technical adviser to the joint UN-Afghan election body, said. </p> <p>Although marred by blunders and fraud allegations, the election, held on October 9, was hailed as a watershed after a quarter of a century of violent chaos. </p> <p>Millions of mostly illiterate Afghans braved threats of violence or harsh weather to cast their first vote. </p> <p>But the mood of relief was dampened on Saturday by a Taliban suicide bombing on a busy Kabul street which killed two civilians and injured three peacekeepers. </p> <p>The bomber, disguised as a beggar, struck on Chicken Street, which is lined with rug and antique shops, apparently aiming at a jeep of soldiers from the Nato-led Isaf peacekeeping mission. </p> <p>A 23-year-old American translator and an 11-year-old Afghan girl were killed. Three Icelandic soldiers, one seriously injured, were taken to hospital. The attack dented the hope that the Taliban's failure to disrupt the poll marked a decline in the insurgency. </p> <p>Security analysts said the amateurish nature of the attack - the bomber managed to explode only three of the six grenades attached to him - showed that the fundamentalists remained a weakened force. </p> <p>The vote count, which began 12 days ago, is expected to end today when the last ballots from Pakistan and a few remote provinces are tallied. </p> <p>If confirmed as victor, Mr Karzai will have a five-year mandate to help him shake off the jibe that he is a mere puppet of his American supporters. </p> <p>An ethnic Pashtun, he was appointed interim president after the US-led invasion deposed the Taliban regime in late 2001. </p> <p>The successful poll will also reverberate in the US, where President George Bush is portraying Afghanistan in his re- election campaign as a foreign policy success. </p> <p>But Afghanistan's transition to democracy remains fragile and incomplete. The voting patterns suggest that it remains divided by the ethnic hostilities which have fed much of the recent conflict. </p> <p>Mr Qanooni relied heavily on his fellow Tajik for votes. Similarly, the third and fourth placed candidates, the warlords Abdul Rashid Dostum and Mohammed Mohaqeq, relied on their Uzbek and Hazara constituencies. </p> <p>So far Mr Karzai has employed a policy of appeasement towards the warlords, who control much of the country outside Kabul. Many voters now expect him to adopt a more forceful approach. </p> <p>The other tasks facing him include disarming an estimated 40,000 gunmen, preparing for next April's parliamentary elections, and combating the increasingly pervasive influence of drug money. </p> <p>Afghanistan is expected to record a bumper opium harvest this year, and officials ranging from regional governors to police chiefs are expected to benefit. Allegations against one of Mr Karzai's relatives, rumoured to be a big heroin smuggler, are coursing through Kabul's diplomatic circles. If they are proved, Mr Karzai could be damaged.</p>",
  "<p>When a seasoned gambler wins at the tables, not a flicker of pleasure crosses his face. His addiction turns the game into a joyless routine. He continues simply because he must continue.</p> <p>This is what Liam Brennan's Iago is like. In his plot to undermine Othello, the boss he professes to hate, he has luck on his side. The stakes are lethally high, but even when scoring jackpot after jackpot, he never cracks a smile. For him, the action has become more important than the motivation: he's doing it because he's doing it.</p> <p>What makes Brennan all the more chilling is the way he plays every line with absolute conviction. You can't blame Wil Johnson's Othello for being taken in by him, when even we have to remind ourselves he's lying through his teeth. He gives us no knowing winks and makes no special pleading. He is terrifying in his straight-talking immorality.</p> <p>Johnson, meanwhile, is the upright soldier, a figure of disciplined strength who becomes physically scary when he loses control. First it is just his left arm that shakes in rhythmical fury, but by the time he confronts Clare Yuille's delicate but determined Desdemona, he has unleashed his formidable might. It's significant that in a last effort to regain his composure, he dresses in full military colours before he kills her.</p> <p>Francis O'Connor's sunny, sandy, Cypriot location, with its tall columns stretching high into the ceiling, places the action in a recognisable army world, even if the 1930s setting adds little. But the great power of Mark Thomson's lucidly spoken production is in its emotional directness. Strong performances across the cast help expose the web of Iago's injuries in all their painfulness, moving us with the cruel force of fate.

  "<p>Daffodils, cod, Christmas trees and the Highlands' ski resorts could have become victims of global warming by 2050 according to an energy-efficiency report today. Warmer weather will, instead, introduce vineyards to Scotland, stingrays and more types of sharks in our coastal waters as well as termites, scorpions and mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus and dengue fever, the study - Forecasting the Future - says. </p> <p>Published by the Energy Saving Trust, the body established by the government following the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the document details the likely effect of climate change on Britain if nothing is done to cut emissions of greenhouse gases or reduce energy use. </p> <p>As much as \u00a3200bn-worth of property and infrastructure including 2m homes could be at risk from flooding and coastal erosion by the middle of the century, the projection suggests. The cost of buildings subsidence, exacerbated by weather extremes, could top \u00a3600m a year and storm damage could add another \u00a3800m to annual insurance claims. </p> <p>\"Flooding is a potential problem as winter rains grow heavier and sea levels rise,\" says the report, produced in conjunction with the UK Climate Impact Programme. \"Investment will be needed to protect London and other key places from flooding as well as vulnerable installations such as nuclear power stations. </p> <p>\"Within 50 years parts of East Anglia will have to be heavily defended against rising seas. Some land could be returned to the sea in more managed retreats.\" One such controlled breach of flood defences was carried out on Humberside last year. </p> <p>Average temperatures are expected to be between 1C and 4.5C higher by the end of the century, when golf courses will become increasingly expensive to maintain due to long hot summers. </p> <p>The report is being released as part of Energy Efficiency Week and comes amid a flurry of climate change predictions and warnings that not enough is being done to save energy or provide alternative sources from non-fossil fuel. Under the Kyoto protocol and other EU agreements, the UK must, by 2010, reduce its emissions of six major greenhouse gases by 12.5% compared with levels in 1990. The government has promised to reduce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions by 20% by the end of this decade and by 60% by 2050. </p> <p>The trust's projections are based on the presumption that such demanding targets cannot be met. Little can be done to halt global warming over the next 30-40 years because of the vast amount of such gases already released by burning fossil fuels, the trust believes. But there is a chance to mitigate the worst impacts of global warming beyond that date. </p> <p>Last week the WWF (formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature) criticised the government for underestimating by 30% the true level of carbon dioxide emissions for which Britain is responsible. </p> <p>\"The prime minister's strong words on climate change in the UK are still being undermined by failure to control CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions,\" said the organisation's director of campaigns, Andrew Lee. </p> <p>\"Emissions at home are rising under Labour. In addition the economy is driving up emissions around the world.\" Food, manufactured goods and raw materials imported from abroad generate large CO<sub>2</sub> emissions abroad, the WWF says, for which UK consumers are responsible. </p> <p>This week Barbara Young, chief executive of the Environment Agency, will reinforce the message that individual consumers must make important choices. Consumption and energy use are rocketing, she will tell a conference in Birmingham. The number of electrical devices used by households in England and Wales is, for example, due to double this decade. The agency's estimate of the damage likely to be caused by flooding in 2080, if no action is taken to control global warming, is \u00a326bn a year. Emissions of greenhouse gases will need to be cut by 75% in 2050 to prevent such dangers, she suggests. More than a quarter of all carbon emissions come from cars and 28% from homes, according to the Energy Saving Trust. \"It is imperative that we become more aware of the energy we use in our homes and reduce our carbon dioxide emissions,\" warns Philip Sellwood, the trust's chief executive. </p> <p>\"Every time a light is switched on or a video is left on standby, carbon dioxide is emitted from a power station, causing damage to the environment. </p> <p>The worst scenario for 2050 in the trust's report are based on studies of the likely impact on the UK's environment. Lack of snow could render Scotland's ski resorts redundant in 20 years. Daffodils, bluebells and crocuses might disappear because of warmer winters, as would spruce trees. Cod would fail to flourish in warmer waters and could be replaced by tuna. </p> <p>Termites are already spreading north on the continent and are in France. Mosquitoes carrying fatal diseases could become a regular feature of the countryside. West Nile fever has already become endemic in the United States due to rising temperatures. Poisonous spiders could also flourish without winter frosts. </p> <p> <strong> On the way in</strong></p> <p> <strong> Creepy crawlies</strong> <br>Ticks, scorpions and poisonous spiders could become common in the hotter UK.</p> <p><strong> Hay fever</strong><br> Hay fever could be experienced for months on end as trees and grasses flower far beyond their previous seasons.</p> <p><strong> Pest control</strong><br> We will need to take action to control fleas, wasps, mice and rats, which thrive mild winters and hot summers.</p> <p><strong> Sharks</strong> <br> More types of sharks and stingrays could visit our warmer waters.</p> <p><strong> Termites</strong><br> These pests are spreading north through Europe and could reach the UK.</p> <p><strong> Diseases</strong><br> Mosquitoes carrying diseases such as Dengue fever and West Nile virus have already invaded the US and could become a regular feature here.</p> <p><strong> On the way out</strong></p> <p> <strong> Cod</strong><br> Warm waters further threaten dwindling numbers, with cod-and-chips potentially relegated to a thing of the past. </p> <p><strong> Scotland's ski resorts</strong><br> With milder temperatures and less snow, Scotland's ski industry has already had to diversify into other activities such as mountain biking and paragliding. </p> <p><strong> Golf courses</strong><br> These could become very expensive to maintain in the long, hot summers, with drought and water restrictions affecting the quality of grass, and waterlogged conditions in winter. </p> <p><strong> The village green</strong><br> Traditional greens could become difficult to maintain, as soaring temperatures and drought turn them brown.</p> <p><strong> Dormouse</strong><br> It could disappear as warmer summers and milder winters threaten its habitat.</p> <p><strong> Sunbathing</strong><br> Holidaymakers are likely to become more cautious of the summer sun.</p> <p><strong> Daffodils</strong><br> Warmer winters will threaten daffs and crocuses.</p>",
  "Recently, I got a call from a friend who'd been talking to a friend who had told her that there was going to be a bomb attack in central London on a particular day and had urged her to warn friends and family to stay well clear. There were similar rumours from other friends. How many people altered their plans for that day accordingly? How many others felt a sharp stab of anxiety as they stepped on to the underground escalator on their way to work? How many more have just got so used now to living with fear that it is a low-level constant in their anxious, stressed lives? <p>Fear has become the dominant currency of public life - our politics and our streets - and it reaches deep into our most private emotions. The biggest fears are, of course, those generated by the war on terror - with its motley cast of (mostly fictional) demons from ricin manufacturers to mad mullahs. But there are legions of other fearful phenomena crowding the airwaves and newspaper columns, from obesity to dodgy chicken legs. Some may have a basis in fact, but it is their inflation and our inability to grasp the nature of their risk that is the issue. Despite the unprecedented security of life in the west - we live for longer and are less vulnerable to absolute poverty than any previous generation of human beings - we seem more anxious, and fearful than ever. Why? </p> <p>This is the big question to which Adam Curtis is boldly offering an answer in his hugely important BBC series, The Power of Nightmares. Politicians once offered dreams of a better future; now they offer to protect us from nightmares. Fear becomes the political resource to be mined to boost politicians' own legitimacy and authority, argues Curtis as he traces the parallel development of the neo-cons in the US and Islamist terrorism. </p> <p>His analysis is unfolding before our eyes in the US elections. Power goes to those with the darkest nightmares, he argues. Kerry might be the more effective and competent debater, but that's not the point. Bush echoes the fear he has helped create. Fear is an emotion best assuaged by being shared. As one banner read at a recent Bush rally: \"You make me feel safe.\" </p> <p>The issue Curtis has set to explain is, as one of the most perceptive commentators featured in the series, Bill Durodi\u00e9, director of the International Centre for Security Analysis at King's College, puts it, \"why the juggernaut of the west is so preoccupied by the flea of al-Qaida\". Durodi\u00e9 points out that the number of terrorist incidents has gone down, not up, in the past decade and the vast majority of them are in places such as Kashmir. We face a tiny threat in comparison with what our grandparents faced in the late 30s - estimates of casualties from aerial bombardment in 1937 were put at 600,000 - with a fraction of their stoicism. </p> <p>Curtis's conclusion is basically that the neo-cons needed an enemy against which to define and justify an aggressive American imperialism. The nightmares provide an elite with the means to manipulate and manage the masses. His series has attracted controversy for its claim that al-Qaida doesn't exist (in any of the ways widely imagined, such as a global network of terrorists directed by someone from a hi-tech cave in the Hindu Kush) but what also requires attention is far closer interrogation of two questions he doesn't have room to explore. </p> <p>First, why are millions of perfectly sensible people so susceptible to the nightmares, and so bad at stripping back the fantasy to measure the true scale of risk? Durodi\u00e9 argues in a recent paper that while fear has often been used as a political tool in history, we are particularly vulnerable to it now because of how isolated and fragmented our lives are. He points to the second world war when the only incidence of panic was when people were isolated. </p> <p>Without the moorings of social connectedness to political, religious institutions and neighbourhoods, we have no reality check on our own fears. For example, without gossiping to the neighbour how do we build up that mutual assessment of risk to the wellbeing of our children? Furthermore, he suggests that our profound sense of insecurity is not fuelled by the perception that the world is changing very fast (to which Blair often refers) but rather by the fact that our collective ability to shape that change is so cripplingly weak (not an issue on which Blair wants to dwell). </p> <p>Closely related to this argument, the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman argues, in an essay to be published soon, that politicians have abdicated any responsibility for moderating the impact of the inherent insecurity and instability of market capitalism so they offer to assuage other types of insecurity, in particular our physical safety. Take his argument further, and it seems that as we are left to negotiate our own unpredictable and anxious course through the winner-takes-all society, we search for other focuses for our fear as a relief or justification for our performance or failure. We want nightmares to distract us. </p> <p>Second, what happens to a society that becomes so fearful? It offers politicians power, and it also promises goodies to security consultants, helpful academics and defence and police forces. It gobbles up taxpayers' money, and insurance premiums with precious little accountability. The peddling of fear is a lucrative business: security is the biggest global growth industry. Fear shifts newspapers and glues viewers to their TV screens. The media become profoundly complicit in promoting the interests of those who use fear, from terrorist to security analyst. </p> <p>We need to be much more aware of the corrosive impact of fear on politics and civil society. The ugliest and most powerful of political emotions, it short-circuits and distorts political debate. Once unleashed, it is very hard to reverse. Figures last week showed that while crime has fallen, fear of crime remains stubbornly high. Fear has its short-term uses for both politicians and the media but it delivers diminishing returns. One way to manage fear is to simply switch off: don't bother voting or watching the news, try Wife Swap instead. Worst of all, fear gets displaced. It may start as an insecurity over a job, a worry over a pension, but it can end up as racism. Fear needs clearly identifiable enemies. As the global flow of people speeds up, and our cities and countries become more diverse, there is no shortage of material out of which to fantasise the enemies of our nightmares. </p> <p>So when you feel afraid, question who or what has made you so - and why it was in their interests to do so - assess the risk, and always remember how much destruction fear ultimately wreaks on everything we call civilisation. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The second part of The Power of Nightmares is on BBC2 on Wednesday </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The attitude of the Stop the War coalition is not accurately presented in your article (Union fury at Stop the War coalition's sectarianism, October 23). Our position, which is the same as that adopted at the TUC conference, is that an early date be set for the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq. <p>The choice presented to the Labour party conference was either to call for Tony Blair to \"set an early date\" for troop withdrawal or to support a statement legitimising the occupation until December 2005 at the least, and beyond under certain circumstances. Regrettably, the conference voted for the latter option. </p> <p>The illegal occupation is killing hundreds of Iraqis and the lives of British soldiers are being needlessly placed at risk.

It provided an excuse for union leaders who, for their own reasons, did not wish to confront Tony Blair. </p> <p>Many trade unionists regret the way in which the IFTU was used against the anti-war movement in Brighton. This does not mean that we should condemn those seeking to build independent trade unions in Iraq. Those building IFTU unions, and other independent trade unions, deserve our support and solidarity. <br><b>Jon Rogers</b><br> Lambeth Unison branch secretary </p> <p>The dispute over the Stop the War coalition's attitude to the IFTU is not primarily a disagreement over how long British troops should stay in Iraq. It is about Stop the War's refusal to take a stand of solidarity with working-class, women's and other democratic organisations in Iraq, and its preference for the fascistic militias of the neo-Ba'athist/ Islamist \"resistance\" over such progressive forces. </p> <p>It is possible to criticise the IFTU for its softness on many issues, while extending its solidarity as a genuine organisation of the Iraqi working class. But they are simply not interested in workers. You describe Stop the War's leadership as Trotskyist, but its approach is Stalinist to the core. <br><b>Sacha Ismail</b><br> Alliance for Workers' Liberty </p> <p>Abdullah Muhsin is at odds with the facts when he writes that he did \"not offer voting advice to trade unions on Labour's Iraq motions\" (We are nobody's pawns, October 23). In fact, his advice was printed in the party's official daily briefing for all delegates and in a special \"open letter to trade union delegates\", in which he wrote that an early date for withdrawal of troops \"would be bad for my country, and would play into the hands of extremists\". <br><b>Carol Turner</b><br> Secretary, Labour CND </p> <p>Abdullah Muhsin speaks for a group that has usurped the representation of Iraqi workers using Saddam's law No 71 of 1987, and by means of administrative orders of the US/British occupation and its Iraqi governing council. His communist turned neo-con faction helped provide political cover for war and sanctions. The group was key in the consolidation of the Saddam dictatorship, and now it is allied to the occupation. <br><b>Kamil Mahdik</b><br> Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies, University of Exeter</p>",
  "<p>The honey bee, long seen as the world's most important insect, is now helping scientists to discover how alcohol affects the brain. </p> <p>The study is part of long-term research into whether alcohol increases aggressive behaviour in humans. </p> <p>Scientists at Ohio State University fed honey bees different amounts of alcohol and watched how long they spent walking, flying, grooming or just lying on their backs. They also measured the level of alcohol in the bees' haemolyph - the equivalent of blood. Unsurprisingly, the more the bees drank, the less they moved around. </p> <p>Julie Mustard, the entomologist leading the research, said that, at the molecular level, bees' brains worked in the same way as those of humans. </p> <p>\"Knowing how chronic alcohol use affects genes and proteins in the honey bee brain may help us eventually understand how alcoholism affects memory and behaviour in humans, as well as the molecular basis of addiction,\" she said. </p> <p>The research was presented at a weekend conference organised by the Society for Neuroscience. </p> <p>The researchers gave bees ethanol solutions, with concentrations ranging from 10% to 100%. Those given the highest amounts of ethanol spent the most time lying on their backs. \"These bees had lost postural control,\" said Ms Mustard. \"They couldn't coordinate their legs well enough to flip themselves back over again.\" </p> <p>Another researcher, Geraldine Wright, pointed out: \"Honey bees are very social animals, which makes them a great model for studying the effects of alcohol in a social context. </p> <p>\"Many people get aggressive when they drink too much. We want to learn if ethanol makes the normally calm, friendly honey bee more aggressive. We may be able to examine how ethanol affects the neural basis of aggression in this insect and, in turn, learn how it affects humans.\" </p> <p>It is not the first time that bees have been used in scientific research. Five years ago, they were used to help detect landmines. US government chemists trained bees to sniff out the tiny amounts of volatile chemicals emitted by mines.</p>",
  "<b> Economist </b> <br>Editorial, October 21 <p> \"[This week] Israel's prime minister intends to ask his parliament to approve a plan to evacuate all of the Jewish settlements Israel has established in the Gaza strip ... This will mark the first time in more than 20 years that Israel has uprooted Jews from the land it occupied and colonised after the war of 1967. It will be an act of profound symbolism, which is why so many Israelis - and much of Ariel Sharon's own Likud party - have sworn to prevent it. </p> <p>\"But unless Israel is capable of giving up many or most of its settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, no Palestinian state is likely to arise in these areas, which means that there will be no lasting peace. For that reason, the world needs to swallow its natural scepticism about Mr Sharon's motives, and - in this internal fight at least - do what it can to help him prevail.\" </p> <p><b> Aluf Benn</b><br> Los Angeles Times, October 24  </p> <p> \"Israel has fallen into its worst domestic crisis in almost a decade as the country angrily debates Mr Sharon's plan ... Likud, Mr Sharon's ruling party, has been torn apart by the disengagement dispute ... For Mr Sharon, fighting uphill to keep his plan on track, Tuesday's [Knesset] vote is just the beginning; this will continue until the pullout itself, scheduled for the summer of 2005 ...

The main danger is the tough opposition to withdrawal by the settlers and their supporters ... The demand to prefer halakha (Jewish law) over the law of the land, to exclude Israel's Arab citizens from the process of approving disengagement, to deviate from accepted norms of debate and decision-making, to shut up opposition by means both administrative and juridical, are all clouds that presage the storm ...

This can only be achieved by ensuring the legitimacy of the disengagement plan meets the criteria of the spirit, as well as the letter, of democracy ... </p> <p>\"Under the circumstances [new elections are] the lesser of the evils facing us. If new elections produce a solid majority in favour of disengagement, the extreme right wing will revert to its natural proportions ...

  "Standards required of teachers in British schools are \"pitched pitifully low\", compared with similar countries, according to a critical report out today. <p>A study by a commission including education academics and the former chief inspector of schools Chris Woodhead brands the teacher training system a failure, and says many staff - particularly at primary level - have inadequate knowledge of their subjects. \"Many teachers don't understand what it is they are teaching,\" says the study. </p> <p>The report, published by the right-leaning thinktank Politeia, also attacks both undergraduate and post-graduate teaching qualifications, claiming they are unreliable and \"the victim of bureaucratic box-ticking criteria\". It favours a move to more school-based training, claiming that university education departments \"indoctrinate teachers\" and are hotbeds of \"fanciful ideas and inflated theory\". </p> <p>The study will be criticised as ideologically driven, with the anti-state control, pro-free market views of Mr Woodhead clearly stamped upon it. </p> <p>However, the senior educationalist Alan Smithers, professor at Buckingham University's centre of education and employment research and a member of the commission, argues that the low drop-out rate of school-based training compared with university courses proves the success of the employment-based route. It is also easier to balance supply and demand if schools recruit directly, rather than universities turning out fixed numbers of staff, he says. </p> <p>The Politeia study, Comparing Standards: Training the Teachers, says standards demanded of would-be teachers should be raised both at entry to training and on courses themselves in order to ensure a better qualified profession. </p> <p>Primary teachers should have A-levels in the subjects they will teach and be brought to A-level standard in maths and English, the study argues. At present, they are required to have reached only GCSE level in English and maths. </p> <p>The commission also recommends that all secondary teachers should have a degree in the subject they teach. </p> <p>It also says teachers should qualify through knowing their subjects and says the academic institution in which they train should decide who is qualified to teach, rather than officials or quangos - a swipe at what it claims is government \"micromanaging\" of teacher training through central targets. </p> <p>The attack follows a row this month over the obstacles faced by Tristram Jones-Parry, retiring head of the top independent Westminster School, when he sought to teach in the state sector. He was told he was not qualified to teach in a state school, though the Teacher Training Agency said he could be assessed in a matter of days. Unions insisted it was right to have high standards for entry to the profession. </p> <p>Responding to the report, a Department for Education and Skills spokeswoman said: \"Ofsted tell us that we have the best generation of trainee teachers ever. We are continuing to make year-on-year progress on standards. Every year since 1997, more pupils have done well.\"</p>",
  "Israel's parliament will today begin debating bitterly opposed legislation to remove Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip next year ahead of a vote that could force a major realignment of Israeli politics. <p>Thousands of settlers and their supporters plan to lay siege to parliament in an attempt to block a vote on the bill tomorrow that Ariel Sharon is likely to win but which is expected to split his party and force him to rely on the support of the opposition. </p> <p>The prime minister's unilateral \"disengagement plan\" has also divided the military, religious leaders and ordinary Israelis, some of whom see it as a step toward easing the conflict with the Palestinians and others who argue that it is rewarding terrorism by surrendering land that is rightfully Israel's. </p> <p>Mr Sharon's fractured cabinet yesterday approved legislation outlining compensation of up to $500,000 (\u00a3278,000) for settlers who are forced from their homes and jail terms for those who resist. </p> <p>The prime minister was backed by his arch rival, Binyamin Netanyahu, and other ministers who initially agitated against the disengagement plan. But he was opposed by key figures on the far right of the ruling Likud party such as Uzi Landau and Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident who likened the disengagement legislation to oppression in the USSR. Mr Sharon has said he will sack ministers who vote against the plan. </p> <p>The real confrontation will come over the next two days during the parliamentary debate on the bill. About 18 of the Likud party's 40 MPs say they intend to vote against the legislation. </p> <p>At the weekend, the spiritual leader of the religious Shas party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, ruled that its MPs are obliged to vote against the plan. </p> <p>That will leave the prime minister reliant on the opposition Labour party to force it through and with a government commanding the reliable support of as little as one-third of MPs. </p> <p>Shimon Peres, the Labour leader, said the vote will be one of the strangest in Israel's history. \"The main opposition party in its entirety will support the prime minister's policy whereas the prime minis ter's party will split in the vote and about half the members will vote against the prime minister,\" he said. </p> <p>\"On Wednesday we will stand before a new political reality of a minority government that cannot function, and most of its members are against the prime minister and against forming a different coalition.\" </p> <p>Labour has pledged to provide a \"safety net\" in parliament for the disengagement legislation but Mr Peres is not committed to propping up the government on other contentious issues, particularly its economic policies. </p> <p>The Labour leader has not yet said how his party will vote when the annual budget comes before parliament next week. Normally it would be expected to oppose the programme of austerity measures but that could bring the government down if Likud opponents of the Gaza withdrawal also voted against the budget. </p> <p>Some Likud MPs say they will vote against the government on every bill unless Mr Sharon agrees to hold a national referendum on the withdrawal from Gaza. The prime minister is likely to win a referendum but he says it is a delaying tactic that could postpone the pullout by a year. </p> <p>The crisis lays the ground for coalition negotiations between Likud and Labour, although the bodies of both parties are against it. A majority of Likud MPs is opposed to bringing Labour into government. </p> <p>Mr Peres could force his party's hand but he is believed to be looking for commitments on an election date by the end of next year and assurances Mr Sharon is not pulling 7,500 settlers out of Gaza only to expand Jewish settlements on the West Bank that are home to about 420,000 people. </p> <p>Government lawyers have told the administration that pulling the settlers and troops out of the Gaza Strip will not relieve it of its legal responsibilities as an occupying power. The assessment, submitted to the national security council, also warns that foreign governments will not recognise the withdrawal as an end to the occupation because Israel will continue to control the airspace over the Gaza Strip and its border with Egypt.</p>",
  "After Ariel Sharon bulldozed Avi Farhan from his house 22 years ago, the embittered Jewish settler tramped from his wrecked village in the Sinai desert to Jerusalem waving an Israeli flag. A few months later, at Mr Sharon's urging, he founded a new settlement in the occupied Gaza Strip. <p>Today Mr Farhan will walk back into Jerusalem carrying the same flag to protest against the prime minister's latest plan to throw him out of his home. </p> <p>He will join thousands of other Israelis who intend to lay siege to parliament for what is expected to be a furious debate on a bill authorising Mr Sharon to remove about 8,000 settlers from Gaza and the north of the West Bank - a plan that is dividing the country, the army, the government party, and even the settlers. </p> <p>\"I can't believe Sharon really wants to do this. He's the one who told us to come here,\" Mr Farhan said. </p> <p>\"I gave birth to this place. This is my life's work. We came here with two families, we lived in an old bus, we lived in poverty. Some of my children were born here and my grandchildren. It's transfer of Jews. Why does the Jew always have to pay the price?\" </p> <p>Mr Farhan, 59, was the last settler to leave Yamit, the Jewish colony in the Sinai destroyed on the orders of Mr Sharon, then defence minister, before the peninsula was handed back to Egypt in 1982. </p> <p>\"It took a week to walk to Jerusalem. When I got there, people asked me what I would do next. I didn't prepare an alternative home so I said I would build a refugee camp outside Erez [on the edge of the Gaza strip] until I could get back to my home in Sinai,\" he said. </p> <p>\"[Sharon] asked me why I was setting up a refugee camp: 'Why don't you start a settlement in the area?' He showed me the maps and I immediately decided the settlement had to be here because it reminds me of Yamit - the sea, the sand, the view.\" </p> <p>He called it Elei Sinai - back to Sinai - in memory of Yamit. Today it houses about 90 families in large bungalows on the northern tip of the Gaza Strip, scattered among sand dunes beside the Mediterranean. </p> <p>\"We're not here because of ideology,\" said Eli Bohadana, who moved to the settlement 12 years ago. \"I saw the sea, I saw the people, I fell in love with the place. Most people here think that Sharon's plan is immoral and a crime against humanity. I'm surprised that the free world is an indifferent bystander when thousands of families are going to be deported from their houses. It doesn't matter if it's Arabs or Jews.\" </p> <p>Elei Sinai is one of the 21 settlements whose 7,500 residents occupy about one-fifth of the Gaza strip. Some are wedded to what they claim is theirs by biblical right; others came for the lifestyle of subsidised housing beside the sea. </p> <p>They are separated from the 1.4 million Palestinians crowded into the rest of the territory by barbed wire, death strips and army watchposts. Palestinian movements are greatly restricted by military check points which have been closed for days at a time in recent weeks, cutting people off from their jobs, schools and families while settlers drive freely on bridges built over Palestinian roads. </p> <p>But there is not much sympathy in Elei Sinai where two residents - one a woman jogger, the other a soldier who tried to help her - were shot dead by a Palestinian sniper last month. Two years ago a teenage couple was killed by a gun and grenade attack which also injured several young children. </p> <p>The government is offering each settler family up to\u00a3273,000 to leave, possibly more, since Mr Sharon has said that he will increase the compensation. </p> <p>A couple of families in Elei Sinai have said they will take the money, but most have agreed to the formation of a resistance committee. </p> <p>Some have called the prime minister a traitor, because he was the architect of the rapid expansion of Israel's colonies 20 years ago. Few are persuaded by his hint that giving up the Gaza settlements will assure Israel's long term control over those in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where about 420,000 Jews live. </p> <p>Nor do they think that pulling the settlers out of Gaza offers a step toward ending the conflict with the Palestinians. Some see it as a form of surrender to Hamas and Palestinian resistance that will only encourage more violence. </p> <p>It is unclear how many settlers will violently resist if the army is sent in to remove them. But Mr Bohadana is not among them. </p> <p>\"I won't resist physically. I might stay to the last day but I won't resist with violence. I won't raise a hand to a soldier, but if I was a soldier I would disobey an order to evacuate the settlements,\" he said. </p> <p>Sarita Maoz was 14 when her family was forced to leave Yamit. When she married, she moved to Elei Sinai and her three children were born there. </p> <p>Her father, she said, a deeply religious man living in Gush Katif, the largest settlement in the Gaza Strip, would stay until the last day. But she intended to get out before then. </p> <p>\"I don't want our children to go through the same thing I went through, which is why we'll take them out before the houses are destroyed. </p> <p>\"You can never tell what will happen. I know our people. They can take a lot. They've been through many conflicts and don't rebel easily. But you can never foresee how someone will react when he is forced from his home.\" </p> <p>These days the debate in Elei Sinai is not so much about if they will have to leave as whether their homes should be bulldozed like those in Yamit or left standing for Palestinians to live in. </p> <p>\"I would rather my home went to a Palestinian family that really needs it, but I'm in a minority. </p> <p>\"There are those who can't bear the thought of terrorists moving into the home,\" Mr Bohadana said. </p> <p>\"I would leave my home for peace, which a lot of people wouldn't do in Jaffa, where Jews took Arab houses. We didn't take anyone's houses. It's so immoral. </p> <p>\"If and when it happens I would like to live as far away from here as possible. I don't know if I want to stay in this country.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>What was your first experience of travel?</strong><br> It was 1968 and I'd only ever been out of England once, and then not by plane. I flew with BOAC from London via Rome and Tripoli to Entebbe in Uganda. I didn't choose Uganda, it chose me. Uganda was a fantastic introduction because all human life is there and all vegetation, too. I spent a year teaching for VSO in a remote village about 250 miles north of Kampala right on the banks of the Nile. It was exotic in the extreme and very beautiful.</p> <p><strong>Have you been back?</strong><br> I only really became a hack in order to go back. Travel had so broadened my mind that I wanted to go on doing it. I didn't have the faith to be a missionary and I didn't have the medicine to be a doctor so it seemed that hacking was the only chance. Uganda was my first proper foreign assignment. As a reporter with LBC (London Broadcasting and Commercial radio) in 1974 I accompanied Jim Callaghan, then Foreign Secretary, to go and rescue Dennis Hills, a white lecturer who had upset Idi Amin. I was the only person on the plane who had ever been to Uganda. It was serendipitous and set me up rather well. Because I knew where the telephone exchange was I was able to file the story before anyone else did.</p> <p><strong>Where did you go next?</strong><br> After Uganda the next trip that really turned me on to travel was a strange Liverpool University exchange. We drove overland in a bus from Liverpool to Benares (now called Varanasi) in India and it was absolutely fantastic. We took a four-part harmony Beatles cover band and I sang bass - we stopped to give concerts along the way in basketball stadiums and so on. It took us six week. It's a very hard trip to do now; the places in between are pretty dodgy.</p> <p><strong>How do you prepare for travelling now?</strong><br> I still get nervous if I'm going to a place I haven't been before or haven't been for a very long time and don't know anyone there, such as Iraq. As soon as I get on the plane and switch on the old CD I'm fine, though. I use music as a kind of mental transportation device. I also never drink booze on a plane because I'm absolutely certain it adds to jet lag and I always set my watch to the time at the destination before we leave so that I'm psychologically in tune with the hour it will be when I get there.</p> <p><strong>What have been your hairiest assignments?</strong><br> Kosovo, Iraq but particularly El Salvador. I was there during the heat of the war and crossed over the lines and back again. I wouldn't say I go to these places because of the thrill, but because of a remorseless inquisitiveness. Iraq is the most amazing country. One day - an ever more distant day - it would be the most fantastic tourist destination. I think it is most evidently the cradle of civilisation.</p> <p><strong>How do you wind down when not travelling for work?</strong><br> I'm a complete sloth. Every Easter I go to the Morven peninsula on the west coast of Scotland. I think there are 300 people and 3,000 sheep. It has a whiff of New Zealand about it. Mobiles don't work, there's no telly and it's just heaven. I've been going to Cape Cod every summer for 20 years, too. It's got the weather, and because it is a national park it's got wonderful dunes and deserted beaches. White clapperboard houses, small towns and quite a lot of art.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Jon Snow's autobiography Shooting History is out now, \u00a320, published by HarperCollins</p>",
  "<p>Imagine an expanse of dusty desert beside a greasy sea, sweltering under a pitiless sun. Now cover it with six-lane highways, flyovers, spaghetti junctions and all the nastiest buildings you have ever seen. Think Birmingham without its beauty, Las Vegas without its culture. Dubai is unquestionably the ugliest city in the world - there should be a socking great sign at the airport saying 'Abandon all taste, ye who enter here.' And yet it is the third most popular long-haul destination (after Barbados and Mauritius) for British Airways Holidays. Why? </p> <p>Well, first, if you forget good taste, there is astonishing luxury to be had. I stayed at the Al Qasr, a new five-star hotel on Jumeirah Beach, which is described as 'the Venice of Arabia' because it has a couple of canals running through the gardens. (You soon get used to this level of hyperbole in Dubai - almost every building claims to be the eighth wonder of the world.) The first thing you see as you turn into the drive is a life-size herd of shiny gold plastic horses gambolling on the lurid lawns. But you don't have to look at them for long because dozens of staff come rushing out of the hotel to greet you like a long-lost cousin and offer you sweets and Arabic coffee. </p> <p>The welcome is so warm that you can forgive the gruesome chandeliers and eye-grazing carpets in the lobby, though going to your room provides another shock - someone has gone to an immense amount of trouble to make it look exactly like a Sixties' Indian restaurant. But it is a very large room, with a supremely comfortable bed and well-equipped bathroom. In the end I almost became fond of it, though I did wake up every morning thinking, why maroon and orange stripes? And why those giant tassles on the television cabinet? It is a pity the design is so hideous because in all other respects the Al Qasr is a superb hotel - the food is delicious, the staff friendly, the service impeccable and it has a state-of-the-art spa called the Six Senses, which you reach rather charmingly by abra (boat) along the canal. It also has a delicious chilled swimming pool, which you do need in the Dubai climate. </p> <p>The climate is Dubai's elephant in the room - nobody mentions it. The brochures talk of guaranteed winter sun and no rain and that is certainly true - the last measurable rainfall was in 1997 when it rained for a whole night. There have been one or two showers since then but you can safely forget your umbrella when packing for Dubai. And it's true that the sun's reliable, too - boiling sun, implacable sun, sun that will fry you if you go on the beach at midday. Even the locals admit that Dubai is intolerable in July and August. </p> <p>I thought it was pretty intolerable when I went in September - the temperature seldom fell below the high 30s, even at night, and walking outside was like wading through soup. Despite being a desert country, it somehow manages to be humid as well. </p> <p>Apparently, British tourists like Dubai (and went on going there right through the 1991 Gulf war) because, as the PR memorably explains, 'People don't associate it with the Middle East.' It doesn't feel like a Muslim country. You can drink alcohol even during Ramadan. The Dubaians, of course, look Arabic, in their immaculate white dish-dashes, but they account for only 18 per cent of the population - the rest are expats from all over Europe, India, Bangladesh, the Philippines, whose common language is English. It is also a very safe country, with no theft or mugging, and nobody ever hassles you in the street. </p> <p>Dubai's main attraction is supposed to be its fabulous shopping, but I couldn't find anything I wanted to buy. There are loads of huge shopping malls with all the same shops as Brent Cross - Ikea, Next, Gap, Debenhams - with marginally cheaper prices. But you surely don't fly eight hours to get \u00a33 off a skirt? The 'bargain' area, Karama, is more exciting if you crave fake watches and fake Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci, and Burberry handbags at dirt cheap prices. But can't you get those in Essex? </p> <p>So what do you do in Dubai apart from shopping? Well first you have to see Burj Al Arab, which is Dubai's own Leaning Tower of Pisa - its silhouette appears on all the car number plates. It is, one might have guessed, a hotel, where the smallest suites cost \u00a31,000 a night and guests are transported by a fleet of white Rolls-Royces. Designed by British architect W. S. Atkins, it is shaped like a sail and has a helicopter pad on top, where Tiger Woods was filmed hitting golf balls into the sea. The outside is great but the inside is like a bad acid trip. The style can best be described as Puff Daddy crossed with Wurlitzer jukebox, plus copious fish and waterfalls. The Royal Suite features a revolving bed and wall-to-wall leopardskin - apparently, the rapper 50 Cent stayed there the other week and loved it. </p> <p>'Historic' Dubai does not take long to see. The oldest building is a tiny fort like a child's sandcastle, which dates from the l8th century and houses the Dubai Museum. Then there is Sheikh Saeed's house, built in 1896, and a few Persian windtower houses built in the early 20th century. That's about it for historic buildings. Someone pointed out to me the Hard Rock Cafe, a squat unimpressive block overshadowed by skyscrapers, and said it used to be a great landmark - you could see it from miles away as you drove down from Abu Dhabi, and it marked the end of the desert and the beginning of town. But that was all of eight years ago, and the city has engulfed it since then. </p> <p>What is truly sensational about Dubai is the speed at which it is growing. You could go away for a week and return to find a 20-storey skyscraper outside your window. Housing estates and shopping malls arrive like flying ants. Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince, has decreed that by the time the oil runs out Dubai will be the financial and commercial centre for the whole Middle East. Three years ago he changed the law to allow foreigners to buy property and establish residency - hence the rush for real estate. Everywhere you go you see architects' drawings and models of the next new thing - the world's biggest shopping mall, the world's tallest skyscraper, the world's biggest maze. One of the new housing estates, International City, promises 'a recreation of the Forbidden City that will transport the magic of Chinese culture to the desert' - with parking for 2,000 cars. </p> <p>The Dubai coastline is already almost totally built up, so now they are building artificial islands out into the Gulf, which will add 120 kilometres to the Dubai shoreline. The first of these, the Palm, is already visible: a man-made structure in the shape of a palm tree, it will have apartment blocks and hotels along the stem and private beachfront villas on the fronds (one of which David Beckham has acquired). Like everything in Dubai, it has been built at incredible speed - land reclamation started in December 2001 and finished in November 2003; now they are building a 10-lane bridge to the trunk, and the first houses are already going up. All the apartment blocks sold out in the first three hours. </p> <p>Work has already started on a second Palm, which will be 40 per cent larger than the first, and there's also the World, consisting of 300 islands in the shape of different countries, which will be completed by 2008. Seventy islands have already been sold - someone bought Australia on the very first day. Owners can build what they like on their islands, or not build at all. The promotional video bizarrely shows people trekking through a rainforest and emerging on to a broad savannah with a herd of wildebeest stampeding by.

  "<p>Before I set off to research A Hedonist's Guide to Tallinn, I had vague notions of the Estonian capital as the 'new Prague', with a reputation as a cult party spot. If I was expecting some kind of Baltic Babylon, however, I was soon to be surprised. The Tallinn I discovered was a style-conscious city full of medieval charm and modern manners, determined to defy the stag party stereotypes. </p> <p>Estonia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Since then it has exploded into life with an economic boom and a taste for European sophistication. My mission was to seek out the finest hotels, restaurants, cafes and clubs - to get the insider's view. Luckily for me, the Old Town - the centre of the tourist action - is less than a mile square, so getting round all the important spots was easy on foot. But it didn't take long to realise that there was more to Tallinn than the rather Disneyish centre, with its picture-postcard buildings and package tours. Much of the 'real' Tallinn exists outside the ancient walls - whether in leafy, Tsarist Kadriorg Park, the trendy, regenerated Portside area or the bustling modern district with its department stores and hotels.</p> <p>Almost everything is post-Soviet-new, and it feels as if the Estonians have approached the business of nightlife as an exercise in reinvention: anything is possible. I came across restaurants and bars themed as Greek, Indian, Thai, French, Georgian, Italian - even English. And now the book's finished, I find myself returning to Estonia again and again, in my own time and without a notebook. There are just so many great places to revisit - and here are the ones that I'll head to first.</p> <p><strong> Bars</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Kaheksa</strong><br> (Vana-Posti 8 - door on M\u00fc\u00fcrivahe; Tel: [00 372 from outside Estonia] 627 4770) </p> <p>Still the uncontested meeting place for Tallinn's richer and more discerning patrons - a mix of media types, party animals and affluent professionals. Kaheksa is next to the famous Club Hollywood (owned by the same company) but is aimed at an older, more choosy market. The room is decorated on a tropical theme with plants and bamboos surrounding a lounge area full of comfy sofas - excellent for people-watching. For the real buzz, come on a Friday night when practically everyone in Tallinn seems to pass through Kaheksa at least once on their way to parties or clubs. The drinks menu is dominated by good cocktails and non-alcoholic fruit drinks. If you want to get into Hollywood, ask the bar staff and they will lead you through a side door to shortcut the queue. </p> <p> <strong> Moskva</strong><br> (Vabaduse v\u00e4ljak 10; Tel: 640 4694) </p> <p> Moskva is a famous cafe, bar and restaurant set over two floors of a former Soviet establishment looking out over Vabaduse ('Freedom') Square. The bar occupies the second floor alongside the restaurant - where trendy young Estonians work on laptops while drinking cappuccino. If you bring your own computer, wireless internet access is free and fast. Later on the bar starts to fill out, with DJs from 8pm. On Fridays Moskva turns into a proper nightclub, with themed parties (R&amp;B or retro, for example) which are usually packed. The design is minimalist: low lighting, tubular chandeliers and waitresses chosen for their looks in red air-hostess uniforms. After a while you may start to feel as if you are spending time on a private jet in the 1970s. The loos are unisex, with glittery seats. </p> <p> <strong> CityGourmet</strong><br> (Maakri 36; Tel: 649 8839) </p> <p> In the modern city centre near the giant Radisson hotel, CityGourmet is a boutique deli-cafe that also functions as a wine merchant and bar, getting lively in the evenings with affluent Tallinners dropping by to enjoy the fine imported wines and snacks (foie gras, sandwiches, delicious olives and antipasti). With a stunning plate-glass window and a wonky, artistic slant to the room - as well as excellent music - this is a charismatic option far from the tourist hordes and the medieval theme pubs. The soothing atmosphere is perfect for lounging with a date or chatting with the locals. </p> <p><strong> Clubs</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> BonBon</strong><br> (Mere pst. 6e; Tel: 661 6080) </p> <p> Moroccan-themed members' nightclub which has opened its doors to the public while retaining its exclusive feel. The club is in the redeveloped port area between the Old Town and the Baltic in buildings that once housed industrial works - alongside a bowling alley, a restaurant and a tourist strip club. Here you will find a seasoned, affluent party crowd - together with models, local celebrities and well-dressed mafiosi. With a smallish dancefloor in the main room and two smaller bars across two floors, BonBon can get packed - and the atmosphere correspondingly lively. Popular with expats - but large groups of drunken tourists are likely to be turned away. </p> <p> <strong> Hollywood </strong><br> (Vana-Posti 8; Tel: 627 4770) </p> <p> One of Tallinn's oldest and most famous nightclubs, Hollywood sits in the middle of the action at the edge of the old town in a blue-lit neo-classical building that also houses the Soprus cinema. Once you have navigated the long queue and the body searches you find yourself with a huge, good-natured party crowd. The nightclub inside reflects its grandiose, tacky exterior - a megaclub disco with two large dancefloors, an upstairs balcony and back rooms which include a VIP area and a sweeping staircase to the loos. </p> <p> <strong> Nightman</strong><br> (Vineeri 4; Tel: 626 1847) </p> <p> Some way south of the old town, Nightman is a cult favourite with Tallinn's clubbers, who descend on this (formerly) gay venue after the other clubs are closed (or slowing down). From 3 or 4am, Nightman starts to fill with happy, relaxed party people who come to enjoy the excellent music and atmosphere. Distinguished by its dark interior and a large podium dancefloor in the centre of the main room, the club is built on two floors but is small enough to stay intimate and friendly. Most of the action happens upstairs but a second bar next to the entrance is good for conversation. There is still a gay scene here, though all nights are mixed. </p> <p><strong> Restaurants</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Controvento</strong><br> (Vene 12/Katariina k\u00e4ik; Tel: 644 0470) </p> <p> In a tiny alley bordered on one side by the crumbling wall of a medieval church and crammed with tiny boutiques, this famous Italian restaurant complements its setting. Be warned, however, that you could walk past this celebrated alleyway a hundred times if you didn't know it was there. It would be hard to find a more romantic spot for dinner, inside an ancient building decorated in a rustic, Renaissance style, opposite a wall covered with 14th-century marble tombstones. A heavy wooden door opens into the warm glow of the bar, where staff will direct you upstairs to the restaurant or seat you in the cosy cafe downstairs. Upstairs there are two rooms: a smart, stylish area more suited to formal dinners; and a cosier, wood-beamed room with pretty stencil murals. Controvento is owned by Italians, a rarity in the Tallinn restaurant business, and the kitchen is run by three chefs - from Italy, Peru and Ecuador. The menu is versatile enough for all budgets, from simple pasta dishes to four-course feasts with truffles. Make sure you book in advance. </p> <p> <strong> Olde Hansa</strong><br> (Vanaturg 1; Tel: 627 9020) </p> <p> Not so much Estonian as Hanseatic, Olde Hansa harks back to the days when Teutonic merchants ruled the cities of the Baltic with a passion for trade that made Tallinn a great medieval capital. Built in an imposing merchant's house next to Town Hall Square, this enormous restaurant is a fixture of the Tallinn scene and should not be missed. Olde Hansa is built on the vivid imagination of the owners - two medievalists who believe in bringing Estonia's history to life. Sit at one of the rough-hewn tables in the huge, candlelit galleries downstairs or go up for the full medieval experience (which the costumed waiters take as seriously as method actors). The food is hearty, seasoned with sweet garnishes and served with honey beer, the house speciality. Try boar 'marinated in rare spices and cooked over a fire in honour of Waldemar II, the brave king of Denmark'. Choose upstairs to enjoy live medieval music, performed on period instruments. </p> <p> <strong> Egoist</strong><br> (Vene 33: Tel: 646 4052) </p> <p> Climb the steps of this quietly glamorous restaurant and you will find yourself treated like an honoured guest at a private chateau - from the butler who answers the doorbell to the antique silverware and linen. Egoist is owned by chef and entrepreneur Dmitri Damianov, a man who is not afraid to decorate his restaurants with oil paintings of himself. With prices to scare away all but the most confident locals, you are likely to be sharing the dining room with jolly businessmen, fortysomething braggadocios and wealthy Russians. Low-key classic jazz and golden oldies keep the atmosphere from getting too stodgy, while eccentric paintings of dwarves allegedly bring good luck to diners. </p> <p><strong> Cafes</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Cafe Anglais</strong><br> (Raekoja plats 14; Tel: 644 2160) </p> <p> Unusually for a cafe on Town Hall Square, the Anglais is a joint not shunned by locals, who - along with the more knowing ex-pats - flock to this former ambassador's house for the great atmosphere, soft jazz and splendid view. Tucked behind large windows on the first floor you can spy the famous Town Hall Square without having to battle with the tourists taking pictures and buying souvenirs. In summer the Anglais has a tourist-friendly terrace in the sun but for the rest of the year it lurks upstairs like a well-kept secret, via a downstairs entrance shared with a music school and an art gallery. Serving good coffees and teas, beautifully prepared hot chocolate or wine and cocktails, this versatile meeting place also serves light meals throughout the day. At 8pm a pianist joins the party to lull customers with live jazz and lounge music. We regret only that the Anglais closes so early. </p> <p> <strong> Chocolaterie</strong><br> (Vene 6; Tel: 641 8061) </p> <p> Chocolate is treated with almost reli gious reverence in this tiny candlelit cafeteria, which sits alongside an atelier in a hidden courtyard off Vene Street. The house speciality is melted chocolate, piping hot, served with a stick of cinnamon and made in 'classic' and three other flavours: gorgonzola and grappa, rum and raisin, and chilli. Also on offer are home-made chilli-flavoured chocolate and delicious cakes. There is an opium-den feel to Chocolaterie: hushed voices in an intimate, antique-shop sitting room bursting with relics. Music is played low - a welcome departure from most Estonian cafes. This is one of Tallinn's favourite havens - it remains popular with locals (especially women) despite the healthy prices. </p> <p> <strong> Kehrwieder</strong><br> (Saiakang 1) </p> <p> One of the city's most characterful cafes, Kehrwieder is tucked away just below street level in an alley between Town Hall Square and the warren of the medieval city. Inside this tiny Aladdin's cave you will find candlelit tables around which are crammed softly spoken regulars playing board games, chatting and whiling away the hours. A favourite of students and younger Tallinites, its customers are drawn by the intimate atmosphere, laidback music and wicked hot drinks - lovingly prepared chocolate and Irish coffees, gl\u00f6g (mulled wine) and great cakes. The tone is set by stone walls and a hodge-podge of tables, sofas and chairs from old houses. </p> <p><strong> Hotels</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Three Sisters</strong><br> (Pikk 71/Tolli 2; Tel: 630 6300; <a href=\"http://www.threesistershotel.com\">threesistershotel.com</a>, rates \u00a3172-409) </p> <p> The Three Sisters are three medieval houses built in a row, standing next to St Olaf's church - in the 16th century the tallest man-made structure in Europe. Dating back to 1362, the Sisters are some of the most striking and well-preserved buildings of the Old Town, although their current incarnation is very new - this luxury hotel opened only late last year. Already counted among Tallinn's top boutique hotels, it has a stunning interior that combines historic elements (18th century stencilling) with minimalist standards. </p> <p> <strong> St Petersbourg</strong><br> (Rataskaevu 7; Tel: 628 6500; <a href=\"http://www.schlossle-hotels.com\">schlossle-hotels.com</a>, rates \u00a385-330) </p> <p> Unlike many of its competitors, the St Petersbourg can lay claim to real pedigree - it has been a hotel for 150 years, making it the oldest in the city. It wears its Russian roots with pride - built in the 15th century by a Russian merchant, it was home to the first Bolshevik ambassador in 1921. After the comfortable luxury of the lobby, the quality of the rooms is outstanding. There are also some nice touches - every bathroom has its own rubber duck and telephone - and there are rooms equipped for guests with disabilities or allergies. </p> <p> <strong> Villa Mary</strong><br> (Viimsi, Rohuneeme tee 103; Tel: 667 7139; <a href=\"http://www.grandhotel.ee/\">grandhotel.ee/</a> villa, rates \u00a3200-400) </p> <p> Built by the owner of the Meriton Grand Hotel as his private seaside retreat, Villa Mary looks and feels like the home of a millionaire Dr No. Hotelier Alexander Kofkin spends part of the year here next to the windy ocean in Viimsi but also hires the house to private groups - accommodating up to 12 people in five rooms and one apartment. With a spectacular view of the sea - less than 20 metres away at the foot of the garden - Villa Mary combines rugged, windswept charm with unimpeachable luxury. A large salon and balcony look out over prospects of distant Tallinn through a vast window. Mr K's private art collection is housed in the villa, giving it the feel of a slightly madcap gallery, with paintings and sculpture of all varieties. Each room has a theme - there's a 'white' room for bridal couples - and there's a sauna and Japanese grill in the garden.</p> <p><strong>Top five things to do by day</strong></p> <p><strong> Old Town Square (Raekoja plats) </strong> Have a drink on its sundrenched cobbles or sit inside and watch the snow fall. </p> <p><strong> The Old Town </strong> Gaze at perfect merchant houses and stroll beneath the high city walls, left. </p> <p><strong> Toompea Hill </strong> Watch the sun set from here, where Tallinn is at its most medieval. </p> <p><strong> Kadriorg Park </strong> Walk through this beautiful park and visit the Museum of Foreign Art. </p> <p><strong> Tallinn City Museum </strong> For some Hanseatic flavour and rich historical background. </p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong> </p> <p>Estonian Air (020 7333 0196; <a href=\"http://www.estonian-air.com\">estonian-air.com</a>) flies from Gatwick to Tallinn from \u00a3166 return.

  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday October 31 2004</b> <br>  The article below muddled two US politicians when it said, 'To paraphrase Lyndon Johnson, I've seen Gaud\u00ed and this is no Gaud\u00ed', referring to the quote, 'I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy,' a comment made, not by Lyndon Johnson, but by 1988 vice-presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen when debating with vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle.      It's not often - in fact it's the first time ever - that I find myself living a couple of hundred yards away from a story that has begun to make national headlines. Between the local Halifax and Oddbins is a new shop front suddenly boasting the kind of weird, half alive, writhing cement pillars and shop-wide curves that the lauded Catalonian architect Antonio Gaud\u00ed made famous in Barcelona. But this is not Barcelona: it's Muswell Hill, London N10. <p>If it were as good as anything Gaud\u00ed designed, I suspect even the planners at Haringey Council would not be threatening Chris Ostwald with an order to revert to the status quo ante before 15 November or face a \u00a320,000 fine because he built his shop front without planning permission. </p> <p>But they must feel little regret about acting against something that looks as though as it was thrown together overnight to cover up a crack in the window, which is actually how it began. To paraphrase Lyndon Johnson, I've seen Gaud\u00ed and this is no Gaud\u00ed. </p> <p>But equally - and what is prompting a surprisingly lively local argument that has reached the national newspapers - this is not a bog-standard shop front of yet another of the national chains that is creating our cloned, mutually indistinguishable High Streets. Mr Ostwald, enjoying his notoriety as he gathers a petition of support, has become a slightly improbable figure of resistance against the identikit High Street. </p> <p>In truth the council has an open and shut case. To indulge Mr Ostwald would signal an end to Muswell Hill's conservation area, normally defended in this part of London with extraordinary passion. That Ostwald and his tacky shop front have found any support at all is a tribute to our rising concern about living in a universe so homogenised that everybody is just another commodity buying an identical pleasure from the same Clinton Cards, Halifax, McDonald's or Tesco wherever we live. We are being turned into drones and our High Streets into drone land. </p> <p>Homogenisation is not the only threat to the High Street; the other is capitalism's innate tendency to monopoly - and with it to destroy. The rise of out-of-town shopping malls, together with Tesco and Asda on the one hand and discount stores on the other, is putting the High Street under unsustainable pressure. It is becoming the contemporary retailing version of the coal mine, shipbuilder or steel mill - an economic structure that capitalism is leaving behind as pitilessly as once it was invented. </p> <p>Most British High Streets are faced with an accelerating decline into a mish mash of struggling national retail chains quailing before the onward march of Tesco, now apparently accounting for 27 pence of every retailing pound, intermingled with charity shops and oddball third grade specialist shops. The High Street is not where we spend the lion's share of our money - and it increasingly reflects that reality. </p> <p>The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter tagged the adjective creative before the noun destruction to coin the process at work - for if destruction is capitalism's malady its genius is creativity. I may not like flying as another commodity traveller on Ryanair or EasyJet but I very much welcome the price of the ticket, and the entrepreneurship that has created cheap flying. </p> <p>Equally, the fate of the High Street may be sad, but to walk round Tesco's aisles these days is to be offered a grandstand seat in the game of globalisation. I'm always left open-mouthed and stunned. The richness of choice - whether permanently available raspberries or the range of pastas or curry sauces - is intoxicating; and the price for some of the clothes is bewilderingly good value. Creative destruction is a process in which we as consumers are all too willing accomplices. </p> <p>Why, then, any complaint? Part of the explanation is simple nostalgia for a hazy, genial past; the kind of regret that makes our children cling to childhood keepsakes years after they have grown out of them. We all know the feeling and have read the articles mourning the loss of the second-hand bookshop, the friendly butcher and the rambling local department store - a mythical world in which strangers said good morning, communities attended church and all was in near perfect English balance. </p> <p>In truth, many shops were ghastly and their being put to the sword was long overdue - and the so-called attached communities were inward-looking, back-biting and entrapping; the 18-year-old attached to her moth-eaten teddy would no more go back to being three than most of us would substitute Waterstones and Tesco for the second rate shops of the past - but that doesn't stop the feeling of nostalgia. </p> <p>There is, though, another force at work - and to which we need a better understanding and response. It may be true that globalisation is opening up opportunity, choice and rising living standards for both those who produce in countries like China and those of us who buy in Tesco, but it is also delivering bewildering change and a growing sense of loss of control before the juggernaut. </p> <p>There is a simultaneous feeling of empowerment and disempowerment. But if the latter sentiment becomes dominant then the victim will be globalisation and the beneficial onward march of modernity. </p> <p>New Labour, now championing the cause of Big Casinos as it has earlier championed the cause of Big Television and Big Pharma, is impatient of people's fears of globalisation. Because complaint comes from what it regards as the left (and is therefore by definition wrong), the Government can dismiss it. But by siding with the right, Labour politically silences the progressive constituency, which none the less remains loyal because it has no option. </p> <p>The result is a political culture lacking dialogue between progressives and conservatives that might grapple with the forces at work. </p> <p>This absence prevents Britain from building what Gordon Brown calls the progressive consensus on policy responses which might reassure the disempowered. </p> <p>Towards the High Street there could be tougher competition policy; tougher planning laws with more powers given to local government and pressure on landlords to charge less rent. This wouldn't stop the forces at work, but it might tilt the balance a bit away from the inexorable march to sameness and bigness - and offer the disempowered some local counterbalance. </p> <p>To do that, though, we need a stronger progressive consensus which can't be built until the Labour party is gripped by new ideas at the top. In their absence there are just lots of small scale rows like Muswell Hill's - and growing disillusion. It's an unstable political moment; and sooner or later those prepared to champion progressive politics are going to stand up and be counted. It can't and won't go on like this.</p>",
  "<p>How low can the fortunes of Leeds sink? After this wretched afternoon at a rain-swept Withdean, the answer may be that there is still some way to go. </p> <p>They were beaten by a side who went above them in the table as a result, then had two players sent off in the final few minutes, after having three others booked, and were told in no uncertain terms by manager Kevin Blackwell that their performance was unacceptable. </p> <p>If Leeds are to stand any chance of making an impact on this Championship season, they will have to start matching the effort of supposedly inferior teams and keep their frustrations in check. Blackwell will also have to find someone to improve a scoring record inferior to everyone bar rock-bottom Rotherham. </p> <p>Michael Ricketts and Brian Deane are still to register a league goal. Brett Ormerod ended his six-match loan spell from Southampton with another blank and here, for once, Danny Pugh was unable to come to his side's rescue. </p> <p>When Darren Currie's angled free-kick was glanced in by Adam Virgo for his fifth goal as a makeshift striker. The ball deflected off Clarke Carlisle on its way in, but afterwards Virgo insisted that it was goal. </p> <p>Leeds then began to lose the plot. They had plenty of possession, but no cutting edge. Deane and Carlisle headed chances wide and Simon Walton blazed over from Deane's knock-down. Matthew Kilgallon, booked already, tackled substitute Gary Hart from behind and paid the price. </p> <p>Then, in injury time, with Brighton making every effort to run down the clock, skipper Paul Butler saw yellow for dissent, followed by a straight red for further remarks. </p> <p>Blackwell insisted Kilgallon got the ball and pledged to contest Butler's dismissal if referee Richard Beeby puts forward foul language as the reason in his report. But the manager was still furious with his team. </p> <p>'When you know the referee is as bad as this fellow, you keep your mouth shut,' he said. 'What I will say to Paul is between me and him. </p> <p>'Fair play to Brighton. They set out their stall and chased us all over the park. We were not good enough and we got what we deserved - nothing. </p> <p>'With so many youngsters in the side, it's difficult to rip into them too much. But I'm angry and I hope the players are angry too.' </p> <p>Blackwell, who has been pursuing Preston's David Healy, added: 'I don't have the strikers with the wisdom, knowledge and guile. Please God, I will be able to get the players in that I need.' </p> <p>Brighton manager Mark McGhee, whose side deserved the points for greater all-round commitment, said: 'It was an important win because we were in danger of slipping into the bottom three. </p> <p>'The attraction of playing Leeds is still there and the players were determined to get the three points. But we know there is still a lot of work to do to stay in this division.'</p>",
  "<p><strong> EVOLUTION RATHER THAN </strong> revolution is very much the order of the day at Anfield in these early days of the Rafael Ben\u00edtez era. Yet again, mediocre visitors were swept aside, courtesy of outstanding second-half shooting from John Arne Riise and Luis Garc\u00eda, as Liverpool preserved the Premiership's only perfect home record. </p> <p>On the plus side, two impressive goals and some impressive football flowed from midfield. On the minus, Liverpool's current strike force looks decidedly underwhelming. Whatever the future holds under Ben\u00edtez, the process of getting there could be slow and labori ous and better teams than Charlton, Manchester City, West Brom and Norwich will cause greater problems for a Liverpool team still groping to find its identity under new management. </p> <p>Uppermost, the game did little to silence the growing number of critics of the current strike pairing, Milan Baros and Djibril Ciss\u00e9, although the latter's switch to a wide right position proved a pivotal tactical adjustment by Ben\u00edtez late in the first half. </p> <p>In the 52nd minute, it was Ciss\u00e9's cross that found the head of Luis Garc\u00eda, whose effort rebounded off Kevin Lisbie, the loose ball eventually rolling out to Riise, whose fabulous 20-yard left-foot shot flew, untouchable, into the Charlton goal. In the 74th minute, a piece of even more memorable finishing settled the game after former Everton striker Francis Jeffers lost the ball on the halfway line and Xabi Alonso, in turn, found Luis Garc\u00eda. The Spaniard ran some 15 yards before unleashing a right-foot shot from 25 yards that curled exquisitely into the top corner. Job well done - by Ben\u00edtez's midfield, at any rate. </p> <p>'Yes, Baros and Ciss\u00e9 can play together,' insisted the manager. 'You have seen yourself. They had many opportunities. Today, there was not a problem with the strikers. Riise had two opportunities on his right foot - and all the other players... we arrived many times.' </p> <p>Arrived, but failed to score. Just as they had in the midweek goalless European draw with Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, Liverpool carved out enough opportunities to have won at a canter instead of stumbling across the finishing line, one eye looking over their shoulders at their opponents. </p> <p>'Against Deportivo we played very well in the first half,' said Ben\u00edtez. 'Today, we had four, six, 10 clear chances. You play well, but you need to score because when you have these kind of opportunities and don't score, then in the second half you have a mistake, normally you pay.' </p> <p>There was never any realistic danger of paying against a Charlton side that have already lost by four goals at Bolton, Manchester City and Arsenal and should have lost by at least as many here. An early Luis Garc\u00eda volley was well saved by Dean Kiely, Sami Hyypia somehow missed from an unmarked set-piece header six yards out, Ciss\u00e9 hit the foot of the post from 20 yards and Baros missed a hat-trick of chances - all before the break. </p> <p>'At half-time, I thought we were going to be extremely lucky to get anything out of the game,' said Alan Curbishley.

  "<p><strong> A SAD DAY</strong> at White Hart Lane ended with more disappointment for Tottenham, who lost for the fourth game in a row. Bolton's victory secured their best start to a Premiership season and kept them in fourth place and on course for an unlikely European spot. But a compelling game was overshadowed by the death of Bill Nicholson, Tottenham's greatest manager and the club's president. </p> <p>Flags flew at half-mast and the grey skies and incessant rain captured the mood of the home supporters. Tributes flowed, a minute's silence was observed impeccably and most fans were awaiting a suitable reaction from Spurs. As Sam Allardyce, Bolton's manager, said: 'I thought the occasion might give Spurs a bit more \"oomph\" but it didn't happen.' </p> <p>Instead Radhi Jaidi opened the scoring with an early goal, and although Robbie Keane equalised, substitute Henrik Pedersen scored the winner in the 75th minute to send Bolton's fans home happy. </p> <p>'I'm delighted and I thought we deserved to win,' added Allardyce. 'Our performance today was excellent. We now have an array of talent that has done well elsewhere in the world. They are quality players and they have proved that.' </p> <p>While Allardyce's multi-national team thrives, Jacques Santini's league of nations is struggling at the moment, lacking penetration and now starting to creak at the back, conceding two goals for the first time this season. At least they scored, though, and Keane's strike five minutes before half-time was his first league goal of the season and Tottenham's first at home since Jermain Defoe scored the winner against Birmingham in August. </p> <p>Defoe was relegated to the subs' bench yesterday, and his replacement Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 gave them extra height and power in attack. But that counted for little as Bolton took control and the lead in the 11th minute. Gary Speed, still influential at 35, swung in a free-kick from the right and defender Jaidi got his head to the ball at the near post to power it over the line. </p> <p>Tottenham's equaliser followed a move of rare quality, with Pedro Mendes, Nourredine Naybet and Kanout\u00e9 swiftly exchanging passes to allow Keane to drill the ball through Jussi Jaaskelainen's legs from 15 yards. Nicholson would have approved. </p> <p>Bolton absorbed Tottenham's efforts at the start of the second half and looked to attack on the break, and should have increased their lead on the hour when Stelios Giannakopoulos shot wide of the far post from close range. </p> <p>Santini eventually sent on Defoe in the 70th minute, but it was the introduction of Pedersen a minute later that was to be most telling. The Dane scored with almost his first touch, rifling the ball home from close range after Paul Robinson had done brilliantly to keep out, but not hold, thumping shots from Jay Jay Okocha and Stelios in quick succession. Spurs went for an equaliser, Defoe sending a thumping free-kick just wide from 25 yards, and Kanout\u00e9 hit the base of the post with a glancing header 10 minutes from time. </p> <p>Bolton incurred the home supporters' wrath in the final stages with their time-wasting antics, but their emotions at the end were disappointment at another defeat - and sadness for their former manager. </p> <p> <strong> Obituary, page 16</strong> </p> <p> <strong> TOTTENHAM</strong> Robinson; Pamarot, Naybet, King, Gardner; Davies (Ziegler 80), Mendes, Redknapp (Davis 78), Jackson (Defoe 70); Kanout\u00e9, Keane. <strong> Subs not used:</strong> Keller, Brown. </p> <p><strong> BOLTON:</strong> Jaaskelainen; Hunt, Jaidi, N'Gotty, Gardner; Speed, Okocha, Nolan (Pedersen 71), Giannakopoulos; Davies, Diouf (Hierro 81). <strong> Subs not used:</strong> Poole, Ferdinand, Fadiga. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match:</strong> Pedro Mendes - always involved and covered every blade of grass. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> C Foy - handled the game very well.</p>",
  "<p> <strong>Scorpio 24 Oct-21</strong><br> Nov Problematic relationships can be profitably revisited now and some kind of accommodation reached, even if it's of the you-go-your-way-I'll-go-mine variety. Blame, jealousy and victimhood have to be expunged from the equation first, however. The Scorpionic ability to resurrect your ambitions and love affairs, or simply to impose yourself, is strong over the next two months. This week, your social life is also humming sweetly. Stay connected. </p> <p><strong>Sagittarius 22 Nov-21 Dec</strong><br> Even though you're probably not fully in any information loop outside your own inner voice, advantage lies with your connections to other people. Professional networks, lobby groups, steering committees and suchlike offer a path to achievement and prosperity. Don't be a lone wolf (or any other creature), especially next weekend, when you're nicely linked up.</p> <p><strong>Capricorn 22 Dec-19 Jan</strong><br> Putting aside the good cop/bad cop routine that's going on at work, the season of Scorpio promises a more easeful month than you've just had. This week you can drum up support from colleagues and organisations to which you belong, although Thursday's lunar eclipse suggests that one project, person or even lover has probably to be abandoned. Lord knows you've tried but ...</p> <p><strong>Aquarius 20 Jan-19 Feb</strong><br> The Aquarian disposition is usually presented as too lofty to be concerned with money, but it's a hot topic in your horoscope, particularly how you share financial burdens. Pragmatism rules here, and in your work, which is under continual emphasis through to Christmas. If you want to float around being cool, sociable and fascinating, Saturday is all yours, preferably alongside a Libran or two.</p> <p><strong>Pisces 20 Feb-20 Mar</strong><br> As the past eight months has surely shown you, being the one out of step has its advantages. With the non-conformist planet Uranus once again highlighted in your sign, a contrary but inventive spirit is your ally this week. You know you're right. Talking of allies, Venus remains on hand (but not for long) to help you make some, whether it's strictly business or something more personal. Make that deal.</p> <p><strong>Aries 21 Mar-19 Apr</strong><br> Your drollest outlook is likely to prove your most useful midweek, when your personal planet, Mars, puts you on the spot - cue an inquisition by your best-loved other half, perhaps, or an impulsive attraction. With Venus also moving into opposition next weekend, the message is clear enough: make peace, not war. Thursday's lunar eclipse falls in your resources zone - just the moment for a cash machine to swallow your credit card.</p> <p><strong>Taurus 20 Apr-20 May</strong><br> Thursday's total lunar eclipse in your sign is an omen to ponder, suggesting a moment of completion and change, notably if your birthday falls around 24/25 April. For those of you long enough in the tooth, October 1985 (one complete Saros Cycle) is a helpful point of comparison. In any case, a Taurean full Moon and a well-sited Venus suggest an emotional week ahead.</p> <p><strong>Gemini 21 May-20 Jun</strong><br> Even Geminis, the soul of novelty, need routine - but not too much of it, thanks. Current alignments help you re-imagine your career path (an ongoing project this year) and simultaneously encourage the practical overhaul of your everyday routines. The heart-to-heart stuff remains where the real action lies, however, especially next weekend, when Venus arrives to charm the pants off you, or help you do the same to your fancy.</p> <p><strong>Cancer 21 Jun-22 Jul</strong><br> Now that planets are active in fellow water signs (Scorpio and Pisces), you're entering a dynamic couple of months where personal relations and bright ideas are concerned. (Work and property? Still devilishly hard work.) Still, as your planetary ruler, like, todally disappears at Thursday's eclipse, one particular pal might likewise pull a vanishing act. Good moment, on the other hand, to leave behind someone of whom you've had your fill.</p> <p><strong>Leo 23 Jul-22 Aug</strong><br> To reiterate, now that your personal planet (the Sun, natch) is at the root of our horoscope, it's time to purge your little house on the prairie of the knick-knacks and heirlooms that attach you unnecessarily to the past (we're talking feng shui basics). Feel free to throw out the odd unwanted flatmate while you're at it. Busy week around the neighbourhood otherwise, with a socially oriented Saturday. </p> <p><strong>Virgo 23 Aug-22 Sep</strong><br> For once, your attention doesn't seem to be entirely on your work and task sheet. Your horoscope, at least, has other ideas - wining, dining, cooking, gardening, perhaps even the arts of love (even Virgos are known to engage in them). With your ruling planet, Mercury, moving swiftly, you'll doubtless be on innumerable missions, but even these seem less born of necessity than run for your own pleasure. Go on, 'fess up.</p> <p><strong>Libra 23 Sep-23 Oct</strong><br> As Jupiter the money planet is surging through your sign, you should at least be feeling more prosperous. Still, as Thursday's lunar eclipse falls in the sector of your 'scope concerned with shared wealth, you might like to check your mortgage arrangements, and that your cache of exquisite emeralds is where you left it. Venus, your planet, arrives on Friday to hand you a perfectly poised social weekend. Wardrobe!</p>",
  "<p><strong> WHAT DO WIGAN</strong> have in common with Arsenal? More than you might think, actually. Wigan boast the league's only other unbeaten record this season, a clear lead at the top of the table, and they score for fun and destroy opponents with lightning attacks launched from any part of the pitch. And they might soon be playing Manchester United. </p> <p>Of course there are certain dissimilarities, too. It is a long time since Highbury rocked to Tony Christie's Amarillo as a pre-match crowd warmer and, on the subject of crowds, it is fairly obvious that Wigan have no immediate need of a move to a larger stadium. </p> <p>Paul Jewell gets understandably upset when the question of Wigan's modest gates is raised, believing his side deserve bigger audiences but not wanting to criticise the loyal supporters who do come through the turnstile. It is all to do with ancient pride and prejudice, but now the domestic season has ended, the town's rugby lovers could do worse than check out the Latics. They never objected to Ellery Hanley and Co winning all their matches by a mile, and John Monie, the ultra-successful Australian in charge at Central Park a decade ago, would even let opponents know the gameplan. 'It's quite simple,' he used to say. 'We're going to run all over you and see how you stand up to it.' </p> <p>Wigan Athletic have been doing that to opponents all season, with talented midfielders like Jimmy Bullard and Lee McCulloch transferring the ball quickly and efficiently forward to allow Nathan Ellington and Jason Roberts to wreak havoc with Championship defences. They were not at their best here, misplacing too many passes and never approaching the levels of slickness displayed against Crewe in midweek, but in part that was due to the spikiness of Peter Reid's Coventry. </p> <p>Despite a well organised defensive line, the visitors found themselves a goal down after 15 minutes, when Alan Mahon thumped in a half-cleared free-kick from the edge of the box. Undaunted, Coventry continued to hustle Wigan into mistakes and kept going forward. Eddie Johnson gained a deserved reward after half an hour when he slipped his marker to nod home from Michael Doyle's free-kick. Rohan Ricketts even missed a chance to put Coventry ahead before the interval, finishing in a way that suggested the biggest difference between high-flying Latics and opponents who have not won in the league since August might be confidence. </p> <p>Wigan's response was to step up the pressure at the start of the second half, securing the points in a 10-minute purple patch. After a wave of swarming attacks, David Wright's cross produced a Roberts shot that Luke Steele could only get one hand to and David Graham had little difficulty in stabbing in a close-range rebound. Ellington headed narrowly wide on 55 minutes but found the net eight minutes later, hanging in the air to meet Bullard's corner for his 11th goal of the season after Steele had tipped Mahon's rising drive behind. The contest ended when Steve Staunton was dismissed 10 minutes from time for illegally halting Roberts' run into the area, even though the striker carelessly wafted the penalty over the bar, and the rout was com plete when substitute Mike Flynn scored with a glancing header in stoppage time. </p> <p>'Goals change games, and we gave too many away too easily,' Reid said. 'We were the better team in the first half, but Wigan have got the best two strikers at this level.' His fellow Scouser Jewell did not disagree. 'We've scored eight goals this week but we can't play well all the time,' the Wigan manager said. 'The first half wasn't brilliant but at least we reacted well and played some good stuff in the second.' </p> <p>There were jeers from Coventry's handful of travelling fans when the attendance was announced, but before Wigan attract any more resentment, a couple of myths can be nailed. First, this is not extravagance on the Jack Walker scale. JJB Sports founder Dave Whelan is much more the public-spirited but thrifty Victorian mill-owner type. Earlier in the week, Jew ell was down to a squad of only 16 fit professionals. Second, the JJB Stadium does not sell out every week for rugby matches. Only derbies with St Helens or crunch matches against Bradford threaten the 25,000 capacity, and in bread-and-butter games even the egg-chasers have been known to complain of a lack of atmosphere. Where and how this story ends is not clear, but a chapter set in the Premiership seems increasingly likely. </p> <p> <strong> WIGAN</strong> </p> <p>Filan; Wright, Breckin, Jackson, Baines; Graham, Bullard, Mahon, McCulloch; Roberts, Ellington (Flynn 89). </p> <p><strong> Subs not used:</strong> Walsh, Mitchell, McMillan, Whalley. </p> <p><strong> COVENTRY</strong> </p> <p>Steele; Carey, Staunton, Shaw, Leacock; Hughes, Doyle, Morrell (McSheffrey 86), Ricketts (Gudjonsson 74); Johnson, John (Suffo 86). </p> <p><strong> Subs not used:</strong> Shearer, Deloumeaux. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> P Crossley.</p>",
  "<p>To understand the national lottery's impact on British society over the past decade, you need to see beyond a morass of noughts. You need to see beyond the \u00a316 billion the draw has raised for more than 180,000 good causes. You need to see beyond the 1,600 millionaires created since the game began; the two million people who win a prize every week, even if it is only a tenner for getting three numbers right; the 20,000 blue plaques being screwed onto walls to commemorate a local project that has received lottery funding. </p> <p>No, to even begin to get a handle on the largest programme of civic regeneration since the 19th century, it helps if you focus on just one project which owes its genesis to the national draw. </p> <p>Don't go to one of the flagship projects that have garnered the headlines. Do not go to the hugely popular Eden Project in Cornwall (\u00a353 million of lottery cash) which has generated \u00a3500m for Cornwall's tourist industry; do not go to the acclaimed Tate Modern (\u00a357.7m); do not go to the giant white elephant that is the Millennium Dome (\u00a3628m); do not go to the Royal Opera House (\u00a375.5m), the funding of which turned into a public relations disaster and raised fears the lottery was simply a tax on the poor to benefit the rich; do not go to see the inchoate exoskeleton of the controversial new Wembley stadium (\u00a3120m) rising above the north London skyline. Instead head for Coventry. </p> <p>What the Luftwaffe's incendiary bombs started in the Midlands city over 60 years ago, the invisible hand of market forces very nearly completed. As the big car firms shut down in the 1970s, Coventry stagnated and unemployment soared. The city came to resemble a concrete jungle, a mish-mash of brutal architecture, all car parks and office blocks. Civic pride suffered. The Specials wrote a song on Coventry's sad decline: 'Ghost Town'. </p> <p>Today, Coventry's centre has been regenerated thanks to lottery cash. Its critically acclaimed Phoenix Initiative, which has enjoyed \u00a310m of lottery funding from the Millennium Commission, links a series of public squares and gardens via a series of art installations, waterfalls and a spiralling glass bridge. They blend to produce a futuristic urban space the envy of any city in the world. </p> <p>There are trees with built-in speakers out of which the ghostly voices of locals recount the city's history. There is a wall of tiny, personalised red plaques, each depicting an individual friendship of two people in the city. Framing the project are two huge criss-crossing metal wings - which come together to create the Whittle arch in memory of one of the city's most famous sons, Sir Frank Whittle, inventor of the jet engine. </p> <p>The entire project, connecting the ruins of Coventry's 11th-century cathedral to its motor museum, cost around \u00a350m in total and would not have happened without lottery cash which helped secure 'matching' funding from other bodies, chiefly the European Development Fund. </p> <p>'Getting lottery money is important, because it pulls in other money. It makes a vital contribution. The scheme would not have been achievable without lot tery funding,' says John McGuigan, director of development at the city council. Last weekend the project narrowly lost out to London's Swiss Re building - aka the Gherkin - in the race for the Stirling Prize for architecture. </p> <p>True, some locals grumble the scheme is too 'metropolitan' and say the council should have spent the cash on something less 'challenging'. But what both pros and antis agree is that countless projects would never have happened if it had been left to cautious politicians jealously guarding the taxpayers' coffers. </p> <p>Put simply, the national lottery's most significant impact on society is the way it has allowed people to take creative risks inconceivable 10 years ago. Some risks have backfired spectacularly. The defunct Faith Centre in Bradford and the Pop Music Centre in Sheffield are examples of bad ideas badly executed. But all allowed local people to dream. As McGuigan admits about the Phoenix Initiative: 'We're making a statement. You either love it or you loathe it.' The same could be said of the lottery. </p> <p>Football hooliganism and the late philanthropist Paul Getty have not, until now, been credited as the progenitors of the national lottery. But without the Heysel stadium tragedy and the deep pockets of one of Britain's richest men, it is unlikely the national draw would be celebrating its 10th anniversary on 6 November. That it is doing so owes much to the Australian-born composer, Denis Vaughan. Sitting in his Covent Garden apartment surrounded by piles of papers documenting his quest to launch a national draw, Vaughan, 77, looks an unlikely champion of a low-brow pastime regularly played by seven out of 10 adults. </p> <p>Tall, with a shock of white hair, Vaughan, a friend of Getty, seems every inch the internationally respected conductor he is. But it was his time spent conducting in cities around the world - chiefly in Australia and Germany, where national lotteries have funded many cultural institutions - that drew him to the idea of a national lottery. And then came Heysel. In May 1985, 39 Juventus fans died when a wall collapsed during fighting on the terraces at a match against Liverpool. English clubs were banned from Europe for five years. </p> <p>'I was in Italy and my friends said to me: \"It's because the English don't know any better\",' Vaughan recalls. The criticism set him thinking about ways of tackling hooliganism. His solution was a cultural renaissance, driven by an arts-based lottery fund capable of transforming the lives of young people. Backed by Getty's money, Vaughan was soon lobbying the government. </p> <p>To give his proposals gravitas, he published a paper in conjunction with the Adam Smith Institute, the right-leaning think-tank, in which he advanced his pet theory, linking the causes of violence to rock music. </p> <p>'More civilised pursuits are needed which enjoy the ubiquity of rock,' he said. If his ideas about the origins of hooliganism were left-field, Vaughan's central proposition - the need for a national lottery - had a growing appeal among politicians. But there was one snag. Margaret Thatcher was implaccably opposed. The shopkeeper's daughter thought there was something obscene about people being rewarded simply because they were lucky. </p> <p>The Iron Lady's departure gave Vaughan new hope. He needed a champion within the Tory party, and he found one in Sir Ivan Lawrence. Now a QC, Lawrence was the trenchantly right-wing MP for Burton until the 1997 election and is proud of his long-forgotten role in helping create the national lottery. An enthusiastic player of the lottery himself, Lawrence jokes about what his wife would say if she won millions of pounds. Lawrence would turn to his now unfeasibly rich wife and say: 'Darling, would you still love me?' The reply? 'Of course.' Pause. 'But I'd miss you.' </p> <p>In 1991 Lawrence found himself a popular man. His name had been drawn first out of the private members' bill ballot and there was no shortage of senior ministers urging him to take up their cause. But Vaughan's lottery zeal won Lawrence round. 'If ever anybody requires an honour for services to the national lottery, it's him. Denis conducted a non-stop campaign. Sometimes I had to say to him, \"Calm down,\" when he was briefing ministers,' Lawrence recalls. </p> <p>Lawrence's private members' bill did not introduce the national lottery; not enough MPs supported it in the end. But the idea had excited the media and the public overwhelmingly backed the plan. A creaking administration under John Major, out to impress a jaded electorate, made the lottery a 1992 manifesto commitment. But though the lottery may be remembered as Major's legacy to Britain he was not a passionate advocate for it. 'I saw him quite often but he never said, \"Good luck with your bill\". He wasn't wildly enthusiastic,' Lawrence recalls. Both Lawrence and Vaughan have reservations about the direction the lottery has taken since its launch. Lawrence cites the \u00a3340,000 grant that went to an asylum seeker's anti-deportation group as evidence the lottery's distribution agencies are out of step with public opinion. Vaughan says not enough of the lottery money has gone on the arts and sport. Unless this changes, Vaughan says, society is 'doomed'. </p> <p>Peter Davis has taken a vow of silence for the past seven years. As the first Director-General of Oflot, the watchdog set up to monitor the national draw, Davis was caught up in a very public storm right from the beginning of the lottery and has been left bruised by his experiences. An accountant by training, he was ill prepared for the way the lottery became an overtly political institution as the reality of its influence over society dawned on ministers. </p> <p>In 1994 it was Davis's job to select the consortium to run the lottery out of eight interested bidders, including a number of gambling chains, a Richard Branson-led bid and Camelot, the eventual winner. Davis is still angry over what he sees as the hijacking of the lottery by politicians. 'I underestimated the extent to which the national lottery, despite being successfully established and operated, would later become a target for politically motivated sniping and criticism,' Davis says in a thinly veiled attack on the Labour government. </p> <p>Things got ugly for Davis in 1998 during a libel case between Branson and Guy Snowden, chief executive of the US gambling giant G-Tech, Camelot's technology partner. During the court case an old story that Davis had flown on a plane funded by G-Tech - several months after the licence had been awarded - resurfaced. Davis was forced to resign by the government, which claimed the public had lost confidence in him as a result. </p> <p>His scalp was a coup for an administration which saw him as a Tory appointment, someone who had resisted the New Labour-backed idea of a not-for-profit lottery and a regulator that had done little to curb the 'fat cat' salaries paid to Camelot's directors which had risen by an average 40 per cent in the three years since the lottery's launch. It underlined the fact that the lottery had become a powerful institution that the government was desperate to control. </p> <p>Davis is still proud of his role in the lottery's inception: 'It quickly established itself as an accepted part of the nation's way of life.' Indeed it did. When the first draw took place on 19 November 1994, some \u00a346m worth of tickets were sold, thanks to a wave of hype. It was estimated that the famous 'It could be you' adverts had been seen an average 13 times by 40 million adults before a ball had been drawn. The first time there was a double rollover, 96 per cent of the adult population bought a ticket. </p> <p>Almost inevitably, given the British psyche, the 'curse of the lottery' became a regular story. The lottery's first mega millionaire, Mukhtar Mohidin, who won \u00a317.9m, was racked with guilt because, as a Muslim, his religion banned gambling. Six months later Paul Maddison, who with a friend scooped \u00a322.5m, the largest single ticket jackpot so far, split up with his wife, Ruth. The following year Ernie Bailey, who won \u00a311m, was found dead, prompting suggestions the lottery win had caused him to binge on drink and food. Colin Sampson, who won \u00a35.4m, told a court that the pressure of wealth and fame had led him to cultivate cannabis. Last month Michael Carroll, 21, a former bin man who won \u00a39.7m, said part of him wished he had never won the lottery after admitting blowing \u00a3500,000 on crack cocaine and cannabis binges, which cost him his marriage. </p> <p>The biggest winner, though, has no complaints. The Treasury has earned some \u00a35bn in lottery duty, in addition to the \u00a316bn raised for good causes. </p> <p>The range of good causes that have had funding provides sociologists with an interesting take on the predilections of British society in the 21st century. </p> <p>At the small-scale level they range from a \u00a33,000 grant to help Scottish beekeepers guard hives against a potentially fatal bloodsucking mite to a \u00a36,000 handout which has ensured that Wales's smallest cinema, a 23-seat auditorium in a converted railway carriage near Swansea, stays open. </p> <p>At the medium scale, they range from a \u00a370,000 windfall to fund PsychologyOnline, which allows people to receive therapy over the internet, to a \u00a3200,000 grant to a university professor hoping to find the best form of public transport for the 21st century, and a \u00a3100,000 windfall to help scientists use stem cell research to grow new teeth. Large projects range from \u00a357m to improve facilities at Stonehenge to grants totalling over \u00a3110m to the British film industry. Lottery-funded films include the acclaimed Touching The Void and the widely panned Sex Lives Of The Potato Men. </p> <p>There were rows. Over a computer glitch that meant lottery players received the wrong prize money. Over the number of people who stopped playing the lottery, a natural decline that has afflicted all lotteries around the world. Over the launch of scratch-cards which were criticised for encouraging gambling. Over the BBC's obsession with a 'lottery programme' which critics said bordered on breaching its charter on not advertising commercial organisations. </p> <p>Today it appears both Camelot and the lottery itself have weathered the storm. The fat cats have moved on, G-Tech's contract has been bought out, and overall sales are up. A host of new games has stimulated interest and playing the game via mobile phones and on the internet attracted new punters. Britain's national lottery is arguably the most successful in the world, and polls show overwhelming public support for it. </p> <p>But whether the lottery can prevent a decline in sales in the long term is debatable. Studies show the public loses interest as the years tick by, no matter how many new games are introduced. And soon it faces a new threat: the imminent deregulation of the gambling laws. This, the lottery's critics maintain, is a direct consequence of the way the national draw has transformed society's attitude to gambling, making everyone more amenable to the idea of a flutter. </p> <p>As the lottery's original advert suggested: 'It could be you.' Ten years on, for better or for worse, millions still agree.</p> <p><strong>Highs and lows in the political lottery</strong></p> <p><strong>GUY SNOWDEN: </strong>Former chief executive of G-Tech, whose technology powers Camelot's terminals. Forced to resign after losing a libel action brought by Richard Branson, who accused Snowden of trying to bribe him. The case forced G-Tech out of the Camelot consortium, but, despite the fall out, Snowden walked away with a \u00a39.3 million pay off. </p> <p><strong>DIANNE THOMPSON: </strong>Feisty chief executive of Camelot who won respect for seeing off Richard Branson during his bid to win the lottery licence at the second attempt. A Yorkshire woman who stands five feet tall, Thompson once described herself as having 'balls of steel'. Earned \u00a3608,000 including pension and bonus payments last year. Controversially, given Camelot's attempts to throw off its fat cat image, Thompson pocketed \u00a3600,000 in bonuses when she assumed the chief executive role after beating Branson to the second licence.</p> <p><strong>Where the money went</strong> </p> <p><strong>Three cheers for ...</strong> </p> <p><strong>The Angel of the North:</strong> Antony Gormley's soaring figure on the hills above Gateshead, built between 1995 and 1998, received \u00a3584,000 in lottery funding, and has become a potent symbol of Northern optimism. </p> <p><strong>Olympic medal glory:</strong> The Lottery has allowed some 550 sportsmen and women, in 35 Olympic and Paralympic sports, to concentrate full-time on chasing medals. They get up to \u00a312,000 a year for living costs, plus up to \u00a350,000 a year to cover massage, coaching and transport. </p> <p><strong>Tate Modern:</strong> The disused power station at Bankside, on the south side of the Thames, was redesigned with \u00a350m of lottery cash and has become an art gallery representing a new commitment to the visual arts. </p> <p><strong>New facilities:</strong> The bulk of the \u00a33bn of lottery money in sport has gone into refurbishing facilities.

  "The government forced around 100 Somali asylum seekers to leave the UK in the first half of this year, many sent back to their war-torn country despite warnings from the Somali government and the United Nations that such action would endanger lives. <p>The figures, revealed in an official letter from Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart to Liberal Democrat peer Lord Avebury, will raise serious questions about the government's immigration policy. </p> <p>Somalia is considered one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Warring militias control much of the southern part of the country, including the capital, Mogadishu. Between April and June this year more than 100 civilians were killed and thousands of others were forced to flee their homes, according to Amnesty International. </p> <p>Emma Ginn, of the National Coalition Anti-Deportation Campaign, said: 'There have been numerous reports highlighting how unsafe the situation is in parts of Somalia. The government cannot have been unaware of the grave situation that confronts asylum seekers once they arrive back in the country.' </p> <p>The unrest has sparked an exodus of Somalians who now make up the single biggest source of asylum applications to Britain. Last year, nearly 4,600 Somalians sought asylum in the UK and the government has made 'fast tracking' their applications a priority. </p> <p>Earlier this year it quietly introduced a new policy of enforcing the removal of failed Somalian asylum seekers, which prompted alarm from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. </p> <p>In her letter to Avebury, Mactaggart reveals that 55 Somali nationals were removed from the UK under the government's 'enforced returns' programme in the second quarter of this year. She acknowledges a similar number were removed over the first quarter of 2004. The policy has been temporarily suspended because Daallo Airlines, which flies asylum seekers into Somalia from Dubai, has now refused to accept enforced returns for reasons that are unclear.</p>",
  "The answer to why the government is investing precious parliamentary time in introducing dozens of mega-casinos lies in a windswept resort on America's eastern seaboard. <p>In the last four years, ministers have enjoyed junkets staying in smart hotels investigating the effects of gambling in Australia, South Africa and the United States. </p> <p>A stop-off on the tour is Atlantic City. Once a playground for New York and Boston city slickers, it suffered when cheap air travel lured many Americans to Florida. With high unemployment afflicting the city, it turned to gambling as a panacea. But when Atlantic City became America's second major gambling venue, after Las Vegas, in the 1970s, few benefited other than the casino owners. That was until a new tax was introduced in 1984, requiring casinos to pay 1.25 per cent towards social projects and affordable housing. It made a difference and although today Atlantic City still has social problems and a higher than average gambling addiction rate, it is a city much improved. </p> <p>Ministers such as Lord Andrew Macintosh, who is overseeing the gambling bill for the government, have been impressed by a number of affordable housing projects built in the city on gambling taxation and new youth centre facilities. </p> <p>The regeneration argument put forward by casino bosses such as Peter Byrne, the executive director of the South African gambling giant Sun International, claims it could lead to the 'wholesale transformation of areas'. </p> <p>'If the government gets this right, the regions will receive a golden opportunity to take advantage of the immense benefits that come with the development of a major casino - typically including a \u00a3100m investment and 1,500 new jobs,' Byrne claims. </p> <p>The template for the government's thinking was laid out by free marketeer Sir Alan Budd. The former chief economic adviser to the Thatcher government set out proposals three years ago that would allow the business to decide how many casinos would be developed. </p> <p>Budd set a barrier to entry. Any casino that wanted jackpot slot machines had to have a gambling floor area of at least 5,000 sq ft to limit building. But there are now 100 plans waiting for approval. </p> <p>A source close to Tessa Jowell, the Culture Secretary, confirmed that the original assumption was that the number of casinos would be dictated by the market. </p> <p>The casino legislation was also an afterthought. The overarching intention of the bill published last week was to set up a Gambling Commission to regulate internet gambling. Gambling laws are 36 years old and have been superseded by technology. Criminals use unregulated sites to launder money. </p> <p>By regulating the internet, the government hoped to make Britain a hub for the industry. It was opportunism from gambling bosses that persuaded Jowell to legislate for casinos as well. </p> <p>But all this is threatened. As a Whitehall source said: 'Now the cat's out of the bag ministers are rushing to catch up. The bill won't survive in its present state.'</p>",
  "He is the man appointed by Tony Blair to protect the public from poisonous chemicals. Yet the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, has admitted that his body contains a cocktail of toxic substances, many of which have been banned on safety grounds for decades. <p>The minister agreed to have the results of his blood test published to make people aware of the issue of pollutants and chemicals contained in everyday items such as sofas, cosmetics, mattresses and televisions. </p> <p>Tests on the enthusiastic hill-walker and keen supporter of organic food detected 33 hazardous man-made compounds in his blood, including pesticides, flame retardants and industrial plastics. </p> <p>What is worrying campaigners is that more than 90 per cent of these have been banned, some as long ago as the 1970s, after being linked to cancer, immune-system disorders and neurological problems. </p> <p>The findings have been described as proof that no one is safe from the build-up of harmful chemicals in the environment, even if the actual contamination occurred decades ago. </p> <p>The precise health implications remain unknown because many of the chemicals have never been tested on humans. In addition, a method for calculating the cocktail effects of chemicals once they are in the bloodstream has yet to be devised. </p> <p>Michael admitted that his results served as evidence that everybody in Britain was being exposed to chemical contamination, but said the levels were extremely low and should not be a cause for immediate alarm. 'It does demonstrate the range of chemicals to which we are exposed,' he added. </p> <p>Sir Tom Blundell, the biochemist appointed by Tony Blair to chair the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, warned that Michael's results would fuel a growing consensus that the prevalence of untested chemicals in the environment could become a major public health issue. Blundell said he had repeatedly warned ministers that the issue could become the 'next tobacco'. </p> <p>'We are conducting a huge experiment on ourselves and I am not surprised that a large number of chemi cals have accumulated in the tissues of Mr Michael,' he said. </p> <p>One of the substances found in the minister's body belongs to a family of chemicals including perfluorooctane sulphonate, used in chrome plating and fire-fighting foam, which the minister banned only last Tuesday. </p> <p>Announcing his decision to start phasing out the chemical, which has linked to bladder cancer, Michael described it as a substance that 'presents a real and significant risk to the health of the population and the environment in the UK. I am concerned that a substance with these intrinsic properties is still used.' </p> <p>Sixty milligrams of blood were taken from Michael and analysed for 103 industrial substances linked to health concerns. He agreed to undertake the tests in order to raise the issue at a time when Britain is pushing for tighter regulation. </p> <p>Blundell believes the government must act quickly if it is to sidestep litigation. 'The health of millions could be affected by these chemicals and there could be some very serious outcomes. At the moment it remains very difficult to prove the relationship between cause and affect, but that could change,' he warned. </p> <p>Dr Vyvyan Howard, a toxicologist at Liverpool University and a member of the government's advisory committee on pesticides, said: 'Asbestos was known to be bad in about the 1900s, but it still took 60 or 70 years to stop its use. People are going to die in the next 20 years because of decisions already taken.' Although the levels of contaminants in the minister's blood were small, Howard said they could 'hijack the development' of a foetus. </p> <p>Elizabeth Salter-Green, chemical campaigner for environmental pressure group WWF, which organised the tests on the minister, said: 'If Alun Michael was a pregnant mother, it is not unreasonable to assume there could be effects on the foetus. The fact their health effects are completely unknown is ridiculous in the 21st century.' </p> <p>Other chemicals in the blood of the former marathon runner included polychlorinated biphenyls, which have been banned over concerns that they could cause infertility. </p> <p>'We know that in animals some of these substances increase the incidence of cancer,' Howard said.</p> <p>'Temporally and biologically, it is plausible these chemicals may play a role.' </p> <p>Chemical firms reject claims they are poisoning people and Department of Health officials who examined Michael's results told him there was 'no evidence that such trace amounts have adverse effects on health'. Such guidance has angered experts who claim that government officials had no evidence to substantiate these claims. </p> <p>Legislation on the chemicals industry is under consideration by the European Commission, a move that would place the onus on the industry to prove that the everyday use of 30,000 substances is safe. Britain has taken a lead on pushing through the proposals, according to Michael, and has pulled together both environmental groups and industry to agree on a new testing procedure for toxic substances. </p> <p>However, the plans will have to survive lobbying from US interests. A confidential memo seen by The Observer reveals how the US has campaigned aggressively against any crackdown on the industry, arguing it would affect the \u00a320 billion of chemicals that America exports to Europe each year.</p>",
  "<p>Increasing numbers of people are turning to private slimming clubs as a way of shedding the pounds, disillusioned with radical carb-free diets and expensive gym memberships. </p> <p>It is estimated that more than 100,000 people this year will have joined clubs where they have to check in once a week for medical advice, help and support as a last-ditch attempt to lose weight. </p> <p>Some clubs use controversial appetite suppressants alongside the usual dietary advice. Others provide clients with all the food they will need for a week as a way of helping them avoid the temptations laid out in supermarkets. </p> <p>Britain faces an obesity epidemic and John Reid, the Health Secretary, is to make recommendations in a White Paper on public health to tackle it. Private clinics hope to be included in the equation, so that GPs could prescribe a course in a registered clinic on the NHS as a cost-effective and efficient way of helping those seriously overweight. </p> <p>The White Paper will also address the problem in children, among whom obesity rates have trebled in the past two decades. The proposals will spell out that young children at risk of being overweight must be identified by health professionals so that their families can be given advice on how to keep them fit and healthy. </p> <p>Health visitors will be asked to help identify the toddlers who appear to be putting on too much weight for their age, and this will then be monitored. Later, it will fall to school nurses to pick out the children facing serious health problems because of their size, and liaise with their families. There will also be a telephone helpline to give parents advice on how to give their kids a more active lifestyle. </p> <p>Obesity is estimated to cost the UK up to \u00a37.4 billion a year and will soon supersede tobacco as the single greatest cause of premature death. It is related to serious conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, strokes and some cancers. </p> <p>By the time a girl reaches adulthood, her risk of a heart attack if she is obese is three times greater than that of a slimmer woman. Adults who are seriously overweight have a threefold increase in the risk of cancer of the colon. </p> <p>Private companies claim that they should be central to the government's attempts to tackle the crisis. Although there are few published statistics to show their effect on long-term weight loss, the companies claim to be highly successful at helping people who have tried countless diets and failed to lose the pounds. Many patients say the weight stays off if they change their lifestyles to become fitter. </p> <p>Some of the groups such as WeightWatchers and Slimming World have offered to give three-monthly courses at a reduced rate on the NHS. However, to qualify for free help the patients would probably have to be seriously overweight at the start. </p> <p>There are concerns that doctors may send patients to classes that have a lower success rate than others. Specialists want to see more controls in the sector so that clubs have to produce long-term evidence that patients who lose a lot of weight are supported afterwards, instead of being left to carry on with no help. </p> <p>There are also concerns about whether private clubs should prescribe drugs for patients. National Slimming Centres, which has 35 branches across the UK, uses the appetite suppressant phentermine, a drug which can only be given to clinically obese patients whose body mass index is greater than 30, and is prescribed by GPs who work privately for the centres. The clinics have 250,000 patient visits a year, with the average patient visiting five times a year. The centres' founder, Robert Houtman, said the drug had been given a bad press undeservedly and that it helped thousands every year to reach a healthier weight. </p> <p>'I'm only interested in what works,' he said. 'It's very hard for many clients to find the willpower that they need to lose that weight, and this medication is really effective. They still eat healthily, they can take in 850 calories a day, and their weight goes down, which is a huge health benefit for them.' </p> <p>Houtman believes the NHS does not have the capacity or expertise to help the patients he sees each day. 'GPs would like to do more, but don't have the time to spend with patients. It would be lovely if the NHS could send patients to us, but that's as likely as me becoming Prime Minister.' </p> <p>Patients have to be carefully monitored during the course of drug therapy. The two drugs most commonly prescribed by GPs are sibutramine, whose brand name is Reductil, and orlistat (Xenical) which work in different ways but have good weight loss records. </p> <p>In the past two years, 10 Healthier Weight Centres, run by Dr David Ashton, have sprung up around England. These centres, which focus on changing the lifestyle of overweight clients, pro vide a weekly bag of groceries for each person so they can avoid the temptation of supermarket food. </p> <p>Ashton said: 'I set up these centres because I didn't think that obese people, who can be very vulnerable, were really getting the help they needed. It is very, very difficult to lose a lot of weight, and you need to give them an enormous amount of support, but also a lot of education about how to become active and eat nutritious food. There is no quick fix.'</p>",
  "<p>What is it about the drinks industry that makes them look soft targets for governments seeking a bit of voter popularity? Margaret Thatcher took on the brewing industry towards the end of her time, and produced the Beer Orders, which were meant to free the pub trade from the grip of what used to be called the 'Beerage'. In fact, they wrecked the UK business, to the point where virtually the whole industry is foreign-owned. The drinks companies changed strategy and moved on, adapting to survive in the post-Beer Orders climate. Pubs became more sophisticated, family-friendly places, where you could eat decent food as well as get a drink. On the whole, they were a lot better than the 'boozers' of old, with their 'blokey and smokey' image. </p> <p>The health legislation being proposed by the government - or at least that part of it happy to be called 'New' Labour - is once again focusing on the drinks companies for a few cheap votes. The plan is to ban smoking in pubs that serve hot food, which seems pretty sensible and straightforward, but which could be as disastrous as anything Thatcher did. </p> <p>The economics of the industry suggest that the outcome could be the opposite of what the government intends. About 24 per cent of average pub sales come from food, but this is comparatively low-margin business. Preparing and serving food costs a lot more than pulling a pint. </p> <p>So if pubs have to choose between losing low margin food customers or high margin smokers, many will choose the latter. So welcome back the smokey old boozers of old, serving a packet of crisps and a bag of peanuts. </p> <p>The drinks industry has put up its own compromise, which is a gradual move towards pubs that are 80 per cent non-smoking by 2009. This is not enough for the 'hizbollah tendency' in the health department, who want to ban all smoking. You can only hope that the sanity of old gaspers like John Reid will prevail when the white paper is finally unveiled, probably in the next few weeks.</p>",
  "John Rennie, a 60-year-old cafe worker with angina, chronic back pain and diabetes, prided himself on being a slow and careful driver. When his erratic braking on the streets of Carlisle led to an angry confrontation with another driver, former rugby player Jamie Hughes, 30, Rennie was certain that it would only be a matter of time before he was attacked. <p>Grabbing the knife he always kept in his car, Rennie pulled over and got out. When Hughes stopped his car, Rennie walked over and plunged the four-inch blade into the younger man's heart. </p> <p>'I was pushed to the limit and I was really scared,' Rennie explained after he was arrested. 'The guy was shouting and going on and gesturing and I thought that if he saw the knife he would maybe back down. A guy of his size following me, he was not going to stop. I wanted to scare him off.' </p> <p>Thanks to emergency surgery, Hughes survived. Last week Rennie, who had no prior convictions and was described by those who knew him as 'old fashioned' and 'mild mannered', was jailed for three years after being found guilty of unlawful wounding. </p> <p>The case comes at a time when police forces across the country are experiencing a dramatic increase in knife crime. Government figures show that offences involving the possession of offensive weapons, the vast majority of which are knives, have risen by 36 per cent since 1999. Murders involving sharp instruments rose from 200 in 1997 to 272 in 2003. </p> <p>The problem is particularly acute in London, where an internal report by the Metropolitan police found that a crime involving a knife takes place every 25 minutes. A 5 per cent rise in violent crime in the capital has been blamed almost entirely on an increase in the number of muggers and burglars arming themselves with knives. </p> <p>Last week Robert Symons, a 45-year-old father-of-two, died from a single stab wound to the heart after confronting a burglar in the kitchen of his home in Chiswick, west London. Detectives have found a kitchen knife which they believe to be the murder weapon. Forensic tests have yet to establish whether the intruder grabbed it from the family's kitchen or had it when he entered the house. </p> <p>There were 14,110 knife offences in London between June 2003 and March this year. Most offenders are aged between 12 and 20 but these figures mask the fact that many older people are also carrying and using knives. One in five knife attacks involves an offender over the age of 25. Senior police officers admit that statistics on the ages of those who carry knives are biased towards the younger generation, as older men are less likely to be stopped and searched. </p> <p>Commander Simon Foy, head of the Met's anti-knife campaign, Operation Blunt, said: 'We are well aware that there is a problem with older people carrying knives. It is not something we are complacent about but the focus of our efforts is the younger generation. We hope that in the future the introduction of specialist anti-knife patrols and the use of portable metal detectors that can distinguish between knives and other metallic objects will help to catch and ultimately deter all ages from carrying such weapons.' </p> <p>Nicholas, a 44-year-old engineer from Hertfordshire, is typical of this older generation of knife carriers. He rarely travels anywhere unless he is armed. 'It's a bit of extra security and makes me feel safe. When you get that bit older, you need something to even up the odds. I used to carry a lock-knife but now I carry a Leatherman multi-purpose tool. It has a four-inch blade but because of all the other bits that come with it I can claim I use it for work. Almost everyone I know does the same. If you get caught with a knife you risk getting a fine but with one of these you can get away with it.' </p> <p>Nicholas says he would not use his weapon other than to scare off a potential opponent but a report published last week by the Bridge House Trust on the spread of knife culture found that those who carry knives to defend themselves will often find themselves caught up in violence. </p> <p>'Some people are said to carry knives and other weapons to feel safer but with no intention of using them,' said the study. 'In fact, carrying a knife puts them at far greater risk of being stabbed or committing an aggressive act and being labelled an offender. While fear may be the motive, aggression may be the result.' </p> <p>There are many examples of older men's involvement in knife crime. In June, 42-year-old Patrick Hemmings was jailed for life after stabbing a 28-year-old man who had bumped into the back of his car. He knifed him through the heart with a 10-inch blade that he kept in his car for his own safety. </p> <p>In July, a 47-year-old man allegedly stabbed to death his younger male lover as the pair argued while driving along a sliproad of the M25. A few months earlier, 40-year-old Andrew Tolmie was jailed for four years after repeatedly stabbing a younger driver who flashed his lights to complain that Tolmie was driving while using a mobile phone. </p> <p>Knives are also finding fresh favour with the underworld, especially since the introduction of a five-year minimum sentence for anyone caught in possession of a firearm. The gangster-turned-author Horace Silver, 45, whose semi-autobiographical novel Judas Pig chronicles his time with a notorious East London firm, says knives are now regularly used in preference to other weapons, especially by older criminals. </p> <p>'If you shoot someone you know the police are going to look at it seriously and suspect gang involvement,' he said. 'If you stab someone, it often gets dismissed as a simple bar brawl or street fight. Using a knife is also a lot more personal so it's a way of sending a message to others.' </p> <p>Eager to cash in, major gun manufacturers including Kalashnikov, Glock, Heckler and Koch, Smith &amp; Wesson and Browning all now have extensive knife ranges. The booming market is aimed at enticing those living in countries where handguns are no longer legal to maintain loyalty to their favourite brand. An advertisement for the Kalashnikov KAL knife, price \u00a3180, states that it 'complements the style found in the original AK-47 assault rifle' and is 'synonymous with genius, strength and reliability'. </p> <p>The Bridge House Trust report found that these 'combat' knives have a particular appeal to young people. 'The pleasure of holding, possessing and brandishing what only the adult, brave and qualified soldier is allowed to carry legally is part of many young boys' childhood, whatever their social background,' said the report. 'In this sense knives are a \"link with adulthood\" for some children.' </p> <p>One of the most worrying aspects of knife culture uncovered by both the Met report and other studies is the startling ignorance about the damage a knife can do. Last month 59-year-old Edward Kitts of St Austell was jailed for five years after stabbing a young man to death during a scuffle over dog mess. Kitts stabbed the man with the eight-inch kitchen knife he habitually carried in his jacket, then walked home with his dog. </p> <p>It was only the next day when he heard a news bulletin saying that the man had died that Kitts realised the seriousness of what he had done and gave himself up. </p> <p>According to Foy, such ignorance is not uncommon. 'We often hear people say something along the lines of \"I only stabbed him a little bit\" or \"it was only a small knife\". Even the smallest of blades can cause the most horrific injuries and some of the complications that can result from seemingly shallow wounds can be extremely grave. Showing the truth about knife wounds is often the best way to put young people off carrying them.'</p>",
  "Victims of nuisance neighbours who give evidence against the people who make their lives a misery are to be given the same protection as witnesses in high-profile organised crime or rape trials. <p>The latest move in the drive against antisocial behaviour will allow members of the public to give evidence from behind screens in court or by video link seen only by magistrates. Ministers are concerned that people being terrorised by their neighbours are often too frightened to come forward due to fear of retribution. </p> <p>It will be the first time such witness protection measures have ever been used in civil rather than criminal proceedings. Antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos) handed out by magistrates are not criminal convictions but can lead to a prison sentence of up to five years if they are breached. They are used to stop persistently noisy neighbours, aggressive teenagers and petty criminals. Civil rights groups have complained that the burden of proof is lower than in the criminal courts. </p> <p>The new antisocial behaviour measures, to be announced by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, today, will be accompanied by the expansion of a network of antisocial behaviour courts, run by specialist prosecutors, from 12 to more than 40 by the end of next month. </p> <p>Falconer is expected to say: 'We must do all we can to give people the confidence to tackle antisocial behaviour in their communities. I am not prepared to see law-abiding citizens intimidated from giving evidence.' </p> <p>But ministers were accused last night of scaremongering by civil rights organisation Liberty. Spokesman Barry Hugill said: 'If there is a genuine need, witnesses need to be protected. But this is part of the hysteria being whipped up by the government, who would have us believe that we are being swept by a wave of young criminals making it unsafe to walk the streets. This is simply not true.' </p> <p>The news comes as Manchester City Council provoked outrage among homelessness campaigners last night by applying for anti-social behaviour orders to sweep Christian charity soup kitchens off the streets. </p> <p>Manchester - dubbed 'The 'Asbo Capital of Britain' after it applied for 300 Asbos - has decided to target beggars and street sleepers because of the litter left after the mobile soup runs. Manchester City Centre Management Company and the city council now want to put the soup kitchens into permanent buildings. </p> <p>Trevor Lee, of the Christian charity The Mustard Tree, said: 'They are targeting people that they believe come to the city for the soup runs. But we are committed to going where the poor are. The council wants Manchester to be a trouble-free zone. But it will always be a problem while we have the poor.' </p> <p>The move is the latest by the council to increase the use of Asbos. One order prohibited Peter Broadbent from sleeping rough after he was found lying among needles in the street. Leonard Hockey, a beggar with a crack and heroin habit, was banned from asking for money in the city. He later died in prison after breaching the order. </p> <p>The Asbo crackdown has also targeted prostitutes. One woman accused of accosting men and making a nuisance of herself was prohibited from carrying condoms in the area she worked. She is now in prison for breaching the order after a drug clinic provided her with condoms as part of its harm reduction strategy </p> <p>As The Observer first reported in July, new legislation will also give new powers to local communities to 'trigger' Asbos, which presently need to be initiated by the police and local authorities. Petitions, public meetings or even highly localised referendums will be used to identify serious local feeling. </p> <p>More than 1,600 orders have now been issued across the country and they are now seen as a key to a Labour victory in next year's election.</p>",
  "<p>While undergoing treatment for breast cancer, Carol Harrigan went to stay with her brother. When she was given the all-clear she breathed a sigh of relief and moved back home. But within a few weeks the cancer was back. Four months later she died. Her daughter Claire wanted to know why. Was it the house that had killed her? </p> <p>We have all heard about sick building syndrome, but how much do we think about what might be harming our health in the comfort of our own home? There could be a lot more than the ominous dust mite to fear. A report published last week by researchers at Bristol University showed a possible link between the use of aerosols and air fresheners in the home and stomach upsets and earache in young children. </p> <p>Our homes are full of dangerous chemicals, and not just the ones we use to 'clean' them. Asthma and eczema sufferers could be reacting to chemicals in their easy-care bedding. Some fire-retardant chemicals are highly toxic. Formaldehyde gas can be released by carpets, upholstery fabrics, ply and particle board, causing headaches, dizziness, rashes, nausea and irritation to the eyes, nose and throat. Then there are phthalates - chemicals used to make plastic flexible (think vinyl flooring and synthetic carpets). Children who crawl and play at floor level are exposed to the highest levels of these chemicals which can interfere with the reproductive system and have also been linked to liver damage and respiratory problems. </p> <p>'People should be able to trust that everything they buy for the home is free from hazardous chemicals,' says Dr David Santillo, senior scientist at the Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter. 'We are trying to make people more aware of chemicals in products, because they are not getting the information else where.' His team has analysed hundreds of products. Recent examination of samples of house dust revealed the presence of highly toxic fire-retardant chemicals. 'These are turning up in people's bodies. They could be coming from textiles and electronic equipment,' says Santillo. When you think about cot mat tresses it makes you shudder. It's no surprise that reported cases of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) are on the rise. It's a condition that is hard to pin down as symptoms are many and varied, often mimicking those of colds or flu and including joint pains, genito-urinary problems and auto-immune disorders. </p> <p>Claire looked at all the potentially toxic things in her mother's home. She also considered the less scientifically demonstrable effects of electromagnetic fields - not just from pylons and phone masts but from power points and appliances in the home - that could damage the immune system. Then she remembered that a dowser had visited the home and announced that it was in an area of geopathic stress, the stress line apparently right below her mother's bed. Geopathic stress lines are said to be areas where 'negative' energy leaks out of the earth's core. In 1929 German scientist and dowser Gustav Freiherr von Pohl drew up a map of areas of geopathic stress in the town of Vilsbiburg. He subsequently found that all the 54 patients who had died of cancer there since records had been kept had slept in beds in areas marked on his map. But there has been little scientific research since. </p> <p>Claire also looked at the things that affect our sense of well-being - light, colour and smell. She left her job in the City to work as a builder and alternative practitioner. She does her own brand of feng shui on people's homes, using colour and aromatherapy as well as practical things like de-cluttering. Occasionally she gets out her dowsing rods. She has been particularly successful at giving homes that positive feeling that makes them sell. And she's rebuilding the inside of her own home as a 'ritual retreat'. </p> <p><strong>Here's how to clear the air</strong><br></p> <p>Banish hazardous chemicals<br> Before you buy anything new for your home, check out Greenpeace's Chemical House (<a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/toxics\">www.greenpeace.org.uk/toxics</a>) that lists products containing potentially dangerous levels of toxic chemicals.</p> <p>Safe cleaning<br> Diluted vinegar, lemon and salt are as effective as many chemically based cleaning products.

  "You have just had a taxing day at work, the bills you lifted from the hall this morning remain unopened and you have spent an hour persuading the kids to go to sleep. To relax you slip into a warm bath and turn on the radio; the hassles of the past 12 hours melt away as you are soothed towards sleep by the dulcet tones of ... Gerry Adams reading from his autobiography. <p>Cynics might quip that listening to the Sinn Fein President's personal account of a life-never-lived-in-the-IRA would be enough to send anyone off to dreamland; the self-righteous tone and folksy sentiment of his latest book contain enough soporific elements to cure the most acute forms of insomnia. This was what listeners to RTE's Book at Bedtime were offered in the first week of September as part of the station's 'commemoration' of the 10th anniversary of the Provos' ceasefire.</p> <p>We will never know if these instalments of Adams' personal story induced mass narcolepsy in the Irish nation but one thing we can be sure about is that his presence on the programme provides further evidence of the 'Big Lad's' superstar status in the Republic. He has certainly come a long way from cage 11, Long Kesh and may end up in Phoenix Park - and I'm not talking Garda headquarters but the Irish Presidency.</p> <p>The idea of President Adams is no longer a fantasy. Given that he is currently the most popular politician in a Republic where he holds no office, there is every chance the Sinn Fein chief could succeed Mary McAleese. And the notion that Adams becomes Chief of Staff of the Irish Defence Forces, while his party colleagues as cabinet ministers control the lives of millions of Irish citizens, is no longer beyond the realms of possibility either. The latter scenario is far more realisable than the former, especially given Fianna Fail's dance-of-the-seven-veils seduction of Sinn Fein.</p> <p>Following Dermot Ahern's suggestion that Sinn Fein could be in coalition with his party there was an attempt at row back. The Taoiseach and a host of Fianna Fail backbenchers qualified the Foreign Minister's remarks by pointing out that this can come about only if the IRA goes out of existence. Willie O'Dea, the Defence Minister, even used the D-word last - the IRA has to disband.</p> <p>These riders however will mean nothing when the numbers stack up after the next general election. For does anyone with a basic grasp of Irish realpolitik really believe that if Sinn Fein has the parliamentary muscle to prop up another Fianna Fail administration, the Soldiers of Destiny and the very real, armed and still dangerous soldiers in Ourselves Alone won't concoct a deal?</p> <p>When the electoral witching hour arrives, will this signal the end of the IRA and its mutation into an old boys/ex-comrades association? This is what Fianna Fail and the Department of Foreign Affairs will try to sell to the Irish people after the votes are counted. 'The Provos are no more. The Boys have retired. They have gone away you know.'</p> <p>The trouble however for Fianna Fail, the peace process in the north and ultimately Irish democracy itself is that the IRA won't be exiting the stage entirely. It is highly likely the organisation will go into cold storage, robberies and rackets may decrease, and so-called punishment beatings in areas under the IRA's con trol will be few and far between.</p> <p>Well, that's the theory anyway. In practice, the IRA will be retained for a number of important reasons.</p> <p>1. Internal political discipline. The IRA is and will remain a means by which Adams and the leadership can control Sinn Fein. IRA activists can be wheeled out at every annual party conference to ensure 'unreliable elements' and 'trendies' don't push for embarrassing policies such as abortion rights. A show of hands from the 'lads' who take their orders from the local commanding officers will put a stop to that nonsense.</p> <p>2. Social control. The IRA fears relinquishing control of its working class redoubts. Its continued presence and the threat of retribution for anyone who transgresses, either politically or through common crime, ensures that dominance.</p> <p>3. Purse strings. The IRA ensures that the millions earned both through illegal and legal means remains in the hands of the movement, or at least that a sizeable proportion of the fortunes from smuggling and counterfeiting is kept for the cause.</p> <p>4. Sectarian strife. Parts of Northern Ireland remain fractured and unstable. The IRA structure will stay in place to offer nationalists communal defence against loyalist attacks and is there to wind up the unionists over marching issues, interface trouble and political crises.</p> <p>As Fianna Fail quietly prepares the ground for a coalition with Sinn Fein, ministers, civil servants, spin masters and their allies in the southern Irish media will assure you that none of the above applies, that the gun is being taken out of Irish politics for good. But those sentiments are as sugary, ephemeral and tendentious as the many purple passages in Adams' autobiography.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Beans</strong> </p> <p>Shock City Maverick <br>(Warp) </p> <p>Hip hop outsider Beans's second outing is impressive if hard going at times. His super-fast rap is delivered over thoroughly electro (and, at times, mockingly artless) rhythms and woozy, weirdo synth noises to confounding effect.He banishes the usual materialism and gun worship to the sidelines in favour of impressively scattershot and colourful statements of intent ('My hip hop is hopscotch with a peg leg unfurl mandible rifle-rattling tongue unleashed held at bay only the gates of teeth,' he declares on 'Shards of Glass'). There is a side serving of lechery, but the full-on rap attack is tempered with some intriguing slow-burn instrumentals: 'You're Dead, Let's Disco' is built on a sample of church bells, 'A Force on Edge' on a queasy low cello sample. The beats on closer 'Diamond Halo Grenade' are worthy of late-Eighties Prince. </p> <p> <strong> The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster</strong> The Royal Society <br> (No Death) </p> <p> Relocating to the Mojave desert and getting Queens of the Stone Age man Chris Goss in on desk duties was obviously the right move for Brighton's Gothabilly whippersnappers. No less energetic than 2002's Horse of the Dog , their second album is a cleverer affair. Singer Guy McKnight lays his charming Nick Cave baritone down on a bed of angular guitars and driving bass, the chord structures, if utterly goth, almost virtuosic in their eccentricity. Tom Diamantopoulo's tom-heavy drumming is masterful. If, at times, the rock fug gets a bit thick ('Migrate Migraine', 'Freud's Black Muck'), there are enough special moments (as when a rogue muted trumpet closes the 6/8 stomp of 'Drunk on the Blood') to carry you through. The contrast between the falsetto verses and rock scream of the chorus to 'I Rejection' is brilliant. </p> <p> <strong> RTX </strong><br>Transmaniacon<br>(Drag City) </p> <p>Many thought Jennifer Herrema and Neil Hagerty's Royal Trux were overhyped, and where some saw Beefheart-like genius in their messy rock scrawl, others just saw a mess. Herrema's new three-piece's debut will bring joy to fans and doubters alike. She bursts into the opening track, 'Limozine', like a twisted female John Lydon over a barrage of big drums and punky guitar, her vocals a huge, drawled, unison sneer. 'Joint Chief', which follows, is equally powerful, and if the tune borrows heavily from Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid', elsewhere Herrema proves she has plenty of melodic clout of her own. It's easy to get hooked on 'Speed to Roam' and the seven-minute closer 'Resurrect'. The heavy autotune on the vocals to 'PB&amp;J' is a gleeful stroke of genius. </p> <p> <strong> Luna </strong><br>Rendezvous <br>(Jetset) </p> <p>After 12 years and seven albums, US indie stalwarts Luna have decided to call it a day. Fortunately, they've chosen to go out in a blaze of understated glory. While Dean Wareham's voice may wear a little thin on tracks such as 'Star-Spangled Man', the group's gift for interweaving sweet guitar lines into a cosy haze is never more evident than on this swansong. Opener 'Malibu Love Nest' is the kind of thing Lou Reed would be doing now were he not such an ass. 'The Owl and the Pussycat' is a casual setting of Lear's poem with brushed jazzy snares and a beautiful, bendy, high guitar solo. The lullaby 'Rainbow Babe' is a fitting coda to the group's lovely oeuvre. </p> <p> <strong>The Beautiful South</strong><br>Golddiggas, Headnodders &amp; Pholk Songs <br>(Sony) </p> <p>Paul Heaton and friends do a covers album: stroke of genius or trite vanity project? Well, a bit of both. Certainly, you can argue that the group bring precisely zilch to Willie Nelson's 'Valentine'; that setting the Ramones' 'Blitzkrieg Bop' to a bouncing, milk-bottle percussion beat was never going to be a good idea. On the other hand, Alison Wheeler and Dave Hemingway do some great harmonies over sparse guitar and strings on a transformed 'Don't Stop Moving' (SClub7); Lush's 'Ciao!' makes for a beautiful, bitter duet; and the jazzy reworking of ELO's 'Livin' Thing' (with ace of bass Danny Thompson) and a Latin-tinged 'Don't Fear the Reaper' prove that you just can't keep a good tune down. Heaton's falsetto on the closing 'I'm Stone in Love with You' (The Stylistics) is a tour de force. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> To order The Royal Society for \u00a312.99 or any other of the above for \u00a313.99 each, all with free UK p&amp;p, call the Observer Music Service on 0870 836 0713</p>",
  "<p><strong>Alan Barnes &amp; John Horler Stablemates </strong> <br>(Woodville WVCD 107) </p> <p> This is turning out to be the season of the saxophone-and-piano duets. A few weeks ago, it was Danny Moss and Stan Tracey, now this well-matched pair. Indeed, so well matched are they that for much of the time the traditional roles of soloist and accompanist fall away and we find ourselves following a two-way conversation, replete with ideas, jokes, abrupt changes of subject, but only the occasional disagreement. Horler's piano can always hold the attention on account of his quirky inventiveness and his sneaky way of reharmonising familiar tunes. Barnes, who plays clarinet here, as well as alto and baritone saxophones, is simply never at a loss. He's a one-man musical Niagara. I used to wonder how long he would be able to keep it up, but I now realise it's a permanent condition. </p> <p> <strong> Wycliffe Gordon</strong><br>In the Cross <br>(Criss Cross 1253 CD) </p> <p> It is rare to find an amalgam of jazz and gospel music that sounds both accomplished and sincere. This is Gordon's second CD combining these two major African-American musical forms. He and the other instrumentalists both play and sing their improvisations against a background supplied by the Garden City Gospel Choir of Atlanta, and the effect is both stirring and faintly disturbing, especially when they are singing wordless scat syllables. This may well be the result he is after, since gospel (represented by the choir) and jazz (embodied in scat) were traditionally viewed as enemies - God's music and the devil's music. The principal musicians are all alumni of Wynton Marsalis's Lincoln Centre Orchestra, and much of this music would not be out of place in some of Marsalis's own work. The gorgeous, resonant sound of Gordon's trombone dominates the ensemble. </p> <p> <strong> Count Basie &amp; Friends </strong><br>100th Birthday Bash<br>(Roulette 73407) </p> <p> A double album compiled to celebrate Basie's centenary year and for anyone wanting an anthology of his late-fifties prime it would do very well, particularly the classic numbers by Quincy Jones and Neal Hefti. There's a phenomenal list of guest artists, including Sarah Vaughan, Tony Bennett, Billy Eckstine, Nat King Cole and the vocal group Lambert, Hendricks and Ross. The clipped minimalism of Basie's piano remains as potent as ever. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> To order Alan Barnes for \u00a313.99, Wycliffe Gordon for \u00a314.99 or Count Basie for \u00a312.99, all with free UK p&amp;p, call the Observer Music Service on 0870 836 0713</p>",
  "<p><strong>Shunt: Tropicana</strong> <br> London Bridge Vaults, London SE1 </p> <p><strong> Julius Caesar; The Two Gentlemen of Verona</strong> <br> RSC Tour, Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre </p> <p> I was panicking. For a minute, I could not find my way out of the vaults under London Bridge station - 70,000 square feet of darkness. The truest compliment I can pay to <strong> Shunt</strong>, a brilliant, venue-based performance company now backed by the National Theatre, is that when I was eventually ejected from a different door from the one through which I had come in, theatrical illusion persisted. I felt as if everything I saw was staged, as if the Northern Line were an experiment and its passengers likely to be actors. </p> <p>Here is a tip. This is how it starts. The woman who looks as though she is about to sell the Evening Standard is holding your ticket. It is she who will let you through a door in the wall, in Joiner Street, outside the tube. Next, you will find yourself in a London Underground worker's cabin. It's a bit of a laugh. The worker tells you to move on, into the next room. </p> <p>The contrast could not be greater: a swanky room, panelled in wood, like an old railway carriage, with grass-green silk on its ceiling. A voiceover tells you in a BBC-of-yesteryear tone that you are safe and, at the same time, finds ways of implying that you are nothing of the kind. He advises a drink and, against the odds, it turns out that behind sections of panelling drinks are served, the most ingenious bar ever known. </p> <p>So far, so great. Going down in the steel lift is exciting - I feel like a metropolitan Alice in Wonderland. But here are the vaults: dark, apparently endless, smelling of damp and dust. A sudden brush with unreality. It is hard to know what to feel. Like a child, you might need to tell yourself: 'It is only a play.' </p> <p>But that does not cover it. From the start, there is a tension between dependency and the question of whether to take any initiative - to explore, to stray. I am sure I will dream about the forbidden greenhouse, a fastness of light, that we passed and were told not to enter. </p> <p>What follows is fantastically uneven. There are longueurs, chapters in which you sit in the dark, dreaming of fresh air. And verbally, the show is weak. At its worst, the script reminded me of a medical students' rag week (could director David Rosenberg's background as an anaesthetist be to blame?). </p> <p>But it is often visually overwhelming: I shan't forget - ever - the sight of a hearse being pushed through the vaults, to the pounding of an electric guitar, by women first encountered as orange tropical birds now turned vultures. These aberrant mourners slide down the bonnet of the hearse, slink sexily along the coffin and do trapeze acts above it. It is decadent, transgressive - almost funny. </p> <p>I loved the trapeze artists most of all, especially at the end, when they descend on us in a light so faint we can barely make them out - like figments of our imagination, tricks of the dark. </p> <p>The Royal Shakespeare Company has its own version of venue-based theatre. It is a rainy afternoon at the Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre in Wales, a stop on the RSC's 2004-5 tour. There could not be a less leisurely play than <strong> Julius Caesar</strong> - bloody stuff for a matinee. David Farr has situated this most formal of Shakespeare's plays, with aggressive informality, in a non-specific modern setting and made its turbulence contemporary, a decision that will help sell it to the schoolchildren filling many of the seats. </p> <p>Caesar is excellently played by Christopher Saul, looking rather like a younger version of Terence Conran, his urbanity only skin-deep. But the most interesting performance is Adrian Schiller's Cassius. His overprecise elocution suggests a paranoid habit of assuming that people pay him insufficient attention. He is defective from the start, a case for the social workers. </p> <p>Brutus has a more dignified demeanour and pukka accent, but is just as base. Zubin Varla's fine interpretation emphasises Brutus's nervous self-regard. In neurosis, Brutus is rivalled only by his wife. The dazzling Rachel Pickup makes Portia a disturbing but coherent whole. When she shows Brutus the cut on her thigh, she seems a modern casualty, a self-harmer. It is miserably plausible that she should go on to kill herself. </p> <p>Gary Oliver's Mark Antony is tremendous. He bellows 'Friends, Romans, Countrymen' to silence the rabble. The speech is superbly navigated, sarcastic incantation alternating with grief, a climax, as it should be. And yet Mark Antony emerges more as an operator than as a force for good. That is the problem with this production - there is no one to admire in it. This is too high a price to pay for a modern setting. </p> <p>After Julius Caesar, Fiona Buffini's production of <strong> The Two Gentlemen of Verona</strong>, her debut with the RSC, is a wonderful armistice. We slip away from battle into a party. She and designer Liz Ascroft set the play in a fast, Art Deco world. Valentine, adequately played by Alex Avery, is keen to encourage his friend Proteus to go on the equivalent of a gap year. Laurence Mitchell's Proteus is a bungling schoolboy (not as complex as he should be). Vanessa Ackerman's strange Julia is a bit of a nutter, a saucer-eyed brunette, more successful as flopper than flapper; her initially discreet kiss with Proteus turning into an extended roll on the floor. </p> <p>Rachel Pickup's Sylvia looks like a Beardsley drawing that has burst out of black and white. She provides a sequence of fashion plates in scarlet silk and furs and plays the part with high-strung charm. The dancing (choreography by Lynne Page) is pure delight. And there's a treat for the antisocial, too - Andrew Melvilles's Launce, a lachrymose Scot and his dog Crab, an elderly Irish wolfhound, whose only crime on stage was to yawn - not fair comment. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Susannah Clapp is away</p>",
  "<p>For 13 years, mountaineer Helmut Simon had basked in the glory of his unique encounter with history. </p> <p>In 1991, the 67-year-old German discovered Otzi the Iceman, the perfectly preserved body of a Neolithic hunter, emerging from the Similaun glacier, 3,200m (10,500ft) up the Austrian Alps. Wherever he went in his beloved Alps, Simon wore a badge identifying himself as 'Discoverer of Otzi'. </p> <p>But yesterday, Simon's body was found in a stream in these same mountains. </p> <p>On 15 October, the pensioner departed alone from the village of Bad Hofgastein, near Salzburg, up the 2,134m (7,000ft) Gamskarkogel peak. His wife, Erika, who usually walked with him, did not go. </p> <p>Foul weather should have deterred the experienced climber, who did not even take a tent with him. </p> <p>Half a metre of snow fell in the three days following his disappearance. On Monday, Simon's wife returned to Nuremberg and rescuers gave up their search. </p> <p>Simon and his wife had made the journey to Bolzano to visit Otzi several times a year. While scientists learnt about Neolithic man by examining Otzi, Simon developed an affection for the 5,300-year-old and came to call the iceman his 'brother'. </p> <p>'Being a discoverer is like being the author of an important invention,' said Simon's Italian lawyer, Armin Weis. 'It becomes your identity.' Simon died just weeks before his lawyers were due to launch a case for him to receive a \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3170,000) reward from Italian authorities for his discovery. </p> <p>Rumours in the villages around the Austro-Italian border suggested Simon may have walked deliberately to his death. Other locals fear Otzi - like Tutankhamen - claimed Simon's life in revenge for disturbing the mummy's peace. </p> <p>The body of the iceman is under renewed scrutiny this time by experts seeking to prove its value in cash rather than archaeological terms. </p> <p>The iceman is one of the best and oldest preserved human bodies because of an extraordinary combination of events. After apparently falling into a crevasse and dying of hypothermia, the Neolithic hunter was quickly covered by snow which preserved his body intact. It appears the Simons found him at the precise moment the body emerged from the melting glacier and before it began to decompose. </p> <p>Under Italian law, Simon was entitled to receive up to 25 per cent of the value of his find. Since he was only recognised as the official finder of the mummy last year, legal proceedings will begin on 5 November to determine the size of the reward. </p> <p>The Otzi mummy, kept in Bolzano's south Tyrol museum of archaeology, has made about \u20ac2 million (\u00a31.4m) per year for northern Italian authorities since 1998. </p> <p>Simon turned down an offer from Italian authorities of \u20ac50,000 several years ago. His lawyers claim his family's reward should be at least four times as much. </p> <p>With Simon's death, the pressure to reward his wife and two children with the amount denied to the climber in his lifetime has increased.</p>",
  "<p>Over the next 10 days, Wall Street and global financial markets have two significant dates to look forward to: the 75th anniversary of the 1929 stock market crash on 29 October, and the presidential elections on 2 November. </p> <p>The first date speaks for itself. The second finds the US financial community - like the rest of the United States - in a state of conflict. Like the direction of the US economy itself, the financial effects of a win by either candidate are almost impossible to read. </p> <p>Typically, Wall Street is solidly Republican, and appears so this time. Economists give Bush an edge on growth and jobs and Kerry on issues of trade and budget deficits. Pensions &amp; Investments, a trade magazine for money managers, found 58.6 per cent of 1,700 readers backed Bush, compared with 33.6 per cent for Kerry. </p> <p>Neither Bush nor Kerry has stressed their economic plans, perhaps knowing that in all likelihood they will be powerless to effect them. </p> <p>'In general, Wall Street would prefer Bush,' says Gregory R Valliere, chief strategist at Charles Schwab. 'They prefer him on tax policy and as a free-trader, as well as for the likelihood that Kerry would be a far more aggressive regulator.' </p> <p>An LA Times survey found that the financial services industry has opened its chequebook for Bush. Of the President's top 10 corporate contributors (ranked by number and size of employee donations) Morgan Stanley led with $527,030, with Merrill Lynch second at $495,604. </p> <p>The figures speak as a reward to Bush for his tax reforms, especially in reducing the tax on dividend income. Further, since Kerry emerged with the potential to win the election the markets have steadily dropped. </p> <p>But while Bush's economic policies have benefited Wall Street, there is the persistent fear that the broader consequences - spectacular federal budget deficits and soaring personal debt - will take the economy and securities markets over a cliff. </p> <p>The 'disaster now or catastrophe later' school of economic thinking, led by Steven Roach, Morgan Stanley's global chief economist, holds that neither Bush nor Kerry can do much to correct the US's economic course. Under the bleakest scenario, foreign banks will stop buying US securities, the dollar will plunge, the Fed will raise interest rates, consumers will stop spending, house prices will fall and the country will be plunged into recession. </p> <p>That view is as disputable as most of what passes for discourse in this election. Last week Bush campaign managers attacked Kerry's domestic economic plan with a letter signed by 368 economists. The group, Economists for Bush, said Kerry's proposed tax increases threatened the economy's vitality. His plan to 'expand the size and scope of government will limit future economic growth and lead to increasingly grim fiscal choices,' they wrote. </p> <p>The Kerry campaign countered with a letter signed by 169 business school professors, 56 from the Harvard Business School. </p> <p>It read: 'We are concerned that US economic policy has taken a dangerous turn under your stewardship ... your policy of slashing taxes - primarily for those at the upper reaches of the income distribution - has not worked.' </p> <p>Wall Street Democrats accuse their counterparts of placing personal gain ahead of responsibility to clients. 'The average Wall Street firm is run by extraordinarily avaricious, greedy people who don't know their own interests,' said Seth Glickenhaus, 91-year-old founder of the money management firm Glickenhaus &amp; Co. </p> <p>'These are salespeople,' he told the LA Times. 'They're not thinkers.' </p> <p>Kerry has a significant lead on issues of fiscal responsibil ity in the polls. Studies by Brian Knight of Brown University show that the economy tends to do better overall under the Democrats, while benefiting specific industries, such as defence and pharmaceuticals, under the Republicans. </p> <p>But as with so much else in this election, tradition is inverted. Republican administrations would typically be anti-deficit spending, but under Bush the national debt ballooned to $477 billion as money has poured into farm subsidies, social security, healthcare and the military. </p> <p>The argument in some quarters is that in order to be fiscally prudent, it is now better to vote Democrat. With such manifest inconsistencies, and the problems the US faces as babyboomers retire, it's little wonder Bush and Kerry would rather not talk too much about it. </p> <p>In 1992, James Carville coined the political maxim 'It's the economy, stupid!' This year's version, the joke goes, is: 'It's the economy, dammit!' </p> <p>Perhaps more important than who is in the White House is the political balance of Congress. Wall Street likes legislative gridlock because politicians cannot apply their financial ideas. </p> <p>'It's an acceptable scenario to the market because when they have gridlock they do less harm,' says Valliere. While there can be no comprehensive energy policy or tort reform, the new president can still appoint to the regulatory agencies. Both candidates plan to halve the annual budget deficit by 2009; most economists doubt either will be able to. </p> <p>While Bush and Kerry would like to appear in control of the economic future, they are servants of the economic cycle and second to the Federal Reserve. </p> <p>'The candidates might have some impact on jobs in the margins but Greenspan is more important than the President and the economic cycle is more important than Greenspan,' says Valliere. </p> <p>And where are we in the cycle? 'It's an erratic recovery that will prevail.'</p>",
  "New York loves Vera Drake. Even lunchtime showings of Mike Leigh's film about backstreet abortion are filling two city cinemas. It seems strange to me, a visitor, that the stewed tea, rigid morals and lurid wallpaper of Fifties England should jump cultures so easily, but why not? Manhattan may not be big on nostalgia or faded Constable prints, but it takes its sexual politics seriously. <p>When the Republican convention came to town two months ago, tens of thousands of pro-abortionists marched over Brooklyn Bridge. Same-sex couples outnumber heterosexual ones at many restaurants, and the wedding pages of the New York Times feature gay commitment ceremonies alongside brides in veils. </p> <p>Vera Drake fits well with this progressive backdrop. Imelda Staunton's motherly cleaning lady is also a social pioneer, moving from one council flat to the next with her biscuit tin containing rubber tubing and carbolic soap to 'help out' girls with nowhere else to turn. Her impulse, never financial but not self-consciously charitable either, is the reflex altruism of someone who sees a need and meets it. </p> <p>Finally, Vera, who judges no one, meets the forces of censoriousness. Her son considers her a killer, her employers treat her as a pariah, and she must make her case before a law that regards abortionists, except for those providing a discreet service for the rich, as murderers and corrupters. Leigh's homages to the poor are sometimes cloying, but this one has a special relevance for a Britain in which pro-lifers urge tighter curbs on terminating pregnancies. It is also an eerily apt fable for today's America. </p> <p>Vera Drake's 20 years of back bedroom abortions begin a timeline that has always been more erratic in the US than the UK. In 1965, all 50 states retained a ban. In 1973, the case of Roe v Wade legalised abortion. In 1984, three clinics were bombed on Christmas Day and the perpetrators called their actions 'a birthday gift for Jesus'. </p> <p>And in 2004, on the cusp of a new presidential term, Vera Drake is less a snapshot of an ancient world than a glimpse of how tomorrow's America may look. If George W Bush wins, he will be able to replace four retiring supreme court judges with candidates who share his beliefs, thus opening the way to state bans on abortion and a God-driven social creed. </p> <p>Liberal Europe is horrified that Rocco Buttiglione, who thinks that homosexuality is sinful and that marriage is for breeding, is on the brink of becoming justice commissioner. That prospect, though obnoxious, is less alarming than the apex of the US judiciary moving wholesale to the grip of neocons. </p> <p>When the stakes are so high, it is not surprising that the election is being fought out over a petri dish. John Kerry, whose campaign resembles a biology GCSE course, promises to overturn Bush's block on funding embryonic stem cell research. Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Nancy Reagan, Christopher Reeve's widow and a large chunk of 100 million sick Americans are on Kerry's side. </p> <p>God is not, though. The Catholic church opposes therapeutic cloning and wrangles over Kerry's pro-abortion stance. Right-wingers want him excommunicated, while Vatican sources say banishment should be reserved for those who 'procure or perform' an abortion. Mr Kerry is no Vera Drake, but neither is he palatable to the churches or to family fundamentalist groups which call their other fight, against gay marriage, 'our Stalingrad'. </p> <p>How, commentators are suddenly wondering, did religion and politics get so entwined? But why should anyone be surprised, when Bush signalled from the start his intention to merge heaven and the state? In the beginning was Pastor Marvin Olasky, his first guru and prophet of 'compassionate conservatism'. More recently, when asked by Bob Woodward if he took his father's advice, the President said: 'There is a higher father I appeal to.' If God-Botherers Anonymous existed, then Mr Bush, an addictive personality who holds cabinet prayer sessions, would have joined up long ago. </p> <p>What's new in this election is the collision of faith and tactics. More than 40 per cent of Americans say they have been born again, while a quarter of the electorate are white evangelical Protestants. Of that group, four million did not vote in 2000. Among Catholic grandees, debates about Kerry's dissident behaviour have eclipsed church reservations over the Iraq war. No wonder that Karl Rove, Bush's political strategist, saw God's way as salvation alley. </p> <p>In secular Britain, the Almighty is more problematic. Tony Blair's Bible-by-the-bed godliness soothes few voters. His comment about answering to 'my maker' for the deaths of British soldiers was met with alarm, and advisers vetoed his wish to end a prewar broadcast with the benediction: 'God bless you.' </p> <p>There is nothing furtive about George Bush's faith and yet objectors are only just waking up to the double danger of lobotomised evangelism. The first threat is a supreme court likely, if Bush wins, to skew the law against compassion and science. Already, Bush has brought in a ban on late abortions. Many of the 70,000 women who die each year of botched terminations, mostly in the developing world, might be saved but for the rule forbidding NGOs with US funding for family planning from providing abortions. </p> <p>The second danger is aired by Ron Suskind in his New York Times essay, published last week, on faith. Though Suskind's analysis is masterful, it should be no shock that Bush has adopted a knit-your-own reality based on hunch and the arrogance of the unquestioning. Simplistic notions of good and evil and the sacrificing of objective truth to God-given certainty were evident long before 9/11. </p> <p>Those of us educated by nuns saw early on how this sort of implacability works. At my Catholic primary, it was a sin for girls to wear trousers and missing Mass led straight to hell. Such dubious certitudes seemed out of vogue until Mr Bush, a hardline Methodist, took over the White House. He might as well have hung a sign marked 'Narnia' on the gate. </p> <p>This fantasy land inhabited by the US President - and occupied by Mr Blair on a time-share basis over the Iraq war - has odd rules on killing. You cannot harm a blastocyst, but you can execute a young prisoner on death row. Embryos are sacred, but the children of Falluja are expendable. Science promises cures and miracles, but the most advanced country in the world risks heading back down a Via Dolorosa to the time of Vera Drake . </p> <p>George W Bush has marked out the election battlefield as a fight over the sanctity of existence. He is right. The argument about the destruction of human beings is critical, but it should not be focused on driving abortion into the backstreets or halting scientific progress. It should dwell, instead, on a war mandated by God and run by idiots. </p> <p>The question is which candidate is more likely to forge domestic and foreign policies ordaining suffering and squandered lives. And the answer is that people of every faith and none should wish, for all our sakes, that John Kerry wins. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@observer.co.uk\">mary.riddell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "It is with a heavy heart that Bruno Pisano conducts his morning tour of Strasbourg's central military cemetery. Twice in the past four months he has found the white tombstones soiled with Nazi graffiti. The first time, boot prints were still visible on the broken graves. The second time, swastikas had been painted on three rows of Muslim tombstones, and neo-Nazi slogans scribbled on the walls. <p>'I felt revolted when I saw what had been done,' said Pisano, who has worked as cemetery guardian for four years. 'These were the graves of Frenchmen who gave their lives for France in the Second World War - that's why it's so offensive. I don't think we've seen the last of this.' </p> <p>Since April, the French region of Alsace, which borders Germany, has seen about 16 similar desecrations and more than 300 tombs have been defaced. Catholic, Muslim and Jewish graveyards have been hit in rotation, with satanic symbols and Nazi slogans scrawled on the stones. Locals are becoming weary of the vehement political denunciations and televised atonement ceremonies in the graveyards after each incident. Despite the frequency of the attacks, police have made little progress in identifying the culprits. </p> <p>Last week vandals struck again in a small graveyard in Wattwiller. During the night a Nazi flag was put on the pole kept for the French flag and the headstone of a war hero killed in 1915 - the only Muslim grave in the cemetery - was broken off and stolen. </p> <p>Over the past few months, the unsolved attacks in Alsace have progressed from a local embarrassment to a national scandal. A government-commissioned report concluded last week that rising racism and anti-semitism represent a 'radical threat to the survival of our democratic system'. In the first nine months of this year, police logged 123 racist attacks and 294 threats in France, as well as 166 anti-semitic attacks and 584 threats, totals higher than those for all 2003. </p> <p>The desecrations in Alsace have become the most potent symbol of this racism. But regional officials are split over whether the desecrations are truly representative of a national phenomenon or the work of tiny, marginal splinter groups, responding to issues peculiar to Alsace. Some hint that ignoring the trend might be the most effective way of combating it. </p> <p>'I don't want to minimise the gravity of the situation but this is nothing like the hatred of the 1930s. One must maintain a sense of proportion,' local Jewish leader Pierre L\u00e9vy said. 'Nevertheless the attacks are poisoning the atmosphere here.' </p> <p>One of the report's recommendations last week was to put cameras in graveyards across France, but the president of Alsace's regional government, Adrien Zeller, said: 'There are hundreds of cemeteries and synagogues. It's impossible to guard them all. These are very soft targets. You can't put a policeman behind every madman . . . </p> <p>'The problem is that this appears to be the work of lone individuals or groups so tiny it is virtually impossible to get at them. It's probably the work of a few poor, deprived skinheads trying to make a reputation for themselves.' </p> <p>Alsace's closeness to Germany has meant it has been a venue for clandestine neo-Nazi conferences. These are effectively outlawed in Germany, but looser French legislation means that village halls have been hired out under false pretexts. The close coincidence of one such meeting earlier this year with a cemetery attack meant that suspicion fell for a while on these groups, but this lead proved inconclusive. </p> <p>The question of neo-Nazi resurgence is a painful one because of Alsace's history, passing from French to German hands and a willing collaborator with the Nazis in the war. In Alsace the National Front took above 25 per cent of the vote in 2002. </p> <p>A Muslim community leader, Abdelhaq Nabaoui, has been targeted. He said: 'They scrawled \"Death to Nabaoui\" on the wall of one of the Muslim cemeteries. Through me, they're attacking the entire local Muslim community.' </p> <p>Responsible for three cemeteries in the Strasbourg area, Pisano knows how difficult it is to protect them. 'All I can do is tour the graveyards every morning and hope that I don't find anything new.'</p>",
  "The newly elected European Parliament and incoming European Commission are in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation that threatens to stop the new administration from taking office on 3 November. The issue is Rocco Buttiglione, the Italian Prime Minister's nomination for Commissioner, who is set to take over the European Justice and Home Affairs portfolio. <p>Buttiglione is a Catholic conservative, a longstanding member of Communion and Liberation, dedicated to bringing religious values into political life. His Christian Democratic party delivered all Sicily's parliamentary seats to Silvio Berlusconi under a cloud of allegations of quid pro quos from the Mafia. Buttiglione's selection for the sensitive Justice and Home Affairs portfolio has pleased few and angered many, particularly after, in hearings before the European Parliament, he stated his belief that homosexuality is a sin and that single mothers were not 'good'. </p> <p>These are not merely privately held beliefs. As Italy's Europe Minister he advocated paying women to not have abortions and a ban on artificial insemination. As a believer in bringing religious values into political life he is practising what he preaches. Of even more concern, however, given his role as Europe's justice commissioner, is his history of helping construct Italian law to suit party political purposes, in particular his role in helping secure immunity from prosecution for Berlusconi. </p> <p>The European Parliament wants Buttiglione moved to a less high-profile post, it will use its powers to block the appointment of the entire Commission, carefully constructed out of inter-country compromises and backroom deals by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the incoming commission president. The European Parliament should hold its ground. In a religiously and culturally diverse continent, Buttiglione's private beliefs must remain private. By insisting that Barroso think again, Europe's Parliament is sending an important message of its expectations of the future conduct of European institutions.</p>",
  "European politicians were in frantic meetings this weekend amid the unprecedented crisis sparked by an Italian politician whose appointment MEPs say will 'undermine the quality' of EU justice. <p>The controversy over Italy's would-be justice commissioner's fitness for office is dividing MEPs. Now it is being also seen as having crippled the authority of the incoming EC president, Jose Manuel Barroso. </p> <p>The debacle is also resonating in Italy, where the Catholic church has become embroiled in the debate over whether Rocco Buttiglione should be in charge of rights, civil liberties and immigration issues for Europe. </p> <p>Liberal and socialist groups, who believe Buttiglione, a friend of the Pope, has views that make him unfit for office, were scrambling to rally enough MEPs to vote down the entire 25-member commission on Wednesday. </p> <p>The 'nuclear option' is the last resort for MEPs, who have pressed Barroso to drop the nominee or at least shuffle him out of such a sensitive role. </p> <p>A defiant Barroso - who has stood by Buttiglione and proposed, to appease concern, that he be shadowed by four commissioners for civil liberties issues - says he is confident his commission will survive. He described the critics as 'extremists'. According to reports, Barroso thinks he will win 363 votes, enough, given the numbers expected to abstain, to confirm his team. </p> <p>Among those campaigning against Barroso's commission is MEP Antonio di Pietro, the former Milan magistrate who led anti-corruption investigations. He said yesterday: 'I am calling on all European liberals to vote against this whole commission. </p> <p>'Unless there is some change, I hope the Barroso commission will be voted out,' di Pietro said. 'I say that not just because of Mr Buttiglione's views on homosexuals. I say it because I believe that no member of Berlusconi's government should be given control of jus tice for the EU. The Berlusconi government is an anomaly as far as the law. </p> <p>Martin Schulz, a German MEP and leader of 200-strong socialist group, said Barroso was risking a calamitous defeat. If Barroso's gamble does not pay off, he could find himself starting his five-year term with a constitutional crisis. And this in the same week in which Europe's leaders will be in Rome to sign the new EU constitution. </p> <p>Should Barroso's gamble fail, the outgoing commission, led by Italian Romano Prodi, will have to preside over a grandiose ceremony in the caput mundi on Friday while Barroso retreats to form a new team. </p> <p>At the same time, Vatican officials will be still upset that the Pope's plea for Europe's Christian roots to be enshrined in its constitution landed on deaf, northern European ears. </p> <p>From the Holy See, some of the strongest cries of foul play rose last week amid a furious Europe-wide debate over the effects of mixing religion with politics. While Buttiglione's view that homosexuality is a 'sin but not a crime' and marriage exists to allow women to have children with the protection of a man caused offence across progressive-thinking Europe, in Italy the uproar was seen by many as a sign that Europe's obsession with being 'politically correct' has gone too far. </p> <p>'There are only three categories of people who are not protected by political correctness and therefore you can say anything bad you want about them,' Vittorio Messori, Italy's leading Catholic writer told Il Messaggero, 'Catholics, smokers and hunters'. </p> <p>The Avvenire newspaper of the Roman Catholic Bishops Conference complained that the decision of the European Rights Commission to rule Buttiglione unfit for public office 'because of what he thinks' is 'a sad sign for civilisation - not for religion.' </p> <p>'They have discriminated against a person on the basis of his faith and his ideas,' the paper said.</p>",
  "<p>The latest phenomenon to hit the New York art scene is a painter whose large-scale abstract works have already been compared to those of Pollock, Mir\u00f3, Klee and Kandinsky. When she had her first show in August, the canvases were selling for $1,500. When I originally arranged to meet her three weeks ago they had gone up to $6,000, and on my arrival at the gallery the one piece remaining had been priced at $15,000. What they'll be worth by the time you read this is anyone's guess. </p> <p>Within a week of her most recent exhibition, she had been filmed by more than 10 TV crews, received calls from David Letterman, Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah, and been labelled a 'world-famous Abstract Expressionist'. But the artist herself is said to be oblivious to it all. She is, according to those closest to her, 'kind of reclusive', 'very sensitive', 'temperamental' at times, and extremely loath to talk about her work. Nevertheless, I am advised to come and interview her early - not just because her fame is spreading fast, but because she has to go to pre-school at 12 o'clock. </p> <p>Marla Olmstead is four years old. She lives in Binghamton, upstate New York, a small town once known for the manufacture of munitions and cigars, and now working its way out of a recession. The fact that her paintings have met with such extreme and sudden success has delighted child psychologists, infuriated art experts, and sent every pushy parent on the eastern seaboard into overdrive. To the old chestnut that modern art looks like something a four-year-old child could do, Marla has responded as if in tribute to Groucho Marx's famous line: 'Run out and find me a four-year-old child.' </p> <p>I am greeted at Anthony Brunelli's loft - two floors above his gallery - by Marla's extended entourage: her mother, her brother, her grandmother, her aunt, and her gallerist's wife. (Brunelli and Marla's father are downstairs, bringing her latest work in from the car.) They are sitting around a huge open-plan space with exposed brick walls and all the mod cons a small star could hope for - plasma TV, vintage arcade game, supersized jars of sweets on the kitchen counter. Marla, a lovely-looking slip of a girl wearing a blue tar tan miniskirt, is tucking into a bowl of jelly beans. Her two-year-old brother, Zane, has nearly finished his, and zips around, talks over her, grins at the slightest opportunity. Marla, by way of greeting, offers a wide-eyed stare. </p> <p>I tell her I like her paintings. </p> <p>'What do you say when someone compliments you, Marla?' her mother calls from the other end of the room. </p> <p>'Thank you,' she says obediently, and looks down at her jelly beans. </p> <p>'What's your favourite colour?' I ask, bending down to look at them with her. Rarely has that seemed a more loaded question. </p> <p>'Pink,' she says, automatically. There isn't a pink jelly bean, nor is there really any pink in her paintings. Her answer is the same as any four-year-old girl's. Of course. What did I expect her to say - international Yves Klein blue? </p> <p>It all started, Mark Olmstead tells me when he arrives, just before Marla's second birthday. 'I was trying to paint and she kept asking me if she could do it too. So I put some paper on the easel, and let her go at it with a brush and palette of acrylics. But she wanted to paint so much and use all the colours so much a piece of paper wasn't enough for her. So we put her in front of a big canvas - she was in her diaper - and she sat there on the dining-room table, and went to town.' </p> <p>At first Mark - an amateur painter with a penchant for competitive sports - would squeeze out the paint for her. But now Marla has evolved new techniques, such as fingerpainting, squirting paint from ketchup bottles, and, most recently, the full Jackson Pollock: dripping paint from a brush directly onto the canvas. 'I didn't know how talented she was,' her father beams, 'and I do think she's exceptionally talented - though I wouldn't use the word prodigy,' he adds, with the modesty of one used to the term. 'We don't like that word at all.' </p> <p>Her first paintings were small, mostly, though there is one enormous early work, Aquarium , in Brunelli's loft. They are now all taller than Marla herself, and several times as wide. Forceful swathes of primary colour, her paintings are strikingly beautiful, and remarkably consistent. She has even evolved over the last few months, moving from the Mir\u00f3 period of Asian Sun (she and her parents began to title the works for convenience) to the Auerbach-esque impasto of Mosquito Bite or Waterfall, though her father does not believe he has ever taken her to a museum. </p> <p>Jackie Westcott, an art collector and self-described Impressionist painter who owns a local art school, bought a 'Marla' early on. She was impressed by all the paintings she saw, she says, because 'they were compositionally balanced, and the colour was vivid and vibrant, and everything was just so incredibly sophisticated. You know, she uses a lot of complementary colour mixtures, which basically, if not done properly, would turn into mud. But she for some reason has this incredible gift, so that when she's mixing these complements they turn into beautiful forms.' </p> <p>Marla paints for about an hour, about three mornings a week, in the garden if the weather's good, or in the kitchen. Her father is a manager on the late shift at the Frito-Lay crisp factory nearby, and has mornings free. Mark is the first to say his own work is not of professional standard; in fact, most of his canvases have been painted over by Marla, because he couldn't afford to keep buying her more blank ones. Marla will work on a painting over several days, and only she knows when it's finished. 'It's hard to watch her paint,' Laura Olmstead tells me, cringing slightly, 'because we feel in our hearts that some of her best work has been painted over.' Mark laughs in agreement. 'She'll paint something we think is gorgeous, and then she'll just paint over it. And we'll go, \"Grrhhh!\"' </p> <p>Marla and Zane, pepped up with jelly beans, are squealing and swinging around on two hammocks hanging from the ceiling of the loft. They jump up, sink their faces into the mesh and take off. Zane disappears and I ask Marla if she wants help getting in, but she has her own system, and swings away. </p> <p>Marla's grandmother, who is overseeing the gymnastics, thinks recent developments are 'fantastic'. 'I really think the whole thing is ... of the Lord,' she says. 'It has to be, you can see His hand in it.' </p> <p>Did she like abstract art before? 'No,' she says emphatically. 'I mean, I could appreciate some of it, but I would never have had it in my home. Now I can't believe that my granddaughter has done this.' </p> <p>'That,' Brunelli interjects, 'is one of the single greatest things that has come out of this. Marla has done for abstract art what many artists couldn't do. She's brought it mainstream to people. Abstract art was supposed to be for the upper echelons. What Marla's painting has done is brought it down to ... even little kids can understand it.' </p> <p>Not only that, but Marla's work is perhaps even better than most. 'There's something in her work that I haven't found in even famous abstract painters' work,' Brunelli continues. 'You seek out things and you see them. This one here,' he says, pointing to the painting on the wall in front of us, 'it's called Aquarium and it really gives you that ... that feel of the aquarium.' </p> <p>Anthony Brunelli is an artist in his own right - a photo-realist who confesses that 'abstraction was never my forte'. His gallery has been open about a year, and it was not long after he started that he was shown Marla's work by a man who had seen it in the local coffee shop. (Laura's friend Andy runs the coffee shop, and suggested they put Marla's pictures up.) 'There was something about this painting that he showed me,' Brunelli remembers, 'I was just like, \"Wow, this is great\". He goes, \"it's a local artist that you should probably represent\". I said yeah, and started asking him all these questions, like how do I get in contact with this artist, and he goes, \"Well, you'll have to call her parents because she's three years old.\" I didn't believe him. I mean, there was no way a three-year-old could do this.' </p> <p>It turned out that he already knew the artist's father. Brunelli and Mark Olmstead had been friends since they were Marla's age, and had lost touch after high school. He went to their house for brunch, saw Marla's other paintings, and cancelled his holiday in order to put on a show of her work in August. Now, he says, 'we've had calls from all over the world. We have a waiting list of 60 people who want to buy her work. Do you know,' he asks, as a hint of tension creeps into his voice, 'how long it's going to take her to do 60 paintings?' </p> <p>Marla has opened up a frilly pink parasol and is using it for balance as she silently tiptoes around a decorative hearth. She has painted about 30 canvases in her life so far. 'As far as the waiting list goes,' Laura tells me, 'that's nothing we'd expect her to fulfill. We honestly feel that it's within her personality to say, \"I don't like it any more\". If it continues, it was meant to be,' she concludes sweetly, 'and if it ends tomorrow it was wonderful.' </p> <p>Marla is not the only pre-schooler to have shown her work in an art gallery (though it must be said that one-child shows are rare). The first exhibition of child art in America took place in 1912, at Alfred Stieglitz's landmark 291 Gallery, best known for its impact on pictorialist photography. It included the work of two- to 11-year-olds, and the work, Stieglitz said, shared 'much of the spirit of so-called modern work'. </p> <p>In Europe, such shows were old hat. There was a prominent exhibition of children's art every year from the turn of the century until the First World War; Roger Fry showed it in England at his Omega Workshop, and Max Ernst was exhibited alongside it in Cologne. Kandinsky, Klee, Picasso and Mir\u00f3 all collected children's art. Matisse - one of whose collages Marla Olmstead has hanging above her bed - even incorporated the work of his children into his own. A picture done by the young Pierre Matisse hangs on the wall in the background of two of his father's can vases. Picasso once said that the key to understanding Matisse was the influence of his children's work: 'Their naive drawings fascinated him and completely changed his style.' </p> <p>Later on, and closer to Marla's home, Mark Rothko taught art to Jewish children in Brooklyn during a significant period, 1929 to 1952. When he had his first one-man show in 1933, he included some of his students' work alongside his. A reviewer commented at the time that the children seemed to have 'helped to make him see and feel with their own simplicity and instinct for truth.' </p> <p>But while Marla clearly has what John Ruskin admiringly termed 'the innocence of the eye', she is not 'regaining' childhood, as these artists sought to. Art critics would say it's the recapturing itself that is the artistic act. Isn't the nostalgia for childhood what those works are about? Does a child painting so effortlessly constitute art in the same way? </p> <p>'I'm not sure it is effortless,' says William Crain, professor of psychology at the City University of New York and author of Reclaiming Childhood , 'and I don't understand why that would diminish it.' Crain believes the extent to which Marla represents childhood is more significant than the extent to which she represents modern art. 'We could consider her as an exceptional genius, but I think it's more important that she's representative of all children who have this in them. We just don't give them a chance.' </p> <p>Days after the Marla story broke, the New York Times did an experiment. Marla was working with acrylics and brushes on canvas, where most kids her age would be given paper and crayons. If others had the same materials, would they reveal the same talents? Savvy Manhattan kids were armed with oils, and one of them even tried to reproduce a Jackson Pollock she had seen in the Metropolitan Museum. But the Times concluded that 'Marla faces no immediate competition for wall space at the gallery'. </p> <p>Brunelli, who is showing the work of an autistic child concurrently in his second gallery space, scoffs at the idea of multiple Marlas. 'I can show you a list of emails from people all over the world who want me to represent their kids now!' he laughs. But Laura Olmstead doesn't think the question of whether any four-year-old could do what Marla does is insulting or rhetorical. 'I'm not arguing,' she says. 'If you feel like your kid could do that, then let them, because it's fun. That's the bottom line - she enjoys it. On garbage day I could bring it out to the kerb, and she couldn't care.' Laura does what she can to promote a sense of normality. One TV presenter who came to film them directed Marla to 'go play with the normal kids'. 'She is a normal kid!' Laura insisted. </p> <p>The family strongly resists depictions of Brunelli as a Svengali figure. 'He's been portrayed as some sort of marketing genius,' Mark scoffs, 'which is so far from the truth!' Brunelli looks a little miffed. Blame or praise aside, however, a question remains. If Marla has a waiting list longer than the number of paintings she is likely to make before she turns seven - the age at which developmental psychologists believe rational intelligence begins to encroach on creativity - then what good can all the fame do her? </p> <p>In the gallery, the artist's name, as written on the wall, is not 'Marla Olmstead' - though her surname has a distinguished ring to it, distantly related as she is to the man who designed Central Park. The name simply reads 'Marla', in a childlike font. One of the most striking aspects of Marla's paintings is her signature - a large scrawl in the bottom right corner with a capital 'R' written backwards. (Two or three of her early works remain unsigned - they were sold before she learned to write.) But the label in the gallery is not her signature; it's merely a signal of childhood. Whether or not Brunelli knew how old she was at first, now Marla has become inseparable from her age. She is a child-artist, she is 'Marla', she is, already, a brand. </p> <p>Which is, presumably, what's driving the prices up. Bill Fine, president of Artnet, the largest international gallery network online, tells me that the median price for original canvases on the New York art market now is about $7,000-9,000, which means Marla's work is already commanding twice the average. How did it get to this point? Fine explains that the price for works of art is normally set by supply and demand. But at the age of four, how could Marla have a body of work that would set such a precedent? 'It probably is 80 per cent hype and 20 per cent supply and demand,' he concludes. </p> <p>Fine is sceptical about the Marla phenomenon. 'I would take a quizzical view of all this,' he says, 'because in art you don't have prodigies the way you do in music. There's no such thing as a Mozart. An artist has to continue to work to grow. She's not there - she can't be, at four. I just don't believe in it.' On the other hand, Stuart Simpson, a collector who owns Monets and Renoirs and says he would have paid 'any price' for the Marla he bought, suggests that what he saw in Marla's work was 'her soul'. </p> <p>Many have argued that an artist needs a lifetime of experience in order to make great art. But a psychoanalyst would say that people spend much of their lives working through the events of their first four years - in which case Marla may well be sloshing raw angst straight on to the canvas. </p> <p>When Jackie Westcott first met Marla, she was struck by what 'wise eyes' she had. 'I remember looking into her eyes and seeing something very deep, and very powerful,' she tells me. </p> <p>In the course of the morning that I spend with her, Marla smiles at me from time to time, from halfway behind something - a wall, a sofa, a hammock - and at one point her aunt persuades her to show me her new pink nail varnish. But all of this is done in silence. She spends the time on the periphery of the conversation, taking all of it in. We go downstairs to look at her pictures together, and she says nothing about them, preferring to hide behind someone's legs. 'We don't ask her about it,' Laura explains. 'There's no emphasis placed on it. She's a very shy kid, and it's one area in her life where she's expressive, so we don't want that taken from her.' </p> <p>Marla has spoken about her work only once. Andy Stevens, who owns Coffee Talk, the place where her paintings were shown first of all, asked her if a particular painting was easy to do. 'It's not that easy,' she said solemnly, 'but I did it.' Everyone in the room fell into shock. One striking feature of her newest paintings, Andy points out, is that she has painted eyes into them. They are symbols, like hieroglyphs or the sign used to mean 'the evil eye'. 'And,' Andy tells me with quiet concern, 'a friend of mine who is also an artist wondered if that's because so many people are watching her.'</p>",
  "Iskandariya is the sort of name that would look right on a regimental colours. For those of us at home, it has the ring of distant battle, like Alma and Cawnpore. Yet stand in the cool of the Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle and there is another name that comes to mind in the wake of news that the Black Watch are heading into the American zone in Iraq; that of St Valery. <p>In 1940, the 1st Battalion of the Black Watch were at the core of the 51st Highland Division. It was the 51st who were ordered to turn and face the Germans, despite odds of 10 to one against them, so that 345,000 British and French troops could escape from Dunkirk. A few years ago, historian Saul David revealed Churchill had faced the choice between sacrificing the Highlanders or the London-based Guards. Public opinion dictated who had to turn and fight.</p> <p>Obviously, the scale of the two events are not comparable. The 51st lost 1,000 men at St Valery, with a further 8,000 captured, and we can only hope the 850 troops who will shortly head north (Iskandariya is the suspected destination) will come home with no losses.</p> <p>Fear is fear, though, and danger is danger, and scale will mean very little to the family of a soldier who is hurt or killed. 'People who weren't there think of it like some black-and-white newsreel but film will never tell you about the smell of battle or the cries of your friends dying,' said one veteran of St Valery 60 years later.</p> <p>What is disturbing is not the differences but the similarities between the two events; Scottish soldiers being sent into harm's way on an ugly suggestion of political expediency.</p> <p>The soldiers, having been told they might be going, have been widely reported to be keen to get on with the job. You can almost feel the summoning of the will; the need to crush feelings of regret because a lack of commitment could be fatal. Away from the front line, others weren't so stoic: 'If I saw Blair now, I'd smack him right in the mouth,' said the father of two of the soldiers.</p> <p>This seems - and is - a parallel universe to Westminster. Watching the cameras flick from Geoff Hoon making his statements in the House of Commons to the regimental museum in Perth, you could be watching a different species of people. Ex-soldiers, called upon to comment, express their worries with a matter of factness that seems not of our time.</p> <p>Admiral Sandy Woodward was once interviewed about his role as commander of the Falklands battle group. He talked about placing his destroyers in front of his aircraft carriers in order to protect them from Argentinian Exocets. I recall being a little shocked when he spoke of the sacrifice those on the destroyers might have to make: 'Shouldn't have joined if you can't take a joke.'</p> <p>Black humour has long been the last defence of the army when faced with politicians, and I'm sure there is plenty of it among the Black Watch. Woodward's true feelings hardly need spelling out. Perhaps that's why the statements coming from those involved with the regiment seem so straightforward. Despite liberal suspicion, clarity is a necessity in the face of mortal danger.</p> <p>Of course, clarity is not the way of the politicians. There has been a lot of talk of late about how Blair has squandered the trust he once had. Beyond the curious mathematical necessity of sending less than 1,000 troops into such a volatile area, it is telling that everyone immediately assumed the Prime Minister had an underhand rea son for this transfer of troops, namely keeping George W Bush in the White House.</p> <p>A few weeks before he came to power in 1997, Blair complained about me to my boss. I had written about a high-speed tour he took of Johannesburg's Alexandra township. Blair didn't like my stabs at humour, writing to my then editor that my 'cynicism' was the reason so many people were turning away from politics. So it is peculiar to say, but I cannot accept this immediate assumption of Blair's mendacity. Have we really come to the point where we believe he is content to put Scottish soldiers in danger in order to get a Republican back into the White House?</p> <p>This is a bit meaningless, though, because there's plenty of room to believe this is why the Americans have asked. Blair's policy, with Clinton and Bush, has been to cosy up to the White House and there's no reason to believe he wouldn't do the same if Kerry wins on 2 November. The trouble is that a policy of compliance needs consistency to work.</p> <p>So the weight of realpolitik falls on the shoulders of Scottish soldiers - again. Blair's choosing to lighten the moment by promising that the troops would be 'home by Christmas', with all the resonance that phrase has, was inept. While it is in his power to make it come true, it's beyond his control to ensure it is true of every one of those Black Watch troops. That's up to luck and training now.</p> <p>I'm sure the Black Watch won't mind adding another name to their colours. What they wouldn't want is to look on that name in bitterness.</p>",
  "The last streets of flat-roofed houses of the al-Shuhada district of Falluja peter out into unpaved roads that make their way between the fields to the villages populated by the Zawbi tribe. <p>Under cover of darkness, the fighters of Falluja's resistance creep across this landscape, moving men and weapons from safe houses in the villages towards Shuhada, towards the battle for Falluja. </p> <p>Early yesterday it was US Marine vehicles that were heading into Shuhada, turning out of their forward operating base - a walled former resort of low bungalows round a lake known to Iraqis as 'Dreamland' - for a house raid that US military sources say netted a 'senior leader' in the network run by Jordanian terror mastermind Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, along with five others. He was named as Abdel-Hamid Fiyadh, 50, who was arrested along with his two sons, Walid, 18, and Majid, 25, and three relatives. </p> <p>For a year and more, this is how the war in Falluja has been conducted: at night, raids by American troops seen largely through the green shimmer of their night-vision goggles; by day, block searches and vehicle checkpoints. </p> <p>On the insurgents' side, it has been prosecuted with an equal, if covert, vigour among the back lanes and along the quiet lanes to the south that act as supply routes between other centres for the rebellion. </p> <p>But it is the city itself and districts such as Shuhada that are the centre of gravity of the insurgency, along with the densely concentrated al-Askari neighbourhood on the Euphrates to the city's east, and the district of Johan in the city's north-west. </p> <p>After a year and a half of gun battles, artillery and tank fire and bombing raids, many of the houses of Shuhada are scarred. But Shuhada is on the brink of even greater violence as US and Iraqi forces mass for what they hope will be the definitive battle of the Sunni Triangle. </p> <p>How that battle unfolds will not only hold the key to Iraq's elections in January, and to a joint US-British military strategy, but to the life of Margaret Hassan and perhaps to how history will judge the actions of both George Bush and Tony Blair. </p> <p>It is a battle that will be fought among the metal shops off Highway 10, where it carves into the city of 300,000. It will be fought along the highway itself that neatly bisects Falluja and, eventually, it will be fought in the warren of narrow, filthy lanes of the slums that sit by the Euphrates, where fighters, at first largely from the al-Buesa tribe, first began their rebellion. </p> <p>Even when journalists could still visit the fighters in Falluja, this was a threatening place, where lookouts would stand on the street corners to warn of American troops and other 'spies'. </p> <p>Now the state of the insurgency in Falluja is largely unknown, save that it has taken deep root in the 'City of Mosques' and its surrounding villages, despite claims by the US military that they have waged a bloody campaign of attrition that has bitten deeply into the leadership of both the insurgents and their allies in Zarqawi's militia network. </p> <p>What is equally uncertain is whether US Marines are capable of bringing Falluja back under control without the massive loss of civilian life that accompanied their last major excursion into the city in April, or without large loss of American lives. </p> <p>It is a moot point. For in the run-up to planned elections in Iraq in January, US forces cannot risk rekindling the sense of outrage that joined Sunni and Shia and Kurd when confronted with the death toll in this city. </p> <p>It is for this fight that British troops of the Black Watch are being brought north into Babil province to release more US Marines for the fight. </p> <p>According to military sources, this time the battle will be different - although there is no evidence of that so far from the bombing raids that have been levelled against districts like Shuhada in the past few weeks which, say the city's doctors, have already claimed many lives. </p> <p>This time military planners say the US Marine assaults will be led by special forces, who will pinpoint insurgent positions as they move through the city block by block, pushing the fighters back until they are stopped by the river and trapped by a cordon around the city. </p> <p>That is the theory. Iraq has a nasty habit of turning the theories on their heads. Nowhere more so than here. </p> <p>Falluja was always a disaster waiting to happen. A deeply religious and socially conservative city with a tradition of Baathism, it had been one of the main recruiting areas of Saddam's security forces, including the Republican Guard. </p> <p>When these were disbanded after the fall of the regime, a large proportion of the city's men were excluded from the new Iraq. </p> <p>It was compounded by another problem. Despite the fact there had been no fighting in Falluja, and the city had negotiated its surrender without the looting that had been seen elsewhere, when American troops did move into Falluja it was to preside over an almost immediate disaster. </p> <p>Sixteen Iraqis were killed and dozens more were injured after the American soldiers opened fire on a demonstration. </p> <p>It was the first in a series of fatal misjudgments that allowed the insurgency to establish a foothold in Falluja. In an experiment that would have far-reaching consequences, American troops retreated from their positions inside the city, relocating to two substantial bases on its outskirts. </p> <p>Rapidly, the fighters in Falluja took advantage of the American withdrawal, using it as cover to ambush US patrols with bombs, sometimes even as they left their gates. </p> <p>By the beginning of the year, those attacks were becoming ever more auda cious, culminating in the downing of a Chinook helicopter full of US troops and the murder of a group of American contractors whose burnt and mutilated bodies were hung from a city bridge. </p> <p>The response was the first serious attempt to pacify the city in April, an operation that left hundreds of Iraqis dead, many of them civilians, with little impact on the insurgency. </p> <p>If that was serious enough in its own right, a worse misjudgment was over the nature of the insurgency itself. For months, despite all the evidence to the contrary about its high level of organisation, senior US officers convinced themselves that the attacks were the work of a few dead-enders, foreign fighters or criminals in the town. And they consistently underestimated the numbers of those fighting them. </p> <p>New assessments have radically altered that picture. Across Iraq, US military intelligence officials conceded to the New York Times on Friday, the estimated numbers of fighters now stand at between 8,000 and 12,000, perhaps 20,000 when active sympathisers are included. </p> <p>They are assessments that contrast sharply with earlier intelligence reports, in which the number of insurgents has varied from as few as 2,000 to a maximum of 7,000, with 400 in Falluja. </p> <p>What US military planners now recognise is that the fighters in Falluja could number many more. And, as The Observer reported last weekend, the insurgents have access to huge sums of money from an underground financial network run by former Baath Party leaders and Saddam Hussein's relatives operating from Syria and elsewhere. </p> <p>All of which raises serious new questions over the nature of the insurgency: has it grown out of plans laid down in advance for Iraqis loyal to the old regime to continue the fight? Was the battle for Falluja, in many respects, always destined to happen? </p> <p>The biggest question is how hard the men of Falluja and their allies will fight and whether they will try to make their stand as definitive a turning-point for Iraqis sick of the US 'occupation', just as the American forces hope that it will be for their own project in Iraq. </p> <p>Fort Carson, south of Colorado Springs, is known as the 'Mountain Post'. It is home to 3rd Armoured Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division, and the 43rd Area Support Group. It is also home to a group of men whose reported deployment soon to Iraq threatens to have a significant bearing on Falluja's future. </p> <p>The 10th Special Forces Group has for years been catapulted into action from its base in the Colorado mountains. Now, according to US reports, more than 1,000 of them are heading for the Middle East, amid official reluctance to discuss where they are going or what they will be doing. </p> <p>Speculation has been mounting, however, that such a large movement of the Green Berets, with their specialist snipers, linguists, civil affairs specialists and military intelligence officers, could only be headed for two places - for Afghanistan and an attempt to capture Osama bin Laden or, more likely, to spearhead the fighting inside Falluja, acting as forward air controllers on the ground for US bombers and strike helicopters, and leading the hunt for al-Zarqawi. </p> <p>It is a view that is endorsed by John Pike of the Washington think-tank Global Security. 'The Marine units that are being gathered for the battle are short on laser designation [for guiding air attacks from the ground]. They are significantly under-equipped. A special forces group like this would fill that gap.' </p> <p>Pike believes their deployment , alleged to be within the next couple of weeks, is a possible indicator of the political considerations that surround the timing of a final decisive assault. It must not come so soon that bad news from the battlefield - either in terms of American or civilian casualties - can affect the presidential election. </p> <p>'My guess is that, as soon as the US election count - or recount - starts, you will see an awful lot of action.' </p> <p>But in some respects a campaign has long been under way. Since mid-October the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force has been operating checkpoints around the city, while US jets have launched almost daily raids. </p> <p>The city has been the target of numerous airstrikes by precision-guided missiles destroying suspected hideouts of insurgents. </p> <p>One slim hope remains for the beleaguered citizens of the world's most terrified city. Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi has made Falluja an offer they can't refuse, insisting that the city hand over Zarqawi and his fighters. If they fail to do so, they face a brutal military operation. The events in Falluja over the next few weeks will shape the future of Iraq.</p>",
  "Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Prime Minister, will today seek approval by the Israeli parliament for parts of his plan to withdraw from Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and northern West Bank. <p>The Knesset will be asked to approve legislation on offering settlers compensation to leave their homes. On Tuesday members will vote on the disengagement plan itself. Sharon is expected to win all the votes he requires to begin disengagement, but Israel is approaching this week with a sense of major disquiet. </p> <p>Last week the media was full of fears of an assassination attempt on the Prime Minister and his colleagues. Commentators also predicted that Jewish extremists would attack Palestinians or Muslim targets to unleash a wave of unrest that would destabilise the country and prevent the withdrawals. </p> <p>Dozens of soldiers threatened to disobey orders and resign. Refusal to serve in the army is seen as a cardinal sin because the fate of the army is equated with the fate of the Jewish state. </p> <p>The debate over disengagement has polarised Israelis. Between 60 and 70 per cent are in favour, while the remainder fiercely oppose it. </p> <p>Yoram Peri, a professor of politics and sociology, said that many Israelis had an apocalyptic feeling about the dispute. 'I sometimes feel that the state of Israel is in the balance; then I remember the Afrikaners in South Africa. There were a lot of threats, but when the moment of truth arrived they did nothing and the majority won,' he said. </p> <p>The two sides also represent very different ideas of Israel. The majority represent the secular founding principles of the Zionists, while the minority have combined religion and nationalism, a trend which began after Israel's 1967 conquest of the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights. On Friday there was a large gathering of secular Israelis at the Love Parade in Tel Aviv. Around 100,000 gay and straight people danced and drank all day. On Tuesday tens of thousands of settlers will demonstrate around the Knesset in Jerusalem. </p> <p>The difference between the two groups could not be greater. 'The majority are western, secular, modern, future-orientated, while the settlers are fundamentalists who look back 2,000 years,' said Peri. 'They are xenophobic and anti-democratic. The minority is trying to push around the majority, which is weak and disorganised.' </p> <p>What the settlers lack in numbers they make up for in motivation and organisation. Young settlers marry early and are happy to live in a mobile home in the West Bank and devote their life to advancing their political cause. Secular youth tend be politically uninterested. </p> <p>'I asked some of my students why they were not doing anything,' Peri said. 'They said they were looking after their own interests. Many are getting European passports. </p> <p>'One student told me that many years ago he asked his father if he would get a passport from the country where he was born - Germany. His father said, \"Over my dead body\". Two weeks ago he agreed to do it. The secular rational majority have their own solution to this crisis - we will go abroad.' </p> <p>While Israel focuses on the disengagement plan, life in the Palestinian territories remains brutal. Kieran Prendergast, the UN under secretary-general for political affairs, said that 206 Palestinians and 13 Israelis had been killed in the last month. </p> <p>'Violence, not negotiation, continues to be the all too frequent mode of communication in the Middle East,' he told the council on Friday. 'There is a sense of drift and foreboding; in the case of the occupied Palestinian territory, of drift towards chaos.'</p> <p><b>Voices across the divide</b></p> <p><b>DAVID GROSSMAN</b>, novelist: </p> <p>'It shows how extreme and dangerous our situation is, how we have become polarised, how the hatred for the enemy has filtered into the inner organs of our national system. </p> <p>'What we are seeing is how the settlers have got used to the idea that the state serves as an instrument to realise their messianic hallucinations. They do not accept that the state and the majority wants to change the direction. </p> <p>'I am almost sure the situation will become violent, though I hope reality will defy me. The settlers know the battle on Gaza is lost, but want to make the issue such a national trauma that it will be engraved on the Israeli psyche.' </p> <p><b>YAEL DAYAN</b>, member of the Knesset for left-wing Yahad party. Daughter of Moshe Dayan, Israel's defence minister in the 1967 Six Day War: </p> <p>'There is an idea of a crisis, but it is not just about disengagement. It is whether or not we will move ourselves towards a peace process. </p> <p>'A healthy democratic society should always be ready to end occupation and embrace peace. The talk of civil war frightens me less. If we are strong enough to fight a war, then we are certainly strong enough to fight for peace. We are not strong enough to compromise on our democracy and continue occupation. We do not have an answer to individual acts of fanatical terrorism.' </p> <p><b>DAVID WILDER</b>, Hebron settler: </p> <p>'When the Peel Commission asked David Ben Gurion in 1937 why he had the right to live here, he showed them the Torah. That is the foundation of everything. People have lost faith and the result is this crisis. </p> <p>'We have not come to terms with the fact that we are living in a sovereign state, in our own land. We have come back home and are independent and can make decisions for ourselves. They even question whether we have the right to this land and the right to defend ourselves </p> <p>'Sharon might succeed in uprooting 8,500 people from their homes, but the height of the crisis might come in one year or 10 years.'</p>",
  "It's a safe bet bet that a considerable number of the 20-year-old men who went out clubbing last night woke up this morning with sore heads, bloody noses and a hazy sense of something, somewhere, having gone terribly wrong. Drunken rucks on sticky pavements are not a pretty sight, even by moonlight, but thanks to discounted drinks promotions, Bannockburn-style hand-to-hand combat is now an established part of the urban weekend landscape - just like farmers' markets, and dads reading newspapers by the swings. <p>Unlike your average pent-up wageslave, Prince Harry doesn't save it all up for a weekly clubbing date on a Saturday night. Since he is in a holding pattern between school and Sandhurst, he can go clubbing whenever he chooses. Last week (despite a knee injury which was so bad he was excused from his current charity role of teaching rugby to deprived inner-city kids) he chose to go clubbing on Wednesday evening, a night when the party crowd is made up of 'resting' actors and models, and trustafarians.</p> <p>Early on Thursday morning, after downing some improbably expensive vodka, he walked out of Pangaea, a Mayfair members' club, and into a fight. Also unlike the hundreds of drunks who find that a fairly routine way to round off a night on the razz, he ended up all over the front pages, was obliged to publicly acknowledge his behaviour was 'disappointing', and felt it necessary to apologise to his dad.</p> <p>That incident, at 3.20am with an inexperienced young photographer who may or may not have lamped him with a camera, has done yet more damage to recent efforts to patch up Harry's image.</p> <p>There are problems, you see. Harry isn't exactly bookish. Once upon a time, he had a joint. He likes a party, a drink, pretty girls and Oakley sunglasses. He likes polo and rugby and shooting things. He also likes - and this is where things get more complex - to stake a claim to his mother's humanitarian interests.</p> <p>'I believe I've got a lot of my mother in me, basically,' he told an ITV camera crew as it filmed him helping out in a Lesotho orphanage earlier this year. The shots of him damp-eyed and grim-jawed, cradling infants infected with HIV, shook out other old memories like dust from a carpet. Knowing how greedily possessive the British are of that princess, it was a mistake for Harry to say this: too much of a challenge, too provocative. He's only her son, after all.</p> <p>At 20, burdened with equal quantities of idealism and impulsiveness, not to mention a fairly miserable domestic history, Harry (the 'spare' to William's heir) finds himself in a vulnerable position. His older brother is still in full-time education at St Andrew's which means that - under an agreement between newspaper editors and Clarence House - he remains untouchable. But this protective cloak was removed from Harry's shoulders the moment he left Eton in 2003. And Harry is not as cautious as his older brother. The tabloids are hovering, riding the scandal thermals and waiting for the inevitable moment of weakness.</p> <p>Since taking his A levels, Harry has worked as a jackaroo on an Australian cattle station, as a labourer and care assistant in Lesotho, and as a farmhand on one of his father's Duchy of Cornwall estates. He has also studied for his Royal Commissions Board exams and volunteered for the Rugby Football Union's mentoring programme.</p> <p>Shortly he's due in Argentina, where he will spend six weeks doing work experience on a polo farm. It has been a fre netic and international schedule, designed with Harry's appetite for robust physicality in mind (at school, his room was decorated with a polo stick and a poster of a Canadian skiing resort). The intention was, evidently, to keep the energetic and easily bored prince as occupied as possible.</p> <p>As far as the press is concerned, he is now officially fair game, so the flunkeys who mapped out his diary should be congratulated for keeping him off the front pages for the last 15 months. Of course, there have been the occasional snatched photos of him flicking Vs around celebrity-packed polo parties, and enjoying boozy nights out in sloane zones such as Boujis in Kensington, but overall it has not been a bad first year of full exposure (though big sighs of relief will have been heaved in Clarence House and Highgrove when the Edexcel examining board recently cleared him of cheating in his art A level; a story that emerged when a former teacher sued Eton for unfair dismissal). After the Pangaea incident, however, it's likely that the gloves will come off.</p> <p>There is now a palpable sense of panic about how Harry will occupy himself until January, when he begins his army training. As a senior royal aide says, 'It would be fair to say that there is a sense here that the sooner Prince Harry is under the umbrella of the armed services and starts at Sandhurst the better.'</p> <p>The consensus is that at 19 months his 'gap year' is in danger of stretching everyone's patience. 'He wants to go into the army? Well, he should go into the army and disappear. Stop going to Eurotrash nightclubs. That's his best hope,' says one royal biographer impatiently.</p> <p>Ingrid Seward, author of William and Harry: A Portrait of Two Princes , agrees that Sandhurst represents his best chance of happiness. 'I think it will suit Harry down to the ground: they'll party like mad too. And he'll be quite good at adapting to the discipline of it. He's very gregarious: he's fun, and impulsive, and enjoys doing crazy things. He's pretty fearless - you can see that in his sporting activities - which will stand him in very good stead when he goes into the army, but unfortunately, in his everyday life, he needs to take more care than the rest of us do.'</p> <p>In the past, Harry has been curiously, even admirably, philosophical in his encounters with the press. Considering his pedigree, the legacy of 'Naff off!' and the underage cherry brandy incident (mention of which still makes his father squirm), not to mention the circumstances of his parents' separation and his mother's death, his good humour has often seemed close to freakish.</p> <p>As the ITV documentary proved, he has inherited his mother's impulse to manipulate the media for his own purposes as well as those of charity, and in the past he has impressed photographers with his willingness to participate.</p> <p>'Good as gold,' one called him, after a recent photocall in Southern Africa. 'A joy... chatty, friendly, jokey and cooperative.' He seems far more at ease in these situations than Prince William.</p> <p>But Seward believes that this blokeish display of good humour is just that: a display. 'He has shown real self-control up till now, but there's a lot of anger directed against the paparazzi, and it has to come out at some stage. He shouldn't have done it but you can't blame him: he's a very physical person, so if someone hits him, he's going to lash out. He must have been at the end of his tether... probably a bit pissed too.'</p> <p>Elsewhere, social observers are less surprised by this slip-up, which begins to look overdue, than by his wardrobe ('Was he really out clubbing in jeans and a fleece?' asks one bemused observer from Tatler . 'Really ghastly: typically country. I guess if you're Prince Harry you can get in anywhere, but he really looks like someone who has come up from the country for the night out and couldn't be bothered to make an effort') and by the choice of venue.</p> <p>Boujis, Crazy Larry's, Purple and Embargo are the usual stamping ground for the young royal set: cosy rah hangouts in Kensington, Chelsea and Fulham, where the male dress code is stripy shirts and loafers, and retro cheese from the Eighties and Nineties is on the playlist. Pangaea, the sort of place targeted by people on the make precisely because photographers are always outside, is something else entirely. </p> <p>By blundering into it, Harry made his first mistake: out of his usual comfort zone and surrounded by a different sort of crowd, he lost his bearings. 'I have to say, I was very surprised that he'd been to Pangaea,' says the Tatler commentator. 'It's not at all the sort of place that that crew go to. They don't go to West-Endy places. Harry and Will are very country, very Gloucestershire, and Pangaea is more Footballers' Wives.'</p> <p>Slumped on the back seat of the Mercedes that swept him away from the Mayfair fracas, Harry had the blank, horrified look of a boy facing up to the fact that that he has made a very bad mistake.</p> <p>But Ingrid Seward thinks it's time the rucking royal learned a few harsh lessons. 'The paparazzi may chase him, but the creditors don't. With his position come some pretty good perks. The problem is that with privilege comes responsibility, and Harry hasn't learned that yet.'</p> <p>The sight of that stricken face looked very much like someone stumbling across the moral of their own story. It's a moral he will have to take on board, if he is to continue as a 21st-century prince.</p> <p><b>Prince Harry</b><br> </p> <p><b> Full name: </b>Henry Charles Albert David of Wales </p> <p><b>DoB:</b> 15 September 1984 (St Mary's Hospital, London) </p> <p><b>Occupation:</b> Gap 'year' between Eton and Sandhurst </p> <p><b>Likes:</b> Painting; clubbing </p> <p><b>Dislikes:</b> Photography; being clubbed</p>",
  "Claudia's spike heels clicked along the pavement as she strode into the queue. She pulled her pale brown fake-fur jacket around her shoulders and shivered. Other than a denim micro-skirt there was nothing covering her tanned legs. <p>'This is my favourite nightclub,' she said, pulling a cigarette out of her pocket with perfectly manicured nails. 'We come here because of the celebrities,' she added, giggling through her thick Italian accent. 'Or the celebrities come here to see you,' said a man leering over her shoulder and peering at her cleavage. </p> <p>Her long, blond hair had been curled over pencilled eyebrows and her lips were perfectly lined in deep red. She had come to London from Genoa to study English. </p> <p>We were in the queue for Pangaea, a members' club in Piccadilly. Scores of people were waiting to get in. There were women clutching designer handbags wearing jeans tucked into stiletto boots or short skirts. Men wore shirts, some with the collar pulled up over V-necked jumpers, and leather jackets with cowboy boots. </p> <p>A silver Mercedes pulled up outside and a woman wearing sunglasses and a bandana jumped out. Bouncers pulled aside the red velvet rope and shepherded her inside. Claudia stretched onto her tiptoes to see who it was. 'Oh, just a wannabe,' she said. 'I have seen Tom Parker-Bowles and Eddie Irvine here ... but the main reason I come here is the prince.' </p> <p>She wished she had been there 48 hours earlier. In the early hours of Thursday morning, after a night of dancing and cocktails, Prince Harry left the venue, one of his favourites, to be met by a paparazzi scrum. </p> <p>As one camera accidentally hit him in the face, the 20-year-old lashed out and was accused of lunging at the photographer and screaming 'Why don't you just leave me alone?' before being bundled into a limousine by royal protection officers at 3.15am. </p> <p>The next morning pictures of the brawl were sent around the world and appeared on the front of every British national newspaper. Harry quickly apologised to his father for the fracas, but his spokesman insisted yesterday that he would not be apologising to the photographer. </p> <p>'I don't think it really requires it,' said Paddy Harverson, adding it was just a scuffle that was 'unfortunate' and 'regretful' and the photographers had been more pushy than usual. Harverson said: 'Put yourself in his position. He was coming out of a club and he got absolutely mobbed by the photographers. OK, he lost his temper, it does happen, let's not get it all out of proportion. Let's cut him some slack.' </p> <p>Harverson also responded to claims that the prince's lifestyle is out of control, following reports of drinking and partying. 'What do you want him to do? Stay indoors all day? By and large, his behaviour has been excellent.' </p> <p>When Harry does go out in London he picks from a string of exclusive clubs in Chelsea, South Kensington and Piccadilly including Pangaea, Chinawhite, Boujis, the 151 Club and bars such as The Collection and Bardo. I spent Friday night in three of the clubs to discover their appeal. </p> <p>Early in the evening at Boujis, in South Kensington, each of the few dozen people inside the beautifully decorated red and purple venue was drinking champagne. </p> <p>In the middle of the dance floor one girl with skin-tight black trousers tucked into brown cowboy boots and a low-cut top was dancing seductively in front of a man. She pulled her long black hair on top of her head and snaked her body down to the floor as he leant back on the bar and watched with amusement in his eyes. Most of the tables were empty but you could not sit on them because they were all reserved. Tables within booths were stacked with bottles of vodka. The most expensive thing on the menu was a \u00a3500 bottle of Veuve Clicquot Vintage 1995. </p> <p>It was a far cry from Pangaea where the manager boasted to me that they had a \u00a315,000 bottle of champagne on the menu. There the night was hotting up more quickly. A man painted in gold with a tiger print wrap around his waist beckoned us in. </p> <p>People were dancing on the tables to commercial dance music. Exclusive booths reserved for the more wealthy members lined the dance floor. A stream of waiters carried trays loaded with cocktails into the even more exclusive VIP area that was out of sight. </p> <p>I headed on to Chinawhite. Outside people were getting frustrated as they waited to get in. I asked what the two queues were for. Without looking at me the bouncer flung one arm to the right and said 'guest list,' and the other to the left and spat 'members'. </p> <p>There was no room for anyone else and even those on the guest list were struggling to get in. At 1am the bouncer shouted: 'No more guest list, members only,' and the 50-odd people who had waited for more than an hour were sent away. Even a man claiming to be the owner's cousin was given his marching orders without question. Part of the appeal of these clubs is that those who do get in feel privileged in doing so. </p> <p>The dark interior was decorated with scores of wooden parasols in striking colours hanging from the ceiling. A throng of people were grinding to chart and R&amp;B. </p> <p>There was anger at the bouncers because of the numbers who had been turned away. 'It is our friend's birthday and she hired a table, but still didn't get in,' said Julie, a law student. 'Apparently someone with \"influence\" decided they wanted extra tables so they just took other people's.' </p> <p>'If you have influence here they worship you,' sniped her friend. I met a lot of students - studying law, business and medicine and one trainee nurse called Katie who said she was there because her Italian friend knew the owner. Lots of people said they were there because a friend of a friend knew the owner. Clearly the owner was a very popular man. </p> <p>The women seemed younger than the men, and there were a lot of male investment bankers in their mid-40s. Lots of the guests were European, mainly from Italy, France and Spain. </p> <p>One man was trying to recruit people for an after party. 'There will be cocaine and champagne,' he promised. </p> <p>For Harry, the appeal of these clubs is clear. He is given the privacy he needs with a well-guarded VIP section, table service with a limitless supply of champagne and cocktails, music and dancing and plenty of beautiful women more than happy to throw themselves at celebrities. What 20-year-old would turn that down?</p>",
  "<p>It was, said a bewitched, bothered and bewildered Boris, 'a media jamboree'. He'd gone to Liverpool to abase himself before ordinary people, and there weren't any. Well, one bloke in the park had been quite decent. But the rest of Woeful Wednesday was clamouring sketchwriters, shouting television reporters, radio phone-in ragings and useless Tory minders. </p> <p>The editor of the Spectator and shadow culture minister, having finished his 'I'm sorry I caused offence' column for the Telegraph, was stuck pleading for mercy around Merseyside on what Simon Hoggart in the Guardian called an 'avoid the people' tour. Mr Johnson did his gallant best not to grovel entirely: 'It would be mad to say I had undergone a pre-frontal lobotomy and everything I said last week was inoperative.' </p> <p>He didn't agree with Michael Howard that everything in that incendiary editorial about the mourning of Ken Bigley was 'nonsense from start to finish'. </p> <p>He gallantly denied that he'd gone to the 'Pool because his leader had told him to. 'Humble pie' was already on Boris's menu, apparently. </p> <p>'And, in any event, Johnson the politician apologises for and refuses to apologise for exactly the same things as Johnson the editor.' </p> <p>That was a dig at those (like the Spectator's own media commentator, Stephen Glover) who think that independent editing and shadow cabinet collective discipline are a toxic mix, that one or the other will have to go. We'll have to see whether the Barclay brothers agree. But one thing was utterly clear after Boris's chaotic ordeal, and another, deeper thing was struggling into focus. </p> <p>The clear thing was that Mr Howard had done himself, his party and his shadow spokesman absolutely no favours by denouncing him or sending him north. The Mail scoffed at 'the Clouseaus from Central Office'. Nobody had a good word for a decision that made the party and its leader look as shambolic as Boris himself. The old saw that no publicity is bad publicity went straight off Pier Head. Everybody lost every which way. </p> <p>But the deeper, fuzzier thing was more neuralgic than that. A media jamboree? Absolutely. From start to finish. David Cottrell, a shrewd magazine editor living and working in Liverpool, was in touch with me to describe what he saw with vivid disgust. </p> <p>'Liverpool's collective reaction to the Bigley story (barring the initial revulsion and sympathy) was as indolent and low-grade as everywhere else,' he said. </p> <p>'However, anyone from outside the city could be forgiven for doubting this, because the ITN news bandwagon duly pitched up outside that street in Walton, while the local BBC North West news programme ran its very own \"Liverpool Mourns\" special live from the Metropolitan Cathedral (which was pretty much empty because the rest of us were getting on with our lives). And on and on it went. The entire reportage of the city's \"grief\" was a media construct, excruciatingly predictable and self-fulfilling. In short, a load of bollocks. </p> <p>'True to its cannibalistic tendencies, the Fourth Estate then savages the same story to which it had given birth, so Liverpool ends up execrated for something it simply hasn't done. </p> <p>'Then up comes soft lad Johnson (who clearly hadn't the wit or spite to write the article), out come the cameras to capture it all for (pre)posterity, and once again the public wants what the public gets.' </p> <p>It's one view, of course, and not everyone will agree with it. Indeed, given the miasmic nature of events - real, horrible and confected - not everyone could possibly agree. </p> <p>But look at the clown's nose for Boris put there by the Liverpool Daily Post. Consider the chortlings of the sketch writers who know that this can't be serious (except for Johnson's career prospects). Try to take seriously the proposition that radio phone-ins speak for a whole community - and that one Bigley brother (calling from Amsterdam again) owns that franchise. Then you know what put the jam in jamboree. </p> <p>(And David Cottrell was at least right on one more thing: Boris ,according to the Times, didn't write that editorial. It was mostly the work of our old chum, Simon Heffer, who couldn't make it to Liverpool himself. Too busy writing a piece for the Mail entitled 'This arrogant flouting of democracy'). </p> <p><strong>When race is a numbers game</strong></p> <p>Numbers tell two kind of stories when you come (like a Society of Editors' working party) to examine the number of journalists from ethnic minorities employed by newspapers in towns and cities with big ethnic communities. Take 10 such papers from Bradford to Leeds to Uxbridge and what do you find? Total staffing, 634 journalists. Total ethnic staffing, 28. </p> <p>Some, like the Manchester Evening News , have results to show for a deal of effort: six journalists out of 112. Some, like the Yorkshire Evening Post , can't trouble the scorer at the moment: nought out of 68. 'Room for improvement,' says the working party, a bit bleakly. </p> <p>Roger Borrell of the Birmingham Evening Mail (seven out of 93) utterly seconds that. 'When I arrived in the office as editor three years ago it was like walking into the Johannesburg Star in 1952. There were plenty of black people around, but there was one minority ethnic journalist on the staff then. I had to do something about it. You can't reflect the community unless you reflect its mix.' </p> <p>So why is ethnic recruiting so sticky? Any single answer, of course, is an over-simplification, but one crops up repeatedly. </p> <p>'I often hear that \"Dad wants me to be a solicitor\",' says Borrell. And Perry Austin-Clarke at the Bradford Telegraph and Argus sings a similarly song. It is 'almost impossible' to find minority ethnic recruits, he says. </p> <p>Even in aspirational communities like Leicester, journalists aren't seen as having much of a career - not like doctors, lawyers or accountants. They're thought of as badly paid and low down the social scale. Quite so. It's those numbers again, ringing hollow on pounds, pride and sense.</p> <p><strong>Private prince?</strong></p> <p>Picture of po-faced, sober prince leaving Sunday school? A tenner if you're lucky. Picture of red-faced prince bopping snapper and being restrained by coppers? Anything up to \u00a310,000, according to the Telegraph, front page guaranteed. </p> <p>What's to be done, apart from encouraging Harry to emerge from Sunday school rather than trendy Mayfair nightclubs at 3am? Clarence House won't complain to the Press Complaints Commission. The prince is about to become a trainee army officer. Time to grow up. Freelance snappers, cut lips or not, will still stalk. </p> <p>The obvious palace answer is to do what Princess Caroline of Monaco did: sue, under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to protect her privacy. She won. She can't be stalked in Mayfair at 3am. So Harry could become a pretty private person if he wanted. But is that - with all the red-top wrath involved - quite what the palace wants either? There's a de facto privacy law now, but you can be too rich and famous to use it.</p> <p><strong>Who can fill Lynda's shoes?</strong></p> <p>She had 'almost a family relationship' with her readers, wrote Paul Dacre, making one of his rare solo trips above the Daily Mail parapet. Her genius 'was putting into easy, eloquent words what millions of ordinary people were thinking'. And many more eloquent words right across the press spectrum seconded that. As her editor said, Lynda Lee-Potter had been 'the First Lady of Fleet Street' for more than three decades, a memorably talented columnist and interviewer. </p> <p>Who'll be the next First Lady? There's bound to be one, just as Lee-Potter supplanted Jean Rook after the original inspiration for Private Eye's Glenda Slag moved to the Express, but it's difficult to spot a favourite monarch-in-waiting. </p> <p>Melanie Phillips, the Mail's main moralising woman, doesn't really count Fleet Street as her beat. Sue Carroll at the Mirror and Jane Moore at the Sun are crisp, smart professionals without, as yet, quite the added magic (If only fate had made him a Rosemary Littlejohn!). Julie Burchill wanders lonely as a black cloud through the bewildering thickets and glades of Saturday's Times. Some talented contenders, such as Catherine Bennett of the Guardian, take a contrary - not head-on - look at life, and others, such as Sarah Sands at the Telegraph, have a whole lot of heavy duty editing to do as well. </p> <p>Perhaps the two closest fits for Dacre's basic prescription - absolute synergy with their readers - are Deborah Orr at the Indy and Alison Pearson on the Standard, but there's maybe too much of what Paul uncharitably calls 'liberal bien pen sans opinion' in such quarters. So Lynda Lee-Potter will be a very tough act to follow, which is really just another way of concluding (with Gordon Brown actually) that she'll be 'sorely missed'.</p>",
  "<p>Bank executives appeared before the Treasury Select Committee last week to be grilled about their lending habits. The timing was apposite: on Thursday, Citizens Advice released figures showing that 35,000 more people sought help from its advice centres for consumer debt last year than in the previous year. Debt drove a total of 706,000 people to seek help. </p> <p>At this rate one million people a year will be seeking consumer debt advice within a decade. </p> <p>And that is just with one counselling service. At the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, advisers are seeing an increasing number of cases where individuals have six-figure sums outstanding to card and loan companies. </p> <p>Increasingly, counsellors feel that lending practices are one of the main factors in the growth of unmanageable debt. There have been several cases of suicides by individuals weighed down by horrendous borrowing. Lenders continue to deny that they are too free with credit, but common sense suggests that, for a significant and growing number of people, it is too easy to get a loan, or two, or five. </p> <p>One theory for solving this problem is for lenders to be required to share 'white' information on credit applications. They should be able to see how many cards and loans an individual has and how they behave with those loans. Changes in circumstances is still one of the main reasons for debts becoming unmanageable, but it is much more likely that this will happen if someone has six credit cards, a credit limit of \u00a350,000, a car loan and a mortgage. </p> <p>Some debt specialists question how effective data sharing will be if lenders do not make effective use of it; they may choose only to pay for selected information, for example. Concerns have also been raised about whether lenders can record and share full information without breaching data protection legislation, but this is surely not insurmountable. Another idea is for lenders to ask loan applicants to give more information about income and outgoings to assess whether they can really afford the new commitment they want to take on. </p> <p>This would slow down the process, which might frustrate companies and customers alike, but it could be the check that both need. There are faults on both sides but lenders have the power to prevent the proliferation of debt-related tragedies.</p>",
  "<p>If you did a psychological profile of the corporation, what would it look like? Self-interested, manipulative, avowedly asocial, self-aggrandising, unable to accept responsibility for its own actions or feel remorse - as a person, the corporation would probably qualify as a full-blown psychopath. </p> <p>Sensationalist? Joel Bakan, whose provocative film documentary, The Corporation, is due out at this month and whose book of the same is in the shops (Constable, \u00a39.99), doesn't think so. </p> <p>The opposite of a blunderbuss-wielding Michael Moore, Bakan is a Canadian law professor whose brief is as well-ordered, concise and sober as the accusation is grave: behind its benevolent face, he argues, the most important institution of modern capitalism is a Frankenstein's monster that has broken its chains and is now consuming the society that created it. </p> <p>Three key legal interventions have made the corporation what it is, Bakan says. The first two were the innovations of limited liability and the granting to the corporation of a legal personality. At a stroke, 'the corporate person had taken the place, at least in law, of the real people who owned corporations'. And the company, previously dependent on government grant and charter, could now be seen as an independent being, a 'natural entity' with the same rights to exist as an individual. </p> <p>The corporation turned out to be a work of genius, a brilliant amplifier of capital and effort that has made possible the sensational improvements in living standards (in the developed world) of the past 150 years. But it is a flawed genius, and the flaw, perhaps fatal, is the third enabling condition: exclusive emphasis on profit. </p> <p>This is expressed in the book's subtitle, The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power. On the basis of case law, Bakan insists, 'managers and directors have a legal duty to put shareholders' interests above all others' and no authority to serve any other interests - the 'best interests of the corporation' principle. </p> <p>The combination of these three conditions (Bakan could have added a fourth, which is that, unlike a human being, the corporation has no natural life span. It can in effect live and get bigger for ever) has far-reaching consequences. </p> <p>The first is that among the interests the corporation has no business serving are those of the society that framed its governing rules. In the interests of shareholders, the corporation is not only entitled but obliged to offload on to others as many of the costs of making profits as possible. </p> <p>In short, says shareholder activist Bob Monks, quoted by Bakan, the corporation is 'an externalising machine, in the same way that a shark is a killing machine' - not because it's malevolent but because that's the way it is designed. This in turn makes the whole notion of corporate social responsibility a logical nonsense, permissible only when it is in the best interests of the corporation (in which case it's not corporate social responsibility) or when, ironically, it is insincere (ditto). </p> <p>CSR, says Bakan baldly, 'is an oxymoron'. You might just as well ask a great white to be nice to fish or a fox to go vegetarian. When it comes down to it, responsibility always takes second place to shareholder interests, in the name of which corporations constantly test the edges of legality and far overstep those of morality. </p> <p>This truly is a world where, as he says, legal compliance is just another cost-benefit analysis. Bakan has hair-raising and gruesomely entertaining sections on spying, cheating and amazingly unethical marketing devices. He also notes three pages of alleged legal breaches by corporate role model GE; sweatshops turning out goods for Nike and Wal-Mart and American companies' reluctance to cease their involvement in Nazi Germany because it was good business for their shareholders. </p> <p>Extraordinarily, Bakan recounts a fortunately inept but serious (and authenticated) business-backed plan to depose Roosevelt and install a fascist regime in the US in the 1930s. </p> <p>The corporation has been much more successful by persuasion, to the extent that swathes of what used to be the public sphere and interest have been surrendered to it. And it still wants more. </p> <p>But as the dominance grows, so do the flaws. In a nightmare version of the effect of the invisible hand, everyone pursuing their own self-interest increasingly produces results no one wants or intends (in the extreme, planetary collapse), but for which no one is responsible. And the pathologically narrow and materialistic view of human nature that underpins today's corporate form not only dominates economic activity - it is also altering humanity. </p> <p>'In a world where anything or anyone can be owned, manipulated, and exploited for profit, everything and everyone will eventually be,' Bakan warns. The sorcerer's apprentice is running amok; the corporation is remaking us in its own stunted and undersocialised image. </p> <p>This lucid and urgent book does leave a couple of stones unturned. It perhaps overestimates the global hegemony of the US model (although not its fundamentalist zeal for hegemony); shareholders certainly own rights in companies, but the assets themselves? </p> <p>Then again it underestimates, or rather does not address, the formidable extent to which the model is underpinned by dominant academic theory. And, perhaps not surprisingly, Bakan's remedies are less well thought-out than his cool and authorititative analysis. </p> <p>He is, though, undoubtedly right that it's time to destroy the pernicious and self-serving idea of the corporation as a 'natural entity'. It's not. It has a right to exist because society gave it one. </p> <p>The corporation was created as an instrument of public policy, and its licence can still, theoretically, be revoked. The presumption of freedom from regulation is otiose. The corporation needs to be re-made in our image - in law, in theory and in practice. </p> <p><strong>The killer instinct </strong></p> <p>It should not come as no surprise that corporations often operate right at the edge of legality; they are explicitly told there's competitive advantage in pushing it to the limit. </p> <p>Thus, in a Harvard Business Review article (since made into a book), tellingly entitled Hardball: Five Killer Strategies for Trouncing the Opposition, two prominent consultants advised that hardball players (ie winners) systematically probe the narrow strip of territory - 'so rich in possibilities' - between the areas society clearly sanctions and those it clearly outlaws. </p> <p>Since the line that separates the two is often blurred, 'by aggressively pushing the limits of existing regulations, a hardball player can sometimes win tremendous competitive advantages'. </p> <p>In short, business is amoral; its only social obligation is to make money within the law. Any source of competitive advantage is legitimate. So winners will operate closer to the legal boundary than losers. Sometimes they will go over the edge - hence Bakan's list of transgressions. </p> <p>Hence, too, an Enron, which far from being an aberration in this context can be seen as an extreme manifestation of the hardball culture that makes self-interest paramount and invalidates moral concerns - a symptom, as Bakan says, 'of the corporation's flawed institutional character'.</p>",
  "<p>The Today programme presenter John Humphrys is about to publish a book called Lost for Words on the mangling and manipulation of the English language. It should be fascinating. </p> <p>For words and their manipulation have been and remain a point at issue over this past year and more, since Humphrys' interview with Andrew Gilligan on 29 May last year dynamised the debate within and around the media. </p> <p>The evidence is that some of the rich and powerful men and women who command broadcasting use words to prove their case and bolster their position, but not with precision. </p> <p>The main and most recent example of this is Greg Dyke, the former director-general of the BBC, who, in the James Cameron Memorial Lecture last Monday, presented himself as a man fired from that job because he refused to compromise a principled stand, in defending and refusing to apologise for Gilligan's story. </p> <p>In the course of it, he called a book I published earlier this year, What the Media are Doing to our Politics, 'deeply dishonest' and 'fundamentally flawed': and I want to return these charges to him. </p> <p>But John Humphrys also had a go. In his McTaggart Lecture at this year's Edinburgh International TV Festival he mocked my book, saying it was remarkable that a journalist should write that the media posed a threat to democratic institutions, that threat being (as he quoted me) 'at its greatest when the media are at their most fearless'. Remarkable it would have been: but it isn't what the book said. It said, on page 13, that such a threat was 'at its greatest when the media are apparently at their most fearless'. </p> <p>'Apparently' changes everything. It so qualifies the adjective it precedes as to turn it into its opposite. It also promises a revelation. It is the patron word of journalism; it says: 'This appears to be so, but wait: I'll tell you it isn't.' </p> <p>Humphrys knows this perfectly well: he's written a book about words. The omission cannot be because he doesn't know the weight of 'apparently'. Either he didn't read the book he slams, and a researcher gave him the quote wrong, carelessly or deliberately, or he read it, and misquoted deliberately. </p> <p>That journalism is 'dangerous because it's fearless' isn't what I either believe or have practised. To be misquoted by an arbiter of truth, journalism and the use of words so that it appears I do believe it is a serious matter, and he owes an apology. </p> <p>Greg Dyke's was a still more serious criticism, and a more serious case. The former DG now presents himself as the Alexander Solzhenitsyn of Portland Place. It is beguiling when framed in Dyke's demotic style: but it is false and based on the same hollow foundations as Humphrys' charge: the misunderstanding, deliberate or insouciant, of the meaning and power of words. </p> <p>First, Dyke's presentation depends on a view of himself as one concerned for years with government's tendency to erode broadcasting freedom. He quoted his own McTaggart Lecture 10 years ago, in which he warned that the independence of journalists would come under threat. He said then he was 'concerned about self censorship; that broadcasting organisations would be wary of running programmes or stories which might upset the government of the day'. </p> <p>Yet his own concern as DG was not for strengthening current affairs. On the contrary: the news was shifted and diluted, Panorama was moved to late on Sunday night and BBC1 and BBC2 were given over to controllers fiercely dismissive of any programmes that might cut into their driving concern, high ratings. </p> <p>His largest intervention into news and current affairs was to appoint a business editor on a par with political and foreign affairs editors - in order, as he explained to a CBI conference, to counter the BBC's anti-business bias. Business journalists can be great: but they are not appointed to get 'stories which might upset the government of the day'. </p> <p>Dyke's concern - he was largely successful in this - was to make the BBC dominant in ratings: the assumption among the leaders of the broadcasting industry, from which he showed no signs of deviating, has been that news and current affairs is no help in that aim. </p> <p>Second, he asserts continually that Gilligan's story was 'overwhelmingly true', and his defence of it principled. But the Gilligan story wasn't true. The core of it was that the Prime Minister had lied to the country to persuade it to go to war (read the transcript of the story if you don't believe it: it's rambling, but if words have meaning, that's what it says - twice. And Gilligan said it again, on Radio 5 and on Radio 2). No evidence was available at the time to prove it; Dr Kelly did not say that to Gilligan. </p> <p>It is a sensational charge: the kind of thing that causes governments to fall. To make it, any serious news organisation would have to collect its evidence over a sustained period; check it with lawyers; check and re-check its sources; announce the story as one of grave national concern; and prepare to defend it against attack. None of this happened. </p> <p>The story trickled out; the BBC editors realised it had gone too far; they blurred the charge without explanation on Radio 4. Hutton thought that the dossier being 'sexed up' should, in the context of the earlier broadcast, be taken to mean an implication of deliberate mendacity. It's the most reasonable judgment. </p> <p>This is what Dyke is defending, and on which he's building his reputation. He pads his pitch with lots of stuff about how the claims on WMD have been shown to be wrong: and that's true, but irrelevant. There is a large and continuing issue about the nature of the intelligence; about its presentation; about the validity and legality of the war. It does not touch the central core. </p> <p>The James Cameron prize was given, just before Dyke's speech, to John Ware, the BBC's pre-eminent investigative reporter. Ware had made a fine Panorama - for once in its proper, mid-evening position - on the Gilligan affair, a remarkably rapidly assembled and accurate account that showed the flaws in both the government's and his own corporation's case. In a recent number of the BBC staff newspaper, Ariel, Ware and other Panorama colleagues took time to stress - in the face of Dyke's book - that 'however you try to read them, [Gilligan's broadcasts] are not supported by the evidence'. </p> <p>In his speech of thanks, Ware spoke of a current affairs culture badly hit by a broadcasting leadership that has little interest in it. The main target of his speech - he was too civilised to say so - sat behind him, waiting to speak in his turn. </p> <p>And then, when he did speak, Dyke dismissed Lord Hutton as a judge whose one public inquiry was into the re-routing of a river in Northern Ireland, and whom he (Dyke) 'suspects' was chosen because, as a former Diplock judge, 'he was known for not liking journalists and he lived very closely with the security services'. </p> <p>Hutton lived with the security services because, like other Northern Ireland judges, his life was continually in danger. To misrepresent a mark of courage as one of lack of independence of judgment was the lowest point of a low speech. </p> <p>'Dishonest' and 'fundamentally flawed' - a description of how Dyke is now acting, in his rage to be vindicated. But it's too late to appear as a tribune of the people. For that to ring true, you have to have right on your side. </p> <p>And Dyke is wrong - and in being wrong, he doesn't care whom he wrongs, including the English language.</p>",
  "<p>Old hands among the Baghdad media can spot the most obvious warning signs. Sometimes it is the BMW filled with tough-faced young guys that circles the block one time too often, or cruises past you on the road and slows to check your vehicle. </p> <p>It is the middle-aged man who sits all day outside the heavily guarded entrance to your hotel and gets up to follow you when you walk out for the third time that day to get into your car and notes down your licence plate. </p> <p>It is the tracksuited man who followed us around Fallujah like a ghost, the gun in his waistband revealed by a fortuitous gust of wind that opened up his jacket. </p> <p>These are ones who are incompetent or cocky or unlucky. You fear most the watchers you cannot see. </p> <p>The security personnel who work for many of the larger media organisations call this being 'dicked'. </p> <p>It was given a graphic illustration earlier this month with the kidnapping of Australian television journalist John Martinkus, who was released after his captors checked his bona fides on the internet. During his captivity he learned - to his shock - that he had been stalked for three days, without knowing it, before he was snatched. </p> <p>Since April, amid kidnappings and murders of Westerners in Iraq, the 'dicking' of the media has reached such epidemic proportions that few journalists who remain in Baghdad feel either safe or able to function at their job as organisations and individual journalists have voted with their feet and left Iraq. </p> <p>In a process that has echoed the perilous peace after the first Chechen war when kidnapping became rife, Iraq is slowly becoming a story too dangerous to cover. </p> <p>The closure of Iraq to the western media has been a slow and grinding process. Staff have been reduced or withdrawn - at the time of writing Newsweek and Time do not have staff correspondents on the ground - while those that do remain are reduced to operating either with armed guards or are trapped in their hotels. </p> <p>Inexorably, the rest of the country has followed, major road by major road, district by district, until even the short drive from Baghdad International Airport to the city centre has become a lethal lottery. The media in Iraq has been forced to use Iraqi assistants as their eyes and ears, putting Iraqi staff in the front line. </p> <p>It was recently and powerfully described by the Washington Post's indefatigable correspondent Rajiv Chandrasekaran as 'journalism by remote control... deprived of detail, intimacy. Deprived of a degree of reporting depth and on-the-ground observation seen through the eyes of a foreign correspondent.' </p> <p>It is not only Chandrasekaran who felt he had become a prisoner of Baghdad. Recently Farnaz Fassihi of the Wall Street Journal wrote an email that percolated through the Baghdad corps and that summed up the views of many. </p> <p>'Being a foreign correspondent in Baghdad these days is like being under virtual house arrest,' declared Fassahi. </p> <p>'I am house bound. I leave when I have a very good reason to and a scheduled interview. I avoid going to people's homes and never walk in the streets. I can't strike a conversation with strangers, can't look for stories, can't drive in anything but a full armoured car, can't go to scenes of breaking news stories, can't be stuck in traffic, can't speak English outside, can't take a road trip, can't say I'm an American, can't linger at checkpoints, can't be curious about what people are saying, doing, feeling. And can't and can't...' </p> <p>For television crews an assignment in Baghdad is now largely about rooftop 'stand-ups' on their hotel, travel outside the main locations - the Sheraton/Palestine hotel compound and the al-Hamra hotel - is a rarity. Some US networks, including NBC, have long been protected by armed guards - most of them former British Marines. </p> <p>Others, such as CNN, have devised ways of protecting the half-dozen or so foreign staff from various risks that include the chilling scenario of their hotel being overrun by gunmen intent on widespread murder. </p> <p>In December it was possible to 'commute' from Baghdad to cities such as Fallujah, to meet insurgent leaders and cover the story from both sides. Within a few months, however, Fallujah would be closed, and to visit would be to risk disaster. </p> <p>Others have simply left. Tim Lambon is a freelance television producer with a background in security who works largely for Channel 4, often also fulfilling the role of 'safety officer' for his crew. </p> <p>'What makes Iraq so difficult is that people are being kidnapped and killed,' he said last week. 'In this job you take into account the risk from mortars and rockets, but what do you do about a threat like this? </p> <p>'It was bad enough in Beirut in the Eighties when you were looking at throwing away three years of your life as a hostage. But in Iraq these guys are killing people pretty fast and not hanging on to them. </p> <p>'The hostile environment courses used to teach you to deal with this by being the \"grey man\" if you were kidnapped. I went on a refresher recently and the advice is now fight and flight. Even then there is fuck all you can do if two cars pull up and box you in front and back.' </p> <p>Lambon is pessimistic about how long journalists can remain under the present conditions, a pessimism that is shared by many, including Mitch Prothero, former bureau chief in Baghdad for UPI and until recently a research assistant for the Committee to Protect Journalists. </p> <p>Prothero is one of those who has recently left, saying: 'As far as I'm concerned you can't cover this story at the moment. Essentially it is all over. It is a terrible choice. It is the biggest story in the world and there is a terrible obligation to cover it. But you don't put just yourself at risk, but your Iraqi staff and anyone who you interview or whose home you visit. </p> <p>'I remember earlier in the year someone from the Coalition Press Information Centre [the US military press centre in Baghdad] saying: \"This is an active combat zone and we don't want to protect you. Either you embed with us or go home.\" Well, now I think I agree. </p> <p>'It used to be the case that the most dangerous thing I felt I could do was sit in a US military vehicle. Now it is the only thing you can really do.' </p> <p>Will I go back? I would like to say yes - because of the Iraqi friends I've made, and because I feel we have a duty to go on reporting what is happening in Iraq. Because it is the biggest story in the world. Because it is what we do. </p> <p>But increasingly my heart and head rejects it.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Beauty Queen's Guide To World Peace</strong><br> Dan Plesch</p> <p>Politico's \u00a38.99, pp373 </p> <p>We are in a mess. The world's resources are disappearing; global warming will shortly have us canoeing to work; hope for an international order based on the rule of law is disappearing; the gap between the world's rich and poor is widening; and much of the West is littered with radioactive junk.

Globalisation, he says, marks not 'the end of history' but the beginning of a unified human story. Unfortunately, it will be a short story with a tragic ending unless we follow his remedy. </p> <p>The Plesch prescription comprises a large dose of idealism washed down with pragmatism. So his strategy draws on the 'millennium goals' agreed by the United Nations in 2000 - prosperity, security, justice and so on - but also on the British army's doctrine for counterinsurgency warfare. The latter, formulated by General Frank Kitson in the 1970s, insists that 'there can be no such thing as a purely military solution because insurgency is not primarily a military activity'. Instead, Kitson said, success requires various key elements, including good intelligence, a high degree of co-ordination of any overall plan, the creation of a favourable political atmosphere allowing the redress of legitimate grievances and a strict adherence to the law by 'the imperial power'. Read that list carefully. Then think about the strategy so far pursued in 'the war on terror'. </p> <p>Most of the book is taken up with careful policy suggestions. They include greater accountability of big business (largely through the restriction of corporations' current limited legal liability), the strengthening of global democracy by having directly elected representatives on global bodies, enforcing existing arms reduction treaties and, most critically, a shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. </p> <p>The latter can be achieved within two decades, Plesch argues. Once done, we will be free of our dependence on Gulf oil (and nuclear power), free of the threat of global warming and able to tackle the root causes of modern Islamic militancy in the Middle East while also denying terrorists the 'nightmare scenario' targets of the power infrastructure. This is clearly a no-brainer. I doubt Bush or Blair will read this book, but they should.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Leonardo da Vinci: The Flights of the Mind</strong><br>by Charles Nicholl<br>Penguin/Allen Lane \u00a325, pp640</p> <p>No man is a hero to his valet or his biographer, and Charles Nicholl, in this bright, cunning, intrepidly intelligent biographical study, has startlingly demystified his enigmatic subject. Nineteenth-century historians canonised Leonardo as a universal intelligence, the embodiment of the superhuman aspiration that impelled the Renaissance. In The Reckoning, Nicholl examined the career of another reckless spiritual rebel, Christopher Marlowe, entangling this Faustian transgressor in a sordid Elizabethan underworld of thuggery, buggery and treason. He has done something equally brisk and disrespectful to Leonardo.</p> <p>It's true, as his subtitle concedes, that Leonardo nurtured an Icarus-like dream of flight, designing a velocopter and studying bat wings as a prototype for a manned fly ing-machine. Nevertheless, Nicholl grounds him. Flight, he argues, is not necessarily the Renaissance man's desire to reclaim equality with the angels; it may also signify, as it does for the rest of us, a fugitive longing to evade responsibility and interrupt work - 'flights semantically referrable to as fleeing rather than flying'.</p> <p>He begins with Leonardo, near the end of his life, scrawling an impatient 'etcetera' on a sheet of geometrical notes as he abandons the labour of cogitation. The soup, Leonardo adds to explain his impatience, is getting cold. Nicholl enjoys the grubby, humanising domestic detail; it doesn't occur to him that Leonardo might have been about to formulate the second law of thermodynamics.</p> <p>Occasionally, Nicholl allows Leonardo to enjoy a moment of sublimated mental triumph, as when he stands on top of Brunelleschi's Duomo in Florence, elated by 'the precisely calibrated magic which could throw up this gravity-defying structure halfway to heaven'.</p> <p>But, for the most part, averse to hagiography and to what he calls 'Leonardolatry', Nicholl seeks out lowly explanations for his subject's almost maniacal creativity. Thus, his output of 'written material', secretively scribbled back to front with the aid of a mirror, loses its arcane obsessiveness and is treated as a hangover from the dreary trade of his father, who was a notary - 'the inscriber of transactions, the official noter-down'.</p> <p>Earlier biographers euphemised Leonardo's sexual leanings, preferring to believe that his relations with his apprentices were chastely Platonic. Nicholl is blunter. He relishes the 'Leonardian light relief' of a notebook that speculates on the canine habit of bottom-sniffing and is hardly less explicit when dealing with Leonardo's attraction to his shiftless and dishonest bum-boy Salai. But he also takes a brusque delight in manoeuvring Leonardo, whose Florentine cronies joked about his partiality for the back door, into a belated act of heterosexual intercourse with a courtesan called Cremona.</p> <p>The avian thinker is implicated with the jumped-up warlords who ran Italy during his lifetime. Leaving Florence for Milan, Nicholl's Leonardo ingratiates with the Sforza clan. He paints portraits of their concubines (like the sleek, pampered Lady with an Ermine) and sketches tanks, mortars and bombards to be used in their military campaigns. Later, he places his engineering skills at the service of Machiavelli. When the French king vaingloriously rides into the city he had conquered, Nicholl is dismayed to find Leonardo stage-managing the victory parade. Even worse is his employment as a trivial court-jester, dreaming up quizzical party-pieces and punning cryptograms for his patrons.</p> <p>The change of emphasis is bracing and Nicholl writes with keen excitement about Leonardo's anatomical investigations, conducted by messily dissected and putrid corpses sometimes scavenged from the gallows. He is also thrilled by the diagrams of water, in which Leonardo struggles to comprehend the chaotic flux of created nature. But when he comes to the iconic works venerated by the 19th century - The Last Supper, Mona Lisa - he develops a blind spot; he is even reluctant to use the word 'masterpiece', which he calls 'a subjective and ultimately unhelpful term'. His demystifying zeal is at its harshest when he reviews the scholarly debate about the identity of the half-smiling siren in Mona Lisa. He reviews various fantastical efforts to solve the mystery, then asks: 'Is there really any mystery to solve?' For him, there's no question that the subject is an obscure and comfortingly ordinary Florentine housewife.</p> <p>He goes on to quote the entranced prose-poem in which Walter Pater hinted at the Mona Lisa's vampirish sexual rapacity, but dismisses the rhapsody as 'blarney'. Nicholl prefers the homage paid to her by Nat King Cole, who crooned: 'Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep', and admits that he first heard of the painting thanks to a hit-parade song in which Jimmy Clanton praised his 'Venus in blue jeans, Mona Lisa with a ponytail'.</p> <p>Surrealists stuck a pipe in her smirking mouth or attached a moustache to her upper lip in order to desecrate her; Nicholl thinks that a ponytail might suit her and admires the 'wonderful bubblegum blandness' of Clanton's image. The goddess has been turned into a teen pinup.</p> <p>The assiduity and acuteness of Nicholl's research is compelling and his knowledge of Italy, where he lives, serves to locate Leonardo in a recognisable world of arriviste mansions, louche brothels and semi-industrial artistic workshops. Nevertheless, despite the book's almost forensic assault on his quirks and its exposure of his failings, I can't help feeling that Leonardo has flapped his wings and soared suddenly aloft, eluding the biographer who wants to tug him down to earth.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Lucrezia Borgia: Life, Love and Death in Renaissance Italy</strong><br>by Sarah Bradford<br>Viking \u00a325, pp421</p> <p>The most compelling thing about Lucrezia Borgia are the lurid rumours that eddied around her. They whispered that she committed incest with her father Alexander, and maybe her brother. Rumour maintained she had a hand in the poisonings which removed unwanted rivals. Sarah Bradford, returning to the Borgias after biographies of the Windsors and Kennedys, is keen to confer respectability on her Renaissance heroine.</p> <p>The Borgias moved through a fog of intrigue and bottom-line alliances. Princelings test poisons on cats and doves; brothers are blinded and assassinated; there's a particularly revolting scam involving olive oil and syphilis. In general, Bradford wrinkles her nose at this Renaissance unpleasantness and returns to inking in the family trees.</p> <p>Bradford has clearly never met a list she didn't like: she catalogues in-laws, menus, masques and wardrobes. Page after page is devoted to Borgia bling.</p> <p>Each of Lucrezia's marriages was made for strategy, and was plotted for maximum political and financial gain by her family. First betrothed at 10, she married husband number one at 13, in 1493. When a better prospect was in view, her husband was bullied into accepting a divorce on grounds of non-consummation.</p> <p>The second got on the wrong side of Alexander and Cesare, Lucrezia's brother, whose henchman had him suffocated.</p> <p>Husband number three was heir to the dukedom of Ferrara, a practical man, handy with a lathe, who built foundries in the gardens. His second marriage was not without passion. The new couple made love three times during their first night together. Neither partner was faithful: Lucrezia enjoyed a romance with a poet and a long relationship with her bisexual brother-in-law, Francesco: rugged, violent, fond of sex and horses.</p> <p>Lucrezia and her kin were close enough to corruption to become disenchanted, but she appears to have maintained a faith that grew as she got older. Even in her youth, she would retreat to the nearest convent and wait for awkward family conflicts to unknot themselves.</p> <p>How deep was her faith? Perhaps it operated as a sideways bet against damnation. Her third father-in-law collected nuns, preferably sisters who displayed stigmata, and his opposition to the marriage was mollified when Lucrezia helped him add to his collection.</p> <p>Despite all this potential colour, Lucrezia remains monochrome: a canny survivor, nobody's fool. It's hardly enough to justify this slab of biography. Sarah Bradford's study sticks to the personal: she isn't interested in economics or ideology. History, for her, is about people, which is why it is doubly disappointing that she's unable to make them live.</p>",
  "<p>A good rule of life is never, never, never meet writers you admire. I have admired Kitty Kelley from her first biography, Jackie Oh!, back in 1978 right through to the present day. </p> <p>She isn't the world's greatest stylist, but she has a wonderful eye for detail and an ear for the telling quote. (There is a good line in her new book, The Family, that one perk of being a Bush is that you get the Rev Billy Graham on speed dial.) She is a formidable researcher, who is prepared to chase every conceivable document and interviewee for months or even years if necessary. Most of all, though, I admire her courage. She tackles the subjects most journalists are scared of - living, powerful people who can mobilise armies of expensive lawyers. I wish we'd had a Kitty Kelley here when Robert Maxwell was alive. It makes me furious when journalists turn round and say, 'Oo, isn't Kitty Kelley nasty!', as if the well-known purpose of journalism was to spread sweetness and light. </p> <p>However, having said all that, I must say she's a disappointment to meet. Fluffy, kittenish, baby-faced, wearing an angora sweater with, I kid you not, an appliqu\u00e9-ed heart on the sleeve, she must have been a terrific sex bomb in her youth, but I find her cutie-pie manner fairly gruesome in a woman of 62. We meet for breakfast at Claridge's, where she is staying for the British leg of her publicity tour. She has been touring America for three weeks, and is off to Madrid and Paris later, so she has the zombified air of someone who doesn't quite know what city she is in. I keep administering coffee in the hope that she might wake up. She seems almost comatose; she talks ... so ... incredibly ... slowly. What she most reminds me of is those marathon dancers in They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, desperately keeping going, but only just. When she does talk, she often lets sentences trail into silence, but with many nods and smiles to suggest they mean more than they do. I feel very clunky interviewing her, trying to get her to actually say what she means.</p> <p>I ask if it was her idea to write about the Bush family, or her publisher's, and she says hers: 'I suddenly thought, \"Gosh, this is a powerful family that I never before paid any attention to.\"' She started work in December 2000, and only finished in July this year, when the publishers virtually snatched the typescript out of her hands, presumably wanting it in time for the presidential election. Consequently, the book has more about the Bush predecessors - grandfather Senator Prescott Bush, 41st President George HW Bush and his terrifying wife Barbara Bush, known to her sons as 'The Nutcracker' - than it does about the current president, who gets rather short shrift at the end. </p> <p>The most sensational allegation about George W Bush is that he snorted cocaine at Camp David when his father was president. Kelley's source for this claim was Sharon Bush, ex-wife of Dubya's brother Neil. However, the day before The Family was published in the States, Sharon Bush went on television to deny that she had said any such thing. Kitty Kelley came back with a statement through her publishers, Doubleday, that she had interviewed Sharon Bush over a four-hour lunch at the Chelsea Bistro, and had then read her notes back to Mrs Bush the next day in the presence of her Doubleday editor, and Mrs Bush had approved them. Moreover, Sharon Bush had taken a PR to the lunch, one Lou Colasuonno, who publicly backed Kelley's version. What shocked me about this spat was that it revealed that Kitty Kelley hadn't tape-recorded the lunch. </p> <p>I thought she taped all her interviews, but apparently not - 'It was in a restaurant, I never tape in them.' But surely it cannot be beyond her powers to find a tape recorder that works in restaurants? I find it amazing that her lawyers did not insist on tapes from the outset. However, Kelley is famous for never having been successfully sued and says the secret of avoiding lawsuits is, 'You have to hold something back. You almost have to hold back 10 per cent, so that when people come running at you, you can say, \"Well would you like to see all the evidence?\"'</p> <p>The Family actually contains so little scandal about George W Bush, I imagine there were celebrations up and down the West Wing when the first copies arrived. Kelley establishes that he drank too much as a young man (which he has never denied) and was apt to perform a dance called the Alligator at parties. She quotes one former classmate saying that, 'He couldn't even relate to women unless he was loaded,' and she hints that, when drinking, he might have been abusive to Laura. She establishes that he avoided the Vietnam draft by joining the Air Reserve, but that he then failed to complete all the hours he should have put in as a reservist. She suggests that he stopped attending the Reserve when they introduced random drug testing because, she implies, he would have failed a drug test. </p> <p>Frankly, so what? We knew about the drinking; we knew he was 'wild' in his youth. If his wildness also encompassed the odd snort of cocaine or toke of pot, well, that wouldn't be amazing in the Seventies. As for mistresses, they are conspicuous by their absence. Dubya is clearly no Bill Clinton - there are no thong-snapping interns falling out of his Oval Office closets. I told Kelley that I thought the book lacked a smoking gun. 'So what would I have had to come up with?' she snapped. 'Fornicating goats?' Well naturally they would have been welcome, but just a few affairs would suffice. 'Pity you couldn't have seen the cutting-room floor!' she says, with a lot of eye-rolling to imply that it is knee-deep in affairs. 'But would that really have done it for you?' 'Yes,' I say, 'adultery would prove that he could lie.'</p> <p>She immediately switches tack: 'It isn't so much the lying, as a life of not facing consequences. He hasn't had to lie. Most of us have to. He doesn't have to because there's always going to be someone there to pick up the pieces. The rules are different for the Bushes and I attribute it to the American class system, which is not supposed to exist, but which the Bushes prove very much exists.' Surely the same was true of the Kennedys? 'No. Joe Kennedy was a robber-baron but he made such a vast amount of money that he was able to endow his kids with financial security for the rest of their lives, so they never had to hustle like the Bushes. I didn't see that sense of self-entitlement as much with the Kennedys.'</p> <p>Maybe that's just because they're Catholics and she's Catholic? </p> <p>'Well it might seem like that,' she concedes, 'but I'm not as Catholic as you might think, or as the nuns who raised me might hope!' Then she goes on, in a strange dreamy voice: </p> <p>'I still love my nuns. I still take care of them. I acknowledge the Sisters of the Holy Names in my book with great thanks. They don't discuss my lapses, but they educated me, they were wonderful. No one takes care of old women, you know. Jesuits get these great endowments. When my father died, he endowed a library at Gonzaga University, which is a Jesuit college - and I'm glad Daddy did - but who's endowing stuff for the nuns, who's taking care of them? Nobody takes care of them.' Huh? For a minute, she looks as if she might cry, perhaps remembering her father, who died two years ago. It is very rare indeed for Kitty Kelley to talk about her family or indeed to reveal anything at all about her background. The little we do know comes from a 1991 unauthorised biography called Poison Pen by George Carpozi Jnr, which she has dismissed as rubbish, while also claiming not to have read it. I thought I could at least clear up some of the allegations in the book, but the minute I mention one - that she went through a period of addiction to diet pills - she turns all steely and staring and says, 'Has that been said? Where?'</p> <p>'In the Carpozi book.'</p> <p>'Oh really?' she says, mega-frosty, as if I'd just put a dead rat on the table. 'I don't know, I seriously didn't read it.' This was obviously meant to end the discussion, but I persist: 'So anyway, what's the answer?' Did she take diet pills? 'My answer is I certainly took them as a fat little girl, I was put on them by the doctor, but addicted, no. I'm addicted to coffee.' </p> <p>Anyway, the known facts of her life are as follows. She was born in Spokane, Washington State, in 1942. She was the eldest of eight children (seven girls, one boy) of an Irish Catholic family. Her father was a successful lawyer. She told me that her family was 'very Republican, not too dissimilar from the Bushes'. As rich as the Bushes? 'Yes. I was fortunate.' Kelley was popular at school and voted friendliest girl in her class four years in succession; she also won the 'Lilac Princess' beauty pageant. But, according to a childhood friend quoted by Carpozi, 'She had a very rough time. Her mother is the key. It's no secret that she was a long-time alcoholic ... She had the reputation of being vicious, so Kitty learnt from a master.' </p> <p>Kitty started at the University of Arizona but, according to Carpozi, was accused of stealing jewellery from a roommate and switched to the University of Washington in Seattle. She worked as a VIP hostess at the 1963 New York World's Fair, then moved to Washington DC to work for Senator Eugene McCarthy. Afterwards, she claimed to have been his press secretary; he said she was a receptionist. Then she got a job at The Washington Post, where she claims she was an investigative reporter; the Post says she was a secretary/ researcher. But her bosses grew suspicious that she was taking unnecessarily detailed notes whenever Katharine Graham (the owner of the Post) attended meetings, and she was dismissed. After this, she was a freelance, supplying items to the gossip columns and writing articles on 'How to lose weight and seduce a senator.' Again, there are dark rumours quoted by Carpozi that she got her material in unconventional ways - by stealing a manuscript in one case, and rooting through a wastepaper bin in another. </p> <p>Her first book, The Glamour Spas, about fat farms, was published in 1975. Her second book, Jackie Oh! about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, became a surprise bestseller because she revealed the extent of JFK's philandering for the first time. She then wrote her truly glorious book Elizabeth Taylor: Last Star, which is not too long, and hilarious throughout. By this stage she was married to an unsuccessful novelist called Mike Edgley, who claimed that she sent him out each night to raid Liz Taylor's dustbins. (She and Edgley divorced in 1989; for the past 12 years she has been very happily married to Jonathan Zucker, a physician, though she says she still signs her notes to him 'The current wife'.) </p> <p>The Last Star made Kelley a publishing hot property, able to command multimillion dollar advances, and her books on Frank Sinatra, Nancy Reagan and The Royals got successively weightier and, in my view, less fun. Her books have to be big, of course, to justify their enormous advances and to make them look 'serious', but the amount of scandal in them is steadily decreasing. In fact, I fully anticipate that Kelley will one day produce a 1,000-page book with just one scandalous sentence in it. She almost came a cropper over her last book - it was meant to be a biography of Prince Philip, but she obviously couldn't find enough dirt, so it became a general book about the royal family. It was never published here - she says for libel reasons - but it contained little that was new to anyone who reads the British tabloids. </p> <p>Writing about the royals probably taught her the great advantage of writing about a family rather than an individual - namely, that you can throw in every schizophrenic cousin, bankrupt uncle and alcoholic aunt, and blacken the whole family by association. This is what she has done with the Bushes and I think it's unfair - any family should be allowed to have its black sheep. 'You're quite right, but this is not any family,' she retorts. 'This is a family that maintains the highest office in the land - the most powerful family in the world. The rules are different for the Bushes, and they're different because the mainstream media have given the Bushes a free ride. Not so Clinton. In fact, a New York Times columnist won a Pulitzer prize for detailing the sexual dalliances of a president [Clinton]. I tell you about the sexual dalliances of a president [Bush senior, not Dubya] and get my head blown off!'</p> <p>She once said that researching her Nancy Reagan book was even more frightening than researching Frank Sinatra, but now she says that both of them were 'a piece of cake' compared to the Bushes - 'Frank Sinatra was tough, but that's just thug tough.' Does she mean she was in fear of her life? 'No, not frightened in that way. But the White House attacked this book before it was even available to be read. They called NBC and said, \"Keep her off the air.\" And suddenly TV producers who'd already booked me started cancelling. Larry King - I've done the Larry King show for every book I've ever written. But this time he wouldn't invite me.'</p> <p>I wonder if it was because she claims she seduced Larry King to have phone sex with her, taped it and played the tape to her friends. She laughs a surprisingly dirty laugh and says, 'Oh no, he's gotten over that! I've been on his show often since then. Anyway, he has phone sex with everybody,' she jokes. Really? I squeak. 'What - if I rang Larry King up, he'd have phone sex with me?' 'I think you'd have to go out to dinner with him first,' she smiles. </p> <p>When she laughs her real belly laugh you get a hint of someone who might be enormous fun to know. But she obviously feels she has to be 'dignified' in interviews and soon reverts to prissy prom-queen mode. 'This was the hardest book, not because I felt I'd get beat up, but come November I might be either facing a heavy IRS [income tax] audit or I'd be in the Federal Witness Protection Programme. The Bushes are powerful. The White House is making itself very felt on this book. And yet nobody has stepped forward to say, \"Let me challenge the fact on page 420.\" Nobody has said the facts are wrong. They just want to blacken the author, so that then the book is discredited. If you cared very much about the rich and the famous, the high and the mighty, there's no contest. If I cared about that, I too would go with the Bushes and not with Kitty Kelley.'</p> <p>But while she expects flak from the White House, she claims to be hurt and somewhat mystified by the way journalists treat her. They should hail her as a hero, not slag her off like a pariah. Of course it's true that American journalists always take themselves far more seriously than British ones, but the level of personal venom directed against her is striking - Slate magazine calls her 'colonoscopist to the stars'. She thinks the reason journalists attack her is because, 'They are on bended knee. I guess the coin of their realm is access. And were they to accept this book, even objectively, they'd then be admitting that, a: they didn't do their job for the last 50 years, and b: they've been conned.' </p> <p>But then she adds that when Frank Bruni recently interviewed her for The New York Times, two of his first questions were: 'Have you had an abortion?' and, 'Do you do cocaine?' She looks so hurt and aggrieved recalling this that I find myself mewing in sympathy - until I remember that these are just the sort of questions Kelley addresses in her books. But whereas Bruni asked the questions directly, she'd never ask them - she'd go round the houses collecting hearsay and building innuendo. </p> <p>This is my problem with Kitty Kelley. I don't object to her being a muckraker or scandal-seeker. Given that her subjects are always people who command vast PR machines, it is quite useful to have someone add a little spice to the prevailing sugar. But I do sometimes worry about her techniques. She relies a lot on innuendo. In the current book, she makes much of Laura Bush's 'dazed' expression and hints darkly that she might be on antidepressants. Is that a crime? No, Kelley retorts; if she were married to a Bush, she would be on antidepressants. But that isn't the point, because she hasn't established that Laura Bush is on antidepressants - it is just left dangling, as a vague slur to give the impression that Laura Bush is some kind of flake.</p> <p>Perhaps it was Kelley's failed stint on The Washington Post that gave her the desire to go where most journalists fear to tread, and to show up their failures. She says that one of the most telling scenes in The Family is her account of a press conference President Bush senior gave in August 1988 when The New York Post finally exposed his long-term affair with his aide, Jennifer Fitzgerald. All the journalists were saying beforehand that they would have to raise the subject - but none of them wanted to be the one to do it. In the end, it was a CNN reporter - a woman, of course - who stood up and asked the question, and President Bush responded furiously, 'I won't entertain that sleazy question!' The other journalists moved smoothly on to different subjects, and the CNN reporter was soon afterwards moved to another job. 'But her question was perfectly legitimate!' says Kelley.</p> <p>I think this is how Kelley sees herself - as the one brave journalist prepared to ask the awkward questions. But then why does she get so huffy when anyone asks her direct questions? Why was it so offensive of Frank Bruni to ask if she took cocaine, or me to ask if she was once addicted to diet pills? Why is she so shocked that someone wrote an unauthorised book about her? And why is she so secretive about her past? I ask if she would ever write her autobiography. 'Oh please!' she sniffs. 'It would be very boring. I like my life, don't get me wrong. But it's a worker-bee life.' And so saying, she whisks out of Claridge's into her limo for the journey to Heathrow and Madrid, and another hard day collecting publicity pollen.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Family by Kitty Kelley is published by Bantam Press at \u00a320.</p>"
