  "<p>Kostas Kederis finally arrived at the Olympic village with a little bit of fanfare yesterday but Greece's Olympic 200m champion has had a profile that has been almost subterranean. Since Sydney, four years ago, trying to track down the whereabouts of Kederis is seemingly beyond the ability of not only most journalists but also his own Greek team management. </p> <p>With the Games only hours away, officials were unsure whether Kederis had arrived in the capital or was still abroad training. The country's Olympic team manager, Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, had said on Monday that the 31-year-old was preparing in Chicago and would not return for the opening ceremony today.</p> <p>Team officials later said they had their dates mixed up. \"The dates referred to [Kederis's] entrance into the Olympic village, not his return to Greece,\" said a Greek team spokesman before he eventually did check into the village.</p> <p>There had been much speculation in the Greek media for several months that Kederis would play a major role in the opening ceremony, perhaps even being given the ultimate honour of lighting the Olympic flame. He was an obvious choice after recently being voted the most popular man in Greece with his image adorning dozens of billboards.</p> <p>Cathy Freeman, who lit the flame four years ago, wrote in her autobiography of the incredible lengths to which organisers in Sydney went to keep her role in the ceremony secret and if this had been a similar ruse to do the same thing with Kederis no one would be suspicious.</p> <p>But unfortunately Kederis's elusiveness was a reminder of the suspicions that followed his win in Sydney, his first in a major race. Perhaps there was a more sinister reason for his privacy than just wanting to concentrate on his training.</p> <p>He had been among Greece's best medal hopes but has hardly competed in the past 12 months since withdrawing from the world championships in Paris last year because of a leg injury. \"I feel wonderful,\" he said during a recent rare TV interview. \"I have recovered from all my injuries. There were some minor problems that prevented me from competing in Paris, but I would never risk the chance to compete in the Athens Olympic Games.\"</p> <p>Recently the Greek national coach, Odysseas Papatollis, explained there were a number of reasons for this pattern of non-competition, one of them being the Greek government was providing Kederis with funding - there are reports he receives $100,000 (\u00a355,000) per year - so he did not need to seek money elsewhere.</p> <p>But this is small change compared to the sum Kederis could have expected to earn had he raced regularly on the European grand prix circuit during the last four years, especially as after his Sydney victory he added the world and European titles in 2001 and 2002.</p> <p>Kederis maintains a low profile in the media. Calls to agents, coaches, the Hellenic athletics federation and old friends, requesting an interview, have been usually left unreturned. For an Olympic champion, there is remarkably little information available on the man. Type his name into an internet search engine and there are only 164 entries for him. As a comparison, there are more than 30,000 for Paula Radcliffe.</p> <p>Similarly, the official Olympic information system at these games is not able to shed much light on Kederis beyond the fact he enjoys reading, the cinema and working with children. He is an air force officer and is single.</p> <p>During a press conference after he had won the 100m at the Greek championships in June he appeared to hide behind his lack of English, leaving the British, American and Australian journalists as bereft of knowledge on him as when they started. But, according to the official Games info system, Kederis speaks English.</p> <p>It is a similar story with Katerina Thanou, Greece's other sprint hope, whose silver medal in the 100m in Sydney four years ago was as surprising as Kederis's gold. Both athletes had come from nowhere to stun the world. The common link between the pair is their coach Christos Tzekos.</p> <p>Kederis, originally from the island of Lesbos, was a mid-ranking 400m runner until Tzekos persuaded him to switch his attention to the 200m. Even then he failed to make much impact and in the 2000 European indoor championships finished last behind Britain's Christian Malcolm.</p> <p>Within six months, however, he was the Olympic champion, having run nearly a quarter of a second faster than he ever had before.</p> <p>The secret, Tzekos claimed, was a specially designed stretching and strengthening regime after he had identified Kederis had one leg shorter than the other.</p> <p>This would all have been slightly more believable if Tzekos's reputation was not so tarnished by allegations linking his own name to doping, something he has always denied.</p> <p>In 1997 the International Association of Athletics Federations disciplined him after he allegedly threatened a sampling officer while the Greek athletes, who did not include Kederis, escaped.</p> <p>Suspicions were also raised in 2002 when Kederis and Thanou were among a number of athletes who withdrew from a grand prix meeting in Athens after it was discovered a team of sampling officers from the IAAF had arrived in town. The most bizarre incident came last year, however, when Kederis and Thanou claimed to be training in Crete but had actually secretly relocated to Qatar - during the Gulf War. The IAAF officially warned the Greeks over the incident.</p> <p>It is not only in athletics that Tzekos's methods have been brought into doubt. Four years ago the AEK Athens midfielder Vassilis Lakis alleged that Tzekos had been feeding the players with cocktails of \"unknown substances\" while working for the club.</p> <p>These players included Theo Zagorakis, the former Leicester City player, who had once tested positive for testosterone but was subsequently cleared.</p> <p>The scandal has not prevented Zagorakis from becoming a modern-day Greek god after captaining his country to victory at Euro 2004. And until last night, when he failed to turn up for a dope test on the eve of the Olympics, the rest of the world's suspicions did not seem set to affect the popularity here of Kostas Kederis either.</p>",
  "<p>Google founders Larry Page and Serge Brin have become embroiled in yet more financial controversy just hours before the start of the company's long awaited \u00a320bn floatation.</p> <p>The Stanford university graduates, who founded the company six years ago, could come under investigation by US financial watchdogs after giving an interview to Playboy magazine which became public just as the company announced it would begin the auction of its shares.</p> <p>The interview, given during the so-called \"quiet period\", threatens to delay the float because US regulations restrict what executives can say while preparing a stock market float.</p> <p>In the seven-page interview the two founders talk about how great and popular the company's search engine is and how it even saved a users life.</p> <p>The interview was sent to some subscribers yesterday, just hours before this morning's announcement that the unusual Dutch-style auction of around 26 million shares would begin today.</p> <p>Would-be US investors who registered their interest in the auction can now bid for the shares, which the company hopes will be priced at between \u00a360-\u00a375 each.</p> <p>Staff at US financial watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission have examined the interview but have yet to decide if the information it contains could constitute a breach of its regulations.</p> <p>The interview was conducted on April 22 at Google's Californian headquarters, a week before it filed its registration for an initial public offering but while the two founders would have been discussing the float with banks, including its two lead underwriters Morgan Stanley and CSFB.</p> <p>In the interview Mr Page tries to distance the IPO from the heady boom-bust days of the internet goldrush.</p> <p>\"We have more than 150,000 advertisers and a lot of salespeople. Millions of people use Google. It's a completely different thing.\" </p> <p>The US regulator is particularly sensitive to promotional remarks, known in America as \"gun jumping\" and \"ramping the market.\"</p> <p>Four months ago the SEC forced Salesforce.com to delay its IPO for six weeks after chief executive Marc Benioff collaborated on an article published in the New York Times.</p> <p>Should Google face a similar fate, it will just be the latest in a long line of gaffes that have taken the company from hero to zero status with many would-be investors. </p> <p>Earlier this month, the flotation hit a \"logistical snag\" after the company was forced to admit to US financial regulators that it may have broken federal securities laws by failing to register \u00a316m in so-called \"buddy\" shares, issued to staff and existing shareholders prior to the float. </p> <p>Investment funds have been advising their clients to steer clear of the float, concerned that public appetite for the stock could over-inflate the initial share price in an echo of the dotcom boom of four years ago. </p> <p>But if it pans out as planned, Google's flotation will make billionaires of its founders and multimillionaires of the chief executive Eric Schmidt and board members John Doerr and Michael Moritz, who between them will retain over 55% of voting rights in the company.</p> <p>Google said today it hoped to announce the flotation price for its shares early next week.</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Interbrew, the Belgian group which this month is expected to become the world's largest brewer, yesterday took full control of Russia's second biggest beer group for \u20ac530m (\u00a3356m) in shares. </p> <p>By buying out its joint venture partner - family controlled SUN Group - Interbrew, maker of Stella Artois and Beck's, consolidates its position in the rapidly expanding Russian market behind market leader Baltika, which is owned by BBH, a joint venture between Carlsberg and Scottish &amp; Newcastle. </p> <p>In return the Khemka family, which started SUN Brewing in Russia in 1992, will receive a 3.4% stake in an enlarged Interbrew following its \u20ac9.2bn cash and shares acquisition of Brazilian brewer AmBev. InterbrewAmBev will control 14% of the world beer market. </p> <p>Nand Khemka, an Indian national who has run brewing operations in Russia for more than 40 years, will take a seat on the InterbrewAmBev supervisory board but will not be given voting powers. </p> <p>Russia, the second fastest growing beer market, behind China, has seen sales more than double in six years. Drinkers have been switching from vodka to beer as incomes rise and western consumer trends are adopted. </p> <p>Russian beer consumption averages 92 pints a year, only half as much as in Germany. But with sales volumes of 74m hectolitres last year - expected to rise to 80m this year - Russia could be overtaking Germany as Europe's largest market by 2006. </p> <p>Baltika, which dominated a thriving beer market in the absence of competition throughout the 90s, has recently struggled to maintain market share in the face of a host of rivals - particularly SUN after it joined forces with Interbrew in 1999. </p> <p>Other international brewers to have entered the Russian market include SABMiller and Turkish-controlled Efes Breweries International, which in May announced plans for a partial flotation in London. </p> <p>Heineken has also been operating in Russia for two years, and this week acquired a further two breweries, in Sterlitamak and Nizhny Novgorod, to become the country's third-biggest beer producer. </p> <p>Last month BBH revealed it had lost market share in Russia for three consecutive quar ters but it still accounts for 32% of the market. SUN Interbrew has grown from 12% at the start of 2003 to almost 16%. </p> <p>Much of SUN Interbrew's gains have been attributed to a move into cheap plastic packaging and cans in place of bottled beer. Their popularity with Russian drinkers forced competitors to follow suit. </p> <p>Interbrew will take control of 75% of SUN Interbrew's voting shares under the terms of the deal announced yesterday. That comes after Alfa Group, a Russian consortium, recently acquired more than 10% of voting shares in a move some observers saw as a potential challenge to Interbrew. </p> <p>Carlsberg, S&amp;N's partner in BBH, said yesterday a cool summer across much of Europe would hit its full-year sales figures, cancelling out gains made from promotional activity around Euro 2004. </p> <p>\"Bad weather in northern Europe continuing in July will adversely affect full-year operating profit. Therefore expectations on operating profit ... will not be revised upwards,\" the company said, adding that marketing costs would continue to be high for the rest of the year, particularly in Russia. </p> <p>The remarks came after Carlsberg posted operating profit up 23% for the first six months of 2004 to DKK1.5bn (\u00a3135m), on net revenue ahead by 4% at DKK16.9bn. </p> <p>Carlsberg chief executive Nils Smedegaard Andersen was last month quoted in the Danish press as saying he would defend BBH's market position \"at any cost\". </p> <p>Hitting back at allegations that BBH brands were poorly promoted, he said marketing budgets had been doubled to about 7% of turnover. \"It is more than the number two [SUN Interbrew] can ever dream of spending.\"</p>",
  "<p>In case anybody needed a reminder of the filthy lucre on offer in the world of hedge funds, up popped Jupiter Asset Management's annual report yesterday to reveal that Philip Gibbs took home \u00a38.2m last year. </p> <p>Good luck to him, many will say. A few years ago, he was a humble banking analyst at BZW, he took a risk with his career and is clearly good at his job. Jupiter, the company, may still be loss-making but the bits for which Mr Gibbs has responsibility, including the Hyde Park hedge fund, are showing excellent investment returns. </p> <p>Yet something jars about the size of these sums. A successful chief executive of a large FTSE 100 company, whose decisions directly affect the lives of tens of thousands of employees, does well to collect more than two or three million in a year. Betting on the success or failure of those decisions can clearly be far more rewarding. </p> <p>Naturally, every self-confident financial expert wants to try his hand. A fascinating piece of research by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein yesterday calculated that there were 6,000 hedge funds at the end of 2003, managing $850bn of funds. Ten years before the figures were 1,500 and about $200bn; Dresdner's analysts call it \"near exponential growth.\" </p> <p>Their concern is not individual managers' rewards, but the bubble-like nature of this new industry. Growth was fuelled by poor returns in traditional equities and cheap money as Fed chairman Alan Greenspan cut interest rates in the wake of the dotcom implosion. </p> <p>Cheap credit and a belief in the discovery of a new paradigm in investment sounds a flammable mix, as the dotcom bubble itself proved. The added problem with hedge funds is that everybody is chasing the same opportunities - everybody wants to be a momentum investor in the belief that easy returns of 15% a year are available. All modern investment experience says they are not there for all. DKW reckons it could end painfully. \"Because of the widespread leverage employed by the hedge funds, any reduction in their number could drastically affect market prices,\" it says. You have been warned. </p> <p><strong>Going Dutch</strong></p> <p>Neelie Kroes, the new EU competition commissioner, has at least one attribute in her favour: she is neither French nor German, nor British for that matter. Certainly, a French or German appointee would be sorely tempted, and pushed by Paris or Berlin, to pursue a policy of defending and promoting \"national champions\" rather than enforcing stricter rules on state aid. The Dutch liberal-conservative, who sits on the boards of Volvo and mm02 inter alia, has a reputation as a tough, energetic, perhaps impatient, politician who will have to refine - and rethink - the legacy left by Mario Monti. </p> <p>Signor Monti is still bitterly resented in the US for blocking the merger between GE and Honeywell and, more recently, imposing a record fine on Microsoft. He also incurred French and German wrath by blocking politically-inspired mergers and demanding repayment of state aid. But the outgoing commissioner also suffered some severe legal defeats, such as over Airtours and Tetra Laval, and has been forced to trim back on state aid rules. Witness the deal with France that led to yesterday's capital-raising by Alstom. </p> <p>Competition lawyers at Linklaters believe Ms Kroes will bring a lot of private sector understanding but face problems tackling reform of the law on dominant companies to give more power to national governments - and those state aid rules which companies and governments bend in an unholy and spurious alliance to promote employment. </p> <p><strong>Up Green's street</strong></p> <p>It sounds idyllic. An exclusive, five-star resort nestling in a Spanish valley, sheltered by the Murcian hills and fringed by the Mediterranean sea. Watersports, golf and tennis. A casino for millionaires struggling to find ways to throw away their money. La Manga is a byword for decadence and excess. The Chardonnay flows, the jewellery glints in the sunshine and the phrase \"bling, bling\" lingers in the twilight. </p> <p>P&amp;O wants \u00a3100m for the resort as a single job lot. Understandably, the company feels La Manga does not fit with its portfolio of ferries and container ports. </p> <p>The only drawback? Footballers. Residents must share their space with the likes of Paul Gascoigne, Rio Ferdinand and Stan Collymore who have all, at some point, mistaken La Manga's fixtures and fittings for footballs. </p> <p>Tanya Turner from \"Footballers' Wives\" would lurve La Manga. She could showcase her fake bake, indulge in a little Celine Dion on the iPod by the pool and romance would be in the air. </p> <p>So who could nurture La Manga in a way which P&amp;O cannot? The place is too tacky for Sir Richard Branson, too upmarket for Stelios Haji-Ioannou and too expensive for struggling leisure companies such as MyTravel. </p> <p>The buyer should have an eye for a vanity purchase, an appreciation for the high life and a wallet bulging with cash. </p> <p>Step forward Philip Green, the orange-skinned buccaneering billionaire of the high street. If he hasn't been to La Manga, the order of the universe is flawed. La Manga would be the perfect place to plot a fresh assault on M&amp;S. Come on, Phil, wave your wad.</p>",
  "Twenty-eight leaders of the legal profession around the world have together condemned the US for the continued detention of hundreds of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. <p>In an open letter, the heads of bar and solicitors' organisations call on the Bush administration to scrap its \"review panels\" considering whether to release the men. </p> <p>They urge it to instead allow prisoners to challenge their detention in US courts, following the supreme court's ruling that civilian courts have jurisdiction over the US military base in Cuba. </p> <p>Lawyers for at least two of the four British detainees have already filed petitions demanding that the US government justifies their continued detention. </p> <p>Today's letter is signed by lawyers' leaders from Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, the Caribbean and several European states. They include Stephen Irwin QC, chairman of the Bar Council of England and Wales, and Edward Nally, president of the Law Society. </p> <p>They state that the case for civilian hearings is stronger than ever \"in view of the considerable time these detainees have been held, without access to lawyers of their choice or their families, and reportedly in conditions of physical and psychological duress\". </p> <p>They add: \"The war on terrorism will not and cannot be won by denying those suspected of terrorism the fundamental right of a fair opportunity to test the evidence against them.\" </p> <p>Many of the men have been held for almost two and a half years without charge. Last week three British former detainees described making false confessions after experiencing sustained abuse. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Law Society said: \"These leaders come together on occasion, but as far as I know this is the first time we have got so many signatures on one issue.\" </p> <p>He said many in the US legal system shared their concern, but \"we are keen to urge the government to take action\".</p>",
  "Indonesia's reluctance to punish senior military officers for alleged human rights abuses was reinforced yesterday with the acquittal of the special forces commander for crimes against humanity when troops under his command killed at least 23 demonstrators in 1984. <p>Justifying their verdict, the five judges declared the clash between the soldiers under Major General [then Captain] Sriyanto Muntrasan and thousands of protesters near Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta as \"spontaneous\" and not a \"widespread and systematic\" attack. They also accepted that the troops had fired warning shots and Gen Sriyanto had tried to halt the shooting. </p> <p>The judgment came two days after a retired military police general was cleared of not preventing the torture of 170 civilian detainees following the same incident on the grounds that the beatings they received were \"ordinary\" abuses and outside the tribunal's jurisdiction. </p> <p>Last week four officers convicted of involvement in the violence in East Timor in 1999, in which about 1,500 civilians were killed, were freed on appeal. </p> <p>This means Indonesia's courts have not upheld the convictions of any members of the security forces in relation to the months of violence in the territory which, according to UN staff, was orchestrated in Jakarta. </p> <p>Yesterday's verdict also contradicts the one recent conviction of a senior officer. In April Gen Sriyanto's immediate superior during the Tanjung Priok incident, Major General (rtd) Rudolf Buta Butar, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for failing to prevent the \"systematic killing of civilians\" during the protest. </p> <p>He is free pending an appeal and his lawyers are confident the conviction will be overturned. </p> <p>The demonstration by thousands of people from one of Jakarta's poorer districts was organised to demand the release of four people who had been detained on allegedly spurious grounds. </p> <p>The head of Gen Sriyanto's legal team, Colonel Burhan Dahlan, said the protesters' leaders should have been on trial. \"They were the organised ones, not the military,\" he said. \"The soldiers were just defending themselves.\" </p> <p>Controversy has dogged the tribunal from its outset. One witness said Tommy Suharto, a son of the then dictator, General Suharto, paid off some victims to stop them pursuing the case and two other prosecution witnesses inexplicably retracted their damning testimony shortly after they gave it. </p> <p>Hundreds of uniformed special forces troops packed the court when Gen Sriyanto was on trial. </p> <p>One woman at the hearing yesterday who did not want to be named, said her father was one of the dozens still missing from the incident. </p> <p>She was disappointed by the verdict. \"If he's not to blame, then I don't know who is,\" she said. \"You can't just point the finger at the junior soldiers who fired the bullets.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hayden Desser, the mysterious Canadian, has been ploughing his own idiosyncratic furrow for almost a decade. It isn't easy to describe what he does, but it is has caught the attention of the likes of Steve Buscemi and Neil Young. It's Young who sometimes springs to mind as Hayden's fourth album meanders pensively through its 15 tracks (16 counting the hidden one). Home By Saturday has the weary, rustic thump of Harvest-era Neil, while the bleary, earthy Starting Over has a bit of Young-style electric guitar in the background. On the other hand, Young doesn't use trumpets and flugelhorns, as Hayden occasionally does, though he does make sure you can hear his words.</p> <p>Hayden prefers to sing in a blurry mumble, letting his meanings emerge in the scuffed and yearning tone of his voice as much as in the words themselves. Chances are it'll grow on ya.</p>",
  "<p>Solo albums often come about because of a band member's deluded conviction that they have creative impulses that are being stifled. Ash guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, though, can confidently make a case for her offering, which delves further into fluttery pop than the power-rocking Ash would deem acceptable. The opener, Kim Wilde, is pretty near perfect - a breathless homage to her pouty childhood idol (who is \"everything I want, everything I need\").</p> <p>In fact, Hatherley has a general affinity with early 1980s new wave. These 10 tracks are linked by bursts of frothy, busy guitar, simple tunefulness and frail-but-valiant vocals, which recall long-forgotten heroines such as the Mo-Dettes and the Belle Stars. There's also a nice line in acid lyrics: check out Bastardo's ladylike diatribe against an improbably named local stud, Antonio.</p>",
  "For a loyal company man, Porter Goss appeared to be going out of his way to offend his former and potentially future employers at the CIA, saying that the agency was so badly managed it risked becoming \"a stilted bureaucracy incapable of even the slightest bit of success\". <p>Intelligence insiders say the attack on the directorate of operations where Mr Goss once worked was the result of careful calculation, and was intended to demonstrate the commitment of the Republican congressman to reforming the agency. </p> <p>It was delivered seven weeks ago - when there was already intense speculation that Mr Goss would be nominated to head the CIA - in a report from the house intelligence committee, which he headed until Tuesday. In the broadside, Mr Goss accused the CIA of ignoring its core mission activities, adding that the agency was so badly run it was heading \"over a proverbial cliff\". </p> <p>If his appointment as CIA director is confirmed by the Senate, Mr Goss will inherit that monument to mismanagement. What is less clear, however, is not only how far he will go in restructuring the CIA, but how long his job will exist. </p> <p>Intelligence reform proposals popular among Democrats include the appointment of a national intelligence tsar, who would outrank the CIA chief and control the budgets of 15 information-gathering services. That proposal is likely to become a key element of Mr Goss's confirmation hearings, which are expected to begin in early September. While the Democrats do not want to be seen as obstructing a key appointment in the war on terror, the proceedings are likely to become a platform from which to attack the Bush administration on intelligence. </p> <p>While Mr Goss certainly has the pedigree to be CIA chief, he presents a potentially rich target. Now 65, he is the product of a patrician Connecticut upbringing, graduating from an elite preparatory school and Yale University. He spent two years in the army in military intelligence before joining the CIA in 1962. It was the height of the cold war, and Mr Goss, who speaks Spanish, worked as a clandestine case officer based in the Miami office. </p> <p>At a time when the CIA was obsessive about the idea of communist infiltration of the trade unions - and undertook to sabotage or destroy so-called front organisations - his beat was the labour movements of central America and, later, Europe. Mr Goss has spoken little about his 10 years in the agency, beyond an aside that he was in the region during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. \"I had some very interesting moments in the Florida Straits,\" he told reporters recently. </p> <p>In the early 1970s, he contracted a bacteriological infection that almost killed him. The CIA ordered him into a desk job. It was not what he wanted, and Mr Goss left the agency. </p> <p>While he was in hospital, doctors had advised him to recuperate in a warm climate, and he chose Sanibel island, in south-west Florida, in part because a fellow CIA case officer had retired there. Mr Goss moved to the island in 1971, installing his wife, four children, a great dane, a cat and two turtles in a small rented three-bedroom house. \"He was kind of puny looking,\" said Grace Whitehead, the widow of Mr Goss's CIA colleague. \"He blossomed here.\" </p> <p>The Florida ventures started small: a boat letting agency with funds kept in two shoeboxes on the kitchen table of the Whitehead home. They did not stay small. The late Mr Whitehead founded a newspaper, largely as a vehicle from which to campaign for Sanibel to be incorporated as a municipality, and Mr Goss was chief reporter. When Sanibel - with its population of 1,200 - was incorporated, Mr Goss became mayor. </p> <p>He used the office to protect Sanibel from the developers who have reduced much of the Florida coast to hideous concrete high-rises. About two-thirds of the island has been designated as a conservation zone; the rest is an enclave of extremely expensive homes. </p> <p>He was gradually drawn into state politics and ran for Congress in 1988. His area is so heavily Republican that Mr Goss was re-elected unopposed in four subsequent elections. </p> <p>Although he is on the right on several of America's defining issues - he opposes abortion except in the case of rape, opposes gay marriage and supports the death penalty - in his early years in Congress he had a good reputation with local environmentalists in Florida. He sought a ban on oil drilling off the Florida coast, and supported speedboat bans to protect manatee. However, Laura Combs, from Save the Manatee, said he later did a U-turn on wildlife protection. </p> <p>He became chairman of the House of Representatives intelligence committee in 1997. That, and his years in the CIA, are his main credentials for the job. </p> <p>\"Frankly, I can't think of anybody who is that close to the agency without being in it at this time,\" said Peter Earnest, a 36-year veteran of the CIA, who is now director of Washington's Spy museum. </p> <p>But critics say Mr Goss can claim relatively few accomplishments for a lifetime devoted to intelligence issues. </p> <p>\"He has been head of the intelligence oversight committee for eight years. Can you point to one substantive thing that he has done in his position as chair?\" said a former counter-terrorism official. \"Instead of being a visionary, an activist, someone who would take the lead in getting the agency to reform, instead of addressing repeated intelligence failures that have occurred, Porter Goss was missing in action. He was just playing the status quo.\" </p> <p>During the years when Mr Goss's committee was entrusted with oversight of America's intelligence community, the CIA failed to predict in 1998 that India would conduct a nuclear test, or that al-Qaida would bomb US embassies in east Africa, US warplanes mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and a small al-Qaida motorboat blew a hole in the US navy destroyer USS Cole. Then came the attack by hijacked aircraft on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon in September 2001. </p> <p>The final report of the commission investigating the September 11 terrorist attacks also challenged Mr Goss's record, saying that he had given little attention to al-Qaida or terrorism before the attacks. Between January 1998 and the attacks, Mr Goss's committee held just two hearings on terrorism. The Senate committee on intelligence held eight hearings; the armed services committee held nine. </p> <p>But until relatively recently Mr Goss had the respect of his Democratic colleagues for a pragmatic, bipartisan style. That balance was gradually eroded over the last year, congressional staff say, as he cemented an alliance with the vice-president, Dick Cheney, and became more forthright about his Republican loyalties. Democrats accuse him of being too concerned with sparing the administration embarrassment. </p> <p>He blocked house investigations into the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal and Washington's links with its erstwhile Iraqi ally Ahmad Chalabi. </p> <p>The final straw for Democrats arrived the same week as Mr Goss delivered his diatribe against the CIA. During a debate in the house on security, he held up a sign with a 27-year-old quote from the Democratic challenger, John Kerry, calling for budget cuts to the intelligence services. Mr Goss later expressed regret, but by this week, when his nomination was announced, Democrats said he was too partisan to be CIA director. </p> <p>Mr Goss could fall down on another point: his willingness to make reform. He is not a subscriber to the view of the 9/11 commission that the White House should appoint a national intelligence chief who would assert overall financial and managerial control of America's 15 intelligence services. </p> <p>Instead, he has fixed his sights firmly on the CIA.

Frank MacGaffin, a former deputy director, believes the insider knowledge that remains Mr Goss's strongest suit will drive him to change the way the agency operates. \"He knows where things went wrong, and he must also have the same guilty knowledge that I and others have of the imperative of fixing it before there is another attack,\" Mr MacGaffin said. \"That guilty knowledge tells you that if you don't change some very essential things, it is going to happen again.\"</p> <p><b>Life in short</b></p> <p><b>Born</b><br>Waterbury, New Haven County, Connecticut, November 26 1938 </p> <p><b>Education</b><br>BA Yale University, 1960 </p> <p><b>Family</b><br>Wife, Mariel Robinson; four children; 11 grandchildren </p> <p><b>Wealth</b><br>Reported assets worth between $6m (\u00a33.3m) and $24m last year </p> <p><b>Career</b><br>US army 1960-62; CIA, 1962-72; member of city council and mayor, Sanibel, Florida, 1974-82; chair, Lee County, Florida, Commission 1985-86; Republican congressman, US House of Representatives, 1988 to present </p> <p><b>Bush on Goss</b><br>'Over 15 years of service, Porter Goss has built a reputation as a reformer.

  "Leon Golub, one of the major American artists of the postwar period, has died in New York, aged 82. His wife, the artist Nancy Spero, and their sons say that he left the world as he had always inhabited it - looking clearly and resolutely at the reality of things. <p>Following the generation of New York-based artists identified by their abstract and expressionist paintings, Golub, who was born in Chicago and studied at the School of the Art Institute under the GI Bill in 1947, was very much part of an alternative style of figuration based upon the expressive possibilities of the human body. </p> <p>Aware of European modernism from his earlier art historical studies and works in Chicago's Museum of Modern Art, in his early paintings he combined references to late classical sculpture with hybrid and mythical themes, particularly the image of the sphinx. They culminated in the mid-1960s in a series of wall-sized and heavily textured depictions of battling figures, the \"Gigantomachies\". </p> <p>The theme of embodiment was central to these works and remained a major preoccupation throughout his life: that is to say, how a pictorial art could picture the body as a sign of both social and psychological states of being, and of the disruptive and corrosive effects of power upon our individual and collective lives. </p> <p>The family had two periods of living and working abroad - nine months in Italy in the mid-1950s, made possible by the generosity of his first serious collector, and then five years in Paris from 1959. As figurative artists, both Golub and Spero, whom he had met at the Art Institute and married in 1951, felt marginalised by the critical and curatorial investment in the varieties of American abstraction, and Paris offered both the proximity of European art and a tradition of history painting in the works of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Jacques-Louis David and Gustave Courbet. </p> <p>The couple rented a maison particuli\u00e8re in the 16th arrondissement with an amenable Russian landlord who allowed Golub to install a ventilation pipe to extract some of the noxious fumes from the lacquer paints and solvents that were his basic working materials. Perhaps fortunately for the health of the whole family, the company manufacturing the product discontinued the line, and he began experimenting with acrylics, embedding the colour in the weft and warp of the canvas through a laborious process involving dissolving and scraping back the image with a meat cleaver to create the distressed look characteristic of his painted surfaces until the early 1990s. </p> <p>On their return to New York in 1964, the family encountered the first protests against the escalation of the Vietnam war. Passionately political, Golub had been active throughout his student period, and both artists joined the Artists and Writers Protest Group. While their studio became a centre for the organisation of anti-war activities, the immediacy of the conflict provided material evidence of the disintegrative effect of actual power upon real bodies, leading Golub to reflect upon his pictorial concerns. He moved away from the generalised conflictual arenas of the \"Gigantomachies\" to the depiction of charred and mutilated torsos, the Napalm series, followed by the three great Vietnam paintings of the 1970s, the largest of which, Vietnam II, has recently been donated to Tate Modern. </p> <p>Golub's paintings of the 1960s and 70s are also studies in the crisis of a masculine identity that a morally unjustifiable war had provoked. He now experienced a personal crisis in subject matter, destroying almost everything produced between 1974 and 1976 until a chance resemblance between a GI in Vietnam III and a news photograph of the young Gerald Ford suggested a fresh theme. </p> <p>Rethinking the genre of portraiture, he completed more than 100 portraits during the late 1970s, each image derived from a media representation of a public figure, from corporate and religious leaders to military dictators. </p> <p>These scraped and bare surfaces strip their subject of affectivity and depth as they appear to perform their role for the camera's eye, an uncertainty that, for the critic Donald Kuspit, was partly a response to feminism. Certainly, as Spero's own work reflected her involvement in the women's movement, Golub incorporated the ambiguities of gender roles into his paintings. He often joked about their respective practices: \"Nancy has the women and I go after the guys.\" </p> <p>Working on the portraits and the details in facial expression provided him with elements that became central to his best known works - the huge depictions of torture, interrogation and social violence painted during the 1980s. This marked a turning point in his career, and a public and critical recognition that had been absent since his early prominence in the 1950s. </p> <p>In 1982 he had his first solo exhibition in New York for 20 years, and he also exhibited the Mercenaries and Interrogations at London's Institute for Contemporary Arts. Charles Saatchi began collecting his work, and he was seen as an elder authority in the turn to figuration being taken by young artists across Europe and America. </p> <p>But Golub was only doing what he had always done - speaking back to power and documenting its politics and repressions. In this, he discovered a means to adapt the tradition of history painting to incorporate the technologies and techniques of the news media and cinema. </p> <p>What is particular about his compositions is the interaction between the figures and across pictorial space, the exchange of looks and gestures between victim and aggressor, or interrogator and mercenary, or the discomfort that we, the viewers, experience as they gaze out at us, inviting our complicity as war goes underground. </p> <p>The 1990s saw another remarkable shift in his work. At the age of 70, the biblical three score years and ten, Golub began a series of dystopian paintings suffused with darkness, an apocryphal world of scavenging dogs, strutting skeletons, roaring lions and proclamatory texts. Reminiscent of Vanitas paintings, where disorder and death shadow material wealth and earthly pleasures, these late paintings reflect Theodor Adorno's description of Beethoven: \"In the history of art, late works are the catastrophe.\" </p> <p>Leon drew my attention to this essay by Adorno many years ago, and I am convinced that this series partly records his own struggle with an ending, as his dogs and lions howl and roar against the dying of the light, against separation, loss and the end of all things. However, there was never anything melancholic in any of this. </p> <p>If an ending had to be made, it would come with an ironic humour at the service of an inquiring consciousness gazing fearlessly at the world. So, in one painting an upended skeleton in danger of losing its military trousers drops towards a pack of dogs with the inscription \"Another joker out of business\", while in another a figure crouching beneath an obviously hungry lion clutches a placard reading \"Why me?\". </p> <p>Here, perhaps, something of the substance of the man infuses the bare facts of a profoundly creative life: his vitality and strength in adversity, his humour and generosity, his fierce intelligence and political acuity. Leon loved to communicate, and he was a great orator, whether with a few friends in the studio apartment he shared with Nancy, in his capacity as a teacher for many years in the art department of Rutgers University, or at one of the numerous talks, lectures and panel discussions he led or attended over the years. His aphorisms were legendary and many of his longer texts were recently gathered together and published with the appropriate title Do Paintings Bite?. </p> <p>Indeed, like a dog with a bone, he chewed and gnawed at his subjects, refusing to let go until he had worried out some truth from an uncertain and troubled world which could find expression in one of his compositions. But, however much disenchantment ruled his imaginary scenarios, something is always given back, and we are the better for it. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife and their three sons, Stephen, Philip and Paul. </p> <p><b>Adrian Searle writes:</b> Gnomic, bald, funny and wise, Leon Golub was an indefatigable presence in the New York art world. In interviews, he and his wife were a wonderful double act, a reminder of an America with a conscience. His was a fierce and wry vision of the world. It was also - in the best sense - a terrible vision. His paintings told as much. There was something primordial about Golub's art. It has Etruscan painting in it, Lucas Cranach, Francisco de Goya, newspaper and TV newsreel images, details drawn from pornography and gun magazines. There was also tenderness in his paintings. An early sphinx, painted in Italy in the 1950s, still has fallen leaves from a Roman winter stuck in the enamel paint. He went on to paint images from a world which was both nearer and further from home: peasants and soldiers in Vietnam, mercenaries in El Salvador and Nicaragua, Americans in grubby suits stuffing a body into the trunk of a car. He painted street corners from whence no one might return. </p> <p>He painted both the torturers and the tortured. Golub once told me he saw little difference between the oppressors and the oppressed: they were all, equally, victims. He painted how coercion worked. Certain images might now remind us of the trophy photographs which have come out of Abu Ghraib jail. Golub knew that some things never change, that suffering is perpetual. But for those who ordered \"the wet work\", the generals and dictators, the politicians and their financiers, he reserved a special place, in a lengthy series of coruscating portraits. His paintings seemed to skin these guys alive, but had a tactile quality of awful, sinewy delicacy. </p> <p>In the late 1980s, Golub once sold a group of his death squad paintings to Charles Saatchi. When I interviewed the artist at the ICA, he said he hoped the paintings might get under the collector's skin, or at least \"fuck him up\". Saatchi went on to dispose of these paintings, which are among Golub's finest. The group of works he showed at Documenta in Germany, in 2002, were wild paintings of old age, and came as a shock to younger generations of artists unfamiliar with his work. </p> <p>At home, he and Nancy spent the days after 9/11 besieged by phone calls from around the world. Leon was greatly loved, even as he railed at the world's injustice, his bad back and feet, the bastards who run the country. Whenever I visited, the food came on paper plates from the deli downstairs (it saved time); tours of the studios were obligatory, as was scurrilous gossip, libellous conversation, a modicum of shouting. The best part of him never grew old. Leon was an unforgettable man, a great mentor, a big-hearted painter of unforgiving images, whose worth has yet to be fully acknowledged. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Leon Golub, artist, born January 21 1922; died August 8 2004</p>",
  "A Texas murderer who has taken his fight for clemency to the internet, where he sells handmade greeting cards and other artworks, is asking the state parole board to give him life in jail instead of the execution due on August 26. <p>James Vernon Allridge was condemned for shooting a shop assistant in Fort Worth, Texas, during two days in 1985 when he and three others were said to have carried out at least 20 robberies. One of the three was his brother Ronald, executed in 1995 for another murder. </p> <p>Relatives and others say in support of his appeal that he has been a model prisoner and poses no threat to anyone. </p> <p>His brother Darren said: \"In spite of what he's done, he cherishes and lives his life to the fullest that he can.\" </p> <p>The petition, which claims that he has been rehabilitated, includes statements by former prison officers and jurors, and examples of his art. </p> <p>If the board grants his appeal he will be eligible for parole almost immediately, but Jim Marcus, a Texas defence service lawyer helping with his appeal, said he was not likely to be freed. </p> <p>Victims' rights advocates such as Dianne Clements have criticised the greeting card sales (at <a href=\"http://www.ccadp.org/jamesallridge.htm\">ccadp.org/jamesallridge.htm</a>), which are helping fund his appeals, as \"murderabilia\". </p> <p>\"You're sentenced to death for the crime you committed, not your metamorphosis in a controlled environment,\" she said. </p> <p>\"What is rehabilitation anyway? This guy draws pictures and sells them for money. That doesn't negate the murder.\" </p> <p>Lisa Fine, one of Allridge's lawyers, said: \"This was a senseless murder. We are not asking that he be absolved of his guilt, only that he be allowed to spend the rest of his life in prison for what he's done.\" </p> <p>Allridge was visited recently by Susan Sarandon, who won an Academy award for her portrayal of the crusader against capital punishment Sister Helen Prejean in Dead Man Walking and is herself an outspoken opponent of capital punishment. </p> <p>One of jurors who convicted him, Laury Robertson, said she supported his efforts and regretted that he had been sentenced to death.</p>",
  "The California supreme court yesterday declared the marriages of thousands of same-sex couples in San Francisco void, after ruling that the city's mayor exceeded his authority by granting them marriage licences. <p>The ruling was the latest setback to efforts by the gay community to challenge laws that restrict the institution of marriage to heterosexual couples. </p> <p>The court said the mayor, Gavin Newsom, and city officials violated the law when they issued the certificates, since legislation and a state voter-approved measure defined marriage as a union between a man and woman. </p> <p>The judges decided by a 5-2 vote to nullify the 3,995 gay marriages performed in the city between February 12 and March 11, when the court halted the weddings. Their legality, Justice Joyce Kennard wrote, must wait until courts resolve the constitutionality of state laws that restrict marriages to opposite-sex couples. </p> <p>The court ordered officials in San Francisco to \"undo\" their previous \"unauthorised\" actions, correct official records and notify the newlyweds that their marriages were void. </p> <p>The ruling disappointed gay rights advocates who had hoped the weddings would remain valid while the broader arguments of the constitutionality of excluding same-sex couples from the institution of marriage were thrashed out. Gay couples faced the reversal with a mixture of defiance and dismay. </p> <p>\"No court can take away the love we share,\" said John Lewis, who married his partner, Stuart Gaffney, in the city six months ago. </p> <p>Phyllis Lyon, 79, who mar ried Del Martin, 83, said: \"After being together for more than 50 years, it is a terrible blow to have the rights and protections of marriage taken from us. At our age, we do not have the luxury of time.\" </p> <p>The issue of gay marriage has become a thorny one in the US after two key legal rulings last year. The first, by the US supreme court, struck down sodomy laws, effectively removing the last legal obstacle to gay relationships. </p> <p>The second, in Massachusetts, made gay marriage legal in that state alone, prompting President George Bush and other Republicans to call for an amendment to the US constitution that would limit mar riage to heterosexuals. Many states have already amended their statutes to do that. </p> <p>While neither of the Democratic party's White House challengers, John Kerry and John Edwards, supports gay marriage, both are opposed to a constitutional amendment. The right of same-sex couples to have their relationships legally recognised is expected to become a central social issue of the presidential campaign. </p> <p>The ruling \"is important, but it will not resolve whether same-sex couples have the right to marry and be treated equally under our state constitution\", Jennifer Pizer, a lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defence and Education Fund, a gay rights legal aid group, told the Associated Press. </p> <p>The issue of whether the mayor exceeded his authority had already been conceded by most gay activists. Kate Kendell, the director of the National Centre for Lesbian Rights, said it was clear Mr Newsom would be overruled. </p> <p>\"We think that's unfortunate and wrong, but the more human question is what to do with marriage licences that belong to couples in relationships and with families.\"</p>",
  "Gordon Smith, who has died after a battle with Alzheimer's disease, aged 80, was one of the finest Scottish rightwingers, yet his international career was a series of stops and starts, at its best in his veteran years. This was a period in which, first discarded by his principal club Hibernian, then by Hearts - their rivals, whom he had supported as a boy - he reached a dazzling maturity. <p>Born in Edinburgh, but brought up in Montrose, it was Hibs he joined rather than Hearts. He was a teenage prodigy, scoring 20 league goals in the League tournament of the 1941-42 season. The word was that, with his elegant control, pace and precise crossing, he was going to become \"the Scottish Stanley Matthews\", at a time when Matthews was destroying one Scotland leftback after another. Yet where Matthews had the big-match temperament, Smith proved not to have it at all. Always a shy person, the international occasion seemed, from his debut at 18 against England, to freeze him and nullify his talents. Altogether, his way often barred by the more straightforward Willie Waddell of Rangers, he won just 18 full caps over a 10-year period. </p> <p>After the first half dozen in the two immediate postwar seasons, he did not play for his country again till 1951-52. This despite the fact that in the 1949-50 season, he scored 25 goals in 29 games. </p> <p>He was an outstanding member of the \"famous five\" Hibs forward line, with Bobby Johnstone (obituary, September 6 2001), Lawrie Reilly, Eddie Turnbull and Willie Ormond, all internationals. He played 247 Scottish League games for Hibs, scoring 170 goals, helping them to win the title three times. He figured in the Scottish Cup Final of 1947, when he was hampered by an injured leg early in the game, and in the 1951 League Cup Final. </p> <p>Having won the Scottish Championship in 1954-55, Smith playing 28 games for nine goals, Hibs qualified for the first European Cup, from which Chelsea, under pressure from the insular Football League, cravenly withdrew. Smith was still in ebullient form in a team that thrashed Rot Weiss Essen 4-0 in Germany in the first leg of the opening round, drawing at Easter Road, 1-1. Djurgarden of Sweden were defeated, 3-1 at home, 1-0 away in the quarter-finals, but a brilliant Reims team, inspired by Raymond Kops, eliminated Hibs in the semi finals, 2-0 in France, 1-0 in Edinburgh. </p> <p>In the intervening summer, Smith at last regained his place in the Scotland team. Perhaps it was because he felt less pressure playing far from Scotland, but he had three exceptional games on tour: a 2-2 draw against Yugoslavia, a handsome 4-1 win against a bruising Austrian team, and finally a 3-1 loss to Hungary in which, however, Smith had an impressive game. His international record that season was three goals in four games. Half a dozen more appearances, though just a single goal, were to come in the next two seasons. </p> <p>In 1959, after a season in which a recurring ankle injury limited Smith to 15 League games and one goal, Hibs rashly and ungenerously gave him a free transfer, when they might have been better off paying for the ankle operation which he paid for himself. So they had to watch him flourish with their City rivals, Hearts, after getting fit on the Riviera. He and Hearts had immediate success, winning Championship and League Cup alike. He scored 10 goals in 29 League games, but in the European Cup, Hearts lost to Benfica, the eventual winners, in both legs. </p> <p>In 1961, it was Hearts who now let him go to flourish elsewhere, skill and intelligence making up for lost speed. Again Dundee, his new club, promptly won the championship, Smith getting seven goals in 32 games. There followed a glorious run in the European Cup, beginning with an 8-1 win over Cologne, though the return was lost 4-0 in Germany. Sporting beat them 1-0 in Lisbon, but Dundee won 4-1 in Edinburgh. However, a 5-1 defeat by Milan, ultimate Cup winners, at San Siro was too much to retrieve, though Dundee won the return 1-0. </p> <p>Smith retired to live in North Berwick in 1964. For a while in the late 70s he ran a pub near the Hibs ground called, appropriately, the Right Wing. </p> <p>His wife Joan predeceased him: he is survived by a son.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Gordon Smith, footballer, born May 25 1924; died August 7 2004</p>",
  "Janet Chisholm, one of the most unlikely spies in the history of espionage, has died aged 75, without ever talking about her role in a major British cold war coup. In Moscow, as an officer in the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), she ran Oleg Penkovsky, a colonel in Soviet military intelligence (GRU), who passed Soviet secrets to the west at the time of the 1962 Cuban missile crises. <p>Penkovsky had been trying to offer his services to the west for some years, blatantly buttonholing diplomats and businessmen at receptions and approaching tourists in the street. The CIA considered that he was a Soviet agent provocateur and warned its officers to have nothing to do with him. But the British decided to give him a trial. The problem was how to collect his material in Moscow without alerting the KGB's counter-espionage department. </p> <p>With London's approval, Janet Chisholm, the wife of the embassy's \"visa officer\", Ruari Chisholm, was assigned the job. She would take her young children for a walk in a park. Penkovsky would wander by, stop to admire the youngest child and slip a box of sweets into its pram. The box contained film of secret Soviet papers that Penkovsky had copied with his Minox camera.The idea was that anyone watching would assume it was an innocent, chance encounter between a matronly-looking foreign woman and an avuncular Russian man. </p> <p>What no one in the west realised until too late was that the KGB already knew that the job of \"visa officer\", held by Janet Chisholm's husband, was just a front and that he was actually MI6's head of station in Moscow. The KGB knew this because Ruari Chisholm's previous posting was in MI6's Berlin station, where one of his fellow MI6 officers was George Blake, who had already secretly gone over to the KGB. Blake later admitted that he had given the KGB the names of every MI6 officer he knew. </p> <p>So not only Ruari Chisholm but his wife was also under intense KGB surveillance from the moment they arrived in Moscow. Every time Mrs Chisholm left the embassy she was followed and photographed. It did not take the KGB long to identify the avuncular Russian who met Mrs Chisholm and her children as Penkovsky. </p> <p>But the KGB did not act immediately. It had to consider the possibility that the GRU was trying to recruit Janet Chisholm or that there was some other reason why Penkovsky was meeting her. Any hasty KGB move might wreck an operation by a sister intelligence service and then there would be hell to pay. But a KGB search of Penkovsky's apartment when he was out revealed his cache of spying equipment and incriminating papers. He was arrested, and the Chisholms had to use their diplomatic status to leave the Soviet Union quickly. After a show trial at which Penkovsky confessed, he was found guilty of treason and shot. </p> <p>Aspects of the Penkovsky affair remain controversial. Blake's confession that he had revealed to the KGB that the Chisholms were MI6 officers came in the middle of the Penkovsky operation. Therefore, MI6 had to accept that the KGB were on to Penkovsky because of his meetings with Janet Chisholm. Yet, instead of warning Penkovsky, MI6 allowed the meetings to continue. The then chief of MI6, Sir Dick White, said later that Penkovsky's determination to continue his work and the value of the information he was providing justified leaving him in danger. </p> <p>But the value of Penkovsky's information has since been disputed. Although at the time every morsel was seized on by western intelligence experts, they now find it difficult to identify any single piece of military information that Penkovsky brought which proved to be of major value. One theory is that Penkovsky wrote his message in broad brush strokes. It dealt with capabilities and intentions. President John Kennedy read it and understood. Both he and the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev were educated into the realities of the nuclear age. </p> <p>Janet Anne Deane was one of four daughters of a Royal Engineers officer, born at Kasuali in the foothills of the Himalayas. She was educated at Queen Anne's school, Caversham, where she learnt Russian. She studied French at Grenoble university and attended a secretarial school in London before joining MI6 at the Allied Control Commission in West Germany, where she met her future husband. </p> <p>After Moscow, the Chisholms were posted to Singapore and then had two spells in South Africa. Ruari decided to take early retirement from MI6 and become an author. But he contracted cerebral malaria in Tanzania and died in Scotland a few weeks later. </p> <p>Janet Chisholm continued a life of adventure, and in her 70s went backpacking around Australia and trekking in Tibet. But she never really abandoned the secret world and declined to talk or write about the Penkovsky case and her role in it, despite many attractive offers to do so. </p> <p>She is survived by two sons and two daughters.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Janet Anne Chisholm, born May 7 1929; died July 23 2004</p>",
  "After 40 years working for the Soviet Union's interior ministry, Ina Ilyina was naturally suspicious of what democracy would bring. But like most people, she held on through the turmoil and trusted that better times were ahead. <p>Now, more than 10 years later, with Russia poised to dismantle one of the signature schemes of the communist era, she speaks bitterly about her country's leaders. </p> <p>Like an estimated 30 million other Russians, she will be affected by President Vladimir Putin's plans to abandon the former Soviet system of benefits for the old, sick and needy. </p> <p>\"I trusted [Boris] Yeltsin. That was my mistake. He is an alcoholic, a mafiosi, he sold out everything,\" says Ms Ilyina, 72, whose monthly pension of 4,600 roubles (\u00a386) is among the more generous awarded to Russian retirees. </p> <p>\"It's a burglary of the elderly. They are stealing from the people, stealing from the dead.\" </p> <p>A plan to replace this treasured system of social benefits, which includes housing subsidies, free public transport, discounts on prescription medication, free artificial limbs and spa treatment, with a straight cash payment has sparked weeks of noisy demonstrations, the first since Mr Putin took power in 2000. </p> <p>Many fear the new payments will in no way make up for the loss in benefits to some of Russia's most vulnerable people, including second world war veterans. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the Duma, or lower house of parliament, quickly pushed the legislation through both its second and third readings last week. The Federation Council, or upper house, held a rare Sunday meeting to give the bill its stamp of approval. Now all that remains is for Mr Putin to sign it into law, a task he is expected to perform by tomorrow. </p> <p>In a last, desperate attempt to stop him doing so, human rights groups delivered an 80,000-signature petition to the Kremlin on Monday. They received no direct response. But the next day Mr Putin appeared on state television, thanking parliamentarians for their \"thorough and well-balanced consideration in implementing the reforms. This is a very important and very sensitive package, and I'm pleased that the Federation Council members have treated it very attentively.\" </p> <p>The attitude has disheartened thousands of Russia's pensioners, many of whom will struggle under this legislation. For the poorest pensioners, who often use the metro or buses to travel around the city to collect and return empty glass bottles for a few kopecks apiece, even the 10-rouble (19p) metro fare will quickly eat into any money they might earn. </p> <p>Under the new system, Ms Illyina will lose her housing benefit. Her pension will have to cover a 1,200-rouble rent, 600 roubles a month for medication to control her diabetes, as well as the costs of public transport and her phone service. </p> <p>In return, as a second-category invalid and a labour veteran, she should receive an extra 650 roubles a month. </p> <p>\"Of course we are against [the change.] It's so bad. We are in a bad state already,\" says Ekaterina Odintsova, 82, who is living in poverty after 30 years of cleaning a Moscow children's home. Her 2,400-rouble pension is now barely enough for food, on top of the 800 roubles a month she pays as half-rent and for electricity and the phone on the two-room flat she shares with her granddaughter. </p> <p>With both her son and daughter-in-law dead, she is most worried about having to pay for public transport. </p> <p>\"I use public transport all the time, to buy groceries at the market,\" says Ms Odintsova, lifting her frail arms to show the two lumpy bags in her hands, and smiling slightly to show the two remaining, stained teeth behind her sunken cheeks. Her eyes are weak, but there is no money for glasses, nor will she visit a doctor for fear of having to pay. </p> <p>The cash payments under the new system start at 450 roubles a month for average pensioners, and run as high as 3,500 roubles a month for those holding government medals of honour. </p> <p>The new system's supporters say it is a necessary reform that streamlines the state budget and equalises benefits, since villagers living far from Moscow, for instance, cannot make use of free metro travel. </p> <p>The prime minister, Mikhail Fradkov, told a cabinet meeting that the move was \"economically substantiated, socially fair and, in our considered opinion, must improve the lives of Russian citizens\". </p> <p>But in a country where salaries are often paid late, and where inflation and bank crises have robbed thousands of people of their life savings, money is simply not trusted. </p> <p>And none of the amendments has won the hearts of Russia's elderly, who suffered the devastation of the second world war as well as persecution at the hands of the state. </p> <p>\"The procedure of adopting this law has been insulting and disgraceful,\" says Lev Ponomaryov, a Soviet-era dissident who is now head of the For Human Rights movement. </p> <p>\"This is changing the state's status as a social state.

  "Three European countries scrambled fighters to intercept a Spanish airliner which flew for hundreds of miles without responding to control tower messages, raising the fear that it had been hijacked, airline sources confirmed yesterday. <p>As the Boeing 737 flew 186 passengers from Bergen in Norway to the Spanish holiday island of Majorca, the Danish, French, German and Dutch air forces were put on alert for a potential suicide mission similar to the September 11 attacks in the US. </p> <p>Germany, the Netherlands and France scrambled fighters in fear of an attack on Brussels or Paris to mark the first day of the EU's enlargement, the Spanish paper El Pa\u00eds reported yesterday on the basis of on official documents from the Netherlands. </p> <p>The scare on May 1 ended when the chief cabin attendant in the airliner looked out of a window and saw two French fighters. </p> <p>She told the pilots, who radioed the fighter pilots and assured them that the airliner had not been hijacked. </p> <p>The airline pilots, named as Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and Enrique Mart\u00edn, failed to respond to calls from a control tower in Denmark shortly after leaving Norwegian air space. </p> <p>The air traffic controllers alerted the defence forces, who passed on the warning to Germany, since the plane had then entered German air space. </p> <p>Two German F-4 fighters were scrambled as the plane failed to reply to Dutch air traffic controllers in Limburg. </p> <p>The Boeing was called on normal and emergency channels, Dutch investigators in Haarlem said in the report quoted by El Pa\u00eds. </p> <p>Two Dutch F-16s were sent up when Eurocontrol, which is responsible for airspace over Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and part of Germany, also received no reply. </p> <p>As the plane approached Brussels the two French fighters appeared and their pilots spent 10 minutes trying to raise the airliner, using three separate frequencies. </p> <p>The airline pilots told the Dutch police that their radio was on and they had not found the 20 minutes of radio silence strange, El Pa\u00eds reported. </p> <p>They considered the flight to have been \"normal and routine\" and said they had at no time carried out sudden manoeuvres which might make the fighters suspicious. </p> <p>Air Europa said yesterday that it had investigated the incident and concluded that nothing strange had happened. </p> <p>Its spokeswoman claimed that Eurocontrol had dealt with 20 other \"alarm situations\" in the first 10 days of May, but she was not aware of fighters being scrambled in any other case. </p> <p>She offered no explanation as to why the pilots might not have heard the air traffic controllers and failed to detect the French fighters.</p>",
  "<p>On Monday British Airways announced a \u00a3160m swing back into the black, declaring profits of \u00a3115m in the three months to June. In the same period last year, BA registered a \u00a345m loss. Most chief executives would have been happy, said the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>'s Philip Aldrick, but not this airline's boss, Rod Eddington. \"Like most Aussies, Rod is hard to please,\" reckoned Aldrick. Mr Eddington had described the results as \"reasonable\". </p> <p>Despite the good news on profits, BA shares had slumped by 7.5p to 205.5p by the end of Monday. \"If an airline wants to eclipse a bound back into profitability, it cannot do a lot better than British Airways,\" observed Martin Flanagan in the <strong>Scotsman</strong>. \"Say you're going to more than double your already controversial fuel surcharges; remind everybody that you have a ground-staff strike on hold; and say that the short-haul market remains bloody. It about did the trick.\" </p> <p>The airline reacted to rising oil prices - a barrel of crude topped $45 (\u00a324.65) on Tuesday - by raising its fuel surcharge on long-haul tickets from \u00a32.50 to \u00a36 a flight. Yet the levy would only offset a third of BA's \u00a3225m extra fuel costs, said the <strong>Financial Times</strong>'s Lex column, and scope for \"further charges [was] limited\". US competitors were already finding it hard to impose such levies, Lex noted, and BA's domestic and European business was facing cut-throat competition from low-cost carriers. This explained why it \"has decided not to increase the \u00a32.50 fuel top-up its short-haul passengers pay per flight\". </p> <p>The <strong>Independent</strong>'s Michael Harrison felt BA had \"some leeway on long-haul\" as all its competitors were \"also passing on higher oil prices [as] the effect on ticket prices is proportionally less\" than in short-haul. Robert Cole pointed out in the <strong>Times</strong> that BA was \"not making profits\" in the short-haul sector and \"seems unlikely to do so before key competitors are bowled\" in an unsustainable \"fight to the death\". </p> <p>There were also concerns about whether BA's ground staff would vote next week for industrial action. Lex noted that last year's wildcat strike cost the airline \u00a340m. With that in mind, the <strong>Daily Express</strong>'s Stephen Khan urged BA union members \"to consider the damage to the airline by strike action, whether official or wildcat, should the negotiations between their leaders and the company break down. Passengers will be unforgiving if their travel plans are disrupted this summer.\" Cost-cutting had been the bedrock of BA's return to profits, said Khan. \"With average fares down, oil costs up ... BA cannot afford a repeat of last year's disruption. If there are walkouts Mr Eddington will have to explore further job cuts to add to an already savage cull.\" </p> <p>A more worrisome problem, agreed the business commentators, was the airline's pension fund, especially in the long term. \"Its deficit stands at just over \u00a3928m, around half of BA's market value, making it one of the most exposed companies in Britain to the retirement funding crisis,\" explained Ruth Sunderland in the <strong>Daily Mail</strong>. \"The company has pledged to pay more than \u00a3133m a year for the next decade to plug the gap - a huge drain on resources given the size of its debt.\" </p> <p>Those debts, although down by \u00a3334m in the past quarter to \u00a33.8bn, are still short of Mr Eddington's target of \u00a33bn, said Flanagan in the Scotsman. \"The good news for BA is that the long-haul business traffic is coming back, slowly but surely.\" </p> <p>BA's fortunes face another hurdle, it emerged this week. The Italian government, which owns the failing carrier Alitalia, is threatening BA with legal action unless it agrees to raise its airfares on lucrative transatlantic routes to and from Italy, said the <strong>Wall Street Journal Europe</strong>. Rome says BA is in breach of \"long-standing bilateral transport agreements that protect national carriers\". All foreign airlines, except BA, have complied and raised their prices. </p> <p>\"BA is taking a calculated gamble, arguing that the protectionism in the old bilateral treaties has been overtaken by the single European market,\" said the paper. \"The EU has a good test case on its hands ... EU regulators will take weeks to decide whether it's against the law, as well. By that time, Alitalia may be no more.\"</p>",
  "Melbourne is under threat from an invader straight out of a horror film: a giant column of ants 60 miles across. <p>The supercolony of Argentine ants - a species that arrived in the country from South America in the 1930s - has swamped the city. </p> <p>The insects do not harm humans but they disrupt the ecosystem and have been known to overwhelm and kill hatchlings in chicken farms. </p> <p>Researchers at Monash University say the supercolony has developed because a genetic mutation has stopped the ants from fighting among themselves, which normally keeps their number in check.</p>",
  "<p>Pentagon auditors have concluded that Halliburton, the chief contractor in Iraq, has failed to properly account for $1.8bn (\u00a31bn) in charges billed to the US government. </p> <p>The findings, laid out in a 60-page report, threaten to put fresh political pressure on Halliburton's former chief, vice president Dick Cheney. The company has stumbled from one scandal to another, providing ammunition for Democrats in the run-up to November's presidential elections. </p> <p>The amount in question represents 43% of the total $4.18bn that Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown &amp; Root has charged the US government for providing logistical support to troops - everything from meals to towels. </p> <p>KBR has a separate contract helping to restore oil fields in Iraq. It has billed the government for $6.3bn so far. </p> <p>The Pentagon has previously threatened to withhold payment on some charges owing to disputes with Halliburton on its methods of accounting. Officials have accused KBR of inflating prices for oil it imported from neighbouring countries immediately after the war. </p> <p>The Pentagon pays Halliburton for work under way and the company is required to provide detailed billing to justify the payments. </p> <p>The Wall Street Journal, which had sight of the report, said the audit found KBR's \"internal control policies\" were \"inadequate for providing verifiable, supportable, documented cost estimates that are acceptable for negotiating a fair and reasonable price\". </p> <p>Halliburton said it disagreed with the findings and would issue a response within the time set out by the government. It argued that the authors of the report were acting in an advisory capacity only and that normally such reports \"are part of a lengthy but routine process that is amicably resolved\". It added that \"only in an election year when Halliburton is being covered in a political context as opposed to business\" does this kind of dispute become news. </p> <p>\"As we have stated previously, we believe these issues will be resolved in our favour,\" the company said. \"Even if they are not, we don't believe it will affect the company's liquidity because Halliburton will, in turn, withhold payments to subcontractors\". </p> <p>Democrats accuse the Bush administration of cronyism in awarding the company so much business.

  "<p>Sell out<br> The expansion of eBay (The web's Wal-Mart, August 5) has certainly been amazing, but I suspect it has reached its peak now that businesses are flooding in. </p> <p>Auctions in some areas are becoming meaningless, as identical items are listed in endless succession by the same trader. When it is nearing the end of an auction, if the trader does not feel it has reached a satisfactory price, the item is pulled out as \"no longer available\" or \"error in description\".

They put in a guaranteed winning bid, leaving those who have been bidding for seven days or more angry and frustrated. </p> <p>Usually you can buy new items more cheaply by using a search engine and I am sure many others like me are giving up using eBay.

These are matrix deals, which produce a few winners and a lot of losers. If you are the 10th person and the matrix is 25, you won't get anything until person number 250 buys in.

  "An Italian envoy will fly to Libya tomorrow to discuss radical plans to set up \"reception centres\" for would-be immigrants, with officials from both countries estimating that up to 2 million people have already massed on the north African coast in readiness for an opportunity to travel by boat to Europe. <p>The scale of the problem has been recognised by President Muammar Gadafy's regime, which has indicated that it needs help to deal with the number of people who have travelled to Libya's poorly patrolled coast and the vast open deserts to the south. </p> <p>The reception centre proposal, which has drawn criticism from some quarters, is part of a series of cooperation initiatives Italy is spearheading in an effort to control the flow of desperate illegal immigrants across the Mediterranean from northern Africa. </p> <p>Libya is the only north African country which does not have a formal agreement with the EU on tackling illegal immigration, and has become the focal point of refugees, most of whom have travelled from across Africa and the Middle East. </p> <p>The debate over illegal immigration has become a major political issue in Italy. It flared again this week when African boat people said they had thrown the bodies of 23 fellow travellers overboard after they died of dehydration and exhaustion on the 15-day Mediterranean crossing. </p> <p>One member of Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet said all would-be immigrants should be sent home rather than be allowed to land. </p> <p>As Italy urged help from the EU, Libya's foreign minister, Muhammad Abdel-Rahman Shalgham, said his country needed cooperation to tackle the problem. \"If for you Italians illegal immigration is a problem, for us it's much more - its an invasion,\" he told the Italian daily newspaper La Stampa. </p> <p>Since Tripoli decided to come out of the international wilderness and revive ties with the west, cooperation on immigration has begun. Libya has begun to police its southern borders with Chad, Niger and Sudan, with the aim of ultimately pushing the immigration frontline further south into Africa. </p> <p>But Tripoli has often complained that sanctions meant it could not acquire the necessary night vision equipment, bullet-proof border patrol vehicles, surveillance motorboats and aircraft for repatriating would-be illegal immigrants. </p> <p>Under proposals which the head of Italy's immigration police, Alessandro Pansa, will present to Libyan officials tomorrow, Italy's immigration police and other authorities would advise Libyan officials on setting up the reception centres. </p> <p>Italian officials in the past have suggested that Tripoli had deliberately \"opened the valve\" of immigrants heading for Italy to increase the pressure on Europe to lift its economic embargo. </p> <p>Now, after Colonel Gadafy's government has taken another step towards normalising its relations with the west by agreeing to pay compensation for the victims of a bombing of a Berlin nightclub in 1986, Germany is showing signs of a readiness to reciprocate. The Netherlands, which currently holds the EU's presidency, has reportedly agreed to raise the question of ending Europe's embargo on Libya at the next meeting of EU foreign ministers in September. </p> <p>Germany's interior minister, Otto Schily, who is visiting Italy today, is expected to propose that Rome and Berlin formalise bilateral agreements on cooperation with Libya. </p> <p>The two countries then hope to win the backing of their fellow European heavyweights, Britain, France and Spain. </p> <p>But Mr Schily has already met criticism in Germany for his plans. </p> <p>Members of the Green party and the former leader of the Christian Democrats, Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble, are reported to have accused the interior minister of trying to create \"concentration camps on the edge of the Sahara\". </p> <p>Mr Schily has insisted that the new camps will operate in the same way as those along the EU's southern shores and would not deny would-be immigrants the right to request asylum in Italy or Germany. </p> <p>He has emphasised that the proposal is designed to help deal with an emergency. </p> <p>\"It's hard to understand why a reception centre is a reception centre when it's in Lampedusa [a tiny Italian island between Sicily and Tunisia, often the chosen destination for illegal immigrants], but when it's in Africa it becomes a concentration camp,\" the German media reported him as saying.</p>",
  "Turkey suffered its third fatal rail crash in a month on Tuesday when two trains collided head-on, killing nine people and injuring scores more. <p>The trains, one of them an inter-city express, ploughed into each other near Tavsancil in north-western Turkey, about 40 miles from Istanbul. </p> <p>Salih Gun, a local member of parliament, told Reuters nine people had been killed and many injured, seven of them seriously. </p> <p>One of the trains was an express from Ankara to Istanbul and the other was travelling from Istanbul to the town of Adapazari. </p> <p>A senior transport ministry official said it appeared that one of the trains had run through a red light. </p> <p>Thirty-nine people were killed less than three weeks ago when an express train from Ankara to Istanbul crashed on the same line. </p> <p>Fifteen people were killed in late July when a passenger train hit a bus in western Turkey.</p>",
  "<p>We live in an increasingly mobile world, where we're expected to be connected to many different PCs and servers - no matter where we are or what we're doing. We may need to work on a file only to find we left it on our office PC, or we may get a call in the middle of the night asking us to reboot the mail server. The only problem is that we're miles away, and there's no chance of getting back to the PC or to the server in time. But help is at hand, because this is a job for the new generation of remote access software. </p> <p>Remote access tools come in many shapes and sizes. There are tools for helping people access desktop PCs and servers wherever they are, and with whatever device they are using. Others help support desks see what users are doing, to help solve problems. Then there are tools that deliver applications to desktop PCs and laptops, keeping the programs on servers where they're easier to manage. </p> <p>A good remote access tool uses as little bandwidth as possible, so you can use slow GPRS mobile phone connections as well as high-speed broadband. Some tools can even reformat remote screens so that you can work with them on PDAs and smartphones. PocketWatch's Pocket Hub service will allow you to control your PC from a Wap-enabled phone. </p> <p>We're probably most familiar with tools such as VNC and Microsoft's Remote Desktop, which deliver a desktop view over a network. You can use the remote machine from your current device, without having to change keyboard or mouse. System administrators find these tools useful - allowing quick access to remote servers without needing to go into the machine room. Microsoft's technology only works with Windows systems, though there are clients for Windows CE and Apple Macintoshes. The open source VNC is a different kind of beast, and supports Unix and Linux as well as Windows: this allows Linux users to work with Windows systems, and vice versa. There are VNC viewers for most operating systems, including handheld devices, which can connect to any machine running a VNC server. </p> <p>VNC was developed in the AT&amp;T research lab in Cambridge, but after it closed, several of the VNC development team founded RealVNC to manage the development of the VNC platform, and to work on commercial versions. The first enterprise version will be released next month, with security and encryption enhancements, and the ability to link into enterprise authentication services. The RealVNC team has also been involved with another company, Adder, to link VNC into a hardware remote control - a KVM box over IP. </p> <p>Apple has used the open source VNC code as the basis of its Remote Desktop tool. This can be used to install software packages, as well as watching up to 50 client desktops at the same time - not just Macs, as Remote Desktop can work with any VNC server on any operating system. </p> <p>Helping other users without leaving your desk is a considerable time saver, and it is strange that many businesses don't take advantage of the tools that are built into their PC's operating system. Windows XP includes Remote Assistance. This allows a help desk to work directly with a user's PC. Password-protected sessions allow users to control access to their PCs, and chat windows allow the helpdesk staff to communicate with them. The helpdesk can share control of the PC with the user, or just watch while the user demonstrates the problem. And Remote Assistance isn't just for the office: it's ideal for suporting users who work from home. </p> <p>Tools such as Citrix's recent purchase, GoToMyPC, allow you to use a web browser plug-in to access your PC from anywhere. Unlike some remote access tools, GoToMyPC lets you copy files from a remote PC to the system you are working on. It can be tedious working remotely over a dial-up line, so working with a local copy of a file can make things easier. 3a Lab's LogMeIn.com offers similar features, plus file synchronisation and sharing. </p> <p>Remote access support tools are an important part of the tool box for companies that provide IT services to small businesses. With the rise of business broadband, they allow support without a visit - helping the provider to work with more clients, and delivering an improved service at the same time. There's no need to wait for a visit for a simple reconfiguration. Remote access means that it can be carried out when server load permits, or in a gap between emergencies. </p> <p>Another set of remote access tools deliver applications to users' desktops. This approach means that IT departments don't have to maintain hundreds, or even thousands, of desktop installations. Tools such as Citrix Metaframe and Tarentella's Secure Global Desktop deliver the application's user interfaces while running the application on central servers, helping businesses consolidate on blade servers to keep costs down. As only the user interface is delivered remotely, it is easier to keep data secure, and it is possible to add a further layer of security by encrypting remote traffic. </p> <p>Remote access isn't just about remote desktops. It's about tools that deploy software across an enterprise; and that can help rescue and recover PCs. The more calls an IT help desk can deal with in a day, the happier the users - and it helps the business's bottom line. </p> <p>There's also a useful side effect of remote access: some tools, such as those from 1E, allow operators to turn off desktop PCs that have been left on, wasting electricity.</p>",
  "<p><strong> XP upgraded</strong><br> Microsoft has finally shipped its Service Pack 2 (SP2) for Windows XP, and the long process of updating hundreds of millions of PCs is now under way. The full download is more than 200MB, and this targets corporate networks. Those users who have already installed SP1 and other updates will have smaller downloads, estimated at around 75MB. SP2 adds new features and new versions of components such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth software, DirectX graphics and the Windows Media Player. Most importantly, it will increase security, at the expense of incompatibilities with some existing software and websites. Users of PCs with AMD's Athlon 64 processor will get a bonus, because SP2 exploits its on-chip Enhanced Virus Protection. </p> <p>Microsoft is encouraging users to obtain SP2 via XP's Automatic Update feature.

  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> After the intemperate foaming of my last column, friends suggest I might be in need of a warm milky drink and some quiet time. Well - as King Lear nearly says - need schmeed. What I want, on the other hand, is a swig of navy rum and some boisterous singalong fun. </p> <p>Sorted. I'm at C for Lost Pirates, a wildly convulsive farrago in a completely new genre that should definitely not be known as shanty-panto. Head swashbuckler is my old compadre Greg McLaren, who created the role of Dr CC Rugg in my show Napoleon in Exile. </p> <p>Lost pirates, found vests: I think of Greg as the Bagpuss de nos jours, a born ringleader who uses the reanimation of old junk to catalyse the imaginative activity of a bunch of raggedy cohorts and fellow travellers. When Greg wakes up, all his friends wake up. </p> <p>Frequently he reminds me a bit of the writer-performer Jeremy Hardingham, possibly the only theatrical genius I've ever worked with. Jeremy's vision was of theatre bursting out of its own emergency exit - an image as urgent and unstable as the work it described, particularly in Incarnate, his extraordinary 1997 Fringe show, whose traces still mark the pavements here for me, and the walls, and the phoneboxes. </p> <p>In Greg's case, likewise, it's all about that thrilling moment where the utterly private collides with the irreducibly public. There is no mediation, no lingua franca beyond what we all hold in common: the vividness of our secrets. </p> <p>Lost Pirates is, by turns, rambunctious, delicate, bewildering and hysterically funny. It's like popular theatre that has been run back and forth through a dodgy translation engine. Didn't Wittgenstein say something like: if animals could talk, we wouldn't understand what they were saying? I don't worry about whether there are geniuses in the theatre; I worry about our ability to recognise them. </p> <p>The great virtue of idiosyncrasy is how insoluble it is, how hard it is to co-opt. Lest we forget - Oliver Postgate on Bagpuss's gaff: \"It was rather an unusual shop because it didn't sell anything.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Another friend, the violinist Susanna Ferrar, whisks me off to Roxy Art House for a deeply touching programme of anti-war string quartets by Shostakovich and Tippett. (Last time I was in this space was to see a tailspinning Emo Phillips, so not everything's dumbing down ... ) </p> <p>It's a while since I've been to a chamber music concert and I'm struck, at such close quarters, by the way the players look at each other. This is not just a mechanism for cueing or regulating tempos. What passes between these musicians, in the intensity of those mutual stares, is a high-speed stream of the most complex and volatile information. The encryption and compression are mind-boggling, and the whole transaction seems to occur at a rarefied level. It is the cutting edge of sympathy. </p> <p>What if actors could share such exchanges - not just with each other, but with their audiences, too? What profound sophistication could then be possible? This is not mere theoretical footling. Everyone longs in their life to be looked at in that way. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The miserable turn in the weather delights me. It's a good excuse to try out my new Muji raincoat - the least unhip clothing I own. Eventually I catch my reflection in a shop window. I look uncannily like a fat geek who's accidentally fallen into a Muji raincoat. </p> <p>Sigh. It's the great skate pants debacle of Edinburgh 2002 all over again - a deplorable sequence of events that began with watching Dogtown and Z-Boys several times and ended in a cracked rib. </p> <p>Actually, it hasn't yet ended. I still think the skaters in Bristo Square produce the best theatre in town. Watch them rewriting that civic space, rewiring the body; check the grace, the speed, the tribal camaraderie, above all the inventiveness that arises from failure. It's exemplary stuff. How many British playwrights currently achieve anything so fluently creative and vitally engaged? You can count them on the fingers of a Twix. </p> <p>I confess a Nike advert once made me cry: night-time tennis players being chased away by cops, and the strapline: What if we treated all athletes like we treat skateboarders? In my last column I jokingly proposed the outlawing of theatre, but skaters make it more serious. If only actors were such renegades, carving out performance arenas in the city's neglected spaces, producing impromptu pieces out of nothing but velocity and live-wire virtuosity. </p> <p>It's high time theatre reclaimed the streets from street theatre.</p>",
  "It was not readily to be forecast that Sir Robert Yewdall (Robbie) Jennings would become one of the best known international lawyers of his generation, and his steady rise to prominence no doubt occasioned the subject himself some quiet surprise. By the time of his death in Cambridge at the age of 90, he commanded worldwide respect and admiration. If greatness as an academic is measured by research, teaching and administration, he was a great academic. <p>The Acquisition Of Territory In International Law (1963) and the 9th edition of Oppenheim's International Law (co-edited with Sir Arthur Watts, 1992) stand as classics: lucid, elegant, scholarly and perceptive. He taught with care and quality, and accepted wider responsibilities in his university (Cambridge) and college (Jesus). His career reached its apogee as president of the International Court of Justice. </p> <p>Jennings was born in Yorkshire. His father managed a small manufacturing firm: his mother was a mill weaver. Educated at the local village school and then Belle Vue school, Bradford, he read history, and then law, at Downing College, Cambridge, studied at Harvard and taught briefly at the London School of Economics before the war. His war service was in military intelligence and during this time he also read for the bar. </p> <p>There followed some 10 years teaching law in Cambridge, before Jennings was elected to the Whewell chair in international law, a post which he held from 1955 to 1981. The appointment was a masterstroke, as Jennings was still young (42) and not well known, but his potential had been spotted, including by his predecessor, the great Sir Hersch Lauterpacht. </p> <p>Unlike Lauterpacht, Jennings wrote only sparingly for publication, and had often to be coaxed into doing so. When he did, he expressed himself simply, but trenchantly and thoughtfully. His major scholarly contributions came late in life. Academically, he will be remembered as much for his teaching and mentoring as for his writings; countless lawyers will remember with affection his friendship and encouragement, with no hint of condescension. A draft, or a question, or the offprint of a published article, never failed to receive a thoughtful and constructive response, usually in several pages of handwritten manuscript. His kindness to young beginners in international law was inexhaustible, perhaps a legacy of the encouragement he had himself received when starting out. But it was his gift for plain expression that made what Jennings had to say so persuasive. </p> <p>In the 1960s his services began to be used increasingly frequently by the late John Blair (then responsible for international legal affairs for Shell), who saw in him the same potential as Cambridge had done, and this led to a number of productive contacts with oil industry lawyers in the US, and in due course to his involvement for a range of clients over oil rights in the Gulf, including the protracted wrangling which eventually found its way to the English courts in the guise of Buttes versus Hammer. Other work burgeoned, including offshore delimitation cases before the International Court. </p> <p>In the 1960s as well, Jennings was drawn into the Argentine team for the La Palena dispute with Chile, which had been submitted to the arbitration of the British Crown under an old bilateral treaty; and some years later, now as QC, he was on the team for the much more bitter dispute over the Beagle Channel islands which eventually required a further papal mediation before the parties could be brought to accept a modified version of the arbitral tribunal's award. </p> <p>These experiences had a deep effect on him: in the affection he developed for South America and its peoples and in his sheer delight when the Beagle Channel tribunal decided to carry out an old-fashioned descente sur les lieux to the edges of Antarctica; and of course professionally, in the stimulus they gave to the development of his views on where the real potential for judicial settlement of inter-state disputes lay, and where it did not lie, and on the relation of law to diplomacy in this area. </p> <p>When Sir Humphrey Waldock died suddenly in the middle of his term of office on the International Court, the choice of a candidate to succeed him fell on Jennings rather than on others with wider experience. The selection process was - as it is now - an entirely independent one in which the government plays no part. The government had no doubt, however, that Jennings would be an eminently electable candidate in the UN general assembly and security council, and so it proved. Embassies around the world, as they carried out the Foreign Office's instructions to bring Jennings's qualities to the attention of the local government, were told not to bother, as the person being lobbied had himself been a Jennings pupil and knew perfectly well what a fine candidate he was. He was comfortably elected to a full term in his own right in 1982, and his judicial opinions became known for their clarity and good sense. </p> <p>In 1991, at the age of 78, he was elected the court's president, holding office until 1994. Under his presidency, Jennings placed a premium on maintaining its unity and cohesion. He could not abide faction, nor the division of the court into linguistic camps, and invariably exercised his influence in favour of moderation. He did not share the gloomy foreboding of some of his colleagues that the creation of new tribunals in specialised areas like the law of the sea or international trade posed a threat to the international court - so long as there was a proper recognition by all of the need to preserve the unity of international law itself and of course to respect the court's status as \"the principal judicial organ of the United Nations\". </p> <p>He was eager that the court should organise itself so as to be able to function as a specialist tribunal in the environmental area, but realistic about the contingent role of permanent courts where other means of dispute settlement were available. He knew intuitively that, if international law and international adjudication were important, then they had to be argued for, and he used his position to lay the foundation for a more reasoned dialogue between the court and the UN general assembly, with full respect for the court's judicial independence. </p> <p>He was particularly upset by the failure of the leading British newspapers to take the court seriously, and it was under his presidency that the reporting of its judgments was put on to a more satisfactory footing. </p> <p>Jennings loved living in the Hague. True to his own Yorkshire roots, he found the Dutch instantly congenial; their straightforward and practical nature, freedom from pomposity and good nature appealed strongly to his own, and he seemed never happier than when sitting in the Haagsche Club surrounded by other plain men who'd done their bit in the world but remained concerned about its future and wanted to talk about it, though quietly. </p> <p>After completing his presidency he went back to live in Grantchester (although he remained formally associated with the court as judge ad hoc in the Lockerbie disaster cases). Academic honours flowed: presidency of the Institute of International Law; honorary doctorates from Hull, Leicester and the Saarland, as well as Oxford and Cambridge; the Hudson medal of the American Society of International Law; and Leicester gave his name to a chair in international law. The world was no more inclined to let his talents go to waste than he himself to want to waste them. One good example was the arbitral tribunal between Yemen and Eritrea, over which he presided with grace and sensitivity. Another, equally characteristic, was his unhesitating response to the request of the executive head of one of the international financial institutions, to act as a wise mediator in a particularly delicate staffing matter. At a dinner in Cambridge to celebrate his 90th birthday his speech was characteristically reflective, stimulating and youthful. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Christine: for just short of 50 years they enjoyed shared interests, including the church, music, the Lakeland fells, but above all their three children. Jennings's private life was never on display, but its strength and values permeated everything he did.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Robert Yewdall Jennings, international lawyer, born October 19 1913; died August 4 2004</p>",
  "The woman shot dead with her husband in a Lincolnshire village had called police only minutes before to say a strange man had been lurking outside, it was revealed yesterday. <p>Joan Stirland, 53, phoned Nottinghamshire police on Sunday afternoon to report a prowler near her bungalow in Trusthorpe, Lincolnshire, the previous evening. </p> <p>Less than 30 minutes later, at 2pm, she and John Stirland were murdered by two gunmen wearing dark blue boilersuits. </p> <p>Lincolnshire police said that the couple called Nottingham because they were unwilling to inform the local force that they were afraid for their lives. </p> <p>They had fled Nottingham, their home city, to go to the Lincolnshire coast when they were threatened after Mrs Stirland's son, Michael O'Brien, 23, murdered a man outside a pub in Nottingham in August 2003. </p> <p>Although not under any formal witness protection scheme, the couple kept in regular contact with Nottinghamshire police, who had warned Lincolnshire police that they were at risk. </p> <p>Since the murders, Mrs Stirland's two daughters have been under police protection, it was revealed last night, as the first pictures of the dead couple were released. </p> <p>While O'Brien remains in the high-security Whitemoor prison in Cambridgeshire after receiving a life sentence last month, there are growing fears of further revenge attacks. </p> <p>A source close to the investigation said that one daughter had been taken away from Nottingham for her safety, and that the other, who did not live in the city, was also being looked after by police. </p> <p>A spokesman for Lincolnshire police added: \"We are offering them support. We are looking after them at the present time.\" </p> <p>Appealing for witnesses, police said the couple must have been killed between 2pm and 2.30pm, when a dark-coloured VW Passat used by the gunmen was found burning two miles from their home. Just earlier, the car had been seen parked near the couple's home with its hazard lights flashing. </p> <p>Detectives are investigating what could have led the killers to the couple's home. </p> <p>One of Mrs Stirland's daughters and three grandchildren made regular visits, while several weeks ago old friends of the couple bumped into them on the Lincolnshire coast. </p> <p>Word also spread of their new life when they returned to Nottingham two weeks ago for the wedding of one of Mr Stirland's two children by a previous marriage. </p> <p>The couple were murdered less than a week after the best friend of O'Brien's victim was found dead. </p> <p>According to his mother, Jamie Gunn, 19, never recovered from the shock of seeing Marvyn Bradshaw shot dead by O'Brien and died of pneumonia on August 2. One theory that detectives are exploring is whether associates of Mr Gunn were involved in the murder of Mr and Mrs Stirland. </p> <p>Emotions run high ahead of Mr Gunn's funeral on Friday in the Nottingham suburb of Bulwell. While he was thought to have had an altercation with O'Brien before Mr Bradshaw was shot, Mr Gunn's mother, Julie, said he did not see the face of his best friend's killer until O'Brien appeared in court. </p> <p>\"He was glad that justice had been done,\" she said. \"But he went back to thinking about Marvyn again. He had the vision of that night in his head. </p> <p>\"Jamie held Marvyn in his arms after he had been shot. I think he may as well have died then, too,\" she told the Nottingham Evening Post. \"He went downhill after that. He could not cope.\" </p> <p>Police are also still hunting for Gary Salmon, 32, whom O'Brien accused in court of shooting Mr Bradshaw. </p> <p>Lincolnshire police confirmed that they were closely liaising with officers from Nottinghamshire police who were leading the search. There is a \u00a310,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Mr Salmon, who was known to have a string of assumed names and associates across the country.</p>",

  "Not since the legend of little Hans Brinker has a dyke caused such a furore. This week the television watchdog, Ofcom, ruled that Richard Madeley, one half of Channel 4's Richard &amp; Judy, was wrong to use the word \"dyke\" as a synonym for lesbian in a feature about tanning. Richard was surprised by the fuss it has caused; apparently, he thought the term was no longer offensive, and indeed had employed it in an attempt to be \"hip\". Dear, we think the fashionable phrase you were looking for is \"hot lesbo girl-on-girl action\". Anyway Richard, we hereby label you an utter prat. In an inoffensive, hip sort of way, obviously. <p>Earlier this summer, we told you about She-pees, female urinals that allow a speedier trip to the powder room. Today, we bring you news of the latest invention to combat queues in the ladies': the Bog Off system, enjoying a trial run in Brannigans' pubs, has cubicle doors that leap open after a minute, to ensure that you have, ahem, \"gone in 60 seconds\". Where, we ask, will this madness end? The ladies' lavatorial queue is an institution, a bonding experience. So let's start the backlash, so to speak, against this new-fangledry: we instruct you to practise your pelvic floor exercises as a matter of urgency. </p> <p>It seems we have long been labouring under the misapprehension that children should be seen and not heard (well, trying to labour, if only someone would look at our CVs). This week we learned that children should be neither seen nor heard, at least not in the workplace. At an employment tribunal, accountant Diane Winship claimed that she had been advised by her local jobcentre to delete all evidence of motherhood from her curriculm vitae, thus bettering her chances of finding work. And the prejudice starts before the gestation period is even up - an Equal Opportunities Commission survey has revealed that pregnant workers are frequently overlooked for training, while many employers are unaware of how long maternity leave should be. So what is the solution? Better legislation? Increased paternity leave? We say the sensible answer is to reintroduce child labour - then we will certainly appreciate motherhood in the workforce. </p> <p>Wonderful \"advertising feature\" in this month's Vogue, showing attractive young women swanking about in designer furs. \"Women everywhere are embarking on a love affair with fur,\" apparently.

  "In a New York Times review of Nicholson Baker's new novel, Checkpoint, Leon Wieseltier employs the phrase \"liberal demagoguery\". He does so not as a cultural relativist might, in reference to western promotion of secular-liberalism, but in response to what he sees as the left's adoption of the right's penchant for crude reductionism. <p>The plot of Checkpoint concerns a man who is so disenchanted with what George W Bush has done to America and the world that he plots to kill the president, or at least fantasises about it. In real life, liberals on both sides of the Atlantic are increasingly lending their support, if only vocally, to simple solutions to what is in Iraq, and elsewhere, a complex situation. </p> <p>At its most innocuous, this tendency manifests in uncritical applause for Michael Moore. I'd be a wealthy man if I had a quid for every time someone had told me that they didn't care whether or not Moore was a reliable documentary-maker just so long as he is against the war in Iraq. </p> <p>In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore seems to suggest, with good reason, that the Iraq war was a needless diversion from the hunt for Osama bin Laden and his followers. But point out that he was against going after Bin Laden when the US invaded Afghanistan, and that his initial response to the attack on the World Trade Centre was that it was wrong because New York \"voted against Bush!\", and few of his new fans appear bothered. Yeah, they say, he may not be consistent, but he's a counterbalance to the mad neocons. And that's all that matters. In other words, to use the old Arabic saying, my enemy's enemy is my friend. </p> <p>In which case, you can end up with some very strange friends. Recently I voiced the opinion that the tragedy of the war in Iraq, aside from the many innocent dead and injured, is that is has created the conditions in which reactionaries such as Moqtada al-Sadr and his followers can flourish. The woman I shared this thought with, a cultured liberal who cut her teeth in the anti-Vietnam war movement, looked at me in disbelief. \"But they're freedom fighters,\" she said with something that sounded like pride. </p> <p>Now Sadr's militiamen may be fighting for a number of things. Two young Britons were reported yesterday to have joined Sadr's Shia militia in Najaf to fight a \"jihad\" to defend their religion. (Perhaps, but the fact is that the Shia enjoy more liberty to practice their religion in Iraq now than they did under Saddam Hussein, whose ruthless anti-Shia policies seemed to inspire few British jihadists.) Certainly it is possible to argue that, in terms of removing an occupying force, they have a just cause. But what they are absolutely not fighting for is freedom. </p> <p>Freedom may mean different things to different people but there are limits to how much you can stretch the word and those limits stop worryingly short of the Iraq that Sadr would like to see. The kind of \"freedom\" Sadr aims to establish is the kind that operates in the neighbouring theocracy of Iran. A broad spectrum of opposition forces helped depose the shah of Iran back in 1979 but Ayatollah Khomeini, Sadr's role model, was not much interested in pluralism. Thus, when he assumed control, he had his erstwhile anti-imperialist comrades either imprisoned or murdered. </p> <p>At the time, a number of European intellectuals were excited by the the extremity of Khomeini's anti-American rhetoric. As Francis Wheen observes in How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered The World, Michel Foucault \"came back to Paris enraptured by the 'beauty' of the Ayatollah Khomeini's neanderthal regime\". But as will prove the case with Sadr if he gets the chance, the violence of Khomeini's language towards America was as nothing compared with the violence he unleashed on his own people. </p> <p>When the American-appointed Iraqi government recently closed down the al-Jazeera TV office in Baghdad, it was correctly noted that such censorship betrayed the supposed freedom that America promised to bring. Yet is it any better for liberals who oppose Bush to idealise theocratic fascists? Does that not betray the very concept of liberalism? </p> <p>Turn on Fox News in America and you'll receive a diet of neocon propaganda - not quite as hysterical as al-Jazeera, perhaps, but leaning that way. The liberal answer to such shrill warmongering not only need not match it knee-jerk for knee-jerk, it must not if it wants to remain liberal. </p> <p>The best arguments against Bush are not necessarily the loudest. He may well have got it wrong in Iraq, though that doesn't mean it can't be made more wrong or less free. My own proviso on the question of an enemy's enemy being a friend is that it only makes moral sense if the enemy's enemy is not worse than the original enemy. Liberal demagogues may not wish to recognise such subtle distinctions. But if they don't, the Iraqis could end up with a real demagogue who won't be very liberal at all. </p> <p><b>Spot the ITV documentary</b></p> <p>I was abroad during most of the so-called Svengate saga, but I saw enough to remind me that: a) no one does small-minded like the British, and b) no one does self-righteous like British journalists. In the end, and also at the beginning, the story came down to two single men having brief and separate affairs with the same single woman, and a PR behaving like a PR. Sack everyone! Like a Peeping Tom offended that his quarry sleeps in the nude, the press once again displayed its bottomless talent for moral hypocrisy. But this time it was not alone. </p> <p>When ITV's Tonight screened its interview with Faria Alam, it no doubt wanted its \"exclusive\" to be seen in the tradition of Martin Bashir's famous Panorama interview with Princess Di. But it wasn't even fit to be compared with Sky's recent one-on-one with that mistress of the mobile phone, Rebecca Loos. At least that had a sort of shameless kitsch novelty appeal. But the interview with Alam was conducted as if it really was a serious news story of constitutional importance. </p> <p>Incidentally, talking of serious news stories, of the 72 entries in this year's British Documentary Awards, ITV was responsible for screening only four. I wonder why?</p>",

Such big business, in fact, that Scousers who fled Liverpool during the long recessions of the 1970s and 1980s are being urged to return to Merseyside and take advantage of cheap property prices there. The Daily Post was understandably intrigued.</p> <p>\"Give Us Back Your Scousers\" - no, really - is appealing to expatriate Scousers who grew up or studied in the city to help fill some of the vacancies created by the city's grand scale redevelopment projects. Construction and retail firms are trying to recruit 8,000 people to work at the GBP750m Albert and King's Docks developments alone.</p> <p>\"Come back home to Liverpool,\" pleads Liverpool Needs You's website. \"Your city needs you.\"</p> <p>If knocking things down and rebuilding doesn't appeal, there are also plenty of jobs in retail. \"Skilled workers are in very short supply,\" confirmed Prof Sapsford. \"The biotechnology sector is very large at the moment and growing very rapidly.\" The expansion of Liverpool John Lennon airport has also created many new jobs.</p> <p>The city, which was once a byword for unemployment and deprivation, now has an unemployment rate of 2.9% and the fastest rate of job creation outside London. \"We're finding it increasingly difficult to fill vacancies,\" Mike Hill, the director of a Merseyside recruitment consultancy and the architect of the campaign, told the Northerner yesterday.</p> <p>Many of the emigres spent three years studying in Liverpool, but \"once they'd done a degree, they decided there weren't sufficient opportunities in the city,\" Mr Hill said.</p> <p>Liverpool's population fell by 300,000 between 1972 and 2002. In recent months, however, the city centre has undergone a minor renaissance. Property prices have risen sharply as a result, though the number of houses changing hands fell this year. Lack of housing stock and fewer first-time buyers with sufficient funds is thought to be responsible.</p> <p>An influx of skilled professionals would make things even more difficult for first-time buyers, Mr Hill admitted. \"We envisage that the vast majority of people will come from either the south-east or Manchester. If you look at house prices in Manchester or London, one of the nice things about Liverpool is that there is the opportunity to upgrade.\"</p> <p>Failure to attract enough workers, he warned, could lead to wage inflation, scupper planned developments and tip the city back into recession.</p> <p>Liverpudlians were accustomed to the notion of economic mobility, he added. Many are the descendants of families who left Ireland in the 19th century. The surge in the city's economy echoes the boom in Ireland during the 1990s, when many Britons of Irish descent headed back across the water.</p> <p>________________________________</p> <p>The Environment Agency issued scores of flood warnings and even patrolled the streets of Sheffield with a loudhailer to warn of the danger the river Sheaf would burst its banks.</p> <p>In the end, however, the river banks held; the drains didn't. A month's worth of rain fell in 24 hours over parts of the Pennines and Sheffield, leaving cars stranded in surface water.</p> <p>\"This is the third time it has happened this year, but it is the worst so far,\" a Sheffield hairdresser with a drenched carpet and flooded basement complained to the Yorkshire Post.</p> <p>The Environment Agency was unable to offer any consolation. Unless carbon dioxide emissions were reduced, it said, freak weather conditions would occur more and more frequently.</p> <p>______________________________</p> <p>Never mind the flooded basements. Liverpool's Daily Post has asked readers to help it find a far larger body of water which is apparently lurking under Toxteth in Liverpool.</p> <p>The Cains brewery in Stanhope Street, a red brick edifice built in the mid-19th century, is thought to harbour a lake. \"Stories... tell of a large, deep mass of water at a great depth beneath the Liverpool plant where workmen used a boat to travel beneath the cellars,\" breathed the paper. \"Other tales tell how it couldn't be used for drinking water because it is badly contaminated by nearby cemeteries.\" How did they know, the Northerner wonders?</p> <p>The only employee thought to have known more about the whereabouts of the lake died two weeks ago. Unfortunately, for the Post, the directors of Cains appear to be wary of allowing amateur marine archaeologists to penetrate their brewery. \"People need to understand that the brewery site is vast and the cellars are incredibly deep and we are so busy we haven't got time to look for it,\" the joint managing director, Ajmail Dusanj, warned readers. Some might regard that as a challenge.</p> <p>___________________________________</p> <p><b>DAVID WARD RECOMMENDS...</b></p> <p>It's described as a \"bold and disturbing work\" which encourages those who see it to explore their own responses to the asylum issue.

  "US-led forces today closed in on militia fighters loyal to Moqtada al-Sadr after commanders promised major operations to \"destroy\" the rebel Shia cleric's Mahdi army. <p>In the southern city of Najaf, US troops cordoned off the old town - the ancient city around the Imam Ali mosque, where many of the fighters are sheltering - and warplanes bombarded the vast Wadi al-Salam cemetery to its north.</p> <p>Iraq's interim interior minister, Hassan al-Naqib, said Iraqi police and national guardsmen had swept through the cemetery and captured 1,200 fighters, some of whom he described as foreigners.</p> <p>Later reports said that the US forces had stormed Mr Sadr's house in the old town after street battles with the Mahdi army but that the cleric was not there at the time. Mr Al-Naqib denied media reports that US forces had crossed into the Imam Ali mosque, the burial place of Mohammed's son-in-law, a revered figure among Shia Muslims.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the south, Hospitals in Kut reported that at least 72 people had been killed and 148 wounded as US airpower backed Iraqi police against the Mahdi army. In Amara, 20 fighters were killed in clashes with British forces.</p> <p>One British soldier was killed and another injured by a roadside bomb in Basra. Thousands took to the city's streets and to Shia districts of Baghdad to demonstrate against the assault on Mr Sadr's supporters. \"Long live Sadr - America and [interim Iraqi prime minister Ayad] Allawi are infidels,\" the protesters chanted.</p> <p>At least five civilians were killed in Najaf today, according to health workers. Hundreds if not thousands are believed to have fled the city since the ceasefire broke down last week.</p> <p>The assault on the Mahdi army risks inflaming Shia anger and the stability of the interim government if the Imam Ali mosque is destroyed or damaged by the US-led forces.</p> <p>Mr Allawi urged Mr Sadr's loyalists to leave the mosque and surrender. \"This government calls upon all the armed groups to drop their weapons and rejoin society. The political process is open to all and everyone is invited to take part in it,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>A spokesman for Iraq's interior ministry said Iraqi forces would lead any assault on the mosque complex. \"There is intensive fighting ... the police and the national guard are heading this operation, supported by multinational forces,\" Sabah Kadhim told CNN. \"For us, it is a crucial test of this very early stage of the government. He [Mr Sadr] is taking advantage of the fact that our forces are not fully trained.\" </p> <p>The violence in Najaf has also angered neighbouring Iran. \"The American attacks on the most sacred Islamic city will definitely elicit a strong response from the people of Iraq,\" Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted by state-run television as saying. \"They won't forgive these crimes.\" </p> <p>Lebanon's leading Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, said everything possible should be done to expel US forces from Iraq. He accused the interim Iraqi government of helping the US offensive.</p> <p>\"This government should have addressed the problems using Iraqi forces. To bring in occupation forces to control the holy sites to bomb at random, you cannot solve any problem in this military way,\" he said in a statement. </p> <p>An aide to Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most senior Shia cleric, who is in a London hospital receiving treatment for heart trouble, said he wanted to see restraint on both sides.</p> <p>As clashes raged for a seventh day, US troops said they were impressed with the militia fighters' tenacity. </p> <p>\"I think they got a reproduction facility down there. I think they're cloning,\" Captain Patrick McFall told the Associated Press. As he spoke, a mortar exploded nearby, sending up plumes of black smoke. </p> <p>In response to the announcement of an assault, Mr Sadr's loyalists in Basra threatened to blow up the city's oil pipelines and port infrastructure. A similar threat on Monday caused oil officials briefly to stop pumping from the southern oil wells. </p> <p>Mr Sadr's fighters have been battling US-led multinational forces since August 5 in a resurgence of a spring uprising that had been dormant for two months following a series of truces. </p> <p>\"I hope that you keep fighting even if you see me detained or martyred,\" Mr Sadr told his loyalists yesterday. \"I thank the dear fighters all over Iraq for what they have done to set back injustice.\"</p>",
  "<p>Brenda, who lives next door to Danny Williams's parents, is ecstatic. \"We stayed up to watch the fight on TV,\" she says. \"The whole street did. I couldn't get to sleep for two hours afterwards. Well done, Danny. It was fantastic.\" Her husband, it transpires, had 200 quid on Danny at 6-1. No wonder she couldn't sleep. </p> <p>Williams, former British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion, has always been a hero in his native Brixton. Now, after knocking out \"Iron\" Mike Tyson in four rounds on July 30, he's a hero in the rest of Britain too, and on course for a shot at the heavyweight world title, maybe as early as December. </p> <p>Best of all, he's a bloody great bloke. If you were talking nose to nose to Tyson in his mother's kitchen, you would feel petrified. With Williams, it seems the most natural thing in the world. He is knackered, jet-lagged having only just got back from the United States, has just had to sit through a two-hour press conference announcing his next fight (Oleg Maskaev in October, for boxing aficionados) and has been kidnapped by the Guardian and taken to his parents' home in Brixton - but he accepts it all without a murmur. He is the cuddliest, friendliest potential world heavyweight champion imaginable. </p> <p>The press conference, as usual for boxing, is at a plush hotel in central London. Williams's promoter, Frank Warren, gives a slick presentation and then disappears in his chauffeur-driven Bentley. Williams is about to take the tube back to his parents' house when we grab him. </p> <p>Williams's father, Augustus, a former car-worker, is surprisingly small and wiry. He is watching the racing channel when we arrive. \"My dad's a betting man,\" says Williams. \"He had a dream when I was small that I would be world champion one day, and I told him he should have had a tenner on it when I was born because he'd have made some crazy money.\" Augustus has a deep, Jamaican-inflected voice and a dry wit, but he's tough, too. When Williams was four, his father set about ensuring that his dream became a reality, teaching the boy to box. \"He used to take me on the pads to show me how to punch,\" says Williams. \"Then when I was eight he took me to a boxing gym. All this time I didn't really like it, I couldn't stand it, but he took me to the gym and got me into boxing. He's very strict and you had to do what he said.\" </p> <p>Augustus's tough love was counterbalanced by Williams's mother, a funny, welcoming woman happy to put her husband in his place. Augustus is just about to talk about his own fights as an amateur in the 60s when she interrupts. \"He wasn't a boxer,\" she says dismissively. \"He just used to go to the gym and prance about. He was a keep-fit fanatic.\" </p> <p>Williams, the doubters said before the Tyson fight, would be slaughtered; he was too nice, didn't have the killer instinct. He had lost two of his preceding six fights, had lost his European and Commonwealth titles, appeared to be on the slide. This was make or break, the last-chance saloon; as, indeed, it was for the bankrupt, hopelessly in debt Tyson. </p> <p>Tyson, indeed, came out like a whirlwind and jolted Williams, who admits he \"wobbled\". But Tyson's storm blew itself out and Williams took him apart, forcing a stoppage in the fourth round. How did the nice guy make himself turn nasty? \"When the bell sounded, I felt hyper,\" he says. \"I said, 'You've taken me away from my kids, I'm going to smash you up. I want what you've had - the big houses. I want to be able to buy my mum and dad anything they want; I want all that - and the only way I can get it is by beating you.' I was really determined.\" </p> <p>Why does a fighter fight? Not bloodlust, that's for sure. A desire for \"respect\", key word among the boxing fraternity, and for cash. Mostly cash. These men are not called prize-fighters for nothing. Williams earned $250,000 (\u00a3137,000) for fighting Tyson - by far the biggest purse of his career (though he is still waiting for a large part of it, and also complains about the weakness of the dollar). </p> <p>\"There are two things that motivate a boxer,\" says Williams. \"The first is money and the desire to live comfortably. The second is that I want to achieve great things. My heroes are Rocky Marciano, Jersey Joe Walcott and Muhammad Ali. I want to be on top of the world.\" Augustus's dream for him was very precise: not just to win one world title but to win all three of the main versions. </p> <p>If Williams had lost to Tyson, his career would have been in ruins; having beaten him, he is now being feted. His return from the US was delayed because so many television stations wanted to talk to him; he says that just walking down the street now takes him an hour - so many hands have to be shaken and autographs signed. Doesn't that get on his nerves? \"No,\" he says firmly. \"Enjoy it while it's there. You never know how long it will last.\" </p> <p>But he has no intention of repeating the wretched cycle of rags to riches and back to rags that has dogged so many fighters - not least Tyson, who earned $400m in his career, and blew the lot. \"People always say learn from your mistakes,\" he says, \"but I also try to learn from other people's mistakes. Whenever I get money from my fights, I invest it wisely. When they get big purses, fighters always go to buy the flashiest cars. I'd rather put it into property.\" He recently bought himself a Peugeot 406 coupe. Nice - but no Ferrari. </p> <p>Williams, who is 31, converted to Islam in 1999 and says his religion keeps him focused. \"My faith means that no matter how famous I get, I'll always keep my feet on the ground. It's also given me security. I feel at peace with myself.\" Islam is central to his life: after the press conference, he disappears behind a screen to pray, insisting that he be given a few minutes alone. </p> <p>He lives in Peckham with his wife, Zoe, and their two young daughters. \"Wife\" has to be qualified, because they have so far only gone through an Islamic rite which does not bind them under UK law; a register office wedding is planned but may have to be postponed if a world title fight takes place this year. He says they live in Peckham because they couldn't afford a house in Brixton. Before the Tyson fight, Williams was not a huge earner and at times in his career, to make ends meet, has had to do labouring jobs and \"door work\". He says he would like his daughters to grow up in a less challenging environment than he faced. </p> <p>He tells me that the only time he was ever in court was to do jury service, and he says it with pride. Black boys from his neighbourhood were frequently in trouble with the police; his father's iron rule stopped him from ever being tempted. \"I was going to be world champion,\" he says. \"That was programmed into me. I thought I'd get money the right way. Many times I'd seen people on the corner selling crack and driving big cars, but that never got to me because I always believed that I was going to make money from boxing. Many of my friends have got killed or been put in prison. What I've done is the proper way to go.\" </p> <p>His plan is to win the world title, have another four or five \"massive\" fights, and then quit. \"I want to make my mark, make enough money and then get out of the game. Boxing's a drug, a serious drug. It holds people - look at George Foreman, going on boxing into his 50s.\" </p> <p>Most boxing stories are tragedies - punchy fighters, going on too long because they are broke, ending up sitting on bar stools reliving dimly remembered fights of long ago. Williams, family man and Peugeot driver, recognises the occupational hazards of his trade and believes he can avoid them. Dreams count - but so do nightmares.</p>",

  "<p>Tackling homophobia and religious discrimination within councils will lead to higher productivity and improved performance, according to new guidance.</p> <p>But councils which fail to abide by the new equality laws, introduced last December, are unlikely to face censure, since there is no monitoring body to safeguard their implementation.</p> <p>The Employers' Organisation (EO) has published guidelines on implementing equality laws in the form of the Employment Equality Regulations 2003 on sexual orientation, belief and religion.</p> <p>The law seeks to prevent discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of sexuality, belief, or religion.</p> <p>The employers' body appealed to councils to take the legislation on board, to prevent \"costly investigation, mediation and settlement\". </p> <p>Currently, the scale of discrimination on the grounds of sexuality or religion remains unknown.</p> <p>Ellen Reynolds, the principal diversity adviser at the EO, believes the problem is probably similar to that of other organisations. \"It is a mixed picture,\" she said. \"I would not say local government is worse or any better. We have a long way to go, but I would not say it is any worse.\"</p> <p>Admitting her \"disappointment\" at the time taken to produce the guidelines, Ms Reynolds said promoting inclusivity within the workplace would also directly benefit councils through improved organisational performance and higher productivity.</p> <p>But she admitted that there was no mechanism in place to monitor councils' commitment on this issue, leaving implementation to the will of individual local authorities.</p> <p>Councils like Kent county council, headed up by the chairman of the Local Government Association, Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, drew up guidelines similar to the controversial \"Section 28 legislation\" - which was widely felt to be homophobic - after the government repealed it.</p> <p>Were this in breach of the equality guidelines, there would be no sanctions to compel the council to revise its policy.</p> <p>The future Commission for Equality and Human Rights, due in 2006, will encompass sexuality within its remit, alongside race, gender and disability.

  "<p>The appetite for celebrity gossip among magazine readers shows no sign of abating, with new weekly titles such as Emap's Closer and Northern &amp; Shell's New! today posting huge circulation gains. </p> <p>Closer was one of the biggest winners in the latest figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations, with sales shooting up 24.7% in the past six months to 480,187. </p> <p>In the past year the magazine, targeted at a wider range of women than Emap's other celebrity powerhouse, Heat, has seen circulation rise by 43.5%. </p> <p>And despite the new challengers, market leader Now - published by IPC - extended its lead as the biggest selling weekly celebrity title, despite a slight overall fall in sales. </p> <p>Despite exclusive interviews with the likes of Rebecca Loos, Now has dropped 2% in the increasingly competitive market to an average of 580,007 readers per week.</p> <p>IPC Connect's managing director, Evelyn Webster, paid tribute to editor Jane Ennis and her team who, she said, had \"their fingers on the celebrity pulse every week\". </p> <p>Richard Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell also had cause for celebration after New! posted impressive sales figures, rising 24.7% on the previous six months to 403,864.</p> <p>And even discounting \"bulk\" sales - copies given away to encourage people to sample the magazine - New!'s sales still rose 20.3% on the previous six months, to 347,816. </p> <p>Northern &amp; Shell's Star magazine, launched to compete with Heat at the budget price of 50p, posted a debut circulation figure of 183,674. </p> <p>Both New! and Star have been extensively cross-promoted in OK! and the Express newspaper titles, which are also owned by Mr Desmond. </p> <p>Editor Kirsty Mouatt said she was \"incredibly pleased\" with the figures, which showed there was still room for new entrants in the market. </p> <p>\"We haven't spent millions on TV advertising and have built up a loyal base of readers in a short amount of time,\" she said. </p> <p>But Louise Matthews, head of the Emap Entertainment division and responsible for both Heat and Closer, said the market was reaching saturation point. </p> <p>\"The traditional celebrity market has reached saturation. New and Star are pale imitations of the market leaders,\" she said, adding that Closer was taking more readers from traditional women's weeklies than other celebrity magazines. </p> <p>The ever-growing celebrity market appears to have taken its toll on traditional women's weeklies, with Women's Own, Bella and Best all posting a decline in circulation. </p> <p>Only Chat, published by IPC, bucked the trend, boosting its circulation by 5.4% on the previous year to 606,599. </p> <p>Emap today claimed to have overtaken the Northern &amp; Shell group for the first time to become the biggest publisher of celebrity magazines, once bulk sales are stripped out of the figures. </p> <p>Heat, which kick started the current vogue for less reverential celebrity magazines, and Closer now sell a combined total of more than 1 million copies a week. </p> <p>Heat's phenomenal growth over recent years has levelled off and the title was down 4.6% on the previous period to 540,556, suggesting it has been hit slightly by the rash of new launches in the market. </p> <p>\"We took a decision some time ago not to dilute Heat's special mix by aiming for even more readers. As long as it stays around 500,000, appealing to advertisers by attracting the 20-something woman, we'll be more than happy,\" said Ms Matthews. </p> <p>Despite repeated claims that the celebrity sector would run out of steam, Ms Matthews added that the latest figures proved that it was here to stay. </p> <p>\"Everyone was writing off Big Brother 5 at the beginning but Heat's latest issue with Nadia on the front was our biggest ever non-promoted issue,\" she said. </p> <p>In the battle of the longer established celebrity glossies, Hello! narrowed the gap on OK! magazine. </p> <p>The overall circulation of Hello! rose 3.1% on the previous six months to 361,225, while OK! dipped by 3% to 553,777. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Cloning and stem cell research could lead to fewer drug tests on animals and human patients, Robin Lovell-Badge, head of the Medical Research Council's (MRC) developmental genetics unit, said today.</p> <p>Yesterday a team at Newcastle University was granted the first licence to clone embryos and extract stem cells from them for research and scientists around the country are now watching keenly to see if they can achieve practical results. If all goes well other centres like Edinburgh, Cambridge and King's College London are expected to apply for similar licences. </p> <p>The MRC is eager to capitalise on the UK's leading position in the field, with a national stem cell bank and legislation that permits research under strict licensing. If Newcastle succeeds in blazing a trail then other research teams will want to use the techniques they develop to study a wide range of diseases. If embryonic stem cells, which have the potential to form any of the body's hundreds of different types of tissue, can be grown into, say, nerve cells, then they could be invaluable for scientists investigating Parkinson's disease or motor neurone disease.</p> <p>They could even be grown into sperm or egg cells to help with fertility treatment or to produce a supply of embryos for further research, said Dr Lovell-Badge. Another potential use would be to test drugs, he added. \"You could use human embryonic stem cell lines to test drugs for their effectiveness. You would probably have to back it up with animal studies and clinical studies as well but it would probably allow us to reduce the number of animals, as well as humans, used in research.</p> <p>\"Most drugs that are developed fail, often at the clinical trial stage because they are not effective or there are side effects. If we could use these embryonic stem cells to screen drugs we would get there faster with fewer problems.\"</p> <p>Actual treatments are some years away. \"Over the next five years we will be learning how to do things and in the following five years start to develop therapeutic approaches for particular types of disease like Parkinson's or diabetes,\" said Dr Lovell-Badge. These are both areas where doctors have experience of grafting cells into patients.</p> <p>The UK's positive attitude to stem cell research, in contrast to the disapproval of the Bush government in the US, has already prompted leading researcher Professor Roger Pedersen to move from California to Cambridge. The leader of the Newcastle team, Miodrag Stojkovic, moved to the UK from Germany to pursue embryo research. </p> <p>Others are keen to come here, said Dr Lovell-Badge. \"It's not a flood but there is a trickle and that might increase if people like the group in Newcastle can come up with the goods and show they can really do it,\" he said. </p> <p>An MRC spokeswoman said today: \"We'd like to see the UK remain at the forefront of stem cell research and we have a number of valuable assets that makes that possible - a core of excellent stem cell research teams, the UK stem cell bank which will store ethically sourced stem cell lines for research and eventually clinical purposes which will ultimately help us reduce the number of embryos needed for research.\"</p> <p>She said the government had recognised the value of stem cell research, set up a robust legal framework and given an extra \u00a340m for research so far. The Human Fertilisation and Embryo Authority (HFEA) was dedicated to ensuring only ethical legal research was granted a licence. </p> <p>The research council is encouraging international collaboration with 12 countries to share data and resources. \"Ultimately of course this is about treating some currently incurable diseases and we'd like to see a continuation of the current spirit of collaboration across the UK and beyond, to ensure this hard work bears fruit,\" said the MRC spokeswoman.</p>",
  "<p>The past few months alone have given us three movies riffing on the Cinderella theme, stories about girls striving to channel their inner princess: Martha Coolidge's \"The Prince and Me,\" starring Julia Stiles as a no-nonsense American college student who falls for the European prince who's attending her school incognito; Mark Rosman's \"A Cinderella Story,\" in which Hilary Duff plays a modern-day San Fernando cinder girl who hopes to go to college but who may be sentenced to working full time in her stepmother's diner; and Garry Marshall's \"The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement,\" in which Anne Hathaway, guided by her queenly granny (Julie Andrews), needs to find a royal mate in order to ascend the throne of the country she was born to rule.</p> <p>The problem with these movies isn't the recycled theme itself: The story of Cinderella is one with sturdy corset bones, and as plenty of cultural critics and mythology scholars have noted, it embraces a range of human hopes, desires and fears that go beyond romantic notions of finding a nice boy to settle down with. Stripped to its barest framework, the Cinderella template speaks to our basic urge to survive and to our desire for security: One of the story's earliest versions comes from China and involves a mistreated orphan whose only friend is a magic fish that helps her obtain essentials like food and clothing.</p> <p>Obviously, the princess fantasy as Hollywood has recently packaged it is largely designed to appeal to young girls - not in itself a bad thing. What girl of any age doesn't occasionally like to fantasize about being put on a pedestal - or, at the very least, to be appreciated for whatever virtues (beauty, kindness, intelligence) she might possess? The big problem with the current spate of Cinderella movies - particularly \"A Cinderella Story\" and \"The Princess Diaries 2\" - is not that they encourage unrealistically high romantic expectations in girls, but that they're barely romantic at all. Instead, even beneath their frothy, seemingly fun surfaces, there's something numbingly instructive about them.</p> <p>It's easy to see where the impulse toward this kind of mainstream instructional entertainment comes from: We want our daughters, the girls and young women of today, to know that they can do anything they want in life and that they don't need a man to take care of them. How could we not want economic autonomy and emotional security for them, particularly in a world where women still earn less than men do for comparable work? In short, we only want the best for our girls and young women - so why not give them entertainment that also builds that essential and universally unassailable commodity known as self-esteem? The problem with these new movies is that they seem to exist only to sell a line of goods - good-for-you goods, maybe, but goods nonetheless. And in some cases, even in the midst of asserting that a young woman can do whatever she wants, they still buy into the notion that a real lady (as opposed to, say, your garden-variety woman) should look and act a certain way. In \"The Princess Diaries 2\" (the sequel to the hugely successful \"Princess Diaries,\" in which an awkward California teenager learns that she's next in line to rule a small, fictional European country named Genovia), Hathaway's character has graduated from college and is now ready to return to the homeland from which her bloodline stems. The bigwigs in Genovia's parliament (and they do wear those ridiculous curly wigs) have told her that she's not allowed to rule the country unless she has a husband. Andrews, as the long-widowed current queen, argues against this old-fangled law, but there's no budging the bigwigs. And so, dutiful to her country above all else, Hathaway agrees to an arranged marriage.</p> <p>Naturally, there's another guy Hathaway likes better, although she doesn't know it yet. And anyway, the point of the movie is to show that a woman can do very well without a husband, thank you very much, and the plot rattles along toward that conclusion with an efficient clickety-clack. But along the way \"The Princess Diaries 2\" (which is rated G and seems targeted toward very young girls rather than teenagers or preteens) reinforces some strangely retrograde values. For one thing, Hathaway's character (who, with her creamy glow, looks as if she's stepped out of a Romney painting, although she's curiously lacking in that typically Romneyan mischievous spirit) wears an array of tasteful tweeds and sling-back pumps. In other words, her new royal wardrobe is all granny clothes (and not the hip kind). When Andrews shows Hathaway the apartment-size walk-in closet she's built and stocked for her, the array of dumb pastel boucl\u00e9 suits and beige heels hits like a fashion H-bomb. All that closet space for a nice-looking 21-year-old with a great figure, and not a wisp of Dolce &amp; Gabbana, or even Missoni, in sight? If not even a princess can have the spring 2004 Louis Vuitton metallic platforms, then what hope is there for the rest of us schmoes?</p> <p>But one of the beaconlike lessons emanating from \"The Princess Diaries 2,\" as Julie Andrews reminds us in a song (accompanied by a scampering lot of 12-year-old mini-princesses), is that it's what's in your heart that really counts. Thus it follows that clothes and jewels and nice things don't really matter as much as what's inside.</p> <p>That leaves all us old-school hardcore Cinderella purists stomping our little glass-slippered feet in protest: Half the fun of the Cinderella template is the extravagant loot - the fabulous gown, the coach made out of a pumpkin, the mice who turn into footmen to cater to our every whim, and so forth. Obviously, if \"The Princess Diaries 2\" fixated on such shallow concerns, it would be reinforcing materialistic values, which would be a no-no, particularly for the as-yet-uncorrupted tots at which this trifle is aimed. But that just leaves you to wonder: Hathaway's character has, smartly, studied diplomacy and political science in college. But the subtext is that if she wants to succeed in her job, she must never wear anything but dull, unobtrusive, fit-in-at-any-cost clothes. She doesn't dare to ever look or act sexy. (In one scene, she even wears a decidedly un-erotic floppy sunhat that looks like a reject from the original \"Stepford Wives.\") Her grandmother schools her in the proper way to flutter a fan - a necessity, I suppose, for any proper princess. And that she should keep her legs together at all times is a directive that needn't even be uttered.</p> <p>\"The Princess Diaries 2\" is light and essentially harmless - I don't really think that bringing your child to it will turn her into a robot matron of tomorrow. Even so, you can't watch the picture and not be at least vaguely aware of the unpleasant grinding sound it makes as it doles out its important lessons about values.</p> <p>Cheerfully dreary as \"The Princess Diaries 2\" is, \"A Cinderella Story\" may be even worse: The chipmunky Hilary Duff plays a smart cookie who desperately wants to go to college, thwarted at every turn by her jealous, Botox-numbed airhead of a stepmother (played by Jennifer Coolidge in a badly written role that abuses her formidable comic gifts). You can't turn a plot corner in \"A Cinderella Story\" without hitting a predigested self-affirmation along the lines of \"You're special!\" or \"Go for it!\" At one point, a character even says, \"Fairy tales aren't just about finding handsome princes; they're about fulfilling your dreams.\"</p> <p>There's that important new tune being thrummed again: You don't need a man to be happy. Yet \"A Cinderella Story\" wants to have it both ways. Duff's father, before he goes off to that great, Cinderella-dad beyond, tells his young daughter that to meet her handsome prince she should go to a place where handsome princes are likely to hang out.</p> <p>The answer? \"Princeton!\"</p> <p>On the one hand, it's an admirable notion: Go to school, get an education, be open to love as you find it. On the other hand, in the '50s, many women were encouraged to go to college not chiefly to educate themselves, but to find a husband. In some ways, isn't this dad saying essentially the same thing? Worse yet, Duff shows up at the ball (a school dance) in a speechlessly bad strapless white dress, her blond hair pinned up in a tousle of stiff curls, her lips slicked with bubble-gum-pink gloss: She looks like the Jenna Jameson of the Disney Channel. If \"A Cinderella Story\" is looking to sell a brainier brand of sexiness, couldn't they have come up with a better look for Princess Duff? One that's actually sexy, or at least a little less obvious than this backroom-magazine blend of undefiled youth and come-get-me-big-boy audacity?</p> <p>One of the problems of modernizing the Cinderella story is that the importance of the prince has to be downplayed. And while even without a prince the Cinderella myth would still be steeped in issues of class and self-actualization, the presence of a prince is essential to the story. Face it: He represents the promise of sex. Coolidge's \"The Prince and Me\" - the most entertaining and most thoughtful of the recent \"Princess\" movies - at least has the candor and smarts not to lose sight of that. The movie works largely because of its star. Stiles is one of the most redoubtable actresses working today, of any age: No prince, no matter how powerful or seductive, is going to slow her down.</p> <p>So in \"The Prince and Me,\" Stiles, instead of yearning to find the perfect man, has to be wooed by him. And in an unusual twist, he waits for her: He'd like her to be his queen someday, but he recognizes that going to, and finishing, medical school is her first priority. \"The Prince and Me\" allows its viewers the pleasure of seeing romantic dreams fulfilled without compromising more practical ones.</p> <p>What's frustrating about the other recent princess pictures is that they operate on the assumption that girls are insecure to begin with. Naturally, everyone is insecure, and men and women have different insecurities as well as many shared ones. But these princess movies have an anxious, helpy-helperton quality that's off-putting: They're busy alerting us that there's something within us that needs to be \"fixed\" even, possibly, before anything has gone wrong. And although they desperately strive to be modern, these new Cinderella stories do so little to improve on the old ones: Many people now in their 30s and 40s grew up watching Charles S. Dubin's \"Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's Cinderella,\" starring the quiveringly fragile Lesley Ann Warren, on television - its yearly broadcast was, at one time, something of a special event. Somehow I doubt that that 1965 \"Cinderella,\" retrograde and old-fashioned as it seems now, fostered damagingly unrealistic dreams in young children. And the charming, smartly cast 1997 made-for-TV version of the same material, with the serene and appealing Brandy in the title role, suggested that you don't have to stretch the Cinderella myth too far to turn it into a story about empowerment. This \"Cinderella\" features the horrific Whitney Houston in the role of Fairy Godmother (her abuse of melisma is a disease for which their seems to be no cure), but she does give the cinder girl one solid bit of advice: When Cinderella tells her that she's been waiting for someone to rescue her from her dismal life, Fairy Godmother tells her sternly that she must save herself. Admittedly, FG does provide the carriage, the slippers and dress. But it's Cinderella's innate kindness, intelligence and strength of character that ultimately get her out of her cinder ghetto.</p> <p>The best and most subversively progressive recent retelling of \"Cinderella\" is Andy Tennant's 1998 \"Ever After,\" starring Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott. Barrymore's character is an autodidact: Her father's last gift to her before he died was a copy of Thomas More's \"Utopia,\" which she cherishes. At one point, her nasty stepmother (played with near-glacial coolness by Anjelica Huston) snaps at her, \"Reading is for people who can't think for themselves\" - a put-down that's effective because in some ways, it flirts dangerously with being true.</p> <p>But it's not true for Barrymore's character, nor for her prince, played by Scott: They meet by chance - he assumes she's of noble birth - and commence to have lively conversations about things they've read, about ideas they've thought long and hard about. This \"Cinderella\" (her name is actually Danielle) is, as the prince discovers, \"his match in every way,\" which suggests not so much that he fits her notion of a dream man, as that they suit each other in a way that defines the ultimate in spiritual and intellectual companionship.</p> <p>In that respect, \"Ever After\" is possibly the most romantic retelling of the Cinderella myth ever, because the specific kind of happiness it speaks of is so hard to find in real life. There's love at first sight in \"Ever After,\" but it's the prickly kind that you find in romantic comedies, as opposed to the dreamy sort so prevalent in fairy tales. \"Ever After\" is a story about feminine strength as it's found in women and men. And it preserves what's fun and elementally thrilling - not to mention powerful - about fairy tales, instead of flattening them into leaden, virtuous crepes. The new breed of princess movies may pretend to be enlightening, but they're filled with empty entertainment calories: The assumption behind them is that a spoonful of medicine will help the sugar go down. But \"Ever After,\" like the most meaningful myths, speaks in gestures, not slogans. It's the kind of movie that builds character when we're not looking - which is perhaps the only way.</p> <p> &amp;#149: The Prince and Me is on general release in the UK. A Cinderella Story is released on August 20</p>",
  "In a dirty alley on the outskirts of the old city of Najaf yesterday stood a crowd of militia fighters - the newest volunteer among them a bright young biology student called Ali. <p>He arrived seven days ago, bearing a Kalashnikov, a green silk bandanna and a willingness to fight for the radical Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. </p> <p>On his chest was a green ammunition belt, filled with loaded magazines and rusted hand-grenades. Written neatly on the belt was his name, address and telephone number. \"In case I die, so they can reach my family,\" he said. </p> <p>Like all of the fighters in this group on the front line, Ali, 26, came across country from Amara, one of several southern Iraqi towns where Mr Sadr's Shia militia has fought in the past week, including yesterday when British troops said 10 fighters were killed. </p> <p>Most who take up arms for the 30-year-old Mr Sadr are young and poor. A minority, like Ali, are also well educated. </p> <p>They revile Saddam Hussein, who persecuted them, but their eagerness to fight now is largely born out of frustration that the war and occupation has brought little material change to their lives. </p> <p>Added to this is their avowed religious conviction. \"I came for the defence of Islam,\" Ali said. He and the other 20 or so fighters in his platoon describe themselves as an \"Islamic resistance\". </p> <p>Ali and his colleagues spent most of yesterday taking cover in the shade. From a window in a building above them a sniper fired out a round every few minutes into the Valley of Peace cemetery, just 100 metres away. </p> <p>On the far side of the vast cemetery are 2,000 US Marines, who have threatened to seize control of the city. Last night their commander said his troops were making the \"final preparations\" for an attack, though an early onslaught was delayed at the last minute, according to the New York Times. One of Mr Sadr's associates warned that vital oil pipelines in southern Iraq would be blown up if the US attacked Najaf. </p> <p>Occasionally a US attack helicopter passed nearby and the fighters fired off rounds from their machine guns and Kalashnikovs inexpertly. There were several command wires leading out to bombs hidden in the cemetery, ready to ambush American forces when they advanced. </p> <p>The entire scene was imbued with deep religious overtones and constant references to the Imam Ali, the Prophet Muhammad's son-in-law and a key figure in the Shia sect. \"Ali is with you,\" they said to each other in greetings. </p> <p>\"Do you think I aim when I shoot this thing?\" one machine gunner said to another fighter. \"All these things are done by Imam Ali. All I have to do is carry the thing and pull the trigger and he will help me with my aim and bring down the helicopter. It is not me that does these things.\" </p> <p>The other Shia parties hold little appeal for the fighters. \"They just use Islamic slogans to cover up what they are doing,\" said Ali. \"Syed Moqtada is a nationalist and he demands the rights of the Iraqi people and the rights of the poor. He is the only one who didn't betray the people and co-operate with the Americans.\" </p> <p>The fighters here in Najaf have rallied behind Mr Sadr, the scion of a highly respected clerical family, because unlike all other leading Shia political leaders he has so far shunned involvement in the pro-American governments. Although his radicalism is rejected by many middle-class Shias, he carries a broad appeal for those looking for a revolutionary streak in the Shia faith in Iraq. It was his father's cousin, Muhammad Baqr al-Sadr, who began the activist, or \"spoken\", school in Najaf's Shia clerical community, advocating an Islamic state through revolution until he was killed in 1979. </p> <p>Moqtada's father, Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr also acquired a reputation as a social activist until he was assassinated in 1999. Since last year's invasion his son has sought to claim that activist's mantle too. </p> <p>It is an appeal that for months after last year's invasion the US and British occupation authorities seriously underestimated. Now Mr Sadr is leading his second uprising in just five months. </p> <p>For the past week Najaf, site of the holiest shrine in the Shia faith, has been the focus of fighting, but there have been clashes in Baghdad and in southern towns that have challenged the new government. </p> <p>In an acknowledgement of the sensitivity of the conflict, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, one of Iraq's two vice presidents and leader of the biggest Shia party, the Da'awa, yesterday said US troops should stop fighting in Najaf and leave the job to Iraqi se curity forces. </p> <p>The militia will be waiting - galvanised by the words of Mr Sadr, who has urged the fighters to continue even if he is killed or captured. </p> <p>Every few hours yesterday a cleric in the gold-domed Imam Ali shrine, in the heart of the old city, issued exhortations and just after 1pm the fighters pulled out sheets of cardboard, took off their ammunition belts and headscarves and knelt to pray. Then they sat in the shade, eating grapes stored over ice in a coolbox.</p>",
  "Britons who travel to Iraq to fight on behalf of rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr could face life imprisonment for treason if arrested, the Home Office warned yesterday. <p>The threat of legal action follows the revelation in the Guardian yesterday that at least two young men from London are among insurgents battling American troops near the centre of the holy city of Najaf. Both declined to be identified. </p> <p>Among the main Iraqi Shia communities in Britain - mostly in north-west London - there was surprise yesterday that anyone would want to join Mr Sadr and condemnation of those they described as misguided and \"not well-educated\". </p> <p>The Home Office response was unambiguous. \"We find it wholly unacceptable that British citizens or those who want ... permanent residence should be trying to take up arms against British soldiers or their allies,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>\"People who do these things should be aware they are laying themselves open to prosecution and criminal sanctions. There's also a danger that this could inspire hatred against British Muslims ... the great majority of whom will want no part in this at all. </p> <p>\"It could be treason if anyone joins the enemies of this country or their allies. The maximum sentence is life and there are other offences under terrorism legislation they may face.\" </p> <p>Inside the Dar Al Islam mosque in Cricklewood, a photograph of the moment Saddam Hussein's statue was toppled in Baghdad hangs on a wall opposite an older portrait of Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr - Moqtada's father. It is clear which figure is despised. </p> <p>The allegiance of exiles remains attached to memories of the father. Few respect the path of confrontation the son has pursued. </p> <p>\"There are maybe 50 to 100 people in the area who follow [the younger] Sadr,\" explained Ali Nasser, 33, who was born in Najaf and is now studying in Britain. \"Sometimes they come here to the mosque. They have no leader or organisation. They say they followed his father, so now they will follow him. It's bad logic. These [Sadr support ers] don't study, they didn't even finish their A-levels. </p> <p>\"I was in Najaf two months ago. One of the hospitals is closed because Sadr's men used the roof to fire on Spanish troops. </p> <p>\"If I had a gun I would kill Sadr and his people. Some of them used to be in the Ba'ath party.

  "<p>Whether you've been rejected for a \u00a3100,000 mortgage or a \u00a31,000 credit card, being turned down for credit can be extremely frustrating. </p> <p>Judging by the number of emails we receive from readers, being turned down by a lender is one of the most common, and annoying, of all consumer gripes. To help you determine what the problem might be, and put it straight where possible, we have put together a list of answers to the most frequently asked credit questions. </p> <p><strong>I have never defaulted on a loan payment, I have no county court judgments or anything on my credit report that could make me look like a credit liability. Why don't they want to lend me money?</strong></p> <p> Lenders take a whole lot of information into account when deciding on whether to give you credit. This includes all the information you give them in your application form, such as details about your job, salary, home and marital status. If you've been turned down, it might not be about you, it could be about their preferences.</p> <p>\"Sometimes lenders are looking for a particular type of customer and can refuse applications simply because you do not fit this profile,\" says James Jones, consumer relations manager at credit reference agency Experian. </p> <p>It could be that the lender considers your salary isn't high enough, or your outgoings are too big for you to afford the amount you've asked to borrow, in which case they are really acting responsibly.</p> <p>Lenders verify your credit file with a credit agency to check your name and address, how much you owe and how well you've managed any other previous credit commitments. The problem may be in there somewhere. There could be evidence of problems with previous debts. </p> <p>Or, it could be as simple as not being on the electoral roll, which the credit agencies use to check your name and address. You can get on the register at <a href=\"http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk\"> aboutmyvote.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>It's important to find out what has gone wrong. As Neil Munroe, external affairs director at credit reference agency, Equifax, says: \"People can be rejected for a number of reasons, and you have to determine what those reasons are.\" If, instead, you carry on applying in the hope that another provider will say yes, you may find you are storing up problems for the future. </p> <p>Start by asking the lender - most sign up to a code of practice and will let you know the main reason for the rejection. They may just point you in the direction of your credit report, in which case you will have to investigate further.</p> <p><strong>How do I get a copy of my credit report? </strong><br></p> <p>You can contact one of the credit agencies, <a href=\"http://www.callcredit.plc.uk/corporate_scripts/consumer.asp\"> CallCredit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.equifax.co.uk/\"> Equifax </a> or <a href=\"http://www.experian.co.uk/\"> Experian</a>. A copy of your credit report costs \u00a32 and you can order your report online, by phone or by post. </p> <p>You can also see a sample credit report on Experian's <a href=\"  http://www.experian.co.uk/consumer/creditfilehelp/creditfiletour.html\"> website</a>.</p> <p><strong>If I've been turned down by one credit card company, does that mean no one else will offer me credit? </strong><br></p> <p>Not necessarily. Different lenders assess applications in different ways and some may lend to applicants that others refuse based on exactly the same information. </p> <p>However, what is known as a \"footprint\" will be left on your credit report to show that you applied for credit - whether your application was refused or granted is not shown.</p> <p> <strong>I had a couple of county court judgments (CCJs) against me a a while back. How long will these affect my credit records? </strong><br></p> <p>Mr Jones explains: \"CCJs are kept on your report for six years but are marked as satisfied once you have repaid them and obtained a certificate of satisfaction from the county court.\"</p> <p>Lenders don't like CCJs but you may find that they are more willing to offer credit once the judgments are \"satisfied\" and as they get older. After six years they can come off your report.</p> <p><strong>I have received a copy of my credit report. My brother's name has come up as we used to share a flat. He's had financial problems and can't get credit and now it seems I'm being treated the same way. Can I do anything about it? </strong><br></p> <p>At the moment, the details of other people you've lived with can crop up on your credit record. However, this is changing in November 2004. From then on, the only people that will show up on your credit report will be those who have a genuine financial link with you. For example, if you and a partner are both named on the mortgage or if you have a joint current account. \"If you are not financially connected to your brother, simply let the credit reference agencies know and they will update their records,\" says Mr Jones. </p> <p><strong>I've been turned down for several credit cards. I've been in full-time employment for 12 years and earn a good salary so it can't be income related. I've never had a credit card or a loan and someone has suggested that this might be the reason. How do I build up a credit record?</strong><br></p> <p>Having no record of past debts could, in theory, be a drawback. Mr Jones explains: \"Although lenders are probably more concerned with your current commitments and whether you have had bad debts in the past, many do like to see a track record of prompt repayment, which is why the credit reference agencies hold a lot of positive information.\" </p> <p>So if you have little or no credit history, it means lenders can't check how you manage credit. If you've had a current account with the same bank for some time, you could try asking them for a credit card. You will already have a relationship with them, so it may prove easier. If the rate of interest on your bank's credit card is higher than you'd like to pay, then be disciplined and try to pay off the full amount each month to make use of any interest-free period.</p> <p>The bank will then send positive information to the credit agencies, which will make it easier for you to get a better deal elsewhere. </p> <p><strong>I have been shopping around for a credit card. I've heard that this will leave black marks on my credit report. Is this true? How can I get all these searches removed?</strong><br></p> <p>\"A large number of credit applications on your credit report, particularly over a short period of time, can have a detrimental effect on credit applications because it can be a sign of fraud or an indication that you are desperate enough for credit to risk becoming over-committed,\" says Mr Jones. Try not to make applications when shopping around until you have found the deal you want. </p> <p>There is a difference between finding out how much a loan will cost, or asking for a quotation, and asking if you can have the money, or making an application. </p> <p>If lenders do need to check your credit report to give you a quotation, they should be able to make a \"quotation\" search rather than an \"application\" search. Both leave \"footprints\" on your file, but future lenders won't be put off by quotations searches, while applications may be more of a concern.</p> <p><strong>I've just got a copy of my credit report. It says I've made a late payment to my credit card but this isn't true and the card company agrees with me. Can I do anything about it or do I have to live with it? </strong><br></p> <p>You certainly don't have to live with it. If it's not correct, then you can get it put right. Ask your credit card company to contact the credit reference agency to correct the mistake.</p> <p><strong>My marriage broke up, I had to find a new place to live and I got behind on the repayments on a personal loan and some credit cards. I'm now settled, my finances are back on track but I'm worried about the impact these have on my credit record. Shouldn't banks take into account my difficult circumstances? </strong><br></p> <p>Now you've got yourself back on track, check your credit report to make sure your past debts are shown as paid or up to date. You can also put a 200 word \"notice\" on your credit report to explain your difficulties to prospective lenders and the fact that you have sorted them out. </p> <p>Banks are not obliged to give you credit based on that information, but they do have to take it into account when making their decision.</p> <p>There's no way of taking accurate information, however negative, off your record. It will stay there for six years, but should have less of an effect on your ability to get credit as time goes by.</p>",
  "Police investigating a double murder in a quiet Lincolnshire village today said the couple shot dead on Sunday had escaped a gun attack on their previous home. <p>Joan and John Stirland had been frightened by threats made against them after Mrs Stirland's son, 23-year-old Michael O'Brien, murdered a man outside a pub in Nottingham last August. O'Brien shot Marvyn Bradshaw in the head. </p> <p>The following month, shots were fired through the windows of the Stirlands' home in Carlton, Nottingham. Following the attack, the couple decided to leave Nottinghamshire. </p> <p>By last Christmas, they had settled in the seaside village of Trusthorpe, where their bodies were discovered on Sunday. </p> <p>Lincolnshire police today said that 53-year-old Mrs Stirland had been in regular contact with officers in Nottinghamshire since moving to Trusthorpe. </p> <p>In April, she told Nottinghamshire police she had moved there, and contacted them again on July 13 following O'Brien's conviction for murder, saying she had heard that threats were being made against her. Officers told Lincolnshire police about the threats.</p> <p>On Saturday, the day before the murders, a neighbour saw a man hanging around in front of the Stirlands' home. </p> <p>When this was mentioned to Mrs Stirland the following morning, she rang Nottinghamshire police at 11am. An officer in Nottingham phoned back at 2pm and spoke to her.</p> <p>Within half an hour of the call, the Stirlands had been killed. Witnesses reported seeing two men in dark blue boiler suits running or walking from the couple's home, and a Volkswagen Passat seen in front of the house at around the time of the murders was found burning two miles away at 2.30pm. </p> <p>Police in Nottingham contacted Lincolnshire police shortly after 2pm to tell them about Mrs Stirland's concern. </p> <p>However, Lincolnshire police today said they were told that she did not want police to take any action that would draw attention to her. Instead, she wanted them to speak to her neighbour. </p> <p>A police patrol arrived at the Stirlands' home more than seven hours later to find the couple dead. An officer noticed that the front door was open and, from outside the house, what had happened was clearly visible. </p> <p>Today, assistant chief constable Peter Davies said his force had acted properly, given that they had received a second-hand account of a person committing no obvious offence 16 hours earlier. </p> <p>\"If we had had a call from either of the couple seeking immediate assistance, we would have been there,\" he said.</p> <p>The Stirlands' murders took place less than a week after the best friend of O'Brien's victim was found dead in his home in Nottingham. Jamie Gunn, 19, was said to have spiralled into depression after the killing. </p> <p>Gunn was found by his brother and sister in the family home on August 2, having died of pneumonia. His mother, Julie, 36, said his distress over Bradshaw's murder had led him into a period of self-destruction, and that he had died of a \"broken heart\". </p> <p>O'Brien was last month jailed for a minimum of 24 years after a jury at Nottingham crown court found him guilty of Bradshaw's murder. </p> <p>As he was sent down to the cells, he taunted his victim's family, shouting: \"I don't care. Your son looked like a doughnut with a big hole in his head.\"</p>",
  "Sweeping changes to police powers were proposed by the government today, with officers in England and Wales to be permitted to arrest suspects for any offence, rather than only those which attract prison sentences. <p>The idea, included in a consultation paper published today by the Home Office - just two days after the Conservatives made a series of hardline crime and order proposals - could be on the statute books by next summer.</p> <p>But civil rights campaigners have already branded the idea of arresting people for offences such as graffiti and dropping litter \"disproportionate\".</p> <p>The 30-page consultation paper also raises a series of other proposals, including roadside fingerprinting, extending search warrants to cover all properties connected to a suspect, and greater powers for community support officers (CSOs).</p> <p>The police minister, Hazel Blears, said the moves would \"maintain the crucial balance between the powers of the police and the rights of the individual\".</p> <p>However, the director of civil rights group Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, said of the arrest proposals: \"When you create a broad, unnecessary power there is a danger of arbitrary and racially discriminatory use. </p> <p>\"This comes just a couple of weeks after statistics showed a 300% rise in the number of Asian people being stopped and searched. </p> <p>\"The Home Office says the detail will be set out in guidance - an approach which has failed as far as stop and search is concerned.\" </p> <p>\"If powers are truly needed then parliament should debate them and perhaps pass them. </p> <p>\"But I have yet to hear any serious voice in policing in this country say that the problem the police faces is that they don't have powers to arrest people for dropping litter,\" she told Radio 4's Today Programme.</p> <p> She added: \"In a democracy you do not create extremely broad powers and say they will not be used in practice - you give the police powers they actually need. </p> <p>However, Ms Blears insisted that a \"necessity test\" would ensure that not all suspects were arrested for petty crimes.</p> <p>\"What we are saying here is that in future all offences will be arrestable but that does not necessarily mean that everybody will be arrested, because there will be a necessity test,\" she told the BBC.</p> <p>\"A constable could come upon an offence and he might not be sure whether it is arrestable or not. In future that would be very clear. </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: \"Today's announcements are just another headline-grabbing initiative from a gimmick-crazy home secretary. </p> <p>\"We agree with the efforts to make the definition of arrestable offences simpler. But will we now find ourselves in a crazy situation where a litter lout is arrested and a cannabis smoker is not? \"Every arrest brings with it reams of paperwork,\" he added. \"The government is in danger of encouraging police to make arrests based on their heavy workload of paperwork and not on the seriousness of the offence.\" </p> <p> The new principal speaker of the Green party, Keith Taylor, dismissed the proposals as the \"latest in a series of attacks on civil liberties\". </p> <p>He said: \"This government already monitors its citizens more closely than any in Britain's history.</p> <p>\"The power to arrest on the suspicion of even the most minor offences undermines the fundamental right to go about one's day-to-day business without interference from the state. </p> <p>\"As with current stop-and-search procedures, there is also the risk that these new powers could be disproportionately used against members of certain communities.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>The consultation period ends in October, enabling the government, if it wishes, to table bills based on the proposals in a November Queen's speech.</p> <p>The paper - entitled Modernsing Police Power to Meet Community Needs - also suggests giving CSOs greater powers to direct traffic, tackle beggars, search people for weapons and enforce bylaws, leaving police officers free to concentrate on frontline duties.</p> <p>It also proposes that CSOs - who can already issue \u00a340 on-the-spot fines for being drunk and disorderly - be given extra powers to deal with drunks and underage drinkers. </p> <p>The proposals, which originate with the Home Office rather than the police forces, were given a guarded welcome by the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p> <p>The association's vice-president, Denis O'Connor, said: \"There is undoubtedly a need to rationalise some of the powers we currently hold and strengthen those we need most. </p> <p>\"We are supportive of the government's effort to enhance the powers of the wider police family, particularly CSOs, enabling them to assist the police in tackling crime and disorder.\"</p> <p>He added: \"However, we would sound a note of caution at any major extension of powers for CSOs before the Home Office evaluation is complete.\"</p> <p>The Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers and is opposed to the expansion of the role of CSOs, gave the proposals a lukewarm reception.</p> <p>Its vice chairman Rod Dalley said: \"Any use of or change in police powers should be taken seriously. </p> <p>\"Therefore we will carefully consider the Home Office paper and will be engaging fully in the consultation process. </p> <p>\"In particular we will be closely examining any proposals to extend the powers given to CSOs in view of the fact that no evaluation of their role has taken place.\" </p> <p> <b>Other proposals include:</b> <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Testing people arrested for property crimes for class A drugs.<br> <b>\u00b7</b> New powers to fingerprint suspects at the roadside and to take DNA samples and footwear impressions. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Allowing police to take DNA and fingerprint samples covertly - for example, by undercover officers - to determine identification of suspects and their possible involvement in an offence, although such material would be for intelligence use only and not as evidence in court. <br><b>\u00b7</b> Allowing revenue from motoring fixed penalties to fund automatic number plate recognition systems, which are already in use in 23 forces in England and Wales. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Removing the requirement for civilian investigators to wear a uniform, so that they can go \"plainclothes\" if required. <br><b>\u00b7</b> Allowing the courts to remand in police custody anyone suspected of swallowing parcels of drugs - possibly for as long as 12 days - to allow the drugs to be passed and seized as evidence.<br> <b>\u00b7</b> Create a new offence of \"keeping an incorrectly registered vehicle\" to tackle the problem of an estimated 1.2 million untaxed, unsafe or uninsured vehicles on Britain's roads. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Giving police a new power to stop, search, seize and confiscate fireworks where they suspect the items are held illegally under the Fireworks Act 2003 - which made possession by under-18s illegal. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Possible new legislation to deal with demonstrations outside parliament. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Allowing officers to photograph suspects outside the police station, and use moving images such as video.</p> <p> </p>",
  "<b> Life before</b> <br> <p> I don't think it really sank in that I was a father until I realised, a few weeks after Esme's birth, that different television adverts were now attracting my attention. Whereas Jane may have noticed she had become a parent after delivering seven pounds of baby girl, it took an advert for a Renault Espace to ignite my spark plugs. </p> <p>Laying on the sofa one night with Esme asleep on my chest, I watched a cavernous people carrier being loaded up with kids, parents, pushchairs and shopping. One thought crossed my mind: \"We really need one of those.\" </p> <p>In a moment, I slipped effortlessly into the demographic category so prized by marketeers - the aspirational parent. Jane was a few months ahead of me on this one too, and had already ordered me into the spare room, telling me not to leave until it had been magicked into The Nursery. Precious weekends were thus spent whitewashing walls, traipsing around John Lewis weighing up baby baths versus bathing seats, and seemingly ordering everything ever made by JoJo Maman B\u00e9b\u00e9. We had a bad case of what is known as FCS, or First Child Syndrome. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> The ethical audit</b><br> </p> <p> The auditors: <b> Hannah Berry</b>, writer and researcher at Ethical Consumer magazine; <b> Mike Childs</b>, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth; <b> Renee Elliott</b>, council member of the Soil Association and founder of Planet Organic shops. </p> <p> Hannah, Mike and Renee step into Esme's nursery and immediately gravitate towards the \"changing station\". Mike isn't surprised by the amount of baby paraphernalia on show. </p> <p>\"In our consumer-led society, babies have become the champion consumers,\" he says. \"There is a special baby product for every occasion and parents are encouraged to buy. Because we want our children to be well cared for and safe, we are particularly receptive to the message. But you don't always need brand new things for your baby. Babies grow so quickly that they rarely wear out their clothes - or other baby equipment such as baths, cots and pushchairs. Talk to friends and family to see if they have baby stuff you can use - and then pass on your things to friends when you don't need them any more.\" </p> <p>Hannah seems more concerned, however, with the potential sources of toxins in the room. \"The nursery was obviously freshly painted in preparation for Esme's arrival and a new carpet laid. But artificial fibre carpets of this sort are not generally recommended for small children as they can contain traces of dangerous compounds such as brominated flame retardants.\" </p> <p>This is a big issue for Mike, too. You must try at all costs to avoid products with synthetic materials, he says. \"Babies and toddlers are particularly vulnerable to the effects of certain chemicals in the environment, and yet toiletries for babies often contain chemicals which are known to disrupt their hormone systems, or to build up in body fat. Plain old-fashioned water rather than these wipes usually does the job of keeping your baby clean. Avoid perfumed creams and lotions, too, as these often contain dodgy chemicals, and take care with plastic bottles, feeding cups and feeding bowls. These have been found to leach harmful chemicals when their surfaces become scratched.\" </p> <p>Jane and I know we are going to receive a mauling for using disposable nappies. So Jane holds up one of Esme's Pampers and invites the castigation to begin. </p> <p>\"The nappy question poses many ethical dilemmas for the modern parent,\" says Mike. \"You have opted for convenience at the expense of the environment. Disposable nappies are a major waste problem, with eight million nappies thrown away every day in the UK. Ninety per cent of these end up in landfill. Disposable nappies can even make up half the contents of a family's bin. You should try using reusable terry nappies instead. You may find this is not practical all the time, but you will save money. The Women's Environmental Network estimates that using terry nappies instead of disposables can save \u00a3500 over the nappy-wearing lifetime of a child.\" </p> <p>Funnily enough, say Jane and I, the thought of battling with big safety pins and having large pots of soiled nappies on the boil doesn't really appeal. </p> <p>\"Washable nappies have come a long way from the days of terries and pins,\" replies Renee. \"They are easier to use, don't clog our landfills and, as Mike says, save you money. Companies such as Green Baby offer a large range and sample packs are available so you can try a few before buying in bulk. When you do need disposables for the quick and easy solution, you should make an effort to avoid the nasty chemicals that you find in most ordinary disposables. Artificial chemical absorbents such as sodium polyacrylate form a gel that can end up on your baby's skin as well as in the earth. There are nappies available, such as Tushies, which are gel-free, perfume-free, dye-free and latex-free. Importantly, they work. They also have wipes that are both hypoallergenic and alcohol-free.\" </p> <p>Hannah is keen to move on to the topic of the multinationals. She pulls out the bumper pack of Pampers underneath the changing station. \"Procter &amp; Gamble, the makers of Pampers,\" she says, \"has been criticised for conducting animal experiments for the development of pet food although it does claim to be committed to eliminating the need for all animal testing of products and ingredients for human use.\" </p> <p>Mike is looking through the pile of toys on the floor. \"Steer clear of plastic toys that Esme may put in her mouth,\" he says, \"especially if they're scratched or damaged. Manufacturers can no longer use plastic softeners called phthalates in teething toys for babies, but children do not always discriminate about which toys they are going to chew.\" </p> <p>Renee explains why it is so important to avoid phthalates. \"Studies are showing links to cancer and kidney damage, and scientists think it may interfere with development and the reproductive system. </p> <p>We should always check where toys are made before buying them, adds Hannah. \"Try not to buy toys made in China, where inhumane manufacturing conditions are widespread. Mattel, Disney and Hasbro were among the many companies named in a 2002 expos\u00e9 of Chinese toy factories, which found mandatory all-night 20-hour shifts, inadequate ventilation, and wages generally way below legal minimums.\" </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Life after</b><br> </p> <p>Like all parents, we thought we had done everything we possibly could - bought everything our baby requires, attended antenatal classes, created a cosy nursery, exclusively breastfed her, read all the books. So when we hear that the surroundings we have lovingly created contains toxins, and furthermore, the manner in which we are raising her is bad for the environment, we are left reeling and somewhat dejected. </p> <p>It is not until a few days later that we raise the subject again. We both agree, though, that the first thing to do is change Esme's nappies. The thought of their effect on the environment concerns us, but, to be honest, we are also attracted to the idea that washable nappies are considerably cheaper than disposables. A friend puts us in touch with the local \"nappy lady\" and shortly we receive a delivery of sample nappies. I had not realised that they could come in so many shapes and sizes. All are made from brushed-cotton terry towelling but with a variety of fastening devices - poppers, Velcro, clips. My fears of fighting regular battles with safety pins and squares of muslin cloth evaporate. </p> <p>A day or so later, and we have a bucket full of soiled nappies waiting to be washed. On the recommendation of the nappy lady, we have been sprinkling a few drops of tea-tree oil in the bucket to keep down the pong. </p> <p>We stuff all the nappies, liners and wraps into the washing machine and wash them at 60C as opposed to the 40C that the ethical auditors have asked us to stick to for normal washloads. It's our thought that having smelled these nappies 60C is the very least they should be washed at if they are to be cleaned thoroughly. An hour later, once the wash has finished, we examine the nappies closely, to see if all the stains have gone and, thankfully, it seems they have. </p> <p>About a week later, we settle on nappies made by Mother-Ease, as the poppers are the easiest to use and the nappies fit snugly. So we go ahead and order 20 more at a cost of about \u00a3200. Considering that disposable nappies can cost upwards of \u00a31,000 in a baby's first year, we justify this as a long-term investment. We are comforted further when we ask the nappy lady how long they can be expected to last and she says each will take at least two children through to potty training. </p> <p>With Esme sleeping through for about 12 hours at night, however, the washable nappies simply get too wet for our satisfaction and we opt instead for a disposable at night. We try some \"eco-disposables\" but they still don't seem to do the job so, with heavy hearts, we keep using conven-tional disposables. However, we console ourselves by noticing that the amount of nappies we throw into the wheelie bin is now down to single figures for an entire week compared to the dozens we tossed out before. </p> <p>An area we have less success with is plastic toys. We can stop buying them, but it is hard to expect friends and family to adhere to the principles of our ethical experiment. It raises a much bigger question, too, about where you draw the line. Should you impose your views on others, even if you feel passionate about them, or should you only ever try to live the best way you can and not preach to others? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> For more about Leo's experiment, and the chance to post your own views and tips, visit <a href=\"http://www.money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving\">money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving</a> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Leo's next report, on electrical gadgets, is in two weeks</p>",
  "On a late Friday evening two weeks ago, I sat in a radio studio. I had been invited to take part in a talk show discussing the extreme right. The BBC had put out its programme The Secret Agent in July, in which an undercover reporter exposed criminality within the far-right British National party (BNP). Several party members had been arrested and its main bank accounts closed as a result. <p> Since I had spent six years travelling among such extremists for my book Homeland, as well as helping to produce the BBC1 drama England Expects, the host was expecting a lively debate. </p> <p>Just before we went on air, my mobile phone rang. I left it. When I later checked, a familiar voice (belonging to a long-time BNP member) crackled: \"He, he, hear you're going on the radio? Watch what you say!\" At about the same time, mercian_valkyrie posted a message on Stormfront.org, the world's first and probably largest white nationalist website and online community. It read: \"Discussion currently on Talksport ... has Nick Ryan, the author of that bilious book about the 'far right' ... and 'infiltrator' of the BNP working for [anti-fascist group] Searchlight. Talking about the BNP, saying nasty things about NG [Nick Griffin, BNP leader]. Anyone care to speak to him???\"</p> <p> I had already warned the host that it was likely extremists would adopt such tactics. It dovetailed with a strategy adopted by groups such as the BNP, after Cambridge-educated Nick Griffin took over its leadership in 1999: get sympathisers to contact the media, preferably without revealing their affiliations. And it works.</p> <p> In April this year, I had seen BBC and Guardian Unlimited messageboards flooded with rightwing comments after the airing of England Expects. Few people posting messages openly identified themselves. </p> <p> I had received hate email and death threats myself - a German extremist posted to one messageboard that \"someone should knife this c**t\". Since I first wrote about online extremism in this paper five years ago, right wing and other extremists have become increasingly sophisticated in their use of online media. The scale of the problem has got so bad that international experts met in Paris last month to try and combat the spread of online anti-Semitic, racist and xenophobic propaganda. Haters have found the net a potent tool, spreading fear with such grisly images as the beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2002. </p> <p> France last year banned a website that was home to thousands of daily racist messages, one of which claimed responsibility for dousing mosques with paint in the colours of the French flag. \"Our responsibility is to underline that by its own characteristics - notably, immediacy and anonymity - the internet has seduced the networks of intolerance,\" said French foreign minister Michel Barnier in opening remarks at the two-day Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) conference. France, which is spearheading the effort, has faced a surge in anti- Semitic violence in the last two years. </p> <p> Websites expressing extremist, racist or religious-hate views have shown a huge increase worldwide since the start of this year. Sites promoting hate against Americans, Muslims, Jews, gay people and African-Americans have increased by 26% since last January - almost as much as the 30% rise during the whole of 2003, according to web and mail-filtering firm, SurfControl. </p> <p> Sites offering anything from scholarships to dating services for white supremacists, promoting the murder of homosexual people, offering revisionist versions of September 11 (ironic that neo-Nazis as well as militant Islamists love the idea of a Zionist conspiracy) and other extremist content have grown by about 300% since SurfControl began monitoring the net in 2000. </p> <p> Authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are committed to tackling the problem, with the FBI announcing a crackdown and Len Hynds, head of the UK's National Hi-Tech Crime Unit, calling for a zero-tolerance approach to \"abhorrent websites\". </p> <p> One of the most infamous purveyors of this material has been Don Black. He founded and runs Stormfront, which was set up in 1995. Black has maintained that his Florida-based Stormfront is simply a \"service for white nationalists: we provide information, a discussion forum and we do not advocate illegal violence.\" When I looked at the site the day after the BBC's Secret Agent, there were comments about a BNP member who had helped the undercover team. One talked of the short life this person should expect, before the moderator hastily closed down the thread. </p> <p> Yet the anonymity offered by the internet suits the fantasy world many of these people inhabit. Such fantasists can inflict deadly results, as Sally Kincaid and Steve Johnson found out to their cost. The first they knew something was wrong was when their neighbour came running out of her house shouting that their car was on fire. The two Leeds-based teachers were anti-racists who had been active in campaigns against the BNP. Their names, address and car registration details had been posted onto a neo-Nazi website called Redwatch. It is a form of hitlist for the far right and well-known within those circles, including among many BNP supporters. </p> <p> Anti-racists, leftwingers, campaigners such as comedian Mark Thomas and others have all been targeted. Most worrying, the real agenda behind Redwatch is revealed on a closed membership discussion list, monitored by anti-fascist group Searchlight and nicknamed Mole Intelligence. It states: \"This group will provide those activists with up-to-date information on Red Targets ... now's the time to start a proper campaign of violence and intimidation towards those who seek us silenced.\" </p> <p> The group operates under the auspices of Combat 18, a violent neo-Nazi gang. A growing number of politicians, trades unionists and members of the House of Lords have now called for the people behind Redwatch to be prosecuted. The internationalising nature of the net has assisted many groups, too. Just take a look at the BNP website, for example.</p> <p> It bears a crude similarity to that of the Mouvement National R\u00bfpublicain (MNR). The MNR is an offshoot of France's notorious Front National, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, and to whom almost all European far-right extremists pay homage. However, while the increase in such sites may seem huge, at least part of the rise can be attributed to an overall rise in internet subscribers: in the fourth quarter of 2003, 12.1m UK households could access the internet from home, compared to 2.2m in the same quarter of 1998. </p> <p> \"Back when Stormfront launched, the net seemed to present huge opportunities for propaganda, raising money, selling merchandise in the white supremacist world,\" says Mark Potok, an expert in the extreme right and director of the Intelligence Project, part of the US civil rights organisation, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). </p> <p> Towards the end of the decade, the number of sites began to slow, he explains. They now grow roughly at the same size as internet usage overall. For Potok, hate sites are actually \"brochures\" - much of the real information is swapped behind the scenes in encrypted email or closed membership email lists. Many of these are watched by the SPLC and occasionally exposed: one case involved the revelation that a Confederate heritage group was infiltrated by white supremacists. Shortwave radio is also very popular among white supremacists in the US but \"recruiting happens face-to-face, not electronically,\" argues Potok. </p> <p> However, the advent of MP3 and the online music scene provided a huge boost and reach for white power bands and their backers to a nascent - and rebellious - teenage audience. There have been a whole spate of \"ethnic cleansing\" PC games, too, and much propaganda aimed at converting the potential US college kid. </p> <p> \"You've got to remember, too, that in the 1970s and 80s the average white supremacist was isolated, shaking his fist at the sky in his front room. The net changed that. That person can now wake up, go to their computer and read a huge number of messages, newspaper headlines and a whole array of listings and information from across the country,\" says Potok. Suddenly the fantasists belonged. Many white power fanatics even set themselves up with their own servers, becoming hosts to other sites, as Stormfront has done. </p> <p> Extremists also tend to host their sites in jurisdictions geographically out of reach of the authorities of countries that might want to shut them down. For example, several hundred German neo-Nazi websites, aimed at German-only audiences, are hosted in the US because of the freedom of speech laws. In addition, various offshore and island nations have also provided a haven for extremists wishing to host sites and services beyond the reach of law enforcement. </p> <p> So the task facing those who police the internet is far from easy. Efforts such as those coming out of the Paris and OSCE conferences are the continuation of a long struggle to contain the excesses of the internet. As ever, technology moves faster than law and geography. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Send comments to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@theguardian.com\"> online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.

  "For the past four years, Victor Malarek has immersed himself in the world of pimps, traffickers, rapists and some of the most disenfranchised women and girls in the world. One of Canada's leading investigative journalists, he is the author of a new book about the global sex trade, The Natashas, a harsh introduction into a business that causes uncalculated misery to hundreds of thousands of young women. <p>The title refers to the generic name given by customers to the women and girls trafficked across international borders every year; the US state department currently puts this figure at around 900,000, most of them from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Malarek estimates that trafficking in women generates about $12bn (\u00a36.6bn) a year, making it the third largest money-making venture in the world, after trafficking in weapons and drugs. </p> <p>Malarek's book takes us to auctions in Bosnia, where women are displayed naked on wooden crates to be poked and prodded like livestock. He hears stories of rape, abuse and torture on a shocking scale. But he avoids repeating what counter-trafficking activists already know, and what has been said many times before - that these women deserve our pity and compassion. There have been countless international events set up to address the issue of trafficking, but in Malarek's view the focus has been too much on the women forced into it, and not enough on the traffickers themselves, the perpetrators of the crime; there has been too much hand-wringing, and not enough action and enforcement. \"We have spent millions researching the causes,\" he says, \"and on international talking shops drawing up action plans and new legislation. But unless we implement these laws, and give police more money to investigate and prosecute the pimps, we will get nowhere.\" </p> <p>The Natashas is an angry, impassioned book, for which Malarek makes no apologies. He describes the people who buy and sell women as \"low-life criminals\", \"gutter trash\" and \"heartless goons\". He does not make a distinction between \"forced\" and \"chosen\" prostitution - as many campaigners in the field do - but outlines the human rights abuses evident in the sex industry per se. He also identifies customers as a large part of the problem. \"Let's look at how societies can discourage men from buying these women,\" he says, \"which would reduce the supply. Some people justify prostitution by saying, 'It's the world's oldest profession.' I say there are ways to stop this. Trafficking is an easy crime to solve. If I can find the brothels and traffickers, so can the police. Just look in the tabloid personal advertisements for a start.\" These men are not looking for relationships, he says. \"They want sex with a faceless female. Those who use trafficked women want to pretend that they are not like their sisters, mothers or partners.\" </p> <p>Born in Lachine, Quebec, in 1948, Malarek was taken into care when he was nine, and grew up in a children's home. Before that, he regularly witnessed his father beat his mother in fits of drunken rage. As a teenager, he spent time in juvenile correction centres for petty crimes, but then decided to turn his life around and got a job as a copy boy on a Montreal magazine. </p> <p>A front-page story for the Montreal Star in 1971 about the suicide of three boys in a Canadian correction centre launched him as a serious investigative reporter. He has since become a passionate advocate for the abused and the marginalised, writing books about Canada's immigration policy and drugs trade, as well as hosting a television documentary series, The Fifth Estate. \"As a writer, I have always relied on my gut,\" he says. \"If I feel a story is important, I will go all out to expose it.\" </p> <p>When Malarek began research for The Natashas in 2000, journalists in Canada and elsewhere were by and large uninterested in the subject. \"I would see stories coming in through the wires about the abduction and mass rape of Moldovan, Russian and Bosnian girls, but no one was following them up. I decided it was something I could not ignore,\" he says. </p> <p>Focusing mainly on trafficking from the former Soviet Republic, Malarek examines the role of the Russian mafia, as well as the Albanian, Israeli, Czech, Serbian, Hungarian and Ukrainian gangs involved in international pimping. He reserves his fiercest criticism for those EU countries that have gone some way toward legalising prostitution in the belief that it will alleviate illegal elements within the sex trade. Governments should come down hard on criminals, he says, not improve their working conditions. </p> <p>\"Countries like the Netherlands and Germany [which have legalised 'off-street' prostitution] should hang their heads in shame,\" he says. \"They should walk into the UN building with their flags held at half-mast for what their policies on the sex trade have done to thousands of young women. Traffickers have been given a red carpet to walk on in those countries.\" </p> <p>His no-tolerance stance is not shared by some in the UK. Liverpool city council will seek Home Office approval for a \"managed zone\" for street prostitutes this November, and last month shortlisted two industrial estates as possible sites. The council maintains that a common area for women to work will improve their safety, as well as give them access to health and support networks; it is also popular with residents who do not want prostitution on their doorsteps. But similar zones have been established and subsequently closed down in the Netherlands because of an increase in trafficked women being brought to the area, along with high levels of violence and drug abuse. </p> <p>The Natashas also examines the complicity of some members of the international community based in the Balkans, where trafficking is a growing problem. In 2002, an employment tribunal heard how Kathryn Bolkovac, a UN police officer, had been sacked after revealing that colleagues were involved in the sexual abuse of women and young girls in Bosnia. The American security firm she worked for, DynCorp, was ordered to pay Bolkovac \u00a3110,000 in compensation for unfair dismissal, and three men concerned were fired but never charged. (The UN itself is powerless to prosecute, and it is up to member countries to take further action.) During the employment tribunal, the court heard that one of the men had bought a young girl for $700 and kept her in his apartment for sex. </p> <p>In Bosnia, Malarek met a 15-year-old girl who had been trafficked to Bosnia. \"She was the 21st birthday present for one of a [UN] platoon and was raped in turn by men with American, Canadian, British, Russian and French accents - so many she stopped counting,\" he writes. Malarek describes the traffickers' recruitment methods. An orphanage in Romania might receive a visit from \"social workers\" offering \"apprentice programmes\" for adolescent girls. The girls are taken away and forced into prostitution. </p> <p>Much of Malarek's anger focuses on the annual US state department Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, which grades countries with a trafficking problem according to three tiers. Nations fully compliant with the minimum standards in combatting trafficking are graded tier one, while those unwilling and unable to counter the problem are graded tier three. The UK is in tier one, but there are those who believe - Malarek among them - that the grading system is merely another strategy adopted by the US to reward its allies. </p> <p>\"The TIP report was designed to stop the traffickers operating with impunity,\" he says. \"It was supposed to be about having the courage and vision to take a firm and even bold stand. It was supposed to be about leadership and accountability. But despite all the hoopla and sabre rattling, the US has degraded the process to little more than a diplomatic game.\" </p> <p>Earlier this week, protesters in Bangladesh (graded a tier-three country) argued that the report was a means of pressurising the government into deploying troops in Iraq, and only criminalised the poor. \"Poverty is the main cause of human trafficking and the US should look into it,\" said a spokesperson for the Bangladesh Citizens Alliance Against Trafficking . </p> <p>Despite its TIP status, the UK does not have a strong track record in prosecuting traffickers, with the few cases that are brought being investigated mainly by the Metropolitan police. Even with the new legislation introduced through the Sex Offences Act, which has increased the penalty for human trafficking to a maximum of 14 years, traffickers are scarcely deterred by the force of the law. </p> <p>In December last year, Luan Plakici, an Albanian, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for trafficking up to 60 young women from south-eastern Europe into the UK; he was also convicted on counts of incitement to rape, living on prostitution and kidnap. When the sentence was passed, there were gasps of disbelief from police and anti-trafficking activists at the judge's leniency. </p> <p>The court of appeal later increased the sentence to 24 years. \"Ten years is no deterrent,\" says Malarek. \"Traffickers see it as an occupational hazard to go to jail every now and again. What hurts is when you seize their assets - take everything they have and give it back to the women they've abused and the police so they can track more of them down.\" </p> <p>Does he think the situation has got worse? \"There are no new crimes of this nature; just different ways of getting away with them.\" Malarek accuses the UK, and other countries that have thriving sex industries, of turning a blind eye. \"Tolerance is worse than legalisation in a way. It means we can ignore the fact that some countries provide a safe haven for pimps rather than think of a solution. I would say to the UK, 'Legalise prostitution at your peril'. It would be a red light for pimps to operate with impunity, knowing vice is out of the police's hands.\" </p> <p>The Natashas can seem like a hopeless story, the scale of the problem is so vast. But Malarek is not pessimistic. \"What we need is for governments to say, 'Stop this, and stop it now'. I have a daughter, and would do anything I could to prevent her going into the sex trade. I'm proud of this book, and hope to hell it makes a difference. If it prevents just one life being ruined, then it will have been worth it.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Natashas: The New Global Sex Trade, by Victor Malarek, is published today by Vision, \u00a310.99</p>",
  "Despite arriving sooner than expected and catching much of the American press off guard, the June 28 handover of sovereignty in Iraq was trumpeted as a momentous event. <p>That night CNN devoted its entire prime-time lineup to analysing the brief, 15-minute ceremony in Baghdad. Fox News cheered it as \"a day that will go down in history\". Newspapers the next morning were clogged with reports from Iraq and speculation about what the transfer of political power would mean for the rebuilding of Iraq, as well as for the 140,000 US troops serving there. </p> <p>The handover, though, has done very little to change things for the better in Iraq. In the past six weeks, the country has been gripped in escalating violence, forcing some coalition countries and private contractors to flee for safety. Kidnappings by insurgents have multiplied, as have assassinations, while electricity still remains in short supply. </p> <p>Iraq's national conference - critical to the eventual implementation of free elections - has been postponed, and US soldiers continue to die. </p> <p>\"On June 28, my feeling was nothing was going to change because of the handover,\" says Steven Cook, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"There were still going to be car bombings and US soldiers being killed, and that's exactly what's happened. Nothing has changed.\" </p> <p>But one thing did change: US press coverage of Iraq. The handover marked a turning point in the level and intensity of media interest, which sharply decreased, particularly on the 24-hour cable news channels. </p> <p>\"Clearly the volume in press coverage has gone way down,\" says Cook. \"'Sleepy' is a good word to describe it. The coverage doesn't compare with anything we'd seen during the previous 12 months from Iraq. The drop-off has been noticeable.\" </p> <p>\"From the very beginning this has been an administration that wanted to hide the toll of the war -- and the media have been absolutely complicit in that,\" says Nancy Lessin, co-founder of the antiwar group Military Families Speak Out. Lessin's stepson, a Marine, served in Iraq during the spring of 2003. \"In April of this year, violence in Iraq was up and it was hard to keep the war off the front pages. But as soon as possible the pictures changed. Since June 28, [the war has] been off the front pages again.\" </p> <p>More recently, a week's worth of fierce fighting in Najaf between coalition forces and militant Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army has begun to bring Iraq back into focus. And if US forces unleash a frontal assault there, Iraq will once again dominate the headlines, as it so often has in the past 18 months. </p> <p>\"We're still interested in the story. We're on the air every night about Iraq,\" says Marcy McGinnis, senior vice-president of news at CBS. \"But what's happened is, interest in the political scene has increased. News always ebbs and flows, and at times it may appear Iraq is taking a back seat to politics because that's what's in the news right now.\" </p> <p>Following the ebb-and-flow theory, Iraq is likely to return to the media forefront, however temporarily, when the 1,000th US soldier dies in Iraq. Based on the current fatality rate, that sombre event could happen as soon as late September. Still, considered as a whole from July 1 to the present, coverage of Iraq seems to have diminished. \"It's incredible how the press has veered away from Iraq\" since June 28, says Peter Singer, a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution. </p> <p>Last week \"six US soldiers were killed in 24 hours, and there was nothing. If you're President Bush and you see headlines about Martha Stewart and Laci Peterson, you've got to count yourself lucky, because that means the focus is no longer on Iraq.\" </p> <p>The physical danger reporters face inside Iraq has clearly curbed their efforts to report more. And for editors and producers back in America, trying to find a way to make the repetitive nature of the events in Iraq compelling remains a challenge. \"One can imagine editors saying, 'Gee, we just did a roadside bombing story yesterday,'\" says Singer. \"But that's how an insurgency works; it's the same attack over and over.\" </p> <p>That fatigue among members of the press corps makes it less likely that the daily violence in Iraq will be considered newsworthy. \"I covered the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad in August of 2003, and that was a shock,\" says Ken Dilanian, a staff writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer who has spent several months reporting from Iraq in the past year. </p> <p>\"As I recall, CNN broke into its regular programming live and stayed with it all day. That was with 24 people dead. Nowadays that happens every week, and it's on Page A14.\" Press fatigue \"was bound to set in,\" agrees Cook. \"But it is uncanny how it occurred right after the change in sovereignty on June 28.\" </p> <p>The media's shift away from Iraq is good news for the White House, which has watched American sentiment turn decisively against the war and specifically against President Bush's handling of the ongoing military effort. </p> <p>\"Without question, the Bush administration is better off with no news from Iraq,\" says Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who served in Baghdad as an advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority last spring. Now the administration is much more interested in ushering the war on terror back into the foreground, while shuffling Iraq into the background. </p> <p>\"Terrorism news trumps Iraq news for Bush,\" says Juan Cole, a professor of modern Middle Eastern history at the University of Michigan. The emphasis on terrorism news fits with Bush's poll results. Fifty-two percent of Americans approve of how Bush is handling the war on terror, compared with just 37 approving of his actions in Iraq, according to the latest CBS poll. </p> <p>So far, the White House's choreography is working as planned, particularly on cable TV, which is feasting on fresh terror warnings at home while giving just token attention to Iraq. So are newspapers like the New York Post. On August 7, under the banner headline \"War on Terror,\" the Post spread 11 stories over five pages detailing the \"Crackdown on Qaeda Creeps\". The Post ran just a single article that day about the situation in Iraq. Readers might be getting the impression that Iraq is as irrelevant as Afghanistan has become. </p> <p>Yet the diminished attention to Iraq has created an odd media disconnect. While most pundits agree Iraq will be a key issue in November, Americans are being exposed to less reporting and analysis about the war. \"There's an inverse relationship in press coverage and the situation in Iraq,\" says Cook. \"It's amazing; the press has grown weary of reporting the same story regardless of how important it is. It is the issue in the campaign.\" </p> <p>For example, in the wake of the sovereignty handover, NBC's \"Meet the Press\" discussed Iraq in depth during its July 4 telecast, featuring Senator Joe Lieberman, and Senator John Warner, who spent nearly 20 minutes on the topic. In the five weeks since that broadcast, however, the show has not once matched that degree of focus on Iraq. </p> <p>Instead, when the topic is addressed it's invariably in a domestic political context: How will Iraq affect the US election? What's actually happening in Iraq has much less salience. (On the Aug. 8 broadcast of \"Meet the Press,\" national security advisor Condoleezza Rice was asked 18 questions; only three were about Iraq, and none were related to current events there.) </p> <p>Ironically, after the Democrats' convention in Boston, \"Meet the Press\" host Tim Russert, suggesting it was the Democrats who were not anxious to raise the war issue, asserted that Iraq was \"the 800-pound elephant in the room that people don't want to talk about\". Yet it is \"Meet the Press\" itself, along with much more of the mainstream press, that has become increasingly fascinated with domestic politics and indifferent to the war. </p> <p>The political ramifications of the media's recent sluggishness are significant because, aside from military families, most Americans don't have a direct connection with the war. How the press plays - or downplays - Iraq between now and November \"will have a profound impact on the election,\" says Phil Trounstine, director of the Survey and Policy Research Institute at San Jose State University. \"Less coverage would be good for the president,\" he observes. </p> <p>A recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press suggests a direct link between reporting on Iraq (or how people treat the news from Iraq) and Bush's political fortunes. During the month of June, just 39% of Americans paid very close attention to the news coming out of Iraq, the lowest rate for all of 2004. </p> <p>Over the same period, the survey found, Americans' opinion of Bush, as well as of the situation in Iraq, improved noticeably. On July 14, ABC News' the Note - the online roundup of the day's must-reads for political junkies - theorised: \"The Bush campaign is counting on the continued absence of a drumbeat of bad news out of Iraq to improve right track/wrong track\" polling numbers. </p> <p>Was there really an absence of bad news from Iraq? Nearly three dozen GI's were killed during the first two weeks of July. On that same July 14 day, Iraq erupted in a new wave of violence. A suicide attacker detonated a massive car bomb near the British embassy, killing 11 and wounding 40. </p> <p>An insurgent group, probably led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, announced it had beheaded a Bulgarian hostage. Five Iraqis were killed and 21 insurgents were wounded in fierce fighting in the Iraqi city of Ramadi. </p> <p>Insurgents killed the governor of Mosul as he was driving in a convoy of vehicles. A gunman assassinated the director general of Iraq's Industry Ministry as he left his Baghdad home. Meanwhile, two GI's were killed that day when their vehicle rolled over. </p> <p>Few if any of those deadly incidents on July 14 received sustained cable news coverage in America; instead the congressional vote on same-sex marriage was the preferred topic of the day. </p> <p>The next day, canvassing the media landscape for stories that might affect the November election, the Note made no reference to the carnage in Iraq. Since June 28, that has often been the case with the Note, which perhaps better than any other site accurately captures the shifting moods and priorities of Washington's political press corps. </p> <p>For instance, on July 22, the Note linked to 116 separate stories, drawn from 23 quasi-political categories (9/11 commission, national security, the economy, same-sex marriage, etc.). Not one of them had to do with events in Iraq. </p> <p>And that was just 24 hours after an audacious bombing by insurgents of a Baghdad police station, a deadly attack that was completely overshadowed on cable news outlets by the story that former national security advisor Sandy Berger had been under investigation - for nearly six months - for breaching protocol at the National Archives while reviewing documents in preparation for the 9/11 commission hearings. </p> <p>Television wasn't alone in downplaying the police station bombing story. While the Washington Times and the Washington Post both put the attack on Page 1, scores of major-market dailies, including the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Arizona Republic, Denver Post, Hartford Courant, Indianapolis Star, New York Times and San Jose Mercury News, kept the story off the front page. </p> <p>A recent check of the Note on Aug. 2 indicated more of the same: 83 story links in 15 categories, none of them dealing with Iraq. Yet voters are told by the press that come November, the issue of Iraq may very well decide the election. After June 28, the line about there being \"no bad news\" from Iraq even seeped into reported pieces. On July 21, the New York Times, in a campaign trail dispatch, noted that one key factor that may work in Bush's favour in November is that \"in Iraq, the transfer of sovereignty has led to some reduction in American casualties.\" </p> <p>But, in fact, nearly as many US soldiers lost their lives in Iraq during the first half of July alone as did during the entire month of June. Of the 15 months since major combat ended, July ranks as the fourth deadliest for US soldiers serving in Iraq. And if August's current fatality rate continues, it will easily claim more American lives than July did. </p> <p>So why does the press act as if the handover of sovereignty has changed the situation on the ground? \"It seems the mainstream press has bought in to the White House line about June 28 - 'OK, we're in a new phase,'\" says Lessin of Military Families Speak Out. </p> <p>\"But we still have 138,000 troops there and are occupying a country. It hasn't changed. If it has changed, it's increased the violence in many areas. Then again, the press has [always] been in the lap of the administration, and once again it's playing its role of lapdog.\" </p> <p>CBS News executive McGinnis denies that charge. \"We have 22 minutes [on the \"CBS Evening News\"] and we pick and choose the stories each night. We make subjective editorial choices every single day, and we're not making them on how to help or hurt George Bush or John Kerry. The decisions [about Iraq] are based on what's happening in Iraq that day.\" </p> <p>Of course, major news organisations are still covering Iraq and spending extraordinary resources - both human and financial - to keep Americans informed. The major dailies, as well as the nightly network news broadcasts, still dutifully report the developments in Iraq. On August 6, for instance, USA Today ran a long Page 1 account about new fighting in Iraq, while \"NBC Nightly News\" opened its broadcast with a similar report. </p> <p>But since the hand-over in Iraq, a certain intensity, or urgency, has been missing from the coverage - a reluctance to go beyond the day's random bombings, kidnappings and shootings. </p> <p>To be sure, the 24-hour cable shows are the news outlets that have ratcheted down their Iraq reporting the most over the past six weeks. That became glaringly obvious during the Democratic national convention in Boston, where many pundits and producers spent much of the time ignoring the politics and bemoaning how little actual news there was to report. </p> <p>Yet here's a small sampling of what happened in Iraq that same week, little of which was deemed newsworthy enough to seriously interrupt the endless, repetitive cable TV discussion about swing voters and Teresa Heinz Kerry's \"shove it\" remark: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> July 26: Attackers shot and killed Iraq's senior interior ministry official and two of his bodyguards in a drive-by shooting. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 26: A suicide bomber detonated a car filled with explosives, mortars and rockets near the gates of a US base in Mosul, killing three. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 27: The dead body of a kidnapped Turkish truck driver was found. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 27: One Iraqi was killed and 14 coalition soldiers were injured when a mortar hit a Baghdad residential district. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 28: A car bomb exploded on a busy boulevard in Baquba, killing 68 people and wounding nearly 100. The attack stood as the deadliest insurgent strike since the US occupation began last year. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 28: Seven Iraqi soldiers and 35 insurgents were killed during a firefight in Suwariyah. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 29: Reeling from the violence and a wave of kidnappings, Iraqi officials once again postponed a three-day national conference to choose an interim assembly in preparation for the country's first elections. </p> <p>Experts say that week was typical of the chaos that has transpired in Iraq this summer, with or without the spotlight of the US press shining on the region. \"Iraq remains very much in the balance. That's the only fair assessment you can make right now,\" says Brookings' Singer. \"I've talked to friends who served in the CPA, and I don't know anybody with on-the-ground experience in Iraq who doesn't think the situation there isn't completely screwed up,\" adds Cook. </p> <p>\"Iraqis are so embittered and [have] completely lost any faith in us, even the most pro-American Iraqis,\" says the Philadelphia Inquirer's Dilanian, who says he has had a profound change of heart on the topic. </p> <p>Last April, fresh from reporting in Iraq, an optimistic Dilanian wrote that the press was ignoring improvements in Iraq and underplaying the chance for a real turnaround. In late June he returned to Baghdad to cover the sovereignty handover. </p> <p>Summing up his new grim impressions in an August 1 article, Dilanian admitted his earlier prediction was wrong and wrote, \"The situation in Iraq right now is not as bad as the news media are portraying it to be. It's worse. Most Iraqis aren't seeing the improvements they had hoped for, and they're not blaming the guerrillas - they're blaming the Americans. Sovereignty seems to have had zero effect on this equation.\" </p> <p>That's the key story many American news outlets have missed since June 28. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Eric Boehlert is a senior writer at Salon.</p> <p>This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited. \u00a9 Salon.com 2004 <br> Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">www.salon.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Britons are not spending more time watching TV, surfing the internet and talking on their mobile phones - they are doing all three simultaneously and becoming increasingly inattentive to television.</p> <p>Research experts at the Henley Centre say television is becoming a wallpaper medium - on in the background - and viewers are not giving their full concentration to it as they did in the 1970s, 80s and early 90s, when families would gather round the box to watch shows such as The Generation Game, Blue Peter or even the news.</p> <p>Figures released by Ofcom yesterday - which show that consumption of all media had risen and that our obsession with the internet had not reduced the amount of time we spend watching TV - hide underlying changes in the way we consume media, says the Henley Centre.</p> <p>According to Ofcom, UK households last year spent more time watching television, more hours listening to the radio, nearly five times as long surfing on the internet and sent 15 times as many text messages than we did four years ago - despite working an average of 1731 hours a year.</p> <p>But instead of spending time exclusively devoted to watching Coronation Street, searching the internet, listening to the radio or texting, we have become so media literate that we are increasingly combining activities - and in some cases doing all at the same time. </p> <p>\"What we are seeing is that people are consuming media more intensively, watching the TV with the radio on in the background or surfing the internet and glancing at the TV,\" said the Henley Centre's director, Andrew Curry.</p> <p>\"We are not necessarily spending more time doing it, just that more media is competing for our attention.</p> <p>\"The danger is that as television and radio become increasingly ambient - on more as background and not in the front of our minds - people will eventually say why should we bother with it at all.\" </p> <p>But the Ofcom figures, however they are interpreted, are bound to fuel the current obesity debate, adding to accusations that we are becoming a nation of couch potatoes whose main activity is pressing buttons on remote controls and mobile phones while consuming vast amounts of junk food.</p> <p>\"A lot of the data around suggests that families are spending less time sitting down to eat together and using that time instead to consume media,\" says Mr Curry.</p> <p>Health professionals and anti-obesity groups point to a \"ticking time bomb\" of obesity that will soon overtake heart disease as the biggest killer in Britain.</p> <p>Sir John Krebs, the outgoing chairman of the Food Standards Agency, last year warned that life expectancy could start to fall if the government fails to head off the growing threat of childhood obesity. </p> <p>\"What we are faced with is a situation where, if nothing is done to stop the trend, for the first time in a hundred years life expectancy will actually go down.\" </p> <p>While there are no comparative figures for the four-year period covering the amount of time people spend taking exercise, the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics suggest most adults spend just 13 minutes a day undertaking physical exercise.</p> <p>According to a recent EU survey into the lifestyles of 15 European countries, Britain was only the sixth most active nation. Over 60% of UK citizens are considered to have a sedentary lifestyle characterised by how little of their leisure time is spent doing physical exercise.</p> <p>The UK is the third-hardest working nation in the world after the US and Japan, yet we are finding more time to watch TV, talk on the phone and surf the internet according to the survey.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "From the moment Michael Howard announced his plans to free the police from excessive paperwork, you knew someone was going to say it. Someone always says it. <p>This time, it fell to the Channel 4 News team, who said it in their daily email to viewers, though at least they had the good grace to phrase it as a question. Was the current state of police bureaucracy, they wondered, a case of \"political correctness gone mad?\" </p> <p>If you believe what you read in the papers, political correctness goes mad with alarming regularity. In the last month alone, for example, it went mad twice in the Midlands, according to the Birmingham Evening Mail - once when a vicar demanded that a pub called the Saracen's Head be renamed to avoid offending Muslims, and once when Ofcom banned a radio ad for faggots. </p> <p>The phrase cropped up again in Scotland, when Aberdeen council decided to spare the blushes of school pupils by withholding poor sports scores from the media. It also showed up in response to a proposed law banning hotels from refusing to accommodate gay couples. </p> <p>And finally, as if to cement its reputation as the hardest-working cliche in the news business, it made a cameo appearance in a story about Hertfordshire council stopping children from wearing goggles in its swimming pools for fear of injury. According to one local mother quoted in the Evening Standard, the goggles policy was a clear-cut case of - well, you know the rest.</p> <p>How to explain political correctness 's inexorable descent into madness? The trouble seems to have begun in 1992, when the New York Times reported on a hiring row at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology the fateful phrase is attributed to the philosopher Christina Hoff Sommers. </p> <p>By 1993, veteran Tory MP Terry Dicks was deploying it against those offended by the verb \"to welsh\". Since then, it has appeared at least 631 times in British national newspapers. \"Political correctness gone mad\" has gone mad.</p> <p>Since the concept of PC is mainly rightwing doublespeak anyway, you can make some reliable predictions about those instances where it is held to have gone mad. </p> <p>First, the level of outrage will be out of all proportion with the allegedly mad policy, which will either be perfectly sensible or, at worst, a bit oversensitive to other people's feelings - hardly a war crime. </p> <p>Second, the story will be more complex than it appears (in the Ofcom faggots case, the ad made a deliberate joke of the word's homophobic connotation). </p> <p>Third, the \"slippery slope\" argument may be used, with some furious everyman complaining that, now you're no longer allowed to hurl racist abuse in the street, it can only be a matter of time before they ban breathing. </p> <p>All in all, it's time for a moratorium on \"political correctness gone mad\". Actually, perhaps we should ban it.</p>",
  "<p><strong> We're here to help ourselves</strong><br> </p> <p>Existence is a pricey privilege and, as techno wizards conjure up ever more complex methods for easing life's path, it's getting pricier. So it doesn't help when, on top of sending out scary bills, companies persecute us for money we don't owe. Banks, of course, are best at squeezing the last pence out of us by concealing sneaky little charges among their small print - and, as Nick Berish of Manchester has found, inventing fees out of thin air. He recently used BT's Click and Buy internet service to renew a \u00a330 newspaper subscription which he paid for by Mastercard. To his astonishment, he discovered that NatWest had treated this simple transaction as a cash advance and helped itself to a handling charge plus interest. He contacted Click and Buy, which told him that it had received several similar complaints and that NatWest was refusing to communicate with BT about the issue. Berish then called NatWest, which passed him back to BT. </p> <p>Berish went back to his paperwork to check the fine print and established that a \"cash advance\" is a method by which a customer uses a bank card to obtain cash, foreign currency or travellers' cheques and a \"purchase\" is when the card is used to purchase goods or services. \"There's no question that my transaction was a purchase, unless they are inventing a completely new concept of cash borrowing,\" he says. \"It seems NatWest is flagrantly breaching its own contractual terms to misappropriate customers' money.\" </p> <p><strong> Berish is too cynical. Greed was not at the root of this lucrative little scheme - instead it was \"a temporary error with our process ing platform\", although strangely it required the involvement of NatWest's press office for the bank to become aware of this. According to a spokeswoman, a small minority of customers were affected and the bank has been striving to identify them (why, I wonder, were they so uninterested when Berish rang to identify himself?).</strong> </p> <p><strong> Anyway, his decision to go public has reaped rewards. NatWest has refunded the handling charge and erroneous interest and added a \u00a350 bonus to cheer him up. I wonder if Mr and Mrs Bloggs who try to seek redress through the usual channels will be so indulged. </strong> </p> <p><strong> On the subject of bank charges, I recently wrote of the loading fee levied by all banks on overseas credit transactions. Thanks to all of you who wrote in to point out that Nationwide makes no such charge. There are advantages to remaining mutual!</strong> </p> <p><strong> They can't be bargained with, they can't be reasoned with</strong><br> </p> <p>Debt collection agencies are the national experts in exhorting money, be it justified or not, and once one of these predators is on your scent it's almost impossible to shake them off without digging deeply into your pockets. Sarah Hasell of Grantham faces a court appearance and an \u00a380 legal fee over a bill she paid months ago. It started when she moved house in January and telephoned her electricity supplier, Powergen, to settle her final \u00a391 bill. Powergen agreed to collect the money in two direct debits, but forgot to do so and sent her a reminder for the first instalment two months later. She settled the amount over the phone and was assured that the second payment would automatically be deducted from her account. Sadly it suffered another attack of amnesia and in May it sold her \"debt\" to the debt collection agency Wescot, which set about hounding her for the money. </p> <p>Hasell promptly rang Powergen, paid the outstanding sum over the phone, and asked it to inform Wescot. Since then, however, she has received increasingly threatening letters from the agency, which refuses to believe that the bill has been paid, and is now told that she is to be taken to court. </p> <p><strong> Affectingly, Powergen blames itself and is tearful with contrition. It admits that it failed to call Wescot off once the payments had been made and is now investigating its own laxity. Hasell is to receive profuse apologies and compensation and Wescot has now been hauled back into its cage.</strong> </p> <p><strong> The power to charge what they like</strong><br> </p> <p>Shopkeeper Mohan Kumuran of Clevedon in Somerset is being pursued for \u00a33,000 worth of electricity supplied by Scottish Power over three years before he bought his premises. North Somerset Council have battled on his behalf but Scottish Power is unmoved and has dismissed confirmation from the council and Kumuran's neighbours that he only took over the shop at the end of last year. Worse, it is continuing to send him bills even though he pays for his electricity with a top-up card at his local Spar and has receipts for all his transactions. Scottish Power, which does not seem to have billed the previous owner for three years nor to have any idea who those owners were, is now threatening Kumuran with bailiffs. </p> <p><strong> We're used to small miracles on Consumer, and here's another one. Scottish Power has ignored months of letters from Kumuran's assiduous local councillor but contacts him within minutes of hearing from the Guardian. It turns out that the problem was a simple one. Both Kumuran and his predecessor had been paying their bills with a SWEB keycard instead of a Scottish Power one all these years. Quite why SWEB didn't twig that it was receiving funds that it wasn't entitled to or why Scottish Power took so long to realise that it was out of pocket is unclear. But the happy outcome is that SWEB has passed the money on to Scottish Power, which has now cleared Kumaran's account and will be sending him the correct key card for future use.</strong> </p> <p><strong> The right trousers</strong><br> </p> <p>Amazingly, there are still some companies who give out more than they are paid for in the name of good customer service. When Jennifer White of Southwell, Nottinghamshire, broke her leg, she needed some trousers wide enough to accommodate her splint. She identified a likely pair via the mail-order firm the White Company, discussed her needs with a \"charming and helpful\" operator, and received the package a few days later. Included in the parcel was a luxury travel bag of toiletries with a personal note wishing her a speedy recovery.</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>At the end of row J, 20-year-old Nina from Australia removes her bra and reveals her naked breasts. The large audience stares and claps. She volunteered, and her boyfriend Seth is standing next to her, but she's been bullied by the maestro into getting down to the flesh. She won't let him remove her trousers, but Seth - perhaps to spare her blushes - removes his own and reveals his pierced penis to the world. </p> <p>We're about two-thirds of the way through XXX, a brutally explicit Catalan adaptation of De Sade's Philosophy of the Bedroom, which for the past week has been laying down two direct challenges to Edinburgh audiences. First: will you volunteer to show your breasts and/or genitalia to everyone here? Second: why not? </p> <p>I am sitting on my own in the middle of the front row, on a mission. Twenty minutes ago, the leader of the show, a muscularly terrifying De Sade, made me his first choice. \"Can we see your cock?\" he asked, through a deadpan interpreter. OK, I said, assuming (as I'd often been told) that it was all done with sleight of hand and cunning prostheses. I am here to participate, after all. He took me by the hand and led me on to the huge stage. I got a round of applause. </p> <p>\"May I?\" he asked, red-varnished fingertips poised at my fly. OK, I said again, intrigued as to where this prosthesis - this stunt cock - was going to come from. In one swift movement, he unbuttoned and whipped down my jeans and shorts. I got another round of applause. </p> <p>It was an odd moment. Naked from the waist down, I looked around the crowd. There must have been about 300 people staring at me. But this I couldn't believe: there, about six rows up, was my dad. I know he arrived in Edinburgh yesterday to see some shows. I gave him a wave, but he says he didn't recognise me. </p> <p>\"Can you make it hard for us?\" asked De Sade, pointing at my cock. No, I need the loo, I said. This got a laugh, but it was quite true; I'd been holding it in for the past half-hour. \"Well you can piss here,\" De Sade said, motioning hospitably across the rubber floor. (And he meant it. I can see that he really meant it.) No, I said. That's your lot. </p> <p>De Sade then set about the audience to find a woman. I was still on stage, and I pulled my trousers back up. I felt proud of myself for going through with it, but an anxious question lingered: what did they have planned? The original request had been for single men and women, and I am in a serious relationship. I called over De Sade's sidekick and told him that I would stop immediately if they tried to make me do anything with someone else. With great kindness, he told me not to worry. And he was right. After the most desultory of fully clothed cuddles with two other volunteers, I toddled gratefully back to my seat. The other man, whom I took for a stooge, went rather further - and he, I noted, did have a rubber member. </p> <p>Like all participatory theatre, XXX is a challenge to its audience. And like all challenges, it is difficult to face. When XXX appeared in London last year, it triggered a predictable volley of yawns. Such exploitative gimmickry could never shock me or turn me on, said the critics. I bet it did both. </p> <p>At the beginning of the evening, I thought the prospect of exposing myself was frightening and somehow significant. Safely reinstalled in my seat, I realised that it wasn't important. Just 22 hours earlier, I had been standing in the crowd at the excellent Karaoke Show, terrified by the innocuous prospect of singing on stage. </p> <p>Karaoke is a very loose interpretation of A Comedy of Errors as a series of pop classics sung by the dysfunctional habitu\u00e9s of a camp nightclub. Years ago, I had been to The Donkey Show (the same company's take on A Midsummer Night's Dream) and been persuaded to climb up on a platform and spank one of the dancers with a table-tennis bat. It is an evening that my friends and I still remember with delight - but then, none of us had to sing. </p> <p>I had done karaoke in public once before, drunk, in a run-down south-London pub where no one listens much. As I remembered it, I'd had a little trouble with the tune on that occasion, so this time I chose Eminem's Without Me - a near-noteless classic that I know well. It was a fatal error. </p> <p>The trouble with rap is that it's even harder to do than proper singing. There are a lot of words, and they clatter past at quite a lick. To my horror, I was called first. I remembered to hold the mic in the correct gangsta manner (stem above, bulb below), and I tried to keep moving on stage, but, without being word-perfect, I found it hard to keep up - particularly since the teleprompter was broken, and many of the lyrics were illegible. Sympathetic bursts of applause greeted each string of swear words I managed to get right. There was a lot of spit, and I remember laughing all the time. I finished with a deep hip-hop \"Yiih!\" and left the stage, glad it was over. </p> <p>I was followed, to my great relief, by Maggie, a singing teacher, who did a better Whitney Houston than Whitney Houston and rescued me from the prospect of a Queen's Hall semi-final. Among the other contestants, a special mention should go to \"Big Alan\", the drunken Scotsman who chose the Troggs' Wild Thing. It is a simple tune, more pause than song, which suited his fish-eyed incomprehension perfectly. I felt we sang the same language, Alan and I. </p> <p>The Karaoke Show had been a joyous experience, but the following afternoon, three hours before my date with De Sade, it was topped by the ultimate family frolic: Mimirichi. It is hard to know what to expect from a troupe of Ukrainian paper clowns. Were it not for my professional interest, I would have steered clear, like most sensible people, of anything in which clowns were involved. How lucky that I didn't. </p> <p>With no words, and nothing but some basic props and a lot of paper, four men made a cavernous ex-cinema feel like a playground. With just the simplest physical language, they found a way to overleap logic and build an absurd world that makes a brand new kind of sense. It was like being sucked into a cartoon. </p> <p>Having forgotten my spectacles, I escaped that stunt. (No details: it's better enjoyed cold.) But there was no avoiding the great paper fight. One clown offered me the first piece. I reached - and he snatched it away. Reached again - snatched again. And then ... well, then it got messy. </p> <p>There is an extra-special kind of laugh, the kind that rings out from the heated core of party games and food-fights, which is an unthinking response to pure, innocent abandonment. This kind of laugh one only gets from joining in, and I was exhausted from it after 75 minutes of Mimirichi. Just enough energy remained to raise myself for a raucous standing ovation - the only one I've seen so far this year. </p> <p>This is if you don't count [PS04] A Paint Show, a dark and totally involving experience, in which there are no seats. There is no stage, either - there is a backstage, but audience and actors occupy the same performance area: a large indoor tent. Everyone must strip and don white boiler suits before entering. The 24-year-old director, Andrew Boch, who has developed the project through four incarnations over the past three years, admits an open debt to club culture: raucous dance music supplies the background, while glowing things, bouncy things and sticky things make up the body of the entertainment. </p> <p>Coloured tribes form from the paint-spattered mass. Then cast members encourage dances, games and even fights among the audience, communicating the rules with nothing but physical gestures and non-human grunts. I saw people lose it in there.

  "<p>Steven Spielberg's much-awaited film about the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympic hostage drama is to be delayed while the script undergoes a complete rewrite, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>The film, which has attracted a great deal of attention due to interest in how Spielberg will deal with the sensitive subject matter of Israeli-Palestinian tensions, has not yet begun shooting.</p> <p>Screenwriter Tony Kushner has been brought in to work on the new draft. He's the man behind the critically-acclaimed HBO mini-series Angels in America.</p> <p>The film was originally to be called Vengeance, but reports suggest the title is once again up for grabs. Eric Bana, star of Hulk and Chopper, is still on board to play the lead role.</p> <p>The Hollywood Reporter says Spielberg will turn to his adaptation of HG Wells's early science fiction classic The War of the Worlds while the rewrite takes place. Tom Cruise is set to star, to reunite the successful team behind Minority Report.</p> <p>All this means Cruise will have to delay shooting Mission: Impossible 3 as Hollywood plays its traditional game of movie dominoes.</p>",
  "<p>The culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, said today that the rapist who won a \u00a37m lottery payout should be stopped from receiving his prize.</p> <p>Ms Jowell, who has responsibility for the Lotto, said it was right for the government to intervene in such \"a very specific case\".</p> <p>She refused to say whether new laws being introduced to stop serving prisoners receiving prizes should be made retrospective to cover cases like that of Iorworth Hoare.</p> <p>But she added: \"I don't think that Mr Hoare should receive these lottery winnings.\"</p> <p>Mr Hoare is 15 years into a life sentence after being convicted of attempted rape in 1989. He was also jailed for a string of sex attacks during the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>He bought the ticket that won him a share of the \u00a321m Lotto Extra jackpot while on temporary release from a Middlesbrough bail hostel on Saturday.</p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, has indicated that new laws currently before parliament will stop a serving prisoner or their family from benefiting from any win.

  "<p>Legend of Zelda, Pac-Man (NES Classic Series)<br> GBA, \u00a314.99 Nintendo, <br> ***** </p> <p> You could never accuse Nintendo of not milking every drop of its back catalogue. The latest wheeze, designed for the summer holidays, is the release of some \"classic\" games from the 80s. Originally realised on Nintendo's NES system, these relics are proof that not everything retro is cool. </p> <p>The range includes the best-forgotten Xevious and Ice Climber. If you are curious to see what games were like when Duran Duran were huge, then try Pac-Man and the Legend of Zelda instead. The former needs no introduction and is an excellent conversion of what remains a uniquely addictive munch-em-up. The main problem is that you can get perfectly adequate phone versions of Pac-Man substantially cheaper. Unless you have the urge to play on the bigger screen of a Game Boy Advance, it makes sense to go mobile. </p> <p>More relevant is The Legend of Zelda, the first in the venerable series and a far more interesting proposition. It is testament to the original design that this is still highly playable and uses a template that subsequent Zelda games have built on. Players guide elfin adventurer Link around a massive world, as he fights monsters, solves puzzles and rescues the Princess. Progression is drip fed by item retrieval, as previously unreachable destinations - such as islands or mountains - become accessible with newly found objects. Despite the raw graphics, Legend of Zelda is worthy of the title \"classic\". <br> <strong> Greg Howson</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2</strong><br> PC, \u00a334.99 1c/Codemasters, <br> **** </p> <p> First of all, a warning: Soldiers is hard. No, I don't mean challenging, I mean 60 minutes spent trying to get past the first 60 seconds of the first level - which puts paid to the game's loftier claims of realism. </p> <p>Undoubtedly, liberating Europe in the mid 40s was hard but storming the German frontlines using only one tank and a Jeep (as you have to do in the very first mission) is so unrealistic you get the feeling the developers are cheating on their own rule book. Of course, you play it at Novice level, but no one likes owning up to incompetence, do they? </p> <p>Which is a pity, because in other respects Soldiers takes wargaming to new levels of complexity and detail. With 30 large missions, split across German, Russian and Allied campaigns, everything you might expect from a quality RTS is here minus the resources. Most of the buildings can be occupied, all of them destroyed, and you have hundreds of authentic weapons and units to do it with. </p> <p>You also get a choice of playing modes, allowing you to use standard RTS mouselicks or press the spacebar to take direct control of any unit, moving while firing to negotiate some of the trickier sections. </p> <p>This (and the attention to detail) creates unique situations and challenges - for instance, searching for a petrol container under heavy fire so you can refuel a sitting duck tank - all unknown territory to wargamers. </p> <p>So, although Soldiers is not a perfect game, most of its problems could be solved by a patch, and what's left is another impressive Codemasters assault on yet another new genre. <br> <strong> Mike Anderiesz</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow</strong><br> Xbox, \u00a319.99 Ubi Soft,<br> **** </p> <p> Last year, team-based shooter Rainbow Six 3 was the poster boy of Xbox Live, its exhilarating multiplayer online mode making foamy-mouthed anti-terrorist nutters of us all. Unfortunately, the single-player experience was dull, and bugs did their best to sabotage the online fun. So while we're waiting for RS4, this generously proportioned, standalone update fixes all the minor RS3 grievances and adds some excellent new features. </p> <p>For the lone player, there are 10 new missions, built around a zeitgeisty terror plot involving war among oil-rich Black Sea states. It's the usual mix of tense corridor roaming and huge set-piece shoot-outs, with you commanding three AI troops as you move through industrial silos and crumbling back streets. </p> <p>As with previous Rainbow Six titles, the door opening mechanism dominates the action: should you just open it, or perhaps throw in a flash grenade, or - oh, what the hell - lob an explosive charge in, too? </p> <p>The enemy AI is slightly improved, and there's a split-screen, two-player mode for those who want cooperative thrills without the inconvenience of having broadband installed. </p> <p>But Rainbow Six 3 is really about multiplayer, and this must-try element has been re-balanced and re-tuned to near-perfection. New maps, new weapons and new Xbox Live 3.0 features (including lots of well-thought-out clan functionality) make Black Arrow an essential. </p> <p>In short, if you haven't navigated a downtown ambush with a 32-year-old Texan covering your back, and a teenage sniper from Calais scouting ahead, you haven't experienced online gaming. <br> Keith Stuart</p>",
  "<p>Stewart Lee has attained guru status on the stand-up scene. He's supremely at ease on stage, and his ribbing of lazier peers (\"Do you remember Spangles? Do you? Do you?\") draws attention to the comedy class divide. In his new set, there are several inspired riffs. But Lee's technical excellence is driving him in directions I sometimes find easier to admire than enjoy. </p> <p>It's about timing. On one hand, Lee's opening routine is brilliant: an extended piece about how, after 9/11, he salved the world's wounds with farting. But he tells it slowly, wilfully testing the audience's patience. Likewise later, with an interminable riff about the director Ang Lee's name. I appreciated his technical control, while longing for the joke to end. </p> <p>Sometimes, his audience-baiting is more subtle - and the better for it. Claiming to be \"Scotch\" himself, he proves William Wallace was gay and that Scotland \"was invented in 1905 by McGowan sweet company as a way of marketing Highland toffee\". His best material is his most animated - particularly, an extrapolation of Jimmy Hill's claim that the words \"chinny\" and \"nigger\" are equally offensive.

  "Appe al court judges yesterday defied human rights campaigners by ruling that British courts could use evidence extracted under torture, as long as British agents were not complicit in the abuse. <p>In a highly controversial judgment, the second highest court in the land rejected the appeals of 10 men suspected of having links to international terrorism and currently held without charge in what activists call \"Britain's Guant\u00e1namo Bay\". </p> <p>The court of appeal, sitting in London, ruled that the home secretary was right to hold the men in two high- security prisons and a high- security psychiatric hospital, and that the special immigration appeal commission (Siac), which backed the internments, was justified in doing so. </p> <p>Two of the men have since returned to their countries of origin but are still appealing. </p> <p>The judgment was immediately condemned as leaving the door open for torture evidence to be used in British courts - and the detainees plan to take their appeal to the House of Lords. </p> <p>Last night Amnesty International criticised the judges for giving a \"green light for torture\". It said: \"The rule of law and human rights have become casualties of the measures taken in the aftermath of September 11. This judgment is an aberration, morally and legally.\" </p> <p>The decision comes just a week after three British men formerly held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay described how after ill treatment they had confessed to meeting up with Osama bin Laden when in fact all three had alibis, confirmed by British security services, that they were in the UK at the time. </p> <p>Ellie Smith, a human rights lawyer at the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said: \"It is really dangerous and very worrying that any court is willing to use any evidence that has been obtained through use of torture or ill treatment.\" </p> <p>The decision to allow evidence from foreign torture was tantamount to contracting out the torture. \"We have seen recent instances where the US forces have sent people to other countries for the purpose of extracting evidence,\" she added. </p> <p>The men - all of them foreign nationals and Muslim - are detained indefinitely under the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 and do not know most of the evidence against them because it is kept secret in the interests of national security. </p> <p>In their appeals, they argued that to use evidence obtained by torture was \"morally repugnant\", adding that evidence may have been extracted from men detained in both Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Yesterday, one of the judges, Lord Justice Laws, ruled that there was no evidence to suggest the secretary of state had relied on material derived from torture or any other violation of the European convention on human rights. To suggest that it had been was \"purely hypothetical\". He and Lord Justice Pill said that torture evidence could be used in a British court so long as the state had not itself \"procured\" it or \"connived\" at it. </p> <p>The position facing the secretary of state on the use of such evidence was \"extremely problematic\". The law could not expect the secretary of state to inquire into the methods of how information was obtained. </p> <p>Mr Justice Laws said: \"He [the home secretary] may be presented with information of great potential importance, where there is, let us say, a suspicion as to the means by which, in another jurisdiction, it has been obtained? What is he to do?\" </p> <p>The judges unanimously dismissed the appeal but Lord Justice Neuberger dissented on the torture issue. He said he did not consider that a person would have a fair trial if evidence obtained through maltreatment was to be used, particularly since the person giving the statement would not be available for cross-examination. </p> <p>The majority decision was welcomed by the home secretary, David Blunkett. He said: \"There has been a great deal of speculation about the cases put before Siac and whether they relied upon torture. Let me make it clear, we unreservedly condemn the use of torture and have worked hard with our international partners to eradicate this practice. However, it would be irresponsible not to take appropriate account of any information that could help protect national security and public safety.\" </p> <p>Gareth Peirce, solicitor for eight of the men, said: \"This is a terrifying judgment. It shows we have completely lost our way in this country, morally and legally.\" </p> <p>Britain is a signatory to the European convention on human rights which enshrines a series of fundamental rights, including \"freedom from torture, inhuman and degrading treatment\". </p> <p>Facilitating torture elsewhere is also illegal under the convention against torture to which the UK is committed. </p> <p>The lawyer for two other men, Natalia Garcia, said that human rights had become \"a casualty of the so-called war on terror\". She added: \"We have sunk to an all-time low where a court can even contemplate that evidence obtained under torture could be admissible and where there is no attempt to provide any effective remedy against abuse of power. </p> <p>\"This is injustice heaped upon injustice and we shall appeal to the House of Lords.\" </p>",
  "The ramifications of yesterday's ruling in the appeal court that evidence obtained by torture should be admissible in the UK are awesome. We have warned before of the way in which Britain's \"Guant\u00e1namo Bay\" law erodes the most fundamental principles of the nation's criminal justice system. Under the 2001 Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act, rushed through parliament following the al-Qaida attack on the US, foreign suspects can be detained indefinitely without charge or trial. Yesterday's verdict goes much further, by eroding fundamental principles of international law. <p>The case before the court was an appeal by 10 foreign nationals detained under the act more than two years ago. Their lawyers were attempting to overturn the decision by the commission set up to hear appeals, which upheld the government's decision to detain them. Lawyers for the detainees argued they should never have been held because some of the evidence on which the Home Secretary had acted had been obtained by the US holding other detainees under conditions of torture. The court rejected this claim, with Lord Justice Laws declaring: \"It is plain to my satisfaction that there was no evidence in any of the appeals that any material relied on by the secretary of state had in fact been obtained by torture.\" </p> <p>But the court did not stop there. It went on to examine if it would be permissible in principle for the commission to look at evidence extracted by torture. Strip away the fine gradations of interpretation that are woven into most judgments from the second highest court in the land, and what is left is a 2-1 majority decision that evidence produced by torture would be admissible in such cases as long as Britain had not \"procured or connived\" at the torture. </p> <p>Gareth Peirce, solicitor for the detainees, was right to describe this decision as \"terrifying\". She was not exaggerating when she declared that it showed \"we have completely lost our way in this country legally and morally\". This is a decision that totally ignores a succession of international treaty obligations, one of which, the European Convention on Human Rights, the UK was instrumental in drafting. Do not be confused by Britain's decision to opt out of this convention in order to implement the 2001 act. In terms of torture, there is no opt-out. All that opting out allowed was the decision to detain foreign terrorist suspects without charge or trial. </p> <p>The judgment breaches both the UN convention against torture and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. True, there is no international court to which the UK can be taken with the new judge-made British law. True, even if there was, the UK could argue that, although we have signed the UN convention, we have not incorporated it. But we have incorporated the European convention. What is shocking is to see two of the highest judges in the land ready to ignore these international conventions. International law depends on the mutual respect of member states as a means of enforcement. None of the other 44 states that have incorporated the European convention on human rights has introduced detention without charge or trial, let alone allowed evidence generated by torture. Similarly, none of the 150 states of the UN convention has publicly taken such a position. </p> <p>The judgment must not be allowed to stand. This can be achieved in at least three ways. One is to appeal against it to the House of Lords on the grounds set out by Lord Justice Neuberger, the dissenting appeal court judge. Another is for parliament to refuse to extend this section of the act when it comes up for renewal in 2006. But there is a third way: ministers could simply reverse out of their human rights cul de sac by declaring that we will not be a legal pariah.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday I phoned our local cinema to book some tickets for The Stepford Wives, a film in which women are ruthlessly replaced by robots. The phone was answered by a computer with a female voice, which failed to understand a word I said. As a roboticist and AI researcher I'm often asked how close we are to achieving the level of artificial intelligence portrayed in The Stepford Wives, I, Robot, or some other film. But what can I say? It doesn't work like that. </p> <p>The invention of the wheel wasn't presaged by months of headlines saying \"Axle breakthrough imminent\" or \"Round is better than square, say scientists\". One moment the idea hadn't occurred to anyone and the next it had. AI is much the same, except the right idea still eludes us. AI is to natural intelligence what alchemy was to chemistry: we're valiantly mixing things together to see what happens, but we lack the right conceptual framework; we have no periodic table. If it hadn't been for alchemists there would be no chemistry, so I mean no slur. It's simply that the problem is incredibly difficult. </p> <p>The sad thing is that people really do believe what they see in the movies, and this suggests they badly underestimate their own intelligence. Anyone who thinks they could be replaced by a jumped-up laptop needs help with their self-image. </p> <p>It's our very intelligence that prevents us from seeing the scale of the challenge: by the time we become aware of the world our brains have already solved most of the problems. To see the task from a robot's perspective we need to imagine trying to build our own Stepford wife. Let's skip the advanced stuff, like holding rational conversations, and start with a simple task like baking a decent cup-cake. In fact, that's unbelievably hard. How about a robot that can pick up a wooden spoon? It's a start. </p> <p>First our android needs to recognise the spoon. Spoons come in many shapes and sizes, and look radically different depending on the angle you view them from. Without storing an image of every kind of spoon seen from every possible angle, scale and position, how can we get a robot to recognise it? And how will the robot realise that the spoon is a discrete entity in the first place, and not part of a spoonbowlcakemixturetable object? Until robots can do this they'll be utterly useless around the kitchen, never mind taking over the planet. </p> <p>Suppose we crack this problem. The robot's next task is to pick up the spoon. No technology can yet match animal muscle for strength, speed, smoothness, weight and efficiency. But that's the easy bit - many people are already working on smart materials that will one day provide a substitute. Muscles aren't in fact the problem. Control is the problem. </p> <p>Look at it this way: suppose we made a robot arm and hand with 22 degrees of freedom (a shoulder joint has three degrees of freedom: forwards, sideways and rotate). This is less than a human arm but good enough to manipulate a spoon. Suppose each joint can be rotated to 10 angles, and we program the arm to move to a new position every second. How long do you think it would take the robot to go through all the possible arrangements? An hour? A week? The answer is 315,000,000,000,000 years - 20,000 times longer than the universe has existed. </p> <p>Forget computers. We know of only one machine that can solve the problems involved in picking up a spoon, and that's the brain. The snag is that we don't have a clue how it works. We know a lot of details, but we don't understand its operating principles. Until we do, you can forget all about androids. </p> <p>I actually have a Stepford Child. Her name is Lucy, and together we are trying to answer this question. Despite having one of the most complex artificial brains yet devised, all she's so far learned is how to recognise bananas and point to them. Big deal. But as I say, such \"trivial\" things hold the key to understanding intelligence, and Lucy may actually be hinting at a new paradigm. It's about time we owned up to being alchemists and attempted more big, bold ideas like this. The rigorous, incremental stage comes later, once the wheel has been invented. Unfortunately, British universities don't seem designed to permit such rash eccentricity. In my case I work independently of academia, which frees me from such conservatism but also leaves me with almost no sources of funding. You can't win. In fact, funding problems mean that Lucy's banana-pointing days may be over. But that's another story. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Growing up with Lucy: How to Build an Android in Twenty Easy Steps, by Steve Grand, is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.

And this is a man who knows what he's talking about. As Tory home secretary, Mr Howard cut crime by a million offences a year ... Now Mr Howard offers his services again as our crimebusting champion. The Tories, he vows, would build more prisons and keep more murderers, rapists and thugs in jail rather than give them early release ... </p> <p>\"He would demand tougher sentences from judges, let heads decide on expelling yobs rather than meddling social workers, and allow fair-minded cops to question people on the streets without having to fill in endless forms. He also calls for zero tolerance toward the legions of louts who swagger around our towns terrorising law-abiding folk ... A relentless war on criminals is what Britain is crying out for.\" </p> <p><b>Daily Mirror</b><br> Editorial, August 11 </p> <p>\"Mr Howard's speech ... was a jarring reminder of the bad old days of Tory government ... It was a return to the same old scapegoats: single mothers, ethnic minorities and those on low incomes. </p> <p>\"[He] says he wants people to take responsibility for their actions. Well, perhaps he should take responsibility for his own. Wasn't it his party that presided over the slide of our inner cities into a miserable, neglected hell? Wasn't Mr Howard the home secretary who cut the number of Britain's police officers by more than 1,000? ... That the Tories are willing to sweep aside findings from the Macpherson report shows they learned nothing from the tragic death of Stephen Lawrence. And it shows the depths to which they are willing to sink.\" </p> <p><b>Daily Telegraph</b><br> Editorial, August 11 </p> <p>\"Home affairs ought to be the Tories' high ground, and it is high time that they reclaimed law and order from Labour ... Mr Howard has thoughtful things to say about the causes of crime ... decline of respect and personal responsibility, fathers absent or denied access, parents penalised for disciplining their children, headteachers who are unable to expel disruptive or violent pupils ... </p> <p>\"He rightly rejects the Macpherson recommendation that police keep absurdly detailed records of every person they stop. Mr Howard knows that what is holding the police back is not institutional racism, but institutional political correctness.\" </p> <p><b>Independent</b><br> Editorial, August 11 </p> <p>\"The 1999 Macpherson report recommended that the police record their reasons for stopping (and not just searching) people, so they are forced to address their disproportionate targeting of black people. Mr Howard is in effect advocating a return to an era when the police could harass ethnic minorities with impunity. </p> <p>\"The Tory leader also took the opportunity to air his antediluvian views on the prison service. He is still of the opinion that cramming ever more people into our jails 'works'. His solution to the chronic shortage of space in Britain's prisons is to build more of them. He neglected to say where the money would come from, given that his party is committed to freezing the Home Office budget. He also failed to explain the rationale. If Mr Howard wants to cut re-offending rates he should commit the Tories to increasing investment in re-education and employment programmes ... </p> <p>\"His proposals to strengthen the powers of headteachers to expel disruptive children are not thought out. Removing the external appeals panel in such cases would open the door to lawsuits against schools.\" </p> <p><b>Times</b><br> Editorial, August 11 </p> <p>\"[Mr Howard's] pledge ... that a Conservative government would not proceed with an outstanding recommendation of the Macpherson report, namely that all those stopped ... must have a written explanation and receipt handed to them, is ... sensible ... </p> <p>\"Although the term 'stop and search' is often used as if it were two parts of one activity, there is, at present, a major distinction recognised in legislation. If a police officer stops an individual or group, requesting an account of behaviour or presence, but doesn't proceed further, no record is required ... If a search is initiated, by contrast, the officer is then obliged to explain why this occurred, the outcome, and the self-defined ethnic status of the person being investigated ... Much of policing consists of what might be termed the 'soft stop': non-confrontational questions, often of a very general kind, that enable the police to impress their authority on a troubled neighbourhood and also acquire a sense of whether problems might be looming ... </p> <p>\"The present distinction is an appropriate one ... This is reinforced by practical considerations ... [The additional paperwork created by the change] could act as a disincentive to officers contemplating whether to take the trouble to stop.\" </p> <p><b>Daily Express</b><br> Editorial, August 11 </p> <p>\"In wanting to cut police paperwork, Mr Howard has hit the nail on the head. Our police should be fighting crime, not red tape. But when there is so much police bureaucracy to choose from, he should not have picked on the forms that police fill out when they stop someone. The procedure is time-consuming but is something that many police welcome since it protects them from accusations of racism and inaccuracy.\"</p>",
  "Saving the planet is no simple matter. After a year and a half of talks, the Department of Trade and Industry has announced a further three months consultation on two key European Commission directives on the disposal and recycling of electronic goods, and admitted that it will miss the deadline for translating the directives into UK law. However, it insists it will put the laws into effect by August 2005, as laid down by the commission. <p>The directives, known as WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) and RoHS (Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic equipment), are fundamental to reducing the mountain of IT products that end up in landfill, many releasing poisonous waste into the earth. Most problematic is the question of old cathode ray tube monitors that can contain up to 2kg of lead. </p> <p>Despite a growing recycling industry, huge numbers of PCs and related kit end up in landfill each year. The WEEE directive pushes responsibility back on producers and distributors to help dispose of, re-use and recycle old equipment. Producers will have to take responsibility for collecting an equivalent of the amount they sell each year - like-for-like collection. </p> <p>The UK versions of the directives have been delayed over fundamental details. Central to the debate is the concept of a National Clearing House (NCH) - a non-profit organisation to monitor producers. Some industry experts say the idea unnerved the IT industry because it was suggested that it would require them to supply the NCH with data on sales. That data is commercially sensitive. </p> <p>Other sticking points concern the creation of dedicated collection points, the responsibility of smaller businesses, the responsibility of retailers and the calculation of producer responsibility. </p> <p>Mike Dinsdale, marketing director of printer firm Brother UK, says the delay has caused some consternation: \"I get the feeling that the government doesn't have the same confidence in the idea of an NCH as it did before. With the deadline now so tight, firms like ours are already making arrangements with recycling firms to ensure we are ready.\" Dinsdale also questions why the consultation looks at impact on small firms when this wasn't considered before. </p> <p>\"We all accept that we cannot keep sending products to landfill and that we will have to bear costs, but we are dismayed that we are not closer to the final legislation by now.\" </p> <p>Claire Snow, a director of Icer (Industry Council for Electronic Equipment Recycling), which has been at the centre of the consultation, says that it is now a matter of interested parties focusing on areas where a consensus can be reached. \"It's been a very complex process with so many interest groups; it's still very unclear what the role of retailers will be, and how the government will differentiate between consumer waste and commercial waste.\" She says that business-to-business WEEE waste may be as high as 2m tonnes a year - twice the consumer volume. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, environmental groups remain concerned. Claire Wilton, senior waste campaigner at Friends of the Earth, says the key aim of the directive must not be forgotten: \"This is all about ensuring producer responsibility. It is not acceptable for businesses to wriggle out of this. What we have learned is that consumers want to recycle things but you have to make it easy for them to do so.\" </p> <p>Others are concerned that the delay is damaging investment in the recycling industry. John Pettifer, managing director of Recycling IT (Europe), says it is affecting his ability to grow his business. \"We are about to move into premises 10 times the size, to cope with the huge volume of IT kit we are handling, but we don't know what kind of licences we need to take on more processing.\" He believes the government is also making a fundamental error in giving more funds to local amenity waste sites when they will still not have the capacity to process it. \"They should focus more funding on processing sites. We are spending \u00a3750,000 on new processing equipment.\" </p> <p>Though most vendors declined to comment on their environmental policies until the consultation is complete, many already have procedures in place. For example, Canon UK says it started collecting toner cartridges in 1990 and has so far collected a total of 81,000 tonnes worldwide. It says it also has procedures to ensure that products collected from customers are either re-used or recycled. </p> <p>The new directives will ultimately decide who must pay for recycling, re-use and disposal. It remains to be seen if prices of electronic and electrical goods will rise as a result.</p>",
  "<p>Last month, the case against Patrizia Reggiani was reopened in Italy. She is serving a 26-year jail sentence for having ordered the killing of her husband, the fashion supremo Maurizio Gucci. At the first trial in 1998, expert witnesses dismissed her lawyers' claims that surgery for a brain tumour had changed her personality. The new trial has been granted because her lawyers believe that brain imaging techniques developed since then will reveal damage that was previously undetectable, and strengthen their case for an acquittal. </p> <p>The idea that someone should not be punished if their abnormal neural make-up leaves them no choice but to break the law is contentious but not new. However, one prominent neuroscientist has sparked a storm by picking it up and turning it round. Writing in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, one of Germany's leading newspapers, Wolf Singer argued that crime itself should be taken as evidence of brain abnormality, even if no abnormality can be found, and criminals treated as incapable of having acted otherwise. </p> <p>His claims have brought howls of outrage from academics across the sciences and humanities. But Singer counters that the idea is nothing but a natural extension of the thesis that free will is an illusion - a theory that he feels is supported by decades of work in neuroscience. </p> <p>The head of the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt, Singer is best known for his work on the so-called binding problem of perception. This is the conundrum of how we perceive an object as an integrated whole, when we know that the brain processes the various elements of it - colours, angles, and so on - separately. His group was among the first to suggest, and then demonstrate, that the answer lay in the synchronisation encoding the separate features. He has since extrapolated those ideas to the process by which we make decisions, which has led him to question whether we are really the free-acting agents we imagine ourselves to be. </p> <p>His argument goes like this. Neurobiology tells us that there is no centre in the brain where actions are planned and decisions made. Decisions emerge from a collection of dynamic systems that run in parallel and are underpinned by nerve cells that talk to each other - the brain. If you look back in evolution to say, the sea slug Aplysia, you see that the building blocks of this brain have not changed. The amino acids, the nerve cells, the signalling pathways and largely the genes, are the same. \"It's the same material [in humans], just more complex,\" says Singer. \"So the same rules must govern what humans do. Unavoidable conclusion.\" </p> <p>He argues that the human brain has to be complex to compute all the myriad variables that influence each decision we make - genetic factors, socially learned factors, momentary triggers including commands and wishes, to name a few. And because it considers most of those variables at a subconscious level, we are not aware of all the factors that make us behave in a certain way, just as we are not aware of all the elements of an object that are processed separately by our visual brains. As humans, however, we are able to extract some of those factors and make them the focus of attention; that is, render them conscious. And with our behaviour, as with the world we see, we yearn to build a coherent picture. So we might justify our decisions in ways that have nothing to do with our real, subconscious motivations. </p> <p>The most striking example of this is hypnotism. Singer himself learned how to hypnotise while a student at Cambridge University. At a party, he instructed a Royal Air Force pilot to remove the bulb from a light fitting and place it in a flowerpot, on hearing the word Germany. The pilot did so in mid-conversation, much to the amusement of the onlookers. They were amateurs, they didn't debrief him properly. And when they told him what he had done, because he had no recollection of doing it, he was extremely disturbed. </p> <p>According to Singer, what the pilot did is explained by the structure of his brain and its inherent weakness, if you see it as a weakness to be susceptible to hypnotism. The same goes for a murderer or a thief, he says. We live in a society where people whose behaviour is considered to deviate from the norm - as determined arbitrarily by that society - answer to the justice system. But the way they are treated by that system is, he believes, inconsistent. </p> <p>If some abnormality is found in a person's brain, the doctor's report is submitted as mitigating evidence and the defendant may be treated more leniently. If nothing is discovered, they are not. Take the case of the British man who terrorised 200 officials because he thought they intended to have him sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Psychiatrists found no sign of a mitigating mental illness, and he was jailed for life. But, says Singer, if a person does something antisocial, the reason for it is in the brain. The underlying cause may be a twist in a gene, or a tiny hormonal imbalance that cannot be detected with current technology. \"It could have multiple reasons,\" he says. \"But these reasons must all manifest themselves in brain architecture.\" </p> <p>In practice, he says, the change in thinking he advocates wouldn't change the way we treat criminals all that much. People considered a danger to society should be kept away from society, re-educated as far as possible and in cases where this is not possible, simply kept away, as they already are. But he would like to see the courts place less burden on psychiatrists, who are not capable of identifying all the subtle structural changes that lead individuals to behave as they do. \"As long as we can't identify all the causes, which we cannot and will probably never be able to do, we should grant that for everybody there is a neurobiological reason for being abnormal,\" he says. </p> <p>He does not argue that a criminal should not be held responsible for their crime. After all, if a person is not responsible for their own brain, who is? Neither does he argue that we should do away with concepts of good and evil. \"We judge our fellow men as either conforming to our rules or breaking them,\" he says. \"We need to continue to assign values to our behaviour, because there is no other way to organise society.\" However, he does argue that when people commit crimes, they are not acting independently of the nerve cells and amino acids that make up their brains, and that behave according to certain deterministic principles. </p> <p>One important implication of his argument is that treatment meted out to offenders should be less about revenge and punishment, and more about assessing their risk of re-offending, given the brain they have. Of course, this already happens. If a woman has been driven to a crime of passion after severe provocation, having otherwise lived an exemplary life, she is considered less of a danger to society than a man who has frequently abducted teenage girls, raped and murdered them. Another corollary of Singer's ideas that he recognises will be harder for people to swallow, is that the consequences of a crime should be considered less important than they are, since an individual can only control his own actions and not those of others. For example, a driver seen running a red light should be treated the same way whether or not he hit the child who, unseen from the wheel, stepped into the road at the same moment. </p> <p>\"Breathtaking,\" is how Ted Honderich, a philosopher at University College London, scathingly describes Singer's foray into traditional philosophical territory. Honderich says philosophers have discussed different definitions of freedom for centuries, one of which is perfectly compatible with the sort of determinism Singer describes. That is, if free action is defined as action caused by your character - whatever hereditary and environmental influences contributed to that character - then you are free even if your brain does resemble that of a slug. </p> <p>And although the discussion might appear to have degenerated into a slanging match between scientists and philosophers, neuroscientists have also criticised Singer. \"We don't know enough to make such conclusions,\" says Cornelius Weiller, an expert in brain imaging at Hamburg University. Singer is right, he says, that there is no homunculus in the brain, making our decisions for us. But the question remains, how do all those parallel computations become integrated, and how does the self feel that \"I\" made the decision? Science has yet to answer the binding problem of decision-making. </p> <p>In response to the accusation that he is rehashing old ideas, Singer points out that the German newspaper debate got under way without him, and he was merely responding. So the more interesting question, perhaps, is why the public is interested again now. One reason, he thinks, is that people look at their societies, see that the totalitarian ones failed, and realise that the most complex are self-organising and impossible to steer or control. \"You free yourself from authorities, including the gods, but you find yourself part of an evolving system,\" he says. \"Now you realise that you don't really have influence on the dynamics of the systems in which you are. I think this gives a feeling of helplessness.\" </p> <p><strong>Further reading</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Keiner kann anders, als er ist, by Wolf Singer, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, January 8 2004 (in German only; his original essay) </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> How Free Are You?

  "Michael Howard has raised the stakes in his race with the government for headlines praising toughness on crime (Howard turns clock back, August 11). But Martin Kettle (Comment, August 10) rightly warns of the impact on the civil legal aid budget of the clampdown on crime. It is time for the prime minister to take the heat out of this debate and return to his promise to be tough not just on crime but on the causes of crime. <p>Simply creating new offences will not achieve that, but the increasing cost of criminal legal aid will squeeze the civil legal aid budget (so reducing access to justice) and further disadvantage those whose lives are most affected by criminal activity. The government has launched a review of legal aid. We hope this will be used to find ways to mobilise the whole of the justice system to help tackle the causes of crime in the most vulnerable communities.<br> <b>Janet Paraskeva</b><br> Chief executive, Law Society  We are pleased Martin Kettle has injected some balance into the reporting of legal-aid issues and pointed out that the creation of more criminal and asylum offences, not asylum seekers themselves, causes a drain on legal aid funding. An example of this is the latest legislation under which an asylum seeker can be prosecuted if the immigration service believes s/he has destroyed their papers. Given that, for many fleeing war zones and persecution, stopping to apply for a passport is not a priority, we would not be surprised if prosecutions arising out of such cases resulted in more claims on legal aid. </p> <p>The growing complexity of asylum law also creates the demand. It is now virtually impossible for an asylum seeker to conduct their claim without a lawyer. In addition, the poor quality of decision-making in immigration cases in the first instance results in many more applicant appeals. <br> <b>Tauhid Pasha</b><br> Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants  With crime at its lowest level for 20 years, the last thing that we need is to build new prisons or to scrap electronic tagging. If politicians are serious about cutting crime and making communities safer, they should be basing policy on evidence about what works. Instead of locking yet more people up we need investment in measures to prevent children getting into trouble, expansion of mediation schemes which can resolve neighbourhood disputes, better treatment for offenders with mental-health problems and greater availability of drug treatment both inside and outside of the criminal justice system.  <b>Joe Levenson</b><br> Rethinking Crime and Punishment</p>",
  "After a string of teething problems the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain will reopen next week, but visitors will no longer be able to paddle in the water - and a leading designer has warned it could be closed permanently within months. <p>The water is expected to be turned back on again today, but it will be another week before anyone can dip their hands and feet into it, and no one will be allowed to walk in it when it reopens tomorrow week. </p> <p>Royal Parks staff will also control the number of people who can enter a temporarily fenced off area around the feature, and guidelines for the use of the fountain will be posted. </p> <p>But a former head of architecture at the Arts Council of Great Britain, who designed Birmingham's award-winning Victoria Square Fountain, criticised the plans and said the fountain was likely to be closed permanently. </p> <p>Rory Coonan, the brains behind Nesta (National Endowment for Science, Technology and Arts), described the fountain in Hyde Park, central London, as \"inherently unsafe.\" He said: \"The problem with the Diana design is that its dangers are not apparent to the user. Supervision of children is difficult because the structure is too expansive.\" </p> <p>Mr Coonan said the latest changes were \"bolt-on\" measures: \"They are an attempt to put sticking plaster on a poor design. Such measures are seldom effective.\" He said the Department for Culture, which promoted the project, should have the courage to admit it made a huge blunder. </p> <p>The memorial was shut on July 22 after three people slipped and hurt themselves. That came after a series of closures caused by a blocked pump, and flooding when leaves blocked drains after stormy weather </p> <p>Under the new guidelines, drawn up with the help of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, people will be asked not to walk or run in the water. But they will be allowed to paddle their feet and dip their hands while sitting on the sides of the \u00a33.6m feature. </p> <p>The fountain was designed by the American architect Kathryn Gustafson as a tribute to Diana, nearly seven years after her death in a car crash in Paris. </p> <p>Thousands have flocked to the fountain, which was officially opened by the Queen on July 6 amid a blaze of publicity. </p> <p>Greg McErlean, the head of major projects for the Royal Parks and responsible for coordinating the report, said the problems stemmed from overcrowding and people taking their interaction with the fountain too far. </p> <p>Health and safety experts were called in, with design and construction teams, and the fountain water was switched off on July 22 while the investigation, resulting in today's new guidelines, was carried out.</p>",
  "Prisoners who win the lottery or become financially better off could lose some of their money to compensate the victims of their crimes under legislation proposed by the home secretary, David Blunkett. <p>In the wake of the \u00a37m national lottery win by the rapist Iorworth Hoare, Mr Blunkett said that a consultation paper published earlier this year had outlined plans for the government to recover compensation if an offender won the lottery. </p> <p>It also said that every convicted criminal would pay into a victims' fund if their financial circumstances changed for the better. </p> <p>\"This is not a kneejerk reaction to what has happened. Caring for - and compensating - victims of crime is already at the heart of Home Office work,\" he said. \"I will be talking to the Lottery Commission and cabinet colleagues to see if we can stop this happening again. </p> <p>\"And I want to find out if a substantial slice of winnings like these can go into the victims' fund,\" he writes in today's Sun. </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"This proposal was widely backed and the government is now taking this forward in the domestic violence, crime and victims bill currently before parliament.\" </p> <p>Prison reformers said yesterday that Home Office fears of a tabloid backlash might have prompted the decision to move Hoare from an open regime to a high-security category B prison. </p> <p>Hoare, who was given a life sentence in 1989 for raping a retired schoolteacher after serving four separate jail terms for indecent assault and attempted rape, was spending weekends at a bail hostel in Middlesbrough. </p> <p>He is due to be considered for parole shortly. </p> <p>Leyhill, the category D jail in Gloucestershire where he spent weekdays before his transfer, is an open prison designed to help long-term prisoners prepare for release. </p> <p>The 52-year-old was described as a menace to women by the judge who sentenced him 15 years ago, Mr Justice Rougier. \"Every moment you are at liberty some woman is at risk,\" the judge told him. </p> <p>Hoare is reported to have boasted to a fellow inmate at Leyhill that he was \"sound for the rest of my life\" with the proceeds of his win. </p> <p>The Prison Service declined to say in which category B jail Hoare is being held. A spokesman said the decision to move him followed a \"very rigorous\" risk assessment. \"If someone comes into \u00a37m, you automatically look at it again. If we didn't follow procedure and he decided to disappear, someone might lose their job.\" </p> <p>But Simon Creighton, a solicitor who specialises in prison law and has defended a number of high-profile criminals, said that unless Hoare feared for his safety, returning him to a category B jail amounted to a gross overreaction. </p> <p>\"Coming into money like this would help facilitate his release,\" he said. \"It would be so counterproductive for him to abscond.\" </p> <p>Long-serving prisoners who were released straight from a category B jail \"found it very hard to adapt to life outside\", Mr Creighton added. </p> <p>Enver Solomon of the Prison Reform Trust said Hoare had broken no rules by buying a lottery ticket. \"He was given the toughest punishment available. He is being targeted by people who think prisoners remain lesser beings.\" </p> <p>An inmate at Leyhill said Hoare was \"a timid man who was frequently bullied\", but there is no suggestion he was in danger. </p> <p>His brother, Rhys Owen, said he hoped the winnings would enable him to \"sort himself out\". \"What my brother did was inexcusable. But he won the lottery and good luck to him ... Hopefully it will keep him on the straight and narrow.\" </p> <p>Criminal law experts say his victims may decide to sue Hoare for a share of his winnings. </p> <p>Julie Bindel, a campaigner on violence against women, said Hoare should donate his winnings to rape crisis charities.</p>",

The games take place in a natural stadium inside the crater of a huge volcano. Birds and mammals, insects, fish and reptiles battle it out in a virtual, computer-generated manner. Salmon compete against bushbabies and fleas in the high jump, sailfish swim against penguins. When an eagle makes a successful lift in the weightlifting, his fans in the stands do a Mexican wave.

A shame, because otherwise it's a joy. </p> <p> <strong> My Breasts Are Too Big</strong> was this week's example of Channel 4 trying to discredit one of its own serious documentaries by giving it a title that appears to have been torn out of a tabloid newspaper. </p> <p>This one will have had a lot of disappointed Sunday Sport readers tuning in - disappointed because it wasn't a revealing profile of Jordan, but a sensitive and intelligent film about the physical and psychological problems faced by women with very large breasts. </p> <p>I'm not sure we needed to see Rebecca's operation in quite such graphic detail - her breasts were sliced open, peeled back and tissue was carved out then dumped unceremoniously in a bucket for weighing to see if the right amount had been removed. I couldn't actually watch at this point. I wonder what those poor old Sunday Sport readers were thinking - they'd tuned in for Channel Phwoar, and got Channel Gore instead. </p> <p>There was more gore on Four immediately afterwards, with <strong> Nip/Tuck</strong> (Channel 4), the dark comedy about a two Miami cosmetic surgeons and their practice, finally making a landing on terrestrial TV. In the opening sequence Dr Troy slices open someone's bottom and slips in ass implants (quite big over there, apparently - blame J-Lo). Luckily Dr McNamara comes in and notices they've gone in upside down. </p> <p>\"You saved my ass again,\" says Troy. </p> <p>\"And hers,\" the nurse chuckles. </p> <p>It's great - a bit like Six Feet Under, though less subtle, and the people aren't dead, just unconscious. If you're squeamish like me, you'll have to watch a lot of it through the cracks between your fingers, but you'll most likely be laughing at the same time. </p> <p>Finally, oh God, Gordon's back. In <strong> Hell's Kitchen: School Reunion</strong> (ITV1) two of Ramsay's \"celebrity\" chefs go back to his old school in Stratford-upon-Avon to cook for 250 children. </p> <p>It isn't a resounding success; one girl says the pasta tastes like washing up, and a boy thought the whole thing was disgusting. \"I think this meal had a weird combination of food,\" he said. \"Mushy peas, string, lime juice, bony meat.\" But Ramsay declares the whole thing a triumph. </p> <p>As a programme it felt like a dish of leftovers from the last show. Now please, Gordon, go away and leave us in peace for a while.</p>",
  "<p>Rupert Murdoch last night gave strong backing to the strategy laid out by his son James at BSkyB, following the mauling given to his plans by shareholders last week. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch moved to silence his son's critics as News Corporation, which controls the British satellite television business, reported full year profits of $1.65bn (\u00a3896m), up from $1.05bn a year earlier. It was its third consecutive year of double-digit growth. </p> <p>BSkyB shares fell 114p to 488p last Wednesday after James Murdoch announced proposals for growth through a substantial rise in investment. </p> <p>Without referring to his son by name, Mr Murdoch said that management at BSkyB had \"developed the right plan\". </p> <p>\"Our agenda,\" he added, \"and the chief executive's agenda is to return [BSkyB] to being a strong growth company rather than just a cash cow.\" </p> <p>Mr Murdoch also scotched speculation that News Corp might be interested in increasing control of BSkyB. \"Frankly we haven't considered it.\" </p> <p>News Corp reported fourth quarter profits of $399m up from $370m a year earlier. </p> <p>The cable networks business was a big driver of growth. Operating income rose 40% at the rightwing Fox News Channel as it held on to its lead as the US's most watched news channel. </p> <p>The newspaper division, which includes the Sun and the Times in Britain, reported 14% higher profits as advertising returned. The British papers though suffered a \"slight\" decline in the quarter due to higher marketing spending and the cost of launching the tabloid Times. For the full year, the UK newspaper division improved profits by 30%, primarily from circulation growth.</p>",
  "The drama of Richard Nixon's resignation 30 years ago this month has long overshadowed his political achievement. Nixon's criminal White House seemed an aberrant episode rooted in only his pathologies. But Nixon was the father of the modern Republican party. <p>It was Nixon who created a brand-new coalition of Southern conservatism in reaction to the civil rights movement. He absorbed the Dixiecrat followers of George C Wallace - urban ethnic Catholics and white-collar suburbanites fearful of racial turmoil and the breakdown of law and order and resentful of student protests, assertive women and the loosening of social mores; and he shifted the locus of power in the Republican party from the north-east and midwest to California, the south-west and Florida. Nixon's natural cynicism allowed him to juggle the volatile elements that gelled for Ronald Reagan. </p> <p>By the time of Nixon's election in 1968, the Democratic coalition had cracked up under the stress of race and Vietnam. Now the Republican party that came to power is exhausted. It has lost political impetus. Its instability, contradictions and anachronisms have been apparent for more than a decade, since Clinton's victory in 1992. </p> <p>George Bush did not make a new coalition or offer a refreshed Republicanism, despite the trope of \"compassionate conservatism\". He came to power as a result only of a flawed Democratic strategy in 2000, and even then he lost the popular majority and had to rely upon a skewed supreme court to install him in office. Before 9/11, after only nine months, his presidency was winding down, and he lost the Senate with the defection of a Republican. The war on terror was a substitute for old Republican anti-communism, the ultimate glue holding disparate elements together. Still, the party is coming unstuck, disintegrating in its historic base. </p> <p>California, the home state of Nixon and Reagan, has disappeared from the Republican coalition. Its demographic transformations, especially the ever expanding Hispanic electorate (two-to-one Democratic), postindustrial economy and social liberalism, make it a forerunner of the future. Bush is so far behind in California that there is no campaign there whatsoever. </p> <p>To win elections in general, Bush must raise his percentage of Hispanic votes from 35% in 2000 to close to 40%. But, according to a recent Democracy Corps poll, he is five points below his 2000 level and seven down in the south-west and Florida. </p> <p>In Illinois, a former presidential bellwether, the Republican party has fallen off the map. In his famous 1960 victory, Kennedy won the state, with 65% in Chicago. The Chicago suburbs, two-to-one Republican as recently as 1988, have now begun to tilt Democratic (just as have the suburbs of Los Angeles). Meanwhile, the state Republican party has imploded: unable to find a credible Senate candidate against the star of the Democratic convention, Barack Obama, it has now come up with its own African-American, Alan Keyes. A screeching religious right fanatic, Keyes, who has worn a lapel pin featuring the feet of a foetus, is Jerry Falwell as played by Little Richard. Obama is beating him 67-28, undoubtedly Keyes's peak. </p> <p>The turn in Michigan is, if anything, even more distressing for Republicans. West Michigan, home to Nixon's successor Gerald Ford and even today unrepresented by any Democrats in Congress, has John Kerry 12 points above Bush in a poll taken by a local TV station. This collapse is a consequence largely of the desertion of moderate Republicans repulsed by Bush's reckless economic mismanagement and neoconservative foreign policy. These moderates are overwhelmingly mainline Protestants, also offended by Bush's evangelical culture war and faith-based efforts to break down the wall of separation between church and state. </p> <p>The party that Nixon built is crumbling. Bush is the candidate of canned talking points and a party whose instincts have become rote and often counterproductive. The \"war president\" wraps himself in the flag, but the latest code-orange terrorist alert aroused no rally-round-the-flag syndrome; instead, it raised questions about Bush's timing and handling. Rather than campaign on his record, he has challenged Kerry to justify his vote for the Iraq war resolution, and when Kerry explained his reasoning accused him of \"nuance\". How can Bush change the subject? </p> <p>With independent voters bleeding away from him, he has taken to stumping with the maverick Republican senator John McCain, his mortal enemy. Can Bush dump Cheney without being seen as desperate and repudiating his entire term? Bush's father owed his political career to Nixon's patronage; now the son is in danger of inheriting the wind. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Spyware catch</strong><br> I was about to upset my teenage daughters by doing what I thought was helpful: using Ad-aware 6.0 to quarantine the 1,663 things it found. Then I got a message from KaZaA saying all was lost, I must reload it or pay $29.95 to get an ad-free version. Shouldn't there have been a warning writ large of the gaffe I was about to make?  <strong> Tony Hillier</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Jack Schofield replies: </strong> Malware removers usually do warn you that programs may stop working if you remove files, but perhaps not prominently enough. However, the Quarantine feature in Ad-aware 6.0 means you can restore things you have removed. The real problem is that people seem to be increasingly reluctant to pay for software, even though it is expensive to develop commercially. Suppliers have to make money somehow, and therefore resort to bundling advertising programs (which may be spyware) with their free versions. KaZaA Lite was one response: an illegally hacked version of KaZaA with the ad-ware stripped out. But if you are not inclined to pay, I'd suggest persuading your daughters to switch to a file-sharing program that does not include spyware, such as <a href=\"http://www.winmx.com\">WinMX</a>. <a href=\"http://www.shareaza.com\">Shareaza P2P</a> is also worth a look, as it is open source and supports multiple file-sharing networks: EDonkey2000, BitTorrent, Gnutella and Gnutella2 (G2), but not KaZaA's FastTrack. <a href=\"http://www.slsknet.org\">Soulseek</a> is another ad-free, spyware-free file-sharing program, where you can donate $5 for 30 days of \"download privileges\" - your download requests go to the top of the queue. </p> <p><strong> Read or not?</strong><br> Is there any way of ascertaining that the email I have sent has reached its destination?  <strong> G Divecha </strong> </p> <p><strong> JS:</strong> Most email programs allow you to request a receipt to say that a message has been read. In Outlook Express, for example, create a new message, go to the Tools menu, and tick the option for Request Read Receipt. You can also make this the default option. In Outlook Express, select Tools|Options, click the Receipts tab, and tick \"Request a read receipt for all sent messages\". However, the recipient can ignore your request and not send one. With important emails, I check that it has been sent by sending a \"blind carbon copy\" (BCC) to a Yahoo! mailbox. This also provides a useful backup. </p> <p><strong> Permanent wave</strong><br> My computer crashed to the extent that I had to reinstall Windows 98 to get it running again. Shortly after that, the display on my monitor does not fill the screen, and is wavy along the edges.

However, it might also be that Windows has automatically selected monitor settings that are too high. Right-click on the desktop, select Properties, click the Settings tab, and then click the Advanced button. Click on the Adapter tab and look for the screen refresh rate. The presentation may vary, and you may have to click a List All Modes button, but there should be several options. Now select a slower one: for example, from an 85Hz setting to 72Hz.

  "<p>The Iraqi prime minister's decision to close the Baghdad offices of al-Jazeera last weekend was widely condemned around the world. Ayad Allawi claimed that the Arab news channel's reports had been fomenting crime and violence in Iraq. </p> <p>The <strong>Detroit Free Press</strong> judged the month-long ban \"one of the most foolish actions taken by the interim Iraqi government\", while the <strong>Palestine Chronicle</strong> considered it a \"Saddam-like move\". </p> <p>The <strong>al-Jazeera</strong> website condemned the closure, saying it was \"contrary to pledges made by the interim Iraqi government to start a new era of free speech and openness\". </p> <p>The network found support from the world's press for its coverage. \"Al-Jazeera may be far from perfect,\" said the <strong>Australian</strong>, \"but it looks more like part of the solution to theocracy and fundamentalism than part of the problem.\" </p> <p>The <strong>New York Times</strong> agreed. \"On the whole, it has been a healthy and crucially important force for change,\" said the paper in an editorial. \"It often stands almost alone in holding the actions of previously unaccountable government up to public view.\" The danger now for Iraq, it added, was that the closure may give Mr Allawi's government \"a freer hand to abuse human rights and pursue personal political vendettas in the name of restoring law and order\". </p> <p>The Johannesburg <strong>Star</strong> warned that by closing an \"alternative, independent and credible voice, Mr Allawi is surely cementing perceptions that he is an American voice speaking Arabic\". </p> <p>The Lusaka <strong>Post</strong> pointed the finger of blame directly at the US. The Zambian daily noted that the closure of al-Jazeera's offices closely followed charges made by the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, that the news channel was harming the US image in the Arab world. The gagging was a \"clear demonstration of the United States' hypocrisy on issues of liberties and human rights\". </p> <p>Al-Jazeera's absence over the coming month, predicted the Saudi <strong>Arab News</strong>, will \"create a news vacuum which others will surely fill\". The way to stop the media from showing \"pictures of prisoners being humiliated or hostages being beheaded\", it concluded, \"is not to shoot the messenger; it is to stop the abuses\".</p>",
  "<p>Prospects of sharp increases in interest rates over the coming months receded last night after the City saw a reassuring health check on inflation from the Bank of England as evidence that borrowing costs were close to their peak. </p> <p>Fears that the Bank would need to push interest rates up from 4.75% to at least 5.5% were dispelled when it said there were signs of the housing market cooling in response to the progressive tightening of policy since last November. </p> <p>With figures yesterday showing a rise in the government's preferred measure of unemployment, City analysts said the risks of a back-to-back increase in interest rates next month had receded. </p> <p>Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight, said the Bank's quarterly inflation report was \"significantly less hawkish about the inflation outlook than we expected, and a September rate hike now seems completely off the agenda. </p> <p>\"Indeed, the report suggests that the Bank of England is currently happy with the market's view that interest rates are set to reach 5% by the end of this year and peak at 5.25% in 2005. </p> <p>\"However, much will clearly depend on developments in the housing market over the coming months.\" </p> <p>The Bank's governor, Mervyn King, said at a press conference yesterday that there was evidence that activity and prices in the housing market were beginning to ease. </p> <p>The view of the nine-strong monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates once a month, is that inflation will gradually rise towards its 2% target while growth will slow down next year. </p> <p>\"The committee's central view is that consumption will continue to decelerate in the wake of moderate income growth and a weaker housing market,\" Mr King said. </p> <p>The governor added that the precise path of interest rates would depend on economic developments and that there were \"significant risks\" to its central forecast. It was possible, he said, that inflation might be lower as a result of supply-side improvements to the economy or a sharper than expected slowdown in the housing market. </p> <p>On the other hand, the apparent lack of any spare capacity in the economy and the tightness of the labour market might result in inflation being higher than anticipated. </p> <p>Data from the Office for National Statistics yesterday provided mixed messages on the state of the labour market. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by 13,700 in July to 835,200, its lowest level for 29 years, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 2.7%. </p> <p>Judged by the international yardstick of people looking for work unemployment rose by 27,000 in the three months to June. </p> <p>With 26,000 people dropping out of the jobs market altogether, the labour force survey showed that employment dropped by 53,000 over the quarter. </p> <p>The unemployment rate on this measure, deemed as more reliable by ministers, rose from 4.7% to 4.8%, while the employment rate for those of working age dropped by 0.3 points to 74.6%. </p> <p>Average earnings, closely tracked by the Bank as a guide to inflationary pressure in the labour market, remained unchanged in the second quarter at 4.4%, or 4.2% excluding bonuses. </p> <p>The ONS said job losses continued in manufacturing. Employment in factories in the three months to June stood at 3.37 million, down 102,000 on a year earlier. Higher output and fewer workers meant productivity rose by 5%. </p> <p>Brendan Barber, TUC general secretary, said: \"In the face of the relentless fall in manufacturing jobs, firms are driving their staff harder instead of investing in new equipment and training. This is not going to break manufacturing out of the spiral of decline.\"</p>",
  "<p>A new division could not eliminate the same old problems for Wolverhampton Wanderers, who needed two late goals to avoid a second straight defeat, against 10-man Preston. </p> <p>But for the 35th-minute dismissal of the former Manchester City midfielder Dickson Etuhu, the Wolves manager Dave Jones knows he would have been conducting his second major postmortem less than one week into the season. </p> <p>Even when Etuhu was given his marching orders for a silly shove on Kenny Miller, the hosts struggled to stamp their authority until North End finally caved in in the closing stages of a thrilling finale. </p> <p>\"I'm very disappointed with Dickson's response,\" said the Preston manager Craig Brown. \"We're obviously very disappointed with the result in the end but that's our own fault. </p> <p>\"When you retaliate like that you risk an ordering off. There was no violence but the boot was very high from Miller. It was a dangerous challenge. </p> <p>\"It changed the whole course of the game because we were comfortably in control.\" </p> <p>Jones said he was disappointed with the reaction of the home crowd, who booed the players off at half-time. </p> <p>\"Where's the money gone,\" they sang as goals inside the opening quarter of an hour from Chris Lucketti and David Healy stunned Molineux into silence. </p> <p>\"I don't think we got out of jail; they got out of jail because their keeper made some mangificent saves at the end,\" Jones said. \"The game changed on their sending-off but that's not my fault.\" </p> <p>Jones had demanded a much improved performance following Sunday's shambles in the Potteries which not only ended in a 2-1 defeat but also saw two team-mates Kenny Miller and Shaun Newton attempt to knock the living daylights out of one another. </p> <p>Yet Jones's words fell on deaf ears as a disastrous sequence of events in the home defence led to Preston's captain Chris Lucketti making a fourth-minute breakthrough from eight yards shortly after Healy had hit the post. </p> <p>Then, soon after Lucketti had been allowed a free header, the Northern Ireland striker Healy doubled the lead with a right-foot shot after the home defence had failed to deal properly with a corner. </p> <p>It was only in the final quarter of an hour that Jones saw his side spring into life, Andy Lonergan producing a series of splendid stops to keep out Miller, Newton and Ince. </p> <p>Yet the England Under-21 international was helpless as Leon Clarke gave Wolves a 76th-minute lifeline after Colin Cameron's shot was saved. Three minutes later Miller's equaliser broke brave Preston's hearts.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Rowe says he no longer knows what gender he is. Fifteen years ago, he underwent genital surgery to become a woman. But after seven years of living in his female persona, Paula, he stopped wearing women's clothes and now considers himself trapped in gender limbo.</p> <p>When we meet, Rowe, 54, is wearing baggy cut-off combat trousers, a denim shirt and a baggy T-shirt. He says he wears loose clothing to try to disguise his breasts, which developed after taking female hormones. His grey hair is long and straggly. As a result of electrolysis and surgery to reduce his lower jaw, his face is quite androgynous. However, his strong arms and broad hands look manly. His voice is soft but also masculine.</p> <p>\"Some days I'm Paul, other days I'm Paula,\" he says. \"I'm trapped between male and female. Sometimes I don't know which toilets to go into. I get challenged if I go in the ladies but if I go in the gents they stare at my boobs. I just wish we had unisex toilets like on the continent.\" </p> <p>Rowe, who grew up in Cornwall, dressed in women's clothes from early childhood. \"I have five brothers, it was a very macho household,\" he recalls. \"But while they were out playing rugby I was secretly dressing up in my mum's clothes.\" </p> <p>He suffered from anxiety throughout his teens and found cross dressing a way of coping. \"I was shy and lonely,\" he says. \"I felt comfortable in women's clothes - it was a release for me.\"</p> <p>Rowe says he only felt driven to physically change gender in 1988, following a series of personal traumas. Over the previous four years his mother had dies, he had gone through two divorces and lost his job as a geologist. He started drinking heavily and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with severe depression. When Rowe returned home he discovered his second wife, Wendy, had walked out on him and he succumbed to despair.</p> <p>\"I came out of hospital to an empty house and thought I'd had enough of this. It's either suicide or something else,\" he recalls.</p> <p>The \"something else\" ended up being a sex change. Rowe says he was encouraged to undergo gender reassignment by members of a transvestite support group: \"You learn all these things you need to say and do to get a sex change from transsexual and transvestite groups.\" </p> <p>But he contends he was not in his right mind when he made the decision to change gender. \"I would have done anything to change my life,\" he says. \" I was totally obsessed with changing my identity. I thought by changing sex I could put the heartaches I'd suffered as a man behind me.\" </p> <p>In January 1988, Rowe had his first appointment with a psychiatrist at the gender identity clinic at Charing Cross hospital, the main NHS centre dealing with the treatment of gender identity disorders, including transsexualism. The psychiatrist warned him of the seriousness of his decision to change sex. But Rowe says he was too distraught to take it in.</p> <p>\"As your body changes you have new hopes for the future,\" he says. \"It was almost a religious experience. What I was looking for was some sort of change but it was the wrong change.\"</p> <p>International guidelines state that patients usually have lived full-time in their desired gender role for at least a year before genital surgery, to see how they cope with work, family, friends and relationships. </p> <p>But Rowe says few people were aware of what he was doing because he had little contact with his family at that time. \"I used to dress as a woman in the toilets of Victoria station before the appointments with my psychiatrist,\" he says. \"I changed back immediately in the hospital toilets. You feel as though you should meet the expectations of the transsexual sorority and the doctors.\"</p> <p>The transgender psychiatrist prescribed Rowe oestrogen and anti-androgens, to suppress his body's production of testosterone. Following surgery to reshape his jaw and reduce the size of his Adam's apple, he underwent genital surgery in July 1989. In total the operations cost him around \u00a313,000. \"I sold my house to pay for the operations,\" he says. \"In the weeks before my sex change I was living in a camper van.\"</p> <p>His hopes of a happier life after the surgery did not last. Two weeks later Rowe's father died of lung cancer, which left him depressed again. When he turned up at the funeral as a woman, he says some friends and family were outraged. He says: \"My brothers were shocked by what I'd done. Some people said to my face I was responsible for killing my dad.\"</p> <p>Rowe cut off all contact with his brothers and moved into a small flat in Penzance, 30 miles away from where he grew up. Things seemed to be looking up when he met a divorcee called Peter who moved in with him. Rowe insists that he was never attracted to men before changing sex. He says that they became lovers because he was desperate to live like a woman and Peter didn't care about his background. \"I was accepted well as a woman,\" he says. \"I was quite a gentle person.\"</p> <p>The couple moved to Harrow in north-west London, after Rowe was accepted on a photography course. But a year later Peter died suddenly of a heart attack. Rowe was alone and depressed again. Over the next couple of years he came to doubt whether he had been right to change gender. </p> <p>\"I thought: 'what the hell have I done?' \" he says. \"I loved playing folk music on the guitar which was a fairly male thing. I was too ashamed to try to rejoin that crowd. And I'd always liked working on cars. I realised I hadn't really wanted to be a woman. I just wanted to be happy.\"</p> <p>Happiness now seems out of reach to Rowe. Since he stopped wearing women's clothes and make-up he has been harassed by gangs of youths. \"I've been spat at in the street and called names like paedophile, geezer and weirdo,\" he says. One episode of harassment culminated with a brick through his car windscreen. \"The police were no help,\" he says. \"I got the impression that they thought if you're a weirdo what do you expect.\"</p> <p>Thinking he might fit into society better, Rowe nearly had a mastectomy in March. But he backed out in fear of suffering complications. \"I didn't want to go through any more pain,\" he says. He knows that any surgery to try to 'reverse' his sex change operation and build him a new penis would not leave him with anything that looked realistic. He says: \"I can never become a complete man again. There's no turning back.\"</p> <p>Rowe says his story should be a warning to those who think that changing sex will automatically change their lives for the better. He now believes that he was a transvestite but became confused about his gender identity because of his depression. \"I think that society should be more accepting of people who do not confirm to traditional dress codes,\" he says. \"All I can hope for now really is making the best of a bad job.\"</p>",
  "<p>A City high-flyer was sacked during her maternity leave because she implied that her boss did not keep his word, a London employment tribunal was told yesterday. </p> <p>Diane Winship, 35, had broken the golden rule in the City - that your word is your bond - by suggesting that Ralph Goldenberg, of Goldenberg, Hehmeyer &amp; Co, had backed out of the deal to allow her to return to work permanently on a part-time basis once her maternity leave had ended. </p> <p>In bad-mouthing the company's co-founder to colleagues and allegedly calling him a \"fucking liar\" she had thrown doubt on his integrity and broken much-needed trust, the company's director of talent development, Janet Shlaes, told the tribunal. </p> <p>\"I felt that Diane's credibility and that of the firm had been undermined,\" she said. </p> <p>\"Within the trading industry, your word is the contract and it is crucial that the firm is seen to have integrity. If a partner's word is questioned it is a huge issue.\" </p> <p>The US futures trading company sacked Ms Winship, of Island Gardens, east London, from her \u00a370,000-a-year job as a financial controller in September. </p> <p>She claims sex discrimination and unfair dismissal. The company denies the allegations. </p> <p>Ms Shlaes, who chaired a disciplinary hearing, admitted that she had not investigated whether Ms Winship had, as she claimed, reached an agreement with Mr Goldenberg to return to work for two to three days a week after her maternity leave. </p> <p>Ms Winship, who had been with the firm for four years, claims that three months into her maternity leave Mr Goldenberg said she must work full-time, and gave her two weeks to decide her future. </p> <p>The firm brought disciplinary proceedings against her, saying her complaints to colleagues about her situation were damaging it. </p> <p>The president of the tribunal, Sandra Pontac, asked if Ms Shlaes had made a mistake in failing to check if there was an agreement, and whether she was exaggerating the impact of Ms Winship's outburst to colleagues. </p> <p>She said: \"If there was such an agreement ... it was not Mr Goldenberg's integrity that had been disparaged - it was the applicant's. She was the one who was wronged, not Mr Goldenberg, or at least there would have been a balance. </p> <p>\"If there was an agreement and you did not think it was central, wasn't it your job to find out why she believed that and if it might be true?\" </p> <p>Ms Shlaes replied: \"Three high-level people who worked with her said that they had no knowledge of such an agreement.\" </p> <p>The company contends that there was never an agreement because Ms Winship's job was a full-time post. </p> <p>The firm did not check her medical record and she was not given a \"good enough opportunity\" to discuss whether she had secured the agreement, Ms Pontac said. </p> <p>Throughout the disciplinary hearing Ms Winship presented herself as a \"victim\" and refused to show remorse for her behaviour, Ms Shlaes said. </p> <p>\"If she had taken responsibility or apologised it would have changed it.\" The hearing continues tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>Over the next couple of years, hundreds of thousands of doctors, nurses and other NHS staff will be vetted, photographed and issued with smart cards. No, it's not the national identity card programme, though the exercise may provide useful logistical lessons. This procedure is to ensure that the NHS knows exactly who is logging onto a countrywide system of electronic medical records under the \u00a36bn NHS National Programme for IT. </p> <p>The new system's security is under severe scrutiny. The British Medical Association is urging doctors to boycott the new Care Records Service because of fears that it will damage medical confidentiality. Privacy International, a pressure group, last month named the programme \"most appalling project\" in its annual Big Brother Awards. </p> <p>Documents seen by the Guardian suggest that the NHS is planning extraordinary efforts to protect access. Whether the measures are workable remains to be seen. </p> <p>The documents, marked \"NHS confidential\", set out procedures for verifying doctors' identities and managing the issue of smart cards and digital keys. These will be needed to use any IT system connected to the new data \"spine\", which will transmit patients' medical and social care records and allow appointments to be booked electronically. The spine's access-control systems are based on an existing system, the Government Gateway, which routes data between Whitehall departments. </p> <p>To issue the new IDs to 80,000 doctors and many more nurses and other healthcare professional staff, the NHS proposes creating a network of registration authorities reaching into every hospital and surgery. </p> <p>The principle is that everyone issued with a key will be personally vouched for by an authorised sponsor who is confident of their identity. This must be done through face-to-face meetings. After filling in a form called RA01 (which comes with three pages of terms and conditions in small print), the applicant has to provide a current passport or driving licence and a set of \"community\" identities to prove address. Nationals of non-EU countries should show that their passports contain \"either UK stamps, a visa, or UK residence permits showing the immigration status of the holder in the UK\". All records of registration authorities have to be kept for 25 years. </p> <p>Interestingly, there is no mention of a biometric check, such as a fingerprint or iris scan. This is probably because the NHS is waiting to see what procedures are decided for the national ID card. </p> <p>Successful applicants will get smart cards with a user ID generated by the NHS and their own password. The card specifies the user's place in a three-tier hierarchy of privileges. If doctors forget their password or lose their cards, the registration authority has to \"arrange a suitable face-to-face meeting\" where the sponsor can verify their identity. </p> <p>The new routine will have to be put in place within months, before the first production release of the spine goes live. (A prototype, called Phase One Release One is currently being tested.) NHS IT chiefs hope that the procedures will convince sceptics that an electronic system is more secure, as well as deterring members of the public from attempting to impersonate hospital staff. </p> <p>An authoritative survey of doctors' opinions suggests there is some way to go. It finds that, although a majority of doctors support the programme, levels of enthusiasm are declining. The survey, by Medix, a specialist medical polling organisation, put questions to a sample of 852 doctors. Three quarters said they expect electronic records to improve clinical care. On the controversial question of whether patients should opt in or opt out of the national system, there was overwhelming support for the NHS's plan that records should be automatically included unless patients opt out. </p> <p>However, the survey, the fourth of its kind, found that only 54% of respondents were enthusiastic about the programme, a fall from 65% in the previous survey. A common complaint was lack of consultation: 40% said they had received no information. Three quarters of GPs agreed that they should not use electronic records until the BMA's concerns about the system are met. </p> <p>In response to such concerns, the national programme is stepping up a hearts and minds campaign to promote the new technology. \"We recognise that important issues have been raised and that we should respond openly and constructively,\" a spokesman says. </p> <p>To involve patients' representatives, the programme is recruiting a Care Record Development Board to \"inform the work\" of the national programme. According to the recruitment pack, the board will \"identify major issues and create short-term action groups to address them through appropriate consultation.\" Applicants must be members or organisations, health or IT professionals or managers of an organisation \"providing health or social care services\". </p> <p>The spokesman says that the programme, until now notorious for its secrecy, would be adopting a higher profile. \"We have also recently started a programme of meetings with the media and other stakeholders. We will build the momentum.\"</p>",
  "I am appalled to hear of the death of 14-year-old Adam Rickwood at Hassockfied secure training centre (Report, August 11). My child Joseph Scholes died aged 16 after just nine days' incarceration in squalid conditions and following dehumanising treatment at Stoke Heath children's prison, Shropshire, in March 2002. Since Joseph's death, I have campaigned for a public inquiry into issues, including sentencing policy, allocation and provision of safe accommodation. The home secretary has chosen to delay answering my call and in that time two more children have died in the hands of the state. <p>An inquest into Joseph's death began on April 19 - the day that Gareth Myatt, a child aged 15, died during restraint by three adults at Rainsbrook secure training centre. Following the inquest verdict, the Shrewsbury coroner, John Ellery took the unprecedented step of stating he would be writing to the home secretary to request a public inquiry; I believe Mr Ellery still awaits a positive reply from David Blunkett. </p> <p>In a letter, Mr Blunkett said he was giving my family an opportunity to make comments of our own. Our comment, which he continues to consider, is as follows: </p> <p>The home secretary must act immediately to order a full public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of all the boys who have died since the inception of the Youth Justice Board, and the suffering of the children who survived those torturous conditions; and to fulfil his obligations under the European convention on human rights - to identify failing of individuals or faults in the system that may have led to or contributed to death and to enable steps to be taken to prevent the recurrence of such deaths in the future.<br> <b>Yvonne Scholes</b><br> Meliden, Denbighshire  How sad to read of the suicide of yet another young person in custody. How dispiriting to read the same day of Michael Howard's pledge to further increase our prison population and build yet more prisons. A succession of inspectors of prisons have criticised the poverty of the culture in our young offender institutions and prisons. In effect, they have become warehouses of human misery, lacking enthusiasm for rehabilitation or credible therapeutic interventions for the many in need of such help. </p> <p>The one clear determinant of suicidal behaviour is the culture and the relationships between staff and inmates. With will and investment, there could be great change. Already we top the European league table for the numbers per capita of population of young and adult offenders detained in prison. The US has a per capita prison population some five times larger than ours, held in conditions of frequently terrifying harshness, with self-harm and suicide rates to match. It seems that this is the system which our policy-makers are determined to emulate, as they compete in the law and order olympics. <br> <b>Christopher Cordess </b><br> Emeritus professor of forensic psychiatry, University of Sheffield  Record levels of suicide and self-harm among women prisoners are shaming and deserving of a proper inquiry (Five suicide attempts a day, August 9). While prisons trigger and exacerbate mental distress and one in three women attempt suicide in prison, 37% have attempted it before imprisonment. Many women who should be directed to the mental health system are instead in the penal system. Prisons are ill-equipped to cope with mental illness and on current evidence, they increase the likelihood of suicide sevenfold. Unless we address the current sentencing mess, we will be cutting people down night after night for years to come.<br><b>Dr Andrew McCulloch</b><br> Mental Health Foundation</p>",
  "Do not press your panic button unless you are dying. Do not talk out the window. Do not sit on the window sill. Do not kick your door. Do not make a wick. Do not steal from your fellow prisoners. Do not smoke on your bed. Do not seal your outgoing mail. Do not play-fight with your cellmate. Do not lend or borrow. Do not make holes in the walls. Do not graffiti on the furniture. Do not damage any prison property. Get used to it, you live here now. <p>\"Fine,\" I said. </p> <p>The prison officer shut the door. \"What do I do?\" </p> <p>And what do you do? For up to 23 hours a day I was to be locked up. I read Dante. Reading, and dreaming, was all there was to do. I thought, day in, day out, of just being free. Of being at home. I thought about my crime ... and I became bitter. I thought about why I had handed myself in to the police, and I regretted it. Prison wasn't the reforming punishment I thought it would be. It didn't make me feel guilty, it made me angry. I realised that prison did nothing to prevent crime, as once I'd thought. Prison just postpones crime. </p> <p>In Reading young offenders institute I witnessed bullying, violence, intimidation, and some of the screws were no better. One prison officer took me into the doorway of his office after bang-up, and, two inches from my face, tried to provoke me to attack him. Half the screws were like that, the other half were all right. </p> <p>In Reading I worked an average of six hours a week. I sorted stamps - a fruitful activity, though, much to my dismay, no real job prospects upon release. But there is only so much you can do with a prisoner on remand. And I was on remand for 235 days. </p> <p>On February 24 2000 I was sentenced to four and a half years for grievous bodily harm. I went straight to Feltham from court. Feltham has its own graveyard for some dead prisoners. It was the first thing I saw. </p> <p>The wing officer, seeing me and my melancholy, gave me a cellmate who was only in for one day. Luckily though, this guy had brought in drugs which helped me get through an awful night. </p> <p>I spent two and a half months in Feltham. While I was there an Asian boy was battered to death by his cellmate. I was then moved to Portland, a three-hour drive from my home town. Around 11 months into my sentence I suffered an attack of paranoid schizophrenia. I believed I was being monitored, that my thoughts were being broadcast to the officers. I believed my every move was being recorded. There were holes in the wall where nails holding up panel mirrors and poster boards had been torn out. I put my ear up to each hole listening for the mechanical buzz of recording equipment. Undecided, I filled up each hole with toothpaste. I knew that what I was doing was odd, but I couldn't help it. </p> <p>The attack lasted only several hours. Fortunately I had A-level psychology books in my cell; they offered me an explanation, and so relief. But I was worried it would happen again. And I felt desperately alone. And there was no one I could talk to about it. </p> <p>After a few months there I turned 18, and was sent to Benbow, a unit for Portland's older inmates. </p> <p>This turned out to be my worst experience of prison. An incredible amount of violence took place on that wing, and there was a great divide between black and white prisoners. This wasn't helped when, during association, one of the officers put the skinhead film Romper Stomper in the video. The officers did nothing to curb the violence and bullying on the wing, in fact they were scared of some of the prisoners. Several times I saw officers being punched by some of the tougher inmates; the officers would try their best to laugh it off. I didn't feel very safe. </p> <p>Last year I asked someone from high up in the Prison Officers Association what he thought of Portland screws. I got the impression that he didn't care much for some of them. </p> <p>For the first 1,000 days in prison, I didn't spend one second out of custody. Prison is a dreadful place, and it badly needs to change. I spent so much time thinking about just being outside, if only for an hour. But as time went by, I gradually thought less and less about leaving prison. </p> <p>On March 30 2002 - the day the Queen Mother died, the day I celebrated having served exactly 1,000 days - I was released from Portland for six hours. I had finally been granted a town visit, whereby I would be allowed to Weymouth under the supervision of my family. The grass would be greener. The sky would be bluer. I had believed that, for so long. </p> <p>But the grass wasn't greener, and the sky was grey. By midday I wanted to go home to prison. </p> <p>After that I had only two more town visits. And a few weeks before my release I was given one week of home leave. I didn't think much of it. </p> <p>I went back to prison on the Friday that England were knocked out of the World Cup by Brazil, and I had only 12 days left to serve. I made the most of them. After having hated prison for so long, I just didn't want to leave. No one had any expectations of me. There was no one I could disappoint. </p> <p>I'm very grateful for my time in prison, but I have done all right by it only because I, and other people, wanted me to. For most prisoners that isn't the case. </p> <p>After my release it took a whole month to find a minimum-wage job. Job after job, I was flatly refused. The manager of a Littlewoods store invited me to an interview. He kept asking me about prison. He was genuinely interested, but he never got back to me. I ended up working in a pub, cash in hand. The landlord had been in prison himself. </p> <p>I returned to college to restart my A-levels - I wasn't given the chance of doing them in prison. I found a more secure job, working at Sainsbury's. Fortunately, I had kept my mind active in prison with books, and last year I got three As and a B in my AS-levels. Yet I've been rejected from all but one of the universities I've applied to. People can pick and choose who they employ, and who they educate. And not surprisingly, people don't want a criminal. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Paul Carter-Bowman was released from Feltham young offenders institute in 2002; he now sits on the research advisory group for the Howard League's Out For Good project, and is about to start studying law at the University of Westminster </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "It is a long and depressing route from being a member of parliament to living in a flat in a Glasgow towerblock you are too afraid to leave after dark. To the group of swaggering young guys gathered outside - dressed in the familiar uniform of Burberry caps and shellsuits - Okwiri Rabwoni is just an easy target for their racist bile. They know nothing of his story. <p>Mr Rabwoni is an asylum seeker in Glasgow; another victim of what a sheriff described this week as an \"epidemic\" of racist attacks. Sentencing eight teenagers for a vicious and unprovoked attack on a group of Iranian men, Michael Grady QC made it clear it was not the first time he'd had to deal with such crimes. </p> <p>\"People come to this country seeking refuge and support, but they end up victims of crimes committed for nothing more than sport,\" he said. \"It is recreational racism. Time and time again, I hear of these incidents.\" </p> <p>Mr Rabwoni knows all too well their reality. There are the petty comments that he brushes off but does not want his wife or daughter to hear. \"They say 'black bastard' and such things, but nothing I have not heard before many times,\" he says. But then there are the more pernicious, and more serious, attacks. </p> <p>\"They trapped my wife in the callbox outside, would not let her out. It was very frightening for her. Now I do not like her to go to even the lifts alone,\" he says. </p> <p>And then there was the time the young guys threw a bottle at Mr Rabwoni. \"I was visiting a friend, it was daylight, three o'clock in the afternoon,\" he says. \"They were young men in a group of about eight, aged maybe 17 or 18. They said, 'When are you going back home?' and such things. Then they threw the bottle. It was a very big injury. I needed to go to hospital. I told the police and they took a statement, wrote down what happened. But then, nothing.\" </p> <p>A softly spoken, articulate man, Mr Rabwoni is no stranger to conflict. He was a major in the Ugandan army, fighting in Congo, a child soldier from the age of 14. Latterly, he was a member of the Ugandan parliament, forced out of the country after he supported the wrong candidate in a presidential campaign. </p> <p>\"Yes, I have seen fighting,\" he says. \"But I do not want to do such things here.\" </p> <p>Since the first wave of asylum seekers were sent to Glasgow's sink estates three years ago under the Home Office dispersal programme, they have struggled to integrate into their host communities. </p> <p>Most tragically, a Kurdish man, Firsat Dag, was murdered in an unprovoked attack in Sighthill. Though no racial motivation was found, Mr Dag's murder sparked racial tension in the city and, eventually, moves by many bodies to calm the situation. But how successful have these attempts been? </p> <p>Strathclyde police's most up-to-date figures, for 2003-04, reveal a 13% rise in the number of racist attacks in the city. They do not, as yet, have any figures available for the number of attacks on refugees and asylum seekers, but a report by the charity Positive Action in Housing said 175 refugees living in Glasgow had been attacked in the previous year, a rise of 75% on the year before. </p> <p>\"Asylum seekers tend to be targeted because they stand out: they may have different-coloured skin, speak in a different way, dress in a different way,\" says Chief Superintendent Alex MacDonald, Strathclyde police's asylum seeker liaison officer. </p> <p>\"But I'm not sure there is a hard core of racist offenders out there targeting asylum seekers. I think there is a hardcore group of persistent offenders who are preying on the vulnerable.\" </p> <p>Outside the shops in Pollokshaws, where asylum seekers have been integrated with less obvious trouble than other areas of the city, there is some dispute over Mr MacDonald's opinions. </p> <p>\"It is hard to be African in this city,\" says a woman who gives her name only as Patience. \"Other people may also be frightened by these people, but if they are saying you are a black this it must be racism. Is that not true, my friends?\" </p> <p>An elderly lady, Margaret, agrees. \"It's racist, hen, of course it is,\" she says. \"But they would be at you if you had a limp or if you had red hair or were old or whatever. They've made our lives a misery for years. Now they've got you lot to pick on.\" </p> <p>Behind the shops, a group of young guys are smoking. They won't give their names. \"If they don't like it here, they can fuck off back home, can't they?\" says one. </p> <p>The Scottish Refugee Council says it is the sort of comment asylum seekers, in a city which has a small ethnic minority population beyond its Asian and Chinese residents, face regularly. \"We want to make it clear that it is not the majority of Scottish people who feel or act this way,\" a spokesman says. \"But there are a group of people who do. They should be targeted by the law - and the rest of us should try to make sure asylum seekers don't think the whole country is like that.\"</p>",
  "<p>The lottery winner serving life for attempted rape is almost certainly immune from compensation claims, it emerged today.</p> <p>Iorworth Hoare, 52, who scooped one third of last week's \u00a321m Lotto Extra jackpot in spite of being in the process of serving his 18-year sentence, was thought to have been open to claims from victims as a result of his new-found wealth.</p> <p>But SocietyGuardian.co.uk has learned that as Hoare's crimes date back at least 15 years, and in some cases even further, time limits on victim compensation laws effectively protect him from claims.</p> <p>Richard Scorer, a partner at law firm Pannone &amp; Partners, said the law on this was \"black and white\". </p> <p>\"The time limit for bringing compensation claims for these kind of crimes is six years,\" he said.</p> <p>The only exception to this rule is for child victims, he said. \"If you are a child when the incident occurs, the clock doesn't start ticking until you turn 18 - so you would have until [aged] 24 to bring a claim,\" Mr Scorer said.</p> <p>However, even this is unlikely to make any difference in Hoare's case. He was convicted in 1989 for attempted rape, following a string of offences including rape, that began in 1973. The Law Commission published a report two years ago in which recommendations to change this law were put forward.</p> <p>However, it is understood that the government has no immediate plans to act on the commission's advice. \"Like many Law Commission reports, it's probably gathering dust on a shelf,\" Mr Scorer said.</p> <p>Charity Victim Support also said Mr Hoare's victims were likely to be powerless to bring claims. \"We understand that the length of time [that has passed] will make it difficult, nigh impossible, for victims to make a claim,\" a spokeswoman said.</p>",
  "Most legends contain a small grain of truth, but none is to be found in the fraudulent images being presented each day by the BBC (and the US networks). The print media is not much better. Official propaganda is constantly repeated in sentences such as: \"On June 28 the United States and its coalition partners transferred sovereign control of Iraq to an interim government headed by prime minister Ayad Allawi. The transfer of sovereignty ended more than a year of American-led occupation\". <p>Meanwhile, US intelligence agencies admit that the size of the resistance increases every day. If Moqtada al-Sadr were to be captured or killed in the fighting taking place in Najaf, the steady trickle of recruits could become a flood. In such a situation and with no official opposition to the occupation in the Commons it should be the responsibility of the media to ensure that some truth, at least, is regularly reported. </p> <p>The capitulation of the BBC has been in evidence ever since the Hutton whitewash. This is not just a question of journalists censoring themselves. Earlier this summer the new director-general Mark Thompson reportedly told a meeting of the corporation's news board there was a \"perception\" that BBC news was too leftwing and critical of the government - a perception which needed to be corrected. He must be happy now. </p> <p>The notion that Iraq today is a sovereign state governed by Iraqis is a grotesque fiction. Every Iraqi citizen, regardless of political views or religious affiliation, is aware of the actual status of the country. And if the BBC carries on in this fashion, its credibility, already at an all-time low, could disappear altogether. Condoleezza Rice, the US national security adviser, declared some months back: \"We want to change the Iraqi mind.\" But the US-funded Arab TV channel called Truth has proved a dismal failure. And now, to prevent any alternative images from reaching Iraqis and the rest of the world, a plucky puppet at the \"ministry of information\" has banned al-Jazeera TV from reporting out of Iraq - a traditional recipe from an oppressive cookbook. </p> <p>The \"handover\", designed largely to convince US citizens that they could now relax and re-elect Bush, was also an invitation to the western media to downgrade coverage of Iraq, which it dutifully did. As Paul Krugman noted in the New York Times last week: \"Iraq stories moved to the inside pages of newspapers, and largely off TV screens. Many people got the impression that things had improved. Even journalists were taken in: newspaper stories asserted that the rate of US losses there fell after the hand-off. (Actual figures: 42 American soldiers died in June, and 54 in July).\" </p> <p>Like previous confections to justify the war, this one is not working either. Of the two Iraqis plucked from obscurity to be the front men for the occupation, \"President\" Yawar is a relatively harmless telecoms manager from Saudi Arabia. He was perfectly happy to don tribal gear for official functions and photo ops with Rumsfeld and the boys. \"Prime minister\" Allawi was at one time a low-grade intelligence employee for Saddam, reporting on dissident Iraqis in London. Subsequently, Anglo-American intelligence outfits recruited him. After the first Gulf war he was sent to destabilise the regime. His hirelings bombed a cinema and a bus carrying children. </p> <p>Before the war Allawi helped manufacture the 45-minute WMD delivery systems warning for the dodgy dossier men in No 10. After the occupation he was rewarded and put on the \"governing council\". He then hired a lobbying firm, which spent $370,000 campaigning in Washington for him to be made prime minister, and also got him a column in the Washington Post. </p> <p>As \"prime minister\" he cultivates a thuggish image. On July 17 in a remarkable despatch from Baghdad, Paul McGeough, the Australian correspondent, (and former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald) alleged: \"Iyad Allawi, the new prime minister of Iraq, pulled a pistol and executed as many as six suspected insurgents at a Baghdad police station, just days before Washington handed control of the country to his interim government, according to two people who allege they witnessed the killings. </p> <p>\"They say the prisoners - handcuffed and blindfolded - were lined up against a wall in a courtyard adjacent to the maximum-security cell block in which they were held at the al-Amariyah security centre ... They say Dr Allawi told onlookers the victims had each killed as many as 50 Iraqis and they 'deserved worse than death'.\" </p> <p>McGeough's report continued: \"The prime minister's office has denied the entirety of the witness accounts in a written statement ... saying Dr Allawi had never visited the centre and he did not carry a gun. But the informants told the Herald that Dr Allawi shot each young man in the head as about a dozen Iraqi policemen and four Americans from the prime minister's personal security team watched in stunned silence.\" McGeough appears regularly on TV and radio to defend his story, which does not go away. </p> <p>The fact is that Iraq is in a much bigger mess today than before the war. The situation was summed up by a former inmate of Abu Ghraib prison: \"We want electricity in our homes, not up the arse.\" </p> <p>The citizens of the aggressor states can see this for themselves and regardless of the media will, one must hope, punish their leaders for taking them to war - regardless of the fact that the alternatives on offer are so weak. In the US, Senator Kerry is an unconvincing politician. Unlike some of his liberal apologists, he does not like to portray the Democrats as the consistently less aggressive of the two parties. It was, after all, Democratic - not Republican - presidents who launched the wars in Korea and Vietnam. The Republican Eisenhower's electoral appeal in 1952 was based on being the more peaceful of the two candidates. In 1960 Kennedy attacked the Republi cans for the \"missile gap\", denouncing their weakness before the Soviet threat. Carter, not Reagan, launched the second cold war. And in 1992 Clinton was thundering against Bush senior's weakness on Cuba and China. Now Bush junior has outpaced any Democratic rival in accelerated militarism. But it is enough to remember that on the eve of 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Joseph Lieberman organised a letter, signed by nearly every Democratic senator, denouncing Bush's Middle East policies. They wanted more support for Israel. </p> <p>It is necessary to bear this record in mind, as pressure has built up for the US left to fall into line behind Kerry. Many will, understandably enough, vote for him to get rid of a warmonger government. If they succeed, he must be put under immediate pressure to withdraw from Iraq. If there had been no resistance in Iraq, the triumphalism of warmongers would have drowned out oppositions of every hue. The defeat of the warmongers, if it happens, will be the outcome of what is happening in Baghdad and Basra, Falluja and Najaf. Even if they try and brush aside the 37,000 Iraqi civilians killed in this conflict, according to a recent estimate by an Iraq-based NGO, Bush and Blair will not forget the names of the cities whose people refuse to surrender. There is only one serious option: the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> An updated paperback edition of Tariq Ali's book, Bush in Babylon: the Recolonisation of Iraq, is published by Verso next month </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tariq.ali3@btinternet.com\">tariq.ali3@btinternet.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Like a referee holding aloft the arm of a winning prize-fighter, Michael Vaughan yesterday proclaimed Andrew Flintoff the new champion cricketer of the world. That is the heavyweight division, presumably. </p> <p>It is a big call. And, even though most champions end up with their noses pressed firmly against the canvas, no one would like to pick a fight with \"Freddie\" these days, on or off the field. </p> <p>\"Someone mentioned the other day that Freddie is the best cricketer in the world at the minute and I'm not going to argue with that,\" said Vaughan, who was preparing for the third Test against West Indies, starting at Old Trafford today. </p> <p>\"He's on the crest of a wave and playing exceptionally well. People talk about his powerful hitting but not many mention what a good technique he has. </p> <p>\"The crowd here will go mad when he walks out to the wicket. If he can control his emotions, the way he's playing, he'll get another big score.\" </p> <p>The England captain, like everyone else, marvels over what Flintoff has achieved in the past 12 months. Overall his 38 Tests have produced 1,876 runs at an average of 31.79 and 79 wickets at 38.64. In the past year (16 Tests) he has scored 1,193 runs (47.72) and taken 46 wickets (30.08). </p> <p>\"A year ago, when the crowd roared, he would try to hit the first ball out of the ground,\" Vaughan added. \"He's got to 20, tried to do it again and got out. But he's learned a hell of a lot.\" </p> <p>But, if Flintoff is the team's champion, England are looking to their hero of a few months ago to regain something of his old brio over the next few days. </p> <p>Steve Harmison took 23 wickets at 14.86 in four Test matches in the Caribbean and carried his form into the summer with 21 at 22.09 in the three matches against New Zealand. In this series, though, his form has faltered. He has taken only three wickets - two at Lord's and one at Edgbaston - and they have cost 81 runs apiece. </p> <p>Bowlers are not robots - rumours that Glenn McGrath might be one were scotched by his recent injury - and Harmison was never going to keep up his astonishing strike rate. </p> <p>The slow pitches in those first two games were not to his liking but there was also a suspicion that his rhythm was not quite right. A return to form on a pitch that should have some pace and bounce would be most welcome. </p> <p>\"The wicket here could suit him a little bit more,\" Vaughan said. \"If he gets his rhythm and some carry, which we hope to have at Old Trafford, Steve will be a hell of a handful. </p> <p>\"If you ask most of the West Indian batsmen who they don't want to face it's still Steve Harmison. I don't think he's bowled that badly. The West Indies have played him really well.\" </p> <p>Vaughan certainly has a point when he says that Harmison's heroics have increased the pressure on him. \"It's a credit to him that people are saying that he hasn't got many wickets in two matches. It's a sign of how far he's come. The expectation levels have risen because of his performances.\" </p> <p>\"It's not a worry on my part. He's bowled some good spells in the two games without taking wickets whereas in the winter and against the Kiwis he was taking wickets with similar balls. He's fresh, has practised hard for two days and, if Lady Luck is on his side, he could get a bagful here.\" </p> <p>The only pencil-chewing moment for Vaughan will be choosing between the local hero James Anderson and Simon Jones, whose ability to reverse-swing should be encouraged by the abrasive nature of this pitch. </p> <p>The decision could be hampered by bad weather. The sun shone brilliantly yesterday, which means a monsoon cannot be far away. </p> <p>England have won eight out of nine Tests this year and, if they win here, it will be the first time they have won six in a row for 46 years. They beat West Indies 2-0 in 1957, did not tour that winter and beat New Zealand 4-0 in 1958. </p> <p>The fourth Test that year was at Old Trafford, when the England selectors experimented for the winter tour to Australia and brought in Ted Dexter, Ray Illingworth and Raman Subba Row for their first caps, and still won by an innings and 13 runs. </p> <p>An equally large margin is not inconceivable this time, against a limited and clearly demoralised West Indies side. \"We've played some good cricket in the last eight games,\" Vaughan said. \"And when the match could go either way, as happened in the Caribbean and a couple of times against New Zealand, we have performed, taking the game away from the opposition. </p> <p>\"I can see it in the eyes of the players that they are very eager to keep this run going.\" </p> <p>And, like every good boxing referee, Vaughan knows this contest is almost over. </p> <p><strong>Pitch watch</strong></p> <p>Dry and very hard, though some grass has been left on. Wonderfully lush outfield. </p> <p><strong> Weather</strong> Rain. Possibility of some sun and thunderstorms. </p> <p><strong> Temperature</strong> Maximum 19C (66F). </p> <p><strong> Humidity </strong> Maximum 88%. </p> <p><strong>Win toss and...</strong></p> <p>...bat on what looks like a belter. But rain on the first day could delay final team selection. </p> <p><strong>Probable teams</strong></p> <p> <strong> England </strong> Trescothick, Strauss, Key, Vaughan (capt), Thorpe, Flintoff, G Jones (wkt), Giles, Hoggard, Anderson/S Jones, Harmison. </p> <p><strong> West Indies</strong> Gayle, Devon Smith, Sarwan, Lara (capt), Chanderpaul, Joseph, Bravo, Baugh/Jacobs (wkt), Collins, Collymore, Edwards. </p> <p><strong> Umpires</strong> Aleem Dar (Pak) and Simon Taufel (Aus). </p> <p><strong> Third umpire</strong> Mark Benson (Eng). </p> <p><strong> Match referee</strong> Ranjan Madugalle (SL).</p>",
  "<p>Chariot racers brought their horses to the ancient Olympics by boat on journeys that could often last weeks. These days Britain's equestrian team flies in the kind of luxury normally reserved for those sitting in first-class. </p> <p>When Pippa Funnell's horse, Primmore's Pride, travelled here from London last Saturday the price for his ticket was \u00a34,750. </p> <p>For that journey the gelding, on whom rests Britain's hopes in the three-day event, travelled in his own personal aluminium container, was given specially padded travel boots to protect his hooves, and luxuriated in an aeroplane cooled to around 18C (64F) specially for his comfort. </p> <p>During the flight Primmore's Pride received constant pampering from his groom, Hannah Bailey, ate as much hay as he could eat, and received regular visits from an on-board vet to check his welfare. </p> <p>The days when horses were sedated and put into wooden boxes for air trips are long in the past. \"Horses are much more used to travelling nowadays,\" said Jenny Hall, the veterinarian for the British team. </p> <p>\"To be successful, they have to travel a lot more than in the past. The travel conditions and arrangements are much better.\" </p> <p>All the same, it was a relieved Funnell who gave Primmore's Pride a special rub of the snout when the two were reunited in Athens later in the day. \"I travelled separately but I was quite paranoid,\" admitted Funnell. \"I took the horse to the airport myself and loaded him on to the plane. </p> <p>\"The riders hardly worry about ourselves at all but we're completely obsessed about our horses. I wanted to see that he was happy but he was pigging so much hay I thought, 'You are not in the least bit bothered'.\" </p> <p>Anyone who has seen the two together would think Funnell and Primmore's Pride are like a couple of young teenagers in love, so much do they dote on each other. </p> <p>\"It's not just about man and horse,\" she said. \"It's about man and your best friend because you are with them every day. It's a relationship that is built up. To me that is the best thing about the sport.\" </p> <p>An illustration of how closely rider and horse rely on each other came yesterday when Sarah Cutteridge was forced to withdraw from Britain's team because her horse, The Wexford Lady, had suffered an injury. Mary King on King Solomon has replaced them and, as one of the best riders in the world, should not affect Britain's chances. </p> <p>Primmore's Pride stands 17.1 hands high and weighs 550kg, and this beast has helped Funnell to become one of Britain's biggest hopes for a gold medal. </p> <p>Last year Funnell and Primmore's Pride became the first pair in the history of the sport to complete the three-day grand slam of Kentucky, Badminton and Burghley. It earned Funnell a \u00a3165,000 bonus from Rolex and led to a nomination for the BBC Sports Personality Of The Year award. </p> <p>\"I was mentally really shattered after last year but I've had one of the quietest springs I've ever had,\" said Funnell. \"I feel recharged.\" Unlike racing, where jockeys often sit on horses for the first time just before the race, success in eventing is generally the result of a partnership between horse and rider based on trust built up over time and experience. Funnell has been riding 11-year-old Primmore's Pride since he was two. Upon his arrival here, Primmore's Pride has continued to receive first-class attention in the specially built stables. </p> <p>There is a 16-strong support team, including grooms, trainers, a vet, a doctor, a physiotherapist and a farrier, to look after him and his equine colleagues. The British Olympic Association have also shipped in more than 900 kilos of feed. </p> <p>But then the gelding is among the best athletes at the games - on four or two legs. </p> <p>Eventing is regarded as the ultimate test of horse and rider, combining the three disciplines of dressage, show jumping and cross-country to produce an overall winner. </p> <p>Eventing was included in the Olympic Games for the first time in 1912 and since then Britain have won 13 individual and team medals - more than any other nation - including a silver, with a team containing Funnell, in Sydney. </p> <p>The team event involves five horses and riders with the best three scores counting towards the team result. With three of the world's top four riders in their squad, Britain are big favourites. \"Basically everyone is expecting us to get gold,\" said Funnell. \"But there are 10 or 15 that are well capable of winning. It's a stronger field than we have ever seen at an Olympics.\" </p> <p>But Funnell knows what her main target is. \"My number one priority before winning a gold medal is seeing my horse is OK.\" </p> <p><strong>High riders - Four for the three-day event</strong></p> <p><strong> William Fox-Pitt </strong> (Great Britain) </p> <p>There is no doubting his determination, and he has the credentials. He also has an outstanding horse in Tamarillo, with whom he won Badminton this spring. </p> <p><strong> Nicolas Touzaint </strong> (France) </p> <p>Took eventing by storm last year when he won France's first European championship gold for 10 years. Rides the talented grey Galan de Sauvag\u00e8re again in Athens. </p> <p><strong> Bettina Hoy </strong> (Germany) </p> <p>Regularly scores top marks in the dressage and could easily win the individual gold if she can achieve a successful cross country round on the experienced Ringwood Cockatoo. </p> <p><strong> Blyth Tait </strong> (New Zealand) </p> <p>The 43-year-old has maintained a low profile recently, but has been carefully preparing Ready Teddy (his 1996 gold medal partner) for these games.</p>",
  "<p>The anti-terrorism measures taken to protect athletes in Athens moved from expensively extreme to the outright bizarre last night when it emerged that US military personal competing in the games had been instructed to take the precaution of growing their hair longer. </p> <p>Seventeen serving US soldiers taking part in the Olympics, in sports such as shooting, fencing and athletics, were given the grooming advice during recent briefings on protecting themselves against possible terrorists attacks. Longer hair would make them less identifiable as military personnel, officials told the athletes. </p> <p>With US officials worried about anti-Americanism engendered by the war in Iraq, the entire team in Athens has been issued a with a range of instructions aimed at making them less conspicuous, including the suggestion that they tone down any victory celebrations, do not question officials' decisions and do not wear US team clothing on the city's streets. No hair care tips were proffered - which is just as well as the crew cut and the shaven head is de rigueur among the modern generation of athlete. </p> <p>Even those at whom the advice was aimed seemed to have ignored it. Seven members of the US Army's Marksmanship Unit - a special unit that travels the world competing in tournaments - have been selected for Athens. All turned up a press conference yesterday looking every inch the pristine soldier, including Sergeant Daryl Szarenski, who was sporting a fairly severe buzz cut. </p> <p>Szarenski said he had given up trying to look civilian years ago. \"When I've been in Europe in the past I've tried to look as European as possible and people come up to me in the street and ask me 'Where are you stationed in America?'\" he said. </p> <p>\"The way I see it, I'm an American soldier, I'm proud to be an American soldier and let's just leave it like that.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Marion Jones's lingering hope of defending her 100 metres title looks certain to be dashed. The 37-year-old Gail Devers, who finished fourth in the US Olympic trial, is reportedly \"enthusiastic\" to take up the place that Torri Edwards must give up after failing a drugs test, ahead of Jones, who finished fifth in the trial.</p>",
  "<p>Teenage American sporting prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are hardly in short supply around Athens. Yet even in a United States squad boasting the swimming legend-in-waiting Michael Phelps (aged 19), the $100m marketing industry that is the basketball star LeBron James (19) and a gang of precocious young gymnasts with medal prospects, 17-year-old Collyn Loper cuts an Olympian figure. </p> <p>Physically unimposing, personable and noticeably lacking in multi-million-dollar corporate sponsorships, Loper will line up on Monday with 16 other competitors in the women's trap shooting - in which participants attempt to shoot randomly-launched four-inch clay disks out of the sky with a 12-gauge shotgun. </p> <p>She will not win a medal - she is ranked in the 20s in the world - though as the congenitally mawkish types who run US sports television are fond of saying, simply by qualifying for the games she has won already. </p> <p>For once, the soggy hanky brigade might be right. </p> <p>Loper - winner of a gold medal at the Pan American games - was born blind in one eye, the victim of a hereditary disease called coloboma - \"a kind of cancer of the eye,\" in her words - which left her without the use of her right eye. </p> <p>\"My grandfather had it, my mother has it. But I'm the only one in my family who is blind from it. Trust me to lose it all,\" she said yesterday. \"You would think I would have chosen another sport to get into.\" </p> <p>Being brought up in Alabama - the heart of American gun country - choosing a sport other than shooting was less likely than it might seem, even for someone with a disability such as hers. </p> <p>Loper was introduced to the sport by her father Brian at the age of eight. She owned her first gun within a year. Within four years she was performing respectably in international amateur competitions. She is currently the youngest member of the United States's highly rated shooting team, having won the US national champions this year to qualify for Athens. </p> <p>\"My father was always into hunting and shooting,\" she says. \"Believe it or not, it's a family pastime where I come from - it's not seen as this terrible, dangerous thing. Plus, my dad is like my best friend. Sharing my dad's interest in guns was a way we could spend more time together.\" </p> <p>Shooting also gave Loper the chance to indulge her passion for sport after attempts at other games foundered on her disability, which has left her without any depth perception. \"I would swing at a softball and miss it by miles because I had no idea how near or how far the ball was away from me and would usually be swinging at fresh air.\" </p> <p>Loper's father guided her towards trap shooting after working out that she had most difficulty with objects that were coming towards her. In trap, the clays are randomly scattered away from the shooter. A natural right-hander, she has to shoot left-handed, which enables her to take aim with her one good eye. </p> <p>\"The only problems I have sometimes is with targets that go off to my right side, my blind side,\" she says. </p> <p>\"And if you can't see the target, you're not going to hit it, are you? I've got to be really focused on the right-hand clays otherwise I'll miss them.\" </p> <p>It is not unusual in shooting for some marksmen and women to cover one eye with tape, or wear goggles with one lens blacked out, during a competition, which has led at least one of Loper's US team-mates to suggest that her disability might actually have helped her. </p> <p>\"You don't have to shoot with both eyes in this game,\" Lance Bade, a former Olympic bronze medallist, says. \"One eye has its advantages: you see a little sharper image of your barrel. You don't get a blurred barrel or a double barrel or a double target.\" </p> <p>It may be an advantage for Loper's sporting career, but in her daily life being half-blind presents many difficulties, especially now that she has her driving licence. </p> <p>\"There have been a couple of incidents that could have been nasty but I managed,\" she says, grinning. \"Hopefully, it'll be like shooting and I'll get much better the more practice I get.\" </p> <p>If the teenager sounds oddly insouciant about her disability, that is only because Loper has come to accept it. </p> <p>\"I could sit around all day and be bitter about the bad genetic luck I've had but what's the point in that? It's not as if I had sight in both eyes at one point and then lost vision in one. I've always only had sight in one eye. </p> <p>\"The way I like to think about it is that having sight in just one eye hasn't done me too much harm,\" she says, pointing in the direction of Athens's magnificent Olympic stadium. \"After all, look where I am today.\"</p>",
  "<p>Brian Lara was adamant. \"Can we stick to this Test match please? I'm here to do a job for the next two weeks, which is Test cricket - two Test matches. That is my main focus. What happens after that is going to come in due course.\" </p> <p>The West Indies captain had been asked why his three fellow selectors had announced a squad for the Champions Trophy next month but not named a captain. The simple answer would have been that the board was meeting later to ratify the selectors' recommendation, as required by its constitution. And when, eight hours later, the board duly named Lara, it came as no surprise. </p> <p>After all, only a month ago he led his side to the NatWest Series final after beating England twice and knocking them out of their own competition. Nor would it have made sense for the board to undermine their captain halfway through a Test series when, theoretically at least, they still have a chance of levelling matters with wins here, starting today, and next week at The Oval, where Lara will lead the side out for the 39th time. </p> <p>However, since Sir Viv Richards, the former chairman of selectors, laid into Lara before, during and after the Edgbaston Test, his captaincy has been a major topic of conversation, with the betting being that he will lose control sooner rather than later, and certainly before the team go to Australia in December. </p> <p>At Derby last week the team manager Tony Howard issued an unheralded statement supporting his captain. \"Although the results in the Test series thus far have not been satisfactory,\" he said, \"this has not diminished the commitment and support that the team has expressed in the captain and in his ability to bring out the best in them. </p> <p>\"Brian remains committed as ever to the endeavour of raising the standard and quality of West Indies cricket and is as disappointed as our many fans in the end result achieved in the Test series thus far.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately for Howard he chose to end by saying that the team \"is looking forward to the last tour match [against Derby] and the final two Test matches, fully focused on achieving better results\". </p> <p>The statement was issued before play on the first day. Shortly after lunch the West Indians were bowled out by a below-strength attack in just over 40 overs with one or two batsmen ending their chances of Test places and the coach Gus Logie said to be close to tears. </p> <p>Then this week Lara's vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan was wheeled out to support his leader. \"Of course you have to feel for Brian,\" he said. \"I don't think this would be easy for any captain. With the position that West Indies cricket is in, it is not fair that blame lands on him; it has a lot to do with past years and the structure of cricket in the Caribbean, preparation and so forth. </p> <p>\"We will continue to support him. We have to try and support each other as much as possible, and at difficult times someone needs to speak up; as a team you need to help other individuals along.\" </p> <p>Lara himself was keen to talk about this subject yesterday. \"Individual performances are not what we are looking for,\" he said. \"We are trying to get a team performance together - guys bowling in tandem, partnerships when the batters go out there, and especially in the field. We have to support the bowlers. That is the most important part of any team.\" </p> <p>However, the fact remains that Lara must somehow motivate a young, losing side which has allowed the opposition to dominate from the start in both Test matches. At the end of the first day at Lord's England were 371 for two and at Edgbaston only marginally worse at 313 for five. </p> <p>If they fail, and lose a third successive series to England for the first time, the odds will be heavily against Lara leading them out a 40th time.</p>"
