  "<p><strong> Eichmann: His Life and Crimes </strong><br>by David Cesarani<br>352 pp, Heinemann, \u00a320</p> <p> Through Hannah Arendt's New Yorker coverage of his trial in 1961 and her book Eichmann in Jerusalem, Adolf Eichmann is remembered mostly for her famous catchphrase, \"the banality of evil\". It was a persuasive if erroneous reading. There was very little banal about Eichmann, though at his trial most expressed disappointment at his insignificance. Where was the strutting SS officer in his death's-head cap who had boasted of killing millions of Jews? Only Harold Rosenberg, writing in Commentary, noted a level of calculation in his performance, \"created over the years for just this courtroom situation\". </p> <p>Eichmann's trial was taken to be about many things; for most it was about totalitarianism. Only Eichmann saw it as being about himself. Indeed, his own convoluted version, with him as death's reluctant travel agent, is now taken to be more accurate than the prosecution's case of grand conspirator. This is not to excuse him. In this excellent and thorough biography, with its emphasis on the political mechanisms and confusions that allowed for such a moral collapse, Cesarani points out that, by the time he was finished in Hungary in 1944, \"he was rotten from the inside out\". He explains Eichmann less in the context of totalitarianism than by charting the process through which a man not hard-wired to kill ends up a willing collaborator in the business of genocide. </p> <p>The result is scrupulously objective in a way its subject would have approved. Any hatchet-job is reserved for Arendt, dismissed as an unreliable witness because her prejudices ironically mirrored those of Eichmann. Her German Jewish bourgeois background expressed itself in a long-nurtured contempt for the \"Ostjuden\" and her comments on the Israelis veered into racism. It is an instructive lesson, verging on black comedy, on the complications of prejudice. </p> <p>As much as Eichmann's, the prejudice of others determined the deportation of Europe's Jews. Hungarian officials proved especially willing subscribers, undertaking all duties from asset stripping to loading the trains, leaving Eichmann with little to do. He played the violin at soirees in a quartet of co-workers. Young women in his office found him handsome and \"cheery\". He played table tennis with the secretaries. In his book Danube, Claudio Magris noted: \"The technocrat of massacre loved meditation, inner absorption, the peace of the woods, maybe even prayer.\" </p> <p>His undoing was the deep humourlessness noted by his captors, accompanied by an even more striking inflexibility of mind. His lethal delusion was exemplified on the one hand by his insistence on himself as a referent, carrying out orders approved by his superiors; and on the other by his disappointment when a book he wrote in May 1942, with an anticipated print run of 50,000, was banned. Its subject was statistical data of Jewish transports. Of his work, he commented without irony: \"Time just flew by.\" </p> <p>Cesarani dispels myths of Eichmann's unhappy childhood, placing him against the normal but selective background of Austrian Calvinism - very different from the previous picture of an embittered man who turned Nazi on grounds of social disgrace and economic hardship or out of resentment against Jewish employers. Eichmann, diligent worker and dutiful son, grew up in a milieu where dislike of Jews was unremarkable; where little animosity was displayed towards individual Jews but \"Jewry\" was viewed as an alien body in the German national organism. It was a fantasy to which he became increasingly susceptible, but he was not driven in the first instance by racial hatred. </p> <p>His was a job-in-waiting rather than one envisioned, with no sign that the underfunded SS department he joined before the war would become instrumental in anti-Jewish policy. Cesarani takes the current position on the Third Reich as more muddle than efficiency. At his trial Eichmann described in numbing detail administrative structures of such byzantine complexity and density that he vanished into insignificance within them, until one of the judges, moved to exasperation, declared: \"It is clear to us that, in German, the predicate comes at the end of the sentence, but it takes too long to reach the predicate.\" His captors had previously noted his German as \"hideous - the jargon of a Nazi bureaucrat pronounced in a mixture of Berlin and Austrian accents and further garbled by his liking for endlessly complicated sentences in which he himself would occasionally get lost\". </p> <p>The road to genocide was neither as predictable nor predetermined as has been assumed. Eichmann's department distanced itself from Goebbels's rabble-rousing with cooler arguments, declaring that Jews were entitled to their own national homeland and Germany should do all it could to assist. Eichmann first showed his teeth in 1938 in Austria, speeding up Jewish emigration and devising a funding mechanism whereby the wealthy paid for the emigration of the poor, a blatant scam that made sense only in the context of discrimination and terror. </p> <p>His more acceptable face was evident the following year. As emigration still remained the order of the day, he was happy to cooperate with Zionist smugglers organising illicit transports of Jews to Palestine. But his essential indifference became apparent in the enforced deportation of Jews to Poland in 1939, a project dressed up in the language of \"resettlement\" that left thousands to rot in an inhospitable landscape. The lesson learned by Eichmann's superiors from his lethal efficiency was that it was possible with little expenditure of effort or capital to deport wholesale. Eichmann then went to work on the Poles. His development was complete before extermination became official. The job remained the same regardless of the fate of his transportations. </p> <p>The notorious Wannsee conference of 1942 here becomes less of a point of no return and more of a rationalisation of an existing unofficial policy. Mass shootings of civilian populations on the eastern front had already been carried out and local pogroms were encouraged. By the end of 1941, more than half a million Jews had been slaughtered and the killing had grown indiscriminate. And no one wanted the responsibility of being lumbered with Eichmann's deportations. </p> <p>Eichmann's own transition to genocide was not entirely smooth. He had been revolted observing killings in the field and recorded his loss of face at Auschwitz where \"they laughed, naturally, when my nerves broke down and I couldn't keep my military dignity\". He moaned that annihilation wasn't a political solution, being enough of a careerist to know that previous solutions offered more chance of prestige and promotion than mass murder. </p> <p>After the war he demonstrated a cunning for survival noted at his trial. Life in hiding in Germany consisted of several rural idylls, apparently untroubled by conscience, but after his escape to South America the career took on an air of willed failure. He missed out on the Nazi gravy train in Argentina. Josef Mengele, Auschwitz's \"angel of death\", was moving in exalted circles. Eichmann, by contrast, was on the verge of squalor. The two men met and failed to get on. Mengele made an offer of free medical treatment, which Eichmann, perhaps mindful of the doctor's wartime experiments, declined. All his businesses failed. He even had a go at his old job, working as transportation manager (for a firm manufacturing sanitary ware), but that didn't work out either. </p> <p>His capture was not the zealous affair his kidnapping suggests. No one cared particularly about Eichmann. The world was moving on. A Mossad agent on the case said it was left to a blind man living 10 hours away from Buenos Aires to prove Eichmann's identity. By then he was so down on his luck no one could believe a high-ranking Nazi fugitive could reside in so nondescript a place. Confronted by such a poor wretch his captors were \"touched, even a bit disgusted\" by his shabby underwear. In a way, the only person who cared by then about him was Eichmann himself. </p> <p>He was a willing captive, recognising that without trial he was nothing. His arraignment in Israel was the justification of a ponderous man eager to state his case, and the one unshakeable element in his defence was a capacity for self-justification. The element missing in Cesarani's compelling portrait is Eichmann the actor, the theatrical man who liked the uniform and the power it bestowed. In that one sees the historical destiny described by Primo Levi, who wrote of a man \"ringed by death\", surrounded by and selected by death just as the millions he had dispatched were selected for death. He joined them, willing but unrepentant, on May 31 1962, hanged in a makeshift execution cell.</p>",
  "<p>Dundee was traditionally associated with the three Js: jam, jute and journalism. And it remains the headquarters of DC Thomson, publisher of such august organs as the Beano and the Dandy. So it seems appropriate that one of the city's universities, Abertay, has been a pioneer in developing another form of entertainment for the young. Its four-year BSc course in computer-games technology was a first in Europe, its five-year MSc was a world-first, and it now has an international reputation in the field. What's more, some of its students have helped to design and update the Beano website.</p> <p>If Dennis the Menace and his chums seem somehow incompatible with the serious world of engineering, then that's probably because our view of what constitutes an engineer tends to be outdated. Asked to name five famous ones, most of us would opt for Isambard Kingdom Brunel, George Stephenson and James Watt. After that, we'd be struggling.</p> <p>Yet the profession includes an extraordinarily wide spectrum of practitioners, from the designers of great hydro-electric projects to the bloke who fixes your washing machine.</p> <p>There is, as yet, no university course in washing-machine maintenance, but it can only be a matter of time. Meanwhile, higher education institutions are coming up with more and more eye-catching courses to attract students to a subject with an image unfairly anchored in the past.</p> <p>Staffordshire offers, among others, courses in film production technology and forensic engineering. (The latter is nothing to do with crime-solving, as it happens, but a chance to analyse and interpret the failures of engineering systems.) York offers a BEng or an MEng in music technology, which requires not only an A or B grade in maths and physics at A-level, but also the ability to play a musical instrument to at least grade seven. Bath has MEng courses in space technology and sports engineering - with a chance to design and build your own bobsleigh.</p> <p>Other universities, meanwhile, are offering the opportunity to specialise in motor sports. One of the first to raise the chequered flag was the University of Central Lancashire, in Preston, which offers four courses built around the booming race scene. The BEng in motor sports engineering has on its staff Euan Baldry, a former designer for the Williams team. It's a three-year course with an option to do an extra year in the industry and, as with the other three, 200 points are required.</p> <p>\"Mind you, we have students here with 400 points,\" says course leader Dr John Calderbank. He goes on to point out that his students have the chance to go racing themselves. \"We put our own team in the Open Telecom North-west Formula 4 championships,\" he says.</p> <p>Sheffield was the first university in the country to offer an MEng in motor sport engineering management. Two As and a B (340 points) are required, one of which must be in maths and the other in a lab-based science.</p> <p>\"We want them to be potential entrepreneurs, so we've set up a business alongside the degree,\" says Eleni Rodrigues, who designed the course along with John Yates, a professor with 20 years of racing experience behind him. \"As part of the the Sheffield University Motor Sport Company, students will be expected to get involved technically and organisationally, finding clients who want parts and then designing them,\" Rogrigues goes on. \"In the first year, we'll send them to accredited institutions to get experience as marshals or scrutineers, and they'll be able to apply for a competition licence if they want to.\"</p> <p>As a mechanical engineer herself, Rodrigues is keen to stress that MEng students will have a sound grounding in her subject before specialising. And that would seem to be sound advice for all would-be engineering students. \"Leave your specialisation as late as possible,\" urges Andrew Ramsay, executive director of the Engineering Council UK. \"There's a natural break point after two years, which will give you a chance to assess where you want to go.\"</p> <p>Ramsay points out that top universities, such as Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial and Warwick, offer general engineering courses that provide a solid grounding for a wide range of options. Other institutions well regarded by employers, he says, include Bristol, Nottingham, Strathclyde, Bath, Sheffield and Loughborough. \"If possible, would-be students should try to spend a year in industry before going to university,\" he says. \"Then they'll have some idea about what actually goes on rather than relying on impressions gleaned from fathers, uncles or design and technology teachers at school. There'll be plenty of opportunity for swanning around the world when they're qualified,\" he adds, pointing out that top engineers tend to be well-paid and well-travelled.</p> <p>\"About a third of this country's venture capitalists turn out to have had some training in engineering,\" he says. \"And companies such as PriceWaterhouseCoopers like engineers because they're highly analytical, they can do the sums and they're not fazed by unusual requests.\"</p> <p>Graduates also find their way into telecommunications, power and water supply, environmental projects, the armed forces or the sophisticated IT operations of major banks. Some even go into companies that make things. \"Manufacturing industry employs only about a quarter of those registered as chartered engineers in the UK,\" Ramsay cautions. Nonetheless, the biggest engineering faculty in the country is still at Coventry University, based in the manufacturing heartland of the West Midlands. \"Like the former polytechnics,\" he says, \"it gets hardly anything at all in terms of government-funded research, so it has to get down and dirty with local employers.\"</p> <p>That's what polytechnics did in the days when traditional universities tended to concentrate on pure scientific research. But three and a half miles up the road from Coventry's campus, on a greenfield site at the edge of the city, lies the engineering empire of the man who changed all that.</p> <p>The recently ennobled Professor Lord Kumar Bhattacharyya arrived at Warwick University in 1980, when engineering companies were haemorrhaging jobs and the future looked bleak. As a well-travelled outsider (his father was India's ambassador to the United Nations), he could see what needed to be done. The Japanese had proved that rigour in design and great attention to detail were required.</p> <p>Easier said than done, given the prevailing attitudes in traditional universities at the time. \"Britain's education system had a lot to answer for,\" says Bhattacharyya. \"All I wanted to do was inject quality people into manufacturing management, but academia wasn't interested in applied research unless it was in medicine or law. Getting involved with industry was seen to be selling your soul.\"</p> <p>He remains eternally grateful to Jack (later Lord) Butterworth, an innovative vice-chancellor looking to make a mark for Warwick at a time when it was still considered an upstart among universities. Butterworth made Bhattacharyya professor of manufacturing systems and let him get on with it.</p> <p>Nearly 25 years on and his International Manufacturing Group occupies six buildings on campus, having long outgrown the department that spawned it. This is the headquarters of the Warwick Manufacturing Group, formed as a club of largely Midlands-based companies who put money into the university in return for research facilities and a conveyor belt of properly trained graduates. Annual revenues are now well over \u00a380m and more than 5,000 postgraduates are educated every year through its worldwide network of operations. WMG recently opened a training, research and development centre near Shanghai. \"You have to be where the action is,\" says Bhattacharyya.</p> <p>\"Some of our graduates are earning billions on the east coast of China and elsewhere in the East. They've developed new, world-breaking products and they know how to make them. Too many youngsters think they can come out of business schools and become multimillionaires without any kind of speciality. MBAs don't produce good cars and aircraft. Engineering is very challenging.\" And what is required if you want to pursue that option at Warwick? Three straight As, including maths and a lab-based science, preferably physics. \"We might let in occasional students who've missed the third A if they can show at interview that they have the right kind of mind,\" says Bhattacharyya.<br></p> <p><strong>Case studies</strong><br></p> <p>Grant Blake, 35, is studying mechanical and automotive engineering at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne</p> <p>\"I was working as a technician in the automotive industry and wanted to move up to the next level. I'd always been interested in the design of automotive systems and decided to go back into education. I went via the foundation route, which brought me up to speed with mathematics.</p> <p>The degree is a good balance of classical studies (fundamental thermodynamics and mechanics) and the electronic simulation aspects, which can be applied directly to industry.</p> <p>I've worked with some of the younger students on the Formula Student Project, where we built a racing car to take to a competition at Bruntingthorp aerodrome in Leicestershire.</p> <p>I found the stage 2 part on statistics and series the hardest. If I had taken an A-level I would have had a reasonable grounding in it. I just had to work extra hard and get on with it.</p> <p>For the previous two years I've worked in industry to get more experience, but this year I was lucky enough to receive a Nuffield Foundation grant and worked in the department on a biomedical simulator for people with spasticity, for doctors to use in training.

I've suffered the loss of my parents while I've been at the university, and received very good support. I'm pleased I chose Newcastle because it's an easy city to live in. It's good to be part of a university that's trying to raise its profile - it makes it feel quite upbeat. I've just been offered a job as a graduate engineer at Vosa, the vehicle certifications agency, and I'm starting in September, which is great.\"<br></p> <p>Jenny Tsang, 23, is studying construction engineering at the University of Ulster<br></p> <p>\"Originally I applied to do a degree in estate management because I have always been fascinated with buildings. I just missed my A-level grades and construction engineering was the alternative course I was offered. I thought the management element would be appropriate, and the course director informed me that if I did well enough in my first year I could transfer on to the estate management course.</p> <p>I did do well enough to transfer, but I enjoyed the first year so much that I decided to stay on the construction engineering course. The second year was also spent at the university, then in the third year I worked as a civil servant in a government building near Stormont Castle, looking after the NHS estates. I learnt so much that year. I spent my fourth and final year back at the university. The university is very close-knit and the tutors are fantastic. I've met a lot of good friends. In my year there were six girls out of a class of 40.

  "<p>There are many train journeys in my novel The White Hotel, from a turbulently erotic ride in the Austrian Alps to a journey of slaughtered Jews to Palestine or Purgatory, and I wrote it during a year of train journeys. 1979 was a time of transition for me. The pleasant rural-English college where I had taught for 15 years had been closed; I'd been granted a year's sabbatical back in my alma mater, New College, Oxford. I spent half of each week in a bare postgraduate cell behind New College garden, the other half in my Hereford home. In two homes in Hereford, really, since my personal life was complicated. The idea for the novel sprang at me one morning in my cell. I wrote it on two typewriters - in Hereford and Oxford. All year I felt dreamy and spaced-out in my divided world. So did my closest friend and former colleague, also in Oxford, who ended his year's grace by committing suicide. </p> <p>Deciding to try my luck as a full-time writer, I settled into unaccustomed and unwelcome writerly solitude, completing The White Hotel and starting another novel, Ararat. When the former appeared, in Britain and the US, it proved a surprising - and controversial - success. I had chosen to encompass the extremes of pleasure and pain, Eros and Thanatos. A young opera singer, Lisa, is analysed by Freud in Vienna, and writes for him what he calls an \"inundation\" of violent sexual fantasy. The centrepiece of the novel is his analysis of her. Naturally he traces her hysterical illness back to her childhood; later, it appears that, being half-Jewish, her illness stems from a premonition of the \"real hysteria\" of the Holocaust. Some readers hated the sex; others, the violence. But a French woman, a journalist, told me my book appealed to \"les foux, les femmes and les juifs\". Of course not all madmen, and certainly not all women and Jews; but enough to gain a great number of readers. </p> <p>I have heard a perhaps apocryphal tale of how my novel first came to be optioned as a film. Someone at a Hollywood party urged Barbra Streisand to take on a more serious role, and suggested my book. She went straight to the producer Keith Barish (of Endless Love ) and said: \"Keith, you owe me a favour; I want you to buy The White Hotel.\" Mark Rydell, who had just made On Golden Pond, was to direct. I had a short, uneasy meeting with him in his New York apartment. His mind seemed to be on other things. He didn't last. Maybe Streisand's interest waned too when another, more postmodern director, asked how he would deal with the sex, told her of his idea of inserting glass fibre optics into the heroine's vagina. She is said to have changed the subject at that point, saying: \"Let me show you my mansion\" and never mentioned the film again. \"Soon to be a major movie\", on the 1982 Penguin paperback, seemed a shade optimistic. </p> <p>Just as Barish and Streisand were dropping out, a stranger with a Texan drawl phoned me: \"My name is Bobby Geisler. Are the movie rights to The White Hotel available? If so, my partner John Roberdeau and I would like to buy them. We're ready to jump on a plane right away, to meet you anywhere.\" I was flattered and impressed by the way his gentle voice caressed the words \"The White Hotel\": a lover's caress. I happened to be planning a quick visit to London, so offered an hour of my time. My agent Andrew Hewson and I met Geisler and Roberdeau in the Great Western Hotel at Paddington. </p> <p>The ebullient Americans filled us in on their background and achievements. Aged around 30, they looked too young to have produced Robert Altman's 1983 film Streamers, as well as a Broadway revival of O'Neill's Strange Interlude . Bobby Geisler was stout, with a round, soft face that looked at me quizzically and respect fully through small metal-framed glasses. In his sales pitch for the film rights he was shining-eyed, idealistic, rapturous about their determination to do the novel justice. John Roberdeau was neat, trim, quieter, more businesslike, but equally enthusiastic and with an infectious chortle. </p> <p>I can still see and hear Bobby, stroking his red braces, projecting his vision of the opening of the film. \"Lisa in the train compartment, turning the pages of her score... The opening chords of Mozart's Don Giovanni, and the first lines of the poem! ...Can you imagine it, Don?\" I could. And I recognised in his joyous eyes an obsession matching mine as I wrote the book. Andrew, a calm, dignified Scot, was a little more cautious, but agreed with me that they deserved a chance. They wanted me to write the screenplay, and dreamed of luring their idol, Terrence Malick, out of seclusion to direct. We sealed the deal in the hotel. They took a plane straight back to New York; I, the Adlestrop-peaceful trainride back to Hereford, with the opening chords of the Don Giovanni overture resounding in my head. </p> <p>I lived in a small 1930s semi, writing in a one-room extension my wife and I had had built on. It wasn't so long since I'd been writing poems on a card-table in our bedroom. A friend had told her friend that I was a poet and worked in the bedroom. She'd said: \"Oh, that's awful! How dreadful for his wife!\" She had misheard poet as pervert. I was a poet/pervert, used to selling verse collections in the hundreds of copies. Now I was anticipating \"a major movie\"... the big time. </p> <p>The upfront money from Geisler/ Roberdeau (Briarpatch Film Corporation, as they called themselves) didn't quite come through when it should have. Just a problem of moving it around between accounts, they assured us. We could see they were raw adventurers, riding on the seat of their pants; but that was part of their charm. Equally raw at writing screenplays, I did my best. They wrote encouragingly of my first draft - \"What a great image, Don!... We love this scene... Could you maybe...?\" and so on. </p> <p>Coincidentally they were to be in Paris at the same time as I was to be there running a writing workshop. We met for a dinner in an expensive restaurant, where they introduced me to Joe, a friend. A big fan of my book, the guy said, pumping my hand. Half way through the meal, slightly fuddled by wine, I started to realise their agreeable friend was trashing my screenplay. Geisler and Roberdeau sat in embarrassed and complicit silence. It was no surprise to be told, soon after, that they were hiring someone else, the historian Charles (\"Chuck\") Mee. They had decided to chuck me for Chuck Mee. With Chuck they went around Europe hunting for locations and standing at his shoulder as he typed away. </p> <p>Terrence Malick having resisted their charms, they had turned to Bernardo Bertolucci. They thought his Last Tango in Paris wonderful. Bernardo, it seemed, loved my book. Geisler and Roberdeau brought us both, with spendthrift generosity, by Concorde to New York, simply to take a look at some new ultra-realistic film technology called Showscan. Bernardo and I both felt nauseous after watching a Big Dipper sequence. We could imagine how the opening erotic fantasy might be even more spectacular shot in Showscan. I heard nothing more about it. It seemed to vanish instantly from Geisler and Roberdeau's restless vision. </p> <p>What was unceasingly impressive, though, was their energy and enthusiasm. Partners in life as well as work, they had a telepathic connectedness. I would listen entranced to their operatic duets - that seems the appropriate term - in which they constantly interrupted and completed what the other wished to say. And that was never anything bitchy about competitors, but expressions of admira tion for fellow professionals (cameramen, dancers, designers) who had agreed to be in their team for the great movie of - that stroking of a lover's skin by Bobby - The White Hotel. They were hot for it, the team was ready to go! </p> <p>It no longer included Chuck Mee. I have lost count of the various writers who at one time or other have produced screenplays of my novel. If, for me, there was a certain Schadenfreude in seeing Chuck chucked, there was no pleasure in seeing Bertolucci dismissed - just as he was about to win an Oscar for The Last Emperor. They told me he'd wanted to concentrate too much on just one aspect of my novel, Freud and psychoanalysis. But perhaps Bertolucci dismissed himself; how could I know? Anyway, he was out. And David Lynch was in. </p> <p>My foreign trips for movie meetings, or to help launch a foreign publication, were rare interruptions in a life spent mostly in solitude, huddled before - by now - a computer. I'd plunged into a sequence of \"Russian\" novels - each one less commercially successful than the last. But the writing, for me, was all; I love the blank screen, the nape-prickle of tentative creation. I can't pretend, though, that I didn't welcome the occasional generous invitation to New York, for yet more discussions of the movie. On one visit, I shared an ascending hotel elevator with an attractive woman wearing sunglasses. When she stepped out I thought: \"Jesus, that was Meryl Streep!\" Dizzily I went up and down the elevator three times, hoping somehow to find her again, and by miracle I did, since she almost at once came down again. I ran after her in the lobby. Still at heart a working-class boy from Cornwall, for whom \"the pictures\" spelt magic, I was in awe. Knowing she was being considered for the role of Lisa, I introduced myself. She said: \"Oh my! I have your book by my bed!\" I later wrote her a card saying if she had time to meet for a drink... She didn't acknowledge it. But I treasure her radiant smile as, at cocktail hour, she swept in a dazzling gown through the hotel lounge towards the exit and recognised me. People all around looked at me, thinking - I hoped - \"Gosh, he knows Meryl Streep!\" </p> <p>I don't know if she liked, or even finished, my novel. It didn't matter: with David Lynch on the verge of signing, his girlfriend Isabella Rossellini was to star. Lynch insisted on it. Well, she was beautiful and intelligent too. We were, of course, endlessly discussing actors and actresses. There is scarcely a star of either sex in Hollywood or elsewhere who has not appeared in the imagined movie. Boy-actors, once considered to play Lisa's step-son Kolya, are now too old for any part. </p> <p>There was now also an impressive new screenwriter - Dennis Potter. I wrote to him saying how pleased I was. We had so much in common: working-class boys from isolated mining communities; going in the same year to the same Oxford college. In fact, I have a vivid memory of seeing him acting, redhaired and charismatic, in a Pirandello play performed in New College garden - the very place where my novel had been born. It all seemed perfect synchronicity. To cap it all, he was living just 20 miles from Hereford, in his native Forest of Dean. I proposed we should meet midway for a drink. Potter replied with a brief refusal, saying that he believed meetings should happen by chance. </p> <p>Maybe he was so committed to his task that he was loath to let a conversation with the book's author get in the way of his vision for the screenplay. There was no doubting his commitment, to judge by reports of his first meeting with Lynch, in the fall of 1990. A day of Biblical rain in New York... a winey dinner... On parting, Potter's face streamed with tears as his crippled, arthritic hands grasped Lynch's lapels. If they didn't screw it up, he said, if they saw it through to the end, this would be the work they would both be remembered by. \"This movie will be the Madame Bovary of our time.\" </p> <p>When I was sent Potter's screenplay, I was dismayed to find Freud and Vienna deleted, and my operatic heroine now a high-wire act in a Berlin circus. Don Giovanni and Eugene Onegin had given way to jaunty Potteresque tunes from the 30s. Geisler and Roberdeau explained that Lynch didn't feel he could deal with European high art. He liked the lively Potter screenplay, and so, with reservations, did they. Their dream - though certainly not mine, with that screenplay - was about to be fulfilled; they were to be in Paris on New Year's Eve, 1990, and Lynch was to fly from LA to join them and - sign! </p> <p>As they were getting ready to pop the champagne cork at the Ritz, a maitre d' handed Bobby Geisler a phone. It was Lynch, still in LA. He and Isabella had parted, and he could not make the film without her. Sorry. Happy New Year. </p> <p>\"The boys\", as I sometimes called them now - with a slight edge of cynicism but mostly affection - found it hard to recover from that New Year catastrophe. Vaguely, later, I heard that Hector Babenco, director of Kiss of the Spider Woman , was in the frame; but he fell out of it. They commissioned a treatment from Joan Juliet Buck - one which, when I read it years later, struck me as faithful and intelligent - but this too went the way of all White Hotel screenplays. </p> <p>There were too many changes going on in my life for this to seem any more than a disappointment on the edge of things. My first wife, Maureen, left me, for a much more attentive second husband; I suffered illness and depression. For a year I couldn't read, let alone write; almost my sole, pallid enjoyment each day was playing the musical highlights of South Pacific. Now with my second wife, Denise, and our son Ross, I was hell to live with. Imagine having to listen to South Pacific every day for a year... But we moved to my childhood land, Cornwall, in 1987 and I gradually cheered up. And wrote a novel about another obsession of mine, JFK's assassination ( Flying in to Love ). I heard nothing from \"the boys\" for a few years, but it didn't seem to matter much. </p> <p>Then, after Dennis Potter died of cancer in 1994, they invited me for a reading performance of his screenplay at the Lincoln Center. It was a touching tribute to a man they had come to regard as a friend. It was also lavishly extravagant: staged by Anne Bogart, sound score by Hans Peter Kuhn; actors including Rebecca De Mornay, Brian Cox and Len Cariou; Lauren Flanigan singing and the Hudson Shad re-creating the period music. After this feast, dinner al fresco for 300 guests and, in my case, disgracefully drinking Rebecca's last bottle of good wine in her suite, while she yawned and waited for me to go. It was a splendid evening, but with unfortunate consequences for Geisler and Roberdeau. A caterer's claim that he wasn't paid in due time led to Geisler's being charged with grand larceny and marched in handcuffs down to the notorious \"tombs\" beneath the district court. He spent most of his night in the cells using his phone for the benefit of fellow prisoners, calling their dealers, girlfriends and lawyers, usually in that order. </p> <p>Months later the charge against him was dismissed. But all was not well with them financially. Sometime later I found they had had to give up their Greenwich Village home and move permanently into a hotel: certainly not a white one. </p> <p>For another long period I had no real contact with them. Each Christmas a sprig of holly would be Fedexed to my home. They never failed in such endearing gestures. Then at last I received an elated message: Emir Kusturica, a dynamic Serbian director, was going to make the movie! Not only that, they had found a perfect lake by which to create the perfect white hotel, and had been promised the use of the Yugoslavian army for extras. I would love Emir, Bobby said; he was a macho dynamo of energy and ideas. Dusan Kovacevic, a collaborator with Emir, was going to do some work on Potter's screenplay. Freud could come back, they thought, though probably not the opera. </p> <p>Wining and dining me in 1998, while I was in New York for the launch of my biography of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, they were in exuberant mood. It had been a long hard road but... we were close to our goal at last! Emir was on the verge of signing. They were trying to persuade him to have Juliette Binoche as the lead. He was a little doubtful, wondering if she was too sexually frigid, but they were working on him. Though Nicole Kidman was also keen to play the role. And for Freud, well, maybe Anthony Hopkins... </p> <p>Then Nato attacked Serbia. </p> <p>Emir's son almost died when a bomb fell just 40 yards from him in Belgrade. Enraged, Kusturica refused to make a film for American producers. He did, though, somewhat ironically, come west to make a movie with Juliette Binoche. As for Bobby and John, they crawled like hurt animals into a corner. Yet they revived to struggle on towards their dream, contacting director after director. More than 50 were approached in all. Including, bizarrely but imaginatively, Woody Allen. The boys did have one break, persuading Malick to direct The Thin Red Line. Completed well over budget and not without major discord, it won seven Academy nominations. </p> <p>My contract with Briarpatch Films contained a standard clause reverting all rights to me if no film had been begun 10 years after exercise of option. That date was July 10 2001. None of us had anticipated the clause being activated, but the crucial date was now approaching. Andrew and I kept reminding them of this in letters and emails, but heard nothing from them until the spring of 2001. Then they invited us to Paris for a weekend: me, Andrew, and his vivacious wife and partner Margaret. Bobby and John, greeting us warmly as ever, appeared unchanged from when we'd first met them. They introduced us to a tough-looking attorney, Sam Myers, an American in Paris. I gathered he was now the \"boss\"; he was keeping a close eye on how much champagne they ordered. Bobby still caressed the words \"The White Hotel\" like silk. They were going to make that movie if it killed them! They were talking to a new director, Pedro Almod\u00f3var... </p> <p>They had made some mistakes, John admitted during a confessional session. Over-committed themselves. A promised investment in 1993 hadn't come through. Foolishly, needing instant cash, they had borrowed, from one Monty Montgomery, $200,000 against the security of the film rights. The loan was foreclosed by Montgomery, and the rights to The White Hotel passed to him for the sum of one dollar. Well, yes, I thought, that was pretty foolish, that was a pretty small sum; and wouldn't it have been kind of polite to have told me? Anyway, Sam Myers had swiftly ridden in on a white charger to buy the rights back from Montgomery. Myers's rights, of course, would end on July 10. They wanted now to discuss a three-year option agreement with Myers's new company, Night Hawk, based in Gibraltar. Myers would employ Geisler and Roberdeau as producers, assuming I would grant Night Hawk option rights after the July reversion. </p> <p>I didn't understand all of John's embarrassed spiel during the confessional outpouring. Bankruptcy, irate investors, stupid judges... this wasn't my scene; I loathe going to a lawyer, or solicitor, would rather visit the dentist. The main point John stressed was that there was nothing in the legal sphere to prevent a new option agreement. I was glad when the talk switched back to making the film. Bobby and John were flying off to talk to Pedro in Madrid. I would really like Pedro... </p> <p>The rights duly reverted to me on July 10. The new option agreement with Night Hawk took effect. 9/11 happened in their sight, and I expressed my sympathy. They sent me videos of Almod\u00f3var's films. I watched them, then stuffed them in the overflowing cupboard of directors' films they had sent me over the past 15 years. </p> <p>In January 2002 - as Almod\u00f3var was wondering if he could tackle such a big theme, and starting to back off - a huge package was delivered to me. I found it was a writ, against Geisler, Roberdeau, Briarpatch Film Corporation, and me. One Gerard F Rubin, through his attorney Barry Goldin, was asking the Supreme Court of New York to hand the film rights to him. He, Rubin, was now Briarpatch Ltd, and claimed that he owned the Geisler/Roberdeau movie projects. The writ demanded of me that I should not claim the film rights had reverted. </p> <p>The assault was frivolous, Bobby and John assured me. A former investor with a grudge. He'd had one or two minor victories in the courts, in front of a judge who'd later been suspended. The next decent judge would see him off. I was not to worry. </p> <p>My instinct was simply to write to the court, stating the obvious. As a British writer of modest means, living in a small Cornish town, I could not afford to hire an expensive New York attorney to argue against a writ I considered outrageous. At worst, I thought, my nice homely local solicitor, Heather Hosking, who'd arranged a mortgage for me, could write to the court quoting the reversion clause, and end this nonsense straightaway. </p> <p>Geisler and Roberdeau soon disabused me of that idea: of course I needed an attorney! How touchingly innocent! Indeed, they had already appointed one on my behalf... Night Hawk would cover the cost. But naturally my attorney would have to work very closely with the legal team defending them. He who pays the piper... They sacked my first, painstaking attorney for overcharging. Or he asked to be allowed to withdraw because he had not been paid. The truth became increasingly elusive and ambiguous. </p> <p>This was almost three years ago. Attorneys for me appeared and disappeared, just like film directors. The White Hotel has become Bleak House, Jarndyce &amp; Jarndyce: an investor who felt defrauded of millions, and two determined men with a dream, fighting over my book. Pushkin wrote that, for inspiration, calm was more important to a writer than ecstasy. I felt angry that calm had been taken away from me. </p> <p>One day two summers ago the affair turned deadly. My writing was interrupted by a phonecall from Bobby, his voice almost unrecognisable, a griefstricken wail: \"Don, John is dead! He's dead!\" Roberdeau, 48 and a picture of health, had suddenly dropped dead of a heart attack in the lobby of the hotel where they lived. He had just been preparing packages to send to some 50 directors, urging them to reconsider taking on The White Hotel. I felt it was especially poignant that he had died in a hotel lobby. </p> <p>John Roberdeau's death was only part of a tragic sequence. In 1998 my wife Denise died of cancer aged 53. We had often fought, but - or rather and - she had been my irreplaceable muse for more than 30 years. The White Hotel, with its extremes of pleasure and pain, was drenched in her presence. At a similar young age, my agent's wife Margaret was diagnosed with a rapidly terminal cancer. It was all too much like the onrush of disasters in the first part of The White Hotel. It caused me to view the increasingly vicious legal battle in New York with a sense of unreality. As Lisa writes in her fantasy: \"For nothing in the white hotel but love / Is offered at a price we can afford.\" </p> <p>Prostrate with grief, Bobby Geisler felt like abandoning their dream. But then, in 2003, came a rare stroke of luck: David Cronenberg told him he would like to direct The White Hotel. He promised he wouldn't let Bobby down as he knew other directors had done. Not long after I was sent a fax of Cronenberg's signature on the contract. Finally it was going to happen! David was keen to start filming and already working on his own screenplay. </p> <p>Before I could fully savour the moment I had a phonecall from Bobby. In a flat voice he said: \"Two hours ago David Cronenberg signed to direct The White Hotel...\" I was about to interrupt, saying: \"Yes, I got your fax, isn't it great?\"; but he continued \" ...and I've just had a call from his lawyer withdrawing it.\" Goldin/Rubin had sent Cronenberg one of their huge tomes, heavy as the chains weighing down Marley's ghost, and not surprisingly it had frightened him off. </p> <p>I was now being sued for $4.2m. The specific sum - almost $4.2m more than I possess - intrigued me no less than what I could have done to deserve it. But at least Bernardo Bertolucci was interested again... \"It looks like we're making a deal for Bernardo to direct The White Hotel ,\" Bobby emailed. \"I think we still have a long road to walk, but we're headed in the right direction.\" </p> <p>The road ran out. Bertolucci pulled out of negotiations. Geisler sacked his attorney for alleged incompetence, then re-installed him. I did not hear from Geisler, or Myers, or Night Hawk, for several months, and wasn't even sure who was representing me in New York, despite repeated requests for information. I pleaded in vain for news from the western front. Both sides seemed bogged down in the mud, and the field phone-lines had been cut. </p> <p>Yet, after all, this is not the Somme. I've produced a new collection of verse, Dear Shadows , my first for more than a decade; and my first play, Hell Fire Corner, has been premiered. The blank computer screen continues to be a source of joy as well as anguish. One thing is certain: the imagined film is wonderful. It's fully worthy of the combined, unified, unegotistical genius of its directors Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, Hector Babenco, Emir Kusturica, Pedro Almod\u00f3var and David Cronenberg; employing the world's greatest cameramen and designers; the writing talent of Charles Mee, Dennis Potter, Joan Juliet Buck, Dusan Kovacevic, and even myself; the acting skills of Meryl Streep, Isabella Rossellini, Juliette Binoche, Nicole Kidman, Lena Olin, Emily Watson, Anthony Hopkins, Dustin Hoffman, Ralph Fiennes and many other brilliant actors; making us thrill at astonishing virtual reality effects, Showscan landscapes and glass fibre optics - but never cheaply or meretriciously, rather always serving the truth of my novel. I am hugely grateful for it. I never tire of seeing Lisa in the train, a blue lake outside, and hearing the first crashing chords of Don Giovanni... Or perhaps clowns tumbling in a circus ring, with Nazi officers gazing up at Lisa, swinging through the air. </p> <p>\u00a9 2004 DM Thomas DM Thomas's new verse collection, Dear Shadows, is available from <a href=\"http://www.falpublications.co.uk\">www.falpublications.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Only Human</strong><br> by Susie Boyt<br> 243pp, Review, \u00a316.99</p> <p> To this compulsively readable novel about mourning, Susie Boyt has brought an attentive observation gleaned from her work as a bereavement counsellor, linked with humour and an artist's compassionate sensibility. Boyt, daughter of Lucian, great-granddaughter of Sigmund, is a Freud without being a systematic freudian. Only Human is a sustained act of humane understanding. </p> <p>Marjorie, a marriage guidance counsellor, lost her husband 17 years ago after a bare two-and-a-half years of marriage which left her with a treasured baby, May, on whom she has thrown the weight of her own need. Sane and authoritative as she appears, Marjorie is secretly unhinged. The power of Boyt's remarkable novel lies in its discovery of a language capable of rendering a psyche utterly at a loss, behind the brittle screen of a public demeanour. I was reminded of George Eliot's observation in Middlemarch that \"behind the big mask and the speaking-trumpet, there must always be our poor little eyes peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less under anxious control\". For Marjorie's is an ordinary derangement. We have all been there, or somewhere nearby. </p> <p>The sessions in which Marjorie counsels her dysfunctional clients are sheer theatre. The novel's structure works in a rhythm of scenes in which couples perform the banal and bizarre dramas that display human nature at its most mad (and normal): he \"said I looked like a rat's abortion\", complains one wife. The husband deplores her failure to grasp his sense of humour. In another couple, the performative nature of the family dynamic takes the form of 10 minutes' hysterical sobbing in a \"sadness... so deep and high and sheer that Marjorie found herself regarding it with the highest admiration\". </p> <p>As it turns out, Marjorie is a lousy counsellor. Her investment in keeping couples together is a displacement of her own compulsion to clasp the dead Hugh, to hold herself together and not to notice how bereft she is. As Marjorie falls apart, so does her ability to continue her \"lively servicing of... old wounds\". Beautiful writing blends with inventive plot conceits, the most poignant of which is Marjorie's accidental detection under the bed of a 17-year-old Christmas stocking, packed with faded parcels: Hugh's present, as she thinks, to herself. She shoves it back under the bed. At the end of the novel, it is passed by mother to daughter, who begins to unpack the gifts, her inheritance of her father's love.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stevie Davies's latest book, Kith and Kin, is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.</p>",
  "It was only last month that the US army formally asserted that the abuse of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison consisted of \"aberrations\" that could not be put down to systemic problems. This week, however, two official reports have painted a more disturbing picture. The reports, one for the Pentagon chaired by the former defence secretary James Schlesinger, and the other for the US army by Generals George Fay and Anthony Jones, describe a situation in which the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners was more extensive than previously acknowledged and in which military leadership was found seriously wanting. <p>The abuses sadly bear repetition. Forced nudity was common, the generals' report confirms, and stemmed from the importation to Abu Ghraib of techniques used in Afghanistan and at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. \"They simply carried forward the use of nudity into the Iraqi theatre of operations,\" General Fay observes. Prisoners were frequently stripped and hooded, then left in extreme heat or cold for hours. One detainee was handcuffed naked and forced to crawl on his stomach as US soldiers urinated and spat on him; later he was sodomised. The importation process from Guantanamo also led to the use of dogs to frighten prisoners. In one case, US military personnel held an unmuzzled dog within inches of two naked and screaming teenage Iraqis and discussed whether the prisoners could be terrified into losing control of their bowels. </p> <p>These were acts of \"brutality and purposeless sadism\", Schlesinger says. The abuses continued for several months. They were not, the report stresses, \"just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards.\" Generals Fay and Jones confirm that. At least 34 US officers, including the two most senior figures in US military intelligence at Abu Ghraib, are implicated in at least 44 cases of recorded abuse over a period of at least six months, they found. Some of them took place during interrogations. \"There were a few instances where torture was being used,\" General Fay told a press conference this week. The causes of the culture of abuse were many, he said. They ranged from \"morally corrupt soldiers and civilians\" to lack of discipline at several levels and \"a failure or lack of leadership by multiple echelons\". Mr Schlesinger goes even further: \"institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels\" was involved, he found. The context of everything that happened at Abu Ghraib was the Pentagon's strategic error of assuming \"benign stability\" in post-invasion Iraq. The failure to anticipate a major insurgency, and to adapt when it occurred, were fundamental. </p> <p>The reports stop short of placing direct responsibility at the feet of the highest officials involved in Iraq strategy. But the cumulative effect of the two reports points clearly in that direction. It was not just individuals who failed. It was a system. Those who are in charge of that system cannot escape responsibility for abuses that debase not just the US but its allies, including Britain. But it is not just Donald Rumsfeld or George Bush who need to look into their souls. The same goes for a lot of Americans, and a lot of American men in particular. A Pew Center poll last week showed that 43% of all Americans, 48% of American men, 54% of American men aged under 50, and 58% of people intending to vote for Mr Bush in November believe that torture of suspected terrorists can \"often or sometimes\" be justified. The things that happened in Abu Ghraib happened because individual Americans broke the law. But they also happened because too many Americans are prepared to look in the other direction or even actively support such abuses. America is a society with a problem. That problem erupted in Abu Ghraib. America has begun to address it. But it must not slacken off now.</p>",

  "I've been here a week now, watching the city prepare for the Republican national convention and the accompanying protests. Much is predictable: tabloid hysteria about an anarchist siege; cops showing off their new crowd-control toys; fierce debates about whether the demonstrations will hurt the Republicans or inadvertently help them. <p>What surprises me is what isn't here: Najaf. It's nowhere to be found. Every day, US bombs and tanks move closer to the sacred Imam Ali shrine, reportedly damaging outer walls and sending shrapnel flying into the courtyard; every day children are killed in their homes as US soldiers inflict collective punishment on the holy city; every day, more bodies are disturbed as US marines stomp through the Valley of Peace cemetery, their boots slipping into graves as they use tombstones for cover. </p> <p>Sure, the fighting in Najaf makes the news, but not in any way connected to the election. Instead it's relegated to the status of a faraway intractable ethnic conflict, like Afghanistan, Sudan or Palestine. Even within the antiwar movement, the events in Najaf are barely visible. The \"handover\" has worked: Iraq is becoming somebody else's problem. It's true that war is at the centre of the election campaign - just not the one in Iraq. The talk is all of what happened on Swift boats 35 years ago, not what is being dropped out of US AC-130 gunships this week. </p> <p>But while Vietnam has taken up far too much space in this campaign already, I find myself thinking about the words of Vietnam veteran and novelist Tim O'Brien. In an interview for the 1980 documentary Vietnam: The 10,000 Day War, he said: \"My time in Vietnam is a memory of ignorance and I mean utter ignorance. I didn't know the language. I couldn't communicate with the Vietnamese except in pidgin English. I knew nothing about the culture of Vietnam. I knew nothing about the religions. I knew nothing about the village community. I knew nothing about the aims of the people, whether they were for the war or against the war ... No knowledge of what the enemy was after ... and I compensated for that ignorance in a whole bunch of ways, some evil ways. Blowing things up, burning huts as a frustration of being ignorant and not knowing where the enemy was.\" </p> <p>He could have been talking about Iraq today. When a foreign army invades a country about which it knows virtually nothing, there is plenty of deliberate brutality, but there is also the unintended barbarism of blind ignorance. It starts with cultural and religious slights: soldiers storming into a home without giving women a chance to cover their heads; army boots traipsing through mosques that have never been touched by the soles of shoes; a misunderstood hand signal at a checkpoint with deadly consequences. </p> <p>And now Najaf. It's not just that sacred burial sites are being desecrated with fresh blood; it's that Americans appear unaware of the depths of this offence, and the repercussions it will have for decades to come. The Imam Ali shrine is not a run-of-the-mill holy site; it's the Shia equivalent of the Sistine Chapel. Najaf is not just another Iraqi city, it is the city of the dead, where the cemeteries go on for ever, a place so sacred that every devout Shia dreams of being buried there. And Moqtada al-Sadr and his followers are not just another group of generic terrorists out to kill Americans: their opposition to the occupation represents the overwhelmingly mainstream sentiment in Iraq. Yes, if elected, Sadr would try to turn Iraq into a theocracy like Iran, but for now his demands are for direct elections and an end to foreign occupation. </p> <p>Compare O'Brien's humility with the cockiness of Glen Butler, a major in the marines whose August 23 New York Times article reads as if it were ghostwritten by Karl Rove. Butler brags that though he has been in Iraq for a month, he \"know[s] a bit about the caliph, about the five pillars and about Allah\". He explains that by swooping low over Najaf's cemeteries, he is not inflaming anti-US hatred but \"attacking the source of the threat\". He dismisses his enemies as foreign fighters and ex-Ba'athists and \"a few frustrated Iraqis who worry about Wal-Mart culture infringing on their neighbourhood\". </p> <p>It's hard to know where to begin. The Mahdi army that Butler is attacking is made up of Iraqi citizens, not foreigners. They are not Ba'athists: they were the most oppressed under Saddam's regime and cheered his overthrow. And they aren't worried that Wal-Mart is taking over their neighbourhood: they are enraged that they still lack electricity and sewage treatment, despite the billions pledged for reconstruction. </p> <p>Before Sadr's supporters began their uprising, they made their demands for elections and an end to occupation through sermons, peaceful protests and newspaper articles. US forces responded by shutting down their newspapers, firing on their demonstrations and bombing their neighbourhoods. It was only then that Mr Sadr went to war against the occupation. And every round fired out of Butler's helicopter doesn't make Des Moines and Santa Monica safer, as he claims. It makes the Mahdi army stronger. </p> <p>As I write, the plan for the convention demonstration seems to be to express general outrage about Iraq, to say \"no to war\" and \"no to the Bush agenda\". This is an important message, but it's not enough. We also need to hear specific demands to end the disastrous siege on Najaf, and unequivocal support for Iraqis who are desperate for democracy and an end to occupation. </p> <p>The US antiwar coalition, United for Peace and Justice states that \"there are two key moments this year when people throughout the United States will have the opportunity to send a resounding message of opposition to the Bush agenda: November 2, election day; and August 29, in New York City\". Sadly, this isn't the case: there is no chance for Bush's war agenda to be clearly rejected on election day because John Kerry is promising to continue, and even strengthen, the military occupation of Iraq. That means there is only one chance for Americans to express their wholehearted rejection of the ongoing war on Iraq: in the streets outside the Republican national convention. It's time to bring Najaf to New York. </p> <p> This column was first published in The Nation <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com\">www.thenation.com</a></p>",
  "The former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet yesterday lost what could be the final round in his tortuous struggle to avoid prosecution for human rights abuses. <p>In a surprise ruling, the country's supreme court ruled by nine votes to eight to uphold the decision of a lower court in May that stripped Mr Pinochet, 88, of immunity from prosecution. There can be no appeal against the ruling. </p> <p>\"The previous sentence ... of the appeals court ... is upheld,\" the court reporter, Juan Crist\u00f3bal Mera, told journalists at Santiago's main court. Outside, demonstrators including the families of the disappeared gathered to celebrate. </p> <p>The government indicated that the ruling could clear the way for an investigation, saying: \"Nobody is above the law.\" </p> <p>But a spokesman for the former ruler, retired General Guillermo Garin, said: \"This does come as a bit of a surprise since the health of the ex-president has not changed at all.\" </p> <p>Several medical reports have found Mr Pinochet to have a mild form of dementia. These reports, however, have been challenged. He uses a pacemaker, has diabetes and arthritis, and has had at least three mild strokes since 1998. </p> <p>As former head of state, Mr Pinochet had enjoyed immunity from prosecution, but that was challenged by prosecutors investigating a series of deaths and disappearances of political opponents of the former dictator in the mid-1970s. </p> <p>A report by the Chilean government estimated that more than 3,000 political opponents of the dictator were killed under his rule, which lasted from 1973, when he mounted a coup against president Salvador Allende, until 1990. </p> <p>The ruling is the latest in a series of cases that have stretched over the last six years, since a Spanish investigating judge attempted to try the former general in Spain. Mr Pinochet took refuge in Britain, where he remained under house arrest for 17 months before a medical opinion declared that he was unfit to stand trial, and he returned to Chile. </p> <p>He was stripped of his immunity before, when under investigation for killings in 1974 carried out by a group known as the \"caravan of death\". That ruling was dismissed on appeal on the basis that he was suffering from \"mild dementia\". </p> <p>But the opinion that he had dementia caused by a series of strokes was undermined by his apparent lucidity. Most recently he gave a lengthy and coherent interview to an anti-Castro television station based in Miami to mark the 30th anniversary of his coup. </p> <p>His standing in Chile has been further damaged by a US senate committee that found last month that he had $8m in secret offshore accounts. </p> <p>\"The discovery of secret bank accounts has finally toppled the image not only of Pinochet, but of the Chilean right and the Chilean army, who hoped to present his government as tough but honest,\" said Manuel Cabieses, the director of the Punto Final newspaper. </p> <p>\"It is clear that he is not going to prison or be punished, but there is no doubt that he remains a headache for the Chilean right,\" Mr Cabieses said. </p> <p>But Lorena Pizarro, who heads an association for relatives of victims of repression, told Reuters: \"Pinochet has to be tried. He must pay for all the crimes for which he is responsible. This has to be the window of opportunity [to] bring human rights violators to justice.\" </p> <p>There are more than 100 charges against Pinochet lodged with the courts relating to human rights abuses between 1973 and 1990.</p>",
  "<p>They came one wave after another: Shia demonstrators with banners and pictures of their ayatollahs and imams running towards the hidden line of men who were marked only by flying bullets.</p> <p>Beating their chests and shouting \"Allahu akbar\" (God is most great) at first they appeared not to realise the barrage they were confronting. </p> <p>When two or three men fell injured their colleagues picked them up and retreated. </p> <p>Only when the gunfire became heavy and bullets started whizzing overhead, peppering the electricity poles and shredding leaves on the trees did the reality of their predicament dawn. </p> <p>They were facing an onslaught. </p> <p>A few tried to restart the human waves shouting: \"If you denounce and betray your brothers today God will do the same on judgment day.\" </p> <p>But the number of injured just increased. Every few seconds a group of men carrying a body ran past looking for an ambulance. </p> <p>Many ran for cover, some grabbing the hands of their sons. More than 50 crouched in the front garden of one house sticking together against a wall. During any lull in the shooting they took their chance to scramble from one house to another and then to a back street where locals offered them water. </p> <p>Some of the demonstrators had turned out to welcome back Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, while others were there to show support for Moqtada al-Sadr. All were trying to reach the gold-domed shrine of Imam Ali. </p> <p>As the barrage faded, the divisions between the demonstrators began to appear. </p> <p>\"Why did you bring us here in the first place? This is a slaughter. If you knew this would happen why didn't you tell us to bring our weapons with us?\" said a man as he was tried to get some water from a tap in the street. </p> <p>\"It is all Sistani's fault,\" said Ali Mizahim. \"He told us to come here and he betrayed us again.\" </p> <p>A small group sat under a tree and attempted to grasp what had happened: \"We didn't come here for this. This is suicide. [Sistani] told us to wait,\" said Hussien al-Khafaji, a 50-year-old man from Hilla. </p> <p>\"What should we have done? Just wait to see our brothers being slaughtered in the shrine?\" asked a young man with a Moqtada badge on his chest. A man shouted: \"Withdraw - your brothers, the mujahideen, will take your revenge.\"</p>",
  "<p>More than 250 years after his death, Antonio Stradivari's violins and cellos are the best in the world.

They are the ultimate rebuke to the arrogance of the modern age: science does not have all the answers; renaissance technology still cannot be bettered.</p> <p>The Messiah is probably the most famous Stradivarius, celebrated for its almost impeccable condition. Its varnish is as flawless as when Stradivari applied the last drops in 1716. Such perfection, however, comes at a price: the Messiah has hardly been used; there are no famous performances in its history. If someone tuned it up now it would not sound terribly good - for reasons that are still not fully understood, violins have to be \"played in\" over several months or even years to develop their full tone. Nevertheless, its story is fascinating.</p> <p>The first notable point in the Messiah's biography is that it was unsold at its maker's death. Although by the end of his life Stradivari had accumulated a substantial stock of unsold instruments, almost all of them were later - and, arguably, lesser - examples of his work. </p> <p>The Messiah is from his \"golden period\", the first two decades of the 18th century, when it was all Stradivari could do to meet demand. Why the Messiah did not join the stream of instruments leaving his workshop is a mystery, and it was part of the legacy inherited by his eldest son and principal helper, Francesco. He only survived a few more years, and left the violin, with 100 others, to his youngest brother, Paolo, who liquidated his inheritance over a period of 30 years, selling the Messiah to a young nobleman, Count Cozio di Salabue, shortly before his own death in 1776.</p> <p>In the late 1820s, Count Cozio sold the violin to Luigi Tarisio, the son of an Italian peasant. Despite his humble origins, Tarisio would come to own more Strads than anyone apart from their maker. He had an obsession for them, and he fed it by travelling through Italy, playing the violin to support himself, and sniffing out treasures. </p> <p>On arrival in a village he would ingratiate himself with the locals to find out if anyone owned a violin, or he might visit monasteries and other likely prospects, offering to repair their instruments. Armed with information he could gauge the situation, perhaps simply buying cheap or, more subtly, offering new violins for old. Even if this resulted in no purchase, knowledge was still useful to him; and Tarisio became both expert and collector. </p> <p>He had the advantage, as later dealers noted ruefully, of coming across violins with their original labels; so he was able to build an accurate picture of different violin-makers' work. Those who bought from him were not always so lucky: he does not seem to have been averse to increasing an instrument's value with a little judicious forgery. </p> <p>Even those who realised what he did, however, did not think of him as crooked. If he had been seeking material gain, he would surely have lived a more luxurious lifestyle. In the words of Charles Reade, the Victorian novelist and occasional violin dealer: \"The man's whole soul was devoted to violins.\"</p> <p>Whatever Tarisio's motives, we should be grateful to him. Over 600 Strads still exist, more than half their maker's output. It's an impressive survival rate for such fragile objects, and we owe it to Tarisio, who recognised their value relatively early in their lives.</p> <p>Tarisio was more than a dealer, however: he hoarded violins. The best went straight into his collection, and none was better than the violin he had bought from Count Cozio, the Messiah. He would taunt other connoisseurs with its existence. It was on one such occasion that the violinist Jean-Delphin Alard said: \"Then your violin is like the Messiah: one always expects him but he never appears.\" The name would stick.</p> <p>Alard's father-in-law, the great violin-dealer, maker and copyist Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume, would eventually bring the Messiah into public view, but he had to wait for Tarisio to die first. The moment Vuillaume heard the news he scraped together as much money as he could and caught a train for Italy. </p> <p>For the next 20 years he would regale listeners with the story of his arrival at Tarisio's farm. The dead man's relatives were assembled there \"with every appearance of the most sordid poverty\". Vuillaume's enquiry for instruments was met with some disdain - most of the junk was in Milan, where Tarisio had died, surrounded by his collection, but half a dozen violins were at the farm.</p> <p>Guided by Tarisio's sister, Vuillaume bent down to a rickety piece of furniture. Inside he found five masterpieces, but it was the contents of the last violin case that took his breath away. Tarisio had been telling the truth: there was the Messiah, as perfect as the day it was hung up to dry.</p> <p>Vuillaume bought 150 instruments, including about two dozen Strads, from Tarisio's heirs. Over the next few years he sold on almost his entire purchase at huge profit, but kept the Messiah. Only Vuillaume's own death in 1875 broke the bond. </p> <p>There were whispers that this was an enchanted violin that kept its owners in its thrall. Various changes of ownership followed, but by the late 1920s the Messiah was in the hands of the Hill brothers, whose London dealership could eventually claim to have seen more Strads than Tarisio. They were determined that the Messiah should not leave the UK, and that it should not fall into the hands of anyone who wanted to do something so sacrilegious as play it. Refusing a blank cheque from Henry Ford, they placed the violin in Oxford's Ashmolean Museum.</p> <p>There the story might have ended - the Messiah still hangs in the Ashmolean - but for the sting in the tail. In the late 1990s a researcher with doubts about the violin's authenticity sent photographs of its front to a dendrochronologist. He measured widths of tree rings as they occurred in the wood's grain, compared them to an established reference series, and appeared to show that the relevant tree could not have been cut down before 1738, one year after Stradivari's death. </p> <p>The implications were enormous, and not just for the Messiah. If the most famous Stradivarius in the world were fake, how could any attribution to Stradivari be trusted? The labels in violins have been untrustworthy since the days of Tarisio. Violins can only be attributed through stylistic judgments, and it is the dealers who make them. The certificates they issue carry the weight when it comes to a violin's authenticity, and therefore value.</p> <p>With their reputations at risk, violin dealers closed ranks. They commissioned further dendrochronology that dated the Messiah's wood back to 1682, but there was controversy over the methodology. A scandal seemed about to break. All subsequent work, however, has verified the 1682 date. Moreover, there is a good cross-match between the wood in the Messiah and that in other Strads. Everything about the violin is consistent with its label, \"Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis Faciebat Anno 1716\".</p> <p>There remains the question of Stradivari's resistance to imitation. Vuillaume is counted among the best violin-makers of the 19th century. He took Strads apart so that he could reproduce every possible measurement, placed the Messiah and his copies of it side-by-side so visitors could guess which was which, and advertised that his violins would be as good as Stradivari's \"after a little use\". Yet nobody would now believe that claim. A compelling reason for refusing to attribute the Messiah to Vuillaume is that it is simply too good to be his work.</p> <p>These days, we can recognise the mistakes in Vuillaume's techniques; the best modern violin-makers do not repeat them. Many argue, in fact, that some of the instruments produced in the past 20 or 30 years do match Stradivari's. All they need is time to mature. Yet it's this need for a violin's wood to age - for perhaps 50 or 100 years - that shows the futility of attempts to imitate Stradivari.</p> <p>Perhaps his genius really is inimitable. But the violins Stradivari made are not perfect; they can be moody; they have off-days. Modern violin-makers benefit from the knowledge brought by history and science. It may need another genius, but surely one day someone will produce instruments that not only match Stradivari's, they supersede them.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Toby Faber's book, Stradivarius: Five Violins, One Cello and a Genius is published by Macmillan, price \u00a316.99.To order a copy for \u00a314.99 plus p&amp;p call the Guardian Book Service on 0870 836 0875.</p>",

  "There is a striking moment in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 when members of the Congressional Black Caucus petition Congress to re-examine the 2000 election results. One by one, African Americans from the lower chamber, the House of Representatives, approached the dais and explained that, in light of the large number of black voters who were turned away from the polls in Florida, the results were invalid. <p>In order to have their grievance tabled and discussed, they needed one senator to support them. The motion fell because not one of the 100 senators, two for each state in the union, was prepared to back them. Not one senator was black. </p> <p>Come November 3, that will change. For the first time in American history, both the main candidates in a senate race are black. In the election to replace the Republican senator Peter Fitzgerald, of Illinois, the Democrats are fielding Barack Obama, 43. His only gaffe during the Democratic party convention in Boston was to deliver a speech that was so well received that it threatened to overshadow John Kerry's. For the Republicans there is Alan Keyes, 54, an ultra-religious former ambassador to Unesco who stood in 2000 for the Republican presidential nomination. </p> <p>Given that only two black senators have ever been elected by popular vote, an all-black Senate race in a state that is 73% white is a significant moment. The fact that it should happen in Illinois, which markets itself as the Land of Lincoln, home of the American president credited with freeing the slaves, is greeted with a mixture of pride and feigned indifference. </p> <p>\"Well, it's about time,\" said DuWayne Thompson, an African American in the downstate town of Joliet. \"I don't know if white people have a problem with it. But they shouldn't. We have to choose between two white men for president every time and they don't complain.\" </p> <p>Many white people insist that they have barely noticed. \"I don't think it's important,\" says Cathy Harvey, filling up on petrol in the nearby town of Morris. \"We've moved on from that now. So long as they can represent the state well, I don't care what colour their skin is.\" </p> <p>Winning Illinois demands a tricky political balancing act at the best of times. Demographically, Cook County, home to Chicago and its sprawling suburbs, dominates the state. More than 40% of Illinois' population, and 75% of its African Americans, live in Cook County. </p> <p>The state is larger than England, but beyond the shadow of Chicago's skyline lies mostly farmland and prairie. Illinois' second biggest city, Rockford, would fit into Chicago 20 times. </p> <p>So a candidate cannot win Illinois without appealing to the cosmopolitan, more liberal and more diverse city; but they must also engage the more rural, white, socially conservative part of the state. </p> <p>When Mr Obama, formerly a state senator from Chicago, kicked off his campaign for the Democratic nomination, only about 50 people attended a launch party. \"At that stage it wasn't clear that he would even get the African-American vote,\" said one supporter who attended but did not wish to be named. </p> <p>On top of that he had a name that rhymed with Osama. Mr Obama used it to connect with crowds, calling himself \"the skinny kid with the funny name\" and telling the young: \"My name is Obama, not Yo Mama.\" </p> <p>Mr Obama was in a tight race to represent the Democrats against a wealthier, white candidate, Blair Hull, who spent $29m (\u00a316m) on his campaign and was backed by one of Chicago's most prominent black politicians, the former black panther Bobby Rush. </p> <p>\"At the beginning, a lot of people in the black community didn't think Obama was black enough,\" says Salim Muwakkil, a contributing editor for the radical magazine In These Times. \"He was bi-racial; he was Ivy League and he wasn't from Chicago. White people liked him so much, they didn't really trust him.\" </p> <p>Mr Hull's campaign imploded after unsealed divorce papers alleged he had struck his ex-wife and threatened to kill her. Mr Obama romped home, avoiding a runoff with 53% of the vote in the first round. </p> <p>By June, Mr Obama held a double-digit lead over the Republican challenger Jack Ryan, when Mr Ryan's campaign also collapsed. Previously sealed divorce papers revealed that he had tried to force his ex-wife to go to sex clubs and allow others to watch them have sex. After pressure from state Republicans, Mr Ryan dropped out, leaving them four months from polling day without a candidate. </p> <p>The Republicans had difficulty finding a contender so late. Then, this month, Mr Keyes said he had \"a moral obligation\" to run against Mr Obama's record on abortion, gun control and tax. </p> <p>\"Obama has never seen a spending bill he couldn't find some excuse for, and has never seen a tax increase he didn't like,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We needed to find another Harvard-educated African American who had some experience on the national political scene,\" the Republican legislator Steven Rauschenberger told the Los Angeles Times. \"We need that because the Democrats have made an icon out of Barack Obama. The only way to fight back is to find your own icon, and that is not going to be an easy thing to do.\" </p> <p>Critics say the Republicans' choice of Mr Keyes was cynical and tokenistic. \"They know they can't win so they are trying to bloody Obama,\" says Mr Muwakkil. </p> <p>Others disagree. \"Some people think the Republicans were trying to be cute by picking another black guy,\" says Tom Roeser, a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times. \"But the white establishment only ever picks one black guy to lead black America at any one time. The Democratic convention was Obama's coronation and now he's being groomed for the presidency. I think Alan wants to make it clear that Obama doesn't represent African Americans and there are more choices out there.\" </p> <p>Mr Keyes' brand of religious zealotry, maverick tendencies (last week he embraced reparations for slavery), and theatrical flourishes (he has branded Mr Obama's pro-choice stance as \"the slaveowner's position\"), does not play well in midwest heartlands. Nor do his Republican affiliation and anti-affirmative action stances please African Americans. </p> <p>At this stage the race is Mr Obama's to lose. A Chicago Tribune poll on Sunday gave him a 41-point lead, and 96% of the black vote. </p> <p>Even Mr Keyes' supporters concede that he has very little chance, but hope his candidacy may help shake up a moribund state party. </p> <p>\"I don't think Jack Ryan was going to win either,\" says Mr Roeser. </p> <p>\"But I think Alan is going to make Obama the issue. And given all the expectations there are now that he might be the first black president, I think Obama is the issue.\"</p>",

  "A hunter who shot a leading wildlife expert after mistaking his night-vision binoculars for a fox's eyes was cleared of assault yesterday. <p>Anthony Burns, 52, from Prestwood, Buckinghamshire, was out \"lamping\" for foxes late one night in April last year when he shot and seriously injured journalist Trevor Lawson, 37. </p> <p>Aylesbury crown court heard Mr Lawson had been looking for barn owls along a footpath through farmland near the village of Hyde Heath, Buckinghamshire, when he was shot in the chest with a hunting bullet designed to disintegrate inside the body of an animal to kill it more effectively. </p> <p>Although there was no suggestion Mr Burns shot Mr Lawson deliberately, prosecutor Neil Moore argued unsuccessfully that he had acted recklessly. </p> <p>But the jury believed Mr Burns when he said he had been \"100% sure\" he had been shooting a fox. The jury took just under two hours to unanimously clear him of causing grievous bodily harm. </p> <p>Mr Burns hugged family members, who were weeping for joy, after the verdict. His solicitor, Stephen Betts, said: \"He's just very grateful, it was a tragic accident.\" </p> <p>Mr Lawson was not in court and his wife left without commenting. </p> <p>But speaking by telephone later, Mr Lawson said: \"The verdict makes no difference to me in the sense that the damage is already done and it is massive damage.

This event is an example in lunacy.\"</p> <p> <strong>1650</strong> \"A bronze for Harland after starting 14th rather puts the mockers on Jon Cardy's point about the staggered start hindering stronger runners, don't you think?\" writes Adam Lawrence. \"I have a vague memory that Steph Cook came from miles back to win gold in Sydney too.\" Correct, Adam.</p> <p><strong>1645</strong> Australia will play USA in the final of the women's basketball after beating Brazil 88-75 in the last four. Grrr. Another potential Aussie gold.</p> <p><strong>1641</strong> \"I agree with Jon Cardy,\" writes Reno Pelekanou. \"The good events are over, so we now have to endure the fifth event of the pentathlon, which involves a load of people running around bouncy castles. Bring back Nordic toe wrestling!\" Don't knock the pentathlon, Reno. It has given Britain their only medal so far today.</p> <p><strong>1639</strong> If only Georgina had achieved a better result in the shooting. Still, that was an amazing run to end up with Britain's 11th bronze of these games. Kate Allenby finished well out of the medals. She was scuppered by a poor ride, having been second after three events.</p> <p><strong>1637</strong> Voros wins gold for Hungary, but Georgina Harland has picked up the bronze, which is quite an effort after finishing third-last in the shooting. Well done!</p> <p><strong>1635</strong> Harland is into bronze! She's running like the wind!</p> <p><strong>1634</strong> \"This staggered start thing is like Gladiators isn't it?\" asks Rowena Francis. \"They should install a travelator at the end of the track to spice it up a bit as well.\"</p> <p><strong>1632</strong> Harland has moved into seventh place, ahead of Allenby. She has an outside chance of winning a bronze. Come on Georgina!</p> <p><strong>1630</strong> Allenby is struggling a little, but Harland has almost caught up with her, despite conceding a 30-second lead. But these are early days in the 3km run.</p> <p><strong>1628</strong> \"This staggered start in the modern pentathlon is the stuff of nonsense,\" says Jon Cardy. \"It renders the fifth event almost pointless and penalises any competitor who might be an exceptional runner who had the misfortune to be given a lame horse or suffer a case of the nerves in the shooting. In fact, the whole modern pentathlon is utter nonsense and should be scrapped immediately. I suggest we replace it with staggered pie eating.\"</p> <p><strong>1626</strong> Kate Allenby crosses the starting line, just 20 seconds or so behind a group of four who currently occupy places 2-5. </p> <p><strong>1625</strong> The running race in the pentathlon operates on a staggered-start system, where the leader at the end of the fourth event - the riding - goes first, followed by the rest, in order, according to the amount of points they trailed the leader by. In other words, the first person to cross the line wins, which makes my life a little easier. And frankly, at 4.25 on a Friday afternoon, I can't ask for much more. The leader Voros has just set off - she'll have to have a shocker to throw away gold now.</p> <p><strong>1620</strong> \"Normally I can't stand Show Jumping but Ireland are in with a chance,\" says Darren Brimer. \"Joint first &amp; joint fourth at the moment - worth a mention!\"</p> <p> <strong>1618</strong> \"I think the Modern Pentathlon needs a revamp to appeal to The Kids,\" writes John Adams. \"What about a Post-modern Pentathlon to be the centrepiece of the London Olympic bid. Events would be Spitting, Swearing, Riding a bike on the pavement, Half hearted fighting and Legging it. I think Britain could sweep the medals.\" </p> <p><strong>1615</strong> The 3,000m cross-country in the women's modern pentathlon gets under way at 1620. Kate Allenby starts 1min 1sec behind the leader, Hungary's Voros, while Georgina Harland is a further 30 second behind.</p> <p><strong>1613</strong> \"Do the hares not traditionally lose to the tortoises?\" asks Claire MacLean, posing an interesting philosophical conundrum. I think that was just in Aesop's fables, Claire.</p> <p><strong>1610</strong> Germany have beaten Russia 21-15 in the semi-finals of the men's handball. They will play Croatia in the final.</p> <p><strong>1607</strong> Richard Noble is still optimistic of a medal in the women's pentathlon, where Kate Allenby is sixth and Georgina Harland is 14th going into the running - the last event. \"The British are usually among the hares in Modern Pentathlon,\" he reckons. The 3,000m cross-country race begins soon. </p> <p><strong>1605</strong> Nick Skelton is now in with a real chance of winning a medal in the individual show jumping after achieving one of only two clear rounds this afternoon. The next round starts at 2030. And to think he once broke his neck!</p> <p>\"I have noticed,\" writes Phil Tyrer, \"that commentators, when describing an athlete as 'tall', can't resist adding 'and rangy'. Dictionary.com says it means 'liable to move about, esp. cattle'. Not too flattering methinks.\"</p> <p> <strong>1558</strong> Liam Rooney asks whether Paula Radcliffe is \"definitely running the 8571 metres tonight?\" You guys! </p> <p><strong>1555</strong> I mentioned earlier that Leon Taylor came 11th in the diving. I forgot to say that another Briton, Peter Waterfield, qualified for tomorrow's semi-final in fourth.</p> <p><strong>1550</strong> Nick Skelton has gone clear in the show jumping. Very tidy indeed - and he leads. Plenty of riders to come, though.</p> <p><strong>1543</strong> \"No wonder Kate Allenby had a bad show jumping,\" writes Michael. \"Her horse 'Babar' is named after an Elephant. Doesn't really inspire confidence does it. Funny then that the Greek lass was riding a horse called Lucky Luke.\" </p> <p><strong>1536</strong> \"How does boxing work?\" says Andrew Goldsby, setting himself up for a comedy answer to Cynthia's earlier question. \"It's a formalisation of the more traditional events found in your average City Centre at 2330 on a Friday night without people telling everyone else to 'Leave it, he's not worth it'.\" </p> <p><strong>1528</strong> Leon Taylor of Britain finished 11th out of 33 in the men's 10m platform prelims in the diving. I'm guessing this is a good thing.</p> <p><strong>1525</strong> \"Please please explain how Khan has already got a bronze medal without having fought a semi-final match,\" pleads Cynthia. \"How does boxing work?\" It's really quite simple Cynthia: there is no third/fourth-place playoff, which means both losing semi-finalists automatically get a bronze. Yes, that means one gold, one silver and two bronzes. I think this is to spare the amateur boxes a further pummelling.</p> <p><strong>1520</strong> The IAAF have condemned the booing at last night's 200m final. \"The IAAF cannot approve any behaviour that is an obstacle to athletes' concentration,\" said the federation's General Secretary Istvan Gyulai. \"This was not an appropriate behaviour.\" </p> <p><strong>1515</strong> Just two fences down for Harland - including, agonisingly, the last. She lies 14th overall, with Allenby, I think, in sixth.</p> <p><strong>1514</strong> Georgina Harland is on the course.</p> <p><strong>1512</strong> \"Was anyone else staggered by the ineptitude of the chap in charge of the red and white flags during last night's men's long jump final?\" asks Nick Williamson. \"In the short space of time I was watching he gave two jumps as fouls, only to reverse his decision when the jumpers in question disputed the decisions - he literally raised the white flag in surrender. The second, by a Spanish athlete, was shown by the replay to be an obvious foul and must have left a large impression in the plasticine - the judge could probably have made out the imprint of a Nike logo had he made a closer examination.\" </p> <p><strong>1510</strong> Apparently the competitors in the women's modern pentathlon only get to meet their horse 20 minutes before the start of the riding, which strikes me as a bit of a lottery. Kate Allenby was stuck with a bit of a temperamental one - and down went the fences.</p>",
  "Sir Mark Thatcher's lawyer today claimed charges against his client were a \"showboating exercise to make a political point\", as Equatorial Guinea officially asked South Africa's permission to question the former prime minister's son over his role in the alleged coup plot. <p>This morning the government of Equatorial Guinea said it hoped to extradite Sir Mark, although no charges or arrest warrants have yet been issued in the country, which would normally be among the first steps in a legal extradition. </p> <p>This evening, Reuters news agency reported that a request had been received from Equatorial Guinea to question Sir Mark.</p> <p>However, the South African government has already said it would be unlikely to extradite Sir Mark, who is now under effective house arrest in Cape Town, since the equatorial state still operates the death penalty.</p> <p><b>'Nothing to hide'</b></p> <p>This morning Ron Wheeldon, a solicitor acting for Sir Mark, insisted that his client would be demonstrated to be innocent of the allegations.</p> <p>Mr Wheeldon also denied accusations that his client had his luggage packed and was ready to flee South Africa when he was arrested on Wednesday, and insisted he had \"nothing to hide\". </p> <p>Speaking from Johannesburg, Mr Wheeldon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Sir Mark would cooperate fully with the police investigation. </p> <p>Mr Wheeldon was also asked about suggestions that Sir Mark featured on the so-called \"Wonga List\" of those who invested money in the alleged coup plot. </p> <p>He said: \"Mark has no idea why he would be on that list, because he shouldn't be on that list.\" </p> <p>Mr Wheeldon was asked whether Sir Mark had ever had discussions with mercenary Simon Mann about investing in any of his schemes. </p> <p>He told the BBC: \"No, not at all. It is not the sort of thing that he would do. He is a public figure and he is quite an astute man, and it is not the sort of thing he would get involved in. </p> <p>Mr Wheeldon was pressed on whether it was true that at any point Sir Mark had offered or given money to Mr Mann or his associates for anything they might have been planning to do in Equatorial Guinea. He said: \"Absolutely not.\" </p> <p>He added: \"We would like it to be cleared up as soon as possible. </p> <p>\"We think that this is a political showboating exercise that is aimed at making a political point, rather than a criminal trial of Mark Thatcher. </p> <p>On Wednesday Sir Mark was charged with violating South Africa's anti-mercenary law in connection with the alleged coup attempt.</p> <p><b>'Mann found guilty in Zimbabwe'</b></p> <p>Earlier today, Sir Mark's friend and former neighbour, Simon Mann, was found guilty by a Zimbabwean court of attempting to buy arms for the alleged coup. No sentence has yet been passed, but he could face up to 10 years in jail. </p> <p>In another development, it was reported today that the elite South African police squad, the Scorpions, intend to question Jeffery Archer, the disgraced Tory peer and novelist, over the \u00a374,000 payment by a \"JH Archer\" into a Guernsey bank account linked to an alleged coup attempt.</p> <p>Lord Archer's initials are \"JH\", although his lawyers say he had \"no prior knowledge\" of the attempted coup.</p> <p> <b>Lady Thatcher returns home</b> </p> <p>Meanwhile, Sir Mark's mother, Lady Thatcher, arrived back in Britain from a lecture tour of the US, refusing to comment to reporters on the affair.</p> <p> Accompanied by six armed bodyguards, she returned to her London home this morning; Sir Mark's twin sister Carol, arrived there later, saying only: \"I don't know anything about it at all, I'm very sorry.\" </p> <p>Lady Thatcher, who is 78 and in failing health, had been speaking at the Jepson School of Leadership in Virginia, where she was the guest of honour at a dinner where other guests were instructed not to raise the matter of her son's situation. </p> <p>However, last night one of her closest advisers from her days as prime minister said she was \"obviously distressed\" over the affair. </p> <p>Lord Bell told Channel 4 News: \"She is very confident about the South African legal process and she is sure he will be cleared and named innocent at the end of it.\" </p> <p>Lord Bell, who is acting as Sir Mark's spokesman, dismissed claims that he was planning to flee South Africa when arrested. </p> <p>He also said he was unaware of claims that Sir Mark had received death threats from people linked to those already facing trial. He repeated Sir Mark's insistence that he had nothing to do with any coup.</p>",
  "<p>Vera Drake, the latest work from Mike Leigh, has been picked as the opening night movie at this year's London film festival. The decision at least suggests that the festival organisers are not scared of potential controversy. Vera Drake stars Imelda Staunton as a kindly back-street abortionist in 1950s London.</p> <p>The 48th Times BFI London film festival opens with Leigh's film on October 20, an earlier date than in past years. It closes with the British premiere of I Heart Huckabees. Written and directed by David O Russell (Three Kings, Flirtiing With Disaster), the film is an offbeat philosophical comedy about a pair of married detectives who motor around America solving existential mysteries. I Heart Huckabees stars Jude Law, Naomi Watts, Mark Wahlberg and Dustin Hoffman, and opens in the US on October 1.</p> <p> \"I'm delighted at the quality of both our opening and closing night films, and with how they chime with the rest of the festival's programme,\" said festival director Sandra Hebron. \"On the surface Vera Drake and I Heart Huckabees couldn't be less alike. But what Mike Leigh and David O Russell share, apart from their complete understanding of the art and craft of film-making, is humanism, clarity of vision and a desire to make films which make us think about the way we live.\"</p> <p>The 48th London film festival runs from October 20 - November 4. Full details of this year's schedule will be announced on September 15.</p>",

  "Iraqi police took control of the streets around Najaf's Imam Ali mosque today after rebel leader Moqtada al-Sadr ordered his fighters to lay down their arms in a peace deal brokered by Iraq's most revered Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. <p>Militants left the shrine - which they have used as a stronghold and refuge throughout their bloody three-week confrontation with a combined US-Iraqi force - and began turning in their weapons as tens of thousands of pilgrims celebrated the truce.</p> <p>Mr Sistani, who returned to his office in Najaf this week following medical treatment in Britain, persuaded Mr Sadr to accept a peace deal last night, after a day of violence in which 110 Iraqis were killed and 501 wounded. </p> <p>Al-Arabiya television said Mr Sadr's aides had handed the keys to the mosque to Mr Sistani after the rebel cleric called on his Mahdi army militia to disband and leave Najaf and nearby Kufa.</p> <p>\"To all my brothers in Mahdi Army ... you should leave Kufa and Najaf without your weapons, along with the peaceful masses,\" he said in a statement that was broadcast through speakers at the shrine early today.</p> <p>Within hours of the statement, Iraqi police began taking control of the area around the mosque, as envisaged under the deal, according to a Reuters correspondent. </p> <p>Dozens of militants could be seen following Mr Sadr's orders, piling their Kalashnikov rifles in front of his office and melting into the crowds of Shia worshippers who had flocked to the area after Mr Sistani's call for peace.</p> <p>Police blocked roads leading to the area and checked for weapons as the crowds streamed back out of the shrine. </p> <p>Many militants insisted, however, that they would hang on to their weapons for future uprisings. In one narrow alley, where there were no police checkpoints, men could be seen pushing carts full of machine guns and rocket launchers away from the site.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there was optimism among coalition forces. US army 1st lieutenant Chris Kent said that the peace agreement \"appears to be a final resolution. That's what it looks like right now.\" </p> <p>Mr Sistani's highly publicised, 11th-hour peace mission is likely to boost his already high prestige in Iraq, showing that only he has the political clout to force an accord between the coalition-backed government and the anti-US rebels.</p> <p>The five-point peace plan calls for Najaf and Kufa to become weapons-free cities, for all foreign forces to withdraw from Najaf, for police to be in charge of security, for the government to compensate those harmed by the fighting, and for a census to be taken to prepare for elections expected in the country by January. </p> <p>After the withdrawal of the militia, Iraqi police discovered at least 10 bodies in a building housing a religious court run by Mr Sadr's followers. </p> <p>Police sources said the dead - including an elderly woman - were summarily executed as a result of rulings by the court, which ordered arrests and meted out punishments outside of the mainstream religious and legal authorities. </p> <p>But a court official, who identified himself only as Hashim, told the Associated Press the corpses belonged to militants killed in the recent fighting in the city.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Iraq, the violence continued today as a car bomb exploded in the northern city of Mosul, wounding at least 10 Iraqi civilians. The US military said the blast, at 11am local time (0800 BST), appeared to be aimed at a US military convoy.</p> <p>In Baghdad, insurgents launched a series of grenade attacks on a US patrol, wounding 12 soldiers. Four suspects were detained in connection with the attacks, the US military said.</p> <p>US marines and Iraqi national guardsmen seized a large cache of weapons and bomb-making equipment in a raid on a house in al-Haswa, 25 miles south of Baghdad.</p> <p>Five suspects were arrested in the operation. Iraqi insurgents have repeatedly used al-Haswa as a base to launch attacks and detonate roadside bombs against US military convoys.</p>",

  "<p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC) today called for three new bank holidays a year to bring the UK in line with the rest of Europe.</p> <p>As England and Wales approach the last national bank holiday until December, the TUC has revealed the results of its online poll, which showed that the autumn half-term, the national Saints' days of England, Scotland and Wales and New Year's Eve are the most popular options for days off.</p> <p>Almost 20,000 people voted in the TUC online WorkSMART poll. Other suggestions for holidays included International Women's Day (March 8), Trafalgar Day (October 21) and Armistice Day (November 11). Only 1% of respondents thought the UK did not need any additional holidays.</p> <p>The UK enjoys eight bank holidays but the average for the rest of Europe is 11.35 days. Slovakia has the most, with 18 a year and only the Netherlands gives its workers as few as the UK.</p> <p>The TUC says employers are wrong to argue that the UK economy cannot support any additional days off each year. When the national legal minimum of four weeks' annual leave was introduced in 1998, the union estimated that the increase in days' holiday being taken was the equivalent of introducing 2.1 new bank holidays.</p> <p>But between 1997 and 1999, UK productivity increased by 4.6%, whilst the actual number of contracted hours worked fell by 0.7%.</p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, said: \"In the past, bosses have wildly exaggerated the costs of introducing more bank holidays, but our calculations suggest that the UK can well afford to bring in extra days. If we were all able to take a few extra days off work, rather than losing out, employers would benefit from less stressed, more contented, productive staff.</p> <p>\"The TUC welcomes Labour's policy forum decision that ministers are committed to change the law so that bank holidays are taken in addition to annual leave, as they are throughout the rest of Europe. But we want the government to go further and introduce three extra public holidays. It would be a real vote-winner.\"</p> <p>The long-running fire service pay dispute came to an abrupt end yesterday when the Employers' Organisation (EO) confirmed it would release money tied to reforms over bank holiday working and fire service modernisation.</p> <p>Overseen by the TUC, an agreement was reached on the sticking point of fire duties during bank holidays.</p>",

She knocks over the second fence. And the third.</p> <p><strong>1459</strong> \"While I agree with Tim Nelson's email I would also suggest that greece IS becoming a major competitor in world sport and certainly has hammered many European countries who are larger and wealthier (though perhaps I am biased in my views),\" writes Elena Papazoglou. </p> <p><strong>1455</strong> \"I am so bored,\" admits David Holme, \"that I have worked out the medal tallies and the EU wins hands down over the Commonwealth even if the US is included.

The EU is even further ahead in terms of minor medals too.\"</p> <p><strong>1452</strong> \"Forgive me if I'm digressing slightly,\" apologises Simon Graham, \"but in the midst of all the drug-taking shenanigans has anyone else noticed the fact that no one else has got anywhere near Michael Johnson's absurdly fast 200m world record of 19.32!\" I think Johnson has noticed it, Simon. On the radio before last night's final, he scoffed at the interviewer's question about anyone getting near his time. </p> <p> <strong>1446</strong> The show jumping is under way in the women's modern pentathlon. I'll bring you news of Kate Allenby and Georgina Harland as soon as I have it.</p> <p><strong>1443</strong> \"Surely we should applaud the Greek booing,\" says Tim Nelson. \"The stadiums have been empty and the events largely dull. I rush to the screen every time I hear of some scandal or, even better, judges altering the scores because the crowd won't stop booing. What does it matter if it was bad sportsmanship or not? (Cue angry e-mails). As for partisanship, it has a long history of tradition in the Olympics. Well, at least for the last two. After the behaviour of the American and Australian crowds in recent years, watching the Greeks go mad every time they look like winning something is both exhilirating and hilarious. And at least they aren't convinced they're still a major competitor in world sport.\"</p> <p><strong>1440</strong> \"It's a good job Amir Khan is fighting Serik Yeleuov tonight rather than Kindelan then,\" writes William Cook in response to Joe Cosgrove (1426). His fight, incidentally, is scheduled for some time between 1830 and 1900.</p> <p> <strong>1437</strong> \"I agree with Mike Johnson's sentiments,\" says Warren Brown, \"but I can see all sorts of problems. First, you tend to be allowed only three entrants per event - so just because all the former Soviet states have more than the USA, that might not be the case if they had reduced entrants. We could re-instate the British Empire but we still fall well short even after taking credit for all the Aussie Gold. The real question is what Canada is on these days - nothing, that's why they're crap and that's the answer. Stop the yanks and their drugs and we're all in with a chance of beating them.\"</p> <p><strong>1435</strong> \"Forget reforming the USSR, or having an EU Olympic team,\" writes John Jackson. \"If we have a Commonwealth team, especially if we invite the US to \"return to the fold\" (am sure they would jump at the chance), we could hammer the rest of the world hands down. Admittedly there would be no UK competitors making the team, but think of all the lottery funding that would save.\" </p> <p><strong>1426</strong> \"I don't want to rain on everyone's parade,\" writes Joe Cosgrove, clearly about to rain as everyone's parade, \"as Amir Khan looks a great prospect but all this national fervour being whipped up about the 17-yea-old from Bolton is ludicrous. Kindelan a mature 33 from Cuba is unbeaten in 5 years and has beaten Khan before and is highly likely to do so again.\" So there you have it: Khan for the bronze.</p> <p> <strong>1422</strong> \"If (and I know this is unlikely, but bear with me), the USSR suddenly decide to reform,\" writes Mike Johnson, \"purely for Olympic purposes, they should shoot to the top of the overall medal listings thereby pushing the USA back into second place. Worth suggesting to them, do you think?\" Absolutely.</p> <p><strong>1419</strong> Some wise words from Chryssi Tzanetou, another Greek. \"The reaction of the Greek crowd in the 200m last night should be treated as neither backing up the Kenteris case, nor ignoring the manner in which himself as well as the IOC and the Greek Olympic Committee handled the whole issue. It should however, put all those involved in determining the fortunes of global athletics in deep thoughts, since it gives a clear and straightforward message of doubt and disbelief about the way the use of drugs is dealt with by IOC. It is common knowledge (and hopefully not only to the Greek crowd in the stadium last night) that taking drugs to improve performance is the norm these days, but only a few athletes seem to pay for it while others don't! IOC needs to prove that they are really serious about tackling this issue holistically and not selectively. The danger is evident that in few years the Olympic Games will have nothing to do with fair competition, but rather be a spectacular commercial festivity exclusive to a number of 'professionals'. And who could blame the Greek crowd for having objections about that?\" </p> <p> <strong>1417</strong> USA have beaten Russia 66-62 in the semi-final of the women's basketball. </p> <p><strong>1416</strong> \"There's nothing happening at the Olympics is there?\" notes the eagle-eyed Warren Brown. \"Why not follow Glentoran instead? I have for over 30 years and while older people have fantastic tales of near victories over Benfica in the late 1960s I've witnessed nothing of note outside of occasional Irish League triumphs.

It is too embarassing. The few people who are getting on TV to apologise for them are getting a very rough ride. The problem is Kederis (he has the status in Greece of Becks) has been built up as a really big celebrity, and some people just cannot face the truth of it. There is a general feeling of victimisation as well. These are the factors which i think provoked that rather unacceptable display on thursday. Of course absurd celebrity cults are not the preserve of the Greece (and neither is the phenomenon of drug cheats), witness the column inches devoted to Paula's decision over the 10,000.\" </p> <p>Sean Dickinson has some helpful advice to dispense on an earlier problem: \"Ed Macs refusal of some charity shop grease single bargain buying-type conumdrum can easily be solved by listening carfully to the vinyl and finding out whether it is the original grease singles collection, or the modern special-edition c.august 26th 2004. If Ed was to put the vinyl to his ear (as you would a sea-shell at the beach) and hear a faint booing, he should snap it up instantly.\" </p> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> For the absolute life of me, I cannot find any results that don't include some initial round of Greco Roman wrestling, so I've going to fill this page with the following tosh until I do: Hot on the heels of the US Olympic edict to their athletes to show magnanimity and humility, comes javelin thrower Breaux Greer's stated desire to not just win gold but spear the Greek populace. \"If I won a gold medal and I didn't throw over 90m, I wouldn't be happy,\" he said. \"I want to do better for the event. I want to throw 200m here. I want to hit someone in the crowd.\" My thanks also to Louise Wright for sending me a picture link to the aforementioned housing estate in Stafford. All that's missing is the Gary Docherty cul-de-sac ...</p> <p><strong>1.35pm</strong> An official-looking copy of the medal table has just landed on my desk, and it has Great Britain comfortably poised at No.12, but why are we below South Korea? We have an equal amount of golds, they admittedly have two extra silver medals, but we are four bronze medals to the good, thus giving us a two-medal overall lead. If we are going to celebrate not winning then surely our four bronze trump their two silver. Anyone have the IOC's number? Meanwhile, Ed Mac is looking for a musical blessing. Can you give it to him? \"I just bought two Adam and the Ants singles for 25p (Stand and Deliver and Ant Rap) but declined what looked like all the singles from the Grease movie, similarly priced. Good or bad? \"</p> <p><strong>1.20pm</strong> Philippe Baudillon, France's head of the bid for the 2012 games in Paris, believes the reason they missed out on the 1992 Games was because they are perceived as arrogant (if you listen closely you can hear Brian Clough nodding). He said: Every nation in the world has a reputation. In France that is positive because of our culture but it can also be negative because the people can be seen as arrogant. I accept this kind of criticism and it's something I have to take into account.\"<br> Meanwhile, Jonathon Daniels has alerted us to a bizarre and completely unexplained link between a housing estate in Stafford and the BBC commentary team. Says Jonathon: \"My sister lives in Sue Barker Close, just off Steve Redgrave Drive, and near Linford Christie Avenue and Jonathan Edwards Drive. The builders were obviously lacking a bit of imagination as the estate also includes an Andy Cole Drive. Strange but true.\"</p> <p> <strong>1.10pm</strong> In the absence of any meaningful Olympic news happening at the minute, here's Tom Hopkins taking Kostas Pateras to task: \"I was implying no such thing about the Greek nation. All I was suggesting was that either 1. The UK media are giving an unbalanced view of events (not unlikely); or 2. Sections of the Greek media are doing likewise (as would, undoubtedly, The Sun et al in similar circumstances). I was not trying to suggest that any inaccurate media reporting would reflect on the Greek people as a whole any more than I would like to think that The Sun and the Daily Mail represent me. \"</p> <p> <strong>1258</strong> Kate Allenby is now second in the modern pentathlon with the riding and running to come. Georgina Harland has moved up to 19th. And now I'm off for lunch. Please send your emails to Rob Murray at <a href=\"-=\" mailto:bobby_murray@hotmail.com\">bobby_murray@hotmail.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>1253</strong> Good news from the swimming in the women's modern pentathlon, where Georgina Harland has finished second and Kate Allenby fifth. As soon as I know how this effects their overall standings, I shall let you know.</p> <p><strong>1247</strong> Here's Martin Reynolds. \"I believe there was an international restriction placed on the percentage of effort available after Keegan, as England manager, claimed our brave footballers would give 1000% in the second half of a particular match (I think we lost). This sudden escalation of effort caused a panic and raised parallels with the Superpower arms race. What would be the equivalent percentage of America's star wars programme. For this reason the limit was set at 110%. Athletes claiming 200% or 300% effort are clearly opening themselves up for investigation by the IOC.\"</p> <p><strong>1245</strong> Alexei Tichtchenko of Russia is through to the final of the 54-57kg boxing, after a comprehensive 45-25 win over Seok Hwan Jo of South Korea. </p> <p>\"I was in the stadium last night,\" writes Elwyn Evans, \"and like many in the crowd, thought the booing pretty silly. In fact, after a point, half the noise was coming from other Greeks suggesting that the boo-ers might like to shut up. But anyway it hardly ranks very highly in the scale of crowd misbehaviour, does it? If only English football fans always limited themselves to a spot of booing and chanting.\" I think that, between us, we're slowly arriving at the truth.</p> <p><strong>1240</strong> At last - a Greek perspective. Here's Kostas Pateras. \"I suppose Tom Hopkins thinks that Greece is a very primitive and backwards place,\" he writes. \"I can tell you that Kenteris and Thanou have been getting slaughtered in the media the last three weeks and that the behaviour of sections of the crowd last night did not go down very well here. I suspect the fact that not many of the UK journalists who are sent out to the games can speak Greek and are not really able to report accurately what the word is on Greek street. Kenteris is a fool. And he is going to get crucified.\" Interesting.</p> <p><strong>1234</strong> \"If what Flotsky says is true,\" writes Jennie Evans, \"then obviously the Greek sprinters do have something to hide. Even if there was suspicion cast over their coach, if they were innocent why would they miss taking a drugs test and risk exclusion from the games. The Greek crowd were completely out of order to do what they did last night, it was absolutely disgusting to hear them.\"</p> <p> <strong>1228</strong> Song Guk Kim of North Korea is through to the final of the men's 54-57kg boxing, after a 29-24 win over Vitali Tajbert of Germany.</p> <p>\"Snit is a perfectly normal word,\" seethes Louise Wright. \"It's in the dictionary as \"a state of agitated irritation\". My main problem with medal was that it seemed to be a lazy version of \"to get a medal\", but now I see it's older than that and am \"over it\" in your perilous modern usage. I'm perfectly happy with the evolutionary nature of language, but I do object to using it lazily when there's so many good words already. Oh, and I'm not I'm not southern. I'm from Derby. That's in the Midlands.\" So there.</p> <p><strong>1218</strong> More on the Greek booing debate. \"Right,\" says Flotsky, \"as far as I understand it, after Gatlin won the 100m, his coach admitted that he was the person who had anonymously sent a syringe to authorities in the States, which set off the whole chain of events that (handily for Gatlin) eliminated Dwayne Chambers and Tim Montgomery from competition. It also let to suspicion being pointed at the Greek coach and his runners. The Greek crowd appeared at first to be solely booing Gatlin and his team-mate Crawford, who is coached by the same chap.\"</p> <p> <strong>1213</strong> \"I was listening to FiveLive last night,\" admits Ben Hendy, \"and their take on the whole booing of the Americans by the Greeks was that they feel they (the Greeks) have been picked on by the IOC for the positive drug tests that have occurred and they reckon all the American athletes are taking drugs and there is a big cover up of it (because of all the information that's come out about past competitors). But surely no one could accuse the Yanks of corruption?\"</p> <p><strong>1210</strong> The final of the men's flyweight boxing division will be fought between Yuriorkis Gamboa of Cuba and Jerome Thomas of France. Congrats all round.</p> <p>\"What on earth is a snit?\" wonders Steven Graves. \"It sounds like some creature out of Lewis Carroll...is this a southern thing? And how can anyone using such a word get precious about the English Language? Language changes. Nouns can be verbs. After all, the moaners all emailed in to complain didn't they? Get over it.\"</p> <p><strong>1207</strong> Obscure results of the Olympics dept: Kazakhstan beating Egypt 15-7. In the men's water polo. To secure 11th spot.</p> <p>\"Using 'to medal' is pretty annoying,\" writes Ben Wild. \"Equally annoying is the endless atheletes who declare they're going to give 110, 200 or even once I heard 300 percent in effort. Everyone involved in the Olympics seems very keen on encouraging sport in the younger generation, how about encouraging a basic understanding of maths.\" Fair point, Ben. Fair point.</p> <p><strong>1204</strong> After the shooting and the fencing in the women's modern pentathlon, Kate Allenby lies sixth, 100 points behind the leader, Hungary's Zsuzsanna Voros. Georgina Harland is 26th out of 32, but with her best events to come. Which is a good job, quite frankly.</p> <p><strong>1201</strong> This Greek crowd story is really brewing up nicely. \"I've heard that Greek papers were filled two weeks ago with stories of IOC testers going to Crete to test US atheletes and then the US Olympic Team claiming they were terrorists and getting them jailed for the night to avoid US athletes being tested,\" claims Ben Wallis. \"There are all sorts of unsubstantiated rumours flying around Athens and the Greek media (but not appearing in UK media) which might explain why the Greeks feel aggrieved by the US atheletes and that Kederis has been singled out.\"</p> <p><strong>1159</strong> \"I thought the Greek crowd actually showing signs of life for anyone other than a Greek athlete was great last night in the 200m,\" says Paul Lofthouse. \"Steve Cram, in fine BBC tradition, (see also Barry Davies), was incredibly pompous in his condemnation of the crowd reaction.\" The thing is, Paul, the crowd <em>were</em> showing signs of life for a Greek athlete. It's just that he wasn't there.</p> <p><strong>1156</strong> Here's Tom Hopkins on last night's booing by Greek fans prior to men's 200m final. \"It was definitely my take that it was to do with the Greek Motorcyclist, who seems to have taken it as some kind of vindication (the man actually has no shame). The thing is, has the Greeks heard the same story we have they would surely be embarrassed by him, not supporting him. Has the Greek press been telling a completely different version of events?\" Very odd, wasn't it? </p> <p><strong>1154</strong> In the other classification matches in the men's hockey, India have beaten South Korea 5-2 to finish seventh, and Pakistan have defeated New Zealand 4-2 to claim fifth.</p> <p><strong>1150</strong> Just to clear up the 1145 entry - GB beat South Africa 4-3 on penalties after it finished 1-1 after extra time. Still, a win's a win's a win, isn't it?</p> <p>This is getting very erudite. \"Indeed the full version of the OED has two versions of the verb 'to medal',\" writes Charlie Wilson. \"A transitive version dating as far back as Byron in 1822 (usually referring to war medals), and the intransitive version employed by Colin and the Yanks, and recorded as far back as the Washington post in 1979. Just in case you were wondering...\"</p> <p><strong>1145</strong> Great Britain have beaten South Africa 5-4 in the men's hockey 9th/10th-place playoff. Well done them.</p> <p>\"If the modern pentathlon is based on military skills how did fencing become included?\" asks Andy Watson. \"Surely duelling disappeared after the Napoleonic war? Much more modern would be to use those rocket propelled grenade things everybody likes firing at the Americans.\" </p> <p><strong>1138</strong> \"Has no one had anything to say on the behaviour of the crowd last night at the start of the 200m final?\" writes Joy Clancy. \"BBC commentators really got on their high horse (which reminds me you've said nothing on the show jumping), adopted the high moral ground etc. etc. Does anyone know why the crowd seemed to pick out one of the Americans? (One would like to think it was also some anti-Iraq war protest but then why pick on one?).\" I thought they were just annoyed that Mr Kederis wasn't there, Joy. But I could be wrong.</p> <p><strong>1133</strong> Louise Wright sends in an email with the subject title \"Medal as a verb\". \"I was in a right snit about that one too,\" she rages, \"but then I looked it up on Dictionary.com yesterday and discovered Thackeray used so it's got a fair lineage. I like to think of Colin Jackson whipping through a chapter of Vanity Fair before he drops off at night.\" A nice image.</p> <p><strong>1130</strong> The swimming in the women's modern pentathlon begins at 1225, incidentally.</p> <p>\"The commentators seem particularly keen on the phrase 'it's a big ask',\" writes Paul Horgan. \"That makes no sense, unless they're referring to an ample posterior...\"</p> <p><strong>1125</strong> The better news is that both women did much better in the fencing - Allenby came third, and Harland is moving up the placings too, with her best events - riding, swimming and running - still to come. </p> <p><strong>1122</strong> Bad news after the shooting in the women's modern pentathlon, where we have two serious medal hopes. The world champion Georgina Harland has had a shocker, and finds herself 30th out of 32 competitors. Kate Allenby, who won a bronze in Sydney, is not much better in 19th.</p> <p>\"I'm wondering if anyone caught Clare Balding laughing into her nosebag last night at the standard of showjumping in the men's modern pentathlon,\" asks Luke Satchell. \"I was trying so hard to side with the 'athletes', but they were so bad it was impossible to do so. Surely a pre-requisite for entering the competition is actually being able to get the horse off the ground?\"</p> <p><strong>1118</strong> Tom Hopkins has a more romantic explanation for the genesis of the modern pentathlon. \"The events are supposed to follow a story, something along the lines of: a soldier fights in a war (shooting), has to ride his horse to find his sweetheart (show jumping), swim over a river (swimming), and fight a duel (fencing) before he gives up and runs away (running).\" Not sure about that last bit, mind. </p> <p><strong>1115</strong> Morning.

Far more succinct and far less fiddly for the old fingers.</p> <p>Here's Tim Reston. \"In answer to the query from Louisa Noble, whereas the \"old\" pentathlon, heptathlon, decathlon all are traditional athletics (running throwing, jumping - i.e. similar to the ancient Olympics), the modern pentathlon is supposed to test competitors in the \"modern\" skills of shooting, fencing, riding, running and swimming, i.e. to simulate the sort of skills an Army officer or superspy might have. James Bond would do pretty well, except that his strongest talents might necessiate the addition of a few more events, and be considered a bad influence on the young.\"</p> <p> <strong>11.05am</strong> It's goodbye from me, and hello from the very dapper Lawrence Booth.</p> <p><strong>10.55am</strong> Gunn-Rita Dahle takes gold and nearly loses his sunglasses at about the same time. As the commentator said, she is \"over the moon\". \"Silly names,\" says Billy Mills. \"The winner hands down has to be American swimmer Misty Hymen, surely?\"</p> <p><strong>10.52am</strong> Norway's Gunn-Rita Dahle is 43 seconds clear in the mountain biking and set to medal with gold. \"What is it with Olympic commentators and saying 'to medal'?\" ponders Catherine Hanley. \"There's a perfectly good noun there, you don't need to try and make it into a verb!\" Oops.</p> <p><strong>10.45am</strong> I'll be handing over to Lawrence Booth soon, who looks very dapper in his Cricket Writers' Club dinner garb. \"I'm now persona non grata in MY workplace because my scurrilous twin brother [see 10.05am] has been dissing (the radiant) Paula,\" fumes Tom Hopkins. \"Has anyone else (outside of Sunset Beach) suffered at the hands of an evil twin?\"</p> <p><strong>Silly names etc in the absence of any significant action</strong> \"Misty May, the American beach volleyball player deserves a mention,\" says Luke Satchell, \"as it is both a silly and mildly pornographic.\"</p> <p>\"Modern Pentathlon,\" muses Louisa Noble. \"So how did it come about then? Who decided on this seemingly odd set of events? Is there an ancient Pentathlon, and if so, what was the line-up of events then? Is there any logic to it? Anyone?\"</p> <p><strong>10.30am</strong> \"Is this what drug cheats have come to?\" says Ian Dodsworth. \"Drugging themselves up and still not getting past the semi-finals! Maybe he should ask for a refund from his chemist.\"</p> <p><strong>10.25am</strong> \"Just wondering if anyone else has been keeping track of the standings in the silliest name event,\" wonders Deb Cresswell. \"Until last night the strongest contender looked to be the Thai women's weightlifting champ, Thongsuk, but there is growing support for Australian diver Loudy Tourky, whose name caused a simultaneous cry of \"GOBBLE GOBBLE\" from all present when it appeared on my TV screen last night.\"</p> <p><strong>10.20am</strong> Russian 400m runner Anton Galkin is the latest Olympian to be thrown out of the Athens Games for a positive drugs test. The 25-year-old, who was eliminated at the semi-final stage, tested positive for stanozolol and will now be sent home instead of competing in the 4x400m relay as intended. </p> <p><strong>10.10am</strong> More drugs news: Hungarian Olympic hammer gold medallist Adrian Annus had to give a fresh urine sample to the IOC by 1000 or lose his gold medal. It looks as if, like a forgetful hack who forgot to get his August expenses in by last night, he missed the deadline.</p> <p><strong>10.05am</strong> China have won the semi-final 15-10 in the decider; they'll play Russia for the gold medal tomorrow. \"I innocently enquired of the women in the office whether anyone else is hoping [the radiant one] can double the comedy and start crying again,\" sniggers David Hopkins. \"Apparently, that's just me, and I am now persona non grata in the workplace.\" Quite right, too: cussing [the radiant] Paula should carry a custodial sentence and a public flogging, I reckon.</p> <p><strong>10am</strong> At the moment we have the volleyball semi-final between Cuba and China, which is 2-2, with China leading 10-5 in the decider. Here are the current modern pentathlon standings (after one event):<br> 1. Lean Dong (Chi) 1204 points <br> 2. Tatsiana Mazurkevich (Blr) 1144 <br> 3. Zsuzsanna Voros (Hun) 1120 <br> 18= Kate Allenby (Gbr) 964 <br> 30= Georgina Harland (Gbr) 868 <br></p> <p>\"Didn't Greg Louganis nearly go topless a few years ago in the diving?\" chuckles Dominic Jones. \"Sorry, it is a Friday morning...</p> <p><strong>9.50am</strong> \"All bets are off on the biggest-load-of-nonsense-spoken-in-an-interview award,\" says Luke Satchell, ripping a betting slip into 444 pieces for symbolic effect. \"Did anyone else catch one of our triathletes telling the reporter last night that he'd 'put all my cards on the bike', but had alas, 'failed to come up with the biscuit'?\" Brilliant.</p> <p><strong>Shameless plea</strong> Does anyone who lives in the E5 area fancy setting up a regular indoor football thing? Is there a sports centre anywhere that has said facilities? All I want is a friend.</p> <p><strong>[The radiant] Paula's running!!</strong> Paula Radcliffe will run in tonight's final, and I for one will shed a few tears whether she wins or finishes an anti-climactic seventh. It starts at 7.50pm.</p> <p><strong>9.30am</strong> \"Tell us about the mountain biking!\" screams Clare DuHeaume from Cardiff. Right you are: well, it's on, but it's hard to discern what's happening really. The course looks like an absolute brute, mind.</p> <p><strong>More bits culled clinically from the wires</strong> Neither Georgina Harland nor Kate Allenby made a particularly auspicious start to their Olympic medal quest in the modern pentathlon today. Harland, the world number one, finished the shooting stage 30th of 32 competitors with just 808 points, compared to the 1,204 of leader Lean Dong of China. Allenby fared rather better but came 19th with 964 overall points which translates into a one minute handicap on the final discipline, the cross-country run. </p> <p><strong>9.15am: Gerry Keaty from Prague's thwarted dream</strong> \"I was taking no notice yesterday evening of the ladies short board diving competition on the TV in the background, when I was suddenly forced to investigate. I heard the Eurosport commentator say about one of the divers that she was \"going topless\". I thought this might have been a new ruse to influence the judges. As you can imagine I scrambled to the TV to get a look, but unfortunately he probably realized what he had said and qualified it with a \"in the diving sense of course\", whatever that means. Shucks.\" What <em>does</em> that mean? Anyone? Anyone?</p> <p><strong>Update lifted hastily from the wires</strong> Great Britain's hopes of adding to their haul of 25 medals in the kayaking this morning were dashed in two finals at the Schinias Rowing Centre. Paul Darby-Dowman and Ian Wynne failed to medal in the final of the K2 1000m. The pair struggled to keep pace with the leaders and finished well down the field in seventh. </p> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Morning. I'm wet through. That's not supposed to be a lurid, Wild Things-style blast of early morning tittilation, just cold - and I mean cold - hard facts that put the shambles that will doubtless follow in its proper context.</p>",
  "<p> The Olympics are by far the best show I've done. My brief was to supply stage crew for the opening and closing ceremonies. My company, the Showforce group, only got the contract three weeks before the games began. In that time we had to find 400 people to assist on-site technicians. Under Greek law we had to register locally. I think I set the record in opening a Greek company, bank account and finding an accountant. It took two weeks, which I don't think has ever been done before. </p> <p>My initial impression was that nothing was going to work. I was shocked when I first walked into the stadium and saw that nothing was finished, and how casual everyone was about everything. They didn't do weekends or work late at night. It was like they didn't know of stress. But as the games got closer, it all came together. We may not understand it but that's how the Greeks work. </p> <p>I was last in Athens four years ago working on a musical production and it's totally different now. They've dressed it up brilliantly. We advertised in the local papers for people. Our biggest task was not just finding them but getting them accredited, given the security concerns. My main fear was that terrorists would infiltrate through my organisation. I was so worried I turned some people away. </p> <p>Working on the opening ceremony was the highlight of my career. But it was the hardest weekend of my life, transforming the stadium from a show space back into an athletics track. The closing ceremony is not so technical as the opener. But it's still a challenge because we've got just 16 hours to get ready from the last sports event. The Athens Olympics were something to mock. Now they're seen as an ugly duckling which grew into a beautiful swan.</p>",
  "<p>At a time of year when many teachers are facing the end of short-term summer contracts and looking around for pastures new, a rather timely question has been asked on the dogme list: \"What makes an ideal language school?\"</p> <p>Well, you might well ask, how about one that's offering work for a start? A contract that can keep a straight face (a contract of any sort), being paid on time (being paid at all). You still there? Not to mention the fact that pastures new may well mean Kazakhstan. And it's notoriously hard to check out the fine print of a job offer from a thousand miles.</p> <p>It all depends who you're asking, anyway. A school owner's ideal establishment will be the one that makes the most reliable money, in which case pleas for improved pay may fall on deaf ears. Not to mention the fact that school owners in this business can be anything from well-intentioned ex-teachers to career business people to outright gangsters. One of each and you'd have a dream team, but it's an unpredictable business.</p> <p>As for the students, well they want everything don't they? The cheapest classes, the best teachers. If only that wasn't what they were promised it would be less of a problem, but as selling oxymorons go, it packs 'em in.</p> <p>Interestingly, teachers and students often share the same expectations of an ideal language school, and what they say they want is resources. Exit polls, on the other hand, tell a different tale. What counts is the way we're treated. Students value their interaction with the teacher, while teachers value a dialogue with management.</p> <p>The ideal language school, therefore, needs to privilege this interaction wherever possible. It must be a school that talks, that is in constant dialogue with itself.</p> <p>If you're a manager, explain to your staff how the profit margin works and why there isn't enough money to fund a fleet of Ferraris - or, if you're a superior git and don't want to, retain their cynicism. If you're a teacher, don't just assume that your managers are out to fleece you - or, if you prefer, carp on about everything at the staff meetings until no one takes you seriously any more. Both sides need to find out as much as they can about the pressures that impact on the decision-making and mood of the other, if only for reasons of the purest self-interest.</p> <p>I say both sides because I do think different skills are demanded in teaching (a facilitative process, which requires endless patience and keeping faith with people who underperform) and managing (an executive process, which requires making judgments and ultimately losing patience with people who underperform). It's one reason why ex-teachers running their own schools often fail to break even, and why business people can come across as cold fish to teachers, who think they're talking a different language - they are.</p> <p>The managers lose the staffroom, and the staff lose the students.</p> <p>So I wasn't being entirely facetious when I talked about that dream team. A teacher to think laterally, a business person to think logically, and a gangster to deal with estate agents and the council.</p> <p>An ideal school gives as many people as possible the chance to learn as much as possible about different aspects of the business, and how they relate to and are affected by each other. The ideal classroom does the same with regard to language and needs to allow students to see as much of the language as possible at any given time, rather than a minimum.</p> <p>The Duke of Wellington came up with a famously pithy solution to the question of what to do with the sparrows that were threatening to overrun the Crystal Palace for the Great Exhibition of 1851: \"Sparrowhawks.\"</p> <p>In the same way, although lacking the duke's military pedigree, I would be terse in my own recommendations for the ideal language school. No photocopies, no teachers' desks, no vast investment in teachers' resources.</p> <p>No, no, no - you can tell what sort of teacher I am.</p> <p>On the positive side, comfortable classroom seats in the round, a transparent wage structure and an open policy on observation, with teachers learning in the place they can learn most - each other's lessons.</p> <p>The issue is one of challenging a received culture, not just tweaking the organisation: few of these suggestions are easily sold to teachers, who are, for example, understandably nervous about \"observation\" when this has always been linked to decision-making and a judgment of some kind, rather than learning and participation.</p> <p>On the whole, though, it sounds like a good recipe for the bottom line. So what's wrong with you, school owners? How come the nation's gold medal cheapskates aren't embracing dogme more enthusiastically?</p>",

  "<p>Every year, we wait with baited breath as the computers whir through the final calculations of the Guardian's annual boardroom pay survey. Will this be the year when directors' pay rises bear some resemblance to the sort of numbers normal mortals have to rub along on? </p> <p>Frankly, the bit about the waiting and the baited breath is a trifle exaggerated, because the whole notion of directors' pay rises bearing any relationship to the usual wage determinants - like available supplies of skill and talent, the rate of inflation, profits or just plain merit - is quaint, if not laughable. </p> <p>In Directorland, the good times have been rolling for years, despite successive governments calling for boardroom pay restraint and recent (hollow) threats of legislation if directors didn't do the honourable thing. Increasingly scientific methods are used to measure management performance on which bonuses are based and shareholders regularly say \"enough is enough\" when underperformers are over-rewarded. But it is never enough. So it was no surprise that our new survey showed boardroom pay up an average of 12.8% last year. OK, it is down on last year's 23% rise, but it is still nearly three times the 4.7% increase in UK average earnings (which dwindled to a much more recognisable 3.6% when the impact of the annual bonuses paid to a relative handful of City workers is excluded). </p> <p>The latest idea from shareholders is to force companies to detail ratios of directors' pay to their workforce average. The gap between chief executives and their underlings is widening rapidly - though is still tiny compared to US levels - and a bit of moral pressure, the National Association of Pension Funds seems to believe, would work wonders. Nice try guys. But don't hold your breath. The average chief executive now earns a whopping \u00a31.7m a year, even though his basic salary is a relatively paltry \u00a3581,000. (And we use the term \"his\" on purpose. It is a fact that should embarrass everyone that there are only 17 female executive directors among the country's top 100 companies). </p> <p>Of course, not every huge pay deal proves a problem. Take Tesco. The board is paid five times more than average and every one of the eight (male) full-time directors would need a wheelbarrow to carry home their wad. But who is complaining? Not the shoppers, benefiting from lower prices, not the workers in newly created jobs and not the shareholders. The ones that stick in the craw are the toe-curling payoffs that some still manage to secure. </p> <p>Step forward Michael Green, the former chairman of Carlton, shown the door by disgruntled shareholders after years of poor performance. Mr Green had no contract yet waltzed away from Carlton with \u00a39.4m and another vast sum heading his way next year. </p> <p>So why do boardroom salaries keep moving north? The remuneration committees point the finger at recruitment and retainment problems. It's not just that these jobs are tough. Who wants jumped up shareholders and pesky journalists poring over your performance? Why not opt for the quiet life in private equity and be paid far more? The remuneration consultants, meanwhile, blame executive salary demands on the trend for greater disclosure. With full details of every pay deal now revealed in annual reports and news- papers, they say, directors are bound to compare their own pay with their peers and rivals. They then demand parity - or more - and average pay is remorselessly cranked up. </p> <p>Where will it end? Not here and not yet. A tightknit industry has grown up advising companies on executive pay and it would be a brave consultant who suggested pay cuts to a non-exec on a remuneration committee if they also advise the company where that director works full time.</p>",
  "Cherie Booth's chambers, Matrix, are to draw up the document to impeach her husband, Tony Blair, for \"high crimes and misdemeanours\" in the run up to the war against Iraq, it was disclosed yesterday. <p>The 12 MPs planning to revive the ancient parliamentary procedure - last used 156 years ago against Lord Palmerston - have engaged his wife's chambers to frame the motion because of their record in taking up human rights issues. </p> <p>Two of Ms Booth's colleagues will be working on the motion. One, Rabinder Singh, is of equal status to the PM's wife, being a QC and a deputy high court judge. </p> <p>He recently brought a case arguing that the Iraq war breached international law. </p> <p>The other is Conor Gearty, professor of human rights at the London School of Economics and a founder partner of Matrix. He recently took a case against the Ministry of Defence over a personal injury claim. </p> <p>He is also an expert on terrorism, having written and contributed to books on the subject. </p> <p>Yesterday Elfyn Llwyd, leader of Plaid Cymru, a lawyer and one of the MPs bringing the impeachment, said: \"Matrix will not be doing this work on a pro bono basis, they will receive a full fee. Cherie Booth will of course will be ruled out as it would be a conflict of interest.\" </p> <p>Matrix Chambers said it was not making any comment about its work on the impeachment of one its member's spouses referring all calls to a public interest rights solicitor in Birmingham. </p> <p>The framing of the motion will be crucial to bringing the case. The aim is to put the motion on the parliamentary order paper and leave one MP to raise the matter with the Speaker. </p> <p>Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru MP who initiated the process, said: \"The precedent is absolutely clear that if one MP has expressed a desire to speak on an impeachment motion there has to be a debate. It would be unprecedented for there not to be a debate on an impeachment motion.\" </p> <p>It was disclosed that the House of Commons authorities have ruled that MPs can use public money - their researchers' allowances - to fund the impeachment process as it is a legitimate parliamentary procedure.</p>",
  "<p>A \"healthy bodies, healthy minds\" schools policy will play a \"very big\" part in the next Labour manifesto, the education secretary, Charles Clarke, said today. </p> <p>Following an announcement to prevent local authorities selling off their school playing fields, Mr Clarke confirmed he was discussing a set of measures on school sports with the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell. </p> <p>\"There's absolutely no question that parents want to see schools doing well academically. But they also want to have their children in healthy schools,\" he told EducationGuardian.co.uk. </p> <p>Mr Clarke admitted that the government had some way to go to meet a target of guaranteeing every child a minimum of two hours sports time a week. According to figures published in July, only 62% of schoolchildren spent two hours on sports. The government wants 75% to do so by 2006 and 85% by 2008.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that Mr Clarke was locked in a debate over a manifesto promise on school sports.</p> <p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, is believed to be backing plans that would see around half a billion pounds a year pumped into specialist sports training, a massive expansion in extra-curricular sports and, ultimately, the creation of sports leagues both within and between schools.</p> <p>But Mr Clarke was reported to be concerned about the practicalities of such an ambitious plan. The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers has already questioned the viability of the proposals in an already packed curriculum.</p> <p>Mr Clarke's comments came as he announced that the rules governing the sale of playing fields would be tightened, following increased concern that schools and local authorities were still cashing in on their open spaces despite changes to the law in 1998.</p> <p>He offered a three-pronged approach: local authorities will have to demonstrate that they have exhausted all other options before agreeing a sale, the proceeds will have to go towards improved outdoor facilities and those facilities will have to be sustainable for at least 10 years. </p> <p>Making the announcement at Langdon Community school in Newham, east London, the education secretary said: \"The old phrase 'healthy body, healthy minds' is true.\"</p> <p>He added: \"School playing fields will now not only be protected but also improved for the benefit of pupils and the wider community.\"</p> <p>Elsa Davies, head of the National Playing Fields Association, which has been critical of the government's policy, gave strong backing to the proposals. \"If there was even one hint of spin I would not be here and the NPFA name would not be attached,\" she said. </p> <p>However, she said her organisation would continue to speak out when schools continued to concrete over playing fields to provide new buildings, something which will not be protected in the new guidelines and, according to the NPFA, is on the increase.</p>",
  "The Israeli military has arrested two soldiers on suspicion of murdering an unarmed Palestinian, it was reported today. <p>Two more officers from the same platoon have been detained for allegedly attempting to cover up the killing, according to the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot. </p> <p>The paper said prosecutors accused the men of the \"deliberate shooting of an innocent man who was not behaving suspiciously\". Following a special hearing at the army's general staff headquarters in Tel Aviv yesterday, the suspects were remanded in custody. </p> <p>A military spokeswoman confirmed that suspects were remanded at the hearing \"regarding an incident involving the death of a Palestinian civilian in the Gaza Strip\". She said that no trial date had so far been set and refused to provide more details about the case. </p> <p>A soldier is currently on trial for manslaughter over the April 2003 killing of pro-Palestinian British activist Tom Hurndall and, in a separate case, an officer has been convicted of causing Palestinian deaths by negligence. </p> <p>The latest case, however, is understood to be the first since the September 2000 outbreak of Palestinian-Israeli fighting where the charge is murder. </p> <p>The paper said one of the suspects, urged on by the other, shot the man during military operations in the southern Gaza Strip last October, then told his superiors that he had shot a hostile gunman. </p> <p>Yediot Ahronot said a court order barred publication of further details of the case.</p> <p>In other developments in the region, Islamist militants said they would begin kidnapping Israeli troops and civilians in the occupied areas to highlight the plight of 2,600 hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.</p> <p>Apparently frustrated by the lack of international media coverage of the hunger strike - now in its 13th day - the armed wings of Fatah and Islamic Jihad announced the move in a bid to boost the prisoners' campaign, the Jerusalem Post reported.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UN's Middle East peace envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, urged Israeli prison authorities to ensure the wellbeing of the prisoners. </p> <p>A UN statement said Mr Roed-Larsen also called on both the Israelis and the prisoners to renew efforts to end their dispute over prison conditions and visiting rights. </p> <p>Among the strikers' demands are transfers to prisons along the borders between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip or in Israeli-held parts of the Palestinian areas, which would facilitate family visits. </p> <p>Most Palestinians are barred from entering Israel, making it impossible for prisoners' relatives to reach the prisons where they are held. </p> <p>The Israel Prisons' Service says it is holding about 4,000 Palestinian \"security prisoners\". </p> <p>Human rights organisations say that about half have been convicted while the rest are either awaiting trial, accused of varying degrees of involvement in hostilities toward Israel, or held under special regulations allowing internment without trial.</p>",

  "<p>Councils could face financial penalties over delayed discharges of mental health patients under plans being considered by the government.</p> <p>The Department of Health (DoH) proposals come just eight months after it launched a penalty scheme to curb the bed blocking of elderly patients.</p> <p>Under this system, local authorities are fined up to \u00a3120 a day for failing to put in place appropriate care packages within two full days of a hospital notifying social services that a patient requires an assessment before being discharged. </p> <p>The penalties were introduced to reduce the number of elderly patients who, despite being ready to leave hospital, 'bed block' because care provision has not been organised for them on discharge.</p> <p>Councils received \u00a3300m over two years to aid service provision for discharged patients.</p> <p>The DoH confirmed it now plans to extend the cross-charging scheme to mental health, community hospitals and palliative care, though details over when it will be launched and the level of resources that will be attached have yet to be decided.</p> <p>Bed blocking in mental health and community services was last year criticised in a report published by the House of Commons public accounts committee.</p> <p>In its response, the Treasury said \"there was nothing to prevent\" discharge penalties being extended to other care settings, although the scope of the original legislation on delayed discharge excluded mental health. </p> <p>Figures drawn from the DoH national beds inquiry found that up to half of all mental health patients may stay longer in acute beds than necessary because of a lack of suitable accommodation and support to live at home.</p> <p>A DoH spokeswoman said: \"There is an intention to extend the reimbursement system for delayed discharge to other settings if it will benefit patients. However we would need further parliamentary debate before extending to some settings such as mental health.\"</p> <p>Councils are firmly opposed to bed blocking fines, arguing that the scheme unfairly penalises the sector and prevents a better working partnership between health and social services.</p> <p>The Local Government Association (LGA) also claims that there is evidence to suggest that an increasing proportion of the delayed discharges can be attributed to the NHS. </p> <p>News that the scheme may now be extended to mental health was criticised by the LGA.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"In terms of extending this [penalisation scheme] to mental health, the causes of delays in mental health discharge are complex and cannot be solely attributed to local authority social services departments, particularly when research shows that causes of some delays seem to be due to a lack of NHS services. </p> <p>\"Mental health services have traditionally been under-resourced, and it would be unfair to introduce a measure which would further penalise a service which often doesn't get an adequate level of funding in the first place,\" she said.</p> <p>The LGA is due to conduct a joint survey with the NHS Confederation next month to determine the prevalence of bed blocking within mental health, prior to lobbying the government.</p>",
  "Last year some election watchers made a bold prediction that this presidential election would set a record: the first half billion dollar campaign in hard money alone. It turns out the projections were way too modest. <p>Here are the numbers so far. As of last month, according to the latest campaign finance data, George Bush has raised $243m, and spent $209m. John Kerry has raised $304m and spent $182m. </p> <p>According to federal election rules, the Kerry campaign can only spend another $75m between the day of his nomination and election day, capping his total at around 250 million. The $75m limit only applies to Bush once he accepts the nomination on September 2, allowing him to max out at around $325m. So the combined total of hard campaign dollars alone will crash through the half billion dollar mark. </p> <p>But that's before we even get to soft money contributions, where no caps apply. This year independent soft money organisations from both parties have so far spent $212m. The so-called 527s can keep raising and spending without limit through November 2, putting the country on track for its first billion dollar election - roughly double the money spent in 2000- itself a record year.</p> <p>The exponential rise of campaign dollars is ironically due to a piece of legislation that was supposed to shrink the obscene amount of money thrown at elections. The McCain-Feingold bill of 2002 had lofty intentions, some of which were realised.</p> <p>No longer can huge corporations write six or seven figure cheques directly to candidates in the expectation of a quid pro quo. The strict limits on individual contributions flowing to them has democratised that part of the campaign system. Witness the Howard Dean phenomenon where hundreds of thousands of people each gave two thousand dollars or less to create a popular bandwagon.</p> <p>However the very wealthy have exploited the yawning loophole in the law which allows unlimited money to flow to organisations independent of the campaigns, but working parallel to them. </p> <p>As these groups are forbidden by law to advocate for a particular candidate, they tend toward negative advertising. So not only has the McCain-Feingold bill failed to stop the flow of money to elections, it has resulted in much nastier campaigning. And when a campaign gets nasty that just encourages more spending. </p> <p>We entered the vortex of this spending spree about two weeks ago when an \"independent\" group began airing the infamous Swift Boat ad calling John Kerry's heroism in Vietnam a sham. Despite Kerry's initial reluctance to break into his campaign coffers in response, hard reality has prevailed, turning the traditionally quiet month of August from the lull before the storm to the storm before the storm. </p> <p>The fallout from the Swift Boat ad has been intructive for voters, because it exploded the fallacy that soft money organisations operate independently of hard money campaigns. This week Democrats pointed out that George Bush's senior campaign lawyer, Benjamin Ginsburg, had been advising \"Swift Boat Veterans for truth\", the group that financed the ad, forcing him to resign. </p> <p>But before Democrats get too righteous on this issue they should remember that a similar nexus of coordination exists on their side too. Jim Jordan - who until November last year was John Kerry's election campaign manager - is now strategising for the biggest independent slush fund of all on the Democratic side- the Media Fund.</p> <p>In fact Democrats caught onto the idea of the shadow election campaign much earlier than Republicans. The first nine of the top ten contributors to 527s this year are Democrats. Republicans are catching up fast, however. Carl Rove has sent the word out to big name visitors to New York next week that they will be expected to open their chequebooks in an effort to match if not dwarf the Democrats' war chest.</p> <p>All of which means that the electorate will be treated to an avalanche of campaign ads- most of them negative- between now and November. Will the important issues of the day be obscured by personal character attacks? Yes. But let's not pretend that any change in the finance laws would radically influence the level of political discourse for the better. </p> <p>The first amendment thankfully protects the rights of everyone to say pretty much what they like about anyone else. Voters are also free to draw their own conclusions, and if they think that a negative attack is unjustified they will punish the practitioner. </p> <p>In a free market, money is the most fungible commodity. The role of big money in the pursuit of the world's biggest political prize cannot be curtailed. But it hasn't diminished the role of the voter. They will get to decide which candidate's half a billion dollars was a worthwhile investment and whose was a colossal waste.</p> <p>\u0095 Philip James is a former senior Democratic party strategist</p>",
  "I should be dead by now; my twin brother is. You could say I am living on borrowed time, but I prefer to say I am blessed. <p>Decades ago, my mother committed the then unpardonable sin of giving birth to twins. To western couples, particularly those on IVF, the joy of multiple births is tempered only by recalculation of the household budget; to an Igbo parent in those days, however, there was only one outcome of bearing twins or triplets: the babies' instant death. </p> <p>There can be no greater contrast of cultural norms than the one between my life as a Nigerian in London and my Igbo upbringing </p> <p>I am from Imo state but my wife is from Okija, Anambra. The town hit the news earlier this month when 50 bodies and human remains were discovered in the latest ritual kiilling. Some of the victims were mummified but at least four had been killed recently.</p> <p>The international media were enthralled by the body count and tales of \"black\" magic. It had taken a common murderer fraudulently plying his trade as a dibia, or witchdoctor, no time at all to traduce the traditions of the Igbo people.</p> <p>The practice of worshipping idols is embedded in the culture. It was part of our ancestors' way of life for hundreds of years before the arrival of the white man and the Christian religion. </p> <p>Paganism, idol worship, consulting oracles: I have practised them all and seen many things in the process, though I am now a Christian.</p> <p>My father, the late Chief Ezeozue Akudinelu Amadiegwu, was an Igbo dibia and an outstanding herbalist. As a child, I witnessed the supernatural and the power of the oracles.</p> <p>When I was born, my people believed all multiple births, including twins, were for animals, not humans. Such births were therefore regarded as a curse and an abomination, and the sentence was that the babies must be slaughtered and thrown into the nearest \"bad bush\" - the forest of an oracle or shrine.</p> <p>I was a twin. There were no pregnancy scans available at the time so my mother had no idea she was expecting two boys. I came out of the womb first and everyone celebrated. </p> <p>My brother followed. He was quickly killed and disposed of to hide the fact that my mother had given birth to twins, and plans were immediately made for me to follow him to the grave. </p> <p>When multiple births happen, sacrificial rituals must be performed in order to appease the gods, and if the same woman were ever to deliver another set of twins, she and her siblings must surely die.</p> <p>My parents were forced into a plot to get rid of me by putting snuff into my nostrils. It was believed that the tobacco would cause me to sneeze violently until my brains exploded. </p> <p>My life was spared only by the intervention of a Christian missionary, Father Peter Onyebuagu, who was the head of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) church in my town, Nempi.</p> <p>He had heard of the plans to kill me and arrived the next day at my family home at about 6am, completely unannounced. </p> <p>Father Onyebuagu warned my parents that if they persisted with the plot, he would summon an entire garrison of the Nigerian army to come and shoot every member of the family involved in the plot. </p> <p>Whether or not he could actually do this I still do not know, but the threat of it was what spared my life. </p> <p>Father Onyebuagu then invited my mother and me to come and live with him, and it was there that I became a Christian.</p> <p>I was lucky to have been spared, but there were many others who were not so favoured: babies born with teeth - even a single tooth - were also sentenced to death, as were those who came out of the womb legs first. </p> <p>The bodies were thrown into the bad bush. This was the burial place for invalids, people who stole yam tubers (yam is considered sacred in the Igbo tradition), people with diseases such as oedema, chicken pox and small pox, suicide victims, and those killed by thunder or the oracles.</p> <p>As the son of a dibia, I soon became accustomed to sacrificial rituals and even took part in some of them.</p> <p>My father was known in many parts of the Igbo land, and many other witchdoctors and herbalists - even from the Yoruba and Hausa tribes - came to visit our home. Some stayed for months.</p> <p>People came from nearby towns and villages in search of cures to all kinds of afflictions: headaches, ulcers, fractures, gonorrhoea, malaria, chickenpox and many others. I saw male impotence alleviated; infertile women became pregnant and bore children.</p> <p>In order for these healings to occur, my father had to appease the relevant gods through sacrifice. Among these gods were Amadioha, the god of thunder, Chukwu Okike, the god of procreation, and Ulasi, the god of water.</p> <p>If the gods are not satisfied, it is believed, they will curse the people in the form of sicknesses, plagues, sudden deaths, madness and prolonged rains or droughts. </p> <p>The appeasement of the gods that my father took part in involved sacrificing only animals, including goats, rams and cows. All of these I have witnessed and known to be true. </p> <p>I remember as a young boy helping my father to treat a woman who had been barren for five years. I collected special herbs and leaves from the forest and pounded them into liquid form. </p> <p>Once the natural juice had been extracted from the potion, my father instructed the woman to drink it as fast as possible. Had she failed to do it quickly enough, the juice would have congealed and become impossible to swallow. The woman went on to have four children in six years.</p> <p>At times the gods may demand a sacrifice more precious than the life of an animal: a human life. This was a line that my father never crossed in all his years as a dibia. </p> <p>I have, however, met members of the Osuhs and Ohus peoples whose ancestors and families were sacrificed to the gods. These people are very similar in status to the untouchable caste in India.</p> <p>Although I have moved away from many of the traditions of my fathers, there are some that remain with me and that I hope to pass on to my own children.</p> <p>For example, Igbo tradition requires that before a couple who profess to be in love get married, the background of the potential family must be investigated. </p> <p>If the family are found to belong to the Osuhs or Ohus, they are immediately rejected and the marriage proposal is automatically annulled. This is also the case if there is a history of sudden deaths, madness or long-term illnesses such as MS, leprosy or sickle-cell anaemia. <br> </p> <p>Talkativeness (especially in women) and flirtatiousness are equally undesirable characteristics and further causes for rejection. </p> <p>Once the investigation is complete and the family has been cleared of all these traits, the couple receive the blessing of both families to proceed with the engagement. </p> <p>Yes, mumbo-jumbo - ogwu, otumokpo, juju, voodoo - really does exist in some Nigerian traditions </p> <p>I have lived through some of these things and I thank God that I am still here to tell the tale.</p>",

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>SISTANI BROKERS DEAL WITH SADR</b></p> <p>The Wrap suspects that if it were to raise a militia army and occupy St Paul's Cathedral in London for three weeks then it might have problems convincing authorities to allow it to walk free afterwards. There would probably be a bit of a fuss.</p> <p>But walking away a free man is apparently what the rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr will be allowed to do as part of a peace deal to end the siege at Najaf, the Iraqi holy city where his militia have been holed-up in the Imam Ali shrine.</p> <p>After more than three weeks of fighting between his militia and US and Iraqi government forces, the basis of a deal was reached at around midnight last night between Mr Sadr and the returning Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who cemented his status as Iraq's most powerful Shia cleric. </p> <p>Displaying what the Times called an \"awesome display of people power\", Mr Sistani led hundreds of thousands of his followers to the holy city yesterday, where he was returning after undergoing heart treatment in London. A convoy of some 1,000 vehicles followed the 73-year-old cleric's sports utility vehicle as it sped home. </p> <p>The Iraqi government appears willing to accept a peace initiative agreed in face-to-face talks between the two Shia clerics, the Guardian reports. It would involve Mr Sadr withdrawing his fighters from the Imam Ali shrine this morning.</p> <p>Under the plan, US and coalition forces would respond by pulling out of Najaf as soon as the prime minister, Ayad Allawi, gives the word. A government minister, Qasim Daoud, told reporters that Mr Sadr would then be \"as free as any Iraqi citizen to do whatever he likes\".</p> <p>The deal came as more lives were lost yesterday. The Sun and other papers report that 90 people were killed and 400 injured in Mahdi army gun and mortar attacks on the convoy in Najaf and nearby Kufa. It was a \"day of bloodshed\", the Telegraph says, and the Independent describes it as some of the worst violence to have taken place since the Najaf crisis began.</p> <p>Early today, too late for the newspapers, thousands of people were reported to be marching through the streets of Najaf and massing at the gold-domed shrine. Militia were reportedly still at the shrine, but without weapons.</p> <p>The Guardian sounds a note of caution, saying there was some scepticism last night as to how long the peace deal would last. Mr Sadr's first uprising against US occupation ended in June, only to resume again in early August, Luke Harding in Najaf points out. </p> <p>Even though something has finally happened to break the deadlock in Najaf, some of the newspapers show signs of being bored with the story; only the Times and the FT splashing on it. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1292093,00.html\">Najaf peace deal agreed</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1235440,00.html\">Times: Mahdi army 'disarms'</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/214d235e-f6cb-11d8-a879-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Najaf battle is struggle for leadership of Shia world</a></p> <p><b>SCORPIONS 'WANT TO INTERVIEW ARCHER'</b></p> <p>Members of the Scorpions, the South African police squad investigating claims that Sir Mark Thatcher was involved in a failed coup plot, are to fly to London to interview Lord Archer, the Daily Mail reports. </p> <p>Investigators have drawn up a so-called \"wonga\" list of individuals who are suspected of investing up to GBP100,000 \"for instant rewards when the government of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea was overthrown\", the paper says.

  "Michael Howard's political correctness speech was a classic of its kind. It should be put into a time capsule and preserved as the quintessence of conservative sentiment. But perhaps there's no need, since such a speech might be made at any time, a hundred years ago or no doubt a hundred years hence. <p>It was tribal, straight from a Tory heart to the heartlands of conservatism, touching every raw nerve, poking every prejudice and agitating every dearly held anxiety. How well he rattled the deep blue fear of the way we live now in a world forever plunging downward on the primrose path to the dogs. </p> <p>He's right to start the season with a great affirmation of political identity. Politics needs tribal definition, rooted in the great cultural divide that yawns within all societies. Politics loses its bearings without that defining struggle between the progressive, optimistic, change-welcoming side of the human psyche that is at permanent war with the alarmist pessimism that yearns for a better yesterday. Progressives think the world can be made better, while conservatives look backwards for inspiration, dreaming of imaginary golden ages of stability, security and sunlit summers when everyone knew their place and liked it. Ever since the ancients, the golden age has usually been set in each generation's grandparents' era; the dear, dead days just beyond modern recall. </p> <p>The phrase \"political correctness\" is a capacious portmanteau into which all modern conservative fears and dislikes are packed. Since no one on the left ever laid claim to it, in itself it is an empty, meaningless suitcase that signifies no more than the speaker's own reactionary political predilections. (Tessa Jowell and David Blunkett should know better than to borrow this alien Tory baggage.) Into it Howard packs his whole canon: big government meddling in people's lives; mollycoddling of children; hampering of police stop-and-search; bureaucrats and pen-pushers interfering; and the state as enemy to \"ordinary people\". \"Common sense\" and \"decency\" on a Tory tongue usually signify prejudice and ignorance. </p> <p>The hard content of his speech was a renewed assault on the Human Rights Act, which the Tories wrongly blame for an increase in people claiming (but rarely getting) new absurd rights. Now he opens another alarming battlefront against the Children Act, questioning its most fundamental tenet that children's welfare must always be paramount. He says it causes an \"imbalance between the rights of children and the legitimate rights of parents\" with \"the state interfering in the family unit in ways which do more harm than good\". Never mind that it was a Tory law, this reopens a deep political rift. The right always claims the sanctity of the family and the rights of parents (fathers mainly) behind closed doors; the left asserts that the state must go everywhere that defenceless children and women might need protection, statistically most often in the home. </p> <p>But he offered no statistics: it wasn't that kind of speech. Instead he reached for dog-eared anecdotes gleaned from the tabloids, some aged urban myths, some deliberately misreported court cases or just odd-ball stories. Remember, long ago, the charity that warned nursery teachers not to play musical chairs for fear of encouraging aggression? Since the charity had government money, he calls that old chestnut \"government-backed\" now. </p> <p>It is worth sifting through his political correctness anecdotage because its elegiac 1950s imagery is so telling. He presents us with a filigree-framed picture of cosy, rosy merrie England in peril, where staff are stopped from hanging out a St George's flag, a man is bound over for wielding a rolling pin, a pancake race is dropped for fear of litigation, while infants' sports days and Women's Institute sponge cakes are banned. </p> <p>But beneath this trivia there is a much nastier undertow. Careful lawyer that he is, Howard knows how to play delicately on every prejudice while giving himself deniability with get-out clauses. So he plants talismanic mentions of \"inappropriate nods to multiculturalism\" and refers to Tony Martin, who shot a boy burglar dead. He protests that the police are impeded in stopping and searching - when we all know whom they stop and search. He tells of the \"law-abiding majority\" suffering from rowdy teenagers on buses and the \"lack of respect, discipline and decent values\", all because \"we do not want to offend the politically correct brigade\". Shades of John Major here: \"Sometimes there is a limit to seeing the other person's point of view.\" </p> <p>This is where the limit comes to seeing his. For swathed in barely veiled code, this is a paean to the days when black people were in the colonies and the Black and White Minstrels on TV, when fathers ran families, the noose and the birch kept order, gays were in jail, the disabled in institutions and women at the sink. His careful caveats extol Britain now as a more tolerant nation than it was 50 years ago - yet every inch of that hard-fought tolerance had to be won in mortal combat with his intolerant party. Much of what he castigates as \"political correctness gone mad\" today will be the civilised standards of tomorrow. We grow more sensitive, more perceptive, more aware of others. We understand more the more educated we become - as polls show, graduates grow more liberal. </p> <p>The Conservative party may be going nowhere electorally, yet conservatism has never gone away. It remains the culturally dominant English voice (not Scottish or Welsh). Permeating everything, it is still the establishment. These values may not represent most people, but they are branded on the nation by the three-quarters of the press that pumps out raw conservative ideas daily. It's the same old culture of xenophobia that now finds its outlet in rabid anti-Europeanism. It's the same old tally-ho for punishment, not prevention. It's the deep-dyed English philistinism that still detests the modern and hails the ersatz and the pastiche over the shock of the new. All this is still culturally powerful, almost untouched by New Labour's seven years. </p> <p>Tony Blair and his closest imitators pander to it, to their shame. They dare not challenge these dominant public voices. Blair's pure Tory \"the end of the 60s liberal consensus on law and order\" last month was a crude obeisance to this climate. Labour may have persuaded people that a little more tax can yield better public services, but they have never really tried to shift the dead weight of the last conservative century's remains. Just as they have never dared touch the interests of the rich, powerful and propertied, so they have shied away from any taint of liberalism, tolerance or - God forbid - permissiveness. </p> <p>So while Labour tiptoes along in the conservative shadow, Howard can open the political season self-confidently with a tribal speech that sings to the conservative heart. Yet despite his electoral triumphs, Blair never plays the corresponding mood music that would rouse up his own tribe. So don't expect the resounding riposte that this \"political correctness\" farrago should get from Labour's leader. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Ministers must halt plans to abandon the ballot box in favour of all-postal voting for local elections after a string of problems marred a big experiment among a third of the electorate in recent local and European polls, a government watchdog warns today. <p>New legislation should be introduced to tighten up an \"archaic\" system and outlaw abuse with a new criminal offence of fraudulently completing a postal vote, it says. At the same time, individual voters should each be required to register for voting by signing a declaration of identity - rather than a household completing a form - to curb abuse. </p> <p>With tens of thousands of ballot papers going astray in the June 10 poll, printers unable to cope, and largely unsubstantiated allegations of fraud - compounded by widespread confusion among voters - the Electoral Commission implies that ministers did not think through the consequences of their actions. Privately it had already warned before the poll against such a widespread experiment. </p> <p>In a lengthy report which hints that the all-postal voting pilot in four regions could be seen as undermining the democratic process, the commission says that while turnout increased, public confidence was undermined. </p> <p>Problems which \"marred\" the conduct of the poll among 14 million electors in the north east, the north west, Yorkshire and the East Midlands ranged from a tight timescale - because parliament only approved the experiment at the eleventh hour - to the \"complexity of the voting method\", other logistical issues and reports of abuse. </p> <p>Nevertheless, a poll for the commission undertaken by the polling organisation MORI found that only 2% of voters had experience of fraud and malpractice - and of that number, the vast majority of claims were subsequently \"unfounded\" after investigation. </p> <p>Although a number of \"high profile\" allegations were made in the media, it says it is only aware of two leading to an arrest across Britain as a whole. \"Similarly, returning officers who have conducted 'integrity checks' after the close of poll report that no evidence of fraud or other irregularities have been found,\" it added. </p> <p>But amid growing concern the commission, which has previously supported scrapping the ballot box in local elections, says bluntly in the report that the strength of public feeling means that ... \"all-postal voting should no longer be pursued for use at UK elections\". </p> <p>Instead, a new model should be introduced providing \"choice, convenience, security and accessibility\" - in effect, a hybrid system - in which electors will have the option of going to the polling station and voting by post in a streamlined system. </p> <p>Although turnout in the four pilot regions, at 42.4%, was over five percentage points higher than in the rest of the country, the report says a \"significant minority\" of voters opposed all-postal ballots. </p> <p>Yet despite its detailed criticism, the watchdog says that an all-postal ballot involving 1.9 million electors in a north-east devolution referendum on November 4 should still go ahead because ... \"it would not be right to abandon the all-postal ballot at this stage.\" Last month the government scrapped plans for other referendums, to test the mood for elected regional assemblies, in the north west and Yorkshire. </p> <p>Tories last night seized on what they saw as an apparent inconsistency in the commission's approach. Caroline Spelman, the shadow secretary for local government and the regions, said the north-east referendum should be scrapped on the grounds that anti-fraud measures could not be introduced in time. </p> <p>\"This is a vote of no confidence in the government's handling of all-postal voting in the June elections,\" she added. \"The Electoral Commission cannot on the one hand say there should be a moratorium on all-postal elections and then suggest this should go ahead. The only safe option is to restore the tried and tested ballot box.\" </p> <p>But a senior commission official said later that they were now well prepared for the November 4 poll, with ballot packs on the point of being printed. Voters will begin to receive them on October 19. Commenting on the report's findings Sam Younger, chairman of the commission, said it remained committed to the goal of \"multi-channel elections\", giving voters various options of voting, provided security and confidence could be maintained. </p> <p>This would, he said, work towards a new era of 21st century democracy where electors could choose the method, day and time at which they voted. \"However, the law and policy supporting remote voting methods need further reform before secure and convenient elections can be delivered.\"</p> <p><b>Confusion, complaints and a headache for Labour</b><br> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Problems with printing delayed the delivery of ballot papers to many of the 14.8 million voters in the four pilot regions. This was mainly because contracts were awarded late and local returning officers were unsure about the mechanics of an operation only approved by parliament at the eleventh hour. One of the country's largest printers is said to have refused to take part because of fears that its reputation could be tarnished. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A late amendment from the House of Lords, in which an \"independent\" person had to witness a signature on a ballot paper, caused widespread confusion. The Electoral Reform Society said it was meaningless \"because anyone could fake a signature, and it is impossible to check\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> As a result of the confusion, with many complaining of complicated forms, a string of councils reintroduced ballot boxes late in the day at public libraries as \"collection points\" for postal forms. This caused considerable added expense in some cases. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Electoral Commission privately advised ministers against such a widespread experiment in postal voting. It said only the North East and the East Midlands were fully prepared, while the process in the North West, in particular, would be over complex because of the number of contests involved. The advice was ignored. The Liberal Democrats claimed the initiative was designed by ministers to increase turnout and give Labour an edge; traditionally, its supporters are more apathetic than others. If so, the plan failed miserably, with Labour suffering big losses. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Although there were allegations of electoral fraud, police in Greater Manchester and Lancashire said they were no greater than in previous years, when voting was through the ballot box and only a small minority resorted to postal balloting. But in the West Midlands, particularly Birmingham, allegations are being taken seriously. Postal vote applications in the city, which Labour lost after 20 years in control, are said to have risen from 24,000 to 70,000. Some councillors are calling for the election to be declared void in a petition to the high court.</p>",
  "<p>Telecoms watchdog Ofcom yesterday tried to relax BT's hold on the nation's network of phone lines by ordering a reduction of more than 70% in the price the company can charge its rivals to use them. </p> <p>The cuts, which are more severe than the reductions planned by BT, are designed to speed up the introduction of new services such as TV over phone lines and make it easier for internet service providers such as Wanadoo and AOL to enter the residential telephony market with innovative products. Known as local loop unbundling, the process of handing over control of the crucial connection between BT's local telephone exchanges and individual households has been painfully slow since it started more than two years ago. </p> <p>Of the 25m or so BT lines that connect houses and businesses to local exchanges, a mere 16,000 have so far been unbundled. Ofcom yesterday said it wants 1m lines unbundled by 2005-06. </p> <p>Many of BT's rivals believe that local loop unbundling is the best way to ensure long-term competition in the market. BT hands over ownership of the line and the new owner can collect the termination charge levied on inbound calls from other networks. </p> <p>In France, new entrant Free has used the economics of local loop unbundling to offer customers free local and national calls, more than 40 digital TV channels and broadband at four times the speed of services available in the UK, all for about \u00a320 a month. </p> <p>In May, BT said it would cut the cost of a shared unbundled line - where it retains some rights - by 70% and a fully unbundled line by 15%. </p> <p>Yesterday Ofcom ordered that the one-off connection charge for a shared unbundled line be reduced by 68% to \u00a337.03 by the end of the year and its annual rental be slashed 76% to \u00a312.64. </p> <p>For fully unbundled lines, Ofcom went even further than BT had wanted, demanding a 42% reduction in the one-off cost of transferring a line to \u00a350.70 and a 27% drop in the price BT can charge to install and then hand over a new line to \u00a3192.64. It will adjudicate on the cost of renting a fully unbundled line - currently \u00a3105 a year - next spring. </p> <p>BT said yesterday that the price reductions were slightly more than expected but that it would be able to work with them. James Waterworth, regulatory and government affairs manager at rival Telef\u00f3nica UK, added: \"This is another step in the right direction for internet service providers and their customers. Control over the local loop will allow Telef\u00f3nica UK to offer a richer broadband experience, including services such as voice and video.\" </p> <p>Ofcom yesterday also set the price for BT's Datastream product which many ISPs want to use to offer near-unbundled services. The United Kingdom Internet Federation, however, warned the price could leave \"a large number of ISPs ... in a position where they will be unable to compete\".</p>",
  "<p>Michael Green, the former chairman of Carlton, topped the league for \"golden goodbyes\" last year but left without fond farewells from his shareholders. </p> <p>Carlton investors had mounted a vigorous campaign to get rid of Mr Green and were pleased to see the back of him after a disappointing performance - but he still managed to walk away with a total salary package of \u00a39.4m. </p> <p>An explosive annual meeting last April saw investors vent their frustration at the board for the broadcaster's \"obscene\" largesse. </p> <p>Mr Green, who founded Carlton but fumbled issues such as the move into digital, was given a total payoff of \u00a315m. Much of this was handed over during the 2003 financial year, including long-term incentive payments worth \u00a36m. </p> <p>This was particularly controversial because Mr Green received the free shares under a change of control clause when Carlton merged with Granada - not because of Carlton's achievements. </p> <p>Sir Brian Pitman, the former chairman of Carlton's remuneration committee, insisted the payment had to be made as \"a matter of law, not of fairness\". </p> <p>Mr Green was not the only one to leave the television company with a handsome package.

His golden handshake was \u00a3889,000 and he will receive an annual pension of \u00a3404,000, while his colleague, human resources director Andy Smith, went with a \u00a3572,000 farewell. </p> <p>Others in the money include Philip Green, who left as chief operating officer of Reuters with a \u00a3834,000 package before sailing into the chief executive role at container shipping group Royal P&amp;O Nedlloyd.</p>",
  "With forecasters tentatively suggesting that the holiday weekend could be fine - or at least not as soggy as previous weeks - about 15 million trippers are expected to head for beaches during the three day break. <p>As the holiday rush begins, with travellers dicing with roadworks and closed railway lines, a survey reveals that Brighton remains the most popular resort, with Blackpool - now with an exhibition of human body parts to complement its other attractions - not far behind. </p> <p>A number of roadworks on major routes will be suspended over the period but some on key routes will stay, with the prospect of inevitable jams. </p> <p>Works near Heathrow and at Spaghetti Junction on the M6 in Birmingham are expected to cause delays and motorists will continue to make slow progress over the Thelwall viaduct on the M6 between Manchester and Liverpool. </p> <p>The AA advised drivers to prepare for delays even on roads without cones.

  "<p>Britain's men face the prospect of setting an unwanted Olympic record by failing to win a medal in athletics for the first time in the games' 108-year history. </p> <p>In every Olympics since they were revived in the Greek capital in 1896 a British male athlete has won at least one medal on the track or in the field. But with only three days left of these games the chances of this team maintaining that record are dwindling fast.</p> <p>That embarrassing prospect moved a step closer last night when Chris Tomlinson finished fifth in the long jump and Steve Backley only narrowly qualified for the final of the javelin.</p> <p>It would be harsh to declare Tomlinson a failure after he put together an outstanding series of jumps. He was briefly second after jumping 8.25 metres in the first round and four of his next five leaps were also beyond eight metres.</p> <p>The winner was Dwight Phillips, the American who added this title to the world championship gold he had won in Paris last year with his first jump of 8.59m.</p> <p>John Moffitt made it a US one-two when he improved his personal best by 18cm with a fifth-round leap of 8.47m, and Spain's Joan Lino Mart\u00ednez won bronze with 8.32m, also a personal best.</p> <p>But the results were the subject of a protest from Max Jones, the UK Athletics performance director, who claimed that Mart\u00ednez's best jump should have been a foul. The protest, however, was turned down.</p> <p>Backley is another athlete who deserves exemption from the worst-team tag. He has won a medal at every games since 1992. The Kent thrower, who is planning to retire after these games, only scraped into the final tomorrow as the last of the 12 qualifiers.</p> <p>Backley came close three times to the automatic qualifying standard in the first pool of throwers. But the 35-year-old was unable to reach the required distance of 81m - his first throw was 80.60m but he could only improve by 8cm in the second round and his last throw was 80.39m - and he finished sixth of 17 in his pool.</p> <p>His nemesis has usually been Jan Zelezny, the Czech who has won every Olympic title since 1992, with Backley claiming bronze in Spain and silver in Atlanta and Sydney. He qualified comfortably with his first throw.</p> <p>Chris Rawlinson, who was expected to challenge for a medal in the 400m hurdles, must have been a frustrated spectator as the Dominican Republic's F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez won the gold medal in 47.63sec. But Rawlinson, who finished last in his semi-final, would have been confident of beating Jamaica's Danny McFarlane and France's Naman Keita, the silver and bronze medallists.</p> <p>Sadly for Britain's men, the record books do not deal in what ifs.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Joe Calzaghe</strong> World Boxing Organisation super-middleweight champion </p> <p> The quarter-final was the first time I've watched him and I was well impressed with his skills and temperament. He has got a medal and whatever happens now that's tremendous. It could be the world senior champion against the world junior champion in the final and experience might decide it but anything can happen. It would be a bigger achievement than Audley Harrison's gold in Sydney because Amir's in a tougher weight division. </p> <p> <strong> Johnny Nelson</strong> WBO cruiserweight champion </p> <p> What he has achieved already is second to none. For a young kid of 17 to take all the pressure at being the nation's only boxing representative out there and do so well is tremendous. He's boxed with class and control and has the head of a seasoned professional. The Cuban will be a tough slog in the final but he can win it - he's boxing out of his skin. </p> <p> <strong> Chris Eubank</strong> Former WBO middleweight and super-middleweight champion </p> <p> He is an inspiration. This young boy has the potential to entertain me and that is all I ask. What he has done is a wonderful thing. But they need to keep his feet on the ground and keep him hungry. When you give a young fighter money you kill his potential and when you give him celebrity you kill his hunger. If you give a child too much he will end up no good and fighters are the same. </p> <p> <strong> Scott Harrison</strong> WBO featherweight champion </p> <p> Amir can go all the way and win the gold medal. Although he's only 17 he has shown the skill and confidence to handle the pressure of the Olympics and the media attention. His confidence will be sky high after his last performance when he stopped the Korean and he has the support of the whole country behind him. </p> <p> <strong> Jim McDonnell</strong> Trainer and former European super-featherweight champion </p> <p> He's a young kid on a holiday enjoying his boxing - no nerves or fear factor. Everyone's talking about him and that's a huge shot in the arm for the sport. An Olympic medal of any description at just 17 is the most miraculous thing I've seen in amateur boxing. He'll probably end up with silver but whatever happens he's a massive winner. </p> <p> <strong> Jane Couch</strong> IWBF and NABW world light- welterweight champion </p> <p> He's been brilliant. To beat the European champion was fantastic. He has a tough job if he meets the Cuban but he can win. He's younger, faster, and good on his feet. He's had it tougher than Audley Harrison - his bronze is worth more than Audley's gold. As a fellow Lancashire fighter, I'll be rooting for him. </p>",
  "<p>When athletes are in form they talk about being \"in the zone\" - a place where seemingly nothing can disturb the inner peace they feel because mind and body have come together in perfect harmony. </p> <p>It usually happens only for a short period in any career and, after years of frustration caused by injuries and bad luck, Kelly Holmes must hardly believe that she finds herself there during an Olympics. </p> <p>A week that started with her winning the 800 metres looks increasinglyas if it is going to end with her achieving something that Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram never managed, completing the 800m-1500m double. </p> <p>Holmes, 34, qualified for the final with such ease in the semi-final last night it must have seriously demoralised the confidence of her rivals. She sat at the back of the field for most of the race before she started moving up on the last lap. Coming down the home straight there was a frantic rush to grab one of the five automatic spots. </p> <p>The exception was Holmes, who loped past the rest with the air of a woman doing a session of training strides. She was content to ease off the accelerator in the final metres when she reached the shoulder of Russia's Natalya Yevdokimova, who finished ahead of the Briton by 0.11sec in 4min 04.66sec. </p> <p>The former army sergeant has been playing mind games with herself to keep focused after her brilliant triumph on Monday. \"I had a tough heat so I had to concentrate,\" said Holmes. \"I have to pretend I didn't win 800m gold so that I can concentrate on the 1500m.\" </p> <p>That, of course, is easier said than done. \"My gold medal is on my bed in my room and I keep stroking it,\" she said. \"It will be worn out by the time I get home. I'm trying to forget I've got it, but it's obviously very hard.\" </p> <p>Just as Coe had predicted, having a day off on Wednesday actually made it harder for Holmes. \"It was hard to get motivated because I had a rest day when I really relaxed so I had to refocus and it was a hard semi-final,\" she said. </p> <p>\"I've already got more than I expected so I am trying to keep myself down on a level and refocus for this event and it's hard to keep that motivation going. I don't know what to expect any more. I'm just running each race and I'll take what comes.\" </p> <p>Olga Yegorova, who on paper should be Holmes's main challenger as she leads this year's world rankings, has so far looked unimpressive and only scraped into the final tomorrow as a fastest loser. </p> <p>Swansea's Hayley Tullett, the 2003 world bronze medallist, finished 11th in her semi-final and failed to qualify in a race won by Maria Cioncan, of Romania. </p> <p>\"When you're in the final you have to respect every athlete,\" said Holmes. \"My coach and I will go through the tapes and see who looks strong and decide our tactics from there.\" </p> <p>Holmes's attempt to become the first Briton since Albert Hill in 1920 to compete the classic middle-distance double is being aided in an unusual way by Sally Gunnell. </p> <p>Gunnell, the last British woman before Holmes to win an Olympic track title, who is now the trackside interviewer for BBC TV here, is giving her a bag of cashew nuts after each race to help her body recover quicker. </p> <p>\"They are my little secret,\" she said. \"It's all about recovering as soon as possible, so I said to Sally after my 800m heats 'bring me a bag of nuts', and I've been stuffing them in my mouth as I've been doing interviews.\" </p> <p>Whereas Holmes has been among the most visible of athletes at these games, Marion Jones has been forced to keep a low profile after being picked for only one individual event by the United States. </p> <p>She qualified for the final of the long jump on Wednesday evening and last night ran the second leg as the US comfortably won their 4x100m semi-final.</p>",
  "<p>This was supposed to have been the night when Kostas Kederis restored Greece to its rightful place in the sporting pantheon. The 77,000 seats in the Olympic Stadium had been sold out in double-quick time to Greeks hoping to see the man from Lesbos retain the 200 metres title he won so surprisingly in Sydney. </p> <p>His failure to keep an appointment with the dope-test squad two weeks ago, and his consequent withdrawal, appeared to have made him a martyr to the thousands who came to the stadium last night equipped with blue and white flags and a simmering resentment.</p> <p>They booed and whistled when the Kederis-less field was announced, and their chant of \"Hellas!\" delayed the start for five minutes despite entreaties from the announcer.</p> <p>When the gun finally went, after one false start, Shawn Crawford of the United States took Kederis's crown, leading home his team-mates Bernard Williams and Justin Gatlin in the second US clean sweep of a men's sprint final this week, following Monday's 400m. Only a silver medal for Francis Obikwelu of Portugal in the 100m denied the US a sweep of sweeps in the three individual sprints. Asafa Powell of Jamaica, who came to Athens as one of the favourites, failed to make the start last night. Crawford ran a personal best of 19.79sec, and Gatlin was unable to become the sixth US sprinter to achieve the 100-200 double.</p> <p>From the disgrace of Ben Johnson in Seoul to the withdrawal of Kederis and Ekaterini Thanou, the once glamorous business of Olympic sprinting has endured 16 years of steadily diminishing public esteem. The freakish world records set by Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988, Linford Christie's two positive tests, the Balco inquiry and the tarnishing of the reputations of Tim Montgomery, the 100m world record holder, and Marion Jones, his triple-gold partner, have all contributed to a pervasive cynicism concerning the achievements of the world's fastest human beings.</p> <p>In this the United States has set the tone, and the behaviour of their sprinters in recent years played a major role in accelerating the decline. Maurice Greene's wordless displays of bragadoccio and Jon Drummond's tantrums were merely the most obvious symptoms of a syndrome that led the US authorities to order the team as a whole not to indulge in exces sive celebrations in Athens. No doubt the message was aimed primarily at the sprinters.</p> <p>All this came as a sadness to anyone reared on tales of the dignity of Jesse Owens in Berlin, and on black and white television images of the Tennessee Tigerbelles, led by the immortal Wilma Rudolph, speeding to victory in the 4x100m relay in Rome. The antics of Greene and Drummond and their colleagues seemed an insult to the precious memory of Owens, Rudolph, Bob Hayes and Wyomia Tyus. When Tommie Smith and John Carlos made their proud and valiant protest in Mexico City in the turbulent year of 1968, they put the US sprint squad in the vanguard of social change. The pampered and preening bunch of recent years give the impression of being interested only in themselves.</p> <p>There have been signs of an improvement in recent days. Allyson Felix, an 18-year-old prodigy who graduated from high school this summer, took silver in Wednesday's women's 200m final in a way that suggested she will be a force to reckon with in all the sprint events in Beijing and beyond.</p> <p>Her coach's words, too, were heartening. \"There's a lot of work ahead,\" said the 60-year-old Pat Connoll. \"It takes time, especially if you're a woman and you're going to do it naturally.\"</p> <p>Dangerous to draw conclusions, of course, but the slender 9st frame of the 5ft 6in Felix looks very much like the product of doing it naturally. Born in Los Angeles to an elementary school teacher and an ordained minister who teaches New Testament Greek at a seminary in Sun Valley, Idaho, she has been a hot property for a couple of years. A six-figure deal with a shoe manufacturer includes her tuition fees at the University of Southern California.</p> <p>On Monday the stadium witnessed the birth of another, less heralded star when Jeremy Wariner, a 20-year-old Texan, led a US 1-2-3 in the 400m. Two things made Wariner's performance remarkable. The first was that he is the first white man to win the Olympic gold medal at this distance in a non-boycotted games since Mike Larrabee in 1964, something that was treated with relaxed humour and common sense by Otis Harris and Derrick Brew, the two African Americans who followed him home. \"Race has got nothing to do with it,\" Harris said. \"When people break down stereotypes, that's what athletics is all about.\"</p> <p>The second significant feature of Wariner's performance in all the rounds was the way he floated over the track with a beautiful fluency and economy, like a Seb Coe of the quarter-mile. He looks wonderfully light on his feet, but when Harris and Brew put the pressure on over the final stretch, he possessed the power to ease away.</p> <p>Wariner attends Baylor University, Michael Johnson's alma mater. He is coached by the veteran Clyde Hart, who was Johnson's guru, although Wariner's classical style could hardly be more different from Johnson's eccentric gait. Hart was pleased to tell those who asked that throughout his career he had believed an athlete's ethnicity to be an irrelevance on the track.</p> <p>Anyone who imagines that Wariner heralds a return to archaic values should note that his diamond ear studs make David Beckham's look undersized, and his small goatee and wraparound shades identify him as a member of the Eminem generation. But what US sprinting needed was someone to break the pattern. And when he and his team-mates compete in the four-lap relay today and tomorrow, they will, barring accidents, be providing the right kind of spectacle once again.</p>",
  "Michael Howard yesterday announced party reviews of child protection legislation, much of it Tory introduced, to ensure that \"politically correct\" attitudes are not over-protecting youngsters or laying society open to extremism. <p>Asserting the need for balance that will \"protect children but not wrap them in cotton wool\", the Conservative leader told supporters in Stafford that his review will embrace his party's 1989 Children Act and Labour's Human Rights Act, which senior Tories claim has spawned a \"compensation culture\".</p> <p>Under the slogan \"political correctness has gone mad and it is driving people crazy\", Mr Howard argued that modern Britain is \"a much kinder, gentler and more tolerant nation than it was 50 years ago\", but it was being undermined by PC attitudes and rules. </p> <p>It made people feel there was \"something odd\" about normal behaviour, gave officials excuses to meddle, encouraged litigation, undermined respect for national institutions and \"plays into the hands of extremists\", he said.</p> <p>Mr Howard's speech was mocked by Labour yesterday as opportunist, inaccurate and a repeat of discredited themes aired by William Hague.</p> <p>David Miliband, the schools minister, contrasted Mr Howard's \"lurch to the right and appeal to core voters\" with his alleged pledge to cut \u00a320bn from public services. The Conservatives say efficiency savings will help them square the spending circle.</p> <p>Mr Miliband said the \"government-backed booklet warning nursery teachers that playing 'musical chairs' encourages aggressive behaviour\" was not funded by his department nor did the government back a ban on the game.</p> <p>Conservative officials said last night that, according to a Guardian report on May 24 2000, Margaret Hodge, a junior education minister, had seen the booklet and was \"happy with it\", though the same report quoted a departmental official as saying Ms Hodge accepted that musical chairs was a \"reasonable game for children\".</p> <p>Mr Howard's examples of PC attitudes \"gone mad\" in the hands of officials in Whitehall and town halls included:</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Sport England urging schools to add group \"problem-solving\" exercises to sports days to help the less sporting pupils;</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Scottish schools being told that football matches with a score of 5-0 or more must be restarted at 0-0 to prevent the losing team being humiliated;</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>The threat to cancel a pancake race in Devon after the school was told it would require a risk assessment, 25 marshals and insurance.</p> <p>Mr Howard said: \"Our children still need to understand, at home and at school, that life is not always fair and that it will, from time to time, deal them hard blows.\"</p>",
  "<p>Everyone complains about their job sometimes, but only musicians enjoy the privilege of charging people to hear them do so. Nowhere is this expensive grumbling more institutionalised than rap. An MC's debut album is often fuelled by a lifetime of poverty and frustration, so sudden success creates a lyrical quandary. Unless one deftly sidesteps the issue, as the Streets did, by recording the follow-up in the persona of a cash-strapped everyman, there are only two options: embrace success or rail against it. Jay-Z has recorded several albums of which the gist is: \"I'm brilliant. Look at my new watch. It's got diamonds on it.\" Eminem, meanwhile, refined \"be careful what you wish for\" to a fine art. </p> <p>Dylan Mills, aka Dizzee Rascal, is caught at the crossroads. The Bow teenager behind the churning anxiety of Boy in da Corner, last year's Mercury-winning debut, was never likely to kick back and enjoy the free trainers, but nor does he treat selling 250,000 albums and reaping blanket critical acclaim as some calamitous misfortune. So the title of Showtime is deeply ambivalent: both a triumphant throwdown and a sardonic dig at his newfound status. </p> <p>The precedents for Showtime include Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP and Tricky's spotlight-dodging second album, Pre-Millennium Tension. Both were recorded quickly and came with cockily self-referential singles: The Real Slim Shady and Tricky Kid. Dizzee's equivalent is the colossal Stand Up Tall: witty, knowing, and swaggering like Godzilla. Over a pinging computer-arcade synth riff, Dizzee uses the standard pirate radio shout-out to reflect how far he's come. Starting with his \"rude boy south-east crew\", he proceeds to \"big up my Europe, USA crews\". On Graftin', he asserts that London \"ain't all teacups, red telephone boxes and Buckingham Palace\". When he made Boy in da Corner, he wasn't sure anyone would hear it. Now he knows the whole world's listening. </p> <p>Such playful defiance suits Dizzee. He's too self-aware, too English, for chest-beating bombast, so when he chats on Hype Talk about \"invitations to premieres and new flicks\", you sense him taking fame's trimmings with a pinch of salt. Even when he's threatening his opponents (of whom much more later) on Everywhere, he's light-hearted and engaging. \"I'll punch you in your nostril, I'll punch you in your shin\" is as surreal as a playground taunt. </p> <p>But when Dizzee loses his sense of perspective, his footing goes with it. As the only MC from London's grime scene to make it big (even his erstwhile mentor Wiley has underperformed), he inevitably provokes jealousy; last summer he was stabbed in Ayia Napa. On Hype Talk, he toys with all the rumours of rifts: \"Is it true that Wiley skipped the country, left him/ Did he punch Mega [So Solid Crew's Megaman] in the face, try to test him?\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, his defensiveness seems disproportionate. Unlike Eminem, he has not been tarred as public enemy number one. Unlike So Solid Crew, he has not been accused of glamorising gun violence (although he takes pains to clarify his minor criminal record in almost legalistic detail on the spectacularly chippy Respect Me). Too often, he dwells on internecine squabbles of which the average listener knows, and cares, little. Compared with the evocative tower-block angst of Get By or Graftin', this recurring obsession with insular scene politics is a blind alley. </p> <p>Even so, that's a relatively minor flaw in a record that is, in every other respect, astonishing. Despite the Stand Up Tall video's dimwitted employment of union flags and strippers, murmurings of a more US-friendly direction prove unfounded. There are no hook-ups with Kanye West, only the merest hint of a skit, and even the R&amp;B chorus of Get By is charmingly wonky. And though Dizzee's laptop dystopias are no longer shockingly new, they are ceaselessly ingenious. </p> <p>Beyond his trademark agitated yelp and panic-attack rhythms are all manner of surprising and compelling sonic twists, from the crawling bass tremor underpinning Graftin' to the ridiculously perky synth motif that dances through Stand Up Tall's chorus. One segue encapsulates Showtime's range. Girls is a migrainous blurt of mutant dancehall on which someone called Marga Man declares that he has \"so much gash, no time to rest\", which must be nice for him. A moment later comes Imagine, a wrenching lament set to desperately gorgeous ambient cascades. And future hit single Dream, which hijacks Captain Sensible's Happy Talk for a frantically jolly British riposte to Jay-Z's Hard Knock Life, fizzes with chutzpah. </p> <p>That Dizzee is the most dextrous and quotable MC Britain has ever produced is beyond dispute, but any rapper, however gifted, needs something to rap about, and the trials of fame offer diminishing returns. Dizzee might want to consider how Eminem and Tricky handled their third albums. One accepted his new position and learned to master it, at the cost of his abrasive edge; the other descended into self-immolating paranoia until all but the most hardcore fans had fled weeping. A problem for Dizzee's next album, then. For now, at least, there's no stopping him.</p>",
  "<p>It's an enduring paradox of Jim Jarmusch's work as a writer-director that, even though his films may initially come across as a triumph of style over content, in the end it turns out to be a victory of content over style. Maybe it's the ultimate paradox of minimalism: the less your work does and is, the more these things matter. </p> <p>In Jarmusch's case, this means the very notions of hipness and independence that originally defined his stylish film-making in the 1980s - with Permanent Vacation (1980), Stranger Than Paradise (1984), Down by Law (1986), and Mystery Train (1989) - started working against his public profile in the 1990s, especially once being outside the mainstream started being regarded with greater suspicion. </p> <p>Furthermore, around the time of Jarmusch's Night on Earth (1992), released the same year as Reservoir Dogs, hipness and independence as values within American culture had become muddled and coarsened in the process of becoming mainstreamed. By then they were being used as advertising labels, and often deceptively. Thanks to Quentin Tarantino, being hip meant knowing all sorts of arcane facts about TV shows and Hong Kong action movies - a kind of pop culture one-upmanship that became all the more universal by being so democratic - while being independent meant allowing Miramax's Harvey Weinstein to decide what to cut from your own films. </p> <p>The crux of the matter, helped by corporate takeovers, was that niche markets existed only through the good graces of the mainstream, so that the Mecca of \"independent\" film-making became a film festival launched by a movie star and kept vital by Hollywood agents. Just as scoring at Sundance meant getting picked up by a studio, flourishing as an \"independent\" meant being distributed by Disney. </p> <p>In contradistinction to Tarantino, however, Jarmusch still owns the negatives of his features - with the exception of The Year of the Horse (1997), a documentary about Crazy Horse commissioned by Neil Young. Furthermore, after cutting a distribution deal with Miramax for his black-and-white western Dead Man (1995), he didn't allow Weinstein to make any changes - and suffered as a consequence when he saw his most ambitious film spitefully marginalised by its own distributor. </p> <p>But of course the film's mixed reception in the US also had something to do with its radical content. Its unforgiving, violent look at American greed and genocide was startling in its intensity, especially after the relatively laid-back charm of his previous features. A more politically oriented Jarmusch manner was taking shape, and it continued in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (2000) and now, even more unexpectedly, in Coffee and Cigarettes (2003). </p> <p>The first of these - which might be read as a kind of indirect, gentlemanly response to Tarantino - fancifully offers as its title hero a solitary black samurai (Forest Whitaker) in one of the New York boroughs, employed as a hitman by ageing small-time Italian gangsters. The second is a collection of 11 comic sketches in black and white - all set in American coffee-houses and adhering to certain minimalist rules of editing, camera angles, and decor (such as cuts to overhead shots of a circular checkerboard tabletop in each episode) - that Jarmusch started working on in 1986. </p> <p>Being a friend of Jarmusch for more than two decades, I can vouch for the fact that his increasing drift towards content wasn't intentional. It's a conscious tribute to his roots in New York minimalism that he cast two members of that downtown scene in the final episode of Coffee and Cigarettes - Taylor Mead and Bill Rice, Beckett-like lowlifes who played, often together, in underground films by Scott and Beth B, Robert Frank, Eric Mitchell, Amos Poe and Andy Warhol. But his wry observations about the ethics of celebrity in two other episodes - one with Steve Coogan and Alfred Molina playing themselves, the other with Cate Blanchett playing herself and her (fictional) resentful punk cousin Shelly - are clearly more intuitive and less inherited. They derive from Jarmusch's own ambivalence about being a recognisable underground figure, someone who can hardly walk a block in any major capital without being spotted. And they both speak volumes about the perverse processes of celebrity pecking orders across the planet. </p> <p>I don't mean to imply that ethical concerns are absent from Jarmusch's first five features - only that they tend more often to take a back seat to the behavioural comedy. It's worth adding that in Stranger Than Paradise and Down by Law, the two films that established his reputation, this comedy often arose from unassimilated Europeans - Eszter Balint and Roberto Benigni, respectively - wandering with a couple of Americans through shifting black-and-white American landscapes that obstinately remained the same. The various cultural differences and mutual misunderstandings between the Europeans and Americans produced much of the dry humour, and Jarmusch was similarly fascinated with the spectacle of Japanese, Italian and English characters all converging in Memphis in Mystery Train. </p> <p>By the time he got to Dead Man, Jarmusch was discovering the same sort of cultural clashes between different kinds of Americans - specifically between a Cleveland accountant named William Blake (Johnny Depp) and a maverick Native American named Nobody (Gary Farmer). Comparable clashes abound in Ghost Dog, where the black samurai hitman and a black Haitian ice cream vendor (Isaach de Bankol\u00e9) can be best friends even though they can't speak a word of each other's language. It should also be noted that certain fantasy elements in Jarmusch's universe were by this time becoming more pronounced, partly because his use of Hollywood genres - westerns and hitman thrillers - were only emphasising his distance from certain mainstream assumptions. </p> <p>One of the darker implications emerging from all this was that you don't even have to be an immigrant in America to feel estranged from the general populace; tribal and cultural differences are more than enough - even though they can sometimes be transcended by personal bonds. (One of the more touching aspects of Ghost Dog is the way the title hero can share books and reading tastes, including Rashomon and Frankenstein, with a white gangster's moll and a black teenage girl.) More recently, this has been made apparent by the parallel outsized commercial successes in the US of The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 - both speaking directly to huge and mainly separate segments of the American populace that feel disenfranchised, and both made even more appealing by the scorn heaped on them in the mainstream media. </p> <p>I'm reminded of Harold Rosenberg's prescient observation about American life in The Tradition of the New (1959): \"Can it be that everybody is looking for a way to fit in? If so, doesn't that imply that nobody fits? ... Perhaps it is not possible to fit into American Life. American Life is a billboard; individual life in the US includes something nameless that takes place in the weeds behind it.\" In a Jarmusch film, one might say that weeds are always the natural habitat. </p> <p>A friend of mine who's been teaching film production in Chicago since the 1980s assures me that Jarmusch has almost invariably been the favourite film-maker of her Third World students, not Tarantino. I was reminded of this earlier this month when Thai filmmaker Pen-Ek Ratanaruang (Last Life in the Universe, 2003) explained that Stranger Than Paradise came as a major revelation, introducing him \"to another kind of mentality and taste; a taste very natural to me but which I didn't know\". </p> <p>I suspect this helps to account for the unexpected commercial success in the US of Coffee and Cigarettes - not a success on the level of a Kill Bill, a Fahrenheit 9/11, or a Passion of the Christ, but on the more modest level of a genuine independent such as Jarmusch who wants to speak from the margins. Yet the fact that he's about to shoot a new feature in colour with Bill Murray and other prominent stars also suggests he's willing to push the limits of those margins. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The Jim Jarmusch season is at the NFT, London, September 1-30. Box office: 020-928 3232. Coffee and Cigarettes is released on October 22. There is a screening at the Edinburgh film festival tonight. Box office: 0131-623 8030.</p>",
  "<p>\"Think pink! think pink! when you shop for summer clothes</p> <p>Think pink! think pink! If you want that quelque chose</p> <p>Red is dead, blue is through</p> <p>Green's obscene, brown's taboo!</p> <p>Think pink, think pink</p> <p>Think pink, think pink</p> <p>Think pink, think pink!\" </p> <p>(Kay Thompson in Funny Face, 1957)</p> <p>Musicals are pretty silly. The people in them find they can do things, amazing things, like dance on the ceiling or build a barn using acrobatics in the place of more traditional construction methods, or get plucked from a crowd to sing a song they know all the words to or choreograph entire streets of people or rollerskate - things that, before they felt a show tune coming on, they simply couldn't do. The men in musicals wear more make-up than the women - Howard Keel leads the field in Calamity Jane - and the women have more drive than the men. Is there any scene more monstrous in film history than that of Barbra Streisand, as Yentl, sailing under the Statue of Liberty hollering \"What's wrong with wanting more?\" in a film not only starring, directed, produced and co-written by the woman, but one in which, despite the Broadway pedigree of her co-stars, she awarded all the songs to herself? Yes, all of them. That, my friends, is the magic of musicals.</p> <p>The history of the genre is to some extent a history of America's relationship with itself: musicals aspire with an almost ideological fervour to the condition of being American. Stern lessons are taught about self-reliance, about how to \"shine\", as orphan Annie puts it, \"like the top of the Chrysler building\". From the homely moral of the Wizard of Oz (\"if you ever go looking for your heart's desire, you needn't look further than your own backyard\"), to the vicious ambition of 42nd Street to Aunt Eller's pioneering-spirit speech in Oklahoma - \"lots of things happen to a woman, sickness, or being poor, or hungry or being left alone in your old age, and you can stand it. There's one way: you gotta be HEARTY!\" - all peddle the show-must-go-on machismo of American conservatism. But they are subversive, too; they poke fun at their own nostalgic values and this conflict is their great source of power, one always missed by people who hate them. \"Let me tell you something, son,\" says Walter Matthau in Hello, Dolly!, \"I've worked hard and I've become rich, friendless and mean. And in America, that's about as far as you can go.\" </p> <p>If musicals amused people in the 1930s, hypnotised them in the 40s and 50s and more or less died out in the 1970s, they have, despite their recycled storylines and arch dialogue, never really wanted for fond audiences. Seventy years after Top Hat was made, who can fail to be charmed by Fred and Ginger gliding around in evening dress to Irving Berlin's Isn't This a Lovely Day (To Be Caught in the Rain?)? Or fail to sigh for Ava Gardner as she gazes, with beady-eyed madness, across the Mississippi at the end of Show Boat, her happiness evaporating to the strains of Ol' Man River? Martha Graham once said, \"It is not the job of the musical artist to be larger than life, but to be as large as life\", and musicals are in essence about luxury: of dress, of movement, of talent, of emotion. What is sadder than a sad song, or happier than dancing?</p> <p>\"Don't you ever let yourself go?\" said Fred Astaire to Cyd Charisse in the film Silk Stockings (1957).</p> <p>\"Go where?\" she said.</p> <p>\"I don't know. Just go, go, GO! Don't you ever feel so happy that you just want to dance all round the room?\"</p> <p>\"Happiness,\" replied Charisse, speaking for straight men everywhere, \"is the reward of industry and labour. Dancing is a waste of time.\"</p> <p>\"I like wasting time,\" said Fred.</p> <p>After a long, slow decline, the film musical appears to be coming back. There are at least five in production at the moment, among them Rent and The Producers, and one soon to be released, De-Lovely, a biopic of Cole Porter in which Kevin Kline plays the lead and the songs are performed by pop stars. Each age gets the musicals it deserves (we must all share the blame for Starlight Express), and so, despite its great score, De-Lovely is a grim exercise in postmodernity. Instead of telling the story straight, it introduces Jonathan Pryce as the \"director\", who keeps a tedious running commentary on the \"authenticity\" of the action. It combines bad irony with that brand of humourlessness peculiar to middle-range pop stars. Only Kline, who has the weakest voice, understands that you have to act a song in musicals: it isn't sufficient to sing it - or in the case of Robbie Williams (who cameos in the film), to gurn it, as if fighting the effects of an extreme G-force. This was a problem in Moulin Rouge, too, a film in which Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman reminded us that people who can't sing, shouldn't sing, unless like Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady they are willing to make up the shortfall with acting.</p> <p>There is no reason why modern audiences can't be carried by new musicals, but the films have to respect the rules of the game. Eminem's 8 Mile, one of the most successful of the recent musicals, was also one of the most traditional: it recoursed to the logic of the show within the show, the Busby Berkeley model, in which the songs appear without compromising the film's realism. In the 1930s, Berkeley was choreographing while seemingly under the influence of crack; crazy giant wedding cakes, women popping out of things, orchestras cast in plaster-of-Paris and those mad Esther Williams swimming flicks, in which she would dive from a board above the stage through flaming hoops into a shallow tank - the kind of stuff CGI would take care of today. Berkeley paid no heed to the requirements of the plot; in fact, as he said in an interview in the New York Times in 1970, \"I did my numbers and the director did the story. Sometimes I'd even forget who was directing.\"</p> <p>The alternative to the show within a show is the musical in which characters sing at each other in place of dialogue. These are the ones people who don't like musicals complain about; all those freaks in orange make-up bellowing \"If I loved you la la la\", then snapping out of it and behaving as if nothing happened. It is the model for the Rodgers and Hammerstein hits of the 1940s and 50s and the golden reign of MGM when one-third of all Hollywood films were musicals. These seem, in some ways, more dated than the bitchy, art-deco hits of the 1920s and 30s. All the talent in them went into the songs and the dialogue was left to stretch unnaturally between show-stoppers.</p> <p>\"I had to leave France,\" says Rossano Brazzi, in a typical exchange from South Pacific. \"I killed a man. But he was a wicked man. The town bully. Everyone in our village was glad to see him die. It was not to my discredit.\"</p> <p>\"You just told me that you killed a man,\" replies Mitzi Gaynor, who has met him for the first time five minutes before. \"And [you say] that it's all right. I hardly know you ... and yet I know it's all right.\" They embrace over a tureen of soup then she pulls herself together to sing I'm Just a Dope Who is Stuck on Hope.</p> <p>The politics of these films haven't dated well, either. In Carousel, which gave us the classic torch song You'll Never Walk Alone and the less classic song Real Nice Clambake, Shirley Jones says wistfully in her role as battered wife, Julie: \"Can it really be that someone hits you, hits you hard, and you don't feel a thing?\" (No, Shirley: that's why it's called acting.) She mumbles something about how, when her evil husband Billy, played by Gordon MacRae, slaps her, it feels as if she's been kissed. The film redeems itself slightly when Billy gets murdered, but sexual politics is a fraught area in musicals.</p> <p>In Funny Face, Audrey Hepburn abandons her own version of herself to adopt one suggested by a creepy old Fred Astaire - way too ancient in 1957 to be playing opposite Hepburn. And yet at the same time, musicals in the 1940s and 50s were really the only form of mass entertainment in which women were allowed to have ambitions not only equal to, but exceeding those of the men. They were consistently more talented, more ambitious and more successful in the plot and in life than their male co-stars. In the 1954 version of A Star Is Born (from a 1937 original co-written by Dorothy Parker), Judy Garland plays the star while her husband, James Mason, plays the washed-up actor, an arrangement that so unhinges him, he walks clean into the sea. \"I hate him for failing,\" says Garland's character, miserably. In Funny Girl, the biopic of Ziegfeld star Fanny Brice, Streisand tries to comfort husband Omar Sharif for being a bit of a loser. \"Everyone has a run of bad luck now and then,\" she says.</p> <p>\"How would you know, darling?\" he replies bitterly. \"You never lose.\"</p> <p>These women always end up alone at the end of the picture, although they do better than their husbands, who are either dead or, worse, in career Siberia. Even Mary Poppins, God love her, disappears up into the sky, alone despite her excellent powers. This is either an indictment of a culture that fears talented women or an attempt to frighten them into submission; the former, I think, since everything in the furniture of these films encourages one to identify with the women: the men fail as Americans - they give up! - while the women fulfil their destinies. It is important that the heroine in these sorts of musicals isn't beautiful; they have, like Liza Minnelli in Cabaret, to be slightly weird-looking. So Gypsy Rose Lee wins out over her pretty sister June and plain-but-hearty Debbie Reynolds triumphs over the beautiful Jean Hagen in Singin' in the Rain. In High Society, one of Cole Porter's greatest scores, beautiful Grace Kelly looks vapid beside Celeste Holm; the balance of power leans firmly towards talent over beauty. </p> <p>If this is a critique of Hollywood by Hollywood, then it's a patchy but powerful one. There is an irony that stems from the issue of prettiness, which Arthur Miller describes at length in his novella Plain Girl: that air of defensive amusement adopted by women who \"should\" be better-looking. It isn't camp in the Rocky Horror sense of the word, but rather a detachment, an irony so delicate that it doesn't interfere with plausibility. It is what rescues a lot of musicals from oversweetness. You see it in Meet Me in St Louis, a potentially saccharine film about the trials of an ordinary Missouri family at the turn of the century. When filming started, Judy Garland played all her scenes tongue-in-cheek, until Vincente Minnelli, her director and later husband, explained that it would really only work if she played it straight. But there remains an edge to her performance, a raised eyebrow that suggests the very concept of \"ordinariness\" depicted in films like these is itself an act of some kind.</p> <p>Musicals of that era, all of which celebrate heterosexual love, didn't have to strive very hard to inject this air of detachment, given that so many of the men who wrote, directed or choreographed them were gay, and so many of the women who starred in them were narcissists. Garland came to epitomise this style of camp. \"Look sweetie,\" she informed the director on the set of Easter Parade, \"I'm no June Allyson, you know. Don't get cute with me. None of that batting-the-eyelids bit or the fluffing the hair routine for me, buddy!\"</p> <p>The contrast between the sweet screen versions of these women and their increasingly loopy and bitter personal lives adds, rather unkindly, to the fascination of the films. In the interview she gave to Rex Reed in 1968, Ava Gardner, so mild and winsome in her early movies, screamed bitterly: \"Christ, what did I ever do worth talking about? I've been a movie star for 25 years and I've got nothing, NOTHING to show for it. All I've got is three lousy ex-husbands. I can't remember my own family's birthdays. Only reason I know my own is because I was born the same day as Christ. That's Capricorn, which means a lifetime of hell, baby.\"</p> <p>In later films, directors got bolder with their digs at the gap between Hollywood's version of life and its reality. In A Star Is Born, whenever a particularly tragic scene is taking place, a billboard creeps into the background advertising a sappy musical called Happiness Ahead, or the scene cuts to a jolly number with lyrics such as: \"Go and get your long face lost.\" Musicals are supposed to be \"the apotheosis of romance\", as Pauline Kael put it, but they also budget for its failure. \"Love isn't enough,\" says Garland tragically at the end of the film. \"I thought it was.\"</p> <p>In the late-1960s, musicals started to lose their appeal. They looked overblown and self-indulgent; they tested the credulity of their audience too severely. The nail in the coffin was Hello, Dolly!, a gruesome film directed by Gene Kelly, with all of the genre's excesses and none of its charms. In the 1970s, the rock musicals gave a brief boost to the genre and then, except for Fame and Grease, the 1980s were a desert.</p> <p>It is tempting to read the current revival as a response to all the misery in the world; the other two booms followed the Wall Street Crash and the second world war. But it is probably just that enough time has passed for the fashion to renew itself. \"I'm as corny as Kansas in August,\" trills Mitzi Gaynor in South Pacific, with a self-awareness one can only commend her for. \"I'm as trite and as gay as a daisy in May.\" Musicals are pretty silly. But you can't help loving them.</p>",
  "<p>The eight men who run Tesco earned \u00a326m between them last year - more than any other board of directors in the FTSE 100. According to the annual Guardian survey of boardroom pay, the Tesco eight together earn nearly five times more than the \u00a35.8m average for a top 100 boardroom. </p> <p>The Tesco executives earned \u00a34m more than Vodafone's directors, the second best paid board, and \u00a323m more than counterparts at struggling rivals J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison. </p> <p>David Reid was the highest paid Tesco executive, making \u00a38.6m last year, largely as a result of cashing in share options accumulated during his 20 years on the board of the grocery group. He became non-executive chairman this year. </p> <p>Sir Terry Leahy, the chief executive, was paid \u00a34.3m in cash and long-term incentives. None of the Tesco men earned less than \u00a31.8m. </p> <p>Average Tesco wages outside the boardroom were among the lowest in our survey. An analysis by the Guardian found that Sir Terry was valued the same as 335 of his employees. </p> <p>Only Tony Ball, former chief executive of satellite broadcaster BSkyB, and Bart Becht, the Dutch boss of household cleaners group Reckitt Benckiser, are more highly valued. </p> <p>As result of lucrative long-term incentive schemes, to which the Guardian has given a hypothetical value, Mr Ball was paid the same as 447 members of the group's ordinary workforce. </p> <p>Mr Becht earned 393 times Reckitt's average pay levels. </p> <p>At the other end of the scale, Brian Larcombe, the long-standing chief executive of venture capital group 3i, was valued at 13 times average 3i pay. He earned \u00a31.2m, while average pay within the organisation topped \u00a392,000 a year, among the highest in the survey. </p> <p>Among the UK's top 100 companies, the average boss receives 72 times the pay of their employees. </p> <p>In total, 187 executives earned over \u00a31m last year, compared with the record of 190 last year. </p> <p>The survey is published as the debate about executive pay continues to rage. Two months ago shareholders claimed the scalp of one of Britain's foremost businessmen in a row over what they regarded as an undeserved performance bonus. </p> <p>Sir Peter Davis, chairman of the supermarket group J Sainsbury, was ousted after big City investors refused to sanction a \u00a32.3m payment because of the grocer's sliding sales and profits. Sir Peter is still in line for another \u00a31m next year. </p> <p>In the first case of its kind, Sir Peter was removed from the board ahead of the company's annual meeting in an effort to head off an embarrassing protest vote about his pay packet. </p> <p>Sainsbury's is now attempting to withhold the payment due to Sir Peter and both sides have called in lawyers to try to settle the dispute. </p> <p>Investors saw Sir Peter's pay as a clear example of rewards not matching performance and wanted to send a forceful message to boardrooms that such deals should be avoided by other companies. </p> <p>This year, the government ruled out new laws to put a stop to excessive boardroom pay and rewards for failure. The trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, said legislation might no longer be necessary and shareholders had \"the potential to remedy the situation\". </p> <p>Ms Hewitt has promised to monitor executive rises and pay-offs until next February to ensure the situation is improving. </p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry has said: \"If that doesn't work we are not ruling out further action.\" </p> <p>Trade unions welcomed the government's decision on the grounds that \"British boardrooms have an impressive record of evading legal restrictions on executive excess\". </p> <p>The government's stance follows its decision a year ago to give shareholders a vote on company remuneration reports, allowing investors to register their anger at executive bonuses which do not reflect performance. </p> <p>The battle against excessive executive pay is not restricted to the UK. In the US, where absolute pay levels are higher than in Britain, William McDonough, chairman of the public company accounting oversight board, said the American public was so angry about bosses' pay that it could lead to legislation. Good bosses did not need big pay, he said. </p> <p>\"There are lots of fine people in America ... who would be happy to be CEOs at more rational levels of income.\" </p> <p>In recent months one of Britain's most successful businessmen, Gerry Robinson, urged companies to scrap bonus schemes because they are divisive and unnecessary. </p> <p>Mr Robinson, who ran Compass and Granada, and now fronts a TV troubleshooting series, said: \"Senior management bonus systems destabilise a business, cause arguments and prompt resignations. If you have one, get rid of it. </p> <p>\"I believe senior management should be well paid and be expected to deliver performance. If they don't ... they should go.\" </p> <p>His comments amazed some investors at drinks group Allied Domecq, where he is chairman. Shareholders staged a revolt this year over a \u00a32.5m executive bonus bonanza. </p> <p>Two of the top three executives in the Guardian's millionaire league are no longer in their jobs. Mr Ball has quit the chief executive post at BSkyB while Michael Green was ousted as chairman of Carlton with \u00a39.4m as a result of the group's poor performance.</p>",
  "One of England's most venerable public schools has dismissed its chaplain and his deputy, apparently after they blew the whistle on an alleged fee-fixing deal among the country's leading independent schools. <p>Winchester College, which charges its 700 boarding pupils nearly \u00a37,500 a term each, has dismissed the Rev Robert Ferguson and his deputy, the Rev Nicholas von Malaise, just two weeks before the start of term. Mr Ferguson had been at the school for 17 years and Mr von Malaise since 1992. </p> <p>In a letter to parents this week, the college's acting head, Tommy Cookson, wrote cryptically that the two chaplains \"had not adhered to the standards expected of senior members of staff in relation to ... certain management issues.\" </p> <p>Winchester was one of four independent schools accused last year of colluding to fix fees. An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading into what, under 1998 legislation, may now be illegal practices, has since been widened to encompass 60 schools. If found guilty the schools could face fines of up to 10% of their turnovers over three years. </p> <p>It is thought that details of internal letters and private memoranda on fees were uncovered by pupils and leaked by them or their parents. Mr Cookson's letter stated that the matter related to boys hacking into the school's computer system: \"This led to publication in two newspapers of confidential information obtained from the college's files.\" </p> <p>The two chaplains appear to have fallen foul of the authorities by speaking about the matter. They were recommended for dismissal by an internal investigation whose findings were confirmed after an appeal conducted by Alan Ryan, head of the school's sister foundation, New College, Oxford, and by a senior London lawyer. </p> <p>One member of staff at Winchester told the Daily Mail: \"They have been wonderful servants to the school and have been treated incredibly harshly for saying too much.\" </p> <p>An anonymous parent was quoted by the Times as saying: \"Mr Ferguson has been there a long time and is a charming fellow ... Both of the chaplains are really nice.\" </p> <p>Dick Davison, spokesman for the Independent Schools Council, said: \"The Office of Fair Trading has been singularly uncommunicative. They are investigating a practice which was not illegal previously, under legislation which we thought did not apply to schools.\" </p> <p>Winchester College did not respond to a Guardian request for clarification.</p>"
