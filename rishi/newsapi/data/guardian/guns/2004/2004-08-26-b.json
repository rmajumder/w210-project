  "<p>Uefa is to investigate Roman Abramovich's links with CSKA Moscow after Chelsea were drawn in the same Champions League group as the Russian club yesterday. The oil company of which Abramovich is the majority shareholder, Sibneft, signed a $54m (\u00a330m) three-year sponsorship deal with CSKA in March and Uefa wants to establish whether the Chelsea owner has deeper ties with the club. </p> <p>Amid suggestions of a possible conflict of interest, European football's governing body wants to clarify if Abramovich has a controlling (51%) interest in CSKA as its rules, in line with European law, forbid anyone from owning two teams in the same competition. </p> <p>Abramovich is a close friend of the CSKA president Yevgeny Giner and watched the club reach the first group stage of Champions League at Rangers on Wednesday, reportedly celebrating in the team's dressing room afterwards. </p> <p>But Chelsea said last night that neither Sibneft nor Abramovich have a stake \"or any direct interest\" in CSKA, adding that Uefa and other Champions League clubs should be \"completely unconcerned\" by the shirt sponsorship link. </p> <p>\"We are going to look into it and see if there is a controlling interest by Mr Abramovich with two teams in the same group,\" said Uefa's communications director, William Gaillard. \"We have to find out whether it is a controlling interest or not. We may already have the facts to decide to dismiss it as a problem but it has to be looked into thoroughly.\" </p> <p>Chelsea's draw with CSKA added to the intrigue in a group in which they also face Porto, their manager Jose Mourinho's previous club, and Paris St-Germain. </p> <p>A Sibneft spokesman insisted there was \"no conflict of interest\" involving Abramovich. \"We have no equity ownership of CSKA so we have no ability or desire to influence them as a company or a team,\" said John A Mann II, its head of media relations. </p> <p>\"I cannot support any conspiracy theories because we don't tell CSKA how to play and Sibneft has no direct relationship with Chelsea.\"</p>",
  "The Foreign Office has for the first time admitted that a British prisoner held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay has alleged suffering ill treatment from the Americans, the Guardian has learned. <p>Until now the Foreign Office had said no detainee had made such allegations while in captivity to it, a claim challenged by several British detainees who said after being released that British officials had ignored their complaints. </p> <p>Martin Mubanga, 31, a former motorcycle courier, made the allegations of ill treatment during a visit to the US base by a Foreign Office official last month, according to an account of the visit written by the government. </p> <p>Letters written by Mr Mubanga to his family have contained coded references in patois and cockney to ill treatment, his relatives say. </p> <p>Mr Mubanga, from north-west London, was detained in Zambia, where he went after studying Islam in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Five Britons released from Guant\u00e1namo in March have all alleged varying degrees of ill treatment, including beatings, forced injections, short shackling, sleep deprivation, and being forced to pose naked. </p> <p>The Foreign Office report on its July 16 visit to Mr Mubanga records key points of a 60 minute discussion with the prisoner, who has been held for over two years without charge, or access to a lawyer. </p> <p>It says: \"Martin mentioned two specific incidents where he said he had been mistreated. We have raised these with the US authorities and have asked them to investigate.\" </p> <p>Last night the Foreign Office declined to give more detail on Mr Mubanga's allegations. It has already asked the US to in vestigate allegations of abuse made by detainees released from Guant\u00e1namo. </p> <p>The Foreign Office report also records that Mr Mubanga said he had lost 20kg in weight, with the Briton adding: \"It wasn't all fat\". </p> <p>The report gives insight into life for prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo. Mr Mubanga, described by the official as having a beard and dreadlocks tied in a bun, was angry about still being imprisoned. He still only gets 90 minutes of exercise a week, playing football in a recreation yard. </p> <p>The report notes: \"Martin said that his new interrogator had started getting him books ... but they were of the interrogator's choice. </p> <p>He said the first had been Huckleberry Finn and it was about a 'nigger'. He said the interrogator was trying to be funny.\" </p> <p>Mr Mubanga said mail from home was taking too long to reach him and he had stopped writing because it was taking so long. </p> <p>The British official told Mr Mubanga that he had rights in the US courts, following a supreme court ruling that said Guant\u00e1namo Bay was covered by US law. </p> <p>Mr Mubanga attacked review tribunals devised by the Pentagon, where he would get no legal representation, as \"a means to keep him in Guant\u00e1namo\". </p> <p>The Foreign Office reports that the meeting ended with its officials and the Briton talking \"in detail\" about Arsenal and the Euro 2004 football championship, which had just finished when the visit took place. </p> <p>Mr Mubanga is due next week to get his first visit from a lawyer since his detention by the US. </p> <p>A total of four Britons and four British residents are still held in Guant\u00e1namo.</p>",
  "<p>Rentokil Initial, supplier of services ranging from security guards and pest control to conferences and exotic plants, has ruled out breaking itself up, despite tumbling profits and a swirl of takeover speculation. </p> <p>After a 14-week review, executive chairman Brian McGowan said the message from stakeholders inside and outside the company was that Rentokil's problems were operational rather than structural. </p> <p>\"Rentokil does not suffer from the problem of a good core business held back by underperforming peripheral businesses. The key to future growth is not divestment potential - it is getting the businesses working more effectively and efficiently.\" </p> <p>In his canvass of City opinion \"there was not one investor ... who suggested a total break-up\". </p> <p>The strategy he was putting in place was to change the company's culture, which had become too centralised and \"stiflingly bureaucratic\". </p> <p>Mr McGowan acknowledged that his new approach would need to deliver within the next year.\"If we don't see an improvement by the back half of 2005 you have to question whether we have got the principle right.\" </p> <p>The McGowan review followed a period of turbulence at Rentokil which included a profits warning and the departure in May of long-standing chairman Sir Clive Thompson - known as Mr 20% for his earnings record - and the exit of chief executive James Wilde in July. </p> <p>Rentokil's tribulations sparked speculation that it might break itself up or become a bid target for private equity companies, with 3i among the names mentioned. </p> <p>With yesterday's announcement ruling out a break-up, at least for the time being, Mr McGowan responded to questions about a possible bid by saying: \"I'll shoot that rabbit when I see it.\" </p> <p>Some analysts believe Rentokil's decision not to kick off a disposal programme still leaves it vulnerable to predators. \"If the group itself is not pursuing such a [divestment] strategy, to our mind that makes it more likely that external parties may attempt to force the issue,\" the broker Seymour Pierce said in a research note. </p> <p>Interim figures from Rentokil yesterday showed turnover virtually flat at \u00a31.2bn with pre-tax profits down 10% at \u00a3180m. The group is forecasting full-year profits of at least \u00a3350m, compared with almost \u00a3400m in 2003. </p> <p>Mr McGowan said Rentokil needed to become more nimble in its approach and authority was being devolved closer to the operating level so Rentokil could respond more quickly to market changes and challenges. He also promised a series of \"infill\" purchases, with the group appointing a new head of acquisitions. The focus would be on hygiene and security operations in the UK, mainland Europe and North America. </p> <p>\"This is not a soft option. This is shaking the whole business to its roots.\" </p> <p>Rentokil had started the process of finding a new chief executive, with Mr McGowan saying the group was looking for a \"well-rounded manager with international experience\". The new chief executive would have an important voice in the group's strategy, which would be kept under review.</p>",
  "There was no \"imminent threat\" to the United States from Iraq. Then there was no strategy for building a new Iraq.\"Hubris and ideology\" ruled. Now, \"Iraq is more dangerous to the US potentially than it was at the moment we went to war\". <p>These are the reluctant judgments of one of the key US officials who participated in the highest levels of decision-making of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). Both interviewed by me and in a forthcoming article in Foreign Affairs journal, Larry Diamond offers from the heart of the Green Zone an unvarnished first-hand account of the unfolding strategic catastrophe. </p> <p>Diamond, a scholar at the Hoover Institution, a conservative thinktank located on the Stanford University campus, was personally recruited to serve as a senior adviser to the CPA by national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, once provost of Stanford. </p> <p>When he arrived in Baghdad, Diamond observed \"a highly centralised decision-making process. There were weighty Americans with decades of experience in the region who were not consulted or integrated into decision-making, foreign service officers up to the level of ambassadors.\" The neoconservatives in the Pentagon were in charge, and CPA head Paul Bremer \"was the agent more of the Pentagon than the state department\". The Pentagon cut out state because the neocons viewed it as \"not on board\" ideologically. </p> <p>The British were regarded as warily as was the state department. British ambassador to the United Nations Jeremy Greenstock was systematically shut out. \"In terms of the final decision-making on key issues I never saw much evidence that [the British] had the opportunity to weigh in.\" When British officials in Basra urged conducting local elections there \"they were vetoed\", Diamond told me. \"It would have helped. If the British had been listened to it might have been better. They had a history with this country.\" </p> <p>The UN was considered only useful as a rubber stamp to approve the flawed decisions. After the August 19 bombing that killed 22 UN personnel, \"the organisation felt that they suffered this trauma and for what? They were so ignored, they felt used. The combination of the risk and the trauma with the lack of impact and consultation left the organisation feeling wounded.\" But when UN representative Lakhdar Brahimi appeared this February, he negotiated the standoff between Shia leader Ayatollah Sistani and the US. </p> <p>\"The reasons there are six women in the cabinet, corrupt members were jettisoned, why the ministers are regarded as able and serious, has a lot to do with the UN team,\" said Diamond. \"It's indicative of what we could have accomplished. </p> <p>\"There are so many bungled elements. We haven't had a strategy for the beginning for dealing with Moqtada al-Sadr. We were flying blind from the start. The result was we didn't neutralise him early on.\" </p> <p>In Falluja, after the murder of four American contractors, the US military pounded the city and withdrew. \"We now have a terrorist base in Falluja. The Bush administration looked at the political cost, at what would have been necessary to destroy this terrorist haven. A country not an imminent threat to the security of the US is now in some areas a haven of the most murderous, dedicated enemies of the US, including al-Qaida.\" </p> <p>In Iraq, the US cannot escape from its own trap without even more ruinous consequences. \"If we walk away the place falls apart disastrously. Americans are not only a bulwark against civil war. They are a stimulus for nationalist and Islamic fundamentalist mobilisation. We need to reduce that stimulus and provocation without robbing the new Iraqi state of the bulwark it needs. </p> <p>\"We have been dealt a bad hand by mistaken decisions, going to war, in prewar planning and in the first few months after the war ended. A lot of negative things are difficult to alter because of mistakes that were not inevitable. There are really no good options.\" </p> <p>Fallujah remains under terrorist control; insurgents run rampant even beyond the Sunni triangle; the number of US soldiers killed spirals towards 1,000; the Iraqi army, disastrously disbanded by the CPA, is being reassembled and trained. The American campaign is consumed with false charges made by a Republican front group about the medals that John Kerry earned in a war more than 30 years ago. The arrogant and incompetent blunders of the Bush administration in Iraq are not debated. On the eve of the Republican convention, Bush burnishes his image as a prudent and reassuring leader. The lethal realities of his \"hubris and ideology\" are for the moment off the screen. Mission accomplished. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "In the colonnaded doorways of Rassul Street, several fighters of the Mahdi army had made their final stand. Their bodies lay in small groups - two here, two there, and five here. <p>For three weeks militia loyal to the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr have defied the extraordinary firepower of the US military, hiding in the network of alleys surrounding Najaf's Imam Ali shrine. Yesterday, however, their uprising appeared to be well into the last act. </p> <p>\"American tanks are extremely close to the shrine. There are several bodies in the narrow alleyways around it,\" Faridh Karim said yesterday, after escaping from the battle zone on his bicycle. </p> <p>\"The dead fighters are scattered everywhere. Some are wearing black headscarves, others just dish dash.\" </p> <p>He added: \"They tried to attack the helicopters using Kalshnikovs and rocket propelled grenades. The helicopters just mowed them down.\" </p> <p>From early morning two US Apache helicopter gunships circled above Najaf's old city. The few Mahdi army fighters left alive tried to shoot them down - sending mortars crashing out across an angry white sky. </p> <p>The gunships responded mercilessly, with rasping machine gunfire. </p> <p>From the shrine itself came the sound of the Koran, broadcast on loudspeakers, and a final, glorious message of defiance - Allah O Akbar, God is great. Its front door remained closed for most of the day. It opened only briefly to allow in steaming plates of rice - lunch for the dozens of human shields still inside. </p> <p>Did Mr Karim have any sympathy for the dead? \"My heart bleeds when I see Iraqis killed by Americans,\" he replied. </p> <p>The uprising by Moqtada al-Sadr - who has not been seen for days - has plunged Iraq's US-backed interim government into its worst crisis so far. For days, ministers have been predicting the revolt by the Mahdi army is in its \"final hours\", only to be proved wrong. </p> <p>The return later today to Najaf of Iraq\"s most revered Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, may hasten the end of the crisis. But Ayatollah Sistani has so far refused to mediate between Mr Sadr and the interim government or to accept Mr Sadr's offer of the shrine's keys. </p> <p>The street in which both clerics live, meanwhile - Rassul Street, immediately opposite the shrine - is currently in the middle of a war-zone, with dead Mahdi army fighters lying among shot-up drapery shops and stores selling Koranic literature, according to witnesses. </p> <p>Yesterday, police officials in Najaf insisted that despite Ayatollah Sistani's imminent arrival, Iraqi troops would soon seize the shrine - something only made possible because of the US military's relentless offensive against the Mahdi army. They also announced they had arrested one of Mr Sadr's lieutenants, Shiekh Ali Semesin, accusing him of theft. </p> <p>Overnight, US tanks inched down Sadiq Street, a narrow road of hotels and cafes that lead directly to the golden-domed complex. Nearby, a platoon of lightly armed Iraqi government soldiers waited for the order to go in. The grid of dusty al leyways to the south of the shrine was also encircled . </p> <p>Black smoke billowed over the old city; the explosions scattered white doves from the rooftops. \"The Americans are crusaders. The democracy they have brought us is the democracy of the bullet,\" Fadhil Hussein, who lives in Najaf's devastated old city, pointed out. </p> <p>Mr Hussein said that an American sniper had shot dead one of his neighbours three days ago, while he was sitting on his roof. \"His body is still in the white building over there,\" he said. \"It is smelling very badly. The whole alley smells. Nobody dares to fetch it. They are afraid the Americans will shoot them as well.\" </p> <p>Mr Hussein said he had gone to check on his house only to discover it had been looted. </p> <p>Mahdi army fighters had taken over several abandoned houses nearby; five out of six homes in the next street had been destroyed, he said. </p> <p>Conditions inside the old city were now unbearable, another resident, Fleiyeh Haasan, added. \"We didn't sleep last night due to the fighting. I have four kids. They spent the whole night crying,\" he said. </p> <p>But opinions over the Mahdi army's last stand are divided - with many in Najaf dismissing Moqtada al-Sadr's supporters as both outsiders - including volunteers from Falluja - and thugs. </p> <p>\"We suffered for 35 years under Saddam Hussein. He killed our clerics. He killed our poets. He killed our writers,\" Kadhim Abdul Karim said, as US tanks and Humvees rattled past his street. \"All our intellectuals left Iraq and our doctors left the country as well. Whatever happens next we want the Americans to stay.\" </p> <p>He added: \"We are typical Iraqis. Moqtada and his supporters are the Taliban of Najaf. You in the west have to understand this. We don't want them.\" </p> <p>Mr Karim said his brother, Zuheir, had been killed three days ago by a stray bullet while sleeping in the entrance of his house; yesterday family members gathered outside, sitting on white plastic chairs, ahead of a funeral feast of roast chicken. \"I'm a businessman and I support our interim government and Ayad Allawi,\" he added. </p> <p>As dusk fell, Najaf's old city continued to burn. \"The police are Iraqis and the Mahdi army are Iraqis. Iraqis should not be fighting Iraqis,\" Abu Haider, who had also fled the old city, said, shaking his head.</p>",
  "<b> Religious studies</b> <br> <b> Totting up the Jewish medals</b> <br> Since the \"modern\" Olympics started in 1896, there have been 400 Jewish medal winners, including Ariel Zeevi who took bronze in the judo last Friday. There are, on average, nine other competitors for every winner, so you could estimate that 4,000 Jews have taken part over the years. Yet somehow the association of Jews and sport, not to say the Olympics, seems a little incongruous. <p>Paul Yogi Mayer - \"Yogi\" to the tens of thousands of people he has trained over almost the past 70 years - keeps count in his new book Jews and the Olympic Games (Vallentine Mitchell). Now 92, he has made this his life's work since he was selected for training for the German team at the 1936 Berlin games. </p> <p>Mayer was a high jumper, a member of one of the many German Jewish youth organisations who were included in the Nazis' selection process as a sop to the Americans. \"But I wasn't good enough. We just didn't have the training facilities.\" He came to Britain in 1939, joined the army and serving in intelligence. After the war, he became a youth leader. </p> <p>And all the time he was counting. </p> <p>In the 1896 Athens games, there were 11 Jewish medal winners - eight of them gold. In Britain, two names stand out - the Chariots of Fire gold winner Harold Abrahams and Holocaust survivor Ben Helfgott, a member of the weight-lifting team in 1956. </p> <p>Of course, the 1936 Olympiad was the most difficult: two Jews won medals for the Germans, including Helene Mayer, who won a silver for fencing and gave the Hitler salute as she accepted her medal. </p> <p>Jews have excelled at fencing - a sport \"for intellectuals, lawyers and academics,\" according to Mayer. The other \"Jewish\" sport has always been swimming. In the 1972 games, which was the highest and the lowest point of Jewish participation, the American swimmer Mark Spitz won seven gold medals, half the \"Jewish\" golds and 11 members of the Israeli squad were murdered (commemorated in a service on the day of Zeevi's triumph). At Sydney in 2000, there were 17 medal winners, two of them gold. </p> <p>Israel has given tremendous scope for Jewish athletes, including those from the former Soviet Union. One difficulty has been a religious reluctance to accept sport. In 1972, the late Chief Rabbi, Lord Jakobovits, said that he had no great pride in Jewish Olympians: \"The games were established by the Greeks, whose attitude to life was totally different from our own.\"<br> <b>Michael Freedland </b> </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Learning curve</b><br> <b> In a class of their own </b><br> Why are Britain's children doing so well in their exams? Everyone has a pet theory: from pupils choosing easy subjects, to exam questions getting simpler, to young people cribbing essays from the internet, to the government's angry response that \"schools are getting better at teaching more and more children\". </p> <p>Firmly excluded from this debate is the apparently ludicrous idea that kids are simply getting cleverer. Yet this is the one explanation that has serious scientific evidence behind it, thanks to the work of James R Flynn, a professor of political science in New Zealand. \"In the 1980s, I analysed old IQ data in America,\" says Flynn, \"and what I discovered was remarkable. 'Intelligence' has been rising by about three IQ points per decade ever since the 1900s.\" </p> <p>This may not seem impressive; it means that a brainiac found in the top 10% of IQ scores a century ago would be medically defined as a moron today. </p> <p>So striking were the results that Flynn and others scrutinised historical IQ scores across the globe. They found that IQ increases were happening everywhere. Since Flynn published, battalions of boffins have picked over the theory. Some think the so-called Flynn Effect undermines the whole idea of IQ tests. Other scientists believe intelligence levels are rising and look to improved nutrition or the challenges of new technology, for an explanation. </p> <p>So, could the Flynn Effect account for the recent exam successes of British kids? Flynn is hedging his bets: \"In large areas of intelligence, like arithmetical reasoning, or general vocabulary, there has been no serious improvement. In certain narrower fields, like verbal comprehension and abstract problem solving, we've seen significant increases. In as much as UK exams assess these latter aspects of a pupil's intelligence, yes, the rise in IQ might be an explanation.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this debate is the outraged way people react to the very idea of rising intelligence. As Flynn puts it: \"Nobody has a problem with better housing or improved nutrition making female breasts larger, or our kids taller, but when we are asked to believe that in certain ways our minds are getting quicker, we angrily refute the notion.\" This is something to think about, next time you ask your 10-year-old child to set the video recorder.<br> <b>Sean Thomas </b> </p> <p><b> Law and order</b><br> <b> Oxford's cadet force </b><br> Anybody wandering through the crime-ridden Oxford estate of Rose Hill on Tuesday afternoon might have been reminded of the old cliche about policemen getting younger. On Rose Hill, they start at eight years old, even if they sound as world-weary as a chief constable approaching retirement. \"There's gangs, there's robbery, there's rubbish,\" sighs 11-year-old Adam. Although in fairness, he adds, there's also a cool uniform: a blue cap and bib that have even inspired him to consider a career in law enforcement. </p> <p>On closer inspection, the uniform doesn't actually carry police insignia. Adam and his 45 fellow crimefighters are members of Oxford city council's new junior street-warden scheme, and they won't be required to hold joyriders in headlocks or pursue violent burglars. Supervised after-school litterpicking sessions are rather more typical - though they have been on patrol looking for out-of-date road tax discs on cars, and will be asked to help identify vandalism hotspots on their estates. </p> <p>If all goes as planned, the scheme, based on a similar one in Swindon, will fight crime and antisocial behaviour on two fronts at the same time. It will make children part of the solution, while also providing a small vindication of the \"broken windows\" theory of policing: the idea that addressing the little things helps reduce more serious crime by reminding potential offenders that someone is watching. </p> <p>Grown-up street wardens \"walk the estates from 8am to 9.30pm\", says Teresa Sheppard, who runs the initiative. \"We're a friendly face. People who don't feel they can talk to the police talk to us.\" </p> <p>Since the street wardens were introduced, according to the most recent statistics, burglary is down 31% on Rose Hill, and 21% on Blackbird Leys, another troubled estate. Robbery is down 5%. </p> <p>This is not to say that recruiting children to the cause is hazard-free. Other children \"call us grasses,\" says Rebecca, also 11 - but this hasn't put her off. \"I joined 'cause I wanted to clean the community up,\" she says. \"There's drink bottles and drugs outside where I live.\" In Adam's case, meanwhile, the scheme may have won a lifelong recruit to the emergency services. \"Ambulance, police, arresting,\" he muses. \"I'd like to do something like that.\"<br> <b>Oliver Burkeman</b> </p> <p><b> Reading matters</b><br> <b> New chapter for the novel</b><br> By the time you read this, I will be in delicate negotiations (code for verbal punch-up) with my fellow Man Booker Prize judges to decide this year's long list - culled from 127 submissions.

  "The answerphone message in the Paris apartment is brief and, for those who know the man who left it, final. \"Cesare is not available,\" it says. \"But he will be checking his messages.\" What the French and Italian authorities would now like to know is: from where? For Cesare Battisti - terrorist-turned-author, villain-turned-victim, a longstanding political, judicial and diplomatic headache finally facing near-certain extradition - has disappeared. <p>His friends say, frankly, that he has left the country, shedding a police tail, and that it was the best thing he could have done. \"I can understand a guy who runs when he was living freely in France, and knows he faces the rest of life in jail in Italy,\" says the novelist Dan Franck. \"If ever there was a case of legitimate flight ... \" </p> <p>For Oreste Scalzone, one of the first of more than 300 reformed far-left guerrillas from Italy who have, like Battisti, sought refuge in France since 1985, \"his decision to unhitch his destiny from this extraordinary, senseless witch-hunt is nothing more than good human sense\". </p> <p>The popular French crime writer Fred Vargas, who published a passionate defence of her fellow author last month, The Truth about Cesare Battisti, says his apparent flight abroad is \"a legitimate act of self-defence. I was witness to the dramatic decline in his psychological state ... He proclaimed his innocence, and was portrayed as a monster.\" </p> <p>But not everyone is in agreement; Battisti's case (and his cause) have split France. To his backers - intellectuals, writers, politicians and showbiz stars of the broad left - he is a remade man who, like others of his kind, was promised sanctuary in France. That pledge has now been reneged on by a rightwing government that has brought shame on the Republic. </p> <p>To his opponents, however, Battisti is a criminal, a one-time member of a terror cell called Armed Proletarians for Communism, one of many violent ultra-left groups (including the infamous Red Brigades) whose bombings, kidnappings and killings rocked Italy in the 1970s and 80s and claimed 400 lives. Found guilty in Italy of three murders and of complicity in a fourth, Battisti must be punished they argue. </p> <p>The pledge of safety given to the men and women engaged in the Years of Lead, so called because of the sheer weight of bullets used in the terrorist attacks, was made by France's first Socialist president, the late Francois Mitterrand, in a 1985 speech to the League of Human Rights. At a time when Italian courts were dispensing unsafe decision after unsafe decision, often based solely on the evidence of informants who had been promised immunity from prosecution, he said the former terrorists would not be extradited from France on condition that they broke with \" la machine infernale \", that they renounced their past, and did not go into hiding, and kept out of politics. </p> <p>Some 100 former Italian extremists who took up Mitterrand's pledge, upheld by two French presidents and nine prime ministers of both the right and left, are thought still to be living in France. Most, like Battisti, who has a wife and two children aged 18 and nine, are now fathers and mothers. All are worried. And rightly or wrongly, all feel betrayed. </p> <p>\"Faced with a wall of cynicism erected by an irresponsible state, by a wall of silence built on the lies of certain former militants who even today are prepared to pawn the truth for their own safe conduct, France took the political responsibility to offer us a way out: lay down our arms, come out of hiding, present ourselves before the authorities of the Republic,\" wrote two of them, Enrico Porsia and Alfredo Ragusi, in Le Monde this week. </p> <p>\"That is what we did. For its part, the Republic guaranteed that no one wanted in Italy for 'politically inspired acts of violence' would be extradited ... Why does this pledge suddenly have no value? Twenty years later, we are criminalised and pursued by our new community. A country that had promised us asylum, given us residence permits and even, in some cases, French nationality. We cannot, we will not, submit to this 'betrayal of state'.\" </p> <p>The Paris appeals court that judged Battisti's case in late June, more than 10 years after another French court refused an earlier and near-identical Italian extradition request, did not sadly attach quite the same weight to Mitterrand's promise. In a country with an independent justice system, the courts \"cannot be bound by political promises made by a French government 20 years ago\", it said. </p> <p>The defence's argument was that Battisti should not be extradited because, although he was convicted in absentia in Italy in 1993, he would not - as he would be in France - be allowed a retrial; the court ruled, however, that the writer had forfeited his right to be retried because he had voluntarily refused to attend the first one. </p> <p>Several leading lawyers have since been heavily criticial of the appeal court's decision. \"Absolutely no new evidence was presented that was likely to change the opinion of French justice on the reality of the crimes of which Battisti is accused,\" says one authority, Jean-Pierre Mignard. \"The ruling overturned a policy of state that had been adhered to for 23 years, for no objective reason. It makes you think there has to be something beyond the confines of the case itself.\" </p> <p>Battisti was born in 1954 in Latina, south of Rome. Jailed in 1976 for a string of minor offences, he converted to the cause of the armed class struggle and joined the Armed Proletarians for Communism. Arrested in 1979 as part of an inquiry into the murder of a Milan jeweller, he was sentenced in May 1981 to 12 years in prison for possession of arms and membership of an armed gang. In October that year, he escaped. </p> <p>Battisti came first, briefly, to France, then headed to Mexico where he worked by turns as a graphic artist, a pizza cook, a barman and a freelance journalist. He arrived in France for good, preceded by his wife and daughter, on September 5 1990, and has since established himself as a crime and thriller writer. He is the author of a dozen successful and critically acclaimed works including Shadow Clothes, Never Again Without a Rifle, and Last Bullets. Most draw extensively on his past life; Paris-Match recently praised them as \"the best-written condemnation there is of the absolute impasse that is terrorism\". </p> <p>But in March 1993, a Milan court convicted Battisti in his absence of murdering a prison guard in Udine in 1978, a policeman in Milan in April 1979, and a neo-fascist militant in Mestre in February 1979. The same court also found him guilty of complicity in the February 1979 murder of a jeweller whose son was left paralysed by the attack. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. </p> <p>In a rare interview earlier this month, the writer vehemently protested his innocence. His 1993 conviction was based on false testimony from turncoats, he said. \"I have never killed, and I can say this looking straight into the eyes of the parents of the victims and the judges,\" he told Le Journal du Dimanche. </p> <p>Since the June court decision against him, according to Vargas, he was in \"a palpable state of distress. I don't know whether he had any confidence in the justice of this country, in Italy, in anything, and he had become very fragile. He cried a lot. He was scared. He had been psychologically destroyed.\" </p> <p>Battisti's supporters openly accuse the French government not only of abandoning Mitterrand's promise but also of conniving with the rightwing government of Silvio Berlusconi in a cynical grab for the law-and-order vote. \"The government put him in a completely impossible position,\" said Julien Dray, the Socialist party spokesman. \"We are rewriting the script, playing with people's lives and those of their families, when the page had been turned. And it is absolutely unberabale to hear Berlusconi giving lessons to anyone about observing the law.\" For its part, the French justice ministry said bluntly this week that it \"saw no reason\" why convicted terrorists should not be punished, adding that \"certain comments by those who defend Mr Battisti and approve his flight are appalling and irresponsible\". </p> <p>If Battisti's case has brought to the surface deep-seated antagonisms between right and left in France, the same is no less true of Italy, where domestic terrorism is still a live issue: only last year the Italian security forces broke up the reborn Red Brigades, whose guerrillas are accused of murdering two senior government advisers and a policeman over the past five years. </p> <p>Many Italians argue that France did not suffer anything comparable to Italy's Years of Lead, in which right and leftwing terrorists battled with each other and the state. The most famous victim of those years was the former Christian Democrat prime minister Aldo Moro, kidnapped and murdered by the Red Brigades in 1978. </p> <p>The pro-Battisti campaign in France has infuriated a large number of his fellow countrymen, many of who feel justice in such cases does serve a purpose. On Monday, two women who played a leading role on opposite sides in the Years of Lead sat across a table from each other at a meeting in Rimini organised by the Roman Catholic group Comunione e Liberazione. </p> <p>Francesca Mambro, aged 45, a former member of the neo-fascist NAR who received six life sentences, smiled and chatted amiably with Nadia Mantovani, aged 53, and ex-Red Brigades guerrilla who served most of a 20-year sentence before her release in 1993. Their reconciliation, with each other and with much of the rest of Italian society, has been made possible in large part because they paid a penalty for their crimes. </p> <p>It remains a running sore, particularly for the right, that some far-left terrorists never have. Roberto Castelli, the justice minister in Berlusconi's government, reacted with outrage to the news that Battisti had escaped, lambasting a European left which, he claimed, \"defends murderers [and] defends fugitives\". </p> <p>Castelli has made it a priority task to get back those still on the run. Top of its list is Alessio Casimirri, the only alleged member of the group that killed Aldo Moro still at large, currently living in Nicaragua. Also earmarked as priority cases are two other former Red Brigadists, Enrico Villimburgo and Roberta Cappelli, both now living in France. They top a list of 12 wanted former guerrillas whom Paris has - until now - been reluctant to hand over for trial in Italy. </p> <p>At the root of that reluctance have been profound misgivings over the impartiality of Italy's judicial system. Far from being eased, these have if anything been strengthened by the case of Adriano Sofri, a former leader of the hard-left Lotta Continua (Continuous Struggle), who has been held in prison since 1997 for a crime many on the right, as well as the left, believe that he never committed. </p> <p>Sofri is serving a 22-year sentence for ordering the murder of a senior Milan police officer. He was convicted largely on the word of a witness who turned state's evidence and had his sentence reduced. Sofri, a noted commentator who contributes each week from prison to the liberal news magazine L'Espresso, endured an absurdly contorted succession of trials shot through with anomalies and contradictions. </p> <p>Battisti's supporters may well be right in arguing that he will never receive fair treatment in Italy: that meted out to Sofri was so outrageous that even Berlusconi has felt compelled to back moves for his release. Between a country that will no longer respect a promise, and another where justice is maybe not always all it could be, the writer has made his choice: in Scalzone's words, \"He is ... I hope, as far away as possible. And, this time, really beyond their reach.\" </p> <p><b>Where are they now?</b><br> <b>Europe's other fugitive political extremists</b> </p> <p><b> Germany:</b> Three figures are still on the run from the avowedly leftist group whose killings and abductions made the 1970s known as Germany's \"decade of terror\" - Red Army Faction. <b> Ernst Volker Wilhelm</b> <b> Staub</b>, <b> Daniela Klette</b> and <b> Burkhard Garweg</b> are wanted in connection with a linked kidnap, killings and hijack in autumn 1977, which led to the murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer, a former Nazi who headed the German employers federation. </p> <p><b> Northern Ireland:</b> As well as more than 400 republicans and loyalist militants released early under the 1998 Good Friday peace accord, there are reported to be 30 to 60 IRA fugitives.

  "<p>Airlines were urged yesterday to carry life-saving equipment to treat heart attack victims, after an investigation into the collapse of a Ryanair pilot on a flight carrying 137 passengers.</p> <p>The first officer of a flight from Brussels to London had to take control of the aircraft, declare an emergency and return to Belgium's Charleroi airport after realising that the captain appeared \"lifeless\". </p> <p>An official report into the incident, which happened two years ago, said the senior flight attendant, who was called to the cockpit, gave the captain oxygen and moved his feet off the rudder pedals but was unable to revive him. Investigators found that because of a paperwork \"anomaly\", Ryanair had failed to train the attendant on how to respond to the incapacity of a pilot. </p> <p>Despite the efforts of a doctor on the flight, who initially declared the pilot dead before resuscitating him, the captain never fully recovered. </p> <p>Safety regulators in Ireland yesterday urged aviation's international governing body, ICAO, to make it mandatory for airlines to carry defibrillators - which are used to revive heart attack victims. They have been a requirement on flights in America since April. BA, BMI and Virgin Atlantic already carry them on intercontinental flights.</p>",
  "<p>Parlour games were once the preserve of Victorian dinner parties. Over the years, families have spent countless Sunday afternoons engaging in a few rounds of charades or an epic bout of Monopoly. But as technology pushes traditional games on to computers and consoles, a new generation of digital parlour games is taking root. </p> <p>One of those leading the charge is SingStar for the Sony PlayStation 2. At first glance it seems a lot like karaoke - players sing in time to a range of popular hits that play without the original vocals. But unlike the original Japanese concept, the game combines singalong interactivity with software that can assess a singer's pitch and timing through a microphone. In a game of SingStar, the PS2 compares your voice to the original vocal track and awards you points for good singing. </p> <p>With both Sony and karaoke originating in Japan, you would be forgiven for thinking SingStar is Japanese. Not so. SingStar was devised and produced in London by a bunch of twenty-somethings in Sony's corporate headquarters in Soho. The team, whose oldest member is 29, spent four-and-a-half years developing the game - the longest ever gestation period for a PlayStation title. </p> <p>For the first two-and-a-half years, one person worked on the project - Sharu Gupta, a 27-year-old computer engineer from Hammersmith. In 1999, fresh out of college, Gupta realised the sound processors in the original PlayStation could be used not just for output, but for sound input, too. </p> <p>\"I was asked to develop software for pitch detection,\" she explains in a replica living room on the seventh floor of Sony's London offices. \"I started taking recordings of piano scales and wrote some software that would analyse each note and tell me what it was.\" It was, she says, a modest breakthrough - but one that eventually led to SingStar. </p> <p>The game features 40 licensed hits from the premier league of pop. SingStar players go on an eclectic excursion through mainstream pop history, taking the place of Madonna, Ricky Martin or even Lemmy from Mot\u00f6rhead. Microphones allow players to sing solo, in a duet or battle head-to-head with friends. \"It is perfect for anyone who has ever sung into their hairbrush,\" offers Gupta. </p> <p>Somewhat surprisingly, given karaoke's global popularity, Sony insists that SingStar has little to do with the clunky, back-of-the-pub karaoke experience redolent of drunken nights. \"Karaoke has been a fast, dirty and cheap product where the graphics are crappy and nobody cares,\" says the game's 27-year-old Canadian producer, Paulina Bozek. </p> <p>SingStar is just the latest example of the \"21st-century parlour game\" - a diverse, but growing, category of games that use peripheral accessories such as microphones instead of traditional joystick control. Konami's Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), a hyperactive dancing game, uses a dance mat and has even been responsible for part of a new fitness fad in the US. One man in Hawaii claimed to have shed more than 30 pounds after months of daily DDR. </p> <p>The Sony EyeToy - developed by the same studio as SingStar - uses motion capture software and a camera to track the physical gestures of players. Nintendo, Sony's arch-rival, is set to join the fray with its take on the genre. Donkey Konga, a frantic drumming game, was previewed at this year's E3 show in Los Angeles and will be in shops for Christmas. </p> <p>What these games also share is their appeal to a wider demographic than traditional video games - particularly women, who are keen on the social nature of games that take place in real space. </p> <p>\"With DDR, people who would not identify themselves as videogamers saw the value of spending $150 on a console,\" says Dr Ian Bogost, a lecturer in games studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology, in the US. \"They began to see the value of the games console as a device for the whole family. It's a new kind of card table for the family.\" </p> <p>Even so, Sony has taken something of a gamble with SingStar. The game retails for the price of a standard PS2 title, yet comes bundled with two microphones. There are also music publishing rights to pay for every game sold. </p> <p>Sales have been steady, but Sony insists the game is more of a slow-burner than one-hit wonder. A range of follow-up compilation discs will ensure the game has a bright future. Just don't call it karaoke.</p>",
  "Paris partied to celebrate the 60th anniversary of liberation from Nazi occupation yesterday, but its mayor warned that, faced with a recent surge in racist and anti-semitic attacks, the city needed to recover the courage it had shown in the summer of 1944. <p>\"If, 60 years ago, our elders were able, at a cost for some of sacrificing their lives, to rid themselves of barbarians, we must be capable today of not giving in to indifference, of defeating those who continue to insist that a person is different because of their race or religion,\" Bertrand Delanoe said on French radio. </p> <p>\"Those who, at immense risk to themselves, stood up and fought the racist ideology of the deportations, of the Shoah, were heroes,\" the Socialist mayor added. \"We need their spirit today, at the start of the 21st century. It's an insult to their name to see swastikas still being daubed on walls in the city of Paris.\" </p> <p>Mr Delanoe was speaking three days after arsonists set fire to a Jewish community centre in central Paris and scrawled anti-semitic graffiti on walls and furniture. </p> <p>Visiting the gutted centre yesterday, the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, said it \"cannot be\" that 60 years after Paris was liberated, \"Jews will live under threat here\". </p> <p>France's interior ministry said 160 attacks against Jews or Jewish property had been recorded in the first six months of 2004, compared with 75 in the same period last year. \"Surely if the lessons of the past are being celebrated so vigorously, it is in an effort to contain the further spread of contemporary woes,\" the left-leaning Liberation said in an editorial. </p> <p>Kicking off yesterday's events, tanks and troops lined up on the Place de la Concorde for a military ceremony at which the president, Jacques Chirac, decorated three veterans of the 2nd Armoured Division, the first allied force to reach the city. </p> <p>There was also an emotional re-enactment of the raising of the tricolore on the top of the Eiffel Tower, and a festive procession by two military columns which retraced the paths through central Paris taken by French and US forces to finally seize control of the city. </p> <p>Mr Chirac presided over further ceremonies, one at the Paris police headquarters, where he unveiled a plaque commemorating the surrender of German forces by their commander, General von Choltitz; and another at the city hall, where schoolchildren read essays written by the pupils of 60 years ago and an actor read the farewell letters of resistance fighters who had been sentenced to death. More than 1,400 Parisians, including 582 civilians, were killed in the battle for their city, and 3,200 Nazis died. </p> <p>Two huge popular balls, in the Luxembourg gardens and on the Place de la Bastille, rounded off the celebrations last night, with city authorities inviting Parisians to dance the night away to swing and bebop bands - dressed, if possible, in their 1940s finest.</p>",
  "<p> Ever since Darwin, we have been a nation of naturalists. About 100,000 Britons collect data on plants and animals in the wild. \"Recorders\", almost all amateurs, have logged some 60m records of bluebells, dragonflies and the other 60,000-odd species thought to be native to the British Isles. </p> <p>Dr James Munford, programme director of the National Biodiversity Trust, is trying to persuade these enthusiasts to share their work. The biodiversity network's principal tool is a website, NBN Gateway. It allows anyone to search for records of any species, by scientific or colloquial name, or to select an area of Britain and find out which species have been recorded there. Could there be grass snakes in your garden? The site will tell you whether one has been recorded within 10km. </p> <p>It won't tell you the exact grid reference, however. Such information can be highly sensitive, says Munford. Most nature recorders have strong feelings about what's done with their data: \"They don't necessarily want to disclose the exact location of a rare or threatened species.\" Wildlife data can also have enormous legal significance, for protecting habitats under international convention and prosecuting offenders. </p> <p>The solution is to give data owners control over how records are viewed. Mostly, this is done by reducing the level of accuracy. Recorders, equipped with global positioning system (GPS) satellite receivers, usually log their sightings to an accuracy of 100m. This is how it goes on to the network, and can be viewed by authorised users. However, if data owners wish, they can degrade the resolution to a 10km square, rendering the information useless to egg-collectors and such-like. </p> <p>So far, the network, which is a partnership between public agencies and voluntary groups, has received about 15m species records. These have mainly been assembled by digitising existing collections going back over decades. As a result, the site can show a timeline of records where a species was once spotted, but is now no longer found. </p> <p>Historical continuity is vital. The gateway can display data according to the 112 British \"vice counties\" of similar sizes, devised in 1852 to represent the distribution of plants, and used by naturalists ever since. Vice county boundaries, originally hand-drawn, have been transferred to modern digitised maps of much greater accuracy, sticking exactly to the original lines. This ensures that successive generations of naturalists know they are talking about the same places. </p> <p>Technically, the NBN Gateway consists of a data repository between individual data collections and the web front end. The repository, hosted at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology at Monkswood in Huntingdon, runs an SQL database. Two key pieces of software are ArcIMS (a geographical information system) and ArcSDE (a special database engine), both from ESRI, an IT company. The site costs about \u00a3250,000 a year to develop and run, including staff wages. It is funded by the Na tional Biodiversity Network Trust, a charitable company that raises most of its money from subscriptions. </p> <p>Every month, more than 100,000 records go into the repository. Until now, the site has been publicised only among enthusiasts. \"We now have got critical mass and we're ready to expose it to a larger and more critical audience,\" says Munford. However, he admits that more needs to be done to persuade recorders to share their data. For many, he hopes that seeing the data put to good scientific use will be reward enough. Some records have gone on the site within 10 days. The speed is up to the local process of verifying and validating a record. </p> <p>On its own, the network has increased the amount of global biodiversity information available by 50%. The largest data set in the world is of UK vascular plants, with 9.5m records. But although Britain's biology is the most studied in the world, records have been collected of only 15% of its species. </p> <p>In fact, no definitive list of species is yet available, says Charles Hussey, science data coordinator at the Natural History Museum in London. Creating a species dictionary is the goal of another biodiversity network website, hosted by the museum. \"There are around 60,000 species in Britain and around 300,000 names,\" says Hussey. These include mis-spellings, names that have changed and species that have been aggregated. </p> <p>The bluebell, for example, has had three Latin names over the years: on top of that, the plant known in Scotland as the bluebell comes from a completely different family and is known elsewhere in Britain as a harebell. The dictionary will resolve these confusions. \"To complete it is do-able,\" says Hussey, \"but it's never going to be finished. To know what's found in the British Isles you have to go and look.\" </p> <p>For less obsessive wildlife lovers, another free Natural History Museum website, Nature Navigator, presents information aimed at children and gardeners. It lists the common and scientific names of 8,000 species, with paintings and drawings from the museum's collection. Enough to keep most suburban Darwins busy. </p> <p><strong> NBN Gateway</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.searchnbn.net\">www.searchnbn.net</a> </p> <p><strong>Species dictionary</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nbn\">www.nhm.ac.uk/nbn</a> </p> <p><strong>Nature Navigator</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/naturenavigator/  \">www.nhm.ac.uk/naturenavigator</a></p>",

  "<p>If you're not already a committed user of a credit-card sized smartphone, the chances are you soon will be. Sales of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are falling, say analysts, while advanced mobile phones are soaring off the chart. But will the worlds of portable computing and mobile communications converge to a point where one type of handset will ultimately wipe out the other? </p> <p>If you're a company director, you could be forgiven for feeling confused about where this whole mobile technology thing is heading. You want your staff to be more productive and less tied to the office, but which route should you take? Snazzy camera phones with fast net connections? The dedicated Blackberry devices that have seduced the corporate worker? Or a more powerful device, providing almost everything you could have on a laptop, but with far less bulk to carry around? </p> <p>The decision doesn't end with the hardware either. There's the type of applications you'll want staff to have access to, which means you need to consider the operating system. And do you need a company-wide GPRS or 3G contract, or are WiFi and Bluetooth more appropriate in a business context? </p> <p>Compounding the problem, you'll also need to consider any other devices your staff may be carrying already for personal use. If they're already having a longstanding love affair with a particular camera phone or deluxe paper-based organiser, you may have a hard time persuading them to embrace something else.</p> <p>According to recent findings from Datamonitor, smaller businesses, while not traditionally big users of mobile devices, are likely to start embracing the technology as costs come down.</p> <p>Blackberry devices have done much to put mobile gadgets on the map for the business community, and this looks set to continue. Initially, these dedicated devices, now five years old and used by 1.3 million subscribers around the world, were designed simply to \"push\" emails out to busy executives on the move.</p> <p>Blackberry's reach is now growing too, as its inventor, Research in Motion (RIM), has licensed the technology so it can be used on other devices, including phones from Nokia, Siemens and Samsung. It is also broadening the range of applications that can be supported, which can only enhance its appeal to the business community. RIM's European vice-president for commercial operations, Rick Costanzo, says: \"The server software now talks to any application that's HTTP or XML addressable, which applies to 99% of corporate applications, including customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning applications.\"</p> <p>This, along with RIM's decision to open up its technology to other handset manufacturers, will be critical to the company's long-term success, since Gartner statistics suggest that, by 2007, 67m of the 103m data-centric devices shipping globally by then will be smartphones, compared with a more modest 36m PDA or hybrid PDA/phones.</p> <p>\"That doesn't mean the PDA market is dying, but that it is growing at a slower rate,\" says Simeon Payne, UK product marketing manager for Windows Mobile at Microsoft, an interesting company to watch because of its heritage in traditional computing. If Microsoft, champion of the PC, PDA and tablet PC, sees the smartphone stealing the market, there must be something in it.</p> <p>The Microsoft marketing message is that if you choose a device based on Windows, you'll be protected from having pockets of information and contacts on different machines which can't be synchronised.</p> <p>But will companies buy into the mobile phone as a device for business data? Payne concedes that this will depend to some extent on how quickly software developers bring \"must have\" applications to the market. </p> <p>\"There are already some very simple applications that whet the appetite,\" he notes, pointing to an RAC information system which feeds critical traffic information to mobile phones for a one-off annual subscription of \u00a340. This could save companies a fortune in wasted business time spent in traffic jams.</p> <p>For businesses like IT outsourcing consultancy ihotdesk - which has no offices, working from home, on the move or from a client's site - advances in mobile technology and applications are critical. Its staff are dependent on wireless connectivity and smartphones to pick up emails and communicate with colleagues and clients.</p> <p>So what does the future hold - will we be downloading our business data on to a wristwatch in a few years' time?</p> <p>\"Many people now have several mobile phones, just as they have several pairs of shoes. At the weekend, they might choose a mini-mobile, and for work a maxi-mobile, and simply switch the Sim card between them,\" says James Stewart, a senior researcher at the University of Edinburgh studying the social aspects of IT. This, however, relies on standards being developed which allow these multiple devices to work together as a virtual device. \"This is likely to be very difficult as different industries try to set standards to suit themselves,\" Stewart notes.</p> <p>In the meantime, the exciting space to watch is the role of the car in the mobile experience, he says. \"The car is the main mobile device for many people, and can overcome the limitations of the small handheld. BMW and Renault have some interesting plans in this area that are worth keeping an eye on.\"</p> <p><strong>Gadget guide</strong></p> <p>Some of the \"sexier\" devices available today or coming soon...</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Orange SPV C500 claims to be the world's smallest smartphone today, measuring 108 x 46 x 16mm and weighing just 100g. It runs Windows Mobile and has a colour screen and versatile keypad. Prices vary by contract. Other Orange phones to check out include the PalmOne Treo 600 which runs a Palm OS organiser, supports web and email over GPRS and can be used with an existing Vodafone or Orange Sim card. The Treo costs \u00a3525.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Motorola MPx, billed as the first Wi-Fi-enabled phone, has two guises. Open it one way and it's a phone, open it another and there's a full computer keyboard. Based on Microsoft Pocket PC, and described by some analysts as the nearest thing to a converged device so far. Other Motorola devices of note: the V400P and the V80. Prices not available.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The new Nokia 9500 Communicator, comparable to the Motorola MPx but not due to ship until Q4, supports GPRS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and runs a range of Symbian-based business applications. Built-in camera and multimedia messaging, 80Mb of memory and two colour screens. Weighs just over 200g. Likely to cost more than \u00a3500. Other notable Nokias: the 6800 series.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Sony Ericsson P900, available from \u00a3100 on a pay-monthly contract, offers full PDA functionality but looks and feels like a phone. Provides email and internet via GPRS, and has a car kit solution. Also worth a look: the P800.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Sendo X from Sendo is causing a stir at the moment, supporting up to six email accounts and recording up to 30 minutes of video. Sendo claims the Symbian-based device is the most powerful multimedia smartphone currently available. Cost: \u00a3335.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Samsung D710 business phone, running Symbian, supports full multimedia and video, and has an integral camera, with flash.</p>",
  "<p>Michael O'Leary's threat to make Ryanair passengers pay extra to put bags in the hold prompted disbelief this summer. But not from Charles Keisner.</p> <p>\"O'Leary was right,\" says the head of sales at <a href=\"http://www.firstluggage.com\">FirstLuggage.com</a>, an internet start-up which promises to pick up your luggage and deliver it to the hotel. \"I feel sorry for them. But they're in the passenger business. Airlines shouldn't handle any baggage. It should be left to professionals.\"</p> <p>Travellers examining British Airways' latest lost luggage statistics might well agree - the airline has one of the worst records in Europe, with 5,000 bags disappearing permanently last year. BA is unlikely to follow Ryanair's example - BA is a full-service airline, after all. Nonetheless, the airline must be a little envious of O'Leary's willingness to shrug off the troublesome and time-consuming business of handling passengers' suitcases.</p> <p>Baggage handlers, after all, are notoriously willing to strike. They slow down turnaround times. And the amount of compensation that passengers whose bags have been lost can claim has just tripled to more than \u00a3800 thanks to the Montreal convention, which came into force last month.</p> <p>What's more, if BA ever decided to crack down on cabin baggage allowances, business travellers roughing it in economy would revolt. You don't think you take that much on board? Think again. The new Apple iBook G4 boasts that it's the lightest notebook on the market: the 12.1in model weighs just under 5lb, the 14.1in almost 6lb. That's almost half the 13lb allowance BA permits in its economy cabin.</p> <p>Bmi British Midland is slightly more generous - 15lb within Europe - and Ryanair has just increased its allowance to 10kg, or 22lb. But it has also put up the charge for excess weight to \u00a34.50 per kg. Three days after Ryanair's announcement, easyJet abolished weight limits altogether. As long as you can remove a case from the overhead locker without dropping it on your colleague's head, it can measure up to 55cm x 40cm x 20cm.</p> <p>What Keisner wants is to take away the calculation entirely. Ship a suitcase or sample with FedEx or UPS and they will demand the weight and probably ask you to repackage it. While bigger companies usually have an account with a shipper, SMEs often don't, and you can't just visit the website, type in your details and have the bag collected - both require pre-registration.</p> <p>Keisner is hoping the relatively transparent charges - \u00a380 one-way for a suitcase sent to western Europe, \u00a3179 for a return trip to the newest members of the EU - will encourage business travellers to have their cases picked up from home rather than taking them into work, checking in early at the airport and waiting for them at the baggage carousel. </p> <p>FirstLuggage.com, which uses FedEx itself, has a few drawbacks. They won't collect or deliver at weekends, and each piece of luggage is only insured up to a maximum of \u00a3250 - you pay \u00a315 for each additional \u00a31,000 worth of cover. The company can't yet estimate what time bags will arrive on a particular day, though it will send a text message when they've arrived.</p> <p>Keisner says FirstLuggage.com will begin shipping bags to the US when he's confident they will arrive on time. The US Transportation Security Authority recently warned that locked passenger bags risked being forced open by screeners. I asked him if enhanced security would hinder his business. \"Nothing is loaded on to a FedEx plane that isn't x-rayed, and that is that,\" he insists. He hopes to begin shipping to the US at the end of this year.</p> <p>The cost seems high. Yet if you add up the price of a taxi to work, another cab to the airport, a long wait at each end of the journey, and a tip to the hotel porter, you might find it worthwhile to entrust your samples and suitcase to someone else. At the very least, it removes that anxious moment at check-in as you watch your baggage roll away towards the innards of the terminal building, possibly never to return.</p> <p><strong>Access all areas</strong></p> <p>Hungarian-owned airline Wizzair (<a href=\"http://www.wizzair.com\">wizzair.com</a>) - not to be confused with <a href=\"http://www.wizzair.co.uk\">Wizzair.co.uk</a>, a site belonging to the Travelbag agency - is now selling flights from Luton to Budapest and the Polish industrial cities of Katowice, Gdansk and Warsaw.

  "<p>After a three-year slump, the economy is finally showing signs of picking up again. A slow loosening of the company purse strings is now translating into new IT spend. </p> <p>While many finance managers are keeping much tighter control over budgets compared to during the internet boom years, the signs are encouraging, especially for all those IT manufacturers anxious to influence the new technology wish lists of smaller businesses - which, combined, represent 80% of the corporate market. So, what's on those wish lists? </p> <p>A recent Microsoft survey found almost half of all UK small businesses - companies with fewer than 25 PC users - expect their IT budgets to increase over the next 12 months. \"The internet has made IT a 'must-have', even if it's just for filing tax returns electronically,\" says John Coulthard, head of small business at Microsoft UK. </p> <p>According to Microsoft's findings, 60% of budgets are being allocated to hardware, and, while the market is now almost saturated with desktop PCs, future growth will come from sales of portable systems and wireless technology. \"Portables have yet to pick up steam in the UK small business market, with a total installed base of 2m, compared to 8m desktops,\" Coulthard says.</p> <p>Indeed, many industry watchers claim that if there is to be a \"next big thing\" in IT again, it is likely to be in the area of mobile computing, as companies seek to make their staff more productive when they are away from the office. </p> <p>IT retailer PC World Business's sales figures certainly confirm this. The company, which has 111,000 business customers, the vast majority SMEs, reports a 66% growth in the volumes of wireless products sold over the last 12 months compared to the previous year. With huge advancements in 3G and Wi-Fi technology, and its availability, it sees this as the major growth area for the coming years. </p> <p>The decision to \"go mobile\" is, of course, much easier for the small or new business, which is, typically, agile enough to be able to embrace new technologies if the price and business case are right. Also, since fledgling firms often operate with a skeleton staff, the need to get the most from them is paramount.</p> <p>Take specialist management consultancy 7days. The company, which has a full-time team of 12, and turns over \u00a32m a year, has an IT budget for the current financial year of \u00a324,000. While its primary goal for the short term is to develop a stable and secure IT infrastructure, and an intranet-based knowledge management system, marketing and IT director Keith Gupwell notes that a medium-term goal is to achieve a \"true, wireless, location-independent, fast and secure wide-area network\". </p> <p>This would embrace the company's offices, client locations, airports and hotels, and would also include an option to integrate telephony into the infrastructure. \"As a growing consultancy, access to our shared knowledge base - from anywhere - will be critical,\" says Gupwell.</p> <p>The growing adoption of wireless technologies has spawned another trend too: a need for better integration between disparate systems. Traditionally, a problem that has bugged the large enterprise market, this is now gradually becoming an issue for smaller firms too as staff, and systems, become more mobile and, therefore, disjointed.</p> <p>According to the Integration Consortium (IC), an international, non-profit organisation that promotes best practices in integration, 40% of a company's budget is now allocated to integration, as it seeks to keep control over its dispersed company assets, ensuring it has a single, accurate view of critical business data.</p> <p>As a result, Steve Craggs, IC's vice chair, argues that web services are more likely to be the next big thing in IT. \"While these have been discussed for a couple of years, they have yet to be implemented on a large scale. This is the make or break year.\"</p> <p>Matthew Hopkins, managing director of software consultancy Dunstan Thomas, agrees: \"The next big thing is applications that talk to other applications over an internet connection. This is what we mean by web services and it is changing the way applications are being built, and, ultimately, how businesses work together. </p> <p>\"This will foster greater integration between applications inside the company and will encourage interoperability between companies - enhancing supply chain integration, for example.\"</p> <p>As companies seek to address issues of data integration, to ensure all staff are looking at the same, up-to-date contact details, for example, another \"boom\" in spending is likely to be in the field of Customer Relationship Management (CRM).</p> <p>While the large enterprise market's disappointment with early-generation CRM systems has been well documented, the need for a good customer management solution has not gone away. While smaller businesses tend to be closer to their customers, they too need a way of tracking customer contact so they can maintain high levels of personalised customer service - and grow repeat revenues.</p> <p>\"Over the next five years, the main focus for companies will be on re-engaging the customer, rather than seeing automated customer management as a way to cut costs,\" claims Nick Ogden, founder of internet payment system WorldPay, and now OnInstant, a business communications and voice over IP service. </p> <p>Key to achieving this is the convergence of voice and data on a single network, something which is now finally becoming a reality thanks to advances in technology and the backing of industry heavyweights, including BT. Such support is helping to boost the technology's credibility, achieve a critical mass and bring costs down.</p> <p>Rob Coyne, general manager, UK and Ireland at network manufacturer 3Com, says: \"For the smaller business, features such as call routing and unified messaging - the ability to access and manage emails, phone messages and faxes all in one place - can be invaluable when it comes to CRM.\"</p> <p>What's making this easier is the availability of CRM capabilities as a pay-as-you-go service, sourced as a hosted service over the internet. Here, your firm doesn't have to stump up vast amounts in advance for the software and systems to support this new functionality, and your internal IT person - if you have one - doesn't have one more package to support. Salesforce.com is enjoying great success with its on-demand CRM solution, which is still customisable, even though the companies using it don't own it outright. Many of the big names in CRM, such as Siebel, are also adopting this kind of delivery model as they seek to attract small business customers.</p> <p>According to the likes of PA Consulting, IBM and HP, utility computing - sourcing IT as you would a utility like electricity or a telephone service - could have the biggest impact since the birth of the internet, developing into a $50bn industry.</p> <p>As staff increasingly need remote access to business applications, a centralised, hosted model makes even more sense. Peter Gradwell, founder of internet service provider Gradwell dot com, says: \"Our customers want to be joined up with their corporate information while travelling, so if there's one area where small businesses will be spending over the next year, it's telecoms. </p> <p>He adds: \"The 'next big thing' will be the integration of 'presence' in telecoms and computers, so that when I look at 'John' in my address book, it says, 'Don't ring John now, I am in a meeting all morning'.\"</p> <p><strong>The IT wish list</strong></p> <p>Other top IT priorities for small businesses:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Security - whether protection against viruses and spam, or to complement the expected growth in mobile data access</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Broadband communications and IP VPNs - so that remote workers can access and share sensitive company data quickly and securely</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Power over ethernet - technology that allows low power consuming equipment, such as IP telephones, wireless access points and CCTV video cameras, to be powered over a standard data network</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Digital conferencing - a step towards videoconferencing, allowing remote co-workers, staff and customers to add value to phone calls or conferences by sharing documents electronically</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Business intelligence and search technologies - these tools will grow in importance as a means of managing critical business information</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Storage, backup and business continuity/disaster recovery solutions - these will have growing importance as companies grapple with new regulations concerning how data is managed</p>",
  "<p>Waiting up to five working days for a cheque to clear is annoying enough when it comes to personal banking. The funding gap is all the more galling when it is your business that suffers thanks to an outmoded and inefficient system.</p> <p>Business customers in Britain currently have to wait longer than almost all their western European counterparts for funds to pass through the clearing process. It takes at least three days for your money to be credited, whether the payment is by cheque or electronic transfer. Where cheques are used, it is more likely to be four or five days. Small firms can wait for up to 10 days for cheques to clear into their accounts, which is bad news for those with tight margins or cashflow.</p> <p>The Cruikshank Report of 2000 was highly critical of the fact that banks control the networks that channel money around the economy, but little has changed since then. Earlier in the summer, Bank of England governor Mervyn King expressed his disappointment over our sluggish clearing system to assembled bankers at the Lord Mayor's Banquet in the City of London. Somewhat controversially, King asked why banks could not put the same \"innovative flair\" they displayed in making money to use in improving the clearing system. </p> <p>There were no reports of any of the bankers skipping pudding to get started on the problem, but when you consider the fact that payment delays save banks millions of pounds in interest each year, that's hardly surprising.</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses, a lobbying organisation that represents 185,000 of Britain's SMEs, was quick to praise King's stance. National chairman Carol Undy said: \"The UK is now taking longer to clear payments than almost any other G10 country. It should, given today's technology, not take three days for a customer to clear a cheque or receive an electronic payment.\"</p> <p>Why does clearing take so long? With cheques, there is a physical transfer as well as an electronic exchange of funds. According to the Association of Payment Clearing Services, which operates the UK's clearing systems, paper transactions are processed in a three-day cycle. On day one, the cheque is processed and the information is passed electronically through a data exchange network. The next day, the cheque is delivered to a centre where banks exchange customers' cheques. On the third day, bank staff review the cheque presented for payment and make decisions about whether to pay or return it. Settlement between the members, for the net values of the cheques exchanged between them, takes place over their Bank of England settlement accounts on day three. </p> <p>In total, nearly 12m cheques are written every day and about two-thirds pass through the inter-bank clearing. Given the volume of exchanges and the physical element of a paper transaction, this can never be an instantaneous process, so a two or three-day delay is understandable.</p> <p>The same cannot be said for electronic payments. While cheque writing is a dying art, BACS handles 3.5bn transactions a year. This number is to increase to 5bn by 2006. On a busy day, the system deals with 60m transactions. But why does it still take up to four days for a BACS payment to clear? Unsurprisingly, it all comes down to making money.</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses has accused banks of stalling the process to gain extra profits, and the Consumers' Association estimates that banks make more than \u00a330m a year in interest from investing money sent by electronic transfer.</p> <p>The good news is that the Office of Fair Trading has set up the Payment Systems Taskforce to look at the clearing issue over the next four years. With members drawn from banking, finance, consumer and business bodies, the taskforce has had two meetings this year and has the power to bring in legislation to speed up clearing if there is not an improvement in the system in the next four years. </p> <p>On the electronic side, a \u00a375m overhaul of the transfer system has begun, but the result, says BACS, will be a shaving of just one day off the current waiting time for funds. For the moment, unless you can find someone to do business with who deals solely in hard cash - which is, perhaps, inadvisable - the only solution is to grin and bear it, and make sure your cashflow can accommodate delays.</p> <p><strong>Useful tips</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The clearing system isn't going to speed up any time soon. Until it does, you must do everything you can to ensure your cashflow can handle delays.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Firstly, be aware of how long you may have to wait for monies to appear in your account. Give yourself at least seven working days' leeway and ensure you have sufficient extra to cover any temporary shortfall.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ensure you have a good relationship with your bank. An agreed overdraft facility will absorb any funding gap caused by delays in clearing.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Having a range of clients helps, as this will stagger the payments coming into your account.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Online banking is a useful way of tracking your cashflow to see whether funds have cleared. When looking for a business bank account, shop around using the independent financial data website <a href=\"http://www.moneyfacts.co.uk\">moneyfacts.co.uk</a>.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Are you worried about your company's communications? According to a survey by Emphasis Training, you probably ought to be, since it found that one in five business documents was badly written. This might not seem to matter much except that the cost to the economy is, claims the training company, costing billions per year. The waste comes from people having to wade through the many badly written documents and work out what they actually mean. Chief among the faults were bad grammar, unexplained acronyms and misuse of jargon. The survey was launched to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Plain English campaign.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Insurance company AXA has issued a report that suggests there's a new risk to business: the rise of the litigation culture. The company's survey said 36% of SMEs believed litigation was a threat, and 23% of senior executives had been involved in litigation of some sort. Only 69% of companies appeared to be aware of their liabilities and only 47% had taken out any insurance to cover litigation. Many of the respondents felt litigation was on the increase - one, for example, cited a Scottish employee who had taken legal action over her boss imitating her accent, and won. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Institute of IT Training is to kick off a new award scheme for \"freelance trainer of the year\". It will be sponsored by freelance training agency Broadskill. Judges will be looking for excellent references, proven case histories and some sort of consistency in the quality of the training on offer. More information is available at www.ittrainingawards.com. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> It's looking safe to say August has, for parts of the UK, been a pretty typical British summer, with heavy rain and serious floods. It is, therefore, worth considering what a company would do in the event of a flood, which has led specialist document recovery company DocumentSOS to make flood recovery the theme of its \"Keeping Afloat\" event this year. Set to take place at London's Royal Geographical Society on November 2, anyone signing up early can get in for \u00a370, which includes six months' DocumentSOS membership. Further information is available at <a href=\"http://www.documentsos.com\">www.documentsos.com</a>. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Communications specialist izR Solutions has launched what it describes as the UK's first low-cost broadband package, although since many are now around at under \u00a320 a month, you'd have to query that. The unique thing about izR's offer is that it's a pay-as-you-go set-up, and will be suitable only for the business owner/manager since it's available only in the evenings and weekends. The idea is to use some of the spare bandwidth available when the company's core business customers are offline. BT has responded with its own pay-as-you-go package, which it is reportedly testing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Small software house LookOut has been bought by Microsoft. The company will continue to give away its LookOut searching software, which can be added to Microsoft Outlook and a number of other email systems; with it, searching through an archive of emails and a hard disk full of documents takes a fraction of the time it normally would. The software is available for free at <a href=\"http://www.lookoutsoft.com\">www.lookoutsoft.com</a> and will turn up on the MSN website as well. It's hoped they'll make it sensitive to UK date formats as well as American ones as it becomes used more widely. It has a new competitor, however, in the shape of Blinkx, which searches the web, publicly available video and the local disk as well. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> People who complain about the UK's data protection laws may be getting a fillip from an unlikely source; the EU is concerned that British law might be out of step with the European directive on the subject. The query came over the definition of \"personal data\" following a case involving the Financial Services Authority. It is known for certain that the commission has written to the data protection registrar, but the content of the letter has yet to be placed on the record. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> It's official: online conferences don't work for business. At least so says Doctor Mark Smith, chairman of Nemisys Enterprises and one of the pioneers of online conferencing. Having run the first online conference in 1997, you might expect him to push the idea as being a cert for making a profit, but he has now announced he's seen too many online systems packed out with spurious advertising and extra content which bankrolls the technology but distracts the participant. He believes that the best use of online conferencing now is in a not-for-profit area, in which making money isn't as important as sharing information.</p>",
  "<p>Did our quadrupedal, pre-hominid ancestors lead a semi-aquatic existence before emerging as the hairless bipeds we eventually became? So suggests the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis (AAH), an alternative human evolutionary model that has proved enduringly popular. </p> <p>Alister Hardy, a respected marine biologist, first presented Homo aquaticus to the British Sub Aqua Club in 1960, following with several New Scientist articles. He'd originally conceived the AAH in 1927, after watching sea mammals being dismembered, but decided to keep it to himself, not wishing to jeopardise his career prospects. </p> <p>The central idea is that our tree-dwelling ancestors began to hunt on seashores, eventually entering the water to catch crabs and fish. Several evolutionary developments resulted: the apes lost the bulk of their body hair, the remaining strands aiding the flow of water over their bodies as they swam; they developed a more upright posture, supported by the water; their fingertips grew more sensitive as they felt around for food; they grew a layer of subcutaneous fat - found only in other aquatic mammals - to keep themselves insulated; they become adept swimmers, and used stones to crack open shells. Their remains were, rather conveniently, swept out to sea, explaining the lack of sea monkey fossils. </p> <p>While it raised a few eyebrows, Hardy's theory had been largely forgotten when it re-emerged in 1972, thanks to Elaine Morgan, a TV scriptwriter with no science background. She adopted the AAH for her feminist anthropological treatise, The Descent of Woman, adding a few touches, most importantly that, to give their offspring something to cling onto, the female aquaticus retained the hair on her head and grew larger breasts than her earthbound cousins. </p> <p>The book had a big impact on its lay readers, but incurred the wrath of anthropologists and paleontologists, who decried its non-scientific approach. Morgan pressed on, however, refining her ideas, and her language, in follow-ups including The Aquatic Ape (1982) and The Scars of Evolution (1990). </p> <p>Undoubtedly appealing, the AAH has been repeatedly rejected by the evolutionary establishment and, just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water, Morgan's arguments convincingly refuted on almost every count.</p>",
  "Hugh Shearer, who has died aged 81, governed Jamaica during a watershed period of Caribbean history. The heroic figures leading the island colonies to independence from Britain were uneasily confronting the new \"black power\" movement imported from the United States civil rights struggle, which challenged their authenticity and authority. The region's traditional plantation crops were giving way to a broader economic base of tourism and manufacturing, and this, too, disturbed the social order. <p>The humbly born Shearer began his career at 18 as an official with the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (Bitu), the country's biggest union and the industrial arm of the conservative Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). Both were dominated for 40 years by their tempestuous founder, Sir Alexander Bustamante, Jamaica's first prime minister, in whose shadow he toiled much of his life. </p> <p>Shearer became an MP in 1955, but lost his seat four years later. When Bustamante became ill in 1964, he made Shearer unofficial head of the union and Donald Sangster the acting prime minister. At the 1967 election, won again by the JLP, Bustamante retired in favour of Sangster and handed over his parliamentary seat to Shearer, who became foreign minister. </p> <p>When Sangster died six weeks later, Shearer was picked to succeed him as prime minister. He was faced with demands for greater economic and social justice, presented as black rights, then a touchy issue in Jamaica, where colour differences were sharper than elsewhere in the Anglo-Caribbean. </p> <p>The spark was provided by Walter Rodney, a young Guyanese lecturer at the local University of the West Indies campus and apostle of the new movement. He urged students and poor Jamaicans to revolt against the country's colonial structures and raised the spectre of class war. </p> <p>When Rodney went on a brief trip abroad in October 1968, Shearer refused to allow him back into the country. The several days of rioting and destruction that followed - known as the Rodney Riots - plus a ban on \"black power\" and socialist literature by the panicked ruling elite, became a rallying point for the region's burgeoning new left and for demands that Caribbean social problems be seriously tackled. </p> <p>Shearer's Canute-like gesture undermined his authority, despite impressive economic growth figures and an extensive school-building programme. He was damaged, too, by over-identifying with Bustamante in efforts to establish himself. He also faced a charismatic rival in Michael Manley, leader of the opposi tion People's National Party who, though upper-class, adopted third-world, populist, regional, black power and Rastafarian themes, presenting himself as a more modern leader and pointing to the JLP as a tool of the brown and white elite and bastion of a bygone order. </p> <p>The gentlemanly Shearer was also being shunted aside by a cabal of light-skinned ministers in his government and, after Manley's landslide victory in the 1972 general election, he came under attack from their leader, the US-born Lebanese-Jamaican Edward Seaga, who seized control of the JLP from him in 1974. </p> <p>When Seaga, helped by covert US efforts to destabilise Manley's leftwing government, won the 1980 elections, he made it up to Shearer by naming him as token deputy prime minister and foreign minister with the brief of cutting ties with neighbouring Cuba and firmly aligning Jamaica with the US. </p> <p>He was used as a deceptively gentle face of a government whose economic harshness and cold-war policies aped those of President Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and shocked many in the region. When the JLP was beaten at the polls in 1989, Shearer returned to his lifelong work of running the Bitu. </p> <p>He was twice married and leaves a son and two daughters. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Hugh Shearer, politician and trade unionist, born May 18 1923; died July 5 2004.</p>",
  "The Czech professor and politician Ota Sik, who has died aged 84, was the brain behind the economic reforms of communist Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring. He was also one of the most radical, trenchant and outspoken members of the team of communist reformers who rallied to Alexander Dubcek's leadership in 1968. <p>A liberal leftist in the communist bloc, 20 years before Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika threw up a host of likeminded figures in the Soviet Union, Sik defied the orthodoxies in the early 1960s to argue for root-and-branch overhaul of dogmatic Marxist economics that had reduced the Czech lands, historically an advanced economy, to poverty, shortages and economic irrationality. </p> <p>The part-Jewish survivor of a Nazi concentration camp eventually forced his thinking on the Stalinist Czechoslovak leadership of the early 1960s. He then became a key figure in the Dubcek team, only to have his policies first sabotaged by the hardline communist apparatus and then abandoned wholesale following the Soviet invasion in August 1968, which ushered in 20 years of repression and servility to Moscow. </p> <p>Sik was born in the western Czech industrial town of Plzen in 1919, just as the new state of Czechoslovakia was born from the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian empire and began embarking on a relatively happy two decades of democracy. He studied art in Prague before the second world war and politics after 1945, before becoming a pioneering economist. </p> <p>After the Nazis first lopped off the Sudetenland and then partitioned Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Sik joined the resistance. He was picked up by the Gestapo in 1940 and sent to Mauthausen, the main Nazi concentration camp in Austria where fellow inmates included Alexander Dubcek's father Stefan and Antonin Novotny, the Czech Stalinist leader whose replacement by Alexander Dubcek as Czechoslovak communist party chief in January 1968 triggered the helter-skelter eight-month experiment in \"socialism with a human face\", crushed by the Soviet Union. </p> <p>Sik's camp connections proved useful. He used his wartime experiences with Novotny to cajole the hardliner into loosening rigid central planning in the early 1960s, by which time the Czech economy had ground to a halt. Seldom lost for an acid turn of phrase, Sik ridiculed orthodox Soviet economics and complained that alone in the eastern bloc Czechoslovakia had \"liquidated, for dogmatic reasons, even the last cobbler\". </p> <p>A leftist professor of eco nomics since the end of the war, and a Communist party member, Sik sought to inject market elements into central planning, to relax price controls and to promote private enterprise. By the early 1960s he was on the party's central committee and chief of the prestigious economics institute of the Academy of Sciences, where he formed a brains trust of reformist colleagues and began working on his new economic model. </p> <p>The Czech lands, as opposed to Slovakia, have a proud economic and industrial history. By the late 19th-century they comprised one of the most advanced economies in Europe and provided the industrial powerhouse of the late Habsburg empire. War and then communism put paid to that. By the early 1960s, the Czechs were suffering the lowest standards of living in the Soviet bloc. </p> <p>Sik's reforms were launched in 1967, even before Dubcek came to power, but were wrecked by party apparatchiks fearful of losing control of the factories. The most palpable and popular change was the introduction of private taxis in Prague. But the reform package was emasculated by Novotny loyalists. </p> <p>By December 1967, at a crucial party meeting prefiguring Dubcek's coup against Novotny a month later, Sik delivered an impassioned denunciation of the Czech regime, demanding fundamental change to the communist system and a new government. The country's economic survival was at stake, he thundered. Economic reforms could not be divorced from fundamental political change - the same conclusion reached by Gorbachev two decades later. </p> <p>With Dubcek triumphant, Sik was made a deputy prime minister the following April at the height of the Prague Spring and was the architect of the economics part of the Dubcek team's action programme - policies, he pledged, that would put Czechoslovakia on a par with neighbouring Austria within four years if followed. By August, the plans were being shredded beneath the treads of Warsaw Pact tanks. </p> <p>Sik went on holiday to Yugoslavia at the beginning of August that year, and did not return to face arrest by the Russians. Leonid Brezhnev's Kremlin and propaganda apparatus singled out Sik for particular opprobrium. Just after the invasion, the Soviet news agency Tass described him as an agent of US imperialism and \"one of the most odious figures of the rightwing revisionists\". </p> <p>In fact, he remained a leftist till the end. He became a harsh critic of the monetarist policies of Vaclav Klaus, finance minister, then prime minister, following the 1989 velvet revolution, and now Czech president. </p> <p>From holiday in Yugoslavia in August 1968, Sik fled to Switzerland that October, and by 1970 was teaching economics at the university in St Gallen, a professorship he held for 20 years. A naturalised Swiss citizen, he died in that country. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife; they had two sons. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ota Sik, economist and politician, born September 11 1919; died August 22 2004</p>",
  "<p><strong>Every Picture Tells a Story</strong><br> 7.30pm, Five<br> Waldemar Januszczak offers some intriguing insights into exactly why Edouard Manet's painting Le D\u00e9jeuner Sur l'Herbe caused such a storm when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The art world was appalled, offended and outraged; Dante Gabriel Rossetti went so far as to call Manet an idiot and an ass. The reasons for the anger went beyond the obvious ones of showing a nude woman having a picnic with two men wearing contemporary clothes. What is interesting to see is how Manet used his own background to subvert the conventions of respectability and also to break free from the shackles of the past. </p> <p><strong>Going to Extremes</strong><br> 8pm, Channel 4<br> Fifty-year-old Pam has had a tough life, and one of the things that sustained her was her dream of spending time with a tribe in the South American rainforest.

  "We've had it all wrong. For years, we thought that page three amounted to little more than the pornographic degradation of women, but it transpires that the Sun stalwart is up there with throwing yourself in front of a horse in terms of female emancipation. And it took Shell from Big Brother to inform us of this fact, while posing without her brassiere in that very paper on Monday. \"Those who sneer at page three lack intelligence,\" she explains. \"It's beautifully shot and tastefully pioneered the celebration of the female form,\" she continues, before suggesting that page threes should hang in the Tate. The following day, the Sun featured the gay wedding of another Big Brother contestant, Kitten, who confusingly was also a feminist - an \"arch-feminist\", even - but less sportingly wore all her clothes, which made her look \"like a man\". But, back to Shell on the politics of page three: \"In many ways, it emancipated women, letting them exploit their assets, earn cash and keep control. I see it as a modern art form.\" By which fuzzy logic, Ms Jubin, you'll also be classing prostitution as a modern art form, will you? <p>And perhaps that's all Wayne Rooney has been up to. Upon finding the doors of Tate Liverpool shut in the early hours of the morning, he had no choice but to take himself to the nearest brothel in search of some cultural nourishment. There, sadly, the lady of the night spent her time with Mr Rooney merely contemplating which Pot Noodle to eat on her break. Admittedly, all that lying back and thinking of England becomes rather redundant when one is lying back with one of the England squad. But which would you have chosen? Chicken and mushroom, or beef and tomato? It's a question that is surely dividing the good women of Britain. </p> <p>As Virginia Woolf so wisely said, \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.\" The Hosking Houses Trust is currently offering both, in the form of a year-long salaried literary fellowship, to \"a professional woman writer of merit over the age of 40\". \"Older women have a rough do,\" says Sarah Hosking, the charity's founder. \"Once you're grey, no one sees you when you come into a room.\" She is seeking a woman with \"a stonking good idea\" for a book, fiction or non-fiction, who needs time and space and solitude in which to let that idea grow.

  "Russian authorities struggled last night to explain how two passenger aircraft had apparently blown up simultaneously in midair on Tuesday night, killing all 89 people on board. <p>The owners of the two aircraft, aviation experts and relatives of the dead said the coincidence was too great for it not to be a terrorist act. Russia's security service, the FSB, said it had yet to find any evidence of a bomb or a hijack, although it did not rule out the possibility. </p> <p>The two planes, a Tupolev-154, with 46 Russians on board, bound for the southern beach resort of Sochi, and a Tupolev-134, carrying 43 people to the southern town of Volgograd, took off on Tuesday from Moscow's Domodyedovo airport at 9.35pm and 10.15pm respectively. </p> <p>At 10.56pm, the 134 disappeared from air traffic controllers' radar, falling from 10,000 metres to crash near the town of Tula, 125 miles south of Moscow. The 154 fell to the ground from its flight path three minutes later. Its remains were scattered across a field near Rostov-on-Don, 620 miles south of the capital. </p> <p>President Vladimir Putin cut short his holiday in Sochi and ordered the FSB to investigate and set up a commission into the crashes. Last night he expressed his condolences to the victims' relatives at a meeting with law enforcement chiefs, and declared today a day of mourning. </p> <p>Security was stepped up at Russian airports, but the Kremlin made no official statement over whether the crashes were caused by terrorism. </p> <p>Investigators in blue and orange overalls combed the wreckage of the two planes, their luggage, chairs, and twisted shells scattered amid the tall grass. The charred corpses of holidaymakers bound for Sochi, and businessmen heading to Volgograd, were found in the fuselages. All the passengers and crew were Russians, except for one Israeli businessman bound for Volgograd. </p> <p>Eyewitnesses said they had heard explosions before both crashes. Sergei Korzayev, a resident of Buchalki, near Tula, told Rossiya state television: \"There was an explosion first, then the plane fell before I heard two more bangs. At first we thought it was thunder [from the storm raging], but it grew louder, like cannon fire, and then fell silent.\" </p> <p>The FSB said its initial investigations had yet to show \"any evidence that can confirm this was a terrorist act\". Sergei Ignatchenko, head of the FSB's press office, said: \"We are working on all possibilities, including terrorism. We do not have any information about an explosion.\" Poor safety, fuel, pilot error, plane maintenance and even bad weather conditions were also being examined, he said. </p> <p>He declined to comment on any investigation into the passenger list, and said that six people who had been too late for the Sochi flight had had their baggage returned to them, and were simply \"lucky\". </p> <p>The crashes came at a time of heightened alert in Russia, where elections for a new president in the war-torn republic of Chechnya will take place on Sunday. Chechnya's last president, Akhmed Kadyrov, was assassinated by militant separatists in May, who have pledged further attacks on Russia in the run up to install a successor. </p> <p>Akhmed Zakayev, a spokesman for the Chechen rebels, said they were not responsible for the air disasters. </p> <p>If Tuesday's crashes were terrorist acts, they would be the worst loss of civilian life to terrorism in Mr Putin's four-year rule. Air travel is a vital bridge across Russia's 11 time zones. </p> <p>The owners of the second plane, the 154 bound for Sochi, said that the plane had sent an emergency signal moments before its crash indicating that it had been hijacked. But Sergei Kovalyov, president of Russia's Federal Union of Air Traffic Controllers, said officials had told him the 154 had issued a general distress call, that did not specify the nature of the problem. </p> <p>He said that normally a plane appears as a single line on the controller's display, but when the distress signal is activated, another line appears. \"Then the controller will expect further information from the plane's systems, giving its flight number, altitude, destination and also a [four figure] code which says whether it is either a technical problem, a radio fault, or a hijacking.\" He said the 154's crew did not have time to send this further information. </p> <p>Yet he said he believed that terrorists were responsible. \"When you see two simultaneous, identical events, it is difficult to imagine anything else.\"</p>",
  "A British journalist, Ewa Jasiewicz, was ordered to be deported from Israel yesterday after a court ruled that her \"naivety\" could be exploited by Palestinian militants. <p>Jasiewicz, 26, a freelance journalist who writes for the leftwing monthly Red Pepper, went to court after being refused entry to the country on August 11. She has been detained at Ben Gurion airport since then. </p> <p>As well as working as a journalist, Jasiewicz has also worked as a human rights activist in the West Bank. </p> <p>She is to appeal against the decision. The court granted her a 48-hour reprieve to allow her to take the appeal to the supreme court. </p> <p>The editor of Red Pepper, Hilary Wainwright, said the suggestion of naivety was absurd. \"Anyone who cares about democracy and freedom of the press must urge the British government to intervene,\" she said. </p> <p>Yael Barda, Jasiewicz's lawyer, said: \"Two judges in Israel have decided that Ms Jasiewicz is not a security threat, yet they have denied her entry into Israel because of her ideological beliefs.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile the head of a Palestinian security agency was seriously injured yesterday in an assassination attempt in Gaza City. </p> <p>Two of his bodyguards were killed when their two-car convoy was ambushed by three gunmen. </p> <p>Tareq Abu Rajab, the acting head of the general intelligence service, is an old ally of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. </p> <p>He played a leading role in suppressing Hamas in 1997 and it has been suggested that this might have been a revenge attack. </p> <p>The shooting was the latest in a series of incidents in Gaza City, but the first this month. In July there was a wave of kidnappings and other protests directed at corrupt figures, which were seen as an indirect protest against Mr Arafat. </p> <p>Sources close to Mr Arafat blamed Mohammad Dahlan, a popular member of the Fatah party in Gaza for the unrest. </p> <p>This week Mr Dahlan visited Mr Arafat in Ramallah and sources said the problem had been \"contained\".</p>",

So fantasies about 220 medals are a bit misleading,\" writes Raymond Sontag, who I presume is picking up the thread of a discussion that was taking place before I came in tonight. I could scroll back to see what it's all about, but complete indifference means that I'm happy just to take the baton and run with it. Well, plod. </p> <p> <strong>7pm:</strong> I glance away from the television for 30 seconds, only to return my attention to it and see that the BBC's Olympics coverage has been replaced by some naff quiz show called Headpresented by ubiquitous, mullet-sporting, twinkly-eyed, Bolton-born, grinning idiot and mass-purveyor of televisual tat, Vernon Kay. There's no need for that. Thankfully, a quick press of my digit on the TV remote reveals that the Olympic coverage has been shunted back to its rightful place on BBC1. Imagine if I hadn't noticed the difference ...</p> <p> <strong>6.51pm:</strong> Great Britain's Chris Tomlinson does his confidence a power of good by nailing his first effort in the men's long jump final. The white flag goes up and 8.25m flashes up on the scoreboard. It's enough to put him in the silver medal position, but not for long. With his second jump, John Moffitt does 8.28m, relegating Tomlinson to third place after the first round. </p> <p> <strong>6.45pm:</strong> Greetings all. Barry Glendenning here. Late. Again. I knew you were all waiting but I didn't care. Kelly Holmes qualifies for the final of the women's 1500m, doing her usual trick of trailing at the back of the field for the first two-and-a-half laps or so, before moving towards the front in the last 300m. She finishes confidently in second behind Russia's Natalia Yevdokimova, thus ensuring her place in tomorrow's final. </p> <p> <strong>6pm</strong> In the absence of anything of even the vaguest interest going on in Athens, I'll leave you to proudly swell your chest, lay your hand on your heart, and warble the National Anthem at the top of your lungs:</p> <p>\"US athletes have no reason to be smug - their performance, based on pretty much any type of relative standard eg. population, GDP per capita has been poor. Bahamas, New Zealand and Australia are probably the best per head of population at this stage. I am not British, but I think you sell yourselves a bit short sometimes - in relative terms you are probably outperforming the US.\" </p> <p>Barry Glendenning will be here in the next half hour or so to check on the progress of the evening's events.</p> <p><strong>5.48pm</strong> Germany could have buried the game about ten times over this half, and Sweden have just lifted another ball on to the top of the net. The Swedes will feel hard done by to lose this game.</p> <p>I can't really print Bruce Jackson's response to John Vastano's smug American boasting, but let's just say the words \"steroid-pumped\" and \"morons\" feature. For legal reasons, I cannot possible say in which order or between which other words.</p> <p><strong>5.40pm</strong> Chances at both ends in the football - Sweden surviving going another goal down thanks to some goalmouth scrambling, and there are five minutes to go.</p> <p>\"While the Games today have been entertaining, I've been more excited with the promise of what might happen to Mark Thatcher. Is that so wrong?\" Does anyone else get the feeling Jonathan Keith wants me to tell him it is? I'm sure I've never mentioned those kind of services on my card...</p> <p><strong>5.32pm</strong> Somehow, Germany are still winning 1-0, despite the fact that this game has kept the keepers busier than Wayne Rooney on 2-for-1 nights.</p> <p>In the kind of role reversal that could well see me clearing my desk this evening, I have been reliably informed that Argentina scored a goal in the last couple of minutes of that bronze hockey match, to win 1-0. </p> <p>Bet you didn't know Tamer Bayoumi of Egypt had beaten Juan Ramos of Spain 7-1 in the men's Taekwondo, did you? Actually, I'm not putting money on that.</p> <p><strong>5.25pm</strong> \"That would be fine with the U.S. - recall that as one team you would only be able to send one team to each team sport, only 3 each to each athletics event - or you could let the U.S send its top several dozen sprinters in each event, that might be a fun meet,\" says John Vastano. \"Just a wee reality check...\" Americans. So smug. See how you take a reality check when you've got the bunch of chumps out on track that we're made to suffer..</p> <p>Sweden are still a goal down by the way.</p> <p><strong>5.14pm</strong> \"I'm ignoring the debate between the Scots and Welsh to propose an EU olympics team instead,\" says Paul Brown, brazenly papering over the fact that this exact proposal has been made approximately 37,462 times already since Athens kicked off. \"Currently we would top the table with a mighty 62 Golds and 220 medals in total, compared to the USA's measly 25 Golds and 77 medals in total. Although Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Luxembourg have been absolutely no help whatsoever so far, so if someone could have a word with Peter Mandelson about getting them kicked out that would be great.\"</p> <p>Still Germany 1-0 Sweden in the women's football bronze, and you have to have the World Cup winners down as favourites to take this now.</p> <p>Paul Lofthouse wants to know what's happening in the bronze medal match in the women's hockey. China 0-0 Argentina, I think.</p> <p><strong>5.05pm</strong> Evening folks. I will do my best to keep you up to date with who's kicking whose head in whatever random martial art is going on this afternoon, but I must admit I'm caught up in a great bronze medal match between Germany and Sweden in the women's football at the moment. The Germans are 1-0 up so far, incidentally.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday August 31 2004</strong></p> <p>In the article below, we reported GlaxoSmithKline as saying that \"animal rights extremism is not a factor in its decision to go to Singapore, and the unit is not shipping out the experiments carried out on monkeys and apes that attract the most outrage from anti-vivisection groups\". Glaxo does not use apes in medical research anywhere in the world. </p> <p></p> <p>Many countries, including Britain, aspire to attract pharmaceutical companies to carry out research on their home turf. Western governments are keen to create a highly skilled workforce as a competitive edge against the cheap labour in the far east. </p> <p>Now Singapore is making inroads into this sector. Its weapon is 3bn Singapore dollars (\u00a31bn) of government cash, which is being used to make the country biotech-friendly in the five years ending in 2005. The country is close to signing a deal with UK drugs group GlaxoSmithKline to set up a research house that will investigate drugs for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases. </p> <p>The number of scientists Glaxo is hiring is small relative to its British operations: about 30, compared with its estimated 6,000 in the UK. But the area of research is highly skilled and just the sort of investment Britain cannot afford to lose if it is to keep its global number two position in biomedical research and pharmaceuticals. </p> <p>Pharmaceuticals firms have been manufacturing drugs in Singapore since the early 70s, when Beecham set up a factory to make antibiotics, primarily for the Japanese market. Others soon followed, attracted by the 0% corporation tax that manufacturers are offered as well as the fact that English is the first language. Growth in healthcare manufacturing output grew 16% last year to S$11bn and the country plans to get this up to S$20bn by the end of the decade. </p> <p>Now it wants to attract the highly skilled research that the UK and US excel at, and has succeeded in luring Glaxo, Swiss firm Novartis as well as small British and American biotechnology companies. Top scientists such as Alan Colman, who led the team that brought us Dolly the cloned sheep, and Martin Hibberd at Imperial College are relocating. The country is trying to create a new force in international biomedical research. </p> <p>\"It is an effort by Singapore to add a new growth area to the economy and complement manufacturing,\" said Dr Beh Swan Gin, director of biomedical sciences for the economic development board. \"Biotechnology represents the knowledge-based economy. The initiative is fundamentally about diversifying [the country's] portfolio.\" </p> <p>So far, it has persuaded a dozen or so biomedical sciences firms to set up research operations there, including Paradigm Therapeutics from the UK and US firms Isis Pharmaceutical and Vanda Pharmaceuticals. </p> <p>\"Singapore is increasingly becoming a country of excellence in biomedical research, it makes sense tto research out there,\" said a Glaxo spokesperson. \"We want to be part of what is happening in Singapore in terms of bioscience.\" According to the Singapore government, Glaxo intends to double its laboratory space for early stage drug development. </p> <p><strong> Violent activists</strong></p> <p> To drugs research firms, a significant attraction of Singapore when compared to the UK is its strict law and ruthless policing. The pharmaceutical industry in Britain is under threat from violent animal rights activists and a \"tendency to blow up scientists\", as Paul Herrling, the chairman of Novartis's new research unit in Singapore that will look at new treatments for dengue fever and tuberculosis, puts it. </p> <p>Glaxo says that animal rights extremism is not a factor in its decision to go to Singapore, and the unit is not shipping out the experiments carried out on monkeys and apes that attract the most outrage from anti-vivisection groups. </p> <p>The main attraction is hard cash. Companies in the hi-tech sectors do not have to pay any corporation tax. And when research is loss-making, the Singapore government will match every pound spent with 50p in research grants - no strings attached. </p> <p>It has also set up a S$1bn venture capital fund under which the government will take a shareholding in the company in return for a cash injection, although this is most attractive to smaller biotechnology firms. </p> <p>One of the downsides for companies was the small number of trained scientists in Singapore. So the government is funding 1,000 extra students to do PhDs either at home or abroad. It has built a brand new science park called Biopolis, where the country's academic researchers are now housed and biotechnology companies are encouraged to rent office space, so that the private and public sector can interact. </p> <p>The fact there are fewer workers' rights also makes the country more attractive. As one service industry worker in Singapore remarked, \"in Europe you have human rights, here we are machines\". </p> <p>Staff costs can be up to 25% lower than in Britain, according to Mark Carlton, chief executive of UK drug discovery firm Paradigm Therapeutics, which has opened a research facility in Singapore. \"That makes it very favourable: you have a highly motivated workforce all being retrained in the biotech area,\" he says. \"They live to work, basically.\" </p> <p>Singapore has also made its rules and regulations attractive. The pharmaceuticals industry tests its potential products on large numbers of animals before it tries them out on humans. </p> <p>The country has developed streamlined rules and regulations which are not as bureaucratic as those in Europe. It has also taken advantage of what is in effect a ban on stem cell research in America by signing a deal with the US-based Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International to carry out such studies in the island state. </p> <p>Although Singapore has made some fast leaps in the industry, it is far from reaching the status of western Europe and the US. But could it one day rival the west to be an industry leader? \"It depends how the Chinese market develops,\" said Paradigm's Mr Carlton. \"Singapore is a springboard into Japan and Asia, and everyone is watching what's going on in China with great anticipation - it will be a great new outlet for drugs being developed. </p> <p>\"Singapore is a very easy nation in which to work, it is very stable, etcetera. We will have to see how the industry matures, but I see no reason why it won't be highly competitive.\" </p> <p>Singapore insists that it is not trying to steal the industry from the west. \"We only need a very small slice of the pie,\" said Dr Beh. \"We want to play a complementary role, and be part of the international community. The west will always remain very important research centres.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US team finally got its act together today to beat Spain in a tense, close-fought and ultimately acrimonious quarter-final in Athens.</p> <p>Officials had to separate the respective coaches after they became embroiled in a heated bout of mutual finger-pointing at the end of the game, which finished 102-94 in the Americans' favour. The game itself was also littered with infractions, particularly during a final quarter in which the frustrated Spanish just couldn't break down a stubborn American defence..</p> <p>The game had been a see-saw struggle from the start. It was level 25-25 after the first quarter, before the NBA stars began to edge ahead. They led by one point after the second quarter and by seven after the third. The Spanish closed to within four points in the final quarter, before Stephon Marbury sealed the win with a three pointer. </p> <p>Marbury had scored only 21 points in the US's first five games, but his 31 today was one better than the previous US points record for one game.</p> <p>\"Coming into the Olympics I hadn't played all summer so I wasn't in my rhythm,\" said Marbury afterwards. \"But I have taken some extra shooting practice to get it back.\" </p> <p>The three-times gold medallists had started the game in the strange position of being underdogs after losing to both Puerto Rico and Lithuania in a preliminary round which had seen Spain go undefeated.</p> <p>However, the defending champions will now be strong favourites to beat the winner of the Argentina/Greece quarter final and advance to the final .</p> <p>In the second quarter final this afternoon, the Lithuanians beat China 95 - 75.</p>",
  "<p>BIG CUP DRAW</p> <p>Usually the Big Cup first-round draw is even easier to predict than Duncan Goodhew's latest hair-do.

Still, Arsenal's task in Group E (E for easy?) is even more straightforward - they've got Panathinaikos, PSV Eindhoven and Rosenborg. \"We're not that unhappy but it's always tough - there are no easy games,\" said Arsenal director Danny Fiszman, fooling no one.</p> <p>But what of Jose \"Fingers\" Mourinho, you ask?

Rooney's relationship with his fiancee is apparently as healthy as George Best's old liver after a chance meeting with Alex Higgins, Shane McGowan and 15 bottles of 96.6% proof rum, and now Everton have rejected Manchester United's \u00a320m bid for him! (And an improved offer from Newcastle as well, which the Fiver feels compelled to report even though it doesn't matter one iota because everyone knows he's not going there.)

  "Sir Mark Thatcher was planning a move from South Africa to Texas when he was arrested over alleged involvement in a coup plot, a South African prosecutor said today. <p>Margaret Thatcher's son is under house arrest and facing the possibility of 15 years in prison after being accused over an alleged plot to overthrow the government of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea. </p> <p>The 51-year-old, who denies the charge, was arrested at his Cape Town home early yesterday, and appeared in court in the city later that day. </p> <p>Makhosini Nkosi, a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority, today said: \"It does appear that he was planning to leave the country. </p> <p>\"The house was on the market, he had disposed of some of the cars, and there were suitcases around the house which indicated they were planning to leave. He did confirm he was planning to relocate to Texas.\" </p> <p>Sir Mark has been charged with violating South Africa's anti-mercenary law in connection with the alleged coup attempt. Prosecutors allege that he helped finance a purported attempt to overthrow Equatorial Guinea's controversial president, Teodoro Obiang. </p> <p>Seventy people are on trial in Zimababwe in connection with the alleged plot. The majority of them were arrested at an airport in Harare in March, where they had been aboard a plane allegedly bound for Equatorial Guinea. Another 19 are on trial in Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea. </p> <p>Prosecutors claim the men on the plane were mercenaries led by Briton Simon Mann, 51. Mr Mann is the founder of Executive Outcomes, a mercenary company, and a neighbour of Sir Mark in South Africa. He was arrested on the plane in Harare and is currently in a prison in Zimbabwe while his trial continues. </p> <p>The Equatorial Guinea government has accused the millionaire oil trader, Ely Calil, of having helped to organise a coup from his west London home, and has issued a warrant for the arrest of David Hart, a former adviser to Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo.</p> <p>The exact role of the British authorities in the affair was today unclear, with the Metropolitan police refusing to comment on what representations it had received from Equatorial Guinea and South Africa, or what extradition procedures it was involved in. </p> <p>A spokesman for New Scotland Yard would only confirm that it was in discussions with the Home Office about how to proceed, having received a letter from a firm of solicitors. The spokesman would not comment on who the solicitors were acting for.</p> <p>Asked about the discussions with the police, a Home Office spokeswoman told Guardian Unlimited that \"the UK would always stand ready to assist other countries with matters of judicial cooperation or mutual legal assistance\".</p> <p>Sir Mark's lawyer, Peter Hodes, yesterday said that his client had been arrested on suspicion of providing finance for a helicopter linked to the alleged plot. \"He will plead not guilty,\" Mr Hodes said. </p> <p>In a statement released by his spokesman, Lord Bell, yesterday, Sir Mark said: \"I am innocent of all charges made against me. I have been and am co-operating fully with the authorities in order to resolve the matter. </p> <p>\"I have no involvement in an alleged coup in Equatorial Guinea, and I reject all suggestions to the contrary.\" </p> <p>Lord Bell said Sir Mark was due to return to court in mid-November. A magistrates court in Cape Town yesterday set his bail at two million rand (\u00a3175,000). He was placed under house arrest, and has until September 8 to post his bail. </p> <p>Sir Mark, who inherited the baronetcy of his late father, Sir Denis, last year, could face a 15-year prison sentence if convicted, according to a police source. </p> <p>The alleged plotters were said to be hoping to exploit Equatorial Guinea's huge oil reserves by installing their own leader, Severo Moto, who is currently in exile in Spain. </p> <p>Others implicated in the alleged plot include South African arms dealer Nick du Toit, who faces the death penalty if convicted. His co-defendants face prison sentences of up to 86 years if the case is found proved against them. </p> <p>The 19 people on trial in Equatorial Guinea are charged with attempting to assassinate a head of state, illegal possession of arms and explosives, terrorism, treason and endangering the public. Verdicts in their cases are expected on Saturday. </p> <p>Equatorial Guinea pumps 350,000 barrels of oil a day, and has become Africa's third-largest oil producer since offshore development began in the mid-90s. </p> <p>Baroness Thatcher has declined to comment on the situation.</p>",

Being married to a half Welsh person, I have to remind my children that they are a quarter Welsh, and that if they fall below the standards that I expect from them, then at least they could play sport for Wales - in later years I'm hoping that their response would be that at least they won't have to represent Scotland.\"</p> <p><strong>1639</strong> The men's modern pentathlon has been won by the Russian Andrei Moiseev.</p> <p>\"Perhaps Alan Sprang should reconsider the relative strengths of Welsh and Scottish sport this century - i.e. the past four years,\" writes Jack Whibley. \"A resurgent Welsh football and rugby team have been 'matched' by a dearth of talent from North of the border.\"</p> <p><strong>1632</strong> Lithuania are through to the men's basketball semi-finals after a 95-75 win over China.</p> <p>\"If you win a relay, you're a relay gold-medallist,\" explains Niall McDonagh. \"If you win the 100m or 200m (or 400m ?), you are a sprint gold medallist.

His main rival, number 11 (not sure of his name as me and my girlfriend call him Pudsey after the Children in Need mascot), wears a more understated headband which he constantly arranges to make sure its jaunty angle is maintained.

I know people who can drink two pints in about 10 seconds.\"</p> <p><strong>1443</strong> Bad news - at last - for Matthew Pinsent, who has lost his place on the International Olympic Committee. I don't think this means an awful lot in practice, but it will doubtless be described as a major blow to London's already pitiful hopes of staging the 2012 games.</p> <p>\"There's something peculiarly amusing about the Tae Kwon-do as they bounce incessantly up and down, only pausing to occasionally pull up their trousers,\" notes Patrick Samphire. \"It's not exactly the Karate Kid, is it?\"</p> <p> <strong>1440</strong> \"Standing on a pillow?\" alaughs Rob Mansfield. \"Well, It's obvious, isn't it?

More of which later.</p> <p>Here, meanwhile, is the answer to Mostyn's teaser: \"Little-known Americans who (in addition to Justin Gatlin, Maurice Greene, Shawn Crawford, John Capel, Coby Miller, Bernard Williams and Tim Montgomery) have run faster than any British athlete over 100m in 2004. That's 14 Americans before the first Brit and it's a similar story over 200m. As Michael Johnson said, British athletes think they are stars when in reality they are mediocre at best. And please don't start me off on Darren Campbell's hamstring \"injury\". Pathetic.\"</p> <p><strong>1433</strong> \"A little question for you,\" writes Mostyn Lewis. \"Who are Leonard Scott, Mickey Grimes, Tyson Gay, Marcus Brunson, Mardy Scales, Joshua Johnson and Tyree Gailes?\" I'll provide the answer in the next bulletin.

And I still think that organising a sporting event in conditions which results in competitors needing to go on a drip is grossly irresponsible.\" Amen.</p> <p><strong>1427</strong> After that thrilling defeat for Spain by USA in the quarter-finals of the men's basketball, Paul Lofthouse offers another perspective. \"I was listening to Spanish radio commentary on the game and I can tell you they were disgusted by the refereeing. Virtually not a single personal foul has been awarded to the Europeans. Lots of talk of conspiracies, Mexican referees etc.\"</p> <p><strong>1426</strong> Green is out of the tae kwon-do.

Mr Booth will be back to keep you abreast of developments shortly.</p> <p><strong>2.10pm</strong> It's virtually all over by the looks of things... one minute left and they're nine points off the pace - and getting scrappy now, too. 95-86.</p> <p>\"Paula Radcliffe should turn up in civvies and hang around the stadium pretending not to be bothered, give an interview saying she isn't going to run followed by a nonchalant stroll to the start ostensibly to wish the others luck and then just before the start reveal that she's got her running clobber on underneath and join in,\" says Andrew Goldsby. \"Works in American Wrestling every time.\" </p> <p><strong>2.05pm</strong> Two minutes to go, and Spain are only five behind now, with 86 to America's 91. </p> <p>\"During the swimming Sharron Davies said that Ian Thorpe was twice as big a global star as David Beckham, was this just typical commentator's hyperbole trying to over hype their own sport, or is their a grain of truth in this?\" You even have to ask, Harry Dolby?

Spain are still looking good though, and as I like to tell myself on the treadmill, eight minutes is a long long time.</p> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> Things are hotting up again, the Spaniards on 67, USA 74 as we head into the third break. I'm hoping Eurosport will spice up the break by sending Gunnell into the arena to ask how everyone's feeling before smiling inanely for the next five minutes.</p> <p>David Slovak wants to know what Paula Radcliffe's doing about the 10k, but the honest answer is we don't know more than you, and we probably won't until tomorrow - her names in the hat, but she won't decide until the last moment.</p>",
  "A heady cocktail of interlinked bribes is the succulent carrot unveiled by the concerned Singapore government to encourage its usually very compliant citizens to shelve the single or dinks - double-income-no-kids - lifestyle for parenthood. <p>Tax relief for parents, family allowance for the first and fourth children in addition to the second and third, cheaper mortgages for large families, lower maid fees and longer maternity leave and holiday entitlement for mothers are just some of the measures ministers hope will mean busier maternity wards from next May. </p> <p>Announcing the plan yesterday, the head of the committee that has been studying the issue for months, Lim Hng Kiang, tried to disguise the initiative as a scheme to promote family living. </p> <p>\"Ultimately, it is about making Singapore a great place for families,\" he said. But he then spoilt his spin by admitting the real reason for the benevolence. </p> <p>\"Our declining birth rate is an issue of long-term national significance,\" he said. \"Efforts to promote parenthood therefore warrant a substantial investment by the government.\" </p> <p>The urgency, demonstrated by the absence of any stick in sight - a rarity in the tightly-controlled city-state - is driven by a fear that the population is shrinking out of control. In 2001 it was 3.1million but the birth rate has been falling dramatically for years. Last year it was a measly 1.26 children per couple, well below the 2.1 required to sustain a population and a fraction of the 5.8 in Singapore's heady days of post-independence in the mid-1960s. </p> <p>Another sign of just how desperate the times are is the fact that a previously non-negotiable position - age and education criteria for benefits - has been completely shelved. All parents, regardless of their age and education level, will be entitled to all the incentives. </p> <p>Mr Lim estimates the measures will cost the government S$300m (\u00a396m) a year, on top of the S$500m worth of measures introduced recently that were deemed inadequate to entice the seriously consumer-driven Singaporeans to start building families. </p> <p>The short-term goal is a birth rate of 1.5 children per couple, with an optimistic 1.8 within five years. Singapore finds itself in this quandary because of the triumph of its birth control plans in the 1970s and '80s. The disincentives to have many children were varied and just too successful. </p> <p>What surprised analysts was the fact that the government, which is masterful at micro-managing most aspects of people's lives, from spitting and jay-walking to education and dating, did not spot the trend and start reversing policies earlier. </p> <p>The question now is whether a populace so conditioned to doing what it's told and virtually brainwashed into believing in the importance of a decent education, good career and large salary, will be able to undergo a mindset revolution. </p> <p>Social engineering advocates say yes, simply because Singaporeans are so malleable thanks to living in a society where George Orwell's Big Brother could have learnt a thing or two about mind control. </p> <p>And the brainwashing has already begun. In his National Day speech on Sunday, the new prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong hid his iron fist in a very thick velvet glove. \"You can have the most successful career, you can be the richest man on earth or the most powerful man or woman on earth,\" he said. \"But if you don't have a family and don't have children, I think you're missing something.\" </p> <p>The sceptics argue however that the younger generation is not as compliant as its parents', thanks to much greater access to the world outside the goldfish bowl of the island. It will therefore take much more than a few bribes to alter fundamental values, they say. </p> <p>Evidence of this is that professional women questioned during the planning process expressed concern that the extension of maternity leave from eight to 12 weeks would leave them at a serious disadvantage as far as career development is concerned. </p> <p>Only time will tell who is proved right but many governments around the world are likely to be paying keen attention. Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and several European countries are suffering similar population crises and don't seem to have found a solution. </p> <p>It's obvious that Singapore's answers are not necessarily going to work elsewhere but don't be surprised if governments start giving tax relief to people who employ granny and grandpa as babysitters.</p>",

Where monitoring proves any such use of one of its computers, disciplinary action will be taken and may lead to criminal prosecution.</p> <p>\"In the majority of cases, where monitoring has picked up apparent inappropriate use, further investigation showed that staff innocently followed a link from another site and were unaware of its content and that access was not deliberate.\"</p>",

  "<p>Weir Group, the blue chip engineer at the centre of an Iraqi kickback scandal, said yesterday it might never trace \u00a34.2m worth of \"irregular\" payments which may have ended up in the hands of Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>But chief executive Mark Selway insisted his business was unaffected by the problems, which knocked \u00a335m off its share price when they were first confirmed. </p> <p>\"The investigation continues and we have not yet determined where the cash ended up. We may never find out because it's all very murky,\" Mr Selway said. </p> <p>The Guardian reported in May that Weir's name appeared in an investigation in the United States into illegal payments under the oil for food programme. </p> <p>The scheme was set up by the United Nations but some contracts were renegotiated after Saddam was toppled, because the UN deemed \"after-sales service fees\" imposed by Weir and others were in reality kickbacks. </p> <p>Weir initially denied any connection with the controversy but last month the company admitted it had been involved and apologised. </p> <p>The Glasgow-based pumps and valves specialist, which counts former Nato secretary-general Lord Robertson as a board member, blamed a local agent for taking extra money from its Wesco Dubai business. Weir admitted this money might have found its way back to Iraq. </p> <p>Law firm Herbert Smith was brought in to review the case and confirmed 15 contracts had been tainted. </p> <p>Mr Selway said its customers had been very supportive and had appreciated that Weir had owned up \"quickly and honestly\" to these problems. </p> <p>There had been no impact on its financial performance so far and the company did not expect any in future. </p> <p>Mr Selway would not comment on whether any staff members had been disciplined or dismissed for legal reasons. </p> <p>Iraq contracts provided \u00a36.9m worth of company revenues in the first half of the financial year and should provide a similar amount during the next six months. </p> <p>Interim group turnover was down by \u00a32m to \u00a3392.4m, while underlying pre-tax profits came in at \u00a324.6m, up by a mere \u00a31m from 12 months earlier, it reported yesterday. </p> <p>Shares in the company dropped 2% to 273p, with analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston describing the financial results as \"a little disappointing\" and Deutsche Bank urging investors to sell. </p> <p>But Weir was upbeat, pointing to a 25% increase in its total order book, with particular opportunities recently emerging in China. </p> <p>The group said it was benefiting from increased spending by the oil companies as a result of the high world crude prices. </p> <p>Weir is also hopeful that the nuclear industry is taking off again following a contract win for a new reactor in Finland. The company is also building up its expertise in the renewables sector.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Dr Frankenstein</strong><br>Frankenstein was one of the first works of science fiction and with it, the original bad press for scientists. Victor Frankenstein was way ahead of his time in reanimating the dead, a feat unachieved in almost 200 years since the publication of Mary Shelley's 1818 horror novel. But, contravening good scientific practice, Frankenstein submits no details of his methodology. \"I am not recording the vision of a madman,\" he says quite sanely, while sewing together stolen body parts. </p> <p>\"Frankenstein kept his experiments very secret, never subjecting his creation to the rigour of peer-review, the press or even close colleagues\", says Claire Bithell at the Science Media Centre in London, an organisation dedicated to finding scientists to talk to the press. \"Then he abandoned the whole project, and allowed his creation to escape into the wild. Despite his apparent technical brilliance and devotion to reanimation as a field of study, this is not the behaviour of a responsible scientist.\" And just as Watergate permitted the press to suffix \"-gate\" onto any scandal, the eponymous Swiss doctor has given the redtops frankenmice, frankenfish, frankenfoods and frankencrops in reference to anything genetically modified. Shelley has a lot to answer for. </p> <p><strong>Dr Octopus</strong><br>Otto Octavius, Spider-Man's archenemy, is a bit of a polymath. According to the current blockbuster, Spider-Man 2, Doc Ock wires his artificially intelligent biomechanical arms into his spine so he can use them to control nuclear fusion reactions. Fusion and artificial intelligence may be a long way off, but brain-controlled robotic arms are closer than you might think. </p> <p>\"Dr Octopus is like one of my monkeys,\" says Miguel Nicolelis, head of the Centre for Neuroengineering at Duke University. Nicolelis's team has decoded the brain patterns that a monkey uses to control a joystick in a simple computer game. \"We can translate those electrical brainwaves into signals that control a robotic arm, and the monkey can control the game without using the joystick at all.\" </p> <p><strong>Dr Emmet Brown</strong><br>Back to the Future's (1985) Doc Brown scores highly in the crazy scientist stakes, not only by having Einstein hair and wild eyes, but also by building a time machine out of a DeLorean. The physics is a little trickier. Until the 1980s, time travel was deemed logically impossible, this position supported by arguments such as the \"grandfather paradox\" used in Back to the Future or The Terminator. </p> <p>David Deutsch, professor of quantum physics at Oxford University, says logical arguments of this sort don't preclude the physics of time travel. \"These paradoxes are all mistakes - not derived from the laws of physics - including intuitions that flow from everyday life. Modern physics gives us an understanding of processes that are utterly alien to our experience. </p> <p>\"The question is not 'what would you do if you had a time machine?' but 'what would it take to make one?' If you ask that question in the context of quantum theory, the answer comes out that you can time travel into parallel universes.\" This relies on the multiverse theory, which says an infinite number of universes exist, representing every outcome of every decision or event ever made. So time travel would take you into a different version of the universe we occupy. Stephen Hawking weighed in in the 1990s, with his Chronology Protection Agency, which says the universe will conspire to prevent time travel. Recent work may have altered that position, but it's dependent on what quantum theory says about gravity, of which, unfortunately, physicists only have a very sketchy understanding. Of the many time-travelling scientists since HG Wells's The Time Machine (1898), Doc Brown's science is as implausible as the rest. But at least his dog is called Einstein. </p> <p><strong>Seth Brundle</strong><br>Seth Brundle in The Fly (1986) is an otherwordly matter-transportation brainiac who neglects to rid his teleport pod of a pesky insect. Teleportation is now possible, but so far photons are your best bet to make the jump. Anton Zeilinger, of the University of Vienna, explains: \"In teleportation, there are two factors: there's the matter itself, and the information about how the matter is arranged.\" </p> <p>Teleportation relies on a difficult concept called quantum entanglement, an effect so bizarre that even Einstein called it \"spooky\". It allows the teleportation of photons, individual units of light that have no mass. Two photons that are entangled can share information, they have a link, but only when you look at them. It's as if you have two identical twins, one in London and one in Sydney. You ask the one in London \"Who was Luke Skywalker's father?\" and the one in Sydney will answer \"Darth Vader\" instantly. \"To teleport a photon, you need one pair of entangled photons. Entangling the photon to be teleported with one of the pair causes the information to be transferred instantaneously to the other in the pair, and the original photon loses all its information\". Zeilinger, who names the 1958 version of The Fly as his favourite sci-fi film, published teleportation of photons across the Danube in last week's Nature. In effect, the properties of the original photon are destroyed, and reconstructed at a different location. However, Zeilinger warns \"we are as far away from transporting matter as we were before these experiments\". </p> <p><strong>Ash</strong><br>Upon discovering the alien in Ridley Scott's 1979 film, the crew of the Nostromo are designated expendable. Ian Holm's Ash, the science officer revealed to be an android, then manages to give crazy evil automatons a bad name by attempting to kill Sigourney Weaver's Ripley with a porn mag. Igor Aleksander, a neuroscientist at Imperial College London interested in robot consciousness, finds this risible: \"There will be conscious robots before long, but they will be nothing like the evil emotionless things of fiction.\" </p> <p>Isaac Asimov's rules of robotics prevent any robot from harming or endangering a human, even through inaction, but Aleksander says that robots will have consciousness appropriate to machines. \"Evil is a difficult philosophical concept to do with life, competition with other living beings and beliefs in God. A robot has no worries about life, has no need to compete with humans ... It is only becoming apparent what the mechanisms of consciousness in people are and how hard it is to express this in anything like the sort of form that would allow us to build a conscious robot.\" </p> <p><strong>Prof John Frink</strong><br>The Simpsons' resident boffin follows the philosophy of science, pursuing his inventions clear of morals, and more often than not, purpose. This principle has resulted in such creations as the Frog Exaggerator, Mood Pants, 77X42 (a lemon ball so sour that it has to be contained within a magnetic field) and the Sarcasm Detector (\"Oh. That's really useful!\"). But Frink's scientific capabilities are limited by his vision. After shrinking Lisa Simpson using a De-big-ulator, he disregards her plea to return her to normal size on the grounds that it would require a Re-big-ulator, a concept \"so ridiculous it makes me want to laugh out loud\". But it's Lisa who is the real science star of the show, despite her father. Upon inventing a perpetual motion machine, Homer shouts \"Lisa! In this house we OBEY the laws of thermodynamics.\" </p> <p><strong>Dana Scully</strong><br>Agent Scully, FBI agent, medical doctor and rational scientist, contrasts with her X-Files partner, paranoid Fox Mulder. Scully's scientific rigour flies in the face of overwhelming evidence. This is a woman who has been kidnapped by aliens on several occasions, and had a chip planted in her head. She's had her eggs removed and the DNA spliced with alien DNA, she has even died and been resurrected. And yet she still refuses to believe in ET, but clings to her unshakeable Catholic faith. </p> <p>The science in The X-Files gets close sometimes, despite the overwhelming fug of supernatural guff. \"In one episode, Scully performs a Southern blot [a genetics technique that can take days] in an afternoon,\" comments John Chilton, a developmental biologist at King's College London, rather uncharitably adding: \"She doesn't do any controls, and it's with alien DNA.\" </p> <p><strong>Dr Jekyll</strong><br>In Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novel, Henry Jekyll, a fellow of that most august of scientific establishments, the Royal Society, creates a drug to separate what he believes are the two parts of the human soul: good and evil. His tincture renders him smaller, deformed and \"tenfold more wicked\". And somehow, it changes his name to Edward Hyde. Ultimately, Hyde starts appearing without the narcotic assistance, and embarks on a murderous spree, finishing off the good doctor. Personality changes of this order are rare, but not unheard of, and the science is poorly understood. </p> <p>In 1848, 25-year-old Phineas Gage was working on the railway when a spark caused an explosion that shot a 3ft pointed steel rod into his left cheekbone and out through the top of his head. Mark Lythgoe, a neuroscientist at University College London with an interest in radical personality changes, says \"before the accident Gage was a quiet, mild-mannered man, yet after his injuries he became argumentative and aggressive, a real change of mind.\" Lythgoe thinks that the changes \"could be caused by damage to the front lobes, leading to a lack of inhibition. This disinhibition may be similar to patients with Tourette's syndrome.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Adam Rutherford is managing editor of news@nature.com</p>",
  "<p><strong> Life before</strong><br></p> <p>If it boasts \"new features\" or \"latest technology\" or \"upgraded\" on the packaging, then tear me away at your peril. And if it wasn't for the fact that Jane constantly reminds me that we have a mortgage to pay and a child to feed, then I fear much more of our disposable income would be funnelled into my gadget habit.</p> <p>A bad gadget habit is usually fuelled by an above-average interest in music and/or films, and I'm afraid I am guilty on both counts. We have a widescreen TV, a DVD player, CD players in three rooms, radios in two more, and a master hi-fi system. I also have an iPod personal music player and an iPaq pocket PC, both of which require a home computer to operate.</p> <p>This all adds up to two things: between the pair of us, we seem to be keeping the makers of four-gang extension cables in business and, given that we also both work on computers, we spend an awful lot of time looking at screens.</p> <p><strong> The ethical audit</strong><br></p> <p>The auditors: <strong> Hannah Berry</strong>, writer and researcher at Ethical Consumer magazine; <strong> Mike Childs</strong>, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth; <strong> Renee Elliott</strong>, council member of the Soil Association and founder of Planet Organic shops</p> <p>As the auditors step into our sitting room, Mike immediately comments on the size of our television. \"You evidently like electrical goods,\" he says. \"You have a massive new television and a good sprinkling of other electrical items around the house. Since your baby has arrived, I suspect you have been spending a lot more time at home, so your electrical home entertainment suite is now probably very well used.\"</p> <p>\"One of the major concerns about the electronics sector for me,\" says Hannah, \"is the number of companies devoting major resources to lobbying for the free-trade neo-liberal agenda - typified by Gatt, Nafta and the like - and against attempts to make the industry more accountable for its social and environmental impacts. It is an industry characterised by short-term thinking, intentional rapid obsolescence and little regard for worker health and safety, union rights or the environment.\"</p> <p>Hannah adds that many electronics companies contract out labour to sweatshop-style factories. Workers are therefore commonly found to have health problems including cancer, miscarriages and birth defects. She says that a Mexican economist has commented that tripling wages to just $2 an hour for workers in the \"maquiladoras\" (Mexican assembly plants generally owned by non-Mexican corporations exporting to the US) would vastly improve living standards.</p> <p>Jane and I are somewhat stunned at this. Mike then raises the issue of our gadgets' impact on the environment. \"Televisions and computer monitors pose a particular disposal problem because the cathode-ray monitors contain lead oxide and barium, which means they will soon be classified as hazardous waste. The good news is that a new European directive means producers will have to organise free take-back for a range of appliances including televisions, toasters and washing machines. This is important, as some 120,000 tonnes of glass from television cathode-ray tubes alone are scrapped in the UK every year. Some 15m mobile phone handsets are replaced each year, too.\"</p> <p>Compounding the bad news, says Mike, is the fact that our electrical goods are often treated and made with toxic materials. \"Many are treated, for example, with brominated flame-retardants, which are known to build up in the human body and affect the hormone system. Increasingly, electronic waste is being exported to developing countries for sham recycling operations, often where there is little environmental or safety protection.\"</p> <p>Hannah picks up on this too. \"Electronics is the world's largest and fastest-growing manufacturing industry, and 'e-waste' the fastest growing waste stream in the industrialised world. Manufacture itself is highly polluting, with each circuit board producing 10 times its weight in hazardous waste. The 315m computers expected to have become obsolete by the end of this year represent more than 1bn tonnes of lead, 2bn tonnes of plastic and hundreds of thousands of tonnes of other toxic materials. In the UK, around 2m TVs are discarded annually, many ending up in landfill. The lead in their cathode-ray tubes (aside from the other toxic materials such as zinc, cadmium and phosphorus) has acute and chronic effects on plants and wildlife if it leaches into groundwater.\"</p> <p>Jane asks Renee if she has anything to add as she has been quiet up to now. \"This isn't really my area, to be honest, so I asked Dan Morrell, the founder of Future Forests, the 'carbon neutral' advocates, for advice on how to reduce the negative impact of electrical goods. He said the first step was to consider the power they use. Just by turning off our TVs, stereos and DVD players properly, rather than leaving them on standby all the time, we would save between 10% and 60% of the electricity we use. Some even say that if we all did this each night we could shut off about three power stations in the UK. You should also turn off your mobile-phone recharger once the phone is charged rather than leaving it on indefinitely, otherwise 95% of a recharger's electricity consumption will be wasted.\"</p> <p>\"TV energy efficiency has been improving,\" adds Hannah, \"but the rise of digital TV is undermining this because decoders left on constant standby will increase household electricity use by 7% by 2010.\"</p> <p>What do they want us to do, we ask. Give up watching TV?</p> <p>\"Why not?\" says Mike. \"Time spent with eyes glued to the screen of your television or computer is time not spent on more fulfilling activities. Trying to avoid buying electrical goods is also an important step. Where you do need to buy them, buying the most energy-efficient model is not only better for the planet, but in the long run is better for your pocket as well. Why not invest in a wind-up radio, for a start?\"</p> <p>And make sure you recycle any old mobile phones, says Renee. \"Many people don't realise that up to 90% of a mobile phone can be recycled.</p> <p>\"Other things to remember: when buying computers, look for a liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor that is compatible with all standard PCs. A 38cm LCD screen uses much less energy than a standard cathode-ray tube - typically 18 watts as opposed to about 200.\"</p> <p>LCD screens last, on average, three years longer too, adds Hannah. She also points out that we should look out for any \"eco-labels\" if buying products such as TVs as they could indicate better recyclability, fewer bio-accumulative compounds and even a free \"take-back\" scheme by the manufacturers when it reaches the end of its life.</p> <p><strong> Life after</strong><br></p> <p>\"This is going to be a real wrench\" is my first thought when Jane suggests that we follow Mike's advice and try to live without television, CD players, radios and the like. Being the bookworm of the family, Jane is keener than me. She says she relishes the tyranny of the remote controls being omitted from our lives. We decide to give it a one-week trial to begin with.</p> <p>Our experiment starts well. On the first night we eat supper after returning from work, then sit down to a game of Scrabble. Even though we argue for nearly 10 minutes about the legitimacy of the verb \"to hoover\", we notice two positive things about the evening: it seems longer without hours spent in front of the box, and we spend longer talking to each other. And that can't be a bad thing.</p> <p>It does seem odd, though, without background noise from the TV, radio or CD player. I have a real itch, for example, to switch the telly on to watch the news. But we do find ourselves getting round to doing those things that have been backing up for months, such as putting holiday photographs into albums and sorting through paperwork.</p> <p>Television is one thing, but we both find omitting CD players and radio from our lives a little pointless. We can't see the harm of music playing in the house, but we appreciate the auditors' point about the energy our gadgets use up, especially while on standby, so we make a real effort to switch everything off at night. We never quite resolve what to do with things such as the digital TV set-top box, video player and radio in the kitchen, as all of them need to be retuned when power is lost. After a few days we give up, but we do cease completely from leaving the TV and computer on standby.</p> <p>A few weeks after receiving the auditors' advice, we decide it is time to buy a new computer. We have had our old laptop for years and it is beginning to strain. We dismiss the idea of not having a PC at all, as we both need to work at home on occasion. I investigate having it upgraded, but the cost is almost twice that of a new PC, so I vow to find a computer that meets as many of the auditors' criteria as possible - namely, it is future-proof, energy-efficient, made by a firm not involved in unethical practices, and contains few toxic materials.</p> <p>I start by looking into buying a secondhand reconditioned computer, but none of the machines packs enough punch to last more than a couple of years. I write down all my computing needs - word processing, spreadsheets, internet and email, managing my iPod, printing and storing basic digital camera images. I rule out things such as games and running memory-hungry image and video packages. I therefore do not need an all-singing, all-dancing multimedia beast, rather a no-frills machine that includes a good processor, ample storage and plenty of memory. This way it should remain capable of handling most of my needs for the next few years with ease.</p> <p>Hannah says that Ethical Consumer magazine only rates a handful of manufacturers positively across its range of ethical criteria. These include Evesham, Mesh and Viglen, so I restrict myself to these brands. I am particularly keen to find a machine that boasts the TCO '99 standard, which is managed by a Swedish office workers' union and ensures that many heavy metals, brominated flame retardants and PVC are banned from computer parts, particularly monitors.</p> <p>Hannah also lists many other household names to avoid due to their involvement in unethical practices, but in an industry such as computing it seems that no one is perfect and in the end I choose a computer that just meets as many of my demands as possible. This turns out to be an Evesham with a TFT-LCD flat screen and a TCO '99 label, but in all truth there wasn't much in it other than price when compared with other firms.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For more about Leo's experiment, and the chance to post your own views and tips, visit <a href=\"http://www.money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving\">money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Leo's next report, on DIY, will appear in two weeks.</p>",
  "Michael Howard today kicks off the autumn political season with a highly traditional attack on \"political correctness\", something he blames for undermining people's ability to tell right from wrong. <p>As Tony Blair yesterday returned from his holidays in Tuscany, Sardinia, Athens and Barbados, the Conservative leader, who has holidayed in Britain and Italy, will visit Stafford to raise his party standard as the general election approaches. </p> <p>The prime minister will be seeking to focus the political agenda on domestic reform issues where he believes Labour is making progress and where the Tories have little to say that will swing floating voters their way. He will reintroduce the hunting bill and make a big speech on green issues. </p> <p>For the Tories, a disappointing summer has served to underline just how high is the mountain they must still climb to regain power after losing two leaders since 1997. But Mr Howard now looks like following former leaders William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith in moving to consolidate the Tory vote, around 30%. </p> <p>Aides said last night that Mr Howard would say that \"in Britain today political correctness gone mad. And it is driving people crazy\". He would invoke \"common sense, decency and humanity\" as British qualities that were better guides to conduct. </p> <p>In doing so he will reinforce August campaign initiatives by his shadow cabinet team that have seen attacks on the so-called \"compensation culture\", Labour's inheritance and stamp duty taxes, reiteration of his \"prison works\" slogan, and attacks on other beloved Tory targets. Even excess police paperwork has been dismissed as a product of PC. </p> <p>Political correctness is a popular, albeit increasingly dated, target of the mid-market Tory tabloids, led by the Daily Mail, but widely copied throughout the media and often directed against what are said to be clumsy or high-handed rules laid down by local authorities and other public bodies. </p> <p>Citing relatively mild examples where official leaflets had warned that musical chairs encouraged aggressive behaviour among children, and proposals to replace sports day with \"problem solving\", the Tory leader will say that equal treatment before the law is one thing, but failure to distinguish right from wrong in the name of equal rights is wrong. </p> <p>\"Political correctness is a culture that offends our nation's sense of tolerance, our sense of honesty, our sense of balance. Whenever there is a conflict between political correctness and common sense, let me tell you where I stand - firmly on the side of common sense,\" Mr Howard will say. </p> <p>Labour's chairman, Ian Mc Cartney MP, said: \"This is a desperate speech from an increasingly desperate leader - but not even John Prescott could rescue this drowning man. Michael Howard has now fully signed up to the William Hague model of leadership - desperate opportunism, lurches to the right, and tawdry appeals to the core vote.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair believes that Mr Howard, who used to savage him when the future prime minister was his opposition shadow, is an \"attack dog\" who does not think through positions he adopts to win headlines. Mr Howard's poor Commons performance on Iraq in July was one such instance, he believes. </p> <p>Though Labour's lead in most polls points to a third-term win next May or June, the Lib Dems and some smaller parties have been picking up angry ex-Labour voters. Mr Blair will seek to woo them back at Labour's Brighton conference.</p>",
  "Michael Howard's attack on a culture of \"political correctness gone mad\" was dismissed as \"regurgitating urban myths\" today, as the Conservative leader attempted to put clear blue water between his party and the government on social issues. <p>In a speech in Salford, breaking the traditional August political ceasefire, Mr Howard went on the offensive saying that PC nonsense was \"driving people crazy\".</p> <p>And he went on to quote several alleged examples from British schools, such as banning daisy chains in case germs made children ill, banning musical chairs in case they made students aggressive and schools considering cancelling pancake days due to insurance costs.</p> <p>The Tory leader said such measures \"take molly-coddling to the nth degree\".</p> <p>But today a spokeswoman for the National Union of Teachers rejected the criticism as \"either inaccurate, exaggerated or simply urban myths\".</p> <p>She said: \"Michael Howard is simply regurgitating the Daily Mail cuttings. Teachers are not daft - they care deeply about the welfare and progress of children, and these so-called PC measures either didn't happen, or have been exaggerated.</p> <p>\"Instead of blaming a PC compensation culture for the rising insurance costs of school trips, he should look at the ambulance-chasing solicitors whose ads fuel the problem.</p> <p>The NUT also said it had never heard of claims that making daisy chains had been banned \"in case [the children] picked up germs\".</p> <p>Another example cited by Mr Howard, in a speech which quoted many unsourced incidents of \"political correctness\" in schools and the police service, was that teachers had been banned from applying sun block to young children before playtime.</p> <p>Mr Howard told his audience: \"I understand some schools do not allow teachers to apply sunblock to young children before playtime with the absurd result that the children have to apply it themselves. By the time they've cleaned up the mess, playtime is over.\"</p> <p>The spokeswoman confirmed there was a basis to this account, but that Mr Howard had got the wrong end of the stick.</p> <p>She said: \"If there are 30 children in a class, and it takes the best part of a minute to apply sunblock, then it makes sense for the children to learn how to apply the sunblock themselves, otherwise it takes 30 minutes for the whole class to be done, and the playtime is over. That's the reality - Michael Howard is talking nonsense.\"</p> <p>Mr Howard's attack follows in the wake of the announcement by the shadow home secretary, David Davis, earlier in the week that the Tories would be forming a commission to review - or even repeal - the Human Rights Act, which incorporated the European convention on human rights into UK law.</p> <p>Mr Davis blamed it for sparking a \"compensation culture\", while earlier this month Mr Howard returned from holiday to announce that the Tories would not implement one of the key recommendations of the McPherson report, calling on the police to make a note of the ethnicity of people stopped by the police in the street.</p> <p>The schools minister, David Miliband, accused Mr Howard of \"opportunism\" and \"extremism\".</p> <p>\"This is a desperate speech from an increasingly desperate leader who hasn't even checked his facts,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Michael Howard has now fully signed up to the William Hague model of leadership - desperate opportunism, lurches to the right and tawdry appeals to the core vote.

  "Bill Clinton is back in Belfast today, the scene of one of his most impressive foreign policy achievements, to cajole Ulster's politicians into resurrecting the Stormont assembly. <p>The former US president's interest and perseverance were credited as key factors in bringing Sinn F\u00e9in into the democratic fold during the 1990s. </p> <p>Mr Clinton was due to meet represtentatives of all the major parties, as well as a preparatory chat with the Northern Ireland minister, Paul Murphy, ahead of next month's intensive negotiations between Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach, Bertie Ahern.</p> <p>After talks with the Democratic Unionist party deputy leader, Peter Robinson, and assembly members Jeffrey Donaldson and Nigel Dodds, a spokesman for the DUP - which rejects the Belfast agreement Mr Clinton helped broker - described the meeting as \"useful\".</p> <p>He said: \"We set out our position - which is that we are willing to do a deal, but it has to be a right and proper deal.\"</p> <p>As he and his wife Senator Hillary Clinton arrived in Belfast for the start of the two-day visit, Mr Clinton said he was encouraged by some of the recent statements by key players in the peace process. </p> <p>He also said a US administration led by the Democratic presidential candidate, Senator John Kerry, would greatly assist the peace process, if needed. </p> <p>\"I am curious and interested [by today's discussions],\" he declared outside the Europa Hotel. \"You know, I try to keep up and I try to be helpful. </p> <p>\"I think it's actually kind of encouraging what has been said lately, and the commitment that Prime Minister Blair and the taoiseach have made in September and what the major parties have said.\"</p> <p>Last night the Clintons dined with Mr Ahern. This morning Senator Clinton told reporters: \"Given the challenges and dangers in the modern world we all inhabit, working towards further resolution of the issues that are tediously stubborn and difficult here in Northern Ireland is essential not only to the progress which can occur here but could be a real example to what can be done elsewhere.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton will also be selling his memoirs, My Life, as part of a book signing tour, while his wife delivers a lecture on peace and reconciliation at the University of Ulster, where she will also receive an honorary degree in law.</p> <p>Senator Clinton will be speaking in honour of the veteran Irish-American politician and former speaker of the US House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill.</p> <p>Today she told a \"Vital Voices\" conference that people in Northern Ireland had to cement the peace process by building up trust and confidence across communities. </p> <p>\"Ultimately it has to be in the minds and hearts of the people,\" she said \"Women play a critical role in doing that.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton made three trips to Belfast during his presidency, memorably receiving almost rock star-like treatment.</p> <p>Northern Ireland's politicians will take part next month in crucial peace process negotiations aimed at reviving the power-sharing executive and assembly, which have been suspended since October 2002.</p> <p>Mr Blair and Mr Ahern will chair the talks at Leeds Castle in Maidstone on September 16.</p> <p>However, with the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party and Sinn F\u00e9in now the two largest parties in Northern Ireland, the task facing all the participants is huge - Mr Paisley refuses to meet with, let alone talk to, his nationalist counterparts.</p> <p>All sides will need to guarantee the stability of the political institutions and the DUP, in particular, will want the IRA to declare an end to all paramilitary and criminal activities if it is to share power with Sinn F\u00e9in.</p> <p>Mr Clinton was proud of his involvement in the early stages of the peace process in securing an IRA ceasefire and also in the final hours leading up to the 1998 Good Friday agreement. </p> <p>At various stages of the process since the agreement, he has telephoned and met unionist and nationalist politicians in the province in a bid to persuade them to remain focused on securing lasting peace and power-sharing. </p> <p>Senator Clinton has also taken a keen interest in encouraging Northern Ireland's politicians to go the extra mile for peace. </p> <p>Her husband received an honorary degree from the University of Ulster during his visit to Northern Ireland in 1995.</p> <p>He returned to the university in May 2001 to inaugurate the WJ Clinton Scholarship to help children from disadvantaged areas get a university education. He made the journey once again in July 2003 to mark the inauguration of Professor John Hume's tenure as the Tip O'Neill chair.</p>",

Ukraine secure the silver after finishing third, while Spain hang on to the gold. That's seven golds, eight silvers and 10 bronzes so far for Great Britain.</p> <p><strong>1223</strong> In the sailing, Britain are fourth, one place behind Ukraine, who know they just have to stay in front of the Brits to secure their silver medal.

Deniss Cerkovskis of Latvia is third with the swimming, riding and running still to come.</p> <p><strong>1214</strong> Here's Richard Frampton. \"During the swimming section of yesterday's women's triathlon, one commentator said, 'There's the yellow hat of Australia out in front'. All 50 competitors were wearing yellow hats.\"</p> <p><strong>1211</strong> In the sailing, Ukraine have rounded the bottom mark in first place, which is bad news for Britain's silver-medal hopes. Draper and Hiscocks lie fourth, with the overall leaders Spain in seventh. As things stand, Britain will have to make do with the bronze.</p> <p><strong>1210</strong> \"Colin Jackson's over-enthusiastic contributions bring to mind that Fast Show character: 'brilliant, fantastic, I was like...amazing!' Or the little David Steele puppet in Spitting Image sqeaking alongside David Owen.

Poor Col. A world record, but no gold cigar. Ouch!\"</p> <p><strong>1207</strong> Meanwhile, the Paula debate has provoked strong feelings, not all of them rational. Here's David Berridge: \"The point about Paula is that she is a professional athlete and none of us are, so how could we challenge her? Can't remember her blubbing and pulling out when she gets paid 250K to run.\"</p> <p><strong>1205</strong> \"Andrea Watts has got a cheek,\" says Rob Mansfield, \"comparing the inane ramblings of bored housewives to the superlative nature of the witty repartee that goes on this site. I mean, knowing that standing on a pillow makes ironing easier is piffle, compared to the knowledge that Israel won its first ever Gold medal yesterday (in the windsurfing), surely? That's World News, that is!\"</p> <p><strong>1204</strong> Amusing news: Irina Korzhanenko, the Russian shot-putter who won gold and then tested positive for the steroid stanozolol, says she will not give her medal back because she claims she had her sample tampered with. The funny thing is, she used exactly the same excuse when she was banned for two years in 1999. \"I'm 100, 200 percent sure that I'm innocent,\" she said. \"I'm the Olympic champion.\" Not the strongest case, is it?</p> <p><strong>1159</strong> Britain are ahead of Spain in the sailing. But they need to beat them by 11 places to pinch the gold.</p> <p>\"In response to Pete,\" writes Christopher Nattress a propos of Paula Radcliffe, \"quite a few people had a recent chance to race her over 26 miles old chap, and the vast majority beat her.\" Technically correct, Chris, but a little to the letter, if you don't mind me saying.</p> <p><strong>1155</strong> Simon Hiscocks and Chris Draper have begun their attempts to steal silver or even gold in the 49er class in the sailing. The British pair are guaranteed a bronze at the very worst, but trail second-placed Ukraine by just two points, and the leaders Spain by a less bridgable 11 points. But you never know.</p> <p><strong>1153</strong> \"Just be grateful you don't have to watch the Olympics through the medium of Danish television,\" moans Ben Jones. \"The long march of countries at the opening cermeony (all in step to the quixotic Greek alphabet) clearly shocked the commentator for DR1. Though the camera panned up to various dignitaries and sporting stars the commentator knew not a jot who any of them were. Sergei Bubka was greeted with a sigh of non-recognition, while Princess Anne was greeted with the words \"there is Margaret of Britain\" (Thatcher or Windsor he did not specify).\" </p> <p> <strong>1151</strong> \"My sister's in Greece at the moment, out there to support Katie Allenby, one of her best friends, who she met at pony club when they were both small,\" says Jonathan Keith. \"Ah! And, you'll be glad to know, Katie's lovely. So make sure you keep us up to date! It's important!\" You've twisted my arm, Jonathan.</p> <p><strong>1147</strong> \"Last night a competitor made a real mess of his pole vault attempt and ended up falling sideways onto the grass,\" chuckles Andrew Doney. \"The commentary went like this: 'That is the worst attempt ever'. I never knew the BBC were employing the comic book store guy from The Simpsons.\"</p> <p><strong>1146</strong> Yulia Pakhalina of Russia has won the women's 3m springboard semi-final.</p> <p>Harry Dolby writes in with another choice piece of duff commentary. \"Last night Dougie 'Stuck-in-a-Rut' Donnelly referred to Iranian weightlifter Hossein Rezazadeh as the 'Strongest Man in the World' at least four of the times he came to lift, and on three of these occasions he enlivened this with the witty aside 'I don't see anyone in the audience arguing with that.'\"</p> <p><strong>1144</strong> Pete Howitt is fuming. \"Will all those people who are quick to put the boot into Paula now be the first to cheer when she breaks the world record again?\" he rants. \"If they think she is such a quitter perhaps one of them would have the courtesy of racing her over 26 miles?\"</p> <p><strong>1142</strong> Things are a little quiet in Athens right now, as you might have guessed. In the meantime, onwards with your emails...</p> <p>Matt Forrest makes a good point. \"A problem for an American Baseball team made up of Major League players taking part in the Olympics would be the fact that they'd be subject to mandatory dope testing, and would almost certainly be thrown out.\"</p> <p><strong>1140</strong> More duff commentary, this time from Tim Morley. \"You had to feel for the poor sprinter whose eyeballs, the BBC commentator informed us, \"you can see, literally, popping out of his head.\" Ugh! Makes poorly Paula's fatigue seem a bit lightweight by comparison...\" </p> <p><strong>1138</strong> \"I cycle past Ben Johnson Way on my journey to work,\" says Aidan McConville, \"but I have a funny feeling it's named after the 17th-century English writer rather than the Canadian drugs-taking cheat.\" I guess so, Aidan.</p> <p><strong>1135</strong> Here's Pauli. \"Best commentary so far has to be Michael Johnson's inspired hatchet job on Britain's preening, whingeing excuse for a male sprint team. 'Some interesting views there from Michael\",'opines Steve Cram nervously, before cutting back to a suddenly Johnson-less studio.\"</p> <p><strong>1133</strong> Our resident tae kwon-do expert Caroline White writes in with a technicality that might come in handy for Green's quarter-final. \"In case of a tie score, a decision is made by superiority which is based on the initiative shown during the contest.\" There you are.</p> <p><strong>1130</strong> OK, we are now being told that Paul Green won 6-5 in the tae kwon-do. he now faces Quoc Huan Nguyen of Vietnam in the last eight. Who cares how he won? He won! </p> <p>Andrea Watts is far from impressed at the quality of email banter on this site, although I'm not convinced her own contribution has done much to raise the standards. \"What's the difference between the questions posed during these discussions, and the inane questions posed by housewives on the pages of such quality titles as Take a Break and Bella et al, my favourite one ever of which was along the lines of \"My husband and I were given a frying pan for our engagement. We are now celebrating our golden wedding anniversay, and are still using the frying pan! Can any of your readers beat that?\" (no, Rita from Darlington, but I could beat you, with said frying pan)? Don't mean to be a party pooper, but come on.\" </p> <p><strong>1125</strong> A few of you are wondering how Paul Green can have beaten the Indonesian \"on points\", as I wrote, after it finished 6-6. Ed Mack has even cited my claim as an example of duff commentary. Well, I was just quoting the official result, Ed. And here's Caroline White. \"I think you're right about the tae kwon-do, but I only know about the semi-contact rules.\" You're just confusing me more, Caroline.</p> <p><strong>1122</strong> A harsh suggestion from Ian Pennington. \"Why don't we have a Paula Radcliffe avenue where the houses stop half way down.\"</p> <p><strong>1121</strong> Just to clarify the situation with the Greek sprinters. The IAAF is launching an investigation, and they will be free to compete until a verdict is reached - probably around the beginning of December.</p> <p><strong>1119</strong> After the shooting section of the men's pentathlon - the first of the five events - Dzmitry Meliakh of Belarus is in the lead, followed by Zhenhua Quin of China. By the looks of things, there isn't a single British competitor in the men's event.</p> <p>Duncan Bennett looks like having the final say on the USA baseball conundrum. \"Even if they let the professionals go the clubs wouldn't release them in the middle of the baseball season,\" he says. \"They do enter but send a team of college kids not-yet-pros... but this year didn't get through the qualifying rounds. They won the softball though.\"</p> <p><strong>1115</strong> \"I clearly don't understand enough about tae kwon do,\" frest Grace Pickering. \"How can it finish 6-6 but Green win on points? More explanation, please.\" You've come to the wrong man, Grace. Something about aggression shown, perhaps? But your guess is as good as mine. </p> <p> <strong>1113</strong> Well, well. The disgraced Greek sprinters, Kostas Kederis and Katerina Thanou, will be allowed to race <em>after</em> the Olympic Games, because they are yet to test positive for a drugs test. You might think that this would be a touch tricky, given that they're never around when the testers appear, but what else can the IAAF - who launched an inquiry into their missed drugs test - do? Still, it all feels very unsatisfactory.</p> <p><strong>1108</strong> \"My favourite over-the-top commentary has to be during the table tennis when the swede Jan Ove Walde was playing someone in the quarters I believe,\" says Richard Hutley. \"Apparently that was 'the iconic moment in these olympic games' and Walde was 'the greatest sportsman of the games' - a tad excessive for a ping pong player even for the BBC.\"</p> <p><strong>1105</strong> \"I like the story about the former British windsurfer Penny Way who had a road named after her by her local council,\" says Colin Gerrard. \"Penny Way!\"</p> <p><strong>1104</strong> \"Didn't our favourite drug-cheating, motorbike-crashing, Greek Kostas Kederis have a street named after him on his home island of Lesbos,\" writes Philip Jeffrey. \"We could have Bradley Wiggins streets, roads and avenues up and down the country.\"</p> <p><strong>1100</strong> Incidentally, the third Briton in the triathlon, Marc Jenkins, finished 45th.</p> <p>\"I used to live near Tessa Sanderson Close and Derek Redmond Drive just off the Wandsworth Rd,\" reports Michael Lee. \"I think they got renamed recently because I don't think they did much for the house prices. Tessa Sanderson Close I can understand but what has Derek Redmond done apart from blub his way to the finish line.\" </p> <p><strong>1059</strong> Amazing! Paul Green has won and is through to the quarter-finals of the tae kwon-do. It finished 6-6, but Green beats the Indonesian on points. Nerve-wracking stuff.</p> <p><strong>1056</strong> The Indonesian has taken the lead in the tae kwon-do: 5-4.</p> <p>\"Going back to baseball,\" writes Richard Fenne, \"did the Americans actually have a team in this Olympics or did they chose not to partake as they have their own World Series and would deem the Olympics as the equivalent of Sunday pub league football?\" The latter, apparently, Richard.</p> <p><strong>1055</strong> Rob Mansfield again a propos duff piece of commentary. \"My fave so far has to be after Amir Khan's second round victory: 'Amir Khan is sending out a message... and it's not a text message!'\" That's a shocker. </p> <p><strong>1053</strong> Well, I might have got it wrong about Paul Green in the tae kwon-do - he seems to be fighting now against an Indonesian. It's four points each in the second round.</p> <p>\"I was amused to note that the chap who won the Super Heavyweight Weightlifting competition yesterday, apparently had a hotel named after winning gold in Sydney,\" writes Rob Mansfield. \"Can readers think of other athletes who have had inanimate objects bestowed with their name after similar success? My other entry is Jason Leonard having a train named after him, following the World Cup win last year. Doesn't beat a hotel, though.\"</p> <p><strong>1051</strong> John Painter has a novel suggestion. And in the absence of very much live sport, I'm going to indulge it. \"I'd like to see the runners in the 800m and 1500m adopt a similar tactic to the cycling and saunter around the track (occasionally goading each other by breaking into jog) before engaging in an all out bundle for the line when they reach the final bend.\"</p> <p><strong>1049</strong> In fact, the tae kwon-do has started - but they're only at the first-round stage, and although I could point out that Tamer Bayoumi of Egypt has beaten Marcel Ferreira Brazil by 10 points to 2, I'm not sure you'd be terribly interested. </p> <p><strong>1048</strong> Peter Dymoke answers David Slovak's call for examples of duff commentary. \"Mike Whittingham claiming this morning that Tim Don could run 10k in under 30 seconds,\" he scoffs. </p> <p><strong>1046</strong> \"Having watched the shot put, pole vault and other field events,\" writes Alistair, \"it is clear that there are job opportunities for decent hairdressers east of the Alps. Are Eastern European atheletes unable to invest in mirrors? Is there a competition for the Olympics' worst hair-do or are there too many competitiors for this title?\"</p> <p><strong>1044</strong> \"Has the Tae Kwon-Do started yet?\" asks Caroline White, whose expert punctuation makes me think she knows a thing or two about the martial art. Well, Caroline, I do know that Paul Green, the world silver medalist, gets going in the 58kg class at 1650. Is that any good to you? </p> <p><strong>1040</strong> \"It was very funny to hear the commentators' fascination with the shoes on the pedals bit,\" says David Slovak after this morning's triathlon. \"Though the transition is as key as every other section of the race. Ask your readers what other duff pieces of commentary there was.\" Consider it asked, David.</p> <p><strong>1037</strong> In the big grudge playoff to determine fifth and sixth in the women's hockey, Australia have beaten New Zealand 3-0. But the Kiwis are still glowing after their 1-2 in this morning's men triathlon. That's three golds in these games now for New Zealand.</p> <p><strong>1031</strong> Later on today, as I'm sure you all know, Britain will be chasing their third gold in the sailing - even if silver or bronze is more likely. Chris Draper and Simon Hiscocks currently lie third in the 49er class, and are dependent on a spectacular choke by the Spaniards, who need to finish 11 places behind them to lose their grip on the gold. Ukraine are in second, just two points ahead of the British pair.</p> <p><strong>1026</strong> Britain's two entrants in the modern pentathlon - he wrote, stalling transparently for time - are Kate Allenby, who won bronze at Sydney and the highly fancied Georgina Harland, who won the European championships last August and claimed gold in last December's World Cup final, also in Athens. </p> <p><strong>1023</strong> \"Good to see you doing some work today, better than the usual hourly updates,\" chides David Berridge. \"Can you tell me what's happening in the Modern Pentathlon?\" Good question, David. I've been trying to find out myself. The shooting and fencing should have taken place by now, with the swimming (1220), riding (1410) and running (1620) still to come. I'll keep you posted as and when.</p> <p><strong>1019</strong> The minor placings in the women's hockey are being resolved as we write. South Korea have beaten Japan 3-1 to win the seventh/eighth-place playoff, while South Africa have beaten Spain 4-3 to claim ninth. Just for the record, you understand.</p> <p><strong>1017</strong> \"Perhaps any shooters left over from the Olympic competition can be strategically placed on buoys to fire mild tranquilizer darts into anyone who adopts illegal practices in the triathlon?\" suggests Daniel Hayes. \"Maybe if it's successful they can be brought into play for the Men's 20k walk, just to spice things up a bit.\"</p> <p> <strong>1015</strong> Drugs update: so far, eight athletes have failed doping tests at these Olympics, while four others have been expelled from the games for crimes such as failing to produce a sample, or failing to appear at a test. I have to say, those figures aren't as high as I thought they might be. Although you never know how many cheats are getting away with it. The Ukrainian rower who has been stripped of her bronze in the women's quadruple sculls was given her banned substance by the team doctor, would you believe! She even declared the medication, which is why she and her team-mates have merely been stripped of their medals, rather than sent home. Not that that is much consolation.</p> <p><strong>1008</strong> \"Is it just me or were the commentators obsessed with the changeover points in the triathlon, as if that was the really difficult bit,\" asks Dominic Jordan. \"'They practise this all the time,' they kept saying. 'Look, the shoes are attached to the bike!' etc. I just wanted to make that point now as it will be four years before I watch another triathlon.\" </p> <p><strong>1003</strong> Andrew Johns is admitting that he had nothing left for the run after a frankly knackering bike race. He's too tired to look disappointed, if that makes sense.</p> <p><strong>1001</strong> Another drugs scandal. The Ukrainian rower Olena Olefirenko has been stripped of her bronze in the quadruple sculls after failing a drugs test. It means that all three of her team-mates also have to hand over their bronzes, while Australia are promoted from fourth. Bet she's popular.</p> <p><strong>0959</strong> Tim Don trails home in around 18th.</p> <p>David Slovak writes in to point out that the skulduggery suffered by Michelle Dillon during the swim in yesterday's women's triathlon is not unusual. \"A friend of mine has been punched in the head before, I have had experiences of competitors pulling on my legs and it is often the norm that triathletes climb on top and all over one another during the swim, particularly in the very first stages.\" That's outrageous, David. Is there nothing that can be done?</p> <p><strong>0956</strong> Andrew Johns finishes in 16th place and he doesn't look very well at all, poor bloke. You can hardly blame him.</p> <p><strong>0954</strong> But he can't! Carter takes gold for New Zealand in an overall time of 1:51.08, with his fellow-Kiwi Bevan Docherty in second, and the Swiss Sven Riederer in third. Australia's Greg Bennett is not far behind.</p> <p><strong>0953</strong> Now Hamish Carter makes a break for gold. Bevan Docherty needs to stay with his compatriot.</p> <p><strong>0951</strong> The two Kiwis are trying to shake off Switzerland's Sven Riederer, and they're succeeding. Can the Aussie Greg Bennett catch him and pinch bronze with less than a kilometre to go?</p> <p><strong>0945</strong> Johns is now in 13th in the triathlon, but he's not exactly motoring - he's two minutes down on the leaders. Tim Don is 16th, a further 20 seconds back.</p> <p><strong>0942</strong> Andrew Johns was looking particularly pale when he ran past the camera in 10th place a few moments ago. Hang on - he's an Aussie, isn't he? Aren't they supposed to be tough. Obviously strange things happen to them when they pull on the GB vest. </p> <p><strong>0940</strong> Alex Marklew has a solution to the baseball conundrum. \"The USA's non-appearance in last night's baseball final probably had something to do with them not qualifying for the Olympics at all,\" he says, with a hint of censure. \"Unlike the basketball, Olympic baseball does not allow professionals to enter, so none of the MLB megastars (most of whom seem to be Cuban or Japanese these days anyway) aren't allowed in.\"</p> <p><strong>0938</strong> Paula Radcliffe has been officially listed to compete in tomorrow night's 10,000 final, but that does not necessarily mean she will take part.</p> <p><strong>0936</strong> There's better news from the canoeing, where Ian Wynne has qualified for Saturday's final of the K1 500m competition after winning his semi. Wynne is also through to tomorrow's K2 1000m final along with fellow-Brit Paul Darby Dowman. Lucy Hardy is also through to her final - the K1 500m.</p> <p><strong>0934</strong> Johns has resurfaced in 10th position! He lives!</p> <p><strong>0933</strong> Well, Johns seems to have disappeared altogether, possibly into the Athenian version of the Bermuda Triangle. That's a great shame. Meanwhile, New Zealand's Bevan Docherty and Hamish Carter are working together at the front, with Sven Riederer of Switzerland tracking them in third.</p> <p><strong>0929</strong> Hmm, this is worrying. There appears to be no sign of Andrew Johns after his superb effort on the bike. Three athletes, including two New Zealanders have made a break at the front of the 10km race, but Johns isn't even in the chasing group of two. Very odd. Is he injured?</p> <p><strong>0926</strong> Michelle Dillon, who finished sixth for Britain in the triathlon yesterday, complained that her fellow competitors tried to scupper her chances in the swimming by shoving her underwater and pulling her zip. And this is supposed to be the Olympics!</p> <p><strong>0923</strong> In the triathlon, the first group of riders have arrived at the transition point, where they ditch their bikes and put on their running shoes. Andrew Johns of Great Britain is among the leading group of six and sets off on an entirely unappetising 10km footrace to sort out the medals. </p> <p><strong>0921</strong> Brazil won the men's beach volleyball, but I suspect there would have been a parliamentary inquest in Rio had they failed to do so. They beat Spain 2-0 in the final. Switzerland took advantage of all the practice they get on their natural coastline to beat Australia to the bronze.</p> <p><strong>0919</strong> Incidentally, the gold medal in the men's baseball was won last night by Cuba, who beat Australia 6-2 in the final. Eh? What about the US of A? Bronze went to Japan, who beat Canada 11-2.</p> <p><strong>0916</strong> The third Briton, Mark Jenkins, was having problems with his bike, and had to wheel it to a help-station, where he was given a shiny new wheel. He's back in the saddle now, but he's got a lot of work to do. Mind you, after yesterday's women's triathlon, when the Austrian/Aussie came from nowhere to win, you never know, eh?</p> <p><strong>0912</strong> Morning. You join us as the cycling leg of the men's triathlon nears its conclusion - just the 10km to come. The good news is that Britain's adopted Aussie Andrew Johns is among the leading group of six riders, with Tim Don back in 13th among the chasing pack.</p>",
  "<p>Jim Speechley, surely the first councillor in the history of local government to continue sitting as an elected councillor after being sentenced to 18 months in prison, is remaining studiously quiet on the challenge of representing his electorate from the confines of a prison cell. </p> <p>The only politically 'non-aligned' member of Lincolnshire council after quitting the Conservative group he once led, Speechley is now on bail pending an appeal, but is not prepared to discuss with SocietyGuardian.co.uk how he will make reparations to his electorate after choosing to hold onto his post while in prison, albeit an open prison.</p> <p>Residents living in Crowland and Whaplode ward, which Speechley has held for the past 29 years, have been without representation since he went to jail in April this year, after being sentenced to 18 months for misconduct in public office.</p> <p>Lincolnshire council was unable to elucidate whether the councillor actually did any work for his constituents from behind bars. </p> <p>\"Even though he has been in jail he has been on the county council,\" said a council spokesman. \"Whether he has been contacted by any constituents, I have no idea. I suppose it would be possible to contact him in writing.\"</p> <p>Crowland and Whaplode residents will no doubt have been delighted to hear that their local elected representative is, for now at least, on the right side of the prison walls, following his release on bail last week ahead of his court appeal in late October.</p> <p>But they face the unique situation of depending on an electronically-tagged politician - under a 12-hour daily curfew - to handle their concerns, in between reporting regularly to his probation officer.</p> <p>Rob Parker, Labour group leader at the council, is sceptical about the level of council-related activity practised by Speechley over the past few months. \"The ward has not been represented for the big reason that he has been banged up for four months,\" he said. \"Now he is out, we do not know whether he is doing any representation or not.\"</p> <p>If the local population feels ill-served, it has only its own council to thank, after the Tory administration effectively decided to leave Speechley in post when he was sentenced for abusing his position in public office. </p> <p>Speechley was found guilty of trying to influence the route of a multi-million pound bypass to ensure it encompassed land he owned, in a bid to improve its value.</p> <p>But unlike other councillors who have paddled up a similar creek, Speechley decided to hold onto political office rather than resign, despite facing the 18-month jail term.</p> <p>The Tory leadership has yet to publicly criticise Speechley over his conviction, much to the ire of the opposition.</p> <p>But bizarrely, Speechley not only dodged censure from his party, but also successfully evaded the very real prospect of automatic expulsion. He remains a sitting councillor, at least until the autumn.</p> <p>Despite the fact that councils can automatically disqualify a councillor following sentencing of more than three months, the Tory council chose instead to wait to see if Speechley lodged an appeal against his conviction, which he duly did within the 28-day period. </p> <p>This initial decision means Speechley can remain on the council until his appeal is heard in late October. Unless his conviction is overturned, or his sentence reduced to less than three months, he will then face disqualification.</p> <p>A high court hearing sought by the council will be held earlier the same month, and will determine whether the council was right to wait until Speechley lodged his appeal before acting to remove him from office.</p> <p>A council spokesman said that the guidance was sought as a means of justifying such a controversial decision to the wider public. </p> <p>Another way of being disbarred is by continued absence from council meetings for a full six months. But the council has also spent its time over the past few months seeking legal guidance on whether Speechley should be disqualified after missing meetings for six months.</p> <p>The council was advised it should extend the usual ruling in light of the appeal, though the extension never required application, since Speechley was granted bail pending his appeal and attended an extraordinary meeting a day inside the six-month time frame.</p> <p>An extra twist in the tale is an outstanding complaint against Speechley made by the council to the local government complaints body, the Standards Board for England, relating to the former Tory leader's treatment of the chief executive, David Bowles. </p> <p>The case was referred to the adjudication panel of England, which could also rule to disqualify the councillor for five years. </p> <p>Fourteen months later, the case has yet to be considered by the adjudicator. It appears that after police investigations began into Speechley's activities, an unnamed party related to the case requested that it be adjourned.</p> <p>So is this a case of a councillor with nine political lives, or too many loopholes in local politics, which already battles against a poor public image? Had Speechley been summarily dismissed following his conviction all these time-consuming pursuits for guidance and adjudication would have been unnecessary.</p> <p>The final irony is that the chief executive of the council, David Bowles, who blew the whistle on Speechley's misconduct, will have left his post before the fate of Speechley's political career is determined.</p> <p>Mr Bowles, a well respected figure amongst council officers and backbenchers, agreed to leave with a \u00a3400,000 pay-off after the Tory council leader Ian Croft made clear his desire for Mr Bowles to go. </p> <p>Efforts to improve the image of local government in the wake of Lincolnshire, will need to be Herculean. \"It is just a bloody mess. Lincolnshire has a capacity to shoot itself in the foot so often,\" said Labour group leader Rob Parker, \"at the same time of dealing with the recent aftermath of David Bowles resigning.\"</p> <p>Jim Speechley and the leading Conservative group refused to be interviewed for this article.</p>",
  "\"Political correctness gone mad.\" <p>It's a phrase almost all of us have used at one time or another. In fact, it's a clich\u00e9.</p> <p>But like all clich\u00e9s, there is more than an element of truth behind it.</p> <p>In Britain today, political correctness has gone mad. And it is driving people crazy.</p> <p>There are so many examples of political correctness, it's hard to know where to start.</p> <p>But here are just a few, to get us going.</p> <p>Staff warned by their local council not to drape England flags from office windows during the last World Cup - in case it offended those supporting other teams.</p> <p>A father of four who chased a gang of vandals with a rolling pin for his own protection because they had just smashed his shop window was bound over to keep the peace and charged with carrying an offensive weapon.</p> <p>A magistrate who, when considering a publican's request for an extra hour's drinking, ruled that St George's Day was not \"a special occasion\" - even though the publican had not encountered any such problem with a similar request for the Chinese Year of the Goat.</p> <p>It would be easy to go on and on, because the examples are countless. </p> <p><b>The effects of political correctness</b></p> <p>In some cases, the exercise of political correctness is relatively harmless. It provides good knocking copy for fulminating commentators, or for late-night radio chat shows. </p> <p>But in many other cases it is not. We cannot simply dismiss every example as an isolated case of stupidity or zeal or plain barminess.</p> <p>The systematic spread of political correctness has a corrosive effect on our society.</p> <p>It makes people believe that there is something odd about what would otherwise be considered normal behaviour. </p> <p>It provides officials with an excuse to meddle and interfere in people's lives, where they have no business to.</p> <p>It leads to expensive, time-consuming and pointless litigation.</p> <p>It plays into the hands of extremists.</p> <p>And it undermines people's respect for the institutions of our country. </p> <p><b>Principles we support</b></p> <p>Of course, political correctness did not emerge from nowhere.</p> <p>Like many of the problems in our society, it arises from the corruption of a noble ideal.</p> <p>In many ways, Britain is a much kinder, gentler and more tolerant nation than it was 50 years ago. We have made great strides in terms of opportunities for everyone in our society, whatever their background.</p> <p>We will always support measures that deal head on with the cancer of discrimination. That is why I have supported and will always support sensible measures to combat race, disability and sex discrimination. And it is why, for example, I support civil partnerships. </p> <p>Over the last 40 years or so, measures like these have made a real difference to millions of men, women and children in Britain.</p> <p>But such measures do not constitute political correctness. They are, in fact, about plain common sense, decency, humanity. These are all the characteristics of a civilised society. </p> <p>Decent people don't want to go around harming or causing gratuitous offence to others.</p> <p>And it is right that the law is there to stop the indecent minority that do.</p> <p>But this kind of intervention is no excuse for the wholesale assault on common sense and individual responsibility that we see today.</p> <p>We have lost any sense of balance and proportion. </p> <p>Consider what is happening in our schools today. </p> <p>In 2000, a government-backed booklet warned nursery teachers that playing \"musical chairs\" encouraged aggressive behaviour. </p> <p>One school banned pupils from making daisy chains in case they picked up germs.</p> <p>I understand some schools do not allow teachers to apply sun block to young children before playtime with the absurd result that the children have to apply it to themselves. By the time they've cleaned up the mess, playtime is over. </p> <p>A Pancake Day race for 40 primary school children in Devon was almost cancelled this year after the school was told it would cost \u00a3280 to insure, and required a detailed risk assessment and 25 marshals.</p> <p>In 2002, the government advised schools to replace traditional sports days with group \"problem-solving\" exercises. In April this year, some Scottish schools were apparently told that football matches with a 5-0 score or above should re-start at zero after half time, to prevent the losing team being humiliated. </p> <p>And one young people's football league tried to censor local press match reports for the same reason. </p> <p>Everyone recognises the need not to put undue pressure on our children. But the examples I have quoted above take molly-coddling to the nth degree. Our children still need to understand, at home and at school, that life is not always fair and that it will, from time to time, deal them hard blows. That is how they learn to deal with them and overcome them. </p> <p>Everyone also recognises the need to protect children from harm. But you will recall the recent case of the primary school teacher accused of Sellotaping over a child's mouth even though the children had regarded it as fun. </p> <p>The case actually reached court where the Judge described it as \"clearly no more than a bit of light-hearted fun in the classroom\". He dismissed the charge, saying the case should never have been brought. He criticised the \"indignity\" of the police arresting the teacher and said that, in forcing a nine-year-old to come to court and give evidence, the prosecution had \"not reflected the girl's interests\".</p> <p>So why was that case brought? Why isn't there much greater realism in such cases, with more caution exercised about bringing them to court when it is clearly not in the public interest to do so? Has there been guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service to stop cases like this reoccurring? And if not, why not? Why have we heard nothing from the director of public prosecutions or the attorney general about this?</p> <p>As well as the threat of pointless prosecution, teachers are also subject, more and more, to frivolous faddism. I gather that the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority now wants teachers to carry out 117 assessments on each five-year-old that they teach. Apparently they want to know whether an individual five-year-old - a five-year-old - and now I quote \"understands that [she or he] can expect others to treat her or his needs, views, cultures and beliefs with respect\".</p> <p>This is meaningless waffle. It is, I suspect, almost impossible to assess. Rather, it is a self-conscious and inappropriate nod to multiculturalism by the QCA which ends up increasing teachers' workload, undermining respect for the organisation, and diverting resources away from the basic need to teach children.</p> <p>This is an example of losing any sense of proportion.</p> <p>There is another example of political correctness gone mad. I refer to the police stopping trouble-makers - as opposed to \"stop and search\". </p> <p>I accept that in the case of \"stop and search\", there should be a record kept by the police. </p> <p>But it is now proposed that the police keep a record of every stop they make - and that anyone stopped by the police should be able to see a record of that paperwork. </p> <p>Now, it takes about seven minutes to do the paperwork for each stop. For half a dozen stops, that's the best part of an hour. Is that really how we want our police officers to be spending their time? Filling in forms when they could be helping to make our streets safe?</p> <p>It's a nonsense. And that's why a Conservative government would not implement that recommendation. </p> <p>This is the sort of thing that leads to distorted priorities, and wasted time, money and effort. Like health experts spending time and money banning sponge cakes baked by the Women's Institute. In our health service, we should all be rather more worried about the MRSA bug than sponge cakes. </p> <p>We urgently need to restore a sense of balance. </p> <p>The balance which will protect children but not to wrap them in cotton wool.</p> <p>The balance that will let teachers teach, and pupils learn. </p> <p>The balance which will protect minorities but ensure that the police can continue to do their job effectively. </p> <p>The balance that will deliver clean hospitals but allow patients to eat sponge cake. </p> <p>The balance which recognises that most people are unlikely to be offended by seeing a national flag being displayed during a football tournament.</p> <p>So why has that sense of balance and of perspective been lost?</p> <p>First, even good legislation can be applied in the wrong way. Legislation that is meant to help can instead be used by government to interfere where it should not. </p> <p>The principle underlying the Children Act 1989 - that the child's welfare is paramount - is universally accepted. And the legislation itself has achieved much. But we need to guard against the possibility of even that legislation being applied in perverse ways, ways which produce an imbalance between the rights of children and the legitimate rights of parents. </p> <p>We need to make sure it doesn't lead to parents being denied vital and important information about their child. Or a child being allowed to make a decision that is not in his or her best interests. Or the state interfering in the family unit in ways which do more harm than good. </p> <p>I have therefore asked Theresa May, as shadow secretary of state for the family, to conduct a wide-ranging consultation on the Children Act, and how it is actually working in practice. </p> <p><b>Centralisation and big government</b></p> <p>Political correctness has also been used as an excuse to increase centralisation and the power and size of Whitehall. The government is currently recruiting new officials at the rate of 511 a week.</p> <p>Political correctness is, in essence, about power. It is someone telling someone else what to do, how to behave, how to speak, how to think. </p> <p>That is why the politically correct brigade needs bureaucrats who churn out paperwork, telling us what to say, what to do, what not to do.</p> <p>More instructions, more regulations, more red tape - too often stopping people from exercising their judgment, from using their common sense and from drawing on their experience. Instead, they are tied up in centrally imposed political correctness and bureaucracy that actually stops them from doing what they want to do, and what the public wants them to do.</p> <p>On day one of a Conservative government, we will freeze civil service recruitment. Fewer bureaucrats will mean fewer regulations. And we will introduce \"sunset clauses\" to ensure that only regulations that are truly necessary will survive.</p> <p><b>Compensation culture</b></p> <p>Political correctness is also expensive. The growing compensation culture is partly the result of political correctness. It is often a misplaced fear of injury and legal action - referred to last week by David Davis as \"the cancer of litigation\" - which leads to a cutting back of playground activities, or daisy chains, or pancake day races. It has even led to the removal of hanging baskets.</p> <p>Even the judges have recognised how the balance has swung the wrong way. Speaking recently, the master of the rolls, Lord Phillips, said that \"people should have a balanced approach and not expect that if they have an accident someone else should automatically carry the can\". As he said: \"... if you take it to its end, you stop children playing rugger, or canoeing, or climbing trees\". He's right. We don't want that kind of society. </p> <p>It's important, in my view, to protect our public servants from the culture of compensation. As Lord Phillips pointed out in his interview, the institutions can help themselves. The NHS, for example, could be more open in how it investigates medical mishaps and, where appropriate, could from the outset make an apology. Very often that's what patients want, rather than money - together with an assurance that it won't happen again. </p> <p>But other measures will be needed to ensure that our public servants are not unduly harmed by litigation, and their career prospects blighted, even when they have done no wrong. </p> <p>Last week Tim Collins set out a series of measures to protect those in education from the damaging effects of this trend, and to give teachers back control of the classroom.</p> <p>Experienced, valued and trusted teachers can too often have their careers and reputations ruined on the word of a single child, all too often acting unthinkingly or maliciously, who chooses to allege abuse. </p> <p>It is time for a comprehensive review of the way in which legal changes, often introduced with the best of motives, have made teaching much more difficult and affected the education of our children in a harmful and detrimental way.</p> <p><b>Fuelling Extremism</b></p> <p>All the consequences of political correctness I have mentioned so far are serious enough. But sometimes they can be still more profound. </p> <p>The great danger of political correctness is that it becomes counter-productive: it can provoke ridicule and backlash, and it can sometimes play into the hands of extremists. Good, decent initiatives are undermined by steps that go to far - and then they are tarred with the same brush.</p> <p>Attacking the St George'sflag means that it can all too easily become the emblem of the far right, thuggish minority, who use it to give themselves the veneer of legitimacy. </p> <p>Meaningless rules and regulations mean that extremists can ridicule all genuine and well-directed efforts to combat discrimination in our society.</p> <p>So political correctness can also mean that we begin to lose the very values which we want to protect - the values of common sense, decency, the distinction between right and wrong.</p> <p>As a society, we have begun to be intolerant of things we should tolerate, and tolerant of things we should not tolerate.</p> <p>We have become illiberal in our desire to curb what was once normal behaviour. </p> <p>And we have become too liberal when it comes to tolerating and excusing behaviour which undermines society itself.</p> <p>All around us we see a lack of respect, discipline and decent values - but we just put up with it. We put up with the rowdy teenagers on the bus. We accept that people are afraid to venture out for a meal or a quiet drink in their town centre on a Friday or Saturday night. </p> <p>We tolerate the intolerable because we are frightened to put our heads above the parapet. And because we do not want to offend the politically correct brigade. </p> <p>The time has come to remember the rights of the law-abiding majority.</p> <p>Sometimes there comes a limit to seeing the other person's point of view.</p> <p>It was the burglar, wounded by Norfolk farmer Tony Martin, who was given leave to use legal aid to sue for compensation.</p> <p>It was convicted mass murderer Dennis Nilsen who was able to argue that his \"right to information and freedom of expression\" entitled him to receive hard-core pornography in prison.</p> <p>Those last two examples were pursued under the Human Rights Act. We announced earlier this week a review of the operation of that act. </p> <p>Decisions are being taken and judgements made in the name of human rights which go far beyond what most people would understand by that term. </p> <p>Of course everyone should be treated fairly and equally before the law. But a culture which fails to distinguish between right and wrong, in the name of equal \"rights\" for all, is a distorted culture.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>Political correctness is a culture that offends our nation's sense of tolerance, our sense of honesty, our sense of balance.</p> <p>Whenever there is a conflict between political correctness and common sense, let me tell you where I stand. I stand firmly on the side of common sense. </p> <p>Common sense, decency, humanity are qualities which the British people have in abundance. These are the qualities we need to cherish. </p> <p>Not all the answers to the problems posed by political correctness lie in the hands of politicians. </p> <p>But there are specific measures that we can and will take to challenge it.</p> <p>Our review of the Human Rights Act will rein in a piece of legislation that is being roundly abused.</p> <p>Our consultation on how the Children Act is working in practice will restore the balance of power between parents and bureaucrats.</p> <p>Our freeze on day one of the recruitment of civil servants will mean that there are fewer bureaucrats to push out regulations.</p> <p>Our proposals for sunset clauses for many regulations will ensure only those that are clearly necessary will survive.</p> <p>Our measures to protect teachers and return to them control of the classroom will make a difference.</p> <p>But of course those specific measures alone can only do so much.</p> <p>What we need is a change of culture.</p> <p>We will say, loudly and clearly, to the people of this country, we are on your side.</p> <p>We will support doctors, teachers, nurses, policemen and the ordinary man and woman on the street.</p> <p>We will say to them, we agree with you. Enough is enough.</p> <p>You should be free to lead your lives as you see fit. We will only intervene when the need to do so is clear and necessary.</p> <p>We will end the culture of regulation, interference and centralisation which is destroying our sense of community.</p> <p>Once again, government will serve the people. It will no longer be its master.</p> <p>That theme will permeate the conduct of the next Conservative government. This is a promise which I make to you today. It is a promise which I will keep. It is a promise on which I shall invite you to hold us to account.</p>",
  "New Labour, new politics - that was the promise. In Blair's own words in his first speech as leader to the Labour party conference: \"It means being open. It means telling it like it is. Let's be honest. Straight. Those most in need of hope deserve the truth.\" <p>Now, almost a decade later, his words sound like self-parody. And yet there remains a certain resonance about them. Truth is the foundation of democracy. Without truth, there can be no trust, and without trust, politics loses its very legitimacy. And that is the tragedy of what has befallen us all in the last three years of this premiership - alongside the personal tragedies of the 64 British service personnel and 13,000 Iraqis who have paid the highest price for what has become the cruellest of deceptions. </p> <p>Faced with this charge of having duped us into war, the prime minister responds with a certain injured innocence: \"Are people questioning my integrity? Are they saying I lied?\" Of course, professional communicators such as the prime minister almost never tell lies. For the most part it's perfectly easy to mislead the public without resorting to that. As Robin Cook wrote in his diary, Blair was \"far too clever\" for that. Rather than allege there was a real link between Saddam and Bin Laden \"he deliberately crafted a suggestive phrase designed to create the impression that British troops were going to Iraq to fight a threat from al-Qaida\". </p> <p>There is more than one way not to tell the truth: half-truths, omissions and deliberate ambiguities can be just as effective as crude lies if the mission is to mislead. All this would still be in the realm of conjecture, of course, if it had not been for the death of David Kelly and Bush's decision to have his own inquiry. Without these unforeseen events we would never have had access to the information revealed through the Butler and Hutton inquiries. </p> <p>But we do. We now know what Blair knew, and when he knew it, and the contrast with his public statements at the time, which are set out in the report, A Case To Answer, by Dan Plesch and Glen Rangwala, published today. It's on the basis of that report that I am prepared to state - unprotected by parliamentary privilege, unfettered by the rules of parliamentary language and without equivocation - that the prime minister did not tell the truth. Instead he exaggerated, distorted, suppressed and manipulated the information for political ends. This was an organised deception to win over a sceptical parliament and public to the military action he had long ago promised his ally Mr Bush. </p> <p>The evidence for Blair's duplicity is overwhelming. He claimed in early 2002 that Iraq had \"stockpiles of major amounts of chemical and biological weapons\" while the assessment of the joint intelligence committee at the time was that Iraq \"may have hidden small quantities of agents and weapons\". He told the TUC in September 2002 that Saddam \"had enough chemical and biological weapons remaining to devastate the entire Gulf region\", while the intelligence assessment was that \"Saddam has not succeeded in seriously threatening his neighbours\". </p> <p>Blair displayed the most despicable cynicism of all when he warned that \"it is a matter of time, unless we act and take a stand before terrorism and weapons of mass destruction come together\", even though the government was later forced to admit to the Butler inquiry that \"the JIC assessed that any collapse of the Iraqi regime would increase the risk of chemical and biological warfare technology or agents finding their way into the hands of terrorists, and that the prime minister was aware of this\". He knew the nightmare scenario he painted would be more, not less, likely if we invaded Iraq, yet he gave the opposite impression to translate anxiety into support for the war. </p> <p>If he was guilty of mismanagement, miscalculation or mere mistakes then the proper place to hold him to account would be the ballot box. Deliberate misrepresentation, however, is what marks this prime minister out. When Peter Mandelson caused \"incorrect information\" to be given to the house, and Beverley Hughes admitted giving a \"misleading impression\", they resigned in accordance with the ministerial code, which states: \"Ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the prime minister\". Unfortunately, the code is silent on what to do with a miscreant prime minister. </p> <p>His refusal to resign in the face of such evidence is unprecedented. There are strong indications, detailed in the report, that he made a secret agreement with President Bush which is illegal under constitutional law. Yet there are to be no further enquiries, no further comment from the prime minister, and no hope of ever seeing the attorney general's full advice. A motion of no confidence would simply divide the house on party lines and fail to focus on the actions of Blair. And, as John Baron MP recently discovered, accusing another member of misleading the house is deemed \"unparliamentary\". </p> <p>Accountability is the lifeblood of democracy. Why should the public bother getting involved in politics if ministers can lead us into war on a false prospectus and not even utter a single word of apology? So what remedy do parliament and people have in these desperate circumstances? Historically, impeachment has been used by parliament against individuals to punish \"high crimes and misdemeanours\". </p> <p>One MP is all it takes to make the accusation of high crimes and misdemeanours against a public official for an impeachment process to begin. Once an MP has presented his or her evidence of misconduct to the Commons in a debate, and if a majority of elected members agree there is a case to answer, a committee of MPs is established to draw up articles of impeachment, which will list each charge individually. The case goes before the Lords. </p> <p>Three centuries ago the Commons called impeachment \"the chief institution for the preservation of the government\". It has been a key weapon in the long struggle of parliament against the abuse of executive power. It has been revived before, after long periods of disuse, when the executive's hold on power-without-responsibility seemed every bit as total as today. </p> <p>Today a number of MPs, including myself, are declaring our intention to bring a Commons' motion of impeachment against the prime minister in relation to the invasion of Iraq. This is the first time in more than 150 years that such a motion has been brought against a minister of the crown, and it is clearly not an undertaking we enter into lightly. We do it with regret, but also with resolve. For our first duty is to the people we represent, who feel they were misled, whose trust was betrayed, who have been placed in harm's way by the irresponsible actions of this prime minister. It is in their name that we impeach him. It is in their name, and with all the authority vested in us, that we implore him now to go. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Adam Price is Plaid Cymru MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:pricea@parliament.uk\">pricea@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p> Shocking news for <strong>Cher</strong>. The singer has reportedly had her theme tune yanked from the upcoming Alfie remake after test audiences had the nerve to laugh when it played over the closing credits. Cher had kindly re-recorded the Hal-David/Burt Bacharach number that she sang on the original 1966 movie for inclusion in the new film, which stars Jude Law. A bittersweet tribute to the movie's hero, it opens with a lilting question, \"What's it all about, Alfie?\" before building to a final suggestion: \"When you walk/Let your heart lead the way/And you'll find love any day/ Alfie, Alfie.\" Now Paramount bosses are reportedly trying to persuade jazz singer Norah Jones to re-record the song in time for the film's release later this year.</p> <p>To bring <strong>The Passion of the Christ</strong> to the masses as part of their God-given mission, Fox studios are earnestly targetting America's churches.

  "<p><strong>Geoff Andrew:</strong> First, I'd like to thank you so much for coming. I've been trying to get you here since 2000, when we did a retrospective of your films, but you've just been so busy, filming all over the place. What I'd like to do is start off by discussing those clips that we've just seen [Central Station and Behind the Sun] because they do relate to Motorcycle Diaries in different ways. The clips I chose from Central Station show you as a director who uses quite a lot of non-professional actors, which you do again in Motorcycle Diaries . And first, you started off in documentary film-making before you went into feature films. What interested you in film-making in the first place, and why documentary?</p> <p><strong>Walter Salles:</strong> First of all, I'm really honoured to be here. When I come to London, I always like to see what's playing at the NFT. I'm very undeserving to be here, but very, very happy nonetheless. I think I turned to documentary film-making very early on as a way to know a little bit more about my country and my roots. My father was a diplomat for part of his life and I jumped from country to country and culture to culture. So when I was very young, I longed for Brazil. I really wanted to know the heart of it much better than I did. That's why I have always admired documentaries, because they open windows that can make you understand much better where you come from, much better than fiction, I think. So this was a really good place to start. I did documentaries for maybe 10 years before I turned to fiction films. But one of these documentaries helped me a lot to understand what fiction was about: I had an opportunity very early on to make a documentary about a sculptor known as GTM - those are his initials - who came from Minas Gerais, which is the heart of the country, and also where my family is from. And he used to carve animals out of wood - he was an extremely intelligent man; he was illiterate but he was much, much brighter than all of us who were there interviewing him. So I asked him, how do you carve an animal which is not native to Brazil, for example, elephants or giraffes? He turned to me as if this was a very unlikely question and said, \"Well, I pick up the wood and whatever is not an elephant, I take out.\" </p> <p>[laughs]</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> I think fiction film-making is a little bit like this - it's deciding what is part of the film and what is not. The necessity to conceptualise has to come very early on, and defining a vector of development for that film also at the beginning of the process will allow you much more freedom as you go along. I don't believe in such a thing as a \"locked\" screenplay. On the contrary, I'm a strong believer in the necessity of imperfection coming into the film. But I also think that the more you reason collectively about what the project should be at the beginning of the process, the more you can improvise later.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Yes, we can talk a bit more about that aspect when we discuss Motorcycle Diaries . But Walter just told me as we were watching the second clip from Central Station, the scene with the big religious festival, that that was actually improvised. So how did you deal with that?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> Well, it was a very well-written screenplay by a couple of young guys who had never done this before but had something more important, I think, than experience - they had the talent and the desire. One of them was a young cinephile who had never written anything before, and the other is a short-story film-maker. So I had this idea for the film but I was shooting Foreign Land and I had written 10 pages on it about what the story should be. And I trusted these two guys who improved the screenplay immensely. But they hadn't been on the ground to actually capture the temperature. So when we were location scouting I saw these religious processions and I really felt that that was so descriptive of what was inherent to that part of Brazil that we needed to plunge it in, so we rewrote the screenplay as we were filming it. I think with road movies, especially, you should leave the door open for things like that to happen. And also, you should be porous to the people that you encounter on the road. You have to be open to let those persons change you and change the fabric of the film. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> This is what I like about talking to Walter - I ask him one question and he answers five. Now, the first of those two clips from Central Station has an extremely shallow focus [a sequence with Dora the letter-writer's customers] - all that's in focus is the faces, and all that's behind them is almost abstract. Whereas once they go on the road, you have much deeper focus. I think that shows the importance you attach to the way the film looks. It strikes me, and I tried to show this with the clip I chose from Behind the Sun, that you're a very visual film-maker. The words are there, but quite often you're telling stories through images, primarily.</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> It's the idea that film and content are tied. With Central Station, the story was basically about the recuperation of one's identity and also, an investigation into the country's identity. In Portuguese, the words for father (pai) and country (pais) are almost the same. So the search for a father in Central Station is also a search for a country. What we aimed to do in this film was to lose the focus at the beginning, just focus on the human drama of the faces in the station, so that as the story gets closer and closer to the father, and by extension, the country, you start to see - through the changing depth of focus - that the reality and the country is actually a lot denser that you first thought. At the same time, the colour also changes - I don't know if you realised, but it's very monochromatic. We opted to use very brown colours at the beginning, and it's as if the characters are unable to see more than that. And the closer they get to the heart of the country, the more colours they start to perceive. So the idea of recuperating one's identity is linked to the idea of having a more wide-ranging sensorial palette as well. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> It strikes me that the film you did before this, Foreign Land, which did get a release at the ICA here but has not been widely seen, unfortunately, is partly about being in exile. It concerns something that happened in 1990 when the president of Brazil froze all assets and that caused a lot of upheaval there. Central Station is partly about the search of identity and it shows poverty and religion around the country. Midnight was about prison conditions, in part. It seems to me that you're very concerned to make films that deal with political issues and social problems, but in a very accessible way.</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> I come from a country and also a continent whose identity is in the making. We're a very young culture, and I think that things are not yet crystallised. So the films that are made in our latitudes, I think, carry that sense of urgency. It's as if the people that you meet on the street and the stories that they bring can influence you directly. Imagine trying to do that in Los Angeles - it's impossible because there's no one in the streets! So little by little, I think my generation became very porous to that. But I think it's not all that different from what the Italian neo-realists did 50 years ago, by taking the camera out of the studio and taking it closer to the faces in the street. And what the Italian realists created was not only an aesthetic revolution but also an ethical revolution which influenced the Nouvelle Vague and Cinema Novo in Brazil. And my generation in Brazil was influenced by Cinema Novo. So we're echoing what's been done way in the past.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> There's certainly an echo when you made Behind the Sun. You went to make the film in what you thought was the driest part of Brazil, and it was a place where [Brazilian director] Nelson Pereira dos Santos had made a film many years ago. But then your film got held up because it rained, and you discovered that it had also rained for Nelson. So was Behind the Sun a tribute to an earlier form of Brazilian cinema?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> It was, and also I was very moved by this novel by Ismail Kadare, an Albanian writer, which had nothing to do with Brazil. And yet the facts he was narrating, which happened in Albania in 1910, also happened in that region of Brazil at the same time. Therefore, I tried to make the adaptation. I'm a little bit critical of the film, watching it from a distance now, because I think I was somehow blocked by the fact that this was about Brazil in 1910 and I wasn't able to be influenced by what was burgeoning around me. The film therefore had to evolve within its own structure as it had been laid out in the screenplay. I didn't go ahead on Motorcycle Diaries before realising that the reality of South America in 2002/03 is very similar to that described by Ernesto Guevara in his book. The structural problems are pretty much the same, of bad distribution of land and wealth. I realised that our own adventure within the continent could somehow mirror what happened to them on a very small scale, and that improvisation was possible.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Actually I don't think you should be too hard on yourself over Behind the Sun - it's an almost exceedingly beautiful film. And it strikes me as your most tightly-controlled film, which makes it certainly very different from Motorcycle Diaries . And in a way, the reason why I chose that clip [of the meeting of the protagonist and a female fire-eater] was to show you trying to achieve something very mythic, with its element of fire and fairy-tale. Was that something that you were trying to do, to create a myth out of reality?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> Watching the clips, I realised that fire was also present in Central Station and I had just never made the link. So I definitely have to ring Freud's neighbour's doorbell and ask what that might mean. I was really interested not only in the mythological but also the almost Greek quality of Ismail Kadare's narrative, the way it touched on very basic elements. I wondered if it was possible to investigate that on film, to work with a scarcity of symbols, but at the same time very strong ones. That departs completely from my experience in documentaries, where you don't crystallise things in advance. And so, the act of filming was not as pleasant as it was, for instance, in Central Station, or as exhilarating as in Motorcycle Diaries. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Motorcycle Diaries feels like your loosest and most relaxed film to date; that's how it feels to the spectator. Was that the experience you had making it, because it seems like you probably had a ball?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> It took us five years to get there. I started in 1999 to do the research for this project. Three years of research and interviews, but we had one privilege - the fact that Alberto Granado, the man who idealised that journey, was now an 83-years-young man, still extraordinarily vital and with an incredible memory. And he made us understand not only the importance of the journey as translated in the journals, but also how decisive that journey had been in shaping the future of these two very young men. What you also have to realise is that in the Latin America of 1952, we knew a lot about the Greeks, Romans and Etruscans but nothing about the Incas. And this is pre-television. So these two young men went on a very courageous odyssey, and the social and political reality that they found started to alter their perception of the world. We wanted to be faithful to the two books that they wrote, but we also wanted to be faithful to the spirit of the journey. And their journey got more and more deconstructed as they went along, so I thought of a film that could also be more and more deconstructed and improvised as we progressed. It's a film made by young Argentinians, Chileans, Peruvians, Mexicans, Brazilians... so it's really a family effort, a collective effort. And a lot of us didn't know very much about our own continent. It's a little bit like the title of that Wim Wenders film, Far Away, So Close. This was how we all felt when we started working on this film, so we conducted a series of seminars in Buenos Aires three months before we started filming, covering the history, music of Latin America in the 50s. We saw documentaries, feature films, a lot of debates were generated. And the whole crew started to come - in the beginning, it was four or five of us while others found the idea especially boring. But little by little, they all started to come, and something amalgamated prior to the shoot. Therefore, the shoot itself was very interesting because we were bonding more and more as we progressed, but physically it was very, very difficult as you can probably see.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Well, yes, because you also had to do a location search as well before starting to make it.</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> I did the journey three times, twice to do the location scouting and the third time to actually shoot. And yet, what we didn't want to do was crystallise what was going to happen, in order to leave the door open for improvisation later on. Especially after the motorcycle breaks down. We understood that they started to be completely transformed, not just by the physical geography, but by the people they started to encounter. And we wanted that to happen in this film also.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> The people you have Gael [Garc\u00eda Bernal] and Rodrigo [de la Serna] talking to in the film, for instance the woman who works in handicrafts, they were actually talking about their lives <strong>now</strong>, weren't they?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> Absolutely. And the little boy in Cuzco, we found him in the streets, or he found us. He came to us and asked if we wanted to know a little bit more about the city and offered himself as a guide. So we said, \"Yes, but can we bring the Super16 camera along?\" And he said, \"Bring whatever you want.\" And there it was. That scene, everything is Take 1. Nothing was repeated. Later that same day, we found those Indian women who don't speak Spanish but only Quechua, who also started to talk to Gael and Rodrigo. And the two of them were so immersed in their characters that they were able to improvise freely within the framework of the screenplay. You have to be careful not to open all the windows and be totally free and unprepared, but you have to try to capture reality as it happens. You see that very much in a refined and yet very simple form in [Abbas] Kiarostami's films, and I'm so impressed by the immediacy and the truth that you find in his films that it just transports you to a completely different level, as if nothing is truly staged. Ken Loach approaches that as well, I think. I'm an admirer of these two directors' work, and somehow I try to find, in what I do, something which may not completely be in the same direction but echoes that.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Did you ever feel that this enormous journey that you were going to have to make for this film might be too much? You seem to like taking on a challenge, and you like road movies, but this was the biggest challenge yet, surely?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> At the beginning I was very unsure that it was even possible to do this adaptation because it was such sacred territory in the whole of Latin America; not only the book itself but the iconic quality of Guevara, which is very intimidating. Which is why it took us three years to do the necessary research before we could move forward. Actually, I didn't generate this project - it was Robert Redford, whose Sundance Institute was very instrumental in the making of Central Station: we received a screenplay prize prior to the film being made, which helped immensely in making the film a reality. And Redford was passionate about this book, and he was the first one to talk to me about it. I said, \"I know it really well, I've read it many, many times, but it's going to be very difficult to put this together because (1) I don't think you can do this in any language other than Spanish, and (2) I think you have to work with actors and non-actors from Latin America. It's such a complex film to make and you'll probably never get funded.\" He had a very hard time funding this film. And the screenplay was refused by virtually all the American studios - I'm not going to list them... alphabetically. [laughs] Actually, the problem was two-fold: first, they asked, \"Where's act 1, act 2 and act 3?\" Of course they weren't there. And secondly, they said, \"There's no conflict.\" But the conflict is internal, not externalised. And if it wasn't for FilmFour here, we would probably never have moved forward. So it was a process that took a very long time, and in between I did Behind the Sun.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Did you ever worry about shooting the scenes in the leper colony? I think you did it in a beautiful way, but did you feel you had problems to be dealt with there?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> Absolutely. First we did a lot of research on that specific disease, which has not been eradicated, contrary to what many people think. There are still 500,000 persons afflicted with leprosy in Latin America, so it is still very much present. Secondly, thanks to Alberto Granado, who is a scientist, we learnt so much about it. Thirdly, through our research we met five former patients of the San Pablo leper colony and they said, \"Well, if you're going to make a film about this, we would like to be in the film,\" and they are. So five of the 90 non-actors that you see in the film are people who have actually spent time in the leper colony. So I didn't want to impose our perception of that, but instead be porous to their input. What I soon realised is that what was happening on the south bank [where the patients are housed] - and isn't this interesting, that even that is emblematic, the north and south side of the river? - was much more interesting in terms of exploring life in all its complexity than what was happening on the north side, with the nuns and the doctors. This is why, for instance, you have the football match in there, and that impromptu music session, just so that you don't look at these people in a miserabilist light. I don't know if you have that word or sensibility in English...</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> It's used mainly of Finnish cinema. </p> <p>[laughs]</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Only a couple more questions before I throw it open. One is, you have this rather wonderful speech that Guevara makes on his birthday about the dream of a united America. I imagine this is something close to you, but I wanted to talk about a united Latin American cinema - because you have been at the forefront of a revival of fortunes in Brazilian film-making, not only by the films you've made but also the films you've produced like City of God. But also you are in frequent communication with people like [Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez] I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and [Alfonso] Cuar\u00f3n in Mexico, among others. Can you just talk about your hopes or your efforts towards creating a stronger and perhaps more fluid sense of Latin American cinema?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> First of all, you may be surprised that I only saw work by Pablo Trapero [director of El Bonaerense] and Lucrecia Martel [director of La Ci\u00e9naga] for the first time outside of Brazil. Their films are wonderful. They are part of the new wave of Argentinian cinema, which I think is possibly the best in the world right now. And these films didn't get to Brazil until very recently - they just weren't distributed because of the control the major studios have over distribution. So I feel a responsibility to help first-time film-makers in Brazil, but also to increase the dialogue between film cultures which are really wonderful and so much closer to us than what we do see on our screens. Also, there are now new laws in Brazil which create incentives for Argentine and Latin American films to be premiered and distributed in Brazil and vice versa. And I hope that this will go way further, because there is much more to unite us than we think. I go and see a film by Lucrecia Martel or I go to see Amores Perros, and they remind me so much of things which are just outside our door in Brazil. I feel that this generation of film-makers is much closer than the previous ones. But also, we live in a freer society. You have to realise that 20 years ago, part of the continent was living under horrible military dictatorships. If cinema has burgeoned, it's also thanks to the fact that democracy - not economic democracy, but at least political democracy - has returned to a great part of the continent. And this allows us to express what we're feeling as film-makers and to try to provide a reflection of that on the screen. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> And as the Argentinians' example shows us, you don't necessarily need a lot of money, you just need imagination. It's amazing what they're doing. Okay, my last question. You have a talent for choosing and casting very good-looking people in your films. In Motorcycle Diaries , you have former regular NFT customer Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, who is Mexican, and Rodrigo de la Serna, who's Argentinian. Can you just talk a little about why you cast these two actors in this film.</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> That also took a long time and the choice of the two actors was made in two different periods of time and in different ways. I met Gael in 2001 when I saw Amores Perros and I was very impressed not only by the viscerality that he had but also his maturity as an actor. Everything was coming from within in a very internalised manner, and that's very rare for an actor of 19 or 20 years of age. I'm not a big fan of \"performance\" in acting. On the contrary, I prefer what comes in layers, not what is spelled out, and I think that Gael has that quality. But he can also do something like the Almod\u00f3var film [Bad Education] - and he's outstanding in it. He does have the capacity to hit you with very light strokes, like gentle rain. I invited him on board before Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n premiered, so he's been involved with this project for a long time. On the other hand, I needed to find an actor that could bring to life the Alberto Granado that I knew by that time, and it was so difficult because Alberto Granado is so generous and flamboyant and wonderful and he's also got a certain freshness. Rodrigo de la Serna, I had never heard of him but he came and did a screen test. He's from the theatre in Argentina, and I was in shock when I saw his interpretation of the scenes I was asking him to read because it was as if the humanity that you had in Italian cinema of the 60s, like what Vittorio Gassman or Alberto Sordi had, reappeared in front of my eyes. I stopped the search immediately and invited him to join us. Having said that, more than 90% of the characters in this film are played by non-actors. The Chilean sisters are students, the people in the leper colony, with the exception of maybe three actors out of about 100 and the former patients, so about 95 people there are actually from the little cities surrounding the place where we filmed. It's a pleasure to blend the actors and the non-actors together, but sometimes it's very difficult to find a common denominator and a harmony. You have to work with actors with the talent and intelligence and the generosity of Gael and Rodrigo to achieve that, because it's not something that comes immediately. You have to actually create something behind the scenes and not work specifically on the scenes themselves in order to generate a backstory between them, so that you can then recreate something later in front of the camera. And again, the less obtrusive the camera is, and the smaller the crew trying to capture that, the better it is. For instance, in Cuzco and Machu Picchu, we were 14, including the actors. That's not a lot, you know. On the other hand, in the San Pablo leper colony, we were 150 - there were about 100 extras in there. But it's not that I arrived there and filmed immediately. No, we played football with them, we had collective jam sessions, we tried to create something of a collective history before we did the scenes - you need the ties, you need that bond before you can actually go and introduce the camera into their midst. You have to respect those people, and not try to steal something. The opposite is true, you have to do it in total synchronicity with them.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> And it shows up beautifully there on screen. Okay, I'm sure people have got questions. </p> <p><strong>Q1:</strong> There's a trend in Hollywood now of remaking Japanese and Hong Kong films. I've heard that you're remaking Dark Water, is that true? How did you get involved?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. I wanted to explore something that I hadn't done before. Also I didn't want to do two road films in a row. Also, I knew that the impact of Motorcycle Diaries was going to be so resonant for all of us who went through the experience of making it that I didn't want to do anything that could reflect it. It's like you need a complete break before you can move forward. So that, on a purely personal standpoint, was how I came to make the decision to make that film. The other thing that attracted me was the study of urban solitude and fear. There's a really interesting French historian called Delumeau, who did a book called History of Fear, about how fear has been used throughout the ages to impose a dominant point of view. I thought that it could be an interesting statement about North American culture at this present moment, but what do I know?</p> <p>[laughs]</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> Also, it was a possibility to work with really very good actors that I admired, including some British actors like Tim Roth and Pete Postlethwaite. But I made sure that I had a return ticket and I intend to use it very soon. I'm completely uninterested in what you may call a career in film-making. I'm much more interested in living specific experiences in films. And a few times it has been necessary for me to go in one direction to better understand what was on the other front. One example: after I did Behind the Sun, which I felt was very contrived, I wanted to do a film where I wouldn't be defining or blocking the actors and instead try to explore the absence, almost, of the director, which is what I tried in Motorcycle Diaries . After a certain moment, what we tried to do was to liberate the actors within the frame and never to rehearse anything but just film it as fresh as it came. The fact that we had prepared and gone through the seminars and already had a back history among ourselves allowed us to do so. So again, Motorcycle Diaries was a reaction against something contrived. I'm really interested in exploring different routes - unfortunately, I can't work in a straight line, I wish I knew how to do that.</p> <p><strong>Q2:</strong> What has the reaction been like in Cuba? What about the possibility of sequels - there's certainly enough material for it.</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> What interested me in this was that really, this was a small story which preceded history with a capital H, preceded what we all have access to through documentaries and images that have already been made. This story of discovery, both of the continent and of their selves, was so attractive because it brought about that specific moment. Jorge Lu\u00eds Borges, the Argentinian writer, said once that every man in every single moment of his life is everything that he has already been and everything that he will be. So this Ernesto that you have in the film is the Ernesto who at the age of five or six could not go into the water because of his asthma and the shortcomings of his social class, but there was already something in him anticipating the man who would implode the limits of that social class, and play a definite role in our continent, of Latin America. But to answer your question, the Guevara family was very close to the project from the very beginning. They opened the doors of the Che Guevara Institute in Havana, we had access to so many photographs which have never been published, and to letters from that period, and that helped a lot to shape what the film is. That continuous support was very, very important. They never asked to read the screenplay, which I thought was really fantastic and gave us an even greater sense of responsibility because it was basically about trust. They saw the film once it was edited. The film was really well received in Cuba on its premiere a few weeks ago, and it's going into wide release there in early October.</p> <p><strong>Q3:</strong> Were you apprehensive about taking on a story about a revolutionary and historical figure, when your other pieces have been, for instance, about a young boy?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> I think there was a common denominator, which is the search for one's identity and for one's place in the world. If I had to summarise it in one sentence, I would say that it's about the choice of which bank of the river we would want to spend all our lives. This is present in a minor form in all my other films as well, but this was so much more important to all of us. This was a film made by a crew where everybody had read the same book, which is so rare. And also, this is a film made by people who were not the same at the end of the journey - we were completely transformed by it. The other films, once we finished them, I kept in contact with many of the actors and the technicians - so, for instance, the little boy in Central Station is going to act in my next film in Brazil. But here, it was so much more amplified. There's not a week where I don't receive maybe 20 emails from Chile, Argentina or Peru, or Mexico and Brazil. This film was so important to us and something of that collective force still remains. So it was much more difficult to do than the others, but it's also, in a way, so much more emotionally rewarding than the films I've done before.</p> <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Brazil is such a big country, so I wonder if maybe people don't really see much of a connection between themselves and what they see on screen in your films. And maybe this is even more difficult for the rest of Latin America?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> At the beginning of the preparation for the film, I was ... I wouldn't say sceptical, but I really wanted to know if that speech at the end of the leper colony episode was one that was close to the reality of Latin America. I was in doubt about whether such a thing as Latin American unity truly could exist, could be thought of or even imagined. But the more we went into the continent, the more we thought, \"Yes, it exists.\" I think the film really is about that. I don't think we can say what the Latin American identity is, but I think we can try to look for it, and look for the reverberations from it. In Brazil, the film has premiered and has been seen by a lot of people, so I think they are also questioning or now carry with them the very same question that I had at the beginning. </p> <p><strong>Q5:</strong> I want to thank you very much for making this film, for showing the humanity of Guevara.</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> That was the most important thing for us, not to look for the iconic image but on the other hand, go in the opposite direction to try to understand the man behind the myth. In that sense, the work of the actors and the screenwriter, Jos\u00e9 Rivera, was so important to enable you to see the character with all the fragilities and not his certitudes, yet. So there could be, in the journey, the understanding of where he wanted to be, that choice of which bank of the river he wanted to stay the whole of his life. So the film was first of all, about choice, really; about the importance of idealism in an age where these words have lost a lot of their significance. Also, every time that we arrived in a different city in our small odyssey, we met people who would come to us and tell us of Guevara's legacy and how it was important to them. And obviously we continually ask ourselves why is Guevara so important today, why is he still so much in synchronicity with this time, and I think one answer to that is that he embodies the necessity of change. And he also makes us understand that it's not utopian to ask for change. And this is very different from what historians like Fukuyama tell us, that we have reached the end of history. Or that we live in an age where all ideologies have crumbled after the fall of the Berlin wall. On the contrary, what Guevara tells us is that you can't live without idealism. This is basically why he still resonates with us. You have somebody who kept his integrity to the end; he was faithful to himself from the beginning to the very last day of his journey.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Sadly, we have come to an end, but I think we have been treated to a film by and an interview with somebody who himself has shown us a great deal of humanity in his movies and has shown that there is a possibility for change. So please put your hands together for Walter Salles.</p>",

  "<p>Rod Eddington, the head of British Airways, and his boardroom colleagues will work alongside terminal employees at Heathrow this weekend as the airline pulls out all the stops to cope with a chronic shortage of ground staff. </p> <p>The national flag carrier is flying in reinforcement staff from airports throughout the UK and Europe to cope with as many as 500,000 passengers over one of the busiest bank holidays of the year. </p> <p>BA cancelled a further 14 flights yesterday including services from Heathrow to Frankfurt, Manchester and Aberdeen. This brought the total number of scrapped services to 95 in an embarrassing self-inflicted crisis brought about this week by a combination of sick leave and delays in training new staff. </p> <p>Writing in the airline's staff newspaper, Mr Eddington will today reject union criticism that he has left BA overstretched by slashing 13,000 jobs. </p> <p>\"It has been suggested that the City has pushed us hard to make cuts,\" Mr Eddington says in his column. \"I don't believe so. The sensible investors have always said the same thing - if you want to invest in BA you must strengthen your balance sheet and ensure unit costs are more competitive.\" </p> <p>Mr Eddington will urge staff to pull together: \"I'm very sorry the week's events have been so upsetting for our customers. We must all work very hard to resolve the challenges they present.\" </p> <p>BA yesterday insisted it was over the worst of the problem, which left 1,500 passengers stranded in London on Monday. It said its flying programme would be under continuous review over the next few days. </p> <p>However, it admitted it may \"merge\" some services over the next few days as it strives to get planes, cabin crew and pilots back into accord. </p> <p>A spokesman said Mr Eddington would be working \"airside\" in departure lounges at Heathrow this weekend. The airline's finance director, John Rishton, and operations director, Mike Street, will be assisting in check-in areas, although no plans exist for BA's newly appointed chairman, Martin Broughton, to help out. </p> <p>Elsewhere, a planned strike by 600 United Airlines staff at Heathrow this weekend has been called off by the Transport &amp; General Workers' Union following an improved pay offer from the carrier. </p> <p>However, a dispute at Eurostar looks set to escalate following the refusal of the cross-channel train company to negotiate a new pay scale. </p> <p>Some 160 of Eurostar's customer service staff are holding a 24-hour strike on Saturday which the company insists will not affect its timetable. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said it was considering a strike ballot among 375 more members at Eurostar, including maintenance engineers. </p> <p>The RMT claims a new pay deal means staff at Ashford station in Kent could earn \u00a38,000 less than their counterparts at London Waterloo.</p>",
  "Languishing in solitary confinement in Zimbabwe's maximum security Chikurubi prison in March, Simon Mann was getting desperate. The Old Etonian and former SAS officer had been arrested at Harare airport two weeks earlier along with a plane load of mercenaries after landing to pick up a consignment of AK-47 rifles, mortar bombs and 75,000 rounds of ammunition. <p>The men on board the Boeing 727-100 had allegedly been on their way to mount a coup in Equatorial Guinea, a small, malarial country in west Africa ruled by a tyrant but newly and filthily rich in offshore oil. </p> <p>Instead of a coup amid untold riches, Mann found himself staring down the barrel of a long prison sentence - or even execution if an extradition request from Equatorial Guinea was successful. So he penned a letter on scraps of paper to his wife and lawyers, demanding that they get people on the outside to exert both their money and influence to get him released. </p> <p>But by writing the letter - a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian - he linked what had at first seemed to be little more than a doomed Boy's Own adventure in a forgotten corner of west Africa to a coterie of rightwing businessmen with links to the highest echelons of the British establishment. </p> <p>Scrawled over two plain pages and a scrap of magazine, Mann's letter referred to a contact called \"Scratcher\" - Mann's nickname for Sir Mark Thatcher, son of the former Tory prime minister and perennially controversial businessman. </p> <p>When the note was intercepted by the South African intelligence services on its way out of the prison, a train of events was set in motion that led yesterday to the raid on Sir Mark's Cape Town home. </p> <p>\"Our situation is not good and it is very URGENT,\" Mann wrote. \"They [the lawyers] get no reply from Smelly and Scratcher [who] asked them to ring back after the Grand Prix race was over! This is not going well.\" </p> <p>But Mann then went on to suggest that Scratcher's involvement amounted to more than using his contacts to lobby for their release. </p> <p>\"It may be that getting us out comes down to a large splodge of wonga! Of course investors did not think this would happen. Did I?\" he wrote. \"Do they think they can be part of something like this with only upside potential - no hardship or risk of this going wrong. Anyone and everyone in this is in it - good times or bad. Now its bad times and everyone has to F-ing well pull their full weight.\" </p> <p>He left what would appear to be the most incriminating detail to last: \"Anyway [another contact] was expecting project funds inwards to Logo [Mann's firm] from Scratcher (200) ... If there is not enough, then present investors must come up with more.\" </p> <p>While the letter certainly suggests Mann was expecting Sir Mark to make a $200,000 (\u00a3111,000) investment, he does not specify whether it was for the coup. </p> <p>The letter also refers to David Hart, the former Old Etonian millionaire adviser to Lady Thatcher during the miners' strike. \"We need heavy influence of the sort that ... Smelly, Scratcher ... David Hart and it needs to be used heavily and now,\" Mann wrote. </p> <p>Even the disgraced Tory peer, Lord Archer, has been dragged into the controversy after $134,000 (\u00a374,000) was deposited into Mann's bank account in the name of JH Archer four days before the coup attempt. Lord Archer categorically denied any involvement in the coup. </p> <p>Ever since the coup plot was alleged at Harare airport on March 7, there have been murmurings about Sir Mark's involvement. He and Mann were close friends who regularly had dinner together, and both owned substantial properties in Constantia, the secluded suburb of Cape Town popular with rich expat Britons. </p> <p>Mann is a complex character, part buccaneering thrill seeker, part businessman, who left the SAS to make a living fighting wars in Africa. It is easy to see how Sir Mark - whose demeanour would suggest he would like to be viewed as something of an adventurer himself - might be attracted to the former SAS officer. </p> <p>\"Nobody is denying they are close friends - and they have been friends for a long time,\" Sir Tim Bell, Lady Thatcher's former PR adviser and now informally advising her son, said yesterday. \"I have not spoken to him at all at any point since this started about six months ago. He has studiously avoided discussing the issue.\" </p> <p>Greg Wales, another man with alleged links to the coup plot and a long-standing friend and former business partner of Mann's, told the Guardian yesterday: \"Simon and Mark did a number of business deals together - in mining, and aircraft and fuel brokerage. The police would have found a lot of stuff on these matters.\" </p> <p>But it remains unclear what - if any - evidence the South Africans have to tie Sir Mark directly to the coup, beyond Mann's letter. There have been rumours that he may have made an investment in Mann's Logo Ltd company through a South African company called Triple A Aviation, which in January signed a contract with Mann's Logo company to provide aircraft and aviation services. </p> <p>According to his lawyer yesterday, Sir Mark was arrested on suspicion of providing financing for a helicopter linked to the coup plot. </p> <p>Banking records show the company, which trades as Air Ambulance Africa from the town of Bethlehem in the Free State, paid $100,000 (\u00a355,000) into Logo's account on March 2, less than a week before the coup attempt was launched. The head of Air Ambulance, Crause Steyl, did not return calls yesterday. His brother Niel, a former pilot for the infamous South African mercenary outfit Executive Outcomes in the 1990s in which Mann was also involved, was the pilot of the ill-fated Boeing that landed at Harare. </p> <p>According to well-placed South African sources, Triple A provided a twin-engined King Air turboprop which flew the exiled Equatorian Guinea opposition leader, Severo Moto, from Spain to Bamako in Mali on the eve of the alleged coup attempt, in preparation for his triumphant return to power. </p> <p>Friends of Sir Mark in South Africa, however, claim that he had entered into a completely separate contract with Triple A to provide an air ambulance helicopter for work in Equatorial Guinea. \"I don't think he knew what he was getting into,\" one told the Guardian. </p> <p>The genesis of the alleged coup plot, according to Mann's own witness statement, began in January 2003 when he was introduced to Eli Calil, a Chelsea-based businessman, in London - a friend and financier of Mr Moto, leader of the Party for Progress of Equatorial Guinea and president of the Guinean government in exile in Madrid. </p> <p>Mr Calil has denied any knowledge or involvement in the coup and his lawyers have suggested that the written and verbal confessions of Mann and his alleged co-conspirator South African arms dealer Nick du Toit, currently in trial in Malabo, were extracted through torture. </p> <p>But Mann wrote in his signed statement after his arrest. \"Ely Calil asked me if I would like to meet Severo Moto... I met Severo Moto in Madrid. He is clearly a good and honest man. He had studied for the priesthood ... At this stage they asked me if I could help escort Severo Moto home at a given moment while simultaneously there would an uprising of both military and civilians against Obiang ... I agreed to try and help the cause.\" </p> <p>Preparations for the coup - money, men, logistics and a suitable plane - were soon set in motion by Mann through two companies based in Guernsey, Logo Ltd and Systems Design Limited. Mann himself sold some of his shares and put in $400,000 to cover the cost of a specially converted Boeing 727 which was bought a week before the coup attempt from a firm in Kansas. Guardian inquiries have established that the aircraft had been converted for US military use so that it could take off and land on shorter runways. It also had a pressurised cargo hold which could be accessed during flight. </p> <p>The final stages were completed in February. Using his military and arms dealing contacts, Mr du Toit helped to recruit the mercenaries - apartheid-era soldiers in South Africa - and to introduce Mann to the head of the Zimbabwean Defence Industry in Harare for the weapons. </p> <p>The broad plan, according to Mr du Toit's account, was for the plane to pick up the 64 mercenaries at Wonderboom airport near Pretoria and then fly on to Pietersburg international airport to clear customs for Harare. In Harare the plane would refuel and pick up the arms - 150 hand grenades, 80 60mm mortar bombs, 100 RPG-7 anti-tank projectiles with 10 launchers, 20 light machine guns, 61 AK-47 assault rifles and 75,000 rounds of ammunition. </p> <p>From there the plane should have flown straight to Malabo and landed at 2.30am on Monday March 8, with Mann in Harare keeping in touch with Mr du Toit in Malabo on his satellite phone. Once the mercenaries had landed one team was designated to secure the airport. The rest were to be driven into town with guides and vehicles provided by Mr du Toit. </p> <p>While separate teams set up road blocks to prevent the military leaving their bases and moving into town, another group would capture minister Antonio Javier - Mr du Toit's business partner - who would guide them to the sleeping president. The president and brother Armagol would then be taken to the airport and, \"if not killed in this operation\", would be flown to Spain. </p> <p>Meanwhile Mr Moto would have landed at Malabo airport, 30 minutes after the mercenaries. He would \"call some supporters he claimed to have within the military and ask them to take control of the security situation\". By sunrise the people of Equatorial Guinea would hear on the radio and see on television their new leader. </p> <p>But the plot, if that is what it was, could not have gone more spectacularly wrong - reinforcing rumours of an intended coup circulating in special forces circles in Pretoria and even openly discussed at an academic meeting about oil, with US and Foreign Office officials present, in London.</p>",
  "<p>Media organisations are preparing a formal protest to the Iraqi authorities after dozens of journalists in Najaf, including the entire BBC team, were forced from their hotel at gunpoint and detained by local police.</p> <p>Around 60 journalists from local and foreign news organisations including the Guardian, the Telegraph and the Independent as well as the BBC, were held for almost an hour while police officers delivered what one correspondent described as an \"unexpected press conference at gunpoint\". </p> <p>\"A number of BBC staff were detained last night for approximately 40 minutes.

  "<p><strong>1 Isaac Asimov</strong><br>As predictable as the human race eventually being enslaved by robots, Asimov, the founding father of modern science fiction, tops the poll. Despite an astonishingly prolific career, he has never been regarded highly for his prose. \"Asimov was not a stylish writer in the way that say, Philip K Dick was, but he was very rigorous scientifically, and thoughtful about how he projects scientific ideas into the future,\" says Philip Ball, a writer of popular science books. Two works mark him out as the master of the genre: I, Robot, and the Foundation trilogy. Last month, Will Smith got jiggy in I, Robot, a film version so distant from the source that the credits say only \"suggested by Isaac Asimov's book\". In the Foundation series, science and maths were used to predict and plan the development of societies, a device that Mark Brake, professor of science communication at the University of Glamorgan, thinks may be a touch heavy-handed: \"We can't even predict a flood in Boscastle, let alone how a society behaves a thousand years in the future.\" </p> <p>Trained as a chemist, Asimov, who was born in 1920, held a teaching post at Boston University for many years. As well as his fiction, he wrote many popular guides to science. His scientific credentials were recognised when he had an asteroid (5020) named after him - as is Honda's humanoid prototype robot ASIMO. He died in 1992. </p> <p>\"Unlike a lot of sci-fi writers, Asimov knew how to explain the science, and was a great populariser of real science,\" says Brake. \"But what sets him aside is that he was also masterful at documenting human responses to scientific progress.\" </p> <p><strong>2 John Wyndham</strong><br>Born John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris in Knowle, Warwickshire in 1903, he was one of the few science fiction authors to become hugely popular with people who never normally read science fiction. The Day of The Triffids, written in 1951, has been stunningly popular as a novel, radio serial and a rather terrible film. In the book, a comet effectively blinds most of the planet, which gives a set of seemingly innocent perambulating plants, the triffids, their chance to bid for world domination. Like The Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, the book now seems to be a Cold War paranoia novel. At the time, it just seemed wonderfully gripping. Wyndham followed up with a handful of other thriller-chillers: The Chrysalids, The Midwich Cuckoos, The Kraken Wakes. All were bestsellers. He died in 1969. </p> <p>\"He was exploring the societal, political and other dimensions as a consequence of something happening in science,\" says Julia Higgins, professor of polymer science at Imperial College, London. \"They were good novels in which there were real people, and the science issues simply pushed the real people into interesting situations.\" </p> <p><strong>3 Fred Hoyle</strong><br>One of Britain's most creative scientists, Hoyle was as well known for his influential work in the postwar years as an astrophysicist as he was as a science fiction author. Based in Cambridge, first as lecturer in mathematics, and from 1958 as professor of astronomy, he also worked in the US. </p> <p>Hoyle's first novel, The Black Cloud (1957), is cited by evolutionary biologist and author Richard Dawkins, as his most influential science fiction work. \"In The Black Cloud I learned about scientific method and information theory - the interchangeability of different kinds of information.\" In the novel, humans try to communicate with an alien intelligence in the form of a cloud of gas, by playing it piano music translated into radio signals. \"Today we see information theory in genetic code and the translation of information from one computer to another,\" says Dawkins. </p> <p>Hoyle wrote and co-authored other books before his death in 2001, including A for Andromeda: A Novel for Tomorrow (1962), Ossian's Ride (1959); and October the First is Too Late (1966). But it is The Black Cloud for which he is chiefly remembered. \"The hero in The Black Cloud is spectacularly unpleasant. He is a male scientist who is arrogant, even fascist. This is very unfortunate and seems to be characteristic in Fred Hoyle's books,\" says Dawkins. </p> <p><strong>4 Philip K Dick</strong><br>\"Magic equals science, and science of the future equals magic,\" said Philip K Dick, whose works are regarded as increasingly prescient. Certainly he is one of the most adapted science fiction novelists: Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? became Blade Runner, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale became Total Recall and Minority Report was filmed by Steven Spielberg in 2002. But his cerebral work was underrated for years until Blade Runner brought acclaim - only months after he had died of a stroke. \"The fact that what Dick is entertaining us about is reality and madness, time and death, sin and salvation, has escaped most critics,\" says Ursula K Le Guin. </p> <p>\"Most of Dick's books are concerned with the question of how do we know what is real. These are the key questions for all of us who study the neural correlates of consciousness,\" says Chris Frith of University College London's Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. </p> <p><strong>5 HG Wells</strong><br>Socialist, journalist, historian, and author, Herbert George Wells was nothing if not prolific before his death in 1946. He predicted the invention of tanks, aerial bombing, nuclear war, gas warfare, lasers and industrial robots. His scientific background (he studied biology under TH Huxley) led him to produce iconic tales such as The Time Machine, The Invisible Man, The War of the Worlds - almost entirely pessimistic about human nature and the future. University College London geneticist Steve Jones admires The Time Machine: \"to my mind the most significant piece of science fiction. The protagonist goes forward thousands of years to find a peaceful society populated by the Eloi, a highly evolved race who sat around chatting and reading the Guardian. Of course, their secret is that they are the crop of a terrible underclass, the Morlocks, who come out at night and eat them.\" </p> <p><strong>6 Ursula K Le Guin</strong><br>Her two most famous works are The Left Hand of Darkness (1969) and The Earthsea Quartet (1968-1990), but this diverse author has produced over 19 novels of science fiction and fantasy, nine volumes of short stories, essays, translations, 13 children's books and poetry. She even collaborated with avant garde composer David Bedford on an opera in 1985 - she wrote the libretto for Rigel 9, about a group of astronauts on a strange planet. The twist is, only one of the astronauts can see an alien city. Her works are vehicles for her evolving views on feminism, environmentalism and utopia and some have been described as \"didactic\". </p> <p>\"It's very meaningful in thinking about gender issues,\" says Diana Liverman, director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University. </p> <p><strong>7 Arthur C Clarke</strong><br>Sixty books, 50m copies in print, and a link with some of the 20th century's most indelible ideas: not bad for a boy from Minehead in Somerset. He was born in 1917, and signalled his space odyssey intentions by joining the British Interplanetary Society before the second world war. He worked on radar in the RAF and in 1945 submitted a technical paper called Extraterrestrial Relays, laying down the principles of satellite communication in geostationary orbits. He graduated with first class honours in physics and mathematics from King's College London in 1948. About 25 years later, the world caught up with him. He worked with Stanley Kubrick on the film of 2001: A Space Odyssey. He was a CBS broadcaster on the Apollo missions with Walter Cronkite, and he is famous for three laws, known as Clarke's Laws and a clutch of unforgettable sci-fi novels and short story collections, such as Childhood's End, Rendezvous with Rama and The Nine Billion Names of God. A polio victim in childhood, and an underwater diver, he has lived in Sri Lanka since 1956.</p> <p><strong>8 Ray Bradbury</strong><br>Has published more than 500 works but is most famous for epics such as The Martian Chronicles (1950) and Something Wicked This Way Comes (1962). His most influential work is Fahrenheit 451 (1953), set in a dystopian future where firemen burn books - Fahrenheit 451 is the ignition temperature of paper. It's a tale which still resonates today. \"I used to read lots of science fiction during my teens,\" says Robert May, biologist and president of the Royal Society, \"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book that was turned into a great movie.\" </p> <p>\"People call me a science fiction writer, but I don't think that's quite true,\" says Bradbury on his website. \"I think that I'm a magician who is capable of making things appear and disappear right in front of you and you don't know how it happened.\" </p> <p><strong>9 Frank Herbert</strong><br>\"While writing the third Dune book,\" Herbert said, \"I first realised consciously that I had to be an entertainer above all, that I was in the entertainment business.\" Nominated for the successful Dune series of novels, which has been translated into dozens of languages, has outsold any science fiction novel yet published and became a 1984 film directed by David Lynch. The novel - an epic tale of a desert planet called Arrakis dominated by giant sandworms, the focus of an intricate power struggle in a byzantine interstellar empire - took him six years of research and writing to complete and was rejected by 23 publishers. \"The best science fiction transports you to a different kind of world,\" says Carl Wunsch, professor of physical oceanography at MIT. </p> <p><strong>10 Stanislaw Lem</strong><br>Lem has sold 27m copies of 2,000 editions in 41 languages, but his books remain curiously hard to find. He is best known for the haunting Solaris (1961) - filmed twice - but aficionados would probably start enthusing about hugely funny, often startling, books such as The Cyberiad, The Futurlogical Congress, The Star Diaries, and The Tales of Pirx the Pilot. He was born in 1921, in what is now Lvov in Ukraine and studied medicine. He published his first novel in 1948, became a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1972. In 1991, the Austrians awarded him the Kafka Prize for Literature. The New York Review of Books called him \"a major writer, and one of the deep spirits of our age\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> More on these and many other authors at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books\">theguardian.com/books</a></p>",
  "<p>As gatekeepers of the world wide web, internet service providers (ISPs) play a vital role in reducing spam in your inbox. But the lack of a real consensus over how to tackle spam has led to a mixture of approaches being adopted. </p> <p>That is set to change as a result of a \"get tough\" policy agreed at a meeting of the umbrella organisation the London Internet Exchange (Linx), which handles 90% of the traffic between ISPs in the UK. </p> <p>Under the new policy, 150 ISPs have agreed to shut down websites run by spammers. These include content sites referred to in spam emails or sites that sell spamming tools, such as CD-Roms containing millions of illegally collected email addresses. </p> <p>Linx regulation officer Malcolm Hutty, said the policy represents part of an ongoing strategy against spammers. \"It won't be the end of spam, obviously, but it will make life more difficult for them.\" </p> <p>But the policy is as much about getting ISPs to face up to the legal issues around closing down spammers' sites. According to Linx, this will encourage ISPs to rewrite contracts with customers to include clauses that will allow them to close down sites if they are seen as supporting spam. </p> <p>\"With a policy like this, it supports the technical teams at an ISP who decide that a site must be shut down. Now it will be harder for management to hold them back because it becomes part of the status quo,\" said Hutty. </p> <p>Linx has had some success with a best current practice policy it released five years ago. The following year it was endorsed by Ripe (Reseaux IP European), an international forum that manages the operation of the internet. As a result of the policy, ISPs tightened up the ways their mail servers could be illegally used by spammers - so called \"open relays\". </p> <p>Linx estimates that only about 1% of spam originates in the UK, and although many spammers are based in the US, they use mail servers in other countries. </p> <p>Linx is pinning its hopes on the new anti-spam task force set up by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), which takes input from governments and meets for a second time on September 9 in Korea. \"We are taking soundings from consumer and industry groups and are looking to export whatever is best practice,\" said Jean-Jacques Sahel, head of international communications policy business relations at the Department of Trade and Industry, which will provide UK input. </p> <p>But many in the security industry remain concerned that spammers are always one step ahead. \"This is encouraging, but unfortunately spammers are like cockroaches and it will only slow them down for so long. They will re-host their sites and find new ways to get their spam out,\" said James Cowper, a senior technology consultant at Mirapoint, a messaging security vendor. </p> <p>\"This won't prove in any way effective unless they can persuade their European and global counterparts to follow suit,\" said Nick Scales, chief executive of managed email service provider Avecho.com. </p> <p>A scheme to make it harder for spammers to forge email addresses is gathering pace. Known as Sender Policy Framework (SPF), it has been endorsed by Microsoft Hotmail, Yahoo, and Google's Gmail. SPF works by ensuring that incoming email is identified against new Domain Name Server databases. In essence, it is as if your ISP is telling other ISPs that if they receive email from you from any other server than its own, it is a fake. </p> <p>Many agree that widespread adoption of SPF could make it easier to identify spam, worms, viruses, and \"phishing\" scams where spammers simulate emails from banks to gather password or credit card data. The beauty for users is that there is no work to do, since the databases are created by ISPs and domains sharing data on acceptable users. </p> <p>In addition, 80 members of the US-based Email Service Providers Coalition recently gathered at Microsoft's campus near Seattle for a summit on Sender ID, an authentication system that combines Microsoft's Caller-ID email technology with SPF. It is being evaluated by the Internet Engineering Task Force as a possible industry standard. </p> <p>Cloudmark, DoubleClick, IronPort Systems, Sendmail, Symantec, Tumbleweed, VeriSign, and Microsoft are all developing products and services that support Sender ID. </p> <p>Yahoo is also testing an authentication system called DomainKeys. This creates an encrypted email address signature, which is then checked by the receiving domain. </p> <p>But Michael Chissick, head of technology law at Field Fisher Waterhouse, says that implementing Sender ID in Europe may not be straightforward. \"It may be that ISPs will need subscribers' permission to use this due to our laws on data protection and human rights. There is also the matter of what ISPs do when they block mail on behalf of subscribers. What if it is mail that you wanted and you can prove you suffered a loss by not receiving it? The ISP may end up being liable.\"</p>",
  "<p>With the average lunch break down to just 23 minutes, work-life balance now means not spilling coffee over the keyboard while we eat our sandwiches and catch up on email. Businesses look to technology to improve productivity and save money; most users prefer the idea of it saving them time. Research In Motion claims its BlackBerry handheld can do all three. </p> <p>According to figures in its latest survey, most BlackBerry users are not just more productive - by up to an extra month's work a year - but they have more free time, too: as much as 13 days a year. </p> <p>Such results may be one reason for the huge growth in BlackBerry sales: RIM shipped more than half a million units in the second quarter of this year. That's up 289% from last year, and accounts for most of this year's 12% growth in the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) market, after two years of falling sales. But with more and more PDAs being bought by businesses, carrying a connected device might look like just another way of taking work home. </p> <p>BlackBerry user Jamie Duc, infrastructure manager for Superdrug, disagrees. He spends some of his commute dealing with emails. That means he knows about problems before he gets to the office, so he can deal with them straight away. </p> <p>Duc also gets to leave the office earlier, especially on days when he has a lot of meetings, because he can stay on top of email during the day or on the train home. Differences in time zones mean he usually gets support requests from overseas staff in the evenings or on Saturday mornings; the BlackBerry gives him the choice of dealing with mail straight away so he does not face an overwhelming inbox on Monday mornings. He might take some work home, but at least he gets to leave on time. </p> <p>The on-call support team at Superdrug is even more grateful for BlackBerrys that run the software they use to manage and even reboot servers across the network. Duc says the team can now fix most problems without getting out of bed. And because team members rarely have to go into the office, there's little travelling time to pay for, which has helped reduce support costs. </p> <p>Superdrug did not adopt the BlackBerry for convenience, though. Duc explains: \"Over the past five years we've looked at everything, trying to reduce remote user dial-up costs.\" The company was also keen to wean area managers away from their laptop screens and get them back into the stores. </p> <p>Introducing BlackBerrys for the area managers has cut dial-up costs by \u00a3800 a month. Says Duc: \"Fifty area managers and no support calls is amazing, because their laptop support costs were huge.\" Just as significant for the business is that the change has made email into a tool managers can depend on. Instead of relying on phone calls and messages sent to individual stores, which are time consuming, head office can distribute urgent information such as product recalls instantly by email. </p> <p>Consumer versions of BlackBerry handhelds mean small businesses can get the advantage of mobile email relatively easily. However, many people need more than email, and enterprises are starting to take the next step: taking line-of-business applications mobile. </p> <p>While the corporate BlackBerry does not have the similarity to the Windows platform that makes developing applications for Windows Mobile smartphones a familiar experience, it supports Java and secure web connections. It is therefore possible to move key applications to the BlackBerry, as long as you bear in mind its strengths and weaknesses. </p> <p>Apart from using it as a phone, there is not much you can do with a connected PDA that you could not do with a laptop with a mobile phone or cellular PC card as a modem, but you have to do it on a much smaller screen. Still, a handheld is smaller, lighter and switches on and off far more quickly, and you do not need a table to rest it on. All this makes it much more convenient when you only have a few minutes to spare, and because it is so small and light, you are more likely to take it with you. </p> <p>One key advantage of the BlackBerry is that email comes to you. The BlackBerry also scores over rivals by compressing email significantly, so that messages download quickly; PC email clients are far less efficient. </p> <p>The battery life of a PDA is far better than any laptop, and the BlackBerry's battery lasts nearly a week. Unlike the numeric keypad on many smartphones, the Qwerty keyboards on devices such as the BlackBerry, Nokia's Communicator and upcoming Windows mobile smartphones such as Motorola's MPX, mean many users can type quickly enough to respond to email. One BlackBerry typist has clocked in at 48 words a minute. </p> <p>Getting the most from technology often needs a shift in attitude, or even a change in the way you do business: going mobile is no exception. Connecting mobile workers with head office more easily and cheaply is not the same as giving workers who are normally in the office more opportunities to get away from their desks. </p> <p>Companies are often suspicious of letting people work from home because managers worry they will not know who is working and who is popping out to the shops. The culture of \"presenteeism\" means people can end up working longer hours, not because they have more work to do but because they do not want to be seen to go home before the boss. </p> <p>Having a connected handheld that lets managers reach workers when they need to could make it easier to trust they will be available when they are supposed to be. Being in contact also means your absence does not hold up the people you work with. Corporate versions of the BlackBerry let you open standard Microsoft Office applications, and if you cannot work with an urgent document directly on the device, at least you know it is there so you can load it up on a PC. </p> <p>Jonathan Wood, senior partner at law firm KSB Law and an enthusiastic BlackBerry user, thinks it is up to us to be disciplined about when we work. \"I rarely look at mine outside office hours, the point being that I really have caught up with my emails so I can switch off. The intrusion of technology is huge, but it is a question of managing your day.\" Or, as RIM's Charmaine Eggberry puts it: \"The most important key on any technology is the Off key.\" </p> <p>Stopping work taking over your life could be as much about self-control as unreasonable expectations.</p>",
  "<p> From the Isle of Wight to Ibiza, from Glastonbury to Leeds, if you've been to a big music event this summer, you will have noticed some new features alongside the camp sites, catering vans and chemical toilets. </p> <p>Also present - and spending a fortune for the privilege - have been the big mobile telephone brands. Nokia was at the Isle of Wight festival, Orange appeared at several of the big summer events around the UK and Virgin Mobile had its own V festival last weekend. </p> <p>All are there for a multitude of reasons - not least because the crowds are exactly the youthful, mobile-addicted generation they want to sign up. But this year, they also have a new motivation, because the mobile phone world does not just want to support the music business, it wants to become a part of it. </p> <p>They already are, in profitable but low-profile ways. According to Ovum, a research consultancy, ringtones brought in up to $3bn in revenues last year. As we get more used to personalising our phones, that figure is likely to grow. Ovum even suggests it could double in just four years. </p> <p>New services will spur that growth. These include personalised ringtones where the caller hears the receiver's choice of music, rather than the traditional ring. It might sound unlikely, but mobile users appear keen to inflict their taste in music on their callers. \"These things were launched two years ago in South Korea and became a huge success,\" says Dario Betti, a senior analyst at Ovum. </p> <p>\"We don't expect the same level of interest as we've seen in Asia, but already T-Mobile, in six months across Europe, has half a million subscribers. It didn't really have too much promotion, but they managed to hit the spot there.\" </p> <p>The mobile business is as keen on ringtones as its customers, because we are willing to pay comparatively large amounts for them. On our PCs, we can download a full track from an online music store for around \u00a31 - often less. Walking down the high street we can buy a physical CD single for \u00a31.99. </p> <p>Yet, on mobiles, customers are willing to pay \u00a32.50 for an often unconvincing ringtone arrangement of a tiny portion of a song, just to project a little bit of personality every time someone calls us. </p> <p>The only people unhappy with this arrangement are the record labels. That's because those screeching tones being sold in their millions were (obviously) not actual recordings - just arrangements of their hits. Ringtone vendors did not need to pay the labels for rights - just royalties to the composers and song publishers. The labels were cut out of the equation, and it cost them millions. </p> <p>Labels are more keen on full song downloads, and for excerpts to be used for ringtones and ringbacks, because they collect royalties. Combine this with mobile phone makers, who make money from us upgrading our handsets, and networks, who want us to download more over their networks, and suddenly there are a lot of people eager to see music downloads start happening. </p> <p>O2 has been an early leader in full track downloads, offering its digital music player since late last year. The device is not a phone, but connects via infrared or cable to a GPRS handset (or a PC) which does the downloading. New handsets from the company now sport similar music capability in a single device. T-Mobile currently only offers music clips via its Ear Phones service, but plans to offer full-length songs next year. </p> <p>Amid the stampede, Orange has managed a distinctive offering that includes music downloads but also adds the innovative Fireplayer application. This lets users of certain new handsets remix ringtones, adding drums, raps, solos and other effects using their keypads. </p> <p>Mark Ashford, the head of entertainment at Orange, points out that this is augmented by large amounts of content available on its Orange World portal, and adds: \"The whole focus of the mobile industry has been the coming together of the phone, the personal digital assistant and a music player. Clearly, they're all starting to come together now.\" </p> <p>But is this really a mass market application? After all, PC music downloads are themselves at an early stage, and mobile innovations typically follow after applications have settled down and become popular on home computers. </p> <p>Orange's Ashford admits it is \"early days\" in terms of digital music, but adds: \"To say this is an experiment is to underestimate what we're doing.\" </p> <p>\"Mobile music has huge potential,\" says Megan Forster, music marketing manager at 02. But, she says, the technology has a little way to go to meet the aspirations of the mobile networks. \"The reason it's not mass market yet is because the handset manufacturers haven't caught up,\" she says. \"We've got quite a complex music download system set up in the background and, to be honest, we're waiting for the handsets to catch up so we can roll out this service.\" </p> <p>Some industry observers reckon it will take years for the mobile music industry to settle down. Ovum's Betti recently warned that enthusiasm for mobile music downloads has been \"misplaced\" because of technical limitations. But he also says it is vitally important for mobile opera tors and handset manufacturers to get into this emerging business, and carve out a place for themselves in the digital music future that may eventually arrive. </p> <p>\"The [current] services are not that appealing unless you're really into your technology,\" he says. \"If you're a technophile and you really want to go and discover them, maybe. But if you're not into gadgets, you will not find them as appealing, as interesting, as convenient.\" </p> <p>Operators need to learn how customers use the services, and they also desperately need to make sure their customers see them as being cool and sophisticated. </p> <p>\"Operators are now fighting for mindshare,\" says Betti. \"Virgin Mobile tries to appeal specifically to young customers, and have been quite successful in getting those users to its network. What players such as O2 are afraid of is that if they're not as successful at being seen as cool as Virgin, they might actually have migration of customers to other players. </p> <p>\"So it's not necessarily the additional things you can do with your phone, but also how people look at you - as a more innovative, more interesting kind of operator.\" </p> <p>This jostling for position is affecting more than just the mobile operators. Some analysts believe the recent assault on Apple - makers of the market leading iPod music player - by streaming media company Real Networks is largely to do with the approaching mobile music battle. </p> <p>Real has ambitions to supply its software to mobile operators and handset manufacturers. But Apple has threatened to get in the way, doing a deal with Motorola that will see its iTunes music software made a standard feature on their phones. Apple insists the new phones will not replace the iPod - the devices will hold dozens, rather than thousands, of songs - but will give mobile phone users \"a small taste of what this digital music revolution is about\", according to Apple chief executive Steve Jobs. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Nokia - the world's largest mobile phone maker - and digital media company Loudeye, which recently acquired UK-based music downloads company OD2, have also announced plans to work together. </p> <p>And Sony - the creator of the original mobile music device, the Walkman - has been busy, too. Its new StreamMan service, announced in June, sends a personalised radio station to users of certain GPRS handsets, in what is claimed to be FM-quality sound. It's only available in Finland for now, although Sony - and its technology partner, EndtoEnd - are in talks with operators around Europe. </p> <p>The key to all this activity, according to Atte Miettinen, EndtoEnd's chief marketing officer, is that operators and music companies are waking up to the fact that mobiles are developing rapidly. </p> <p>\"The market has taken huge steps forward in the past six to 12 months,\" he says. \"One of the most interesting things ... is where the mobile phone is effectively going. Internally, at Nokia, they've stopped using the term 'phone', and now call it a 'terminal' because, from their point of view, we've already evolved away from the phone towards a converged device that combines things such as FM radio, digital camera, MP3 player. </p> <p>\"That, combined with the fact that in the next 12 months we can expect to see Wireless Local Area Network combined into mobile phones, will fundamentally change the way the device is being perceived and used, and it opens up huge opportunities for things like music. The whole industry is buzzing about it.\" </p> <p>Further innovations, including tiny hard drives fitted inside mobile phone-sized devices, only add to that buzz. </p> <p>But we should not get too carried away. As Betti points out, the technology - while improving - is young, and still does not work well enough. For all the hype, there are too many drawbacks - poor storage, battery problems and slow downloads - for mobile downloads to take off just yet. </p> <p>\"It will be three years,\" predicts Betti, \"before we see something that's a bit more competitive.\" </p>",
  "<p>Lethal Weapon star Danny Glover had a real-life law enforcement drama on his hands when he was arrested during a demonstration in Washington DC yesterday. The Hollywood actor had been speaking at a rally outside the Sudanese embassy to protest about the humanitarian crisis in Darfur.</p> <p>\"We must continue to put pressure on the Sudanese government,\" Glover told the crowd before his arrest. \"We must continue to demand justice and we must continue to demand peace for the people of Darfur.\" The latest United Nations figures put the Darfur death toll at 50,000, with over a million people left homeless after attacks by janjaweed Arab militias on the local black populace. The actor had been calling for a peacekeeping force to resolve the crisis.</p> <p>Glover, 58, was led away in handcuffs. Secret service officials said that the actor had been charged with disorderly conduct and unlawful assembly.</p> <p>Born in San Francisco, Glover came to fame in the mid-1980s with performances in Witness and The Color Purple. But his most abiding role was as Mel Gibson's pragmatic, family-man sidekick in the four Lethal Weapon outings. He recently completed work on Lars von Trier's forthcoming Manderlay.</p> <p>In recent years, however, Glover appears to have juggled acting with activism. He was appointed as a goodwill ambassador for the UN Development Program in 1998 and has recently been vocal in his criticism of the Bush administration's adventures in Iraq.

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>BREAKING NEWS:</b> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1291219,00.html\">A mortar attack on the main mosque in the Iraqi city of Kufa today killed 27 people and wounded 63 others, hospital officials and witnesses said</a>.</p> <p><b>MARK THATCHER CHARGED WITH FUNDING ATTEMPTED COUP</b></p> <p>It may have been the fact that Sir Mark Thatcher was robbed while in a holding cell ahead of his appearance in court over a coup plot yesterday, but his predicament reminds the Wrap of Dan Ackroyd's role in the 1983 US movie Trading Places.</p> <p>Ackroyd's character is a well-heeled businessman before everything starts to go wrong and at one stage he ends up crashing an exclusive Christmas party where he hides a large fish inside his Father Christmas suit.</p> <p>Things were certainly not going well Lady Thatcher's son early yesterday. when he was arrested by police at his GBP2.5m mansion in the upmarket Cape Town suburb of Constantia.</p> <p>As always when a member of the establishment gets in trouble, the papers crackle with schadenfreude. All the reports describe with thinly disguised delight that Sir Mark was apparently still wearing his pyjamas when the police arrived. </p> <p>He was later charged \"with helping to finance a failed attempt to overthrow the president of a tiny but oil-rich west African state\", the Guardian reports. Police said they had \"credible evidence\" Sir Mark was involved in plotting an armed coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea. His lawyer said he was held on suspicion of financing a helicopter gunship. </p> <p>Splashes in the Mail and the Mirror say that he faces 15 years in jail if convicted; the Sun, not to be outdone, reckons it could be 20 years.</p> <p>Sir Mark, 51, son of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, denied the charges. The Independent quotes him as saying: \"I have no involvement in an alleged coup in Equatorial Guinea and I reject all suggestions to the contrary.\"</p> <p>The Sun said Lady Thatcher, who is on holiday in the US, was \"devastated\" by the news of his arrest and that his twin sister Carol, a journalist, had said she was \"shocked\".</p> <p>According to the Mirror, the police squad that arrested Sir Mark, which is modelled on the FBI and known as the Scorpions, searched his home, examining documents and computers. The Mail said detectives moved because they feared he was about to leave the country for the US, which he quit in 1996 for South Africa. </p> <p>The Guardian, which says Sir Mark's business dealings had been the subject of \"repeated controversy since the 1980s\", called it a \"humiliating day\" and said he faced a legal battle to escape a jail term. </p> <p>The Sun, which estimates Sir Mark's fortune at GBP60m, said there might be an attempt by Equatorial Guinea to extradite him and notes that the country has an appalling human rights record, with claims that prisoners have been tortured. Equatorial Guinea's justice minister, however, played down any suggestion of extradition. </p> <p>The alleged participants in the attempted coup against Equatorial Guinea's president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema, were detained at Harare airport in Zimbabwe in March. </p> <p>Simon Mann, an Old Etonian former SAS officer, and heir to the Watney brewing empire, has been appearing in court in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, alongside 66 South Africans.</p> <p>Two days after the arrests in Zimbabwe, a further 15 men were arrested in Equatorial Guinea, where a separate trial is now ongoing. These men were allegedly an advanced party and are believed to have been led by a South African, Nick du Toit. </p> <p>Mr Du Toit has told a court in Equatorial Guinea that he had met Sir Mark, but only discussed \"a normal business deal\" to buy military helicopters for a mining enterprise in Sudan, the FT said. </p> <p>The Independent says the plotters are thought to have wanted to profit from the country's large oil reserves by installing the opposition leader Severo Moto, who is in exile in Spain.</p> <p>The Guardian says it has seen a copy of a letter written by Mr Mann from his Zimbabwe prison cell to his wife, demanding that his financial backers use their influence to get him released. In the letter, he appears to suggest that he was expecting USD200,000 from Sir Mark - using his nickname Scratcher - for an unspecified \"project\". </p> <p>Yesterday Sir Mark was ordered to pay bail of two million rand (GBP166,000), surrender his passport and return to court on November 25. He was not required to plead on any charges. </p> <p>Mr Obiang took power in a bloody coup in 1979, killing his own uncle to take the presidency.

The 432-year-old north London school plans to open a sixth form college and language school next year in Beijing catering almost entirely for Chinese students, the paper says. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/gcses2004/story/0,14504,1290962,00.html\">Action urged as underperforming boys eclipsed by girls in GCSEs</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=H2UAYGZG2LMBDQFIQMGSM5WAVCBQWJVC?xml=/news/2004/08/26/ngcse26.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/08/26/ixportaltop.html\">Telegraph: GCSEs crown record year</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/80dfe172-f6fc-11d8-a879-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Harrow to take boaters to Beijing</a></p> <p><b>SISTANI LEADS MARCH ON NAJAF</b></p> <p>The FT leads with the return to Iraq of the country's most revered Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, and the hopes he may be able to end the bloody siege at Najaf. </p> <p>Ayatollah Sistani, 73, who had been treated for a heart problem in London, has called for a mass demonstration today to try and end three weeks of fighting between American forces and Shia insurgents for control of the holy city. </p> <p>He is expected to lead a procession to the Imam Ali shrine where the last remnants of a militia force loyal to the rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr are holed up, besieged by US and Iraqi government forces.</p> <p>The Times warns that there are fears of a bloodbath among rival Shia factions if Ayatollah Sistani's followers move to eject Mr Sadr's militia from the shrine. </p> <p>Ayatollah Sistani crossed the border from Kuwait yesterday in a convoy and spent the night in Basra in southern Iraq.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1290819,00.html\">Defiant uprising seems to be near its end</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/535771.html\">IHT: Shia cleric looks to broker a deal</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/9715293c-f6d6-11d8-a879-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Sistani's return to Iraq may offer Najaf solution</a></p> <p> <b>UNITED AND NEWCASTLE SQUABBLE OVER ROONEY</b></p> <p>England striker and newspaper obsession Wayne Rooney wakes today to more palatable headlines than he has endured in recent days.

  "<p>I don't do science, though I love to read about it. What I do is fiction. They are such different activities that I sometimes wonder whether the same type of mind can do both. I'm not talking about science fiction; it's a respectable genre, with conventions (and Conventions, too), and a canon, and giants and minnows, and classics and trash, but I don't write it and don't much read it. I'm talking about all the rest, about the basic thing that's known as story. </p> <p>Because stories are fundamentally about individual human beings in human situations. They are the answers to questions such as What will happen when Oedipus meets Jocasta? What is Dorothea going to do when she realises she's made a terrible mistake in marrying that old stick Casaubon? What will Mr Bumble do when Oliver Twist asks for more? </p> <p>The tensions, expectations and satisfactions we get from fiction are of that sort, and it isn't science, because those aren't scientific questions. A scientific question, I take it, is one like What will happen if I drop two weights at the same moment? </p> <p>The difference is that once a scientific question is answered, it stays answered - at least, until someone changes the question. What is true for two objects of different weights will also be true, and in the same way, for another two objects of the same weights. There's an abstraction involved: we ignore the fact that this one's painted green, and the other's a bit rusty, and look only at the quality they have in common. Scientific statements are about similar entities behaving in similar ways; what is true for this elementary particle will be true for every other particle of the same kind. In fact, particles such as electrons are so similar that not even their mothers could tell them apart, and as I understand it, there's even a theory that there is only one electron in the universe, but it gets about a lot. </p> <p>There's no abstract human who will always behave in the same way - except in economics, where every human being is assumed to be rational and selfish to exactly the same degree as every other. No wonder it was called the Dismal Science. </p> <p>In real life, and in fiction, human beings are much more variable. There's only one Dorothea. However, the variability of fictional human beings involves an odd paradox: the more vividly particular and individual, the more distinct from every other invented character, the more recognisably truthful we think them. </p> <p>So doing science is not the same as doing fiction. But science as a background to fiction is different. It has to do what all backgrounds do - stand firm and solid. It must not sway alarmingly when someone walks into it or sound hollow when struck, it must conform to the rules of perspective and be vivid enough to convince but not so hectic as to distract. </p> <p>There's one further thing to say about backgrounds, and it's this: in a story, we are not on oath. We're not taking an exam. The function of research is not to provide me with lots of facts to put into a story unaltered, but to enable me to make up new \"facts\" that look convincing. The test can only be If I read this, in a book by someone else, would I be taken in? I can't hope to deceive a real expert, but I might deceive the moderately intelligent reader. And if a real expert did read it, I'd hope they might say This man's done a bit of homework. </p> <p>When it comes to science, it's not hard, these days, to find enough superb writers and fascinating material to satisfy your most demanding interior set-designer. In biology and evolution, there are Richard Dawkins, Steven Jay Gould, Jared Diamond, Jonathan Kingdon, EO Wilson; if it's physics that tickles your fancy, there are David Deutsch, Michio Kaku, Bryan Greene; to find out about cosmology, there are John Gribbin, Martin Rees, Paul Davies. And if you're intrigued by the deepest mystery of the lot, consciousness, you can read Antonio Damasio, and Adam Zeman, and Max Velmans, and VS Ramachandran ... I have read books by all these people, and I haven't even mentioned Roger Penrose. </p> <p>It isn't hard to find things out. But the best reason to read about science is not to check facts, but to revel in wonder. Part of the impulse behind my longest story lay in the extraordinary poetry of the phrase \"dark matter\", and my discovery that Milton had anticipated it in Paradise Lost: </p> <p>Unless the Almighty Maker them ordained<br>His dark materials to create new worlds </p> <p>When you come to write the story, you mustn't lose that first impulse of wonder. Science and fiction deal with different entities, and ask different questions; but each can intoxicate, inspire, console, and feed that appetite for mystery and revelation that makes human beings at least as interesting as electrons.</p>",
  "<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, someone had the idea that science would be at its most interesting when it was being subverted. Just as science itself was developing, storytellers began expanding the worlds of physics, biology, chemistry and engineering. </p> <p>They came up with a universe full of lightsabers, spaceships and robots, steeped in a heady brew of technobabble and draped on a background of journeys to exotic worlds. But science fiction is more than just pulp fiction; at its core is the desire to understand humanity's place in the universe. </p> <p>We asked leading scientists from around the world what science fiction meant to them: how they related to it and what influence it had on them. The answers showed that science fiction not only reflects science but is also an inspiration for it. This issue of Life is a celebration of that relationship. </p> <p>Robert May, population biologist and president of the Royal Society, says of science fiction: \"At its best it is very provocative and forethoughtful, like Asimov's books - they think of questions that have since arisen such as intelligent machines.\" Mark Brake, professor of science communication at Glamorgan University, says science fiction can be construed as an attempt to put meaning onto the idea of the universe proposed by Copernicus, who argued that humans, the Earth and our whole existence were nothing special. \"For 2,000 years, we felt that the entire universe was about us because it was geocentric and that humanity was at the centre of it,\" Brake says. </p> <p>The origins of the genre go back to the scientific revolution of the 17th century. Somnium, written by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler and published posthumously in 1634, tells of a young Icelander who travels to the moon. Kepler was, at least in part, responding to the discoveries made 30 years earlier by Copernicus and Galileo. </p> <p>Ever since Copernicus, Brake says, science fiction has been trying to address humanity's place in the universe by pitting human against non-human or addressing how little we actually know about the cosmos around us. \"Often it's about our humanity and the way humanity is changing as a result of the accelerating pace of change through science and technology.\" </p> <p>If Copernicus made us reconsider the position of humans in the universe, Charles Darwin forced us to reconsider ourselves in 1859. \"After the publication of The Origin of the Species, the style of science fiction changed to reflect that societies remained essentially the same, but that the people would change,\" says Steve Jones, the University College London geneticist and popular science writer. \"Darwin put forward that flesh is mutable.\" Jones argues that this led directly to HG Wells's The Time Machine in 1895, a tale of super-evolved human beings thousands of years in the future. </p> <p>Science fiction, a term coined in the 1930s to distinguish the genre from the pulp fiction then becoming popular, carried on examining human morality by placing its characters into situations where some limiting problem had been overcome, such as time travel. What the stories invariably showed was that science does not have all the answers, and that each advance throws up new questions. </p> <p>Brake says: \"Imperialist culture, from the point of view of spacefaring, has often been used in science fiction as a commentary on colonialism on the Earth. This goes back to The War of the Worlds, where Wells was disgusted with the almost complete annihilation of the Tanzanians and tried to turn the tables on Britain to ask: \"What would it feel like if you were invaded? It does use this extrapolative form to ask questions about the present.\" </p> <p>Science and society are clearly big influences on science fiction, but the opposite is true too. \"The best example of that is that it affects the public consciousness very often,\" says Brake. \"One of the reasons we use sci-fi is because we're interested in the public communication of science and extending the franchise of science, trying to get as many people interested as possible.\" </p> <p>Take the question of extraterrestrial life. Copernicus identified the fact that as neither the Earth nor humanity is central to the universe, there is a possibility that there is life beyond; Darwin found a mechanism for the evolution of life elsewhere. In 1995, scientists discovered extra-solar planets. But in all that time, the only scientific comment on the question of life and what that meant to science, had been in science fiction. It could even be argued that organisations like the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Seti) Institute in California and the existence of Nasa's astrobiology committee are an implicit recognition of the influence of science fiction. </p> <p>Fiction has certainly pushed the envelope for scientists. \"It helps you to think the impossible and see if it is possible,\" says Marcus du Sautoy, a mathematician at Oxford University. </p> <p>When Carl Sagan wanted to find a method of space-time travel for the novel Contact, he discussed with cosmologist Kip Thorne the idea that he might use black holes. Thorne argued against it, pointing out that Einstein's theory of general relativity did allow for the possibility of a \"wormhole\" if there was an advanced enough civilisation that could find enough negative energy to keep it open. Subsequently, Thorne even began researching a theoretical basis for wormholes. Brake says that The Time Machine in 1895 was 10 years ahead of the theory of special relativity. \"Einstein rethought physics, but you could argue that Wells was there before him, thinking about whether time travel was possible,\" he says. </p> <p>Even today's scientific institutions occasionally look for inspiration from fiction. The European Space Agency asked sci-fi fans if they had come across imaginative and inventive forms of spacecraft in books or films. \"In many cases the books are at least as sensible, if not more sensible than some of the science being done now,\" says May. </p> <p>As so many people are exposed to the ideas of science through science fiction, is there a responsibility for it to be scientifically accurate? \"No not at all, after all it is fiction,\" says Steve Jones. </p> <p>Brake argues, however, that different authors feel differing levels of responsibility. In any case, there are shades of grey with some science that fiction can legitimately play with.\"You could also say that, by its very nature, science fiction is extrapolative,\" he says. \"Science fiction involves a willing suspension of disbelief and it's not bound by the constraints of science. From our point of view, we try to identify two different sorts of science. There's normal science, which most people don't bother themselves with because its so dry and tedious and it goes on in labs from day to day that it wouldn't ruffle any feathers. Then there's something called controversial science - that's often the sort of science that science fiction confronts.\" </p> <p>In any case, there is such a thing as too much science in a story. Bill McGuire, director of the Benfield-Grieg Hazard Research Centre at UCL, says science fiction writers have a duty to educate but need a decent story, too. He gives the example of Darwin's Children, by Greg Bear: \"There is so much biology in it that it just swamps the story. The balance has to be right.\" </p> <p>But as a way of introducing budding scientists to the subject, science fiction does have value. Stephen Minger, a stem cell biologist at King's College London, says: \"I was born in 1955, it was the early days of space travel and the Apollo and mercury missions. I used to get up at three o'clock in the morning and watch the first rockets take off at Cape Canaveral back in the early 60s. I was really fascinated by the idea that we were going into space. It all tied in with the science fiction.\" </p> <p>Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the Seti institute in California, says of the 1953 film of The War of the Worlds: \"The film definitely interested me in astronomy and, ultimately, my work in Seti I'm sure is a consequence of some of those earlier films in which we were first encountering some of those mostly hostile creatures.\" </p> <p>Our panel of scientists shows that this interest in science fiction is still alive and well. Of the top 10 films, perhaps only 2001: A Space Odyssey and Solaris use or explore scientific ideas. That Star Wars makes it into the top 10 is a little surprising, as it is a story that could be set anywhere. The same could be said for The Matrix. </p> <p>\"I draw a distinction between films like Kubrick's 2001 and The Matrix,\" says May. \"The former is about ideas, where as the latter is essentially not science fiction, but more pretentious. It is a blend of brilliant technology and martial arts; the visual equivalent of pageturners, but devoid of ideas.\" </p> <p>Both Alien and Blade Runner were directed by Ridley Scott, a director sometimes criticised for style over depth. In these films, the future, in space and on Earth, provides the atmospheric backdrop for what are effectively a haunted house thriller and a LA-based gumshoe detective story. </p> <p>With the books, things were different. All the authors on the list are clearly defined as being science fiction writers, viewed as genre writers with limited mass appeal. They are authors mostly from the \"golden age\" of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. But the genre is thriving, with writers like Iain M Banks, Greg Bear and Gregory Benford. Even literary novelists such as Margaret Atwood dabble with science fiction, although she prefers to describe her Booker-shortlisted novel, Oryx and Crake, as speculative fiction. </p> <p>But what is clear is that like all science fiction, both Blade Runner and Asimov in his most famous work, I, Robot, focus on the questions that people have asked since civilisation began - what does it mean to be human?</p>",
  "<p>The food giant Heinz has changed the contents of all its tinned soups, increasing the \"quantity of ingredients\" while reducing fat, salt and sugar. </p> <p>The move is a further sign that the food industry is making efforts to keep ahead of legislation to improve the nation's diet and reduce obesity. The government's white paper on public health, due in October, is expected to make recommendations on food and diet-related diseases. </p> <p>The new Heinz tomato soup for example now contains 84% tomato compared with 74% in the old version. The company has also reduced salt levels by 20% to 1g per serving. Sugar has been reduced slightly from 5.2g per 100g to 4.9. The quantity of vegetable oil added has also been reduced. </p> <p>The reformulation of the soups has been accompanied by price rises of up to 20% to account for the cost of using more \"real\" ingredients. A tin of tomato soup costing 49p to 56p in supermarkets will now sell at 59p. </p> <p>\"We are working towards the Food Standards Agency guidelines on salt, which are pretty tough, and to achieving them over three years,\" marketing manager Dan Ince said. </p> <p>He added that the company was also working towards gradually reducing any \"technological ingredients\" in its soups. A new range of \"special soups\" has also been developed using \"only ingredients that could be found in the modern domestic kitchen\", and these will sell for 79p for 400g. Heinz tomato soup still contains modified cornflour, dried skimmed milk and whey protein. </p> <p>Heinz has taken the unusual step of replacing all its old stock in major supermarkets at once rather than introducing the new range gradually. It will spend \u00a310m on advertising in the autumn and has an additional budget of \u00a32.5m to cover the cost of credit for old stock and logistics to replace it. </p> <p>Replacing all its stock in every major supermarket branch in the country in one night will require 20,000 staff and 1,000 lorries. </p> <p>New deals on extra shelf space at the expense of competitors will justify the outlay. On average Heinz has negotiated a 25-30% rise in its share of space for soup in the main stores. </p> <p>The Heinz campaign is an example of the growing trend among big supermarkets to appoint a single dominant manufacturer to the role of \"category manager\". </p> <p>A category manager takes charge of a category of product in the supermarket, such as soup or bread, and works closely with retailers on research and marketing of that category for all other suppliers. </p> <p>In return they have access to confidential data from supermarkets' reward cards on cus tomers' spending habits. The competition commission report on supermarkets in 2000 said that this sort of close cooperation might reduce competition. </p> <p>Smaller manufacturers have expressed concern that it gives category managers an unfair advantage. </p> <p>\"We have been able to highlight other non-performers for the supermarkets,\" Mr Ince said, and some brands have been discontinued. </p> <p>Heinz has a 60% share of the total canned soup market. The Consumers' Association welcomed Heinz's move. \"It's good that they've taken these steps. We'd like to see further reduction and the reductions applied across their whole range of products,\" it said.</p> <p><strong>How the recipe changed</strong></p> <p><strong> Old Heinz tomato soup ingredients</strong> </p> <p>Tomatoes (74%), water, vegetable oil, sugar, modified cornflour, salt, dried skimmed milk, whey protein, cream, spice extracts, herb extract, citric acid </p> <p><strong> Contains per 100g</strong> </p> <p>Sugar 5.2g <br>Fat 3.6g <br>Sodium 0.4g <br></p> <p><strong> New Heinz tomato soup ingredients</strong> </p> <p>Tomatoes (84%), water, vegetable oil, sugar, modified cornflour, salt, dried skimmed milk, whey protein, cream, citric acid, spice extracts, herb extract <br></p> <p><strong>Contains per 100g</strong></p> <p>Sugar 4.9g<br>Fat 3.0g<br>Sodium 0.2g</p>",
  "<p>There was a blissful moment on holiday - shortly before a child had to be pulled out of a peat bog - when we paused. Whatever direction we looked in, however hard we listened, the only sign of human existence was our own. Three miles from the nearest road on the Ardnamurchan peninsula on the west coast of Scotland, we were in an eerie landscape of bog grass and huge boulders. Then, above our heads soared three eagles, and not long after, an adder slithered calmly between our feet. </p> <p>An annual dose of this remote wildness is an essential antidote to inner city life for me. The clouds of midges and rain are a small price to pay for its restorative properties. And the children get to feel rain, sun, wind, and discover wildlife beyond a television screen - childhood experiences which feel like essentials, not luxuries. But there's a fundamental contradiction behind our foray into the wilderness. It entails a round trip of 1,680 odd miles which accounts for almost half the carbon emissions for the year caused by the average individual. The rest of the year, I mostly use buses or cycle, but come the summer, I blow my credit in a spectacular carbon bonanza. How do you justify a journey that will damage the very experience you so much appreciate? </p> <p>That was the kind of questioning which environmental author Mayer Hillman put to his audience at an uncomfortable seminar to launch his book How We Can Save the Planet last month. A veteran campaigner on environmental issues, he's a Jeremiah figure, lambasting those who will listen for their moral failure to adapt their lifestyle to reduce carbon emissions. For an audience no doubt contemplating their imminent summer holidays, his rage against the scandal of growing carbon emissions from cheap air flights, made for some awkward shifting in seats. He never flies. His message on transport is stark: travel less and best of all, don't travel at all. </p> <p>The Blairs should be showing the way with a fortnight in Clacton-on-Sea instead of clocking up the air miles on the unforgivable, a twin-destination break in the Caribbean and Tuscany. I should swap holidays in Ardnamurchan for Essex, or better, stay at home. </p> <p>Hillman's message sounded pretty off the wall coming as it did at the beginning of the summer holidays. It was similarly brave of the Commons environmental audit committee to recommend that despite rising oil prices, the government must increase taxes on petrol to curb the increasing carbon emissions from cars at a time when Britain's roads are heaving with the annual migration. </p> <p>The unpalatable truth is that unless it hurts it ain't working. This week's hefty price increases for gas and electricity are the kind of thing that by 2010 could be commonplace. The era of affordable energy is drawing to a close and lifestyles built on its cheap abundance will have to be painfully adjusted. Take the simple matter of kitchen lighting (a subject of which I've had to grasp a sketchy knowledge in the past few weeks); while our parents would have happily had a single light bulb, Ikea sells halogen spots in packs of three and before you know it, the kitchen is a glowing festival, courtesy of nearly a dozen lights. </p> <p>Only excruciating utility bills will check the house make-over enthusiasts. It will take humungous hikes in fuel tax, with punishing electoral consequences, to wean us off the impulse to escape at least once a year from lives which we've made so hectic, we have to have a holiday to restore our sanity. It's a measure of how enormous the gap is between how we live and what needs to change in order to slow down climate change. </p> <p>Hillman has packed plenty of other tips for low carbon living into his daunting book. Don't boil your kettle so often; turn the heating down in the winter and wear woolly jumpers instead; use those dim, energy-efficient lightbulbs; recycle as much as you can, and take fewer showers. It sounds impossibly worthy, and rather smelly. What will induce people to take his advice? The analogy he draws is with his boyhood experience of rationing in the second world war. The crucial difference is that then the danger was immediate, but by the time climate change has a comparably direct, destructive impact on people's lives, it will be way too late to do much. The kind of odd weather we've had recently may be the first signs of climate change but it's hardly comparable so far to the danger of the Third Reich. </p> <p>Hillman's preoccupation is to get individuals to take personal responsibility for global warming and he provides formulae by which individuals can calculate their own carbon consumption. That takes him to the idea of personal carbon rations; every service or product we purchase would require not only a swipe of our debit card but also of our carbon card so that the carbon impact of our consumption is deducted. Here, I'm with him.</p> <p>While I'm sceptical about the value of persuading people of the virtues of fewer showers, in contrast, carbon rations has all the plausibility of an idea which will be commonplace in a couple of decades, perhaps sooner. If everyone is given the same allocation - a big \"if\" - it has the potential to be a radically redistributive measure with the less well-off able to sell their unused allocation. Until then, the dilemma is that the enormity of climate change makes individual action pretty meaningless. </p> <p>Giving up my trek to the Ardnamurchan peat bog would be a considerable personal sacrifice, but all the benefit of it would be handsomely cancelled out by a friend's weekend trip to New York (which produces carbon emissions the equivalent to two years' household gas supply). The moral exhortations of Hillman and fellow environmentalists don't gain fertile ground because they make no rational sense. </p> <p>The analogy of the meaningless individual sacrifices at an international level is that even if Britain blazed a trail of exemplary, carbon-friendly behaviour, all our efforts would be cancelled out by the carbon-belching US. The solutions to climate change have to be collective, involving not just the local community or even nation, but the entire globe. Never before has humanity had to recognise its common identity as a species, over and above race, nationality or creed.

  "Tories yesterday labelled wide-ranging schemes to revive inner cities an \"outdated obsession\" in a policy reversal aimed at diverting resources to the country's towns and decaying suburbs. <p>Building on modest gains in local elections three months ago, when some towns and outer city areas returned to Tory control, the party labelled suburbia a forgotten part of England crying out for help. </p> <p>Launching a Conservative urban alliance beside a vandalised bowling pavilion in North Tyneside, one of the Tories' new northern strongholds, the shadow family minister Theresa May ridiculed \"stereotypical\" concepts of many cities. </p> <p>\"To many, the word 'urban' conjures up images of chic living in converted lofts, 24-7 lifestyles led by aspiring young professionals,\" she told Tory councillors and party workers in North Tyneside, a largely suburban borough run by Conservatives through an elected executive mayor. </p> <p>\"For a generation, policy making has been increasingly concerned with 'the problem of the inner cities' without recognising that the problems we are seeing there are common to all our urban areas.\" </p> <p>The alliance, which Mrs May will chair, aims to highlight the deteriorating suburbs, from litter-strewn roads and parks to run-down town centres - policy areas which increasingly top voters' concerns, ahead of education and health, according to polls. </p> <p>\"If when you walk out of your front door you trip over the pavement because it's uneven, the rubbish hasn't been collected, the street lights aren't working, there's graffiti on the walls, litter is blowing around the streets, another shop window in the parade is boarded up because of vandalism ... you feel like you've been through a battleground before you even get to work,\" Mrs May added. </p> <p>\"Under this government, the outdated obsession with their solutions for the inner city at the expense of suburbs and towns, has produced a plethora of initiatives and schemes ... (yet) a recent poll showed the vast majority of people expected to see the quality of their streets and sur roundings to get worse.\" </p> <p>As well as being led by a Tory mayor, Linda Arkley, Conservatives constitute the largest political group on North Tyneside council, which had been Labour-run since its creation 30 years ago. </p> <p>A former nurse, Mrs Arkley, who has had to deal with a multi-million pound deficit in a council labelled 'poor' by the Audit Commission, was presented yesterday as the new urban face of Conservatism. </p> <p>In truth the area chosen for yesterday's launch - a park and boating lake beside the seaside prom at Tynemouth - lies in a pleasant part of northern suburbia, which generally elects Tory councillors. </p> <p>But it has not escaped vandalism and petty crime. Overnight, a bowling pavilion was broken into and vandalised. Mrs Arkley's response is to unleash a new force of and an anti-graffiti team to clean up her borough. \"They attend 350 incidents a month and remove 2,000 square metres of graffiti every four weeks,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>It sounds like a sci-fi nightmare, but it could be every teenage geek's dream: a computer worm that can wriggle into bedrooms and secretly hijack webcams to spy on people. </p> <p>A warning was issued yesterday about a new \"peeping Tom\" computer virus that can take over computers and invade homes and businesses. </p> <p>The Rbot-GR worm installs itself in users' machines like a normal virus, but then secretly takes control of the webcam and microphone, sending images and sound back to the hacker who dispatched it. </p> <p>The virus enables hackers to see everything another user does in front of their computer and hear everything they say without their knowledge if their webcam is switched on, according to Sophos, an Oxford-based anti-virus firm. </p> <p>The worm, which affects only personal computers with Windows software, can also look at information on the hard drive of an infected computer and steal passwords. </p> <p>Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, said Rbot-GR had been detected in the past few days, but it remained a rare virus at this stage. </p> <p>While the worm could be a lucrative tool for thieves and hi-tech industrial espionage, it is likely to prove more popular with teenage hackers who want to snoop around strangers' bedrooms. </p> <p>\"This particular worm can capture what is on your webcam,\" said Mr Cluley. </p> <p>\"Even if the camera is switched off, it will try switching it back on. </p> <p>\"Whether this worm is the work of professional snoopers or lusty teenagers - it is hard to say for certain. My theory is that the average hacker is a young male and the thought of spying on other people's bedrooms can be quite intoxicating. </p> <p>\"I think it is mostly out of curiosity. Previously worms have been programmed to look at your hard disk, but this one can look in the room around your computer.\" </p> <p>Computer users, particularly those with machines in their bedrooms or a broadband connection which permanently links them to the internet, are advised to ensure they have the latest anti-virus software. Users can also protect their privacy by ensuring their webcam is unplugged or the lens is covered with tape when it is not in use. </p> <p>As news of the worm spread around the global internet community, users on the message boards of Slashdot greeted the news with glee. </p> <p>One said: \"I think I speak for the majority of geeks who can't get any when I ask: where can I get said worm?\"</p>",
  "<p>Banco Santander Central Hispano's bid for Abbey National, Britain's sixth-largest retail bank, took a further twist this week. HBOS, the UK's fifth-biggest bank, complained to the European commission on Monday that the Spanish bank is tied to the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) through cross-ownership of shares. It also pointed out that two Santander executives sit on the RBS board, while the RBS chairman has a position on Santander's board. </p> <p>\"HBOS says it would be unacceptable for the RBS chairman to sit on the board of a company that owned one of the major challengers to the large UK banks,\" reported the Spanish daily <strong>El Pa\u00eds</strong>. \"The EC has until September 17 to decide whether to clear the Abbey deal.\" </p> <p>The Lombard column of the <strong>Financial Times</strong> wondered if HBOS was \"running for a prize as the biggest wind-up merchant in Europe\". If it went ahead with a counter-bid for Abbey, \"the competition issues would be so serious they would take at least six months to resolve. This would push out to the end of March, when Santander's \u00a38.3bn bid is due to lapse.\" </p> <p>The <strong>Scotsman</strong>'s Scrutineer column argued that HBOS had every right to complain. \"In no sector across the UK would two of the top six companies be allowed to send secret messages to each other against the other members of the group. Not without a competition outcry anyway,\" it said. \"If Santander buys Abbey it will be competing with RBS, making the continuation of the relationship a form of collusion.\" </p> <p>For Neil Collins in the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>, the complaint was little more than a further attempt to put Santander off, \"following revelations last week about its lavish corporate HQ, fabulous pay-offs to former directors and concerns about the quality of its South American loan book\". </p> <p>Such \"lurid tales\" were to HBOS's advantage, said the Breaking Views column in the <strong>Wall Street Journal Europe</strong>. \"The principal alternative to Santander's mainly share-funded bid would be a similarly denominated offer from HBOS itself. The more the UK bank undermines the attractiveness of the foreign player, the smaller the pre mium it would have to pay.\" </p> <p>HBOS intervention might also prompt Abbey shareholders to examine Santander's business operations, reckoned Patience Wheatcroft in the <strong>Times</strong>. \"From a corporate governance point of view, it is not run on parallel lines to British banks,\" she said. \"This is most obvious in the boardroom, where, despite holding just 3% of the shares, the Botin family exercise control.\" </p> <p>This week's developments were also a boon to Abbey shareholders who were less than compelled by the Santander bid because it is largely in shares, said an editorial in the Financial Times. \"Owning equity in a Spanish-listed bank is unattractive for individual British investors, who dominate the share register. They foresee problems in dealing in Santander shares, retrieving withholding tax deducted from dividends and holding investments denominated in euros. A counter-bid from a British bank would avoid such problems and might also force Santander to improve its offer.\" </p> <p>Alf Young in the Glasgow <strong>Herald</strong> said HBOS \"believes it can convince the UK competition authorities that a 34% combined share of the British mortgage market is no impediment to competition\". Either way, said the <strong>Daily Mail</strong>'s Ruth Sunderland, it was a \"canny\" move by James Crosby, the chief executive of HBOS. \"Mr Crosby is in a virtually no-lose situation,\" she noted. \"If he bags his prey, he will dominate the British mortgage market. Even if he loses, his gatecrashing has undermined Santander's credibility. He has even been allowed to see key information on Abbey as a result of his expression of interest.\" </p> <p>Although HBOS's chances of successfully countering Santander were slim, agreed Jeremy Warner in the <strong>Independent</strong>, Mr Crosby seemed to believe \"he owes it to his shareholders to at least try ... For him, the prize is the mouth-watering one of the biggest cost-cutting merger since RBS's acquisition of National Westminster Bank. Yet his already slender chances of being waved through without a competition commission investigation would shrink to nothing at all if rival UK banks enter the fray.\"</p>",
  "<p>She's one of the most idolised women in the world, she's blonde and gorgeous, she has perfect teeth, she's worth gazillions, she mixes with the cream of the A-list. You're a whelk-seller from Cromer, your big passion in life is Norwich City, you have badly bleached hair and Norfolk teeth, your only previous celebrity encounter was when Pat Butcher once came and bought some shrimps from you. So, <strong> Can You Pull ... Britney?</strong> (E4). </p> <p>This show is a novel one. It tries to get crazed fans romantically involved with the celebrities they idolise - kind of dating-cum-stalking. First up, then, is Spencer Gray the whelk man, for whom an interview with an unsuspecting Britney Spears is somehow secured. \"I can just imagine her in here now, selling seafood,\" says Spencer, nodding to his stall. \"She'd love that, wouldn't she?\" </p> <p>Before their meeting, Spencer has to do his homework. He's packed off to Britney's home town of Kentwood, Louisiana, to do some background research on the woman he hopes is the future Mrs Gray, seafood queen of north Norfolk. It doesn't go well. Britney's mother has a headache and won't see him, and neither will Nyla, who owns Britney's favourite burger restaurant. In fact, no one will speak to poor Spencer. </p> <p>And back in England, at a posh London hotel, the interview doesn't go much better. \"I'm so nervous, I'll probably mess this right up,\" Spencer begins. Then the shellfish man just clams up. </p> <p>\"Do you have some questions for me?\" asks Britney, politely. </p> <p>For a while, things pick up. She pretends to be interested when Spencer tells her about his little seafood place on the Cromer seafront. He gives her a Norwich City shirt - she's a singer after all, she must be a Canary, perhaps that was the thinking. And a jar of Colman's mustard. But when Spencer mentions his little fact-finding trip to Kentwood, and the people he tried to talk to, the stalking alarm visibly goes off behind Britney's saccharine smile. Who is this weird guy who speaks funny and has been sniffing around my home town? She glances over to her people with a look that says: \"Make this thing stop. Right now.\" </p> <p>Spencer just has time to have a pop at the queen of pop before she's taken away by her minders. \"If you're about later and that,\" he stammers, \"I'll be down in the bar, we'll go and have a few drinks 'cos I'm here for the evening ... \" </p> <p>\"OK,\" says Britney, meaning: \"No way, freak.\" </p> <p>Spencer never gets to find out if she turns up - because they don't let him in to the bar. \"I was devastated,\" he says, sadly. </p> <p>It's all very silly, and a bit mean, but it's nice to see celebrities used as stunt fodder. I just wish Britney had fallen for Spencer, who totally deserved her. It's possible that she would have finally found the meaning of happiness, working in a Cromer seafood stall. Oops, I made a crab sandwich again ... </p> <p> <strong> Death By Silicone</strong> (Channel 4) was a scary documentary about illegal backstreet plastic surgery in Miami. If anyone ever invites you to a \"pumping party\", you're busy, washing your hair - whatever, just don't go. They start off normally enough - cross-dressing, cocaine, that kind of thing. But then people start injecting industrial-grade silicone into each other. Churchgoer Vera Lawrence died at one, after having had enormous quantities of silicone pumped into her buttocks. It wasn't J-Lo she was after, it was the \"Jessica Rabbit look\". She died trying to look like a cartoon character. </p> <p>It slightly took the wind out of the sails of <strong> Nip/Tuck</strong> (Channel 4), the drama series about plastic surgery in Miami, which followed immediately afterwards.

  "Twelve days after undergoing heart surgery in London, the Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, returned to Iraq yesterday to try to reclaim control over the holy shrines of Najaf and end the uprising that has threatened to destabilise the south of the country. <p>The 73-year-old cleric crossed Iraq's border from Kuwait at noon yesterday in a guarded motorcade as his aides called on Iraqis to march to Najaf and \"seize\" the holy city from the fighters of the rebel cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and the US and Iraqi forces besieging them. </p> <p>\"His aim is to stop the bloodshed,\" said Murtadha al-Kashmiri, a Sistani representative. \"Those believers who wish to join him, let them join.\" Mohammed Bahr Ul Uloum, a mainstream Shia cleric who used to sit on Iraq's governing council, said: \"Despite the critical state of his health, Sayed Sistani has responded to the desperate pleas for peace in the holy city that is also his home.\" </p> <p>Ayatollah Sistani had been in London for medical treatment since August 6, one day after clashes erupted in Najaf. He underwent angioplasty to unblock an artery. The ayatollah's surprise return came as fighting continued near the shrine of Imam Ali, one of Shia Islam's most sacred sites - though many al Mahdi fighters were seen streaming out of the city yesterday. </p> <p>The violence, which has spread to other southern Iraqi towns as well as Shia districts of Baghdad, has killed or wounded hundreds of Iraqis and undermined support for Iraq's interim government. It has also alienated many moderates among the Shia majority whose support is considered vital to the country's nascent political process.</p> <p>Mr Bahr Ul Uloum said the grand ayatollah would spend the night in Basra, before travelling to Najaf today, gathering supporters in the southern cities of Nassiriya, Samawa and Diwaniya. </p> <p>He said he and a delegation of tribal and religious leaders from Najaf and the surrounding region would meet the ayatollah and his supporters on the edge of the holy city and march with them to the shrine. </p> <p>\"If the fighting is still going on, the ayatollah will call on everyone to put down their guns,\" Mr Bahr Ul Uloum said. \"Then he will go the holy shrine, pray, and receive the keys to the holy shrine.\" </p> <p>After that the political process would take over to resolve \"outstanding issues\" between Mr Sadr and the interim government, he said. </p> <p>Until now, Ayatollah Sistani has been reluctant to involve himself directly in the Najaf crisis. Like other moderate Shia leaders in Iraq, he has avoided open criticism of Mr Sadr, who lacks Ayatollah Sistani's scholarly standing, for fear of stoking tensions among Shias at a time when the long-oppressed community is emerging as the country's most dominant group. </p> <p>But Ayatollah Sistani's supporters are alarmed at the effectiveness of Mr Sadr's populist anti-American message, which appeals to the Shia poor. The ayatollah, by contrast, has shown tolerance for the US presence in the hope that Washington would withdraw from Iraq once an elected government takes office. </p> <p>The interim government appeared to have been caught on the hop by Ayatollah Sistani's return. A foreign diplomat in Baghdad, said: \"If Mr Sistani is successful it will be good and bad news for the government. It offers them a peaceful way out of a dangerous situation but it will also be an affirmation of the enormous prestige he commands.\" </p> <p>For their part, supporters of Mr Sadr acknowledged it would be difficult to resist a direct demand from Ayatollah Sistani to disarm. </p> <p>Adnan al Safi, editor-in-chief of the pro-Sadr Al-Salam newspaper, said: \"Sayed Ali Sistani is a peaceful man and he will try his best to end this issue of Najaf peacefully. But the Iraqi government and the US should stop firing.\" </p> <p>The militant cleric had already agreed to calls by last week's national conference to move out of the shrine, disarm, and turn the Mahdi army into a peaceful organisation in return for amnesty for his followers. But he demanded a truce first. </p> <p>Last night thousands of Ayatollah Sistani's followers tried to reach Najaf after the cleric's call for them to march on the city's Imam Ali shrine. Najaf's chief of police gave orders to block all roads leading to the city and instructed officers to shoot demonstrators if they failed to turn back. At least two people were killed yesterday when police in Kufa opened fire on demonstrators.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Dying Psions</strong><br> I have a Psion Series 5mx, which suits me admirably, but I have had to have it repaired three times, so it is getting expensive. Is it time to move to a PDA, and if so, which one should I choose? At the moment, I don't use a desktop PC.  <strong> Gerald Ramshaw</strong> </p> <p><strong> Jack Schofield replies: </strong> The Psion was designed to work as a standalone computer, and none of the modern devices really does that job quite as well. Today's PDAs (personal digital assistants) tend to work best when seen as companions to desktop computers, where you drop them into a cradle every night to synchronise data and recharge them. (You can't get Psion-style battery life if you are driving a bright, backlit colour screen.) However, if you like Psions, I think your best bet is a Nokia Communicator, which is based on the Symbian operating system - derived from Psion Epoc - and comes with a good suite of software. It also has a built-in phone. The Nokia 9500, due out later this year, has a colour screen, 80MB of memory and a VGA camera, and it supports four wireless standards: GSM, GPRS, Wi-Fi and <a href=\"http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,54106,00.html\">Bluetooth</a>. Apart from the keyboard, which is not up to Series 5 standards, it looks like today's ultimate upgrade for Psion users. However, it does far more than you need. </p> <p>A cheaper option is to switch to a new system, where the main choices are Palm-powered and Windows CE-powered devices such as Pocket PCs. These are now more or less equivalent, though I'd expect a standalone Psion user to have a preference for the Palm interface. Have a look at the Palm Tungsten T3 and any of the Pocket PC handhelds. The best value at the moment is probably the Dell Axim X31. </p> <p>Alternatively, you could extend your use of Psion handhelds by shopping on eBay. Series 5 machines typically go for \u00a340 to \u00a350, and even clean-looking late models go for less than \u00a3100. Although Psions have known problems with hinges and screens, you can probably buy two second-hand models for the same price as one repair. </p> <p><strong> SP2 or not SP2?</strong><br> Shall I install XP SP2 or not? My computer is working so well at present, I'm reluctant to do something that appears likely to cause disruption. I don't have broadband, and my Virgin.net account is pay-as-you-go.  <strong> Naomi Connelly</strong> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> Every Windows XP user should plan on installing Service Pack 2 at some point, but it is going to take Microsoft a long time to upgrade 300m machines, and you don't need to be at the front of the queue. If you have a brand new machine (and therefore a standard software installation) and a broadband connection, get SP2 as soon as possible. If you have an older system with malware problems, it is worth getting in the queue now. If you don't have problems, you can certainly wait until any glitches are ironed out. And if you don't have broadband, wait until SP2 becomes widely available on CD. Microsoft UK is planning to distribute SP2 on a million CDs, and you will soon be able to order a free copy (no charge for post and packing) from <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/uk/windowsxp/sp2/\">www.microsoft.com/uk/windowsxp/sp2</a>. </p> <p><strong> Pest control</strong><br> I would like to get rid of the ISearch toolbar, which I inadvertently must have downloaded.

With parasites, SpyBot Search &amp; Destroy and Lavasoft's Ad-aware are trustworthy: both are free, so if you are asked for money, you are at the wrong site. </p> <p>For those in funds, I recommend Pest Patrol and Webroot's Spy Sweeper.

Andy Munro, from Munro Acoustics Ltd, says: \"Another potential cause of monitor interference comes from loudspeakers, even shielded ones. Decent speakers (with large voice coils) send out an electro-magnetic pulse when hit with a heavy current. This can travel several metres and cause CRTs to distort. We often resort to LCD screens in recording studios to avoid the problem.\" </p> <p>Mark Sheldrake adds: \"I had similar trouble with a 'wobbly' monitor, but cured it by not using the microwave in the kitchen at the same time as I was using the PC: they backed on to the same wall!\" </p>",
  "<p>Burnout 3<br> PS2, Xbox \u00a339.99 Criterion/Electronic Arts,<br> **** </p> <p> With franchise merchants such as Electronic Arts coming under much criticism recently for failing to come up with new intellectual properties (deemed particularly important with the next generation of consoles looming), the third instalment of a driving game would not appear to hold much appeal. But Burnout 3 flies - or rather crashes, extravagantly, with a series of barrel-rolls - in the face of such conventional wisdom. </p> <p>It adds few features from previous versions - apart from support for Xbox Live and the ability to steer your car even in mid-crash - but is more polished and much improved structurally. In gameplay terms, that adds up to the most adrenaline-infused and addictive game released this year. </p> <p>As before, you face a series of challenges on road circuits full of traffic that moves incredibly realistically. To charge up your turbo-boost, you must drive on the wrong side of the road, slide round corners, narrowly miss oncoming traffic, get airborne and take out rival road-racers. </p> <p>The pleasingly non-linear structure sees you taking part in races, where you must try to force your opponents to crash; eliminators, where the last car is blown up at the end of each lap; and crashes, where you seek to cause spectacular pile-ups. There are great team-based online games, too, but what really motivates is the style of the crashes. Add a great indie-rock soundtrack, featuring the likes of Franz Ferdinand, and you have a must-buy package. <br> <strong> Steve Boxer</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Ghost Recon: Jungle Storm</strong><br> Nokia N-Gage, \u00a324.99 Gameloft/Gameloft,<br> **** </p> <p> After a rocky start, the restyled N-Gage is beginning to shine. Spiderman 2 was a cracker and this latest incarnation of Tom Clancy's jungle warfare sim is just as good. </p> <p>What strikes you is how good a job the developers have done on the 3D, with buildings scaling smoothly into view, and above-average animation. There's even the odd cinematic set-piece and the kind of fine detail that usually gets left out in the transition to smaller formats, such as Clancy's traditional obsession with big guns, offering plenty of weapons to choose from before each mission. </p> <p>What problems there are have more to do with the N-Gage design. Moving and strafing without a proper raised joypad is hard enough, but aiming with the left hand at the same time makes negotiating the busier levels more a matter of memory than skill. However, you do get eight large missions with consistently varied objec tives - from rescuing hostages to the usual raising hell - and your three colleagues do a pretty good job of supporting you on their own initiative. </p> <p>The music and sound are top notch and there's even a multiplayer mode. This is an impressive conversion that will be familiar to fans of Ghost Recon on other formats. In the absence of a GBA rival, it's the best handheld version of the franchise. <br> <strong> Mike Anderiesz</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Sudeki</strong> <br> Xbox, \u00a339.99 Climax/Microsoft,<br> *** </p> <p> Crazy name, pretty decent game. Sudeki is a Western take on the Japanese role playing game (RPG) genre. Players control a party of four, each with different skillsets, such as shooting or hand-to-hand combat. </p> <p>As with all RPGs, the plot is important, driving players on to the next area or challenge. Unfortunately, Sudeki's is a slightly disappointing cliche, although ex-Doctor Who actor Tom Baker's narration adds gravitas. </p> <p>In reality, it is the combat and pretty graphics that are the pull. From the start Sudeki looks gorgeous, with wonderfully realised environments that give a sense of space and disguise the linearity of design. And then there is the combat. There are a lot of opponents in this game as, in true RPG fashion, players need to kill these to gain the experience points to \"level up\". Do this and greater powers and weaponry become available. </p> <p>It is a good job, then, that the combat system is such fun. By tapping buttons in time, players can perform powerful combo moves. Then there are the special skill strikes that slow game time down with devastating effect. Sadly, the first person shooting elements of two of the characters are a disappointment and out of place in an RPG. Also poor are the puzzles, which are so elementary as to be pointless. </p> <p>Ultimately, Sudeki lacks a bit of soul, with none of the attachment to characters that great RPGs engender. For all that, it offers a good-looking summer adventure on your Xbox. <br> Greg Howson</p>",
  "<p>The announcement that British Gas is to increase its residential prices by another 12% this year, and electricity prices by more than 9%, will send a chill through the wallets of its customers - even if the increase is no surprise for those who have been watching wholesale prices creep upwards. </p> <p>Coming at a time when international oil prices are hovering around record levels, up by 40% from a year earlier, the prospect of more expensive energy prices throughout the economy sounds a dire note. But it is not just energy prices that are rising: around the world, commodity prices have also been rising strongly during the past year. From soybeans to iron ore, the costs of raw materials have been steadily increasing. </p> <p>A sign of these rising times is the news that Britain's exports of scrap metal are on course to top the \u00a31bn a year mark, putting it on a par with this country's exports of machine tools and appliances. What this shows - other than the long observed decline in the British manufacturing sector - is the appetite for humble scrap for furnaces in places such as Japan and Turkey. </p> <p>But what is good news for Britain's scrap merchants and car wreckers is not necessarily best for British consumers. The global background of rising commodity prices - and the resurgent fuel costs driving up the transport charges in moving them around the globe - is likely to cause a knock-on effect in terms of rising prices generally. </p> <p>While this is already being felt at the petrol pump, and shortly in gas and electricity bills, the cumulative effect may well be a gradual rise in the overall price level, and presumably lead to a surge in inflation. The increased gas and electricity charges, if passed on to consumers across the board, will add something like 0.3 percentage points to overall inflation on its own, while higher oil prices can be expected to add a similar proportion. </p> <p>Does this mean we should brace our selves for a rerun of the energy shocks of the 1970s? Almost certainly not - especially as fuel prices are still far below 1970s levels when adjusted for inflation. What it does mean is that the triple crown of rock-bottom commodity prices, weak inflation and low interest rates that the UK and the rest of the world's developed economies have enjoyed for the last six or seven years has come to an end. </p> <p>Since the implosion of the \"Asian tiger\" economies in 1997, followed by the disruption in Russia and other emerging markets, the industrialised nations have benefited from the background of lower prices, which encouraged a brief but robust period of economic growth. Now, though, many of the tigers are roaring again, and have been joined by China, the biggest beast in the jungle, and by a recovery in Japan. Brazilian soybean farmers and iron ore producers are better off, while Britain's consumers are likely to pay higher prices. </p> <p>This does not mean that we can expect some sort of Soylent Green-style dystopia in the short term, or even the long term. Higher gas and oil prices does mean less money for consumers to spend elsewhere. The country will be a little worse off, in terms of lower growth than in recent years. That is bad news for the government's fiscal position, if it is banking on projections of rising taxable incomes to bail it out. Should a sustained rise in the consumer price index lead to higher interest rates and lower economic growth, then the political fallout could become distinctly uncomfortable for the government. </p> <p>But there are some bright spots. One is that higher prices for carbon-emitting fuels such as gas or oil make the cost of alternative energy sources cheaper by comparison. That should encourage the investment in, and widespread adoption of, renewable energy in the form of wind, wave and solar generators: no panacea to be sure, but no bad thing.</p>",
  "<p>Johnston Press, publisher of the Yorkshire Post and Sheffield Star, promised yesterday to grow its non-newspaper businesses as it conceded that consolidation in the regional market has reached a temporary peak. </p> <p>The fourth-largest regional newspaper group in the UK, which publishes 241 titles, said it would branch out from its traditional business as the success of new magazines and job supplements helped Johnston post a 16% rise in first-half profits. </p> <p>Tim Bowdler, chief executive of Johnston, said the group would focus on organic growth for the rest of the year as the regional market enters a deal-making hiatus following years of acquisition and merger activity. Johnston has been a big beneficiary of consolidation among regional publishers, buying Regional Independent Media, owner of the Yorkshire Post, for \u00a3560m two years ago. </p> <p>\"We cannot necessarily rely, as we have historically, on the frequency of acquisitive growth that we have to date. We have to drive the business harder and rely on what we have,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Bowdler added that acquisitions were not being ruled out, but \"timing is not something we control\". </p> <p>The top three newspaper publishers - Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, Trinity Mirror and Gannett - are not expected to quit one of the most recession-proof media markets in the UK and many of the 20 largest regional groups are closely held businesses. </p> <p>Mr Bowdler said Johnston launched 30 products in the first half of the year, with 18 lifestyle publications including a \"dirtbike magazine\" and 12 newspaper-style products linked to regional employment and property markets. </p> <p>Johnston reported a closing of the north-south divide that has polarised the regional market, as revenues in the six months to end-June rose 5% to \u00a3261m. </p> <p>Faltering economic growth in the south-east, particularly in the jobs market, has hit publications such as the Evening Standard and publishers with a significant exposure to southern England, such as Trinity Mirror. The group last month reported a \"partial\" recovery in the south and Mr Bowdler said job advertising revenues at Johnston's southern titles had grown 10% over the period. </p> <p>\"The north-south divide has narrowed significantly. We have seen a return to quite healthy job advertising growth in the south of the country.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bemused, bewildered and blissful, Bradley Wiggins yesterday became the first Briton since 1964 to take three medals in a single Olympic games. He and his madison relay partner Rob Hayles - bloodied and bruised as well as blissful - won bronze in a display of colossal guts and ice-cold composure. </p> <p>All had seemed lost when Hayles fell off shortly after half-distance, and the duo's untrammelled joy as the race finished turned into an agonising wait after the German team put in an appeal over the distribution of points. The judges threw it out, and for once sporting justice was done. </p> <p>Already the winner of the individual pursuit and a silver medallist - again with Hayles - in the team pursuit, the 24-year-old Londoner was overwhelmed to have matched Mary Rand's haul in Tokyo in 1964 of a gold in the long jump, silver in the pentathlon, and bronze in the 4x100 relay. For a British cyclist, it is a unique feat. </p> <p>\"I was told a few times that this was possible, but this sort of thing only happens to other people,\" said Wiggins. \"I never, ever thought that anything like this could happen to me. It's terribly hard to take in. I'm still in a bubble here, and I'll have to wait and see what the response is when I get home, but it's mindblowing for me.\" </p> <p>This 50-kilometre event is the longest Olympic track discipline, and is a curious cycling variant on tag wrestling, with one of each of the two-man teams circling the track slowly while his colleague races for a couple of laps before grabbing his hand and slinging him bodily into the fray. The object is to gain laps on the field, and score points which are awarded every 20 laps and are used to separate teams finishing on the same lap. </p> <p>\"The [individual] pursuit was incredible, the team pursuit was hard and a bit disappointing, but I had a day off yesterday, had some time away from the village and even managed to have a pint of beer, which must have done me more good than harm. I came here relaxed and ready for it.\" </p> <p>He will find out soon enough how the British public responds when he rides next week's Tour of Britain as the leader of his Cr\u00e9dit Agricole team. His response since taking gold in the individual pursuit has been exemplary, however. </p> <p>On Sunday and Monday he tried his damnedest to assist the team pursuiters in the latest episode in their lengthy, frustrating quest for victory over the Australians, and after that he could have been forgiven for relaxing a little as only the eighth Briton to take a gold and silver medal in one games in the post-war era. </p> <p>This race was unfinished business, though. In Sydney, Hayles had crashed and broken his collarbone with two laps to go when the pair were in the silver-medal position, and they were relegated to fourth. \"It haunts me,\" said Hayles before yesterday's start. </p> <p>With 36 cyclists spread out over the 250 metres, travelling at up to 40mph, this is an adrenalin-fuelled, dazzling spectacle, but not easy on the nerves as cyclists weave past each other continually and throw their team-mates with gay abandon with inches to spare. </p> <p>\"I was about to attack, but a French guy swung up in front of me and I clipped his wheel,\" said Hayles. \"If it had been a car accident it would have been my fault because I hit him from behind, but I'm blaming him. I had visions of Sydney and thought 'oh my God, the British public must think I'm an idiot'.\" He landed heavily on his left side, got up rapidly, with his hip and elbow skinned raw. \"A few beefburgers,\" as their coach Simon Jones put it. </p> <p>Riders are allowed four laps out for such an incident and Wiggins merely remained \"in the race\" while Hayles got back on a replacement bike but he quickly needed a second bike change. \"It was the same one I fell off on in Sydney, so I wanted to get rid of it as quickly as possible. I knew I was OK, it was a question of getting my breath back and going for the lap near the end when everyone was tired.\" </p> <p>They had made a superb start, taking an early sprint, and were well-placed in fourth but, with Hayles pedalling stiffly and painfully, they slipped to seventh. But Wiggins said: \"I knew we had to wait for the right moment.\" It came with 32 laps remaining when Wiggins, who had looked the strongest and smoothest rider throughout, shot out of the string of riders in a last-ditch attempt to gain the lap that would put them back with the leaders. </p> <p>It took 10 laps of all-out effort to achieve the lap gain but it brought the crowd to their feet. It took the duo into the silver-medal position, but the next sprint edged the Swiss past them. The finishing sprint was all that remained; Wiggins raced his heart out from five to go to keep the pair well placed, and it fell to Hayles to hold off Ukraine and New Zealand. </p> <p>Cruel luck, and the implacable judges had already deprived the pair's team-mate Jamie Staff of a probable medal in the keirin. The world champion had fought his way back into the final after going out in the first round of this event in which riders are paced for six laps by a small, puttering motorbike piloted by a grim-looking driver in a black catsuit. </p> <p>Staff was judged to have obstructed another rider in the final two-lap dash for the line en route to winning the second round, and was disqualified. It seemed harsh, given that every round involved bumping, boring and jostling which led to two heavy crashes, and the former BMX world champion was devastated. At 31, this may have been his only chance for an Olympic medal, and for him, unlike Wiggins and Hayles, there may be no sweet revenge. </p> <p><strong>Gold, silver and bronze in same games post-war: </strong></p> <p><strong> Bradley Wiggins </strong> 2004 Gold in individual pursuit, silver in team pursuit, bronze in madison </p> <p> <strong> Mary Rand </strong> 1964 Gold in long jump, silver in pentathlon, bronze in 4x100m </p> <p><strong> Gold and silver at the same games </strong></p> <p><strong> William Laurie </strong> 1948 Gold coxless pairs, silver eights gold coxless pairs, silver eights </p> <p> <strong> Ann Packer </strong> 1964 Gold in 800m, silver in 400m </p> <p> <strong> Derek Alhusen </strong> 1968 Three-day event team gold, individual silver </p> <p> <strong> David Wilkie </strong> 1976 gold 200m breaststroke, silver 100m breaststroke </p> <p> <strong> Seb Coe </strong> 1980 and 1984 Gold 1500m, silver 800m </p> <p> <strong> Jason Queally </strong> 2000 Kilo gold, team sprint silver </p> <p><strong> Leslie Law </strong> 2004 Three-day event individual gold and team silver</p>",

It's no idle boast, either - the world champion, born in Brooklyn but representing the Dominican Republic, is the best one-lap hurdler since Ed Moses and is unbeaten for three years. His primary challenge will come from the American champion James Carter, with the first two from Sydney, Angelo Taylor and Saudi Arabian Hadi Soua An Al Somaily, failing to qualify. </p> <p><strong> Brits in action</strong><br> </p> <p> American Dwight Phillips, the long jump world champion, was impressive in the heats, needing just the one jump to qualify in first place. But the 22-year-old <strong> Chris Tomlinson </strong> was only a smidgen behind and looks in the form of his life for the final (18.20). The 800m gold medallist <strong> Kelly Holmes</strong> , in her preferred event, should cruise through the 1500m semi-finals (18.30), while another big-time performer, <strong> Steve Backley</strong> , goes in javelin qualifying in a bid to add to his bronze from Barcelona and silvers from Atlanta and Sydney (18.25). </p> <p><strong> Simon Hiscocks </strong> and<strong> Chris Draper</strong> are in third place and are guaranteed at least a bronze medal in the final day of the 49ers.

  "<p>Yesterday was 10 minutes old when Yelena Isinbayeva poured liquid on to her palms, rubbed the grip of her vaulting pole and murmured her private litany for the last time. On this occasion, however, a broad smile had replaced the usual stare of ferocious concentration as she wiggled her bottom in that way she does before setting off down the runway. A few seconds later the stadium erupted to acclaim a new world record. </p> <p>It was a wonderful climax to an enthralling contest and around 25,000 people had remained in the Olympic stadium to watch it. A first-time inclusion four years ago in Sydney, the women's pole vault has become not just one of the glamour events but also one of the most rivetingly competitive. </p> <p>On Tuesday night the stadium had been full of marvellous examples of sporting fellowship. Best of all, perhaps, was the sight of the decathletes lying exhausted on the track after their 1500m races, then rising wearily to their feet to embrace each other with an unfeigned warmth, winners and losers indistinguishable from each other amid the collective goodwill generated by two dozen big men who had fought each other to a standstill. Then there was the beauty of the gesture extended by Bernard Lagat to Hicham El Guerrouj, the defeated Kenyan bending down to put his arm around the shoulder of the victorious Moroccan, who was kneeling on the track in disbelief and gratitude that finally, after so much misfortune, he had acquired the gold medal his glittering talent demanded. </p> <p>In the pole vault area, by contrast, fellowship was at a premium. Here was a high-stakes, high-risk, gloves-off, take-no-prisoners battle contested by a bunch of women who, as they lolled around waiting to take their turn, just happened to look like an audition for a Vogue cover shoot. </p> <p>The cast of Sydney's dramatic final has been replaced. Stacy Dragila, the winner four years ago, failed to qualify for the final. Tatiana Grigorieva, Australia's Russian ice queen, took her silver medal into retirement. But no one was missing them in Athens on Tuesday night as Anna Rogowska and Monika Pyrek of Poland, Thorey Edda Elisdottir of Iceland, Alejandra Garcia of Argentina, Silke Spiegelburg of Germany and the rest lined up to provide support to the featured attraction. </p> <p>This was, of course, the ongoing Russian civil war between Isinbayeva, a dark-haired, grey-eyed native of Volgograd, and Svetlana Feofanova, a freckled, sandy-haired Muscovite. And it is a contest that goes a lot deeper than the quest for a single Olympic gold medal. </p> <p>Isinbayeva is 22 and comes from a comfortable background. Feofanova, two years older, is the child of a single mother who worked at three jobs to keep the family fed. Both started as gymnasts and there was no love lost when they somersaulted on the balance beam and swung on the uneven bars. When they switched to the pole vault, their rivalry took on a new edge. \"Hi-and-goodbye\" is how Isinbayeva describes their relationship. </p> <p>At the beginning of this Olympic cycle Feofanova was the first to establish herself. With victories in the world outdoor and indoor championships last year she appeared to have manoeuvred herself into position for a gold medal in Athens. Isinbayeva had stalked her rival for a couple of seasons when she soared above her for the first time this year, setting a new world indoor record in Budapest and establishing a new outdoor mark of 4.87m in Gateshead. </p> <p>Feofanova reasserted her presence with a 4.88 in Heraklion, only to find Isinbayeva capturing a thrilling battle at Crystal Palace in July by lifting the record to 4.90. And there it stood until the first minutes of yesterday morning. </p> <p>The two Russians have clearly learnt a lesson from Sergey Bubka, the 1988 Olympic champion in the men's event. Having always resented the way the Soviet authorities pocketed his prize money, Bubka made sure, when it became possible for him to keep the bonuses on offer for setting a new world record, that he did so in increments of no more than one centimetre, in order to maximise his earnings. </p> <p>Currently the tariff for the women's pole vault record at grand prix meetings stands at $50,000, although a record set at an Olympics brings only a bonus from the athlete's shoe sponsor - which will probably at least match the missing official bonus. So when, having beaten Feofanova for the gold medal, Isinbayeva went for the record, it could be imagined that something more than extra entertainment for the crowd was in her mind. </p> <p>But who cared about the motives behind Isinbayeva's final flourish? What we got, as the night air bore the first cooling breeze of the week, was the sight of a woman pole-vaulting 4.91m for the first time in competition. </p> <p>One day Isinbayeva or Feofanova will clear 5m, the height at which Bubka said, long ago, that he would start to take women pole vaulters seriously. Isinbayeva says she has already done it in training, so it may not be too far away. Just do not expect to see it happen all at once.</p>",
  "<p>If you picture an Olympic team as athletes in tracksuits with a few blazer-clad types in the background to look after them, it is time for a rethink. </p> <p>Forty-five delegations here have more officials than athletes, according to figures issued by the Olympic organisers. Some countries have sent three or more \"blazers\" for every competitor. </p> <p>Even in teams in which athletes outnumber officials, it is often not by much. Only 61 of the 202 teams have two-thirds or more of their ranks filled with athletes. Team officials get free travel to Athens plus board in the Olympic village, paid for by the International Olympic Committee or the Greek organisers. </p> <p>Oman and East Timor are not prominent in the medals table but they can claim equal first in a different league - they have the highest \"blazer ratio\", or officials for every athlete, at 3.5. </p> <p>They are closely followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Panama and Ivory Coast, which have all sent more than twice as many officials as athletes. </p> <p>However, small countries argue the ratios can be misleading. They have only a few athletes good enough to qualify for the Olympics but any delegation needs a minimum of support staff, they say. </p> <p>\"It's very normal to bring this number of officials,\" said Mohammed Saad al Manwari, Oman's chef de mission. </p> <p>He said Oman had brought only two athletes, two coaches, a press officer, two national Olympic officials and himself. A Greek \"Olympic attach\u00e9\" had been provided by Games organisers. </p> <p>Other officials noted that the IOC stipulates the maximum size of a delegation. If a country has only a few world-class athletes, the rest of the team can be made up only by officials. </p> <p>\"The athletes qualify via their [international sports] federations,\" said Christophe Olela, chef de mission for the Democratic Republic of Congo. \"We had hoped more would qualify.\" </p> <p>The country has four competitors and 13 officials, according to the organisers' figures. </p> <p>Larger delegations may find it harder to justify their number of officials, a category that can include anyone from administrators and coaches to grooms. </p> <p>Ireland have 68 officials for only 46 athletes. Austria have 92 officials with their 74 competitors. </p> <p>Nigeria sent 85 athletes but nearly 100 officials to accompany them. </p> <p>Yet sporting superpowers the United States, Russia and China all achieve success with fewer than one official per athlete. </p> <p>Overall, 10,914 competitors and 7,668 team officials are registered, so non-athletes account for more than 40% of team membership, according to figures available on the Games' electronic information system. </p> <p><strong> Most blazers </strong></p> <p><strong> Vests Blazers Ratio </strong></p> <p> <strong> Oman</strong> 2 7 3.5 </p> <p><strong>Timor-Leste</strong> 2 7 3.5 </p> <p><strong>DR Congo</strong> 4 13 3.3 </p> <p><strong>Gabon</strong> 5 13 2.6 </p> <p><strong>Panama</strong> 4 10 2.5 </p> <p><strong>Ivory Coast</strong> 5 11 2.2 </p> <p><strong>Aruba</strong> 4 8 2 </p> <p><strong>Djibouti</strong> 1 2 2 </p> <p><strong>Senegal</strong> 17 32 1.88 </p> <p><strong>Afghanistan</strong> 5 9 1.8 </p> <p><strong>Bermuda</strong> 10 18 1.8 </p> <p><strong> Major nations </strong></p> <p> <strong>Vests Blazers Ratio </strong></p> <p> <strong> US</strong> 549 538 0.979 </p> <p><strong>Russia</strong> 458 351 0.766 </p> <p><strong>France</strong> 318 237 0.745 </p> <p><strong>Italy</strong> 377 280 0.742 </p> <p><strong>China</strong> 392 256 0.653 </p> <p><strong>Japan</strong> 322 209 0.649 </p> <p><strong>Romania</strong> 109 69 0.633 </p> <p><strong>Germany</strong> 462 277 0.599 </p> <p><strong>Ukraine</strong> 245 139 0.567 </p> <p><strong>Australia</strong> 490 236 0.481 </p> <p><strong>GB</strong> 270 116 0.429</p>",
  "<p>At Sydney four years ago it was impossible to move without being reminded of Marion Jones's \"Drive for Five\", the name her sponsors had given her audacious attempt to win a record five Olympic gold medals. There were billboards, magazine features, TV adverts, the lot. She was inescapable. </p> <p>She ultimately ended up with five medals but only three were gold, two bronze. Still, it consolidated her position as the sport's most marketable asset until her name became increasingly linked with investigations into banned performance-enhancing drugs.</p> <p>At these Olympics Jones has disappeared off the radar screen, having qualified only for the long jump. And, in truth, no one has missed her, such is the stigma attached to her now, even though she denies taking drugs and has not been charged by the United States Anti-Doping Agency.</p> <p>Jones looked pensive and apprehensive when she lined up for the long-jump qualifying last night. In contrast to 2000, there was no major introduction, merely a polite ripple of applause.</p> <p>Carolina Kluft, the 21-year-old Swede with the golden hair and the 200-megawatt smile, has replaced Jones as the sport's darling. Unlike Jones she did not seem to have a care in the world last night, having already won the heptathlon here, and her first effort of 6.78 metres took her to the final.</p> <p>On Jones's first jump she put her foot over the board earning a red flag. On her second she leapt from behind the board but still sailed out to 6.70m, 5cm beyond the automatic qualifying distance for the final tomorrow. Britain's Jade Johnson, who jumped 6.71m, will join her.</p> <p>\"I'm excited to be back on the track,\" said Jones. \"It was difficult for me, the past few days, watching the finals. Now I've made it to the final.\"</p> <p>Jones is clearly determined not to buckle under the pressure she must be feeling and hopes to challenge for at least one more medal on Saturday. She has been practising with other members of the relay squad at the US pre-Olympic training camp in Crete in the hope of being selected for the 4x100m and 4x400m.</p> <p>Some squad members, however, most notably the 1992 and 1996 Olympic 100m champion Gail Devers, do not want her on the team. They fear that, if Jones is subsequently charged by Usada and found to have committed a doping offence, any medals won will be taken away by the International Olympic Committee.</p> <p>Britain's sprinters sadly fulfilled gloomy prophecy. Having failed to get anyone to the 100m final for the first time since 1976, they did the same at 200m, Darren Campbell and Christian Malcolm going out in the semi- finals.</p> <p>Campbell, the 2000 Olympic silver medallist, was hampered by a hamstring injury and finished last in 20.89sec before slumping to the track in a mix of agony and disappointment.</p> <p>Later he let rip at the BBC's television pundits Colin Jackson and Michael Johnson. \"I am not a quitter,\" he said. \"To be ridiculed like that is disgraceful. I tore my hamstring but I don't know how to give up. If they want to see the scans they can. I could have walked away but I don't know how to do that.</p> <p>\"I have been having treatment from 8.30am until 12.30am just to get me on the track and it is only thanks to the medical team that I was out there today. I was hoping this would be my last championships but after a bad games I can't leave it like this. I'm going to have to rethink and come back in four years.\"</p> <p>Malcolm went in the second semi but he too felt the effects of his kidney failure a fortnight ago and finished seventh in 20.77 seconds.</p> <p>Justin Gatlin, the American winner of the 100m, remained on course to become the first man to complete the double since Carl Lewis 20 years ago as he qualified easily for the final tonight.</p> <p>But the Olympic career of Allen Johnson almost certainly ended at 33 when he crashed into the ninth barrier in the 110m hurdles semi-final and fell over and out.</p> <p>Hicham El Guerrouj allowed himself precious little time to let being Olympic 1500m champion sink in. Less than 24 hours after winning one of the greatest races the sport has seen on Tuesday he lined up for the 5,000m.</p> <p>The Moroccan qualified easily for the final on Saturday, where he will be trying to become the first man since Paavo Nurmi 80 years ago to complete the Olympic 1500-5,000m double.</p>",
  "<p>A new generation of Cuban baseball stars beat Australia to win the gold medal last night, a performance that restored their country's reputation as the pre-eminent power in Olympic baseball and, if past history is anything to go by, promised to add a little extra drama to the head count when the squad arrives at Athens airport later this week to catch the plane back home to Havana. </p> <p>Defections rather than opposition pitchers with nasty curve balls have been the bane of Cuban baseball down the years, so much so - it was reported in the American media - that before the squad left for Greece they had a ceremony during which the players swore an oath to \"fight for victory with dignity, patriotism and simplicity\" and to \"stand up for Cuban principles\". </p> <p>Nationalistic team bonding is hardly unusual in the context of an Olympic games. Yet when Cubans indulge in such behaviour suddenly get-togethers become \"ceremonies\" and promises become \"oaths\", as if there is some kind sinister compunction involved. It could be that the Cuban players are being forced to play a sport they love, in the colours of the country they grew up in, but it certainly has not looked that way at this tournament, during which an inexperienced squad has played with enthusiasm and spirit, losing only one of their nine games. </p> <p>Indeed, let the record show that when the Cuban starting pitcher Norge Vera sat down the first eight Australian batters without giving up a single hit, he did so without a gun to his head; that when centre fielder Ariel Pestano nearly broke his neck against the outfield wall preventing a certain two-run double in the third inning, he was not under orders from Fidel Castro; and when left-fielder Frederich Cepeda crashed a home run halfway towards Crete in the fourth innings he did not follow the ball over the wall and seek a new and better future in capitalist Brigadoon. </p> <p>Cepeda's homer gave his team a two-run lead. Australia replied with a run in the fifth. But then Eriel Sanchez's two-run single at the top of the sixth gave Cuba a 4-1 advantage, a lead that was then stretched to a comfortable 6-2. </p> <p>Sanchez and Cepeda were the heroes on the night but neither man is likely to attract the attention of the American scouts who follow the Cuban team wherever it plays. Second-baseman Yulieski Gourriel, athletic, strong and still only 19, and Ariel Pestano, who has topped the batting averages in Athens, are both considered to be good enough for Major League baseball. Whether or not either man would ever want to leave his homeland is another matter. </p> <p>\"Our players were free to come and go as they pleased during all the time they've spent in Athens,\" the Cuban coach Higinio Velez said last week, irked when the issue of defections was raised. </p> <p>Maybe so. But the team Velez brought here was not his strongest. Last December his best player, first baseman Kendry Morales and his first-choice catcher, Barbaro Canizares, were arrested by Cuban police for their involvement in a plan to sail from Caibarien, in the north of Cuba, to the Bahamas. Both were thrown out of the game. Not only that, Morales's record-setting first year as a batter in the league has been expunged from the records. \"They betrayed the love of the Cuban people,\" explained. Carlos Rodriguez, commissioner of Cuba's national baseball league at the time. </p> <p>That being the case, the Cuban people must be carrying a persecution complex by now. </p> <p>Since 1990, an estimated 50 elite players have left, most for the United States. One of them, pitcher Livan Hernadez, now with the Montreal Expos, was even voted most valuable player when his then club, the Florida Marlins, won the World Series in 1997. Hernadez's brother, Orlando \"El Duque\" was involved in the most dramatic defection of all, when he, his wife and six friends were washed up on an island off the Bahamas. El Duque was offered \"humanitarian parole\" by the US government, followed by a tasty contract from the New York Yankees. </p> <p>Major league money, especially when measured against the relative poverty most Cubans live in, is an obvious motiviation for players to defect. Yet the players also find themselves subjected to intense pressure from US-based agents keen to cash in on their talents but uninterested in their personal circumstances. </p> <p>In 2002, Jose Contreras, a pitcher who had starred for Cuba in Sydney, walked out on the team during a tournament in Mexico. Like El Duque, he and his new agent ended up in the offices of the Yankees, where he signed a $38m (\u00a321m) contract. Great things were expected of Contreras but, separated from his wife and children who remained in Cuba, he delivered little and was traded by New York after just one season.</p>",
  "He is sitting down when I enter the echoing, well-used function room in the Brixton Recreation Centre, so for the moment I am taking it on faith that Luol Deng is 6ft 8in, with a wingspan - lovely concept, that - of 7ft. A handshake, a wary look, though I don't see what I and my tape recorder can do to him: throughout the interview there will be five or six other men in the room, vigilant and protective as UN observers. <p>Only in basketball would Deng be called a small forward. He is such a good small forward, however, that he has just been signed by the Chicago Bulls for $6.3m over three years. Apparently, the Bulls aren't at their strongest, past the heyday when Michael Jordan ensured that even those who knew nothing about basketball knew the Bulls, but they are still a big deal, and so, suddenly, is Deng. Hence the posse, the 15 minutes of face time I'm told I'll be permitted, and the anxious PR man for PlayStation buzzing around saying, \"You will mention PlayStation 2, won't you? Won't you?\" </p> <p>But this is also the gym in which Deng has trained for seven years, ever since coming to Britain in 1994 (and PlayStation 2 sponsors Hosana, an organisation that supports grassroots basketball throughout the UK). This, Deng says, is home, and the observers are two brothers, a couple of guys from Hosana and his childhood coach, Jimmy Rogers, who still teaches the youth of Brixton the joys of bouncing balls. So it is starry and entirely unstarry at the same time, a shambolic collision of NBA control and simple Brixton mess. </p> <p>In previous interviews, Deng has referred to his family's move from Sudan, via Egypt, as \"a tough journey that has helped me mature that much quicker\" to seeing \"things that a lot of adults have never seen and never will\". But when I ask what he means, specifics elude him. \"I left Sudan at a very young age, so I don't really remember much.\" Six years' training in the US has given him a languid American accent. What was life like in Sudan? \"To be honest ... \" He laughs, rather engagingly at a loss, and I'm reminded that despite the poise, and watchfulness, he is only 19. \"I can't ... \" </p> <p>Luol's father, Aldo Deng, later fills in the gaps. The Dengs - Luol is the eighth of nine children, Aldo has two other wives and a total of 16 offspring - were a wealthy landowning family (\"We had farms, cars, houses\"). Aldo was elected to parliament in 1967, and by 1989 had served as a provincial governor, as deputy speaker (twice), as a minister of culture, of irrigation, of transport, and as deputy prime minister. But they are also Dinka, a southern Sudanese Christian tribe notable for its height, but known mainly in the west for its misfortunes: women and children sold into slavery in Sudan are frequently Dinka. </p> <p>In 1989, the elected government was overthrown and Sharia law imposed. Aldo Deng was imprisoned for three months, then released on condition that he negotiate peace between the Christian south and the Muslim north. That year, when Luol was four, he took the precaution of sending his family to Alexandria. On December 15, 1993, on the pretext of a holiday, Aldo left Khartoum for London; the following month, he claimed political asylum. </p> <p>Luol is a bit hazy about Egypt, too. Did they live in a refugee camp? \"We were refugees, but I never really went to a refugee camp,\" then, \"not basketball, or any other refugee camp.\" All the same, in Alexandria they were so poor that the Catholic church had to come to their rescue with food; the Egyptian government provided free education. </p> <p>What would have become of them if they hadn't left? \"The lucky ones would have gone into the army. Others might have died. They would have been mistreated because of my name. So many relatives, so many supporters, have died because of my name.\" </p> <p>Another brother shambles in, sits down next to Luol, introduces himself as Ajou, \"the tallest one\". And how tall is that? \"6ft 11in\". Four of Luol's siblings play competitive basketball; Ajou, injured a year ago, used to play for the universities of Connecticut and Fairfield, and wants to turn professional; Akuei used to play for Brixton Top Cats; sister Arek, plays for Delaware University; Deng Deng plays for Plymouth. </p> <p>The family was aided by the appearance one summer of NBA star Manute Bol; a 7ft 7in Dinka who ploughed much of his accrued millions back into charitable causes back home, as well as into the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). On holiday in Alexandria, Bol saw the brothers knocking a ball about, taught them some rules and became a family friend. </p> <p>In time the children joined Aldo, and the family has lived ever since in refugee housing in south London on income support, augmented latterly by what the now-grown children earn. \"Our family has been supported by British taxation,\" says Aldo Deng. \"All my children have finished university and even I got involved in studying. We are very grateful. We are not like other refugees who don't remember.\" </p> <p>They spoke Arabic and Dinka, but initially no English; at home They \"mix it up,\" says Luol with a mischievous grin. \"You gotta be one of the family to understand what we're saying, but mostly we speak Dinka.\" </p> <p>Basketball in Brixton provided a way of belonging. \"You don't need to speak the language,\" says Ajou. \"Basketball got us a long way. It gave us education.\" By the time he was 13, Luol had been asked to play for England's 15-and-under teams in both football and basketball. Reluctantly, realising he was too tall, \"except if I wanted to be a goalie or something\", he relinquished football, and later led England to the finals of the European junior tournament in basketball in Poland. Arek has also played for England. </p> <p>But the only place for an ambitious basketball player to go is America, and both Luol and his sister won scholarships to the Blair Academy in New Jersey, where he was bitterly homesick. By the time he graduated he was ranked second-best high-school player in the country. Recruiters were so keen to sign him up he once even found one lying in wait for him when he came out of the shower. </p> <p>He lasted only a year at Duke University before entering his name for the NBA draft. This did not make him popular with Duke fans: online message boards are rife with accusations of betrayal and money-grubbing. \"Most kids go to school to find a job to eventually support their family, and support themselves,\" says Luol. \"I put myself in that position in one year, so there's really no need to stay the next three years.\" He does promise that he will get around to graduating at some point. </p> <p>What, particularly, would have prompted the Bulls to pick him? \"If you're just good at one thing you're not really a basketball player,\" he says. \"I can't really tell you one particular thing.\" \"He's very talented,\" offers Anjou, \"but everyone in college basketball is talented. To be better than everybody you have to work hard. That's what he does. He works hard.\" </p> <p>They are all proud of him, says Luol, \"but in the family you still get treated the same - as soon as you walk in the door you're still the same kid and if you're messing up, your mom is still going to get on you, but when you gotta walk outside the door, and you see your fans and stuff, it's this kind of different world.\" So he has a lot of fans? \"Yeah. So I try to stay indoors with my family.\" </p> <p>At the moment, both brothers are jumping through the hoops necessary to get British passports - they would love to play for England in the Commonwealth games in 2006, and in the next Olympics. It also means, says Aldo, that Luol will pay taxes to Britain, and not the States (Luol has apparently refused a green card): \"This is the country that rescued us from the most difficult country in Africa,\" he says; they want to pay something back. The Dengs will at last be able to stop claiming income support, and - though I'm not sure how Luol feels about this - his father hopes he will buy a small shop, to give his other relatives something to do. </p> <p>And finally, there is Sudan. Ever since he arrived in England, Aldo Deng has, he says, been working to help southern Sudan: he has chaired various charities and reports on human rights for the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement; he has set up the Deng International Foundation to support children, women, schools and healthcare; recently, he has been among those attempting to warn about the severity of what is happening in Darfur. Eastern Africa is a prime training ground for terrorists, he points out, and some are among the Janjaweed. His most famous son also feels a sense of duty: \"I'm in a position financially where I could build something or support a kid [in Sudan]. It's not something I would do just because people expect me to. I believe that I can make a difference.\" </p> <p>Finally, he is dragged off for a photo shoot with some children at a basketball camp, some of whom, swamped in their strip, barely reach his knees. Far above his head, on the walls of the gym that made him a player, are encouraging slogans. Rough and Ready. Hoop Dreams Reality. Respect Given.</p>",
  "<p>Although the headlines have naturally gone to his team-mate Ian Bell, the 23-year-old Jonathan Trott, a South African in the process of qualifying for England, has played a crucial role in Warwickshire's success. </p> <p>He yesterday passed 1,000 runs for the season at an average of 59. He is a compact and cultured right-hander and his stand of 99 with the wicket-keeper Tony Frost formed the only significant resistance to the Sussex bowlers. </p> <p>Either side of this partnership, it was the visitors' day as they whittled away at the Warwickshire wickets before posting a substantial opening stand of their own. Grateful for a day only briefly interrupted by a lunchtime shower, Sussex were anxious to make brisk progress in their attempt to climb to a safe perch in the table. </p> <p>The bouncy pace of Robin Martin-Jenkins was particularly effective and he eventually accounted for Trott. The batsman was baffled by one that seamed, clipped his pads and bowled him through the gate. </p> <p>Bell, who resumed his innings knowing that he will winter as an Academy player rather than a county Test star, added only three singles to his overnight 84 before, in a rare misjudgment, he left alone a ball from James Kirtley that just trimmed his bails. Mike Powell, Jim Troughton and Dougie Brown then formed a procession back to the pavilion, and Sussex moved into control. </p> <p>The introduction of a new ball after lunch did not disturb Trott and Frost but when Mushtaq Ahmed began to whirl from the pavilion end he deceived Frost with his flipper, and Trott soon followed. </p> <p>Heath Streak prodded defensively at Martin-Jenkins and stood his ground, perhaps convinced the ball had been caught on the half-volley by Murray Goodwin in the slip cordon, before reluctantly departing, and despite some entertaining fast-bowler's smiting by Dewald Pretorius, Warwickshire were denied a fourth batting point. </p> <p>Ian Ward was another batsman to surpass 1,000 yesterday, reaching the mark in style by hooking Naqaash Tahir into the Eric Hollies stand. However, it was his opening partner, Richard Montgomerie, who was the driving force in a stand of 106. When Montgomerie drove Brown to the mid-wicket boundary he went to 52 in 45 balls, including 11 boundaries to all parts. </p> <p>He survives into this morning, though Ward fell leg-before, yorked on the boot by Tahir. Both sides will have scanned the weather forecast this morning but Sussex, in particular, need fair weather, while a handful of bonus points and a draw would be enough to consolidate Warwickshire's position.</p>"
