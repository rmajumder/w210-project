  "<p><strong> Herald</strong><br> Editorial, Scotland, October 8  </p> <p>\"It is a judgment that would have tested the wisdom of King Solomon himself ... With doctors and her parents unable to agree on whether [Charlotte Wyatt] should be resuscitated the next time she stops breathing, Mr Justice Hedley was required to play God. Few would envy his task. Born at 26 weeks, weighing one pound, 11-month-old Charlotte suffers from serious heart and respiratory problems and has already stopped breathing three times. She is deaf and blind and has serious brain damage ... Her parents ... have clung to the most fragile of hopes that with a bit more help from God and medical technology, she could one day go outside to feel the breeze on her cheek and go home to her loving family ... </p> <p>\"It is hard to argue that a baby with no hope of a future should be subjected to further suffering. In this respect, evidence from the Wyatts' own expert witness that a further lengthy spell on a ventilator would be 'cruel and invasive', may have decided the case. This was a difficult judgment but a wise and compassionate one.\" </p> <p><strong> Sun</strong><br> Editorial, October 8  </p> <p>\"Her parents have quite properly and understandably done all they can to prolong her life. But the courts are right to recognise that, however heartbreaking it may seem, such action may not be in the best interests of Charlotte. Doctors and nurses will undoubtedly do their very best for Charlotte, but we all must recognise there are limits to what medicine can do.\" </p> <p><strong> Daily Mirror</strong><br> Editorial, October 8 </p> <p>\"There was never going to be a winner or loser. Whatever the judge decided, Charlotte Wyatt was going to die ... It was the most difficult decision for a judge to take, but ultimately he took the one which was best for Charlotte. Her life would be short in any case and lived in constant pain. Her parents wanted her to have every chance to live, but the sad truth is that she doesn't have any chance of surviving. She has only lived this long thanks to the amazing skills of her doctors and the incredible care she has received ... </p> <p>\"The agony of Charlotte's father and mother must be terrible to bear. But the judge has made the right decision. Because it is the right one for Charlotte.\" </p> <p><strong> Independent</strong><br> Editorial, October 8 </p> <p>\"It was a case in which several important strands of modern life came together: the continuing advance of medical technology, the greater awareness of individuals in this country about their rights under the law, and our more demanding and informed approach to public services. </p> <p>\"There was a time when Charlotte would not have survived long beyond birth. There was a time, too, when even if she had survived in her current, damaged, condition, a doctor might have quietly performed what he or she would doubtless have regarded as a merciful act. The doctors would not have considered Charlotte's future a dilemma. Her parents would have been either grateful or none the wiser. </p> <p>\"Those were simpler times. Progress has made for many complications, some of them welcome, some not. This was a clear and well-founded ruling in an exceptionally difficult case, and for that we should all be grateful. But it must not serve as too wide a precedent.\" </p> <p><strong> Times </strong><br> Editorial, October 8  </p> <p>\"Mr Justice Hedley should ... be afforded sympathy for his difficult circumstances, although his decision was wrong ... The judiciary is entitled to intervene on behalf of a child when it can be claimed that parents are being negligent in not pursuing a course of action that might save the life of their offspring ... But to claim that parents might be negligent in seeking to preserve a life presents a much lesser case for judicial intervention. It would be necessary to show that such an ambition bordered on the sadistic. This is not an assertion that can yet be made here. </p> <p>\"The law on life is the loser. The strong legal presumption in favour of life set out some 10 weeks ago by Mr Justice Mumby in the case of Leslie Burke now appears to be less certain. Charlotte's suffering may soon, mercifully, be over. The legal impact of her short life and plight will continue.\" </p> <p><strong> Tom Utley</strong><br> Daily Telegraph, October 8 </p> <p>\"The moment when the law becomes involved in an agonisingly difficult decision like this is the moment when it affects every one of us. I see great dangers in the judge's decision to overrule Charlotte's parents and allow her doctors to let her die. Rightly or wrongly, it will be seen to have established the principle in English law that some lives are worth saving, and others aren't. </p> <p>\"However carefully Mr Justice Hedley might have qualified his judgment, insisting that it applied only to Charlotte's particular case, the damage has been done. The idea has been sown in the minds of money-conscious NHS trusts that it is up to them to decide who should live or die, according to a doctor's assessment of his patient's 'quality of life' ... </p> <p>\"I realise that there is an important distinction between allowing doctors to kill their patients and merely permitting them not to revive them. But it is a slippery slope that we are treading. I wish that Mr Justice Hedley had opted for life.\"</p>",
  "<p>The village of Brockenhurst in the New Forest is only an hour and a half from London, but it might as well be in another world. </p> <p>While it is impossible to walk through the capital without seeing a black or Asian face, take a train south-west from Waterloo and the last black face you are likely to see is the person picking up the rubbish on the train. </p> <p>Trevor Phillips, the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, spoke yesterday of \"passive apartheid\" in the countryside, for which a kind of \"mutual incomprehension\" was to blame. </p> <p>He told the BBC: \"This is not by anybody's will; there is no law and I doubt if anybody in the countryside wants to keep people out. But I think what we are seeing is a gradual drift towards a difficult situation in which people from ethnic minorities feel uncomfortable.\" </p> <p>Few people in Brockenhurst disagreed that a black face on the high street was something of a novelty. </p> <p>\"We don't see many,\" said Julia Timms from the Village Butchers. \"If you do see one you do notice. You don't treat them any differently, but they do stand out.\" </p> <p>Jean-Marc Charton, who runs the French Confection teashop, said: \"I've been here for 10 years and if I've seen four coloured people in a year I would be surprised. </p> <p>\"You see people who come to do cleaning jobs or to work in the nursing home, but they only come from Southampton for the day.\" </p> <p>Most were at pains to point out that \"coloured\" people would not be unwelcome, but a few voices were inclined to agree with Mr Phillips. </p> <p>\"In a small community like this they can be very closed,\" said Sue Boldrini, who works in the village opticians. </p> <p>\"My husband is Italian and I had one or two friends who felt he shouldn't be doing this or doing that because he wasn't born here. </p> <p>\"I just pointed out that he was paying his taxes like anyone else and could do what he liked. But I guess it is even worse for coloured people: people don't see beyond colour.\" </p> <p>Chris Dunkinson, 23, an American who visits relatives in the village, said: \"Older people are very open-minded here but the teenagers are not. They take the piss out of me because I am American. </p> <p>\"The other night someone's cell phone went missing in the pub and they automatically thought it was me. I dread to think of their reaction if I was black.\" </p> <p>Brockenhurst is in Hampshire, where 98.6% of the population is white, and is precisely the kind of village that Mr Phillips had in his sights when he argued yesterday that more needed to be done to encourage ethnic minorities to venture out of the cities. </p> <p>Research shows that only one person in 85 in the south-west is black or Asian, compared with a national average of about one in 12. </p> <p>A survey by the UK National Tourist Board in 2002-03 showed that 1% of day trippers to the countryside were of ethnic minority origin, compared with 9% of the population. </p> <p>Although it is clear that much of the discomfort felt by black and Asian people when contemplating visiting or living in the country stems from an exaggerated fear of hostility, there is more to it. </p> <p>If you are black, trying to get a decent haircut, buy appropriate cosmetics or find a plantain is difficult outside the main British cities </p> <p>It is also a matter of stereotypes. How many images of black or Asian people walking up a windswept mountain or contemplating the sea from a Cornish beach do you see on television or in advertising? The very word \"urban\" seems to have become a euphemism for black. </p> <p>It is this stereotyping that Jacqui Stearn from the Countryside Agency hopes to counteract. \"Quite frankly our sector have got a lot to learn from what's happening in other sectors,\" she said. </p> <p>\"Most of the material features white, middle-class people. We need to stop worrying about being seen as politically correct or getting things wrong and reach out to other people.\" </p> <p>The handful of people from ethnic minorities who have made their home in Brockenhurst insisted they had received nothing but welcome. </p> <p>Pauline Soma, a retired teacher who has lived there with her husband, Jasmat, originally from South Africa, said: \"I was a little bit angry about what Trevor Phillips said. I thought he went too far. </p> <p>\"I don't know whether he has been to rural communities and asked people but I certainly don't think they are racist. They just don't meet people from other cultures.\" </p> <p>Mr Soma agreed: \"I don't think it's racism that stops people coming to the country. I had more racism from pupils ... in London than I have here. </p> <p>\"It's more about culture and tradition. A lot of Asians want to go back to the country they came from rather than go on holiday in the English countryside.\" </p> <p>Ehsan Zaman, from Bangladesh, is working as a waiter at the only Indian restaurant in Brockenhurst while he waits to begin his Masters in corporate risk at the University of Southampton. He insisted he had experienced only goodwill in his six months in the village. </p> <p>\"I love the countryside,\" he said. \"People here are special people. They talk very nicely. When I go to the cities I do face problems, I have been called names and felt threatened. But here the people are very, very good.</p>",
  "<p>A project to assess the world's ecosystems has found that the widespread use of fertilisers and the burning of fossil fuels will severely damage life in lakes and rivers around the globe. </p> <p>The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, launched by the World Bank in Washington in 2001, examines how any disruption to the environment, whether by human action or natural events, will harm human health, food production and natural resources. </p> <p>Scientists have spent the past three years piecing together data from thousands of studies. Their official report will be published early next year, but a first draft shows a number of alarming trends. </p> <p>A major concern is the increase in nitrogen emissions because of fertiliser use and the burning of fossil fuels. </p> <p>\"In the past 100 years, emissions have risen from around 20m tonnes a year to more than 150m tonnes a year,\" said Robert Watson, the project leader and the World Bank's chief scientist. \"We're emitting more than seven times more nitrogen and that is going to have incredible implications for ecological systems.\" </p> <p>As an ingredient in fertiliser, nitrogen helps to feed some 2 billion people. But when it is washed from soils into water courses it can make rivers and lakes too rich in nutrients. </p> <p>As a result, algae and other life can grow out of control, eventually stripping oxygen from the water which fish and other aquatic life need. </p> <p>Dead zones have already begun to appear, notably in the Gulf of Mexico, which is fed by nitrogen-rich water from the Mississippi river. \"We are looking at major effects in the US, Europe and south-east Asia,\" Dr Watson said. </p> <p>As the world's population is estimated to grow to 9 billion in 40 years, food production is expected to become more intensive, requiring ever more nitrogen-rich fertiliser. </p> <p>Kenneth Cassman, an expert on environmental health at the University of Nebraska, said the efficiency of nitrogen use needed to be \"massively improved\". \"There are a number among us who think this is more important than carbon emissions, in terms of environmental impact,\" he said. </p> <p>In a separate part of the study, the scientists found that global warming would severely disrupt ecosystems, especially in the developing world, if it was not kept in check. An increase of more than 2C (3.6F) would be enough to severely degrade the availability of food, water and human health in developing countries. </p> <p>Dr Watson, who worked as a scientific adviser to the White House during the Clinton administration, said that while the final report would describe different ways the problems might be dealt with, it was up to governments and private companies to collaborate. </p> <p>\"We can move in a direction where we destroy our natural heritage or we can move in a direction where we improve both human wellbeing and maintain our natural heritage,\" he said. \"We've got choices and we have to decide which future we want.\"</p>",
  "<p>Diageo is pressing the government to launch a multi-million pound anti binge-drinking campaign, using the same shock tactics as the hard-hitting drink-drive adverts. </p> <p>The drinks group - whose brands include youth favourites such as Smirnoff Ice, Archers Aqua and Bailey's Glide - has held high level meetings with the Downing Street strategy unit and at the Department of Health to persuade the government to back a campaign. </p> <p>Diageo's advertising agency - Abbott Mead Vickers - has been working on ideas for an issue-based campaign which the government could adopt. AMV has suggested targeting an initial campaign at young women drinkers focusing on their lack of control and vulnerability after binge-drinking. The agency wants to use hard-hitting tactics and shock imagery to get the message across. </p> <p>Another meeting with government is planned. Kate Blakeley, head of social responsibility at Diageo said: \"We want to make binge drinking as socially unacceptable as drink-driving\". Ms Blakeley said Diageo took its responsibility for promoting sensible drinking \"very seriously\", but binge-drinking, along with underage and drink-driving, was a problem for government. </p> <p>She said Diageo would like to see a \"sustained\" anti-binge drinking campaign, modelled on the drink-drive adverts which, although they have been criticised for their shock imagery, are credited with changing public attitudes. </p> <p>As a result of its impact on health and crime, binge-drinking has already become a political issue. </p> <p>Tony Blair waded into the debate this year when he addressed a \"responsible drinking forum\" organised by the Institute of Public Policy Research. The forum - hosted by Diageo - was attended by home office minister Hazel Blears, public health minister Melanie Johnson together with representatives from the police and alcohol treatment services. Mr Blair told the industry binge drinking was in danger of becoming \"the new British disease\". </p> <p>Diageo's efforts to seize the initiative in talks with government have only served to anger other industry players. Several of Britain's largest brewers and pub operators tore up invitations to the IPPR meeting. </p> <p>They are keen for the industry to maintain a united position through the Portman Group and the British Beer &amp; Pub Association. </p> <p>Some drinks groups - particularly those with profits from premium brands to protect, like Diageo - are nevertheless concerned that these industry-funded trade groups are not moving fast enough to meet the growing problem. </p> <p>They fear that the relaxation of licensing laws next year, which will allow bars to stay open for longer hours, is likely to exacerbate the problem and that unless action is taken the problem will backfire on them and, ultimately, their profits. </p> <p>But many struggling high street bar operators have more immediate concerns. They are locked in a price war as they fight for limited custom in an overcrowded market. </p> <p>The resulting happy hour promotions and price cuts have been condemned by politicians, police and health authorities, but few operators have paid heed. </p> <p>The drinks industry funds The Portman Group to act as an independent lobby group to promote responsible drinking, but there is understood to be concern among the biggest drinks companies about the progress it is making.</p>",
  "<p>One month short of his 34th birthday and 13 years after he made his Wales debut against Brazil, Mark Pembridge will today win his 54th cap charged with the task of being Wayne Rooney's chaperone. </p> <p>That, it appears, is how Mark Hughes intends to combat the threat of the \u00a327m Manchester United 18-year-old as Rooney sits behind England's striking partnership of Michael Owen and Jermain Defoe. </p> <p>It is a task Pembridge is more qualified than most to undertake. Until his recent move to Fulham Pembridge was a club-mate of Rooney's at Everton. Pembridge therefore knows Rooney very well, having trained with the teenager every day and sat beside him on the bench the day Rooney was first called into the Everton squad aged 16. </p> <p>Neither Hughes nor Pembridge would be drawn on the details of Wales's tactics, but Hughes has to nullify the threat of Rooney as England seek to exploit what is regarded as the soft centre of the Wales defence. </p> <p>Playing in front of West Ham's Andy Melville and Cardiff City's Danny Gabbidon, Pembridge will offer extra defensive cover as Wales do all they can to condense the game. </p> <p>According to Hughes yesterday, this will be particularly vital during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Hughes does not want a repeat of the recent Northern Ireland game, when Wales were 2-0 down in 20 minutes and all plans were redundant. </p> <p>While saying that Wales cannot get \"wrapped up\" over one individual, Hughes made plain his admiration for Rooney. </p> <p>\"Taking my Wales hat off I really enjoy watching him play. He's an explosive talent. He seems to be dealing with the expectation and he's a joy to watch.\" </p> <p>Hughes has been a safety-first manager in his five years with Wales, understandably given the personnel available, and his priority this afternoon will be not to lose. </p> <p>That would set up Wales for next Wednesday's qualifier with Poland in Cardiff, but a victory that echoed the last meeting between the two countries, in 1984 when Hughes scored the winner on his debut, is also in the thoughts. For that to happen Hughes said all his players would have to be at their peak and he expressed the hope that Ryan Giggs, on his home ground and against his friend and United team-mate Gary Neville, will have one of those games where he is \"unplayable\". </p> <p>\"It's a big stage and Ryan is a world-class performer. Sometimes when you have players who know each other they cancel each other out. But sometimes Ryan is unplayable.\" </p> <p>Hughes, of course, was also a United star. He said that the night the club collected their first title under Sir Alex Ferguson in 1993 was his greatest memory. He also admitted that on occasion he went too far with his challenges but he said he will try and stress to his players the benefit of a cool head today. </p> <p>\"The danger is emotionally and physically you expend too much. Players who know each other can take certain issues into a game and that can cloud the mix.\" </p> <p>It is up to Hughes to plot a way through that in his penultimate game in charge. In his hotel last night, where every room has a different theme, he will have noted that the name on the door is Sherlock Holmes.</p>",
  "<p>England's road to the 2006 World Cup cuts through the past this afternoon. That diversion is a scenic route, with views of an ancient football landscape. Important as any fixture inherently is in this tournament, the qualifier with Wales at Old Trafford offers additional prizes. These are particularly attractive to the visitors and, in that regard, Sven-Goran Eriksson's team are at a disadvantage. </p> <p>Wales could wrestle from the day a tale that they will rejoice in recounting for decades to come. For England it would be undignified to gloat over a win against a smaller nation. This might feel just like a business matter for them as they set off to bank another three points in the Group Six account. </p> <p>If minds are dulled by the assumption that this is a routine task, England will be vulnerable. \"I hope we are as up for it as Wales are,\" said Eriksson. \"If we are not, the risk is very big that we will not win the game. So, of course we have to stand up and make tackles and take tackles. You will not win games even with the best 11 in the world if you don't fight.\" </p> <p>An outsider will feel like an anthropologist as he considers this contest. Stretching for an analogy, Eriksson compares it to meetings between Sweden and Norway, but he realises that the match with Wales is even more distinctive. \"It's a strange situation,\" he said. \"You are playing against almost-countrymen.\" </p> <p>It is that blend of intimacy and enmity that characterises the encounter. As soon as the sides collided in the World Cup draw, talk turned to the previous clash, 20 years ago, when Wales won 1-0. In truth, the Home International series of which people now speak so sentimentally had long since gone to seed, afflicted by weak team selections and sickly attendances. </p> <p>Today's game is a much greater event. There is a real reward at stake and ambitions have been honed, in Wales at least, during the wait for renewed rivalry. </p> <p>Followers of Mark Hughes' team will galvanise themselves by supposing that they are being patronised. They would enjoy unearthing hidden disparagement in comments from Eriksson that were purely factual. </p> <p>\"If you look at the size of the countries and the number of people England has playing football in comparison to Wales,\" he said, \"England is the big brother. I didn't mean we were much better than Wales. But, when you talk about England and Wales, England will always be the big brother, whether it's in football or anything else.\" </p> <p>Eriksson is full of praise for Wales and speaks with concern, for instance, of the pace of Ryan Giggs and Craig Bellamy. In practice, though, his side should win efficiently and tighten their grip on Group Six. The likeliest rivals, Austria and Poland, have still to come to these shores to meet England. </p> <p>There continue to be indications that England will, in effect, field three forwards, with Wayne Rooney margin ally adrift of Michael Owen and Jermain Defoe. Eriksson has begun with an attacking trident before at Old Trafford, but that was merely against Liechtenstein. He protests, in any case, that such a method is not against his nature. </p> <p>Eriksson has recollections of winning Serie A in 2000 with a Lazio side that enjoyed an undefeated run of 17 matches while often using Roberto Mancini behind a pair of strikers. It is relevant, too, that Wales were crushed 4-0 by Italy in Milan last year when the hat-trick scorer Filippo Inzaghi was abetted by both Christian Vieri and Alessandro Del Piero. </p> <p>The England manager may hesitate only because there are reservations over all three of his attackers. Eriksson supposes that not even the prospect of a World Cup final itself would perturb Rooney, but one might still ask whether a lack of match fitness could hamper him. </p> <p>The euphoria of his Manchester United debut brought a hat-trick against Fenerbah\u00e7e but Middlesbrough's George Boateng shackled him in a 1-1 draw five days later. Wales will detail someone like Mark Pembridge to be his jailer. </p> <p>Defoe, with one start for England, is inexperienced while Owen, well versed as he is in international football, is out of form and usually out of the team at Real Madrid. \"It's not a concern today,\" Eriksson said of his vice-captain, \"but it might be at Christmas-time. I am sure he wants to show [people what he can do] and this is a very good opportunity for him, if he plays.\" </p> <p>For the most part England are on the upswing, glad that Sol Campbell is available once more and amazed at Rio Ferdinand's condition after his eight-month ban. In a match that will contain rough patches Eriksson hopes that the Norwegian referee Terje Hauge will not bridle at strong tackles. Yet England do not need to look solely to an official's temperament to save David Beckham and Owen from the booking that will bring a suspension. </p> <p>England should hope instead to tame the action by outplaying Wales. Draws with Azerbaijan and Northern Ireland do suggest that Hughes's side are short of the standards they set in the home win over Italy during the Euro 2004 qualifiers. </p> <p>If they control Wales, England will be in command of Group Six.</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid to Frank Lampard is that it is beginning to feel like a trick of the mind that he was once booed by England fans. Admittedly it was at Upton Park, where the locals have never forgiven him for leaving West Ham, and England were in the process of losing 3-1 to Australia, but it still feels slightly surreal to remember Lampard was the most abject performer on a night Sven-Goran Eriksson would rather forget. </p> <p>The nadir of Lampard's international career came on the same evening that Wayne Rooney, then aged 17 years 111 days, became the youngest England international, beating the record set by James Prinsep of Clapham Rovers in 1879, with 134 days to spare. As English football hailed the new kid on the block, Lampard slunk away almost apologetically. He had not been good enough and he knew it. </p> <p>His development since has been every bit as staggering as Rooney's own story. A fringe player six months ago, he is now a permanent fixture on the England teamsheet and was an ever-present at Euro 2004. He has started 11 of the past 12 internationals, playing at three different points of Eriksson's diamond, and scored five times in the last eight games - a record that Michael Owen, among others, would gladly boast. </p> <p>It was no surprise, therefore, to find the 26-year-old from Romford oozing confidence on the eve of his 27th cap. Lampard's body language as he stood straight-backed and looked his questioner in the eye was that of a man whom Wales have every right to fear. </p> <p>He was even self-possessed enough to give the sort of speech that is usually the captain's territory. \"In a game like this it's not so much about systems and more about the passion and work-rate,\" he said. </p> <p>\"You can talk about 4-4-2, three up front, diamonds, whatever you like, but in an England-Wales match it will start at 100mph and everyone will have to be at their very best from the first kick of the match. It's a question of having the right mind-set and believing in ourselves that in all the different match-ups all over the park we can come out on top. And as long as do that we will be fine.\" </p> <p>Strictly speaking, his own match-up will be against the right-back Mark Delaney. Yet Lampard's position on the left of midfield gives him licence to drift into the centre and make the surging runs into the penalty area which have become his forte. With Steven Gerrard missing through injury, there is even greater responsibility on him to dictate events in the middle, while Ashley Cole will be expected to add width and penetration on the left as an attacking full-back. </p> <p>\"We've worked on how we're going to play tactically. But most of all we have spoken about the extra passion compared with a normal match. We're ready for that and as professionals we pretty much understand that anyway. We have prepared our tactics and how we'll play but off the pitch we've also had meetings to discuss why this match has an extra edge to it. </p> <p>\"It's going to be an FA Cup atmosphere and we know what kind of surprises that competition has thrown up in the past. This game will have that feel to it and the important thing is that we match them for attitude, passion and work-rate, especially in the early stages. We need to take control and impose ourselves on them rather than the other way around.\" </p> <p>Lampard, always fit, always willing, sounds like a captain-in-waiting and it is easy to see why Eriksson now considers him indispensable, just as Jose Mourinho, and before him Claudio Ranieri, have done at Chelsea. </p> <p>\"It's nice to hear people say I can be considered like that [an automatic choice] but the most important thing is that the manager thinks that as well. I've played regularly in the last six months and my club form is good. I'm pretty pleased with that. I've played a lot of games for Chelsea in succession over the last few seasons [a Premiership record 116] and everything is going well apart from the fact I should maybe have scored two or three more goals this season.\" </p> <p>He has managed only one, a penalty against Southampton. \"But I'm getting in the right positions,\" he points out. \"To be fair to Jose Mourinho and Sven-Goran Eriksson, neither of them try to hold me back from going forward. If anything, Claudio Ranieri did that last season at times but I still scored 15 goals. I like to get forward at the right time and I've learned to do that over the years.\" </p> <p>For a player whose natural instinct is to attack, Lampard is relishing the prospect of Eriksson deploying Wayne Rooney just behind Owen and Jermain Defoe. </p> <p>\"We get criticised for not being attacking enough but those three are really exciting - their youthfulness, their ability, their pace. They play with no fear and, when you are blessed with three players like that, defenders are bound to be worried.\" </p> <p>Lampard's own scoring record is worthy of a striker. Not even the most fervent Eastender would boo him now. </p> <p><strong>Lampard's Run:</strong></p> <p>Records for consecutive Premiership appearances by outfield players </p> <p><strong> 1</strong> <strong> Frank Lampard</strong> (Chelsea) 116<br> <strong> 2</strong> <strong> Wayne Bridge</strong> (Soton) 113<br> <strong> 3</strong> <strong> Alan Shearer</strong> (Blackburn) 108<br> <strong> 4</strong> <strong> Gary Kelly</strong> (Leeds) 99<br> <strong> 5</strong> <strong> Robbie Fowler</strong> (Liverpool) 98<br></p>",
  "<p>Today's World Cup qualifier between England and Wales has produced sufficient interest for some to wonder why they do not do it more often - in other words revive the home international tournament which was last played 20 years ago. </p> <p>Last month's eventful World Cup encounter between Wales and Northern Ireland, which saw three players sent off and ended in a 2-2 draw, prompted similar calls. And, when England met Scotland in a two-legged play-off for the 2000 European Championship, the idea of the game's oldest international fixture again being played on an annual basis gained serious support. </p> <p>Surely, it is argued, the restoration of ancient rivalries would produce more compelling spectacles than England, Wales or Northern Ireland playing Azerbaijan or Scotland sharing a scoreless bore with Slovenia. There may even be some English supporters who will regret the absence of the suspended Robbie Savage from the Wales midfield this afternoon. </p> <p>Memories are short. The reality is that the British Championship, which was what the home internationals had become, was put out of its misery in 1984 after staggering past its 101st year. Attendances had declined to a point where the English and Scottish FAs, if not the Welsh and Northern Irish, could see no future for the competition. </p> <p>In that final spring only 14,250 watched Wales beat England 1-0 at Wrexham and a mere 7,845 turned up in Swansea to see a 1-1 draw with Northern Ireland, the eventual winners of the final tournament. True, Scotland's 1-1 draw with England was witnessed by a crowd of 73,064 at Hampden but only 24,000 had bothered to go along to Wembley to see England beat the Irish 1-0. </p> <p>The England-Scotland fixture continued for another five years, for the Rous Cup, but was beset by biennial bouts of English hooliganism in Glasgow before being abandoned after 1989. </p> <p>There were few mourners for the demise of the home internationals, although the Welsh and Northern Irish bodies could ill afford to lose the income even from the most meagre gates. The tournament had outlived its time and certainly the feeling in England was that the national side would be better employed playing the sort of opposition it was more likely to encounter in the World Cup or European Championship. </p> <p>The heyday of the home internationals was in the boom years of the immediate post-war period when it was the only competitive football in which the British teams were involved. Take the 1947-48 season when 55,000 packed Ninian Park on an October afternoon to see England beat Wales 3-0 with Tom Finney, Stan Mortensen and Tommy Lawton scoring in the first 20 minutes. </p> <p>A month later a Northern Irish side enriched by players of the quality of Johnny Carey and Peter Doherty held England 2-2 in front of a crowd of 67,980 at Goodison Park. The following April England won 2-0 at Hampden where the attendance figure soared to 135,376. Frank Swift, the England goalkeeper, played the last quarter-hour with two broken ribs. </p> <p>By the late 1960s a fixture list swollen by European competitions and the League Cup, plus the growing reluctance of clubs to release players for their countries, persuaded the authorities to confine the home internationals to a week tacked on to the end of the season. But it was only a partial success. </p> <p>While England's two Wembley fixtures, against Wales and Scotland, were seen, respectively, by crowds of 70,000 and 100,000, only 7,483 bothered to watch Scotland play Northern Ireland in Hampden's huge bowl. Denis Law was in the home side, George Best was there for the visitors, yet the match barely raised a mutter from the terraces, let alone a roar. </p> <p>From then on, whereas the home internationals had once reflected the excellence of the British game they increasingly mirrored its limitations. The England v Scotland fixture still had its moments - Don Revie's side winning 5-1 at Wembley, for example, or Kenny Dalglish scoring through Ray Clemence's legs the following year - but eventually it became a jaw-aching yawn. </p> <p>Rather than restore the seasonal travail of the British Championship it is surely better now to enjoy these chance encounters in World Cup or European Championship qualifiers and hope that one day all four again reach the finals of a major tournament, as they did in Sweden in 1958. </p> <p>Admitted the odds are against such an occurrence. In the meantime the Welsh can today treasure memories of beating England 1-0 in their previous encounter in 1984, not to mention that 4-1 win against Ron Greenwood's team three years earlier. Unhappily for Wales Larry Lloyd is no longer England's centre-half. </p> <p>Among most vivid personal memories of the home internationals is of Best destroying a Scotland team virtually single-handed in Belfast in 1967 - that and the moment when Sir Alf Ramsey and his England squad landed in Glasgow in 1968 for an annual encounter with the old enemy which was doubling as a European Nations Cup qualifier. </p> <p>\"Welcome to Scotland, Sir Alf,\" declared a member of the Scottish press corps. </p> <p>\"You must be fuckin' jokin',\" replied the knight of the realm. </p> <p>Such home fires can never burn so brightly again.</p>",
  "Philip Gooden, in the introduction to his new book, Who's Whose? A No-Nonsense Guide to Easily Confused Words, says: \"Anybody who writes about English usage needs to face the question: does it matter? Is the misuse - or abuse - of language truly important? ... Are slips of the tongue where one says less instead of fewer, or uncertainties whether to write phase or faze really significant? Sometimes, the answer must be no.\" <p>Indeed it must, but very often - as readers of the Guardian so frequently tell me - the answer must be yes. To take a few recent examples from my postbag: \"I enclose [so-and-so's] excellent article - excellent apart from his misuse of the word 'disinterest'. It grieves me that such misuse is becoming more and more common.\" </p> <p>Grief, generally speaking, may be overstating the reaction, but frustration, irritation, despair and depression are familiar words in the lexicon of protest about such matters. One reader, pointing out the use of criteria instead of the singular criterion, managed to use the word \"depressing\" three times in one short paragraph expressing his anguish. </p> <p>Another recent correspondent objecting to \"like\" in place of \"as if\" - \"She makes it sound like she's fronting Lewisham's Olympic bid\" - sent me a letter to forward to the writer telling him to \"Try reading the style guide.\" </p> <p>A reader, poring over the story of a recent sex scandal, asked whether one of the parties really wanted to \"affect\" a reconciliation with his wife, or, altogether more securely, \"effect\" a reconciliation. </p> <p>Some readers seem more vigilante than vigilant and send me little sheaves of cuttings with the same \"error\" ringed on each: a heading saying, \"The kids are alright\"; a cartoon line saying, \"The Elephant of Light is alright!\"; and a note said to have been written by the Queen when discussing a headstone for a deceased corgi: \"I think for accuracy's sake, we ought to put [Susan lived] for almost 15 years - the rest is quite alright.\" \"Did the Queen really write that?\" the reader exclaimed. </p> <p>Gooden's book, I think, will prove to be genuinely useful for writers - and their critics. It is well illustrated with examples of right and wrong uses taken in the majority of cases from the daily newspapers. I particularly recommend it to dys peptic correspondents who appear to think the Guardian is the only one that slips up. </p> <p>On affect and effect, for example, Gooden cites the following slip-ups: \"Concern about job security now effects everyone\" (the Times); \"And he had the same affect on his players\" (the Sun); \"The crash of 1929 had profound affects on law and order\" (the Independent on Sunday). </p> <p>The tone of Gooden's comments is rightly reasonable. \"Almost everybody mixes up their affects and effects from time to time. The general sense of what you are writing is unlikely to be affected, but it's still a mistake.\" He then offers advice on how to avoid the error. </p> <p>On the other examples from my own postbag, he recognises the common confusion of disinterested and uninterested, and says, \"If you are sensitive to English and want to preserve valuable distinctions of meaning you will not talk about being disinterested in the sense of uninterested.\" </p> <p>He has more or less thrown in the towel on \"like\" for \"as if\" - \"Timberlake wore something that looked like [should be as if] it had come from the Young Casuals department at M&amp;S\" (Daily Telegraph) - saying, \"I am afraid the truth is that it is acceptable.\" He argues that the use of \"like\" is now so firmly embedded that \"in some contexts, it would be embarrassing to use the rather formal 'as if' construction.\" </p> <p>On criterion/criteria, he says: \"This is an error that shows up the ignorance of the user, and for someone who is alert to such things it will sound almost as jarring as 'we is'.\" </p> <p>On all right/alright, he says: \"Alright ... is regarded by what is probably a diminishing number as less correct than all right. Even so it is better avoided in formal writing.\" </p> <p>It is a soundly practical book, although one may perhaps be forgiven for wondering whether euphemism and euphuism are often confused. No examples are given. Oddly I encountered \"euphuism\" consciously for the first time this week in Hazlitt's essay On Reading New Books: \"What should we say in our time to the euphuism of the age of Elizabeth, when style was made a riddle and the court talked in conundrums?\" Dictionary time. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Who's Whose is published on October 18, by Bloomsbury at \u00a39.99.

  "During this week of American election debates, Charles Duelfer, the former deputy executive chairman of the UN weapons inspectors and current head of the CIA's Iraq Survey Group, delivered to Congress his much-anticipated report on Iraq's WMD capabilities. Among his controversial conclusions is that, contrary to pre-war assertions by both the George Bush administration and Tony Blair's government, Iraq had neither stockpiles of WMD nor dedicated programmes for the manufacture of WMD. Duelfer's report did note that Iraq maintained so-called \"dual-use\" facilities (those with legitimate civilian and/or military functions, but which could be configured for proscribed use), but his ISG has found no evidence that any such conversion had taken place. <p>One would expect the ISG's conclusions to take the wind out of the sails of those who repeat the mantra that Iraq was a grave and growing threat. But Duelfer has provided a convenient escape from such criticism, by concluding that Saddam Hussein in fact fully intended to convert his \"dual use\" factories into WMD production facilities once UN weapons inspectors left. In one fell swoop, Duelfer has provided the ideal cover for the justification of the war. </p> <p>Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, was quick to note that Saddam was, according to the ISG report, \"a gathering threat that needed to be taken seriously, that it was a matter of time before he was going to begin pursuing those weapons of mass destruction\". The UK foreign secretary, Jack Straw, commenting on the report from Baghdad, was likewise quick to jump on the notion of intent. \"Where this report breaks new ground,\" Straw said, \"is by producing extensive new evidence showing that Saddam did indeed pose a threat to the international community ... The world is a safer place without him.\" </p> <p>There are, however, several problems with this finding - first and foremost the notion of legality, especially in light of UN secretary general Kofi Annan's comments that the US-led invasion of Iraq represented a violation of the UN charter and international law. Bush and Blair have argued that because the Iraqi government had failed to comply with previous security council resolutions regarding Iraq's obligation to disarm, the right of enforcing these resolutions is implicit. </p> <p>Duelfer's report slams the door on that line of thinking, since it is now clear that Iraq had in fact disarmed in compliance with security council resolutions. One of the tragic ironies of the decision to invade Iraq is that the Iraqi WMD declaration required by security council resolution 1441, submitted by Iraq in December 2002, and summarily rejected by Bush and Blair as repackaged falsehoods, now stands as the most accurate compilation of data yet assembled regarding Iraq's WMD programmes (more so than even Duelfer's ISG report, which contains much unsubstantiated speculation). Saddam Hussein has yet to be contradicted on a single point of substantive fact. Iraq had disarmed; no one wanted to accept that conclusion. </p> <p>Charles Duelfer has to date provided no documentation to back up his assertion regarding Saddam's \"intent\". Nor has he produced any confession from Saddam Hussein or any senior Iraqi official regarding the same. What has been offered is a compilation of hearsay and conjecture linked to unnamed sources whose identities remain shrouded in secrecy. </p> <p>There is one source I am certain will not be quoted in Duelfer's report - a former officer in Saddam Hussein's intelligence service, who was interviewed by the ISG repeatedly in the summer of 2003. Given the ongoing violence in Iraq today, this officer, who is well known to me, has asked that his name not be published. From 1992 until 2003, he headed a branch of Iraqi intelligence responsible for monitoring the work of the UN weapons inspectors. His office intercepted their communications, and recruited spies among their ranks in Baghdad, Bahrain, New York and elsewhere. </p> <p>The mission of this intelligence unit was to discern the true intent of the UN weapons inspectors. Conventional thinking would hold that this was being done so that Iraq might better hide its WMD stockpiles. The Iraqi officer has long denied this, stating that instead his job was to find out why the UN refused to accept the Iraqi version of events, and to determine if the UN weapons inspectors were operating inside Iraq for purposes other than the disarmament. </p> <p>This officer claims to have intercepted conversations between Charles Duelfer, during the time he served as deputy executive chairman of the UN inspection teams, and senior US government officials, in New York and Baghdad, where a US agenda (supported by the British) for removing Saddam Hussein was discussed. I can confirm that such discussions frequently took place. </p> <p>According to this officer, after 1995 UN weapons inspectors were blocked by Iraq only when their actions were determined by the Iraqi government to represent a direct threat to the president of Iraq, a reality the intercepted Duelfer conversations and ongoing CIA efforts to mount a coup d'etat would seem to underscore. </p> <p>Duelfer is not an unbiased observer in this matter. For this reason alone, his ISG report must not be allowed to hide its findings behind a wall of secrecy. Far from showing the intent of Saddam Hussein to keep WMD, I believe a full review of all material relevant to the ISG's report will instead portray a dictator whose only desire was to retain his hold on power in the face of a US government which intended to do anything, including violate international law, to prevent this. </p> <p>The US Congress and British parliament should insist on a full declassification of the ISG report, as well as the sources used to compile it. During this critical time in both our nations' histories, with the war in Iraq playing such a central role in the selection of America's next president as well as the political future of Britain's prime minister, the American and British people deserve to know the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, about the casus belli that collectively got us into the ongoing quagmire that is Iraq today. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Scott Ritter was a UN weapons inspector in Iraq between 1991 and 1998 and is the author of Frontier Justice: Weapons of Mass Destruction and the Bushwhacking of America </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:WSRitter@aol.com\">WSRitter@aol.com</a></p>",
  "Cross-Channel operator Hoverspeed has filed a \u00a350m lawsuit against Customs and Excise for deterring day-trippers by forcing travellers to undergo \"heavy handed\" searches for excess alcohol and cigarettes. <p>Hoverspeed won a test case two years ago in which it claimed officers were not entitled to carry out random checks but needed grounds for suspicion. At the time, it successfully acted on behalf of a family which had 25,200 cigarettes, 8kg (17.5lb) of tobacco, two cases of wine and some spirits seized. </p> <p>The appeal court ruled that although officials were entitled to use profiling techniques, which take into account factors such as age, background and ethnicity, they could not stop people purely by chance. Hoverspeed, which runs high-speed services between Dover and Calais, and Newhaven and Dieppe, maintains that years of historic random checks put thousands of people off travelling, reducing its income from tickets and on-board sales. </p> <p>The case is being fought by Hoverspeed's Bermuda-based parent company, Sea Containers, which also owns the inter-city trains firm GNER. </p> <p>Under European law, travellers do not have to pay excise duty on tobacco and alcohol which they import for their personal use.</p> <p>Customs and Excise has set informal limits on \"personal use\" of 3,200 cigarettes, 110 litres of beer, 90 litres of wine or 10 litres of spirits.</p> <p>At a meeting in Brussels this week, the European Commission criticised Britain for applying the rules too rigorously. It said innocent shoppers were being caught up in over-zealous checks.</p>",
  "<p>There are few fairy godmothers who have turned their charges back into a pumpkin. But Karen Thomson, the UK head of internet service provider AOL, did exactly that when she consigned her Cinderella to the wastebasket of dotcom history last year.</p> <p>Connie, for those who were living in a cave during the heady days of the internet boom, was the prissy, public face of the American company this side of the Atlantic until the advertising campaign she starred in was unceremoniously dumped last summer. </p> <p>\"I did not invent her myself,\" the 43- year-old Scot explained in her office at AOL UK's headquarters in Hammersmith, west London. \"I am not Connie's mother, I was more like her fairy godmother, saying 'you shall go to the ball'.\" </p> <p>The ball lasted five years as AOL used Connie - Rachel Willis, daughter of the Liberal Democrat MP Phil Willis - to persuade middle England to get online.</p> <p>\"Connie was all about hand-holding,\" said Thomson. She was the acceptable face of the internet, hawking a safe and secure way to get onto the net. But while the public seemed to like her, others in the media were not so keen. Campaign, the advertising industry bible, gave her the ignominious title of biggest turkey of 2000, the height of the boom. </p> <p>The decision to axe Connie - \"We decided that she would go off and spend more time with her family,\" Thomson quipped - came as AOL moved itself into the market for providing fast, always-on broadband internet access. </p> <p>Moving its customers from dial-up internet access to the world of broadband is part of an evolutionary process that is still continuing. </p> <p>This month the industry regulator Ofcom will give its first indication of what the UK's communications market should look like and AOL is already planning for that future, looking at internet telephony, video-on-demand and even ways of leveraging its mammoth brand in the mobile phone world. </p> <p>And while Connie lasted just five years, Thomson has been with the firm for nine. Not bad for somebody who started out training to be a doctor and refuses to be labelled a \"techie\" in an industry where nerds rule. </p> <p>Born in Dundee, her family moved across the Tay and Firth of Forth when she was nine and she grew up in Edinburgh. After leaving school she went to university in Aberdeen, choosing medicine because everybody at the time seemed to think a profession was the best idea. It wasn't. </p> <p>\"I got there and met lots of people who had a true vocation for medicine and I thought, 'I am not entirely sure I do have the vocation for it',\" she said. </p> <p>\"I remember opening this folder which was essentially my work plan for the next five years, so I could say 'in four years time on Monday, 17 August, at whatever time, I will be doing this' and almost none of it was about dealing with people. </p> <p>\"So I said, 'I am not enjoying this and next year I want to change'. The dean said, 'we throw people out, they don't leave' but they eventually realised I had thought about it a lot.\" </p> <p>She moved on to an arts course and specialised in philosophy. While great fun at the time, it was not necessarily the most vocational of degrees and when she emerged from academia into the harsh recessionary climate of the early 1980s, it became obvious that a deep understanding of moral philosophy was no help in getting a job. </p> <p>She ended up selling advertising on the Aberdeen Evening Express and the Press and Journal. When asked whether she enjoyed it, she faltered. \"I would say it is the most high pressure, hardest work I have ever done in my entire life. I would not say I enjoyed it, I enjoyed working with the people ... but for me it was the job when I started to see that I was interested in marketing.\"</p> <p>After getting married in 1985, her husband, Neil, was offered a job with a London- based consultancy firm. </p> <p>They decided to give London two years. In fact she has been 'down south' for almost two decades but retains her broad Scottish accent. </p> <p>Following a marketing services job with a company that made controls for lifts, she realised that her slightly eccentric academic background was doing her few favours - \"partly because every job I went for they asked me why I had done a philosophy degree and the whole thing about how it teaches you to think properly was not helping\". </p> <p>Thomson enrolled on a three-year, parttime MBA course at Middlesex University and switched jobs, joining a communications company in the fast-growing world of pagers and mobile telephones - first with a subsidiary of BellSouth and then with Mercury. </p> <p>She finished at Middlesex just as she became pregnant. It was one of the few times during our conversation that she talked about the position of women in the world of work. </p> <p>\"When I think back, there were very few women on the course. I was a good bit younger than the norm and I do not think any women who had kids finished the course. I think dealing with the three together would have been hideous.\" </p> <p>After the birth of her daughter she took a break, taking part-time marketing consultancy work until a fateful call from a headhunter friend in 1995. \"She said, 'I've got this really bizarre job and I thought of you immediately'.\" </p> <p>It was with a yet to be named internet company that wanted somebody with expertise in branding and direct marketing. At the time only a few people this side of the Atlantic knew about the worldwide web, and Thomson frankly admitted: \"I wasn't one of them\". </p> <p>During her interview she boldly informed her prospective bosses that it would take longer than they hoped to get up and running, and then asked to actually see the service. She was hooked. </p> <p>\"The first time you move from a text-based environment to a graphics-based environment, as basic as it was, you go 'oh, so I can just click here?'. Then suddenly an instant message popped up.\" </p> <p>\"I remember thinking there is something there. I went home that night and said to Neil, 'Well, I think I'm too bossy for them to start with because I have told them they cannot launch when they want to, but I saw this thing called instant messaging' and he is looking at me like 'how dull is this'.\" </p> <p>Despite his reservations, she became the fifth employee of AOL in the UK, joining as marketing director. As she predicted, the company launched at the start of 1996. Her experience in the cut-throat world of direct marketing served AOL well at the beginning. Although it now uses its own call centre staff and retailers - most notably the former Freeserve backer Dixons - to attract customers, AOL originally built its customer base by pushing CD-rom disks through people's letterboxes and into magazines and newspapers. At the time, its biggest draw was the offer of a free trial and by August 1996, AOL had attracted 50,000 customers. That doubled by the following Easter and by 1998, the company had more than 500,000 subscribers.</p> <p>Now AOL UK has more than 2.3 million customers, with more than half a million of those taking one of its three broadband offerings. It also made a profit last year, although Thomson is unwilling to say how much. </p> <p>Whether that is sustainable, however, with AOL's bitter rival Wanadoo - formerly Freeserve - offering broadband at a loss-leading price of \u00a317.99, remains to be seen. \"You have got to be competitive on price,\" she admitted, but she believes that people will pay a little extra not to have the amount they can download each month capped - as is the case with the Wanadoo service and BT's \u00a319.99 offering. </p> <p>\"Obviously we want to lead the market but it is not a question of doing that at any price,\" she said. </p> <p>So what about the future? Many in the industry are getting excited about the prospects of local loop unbundling - the process by which BT will have to give up its stranglehold on the phone line that connects every house in the country to a local exchange. Across the Channel this process has allowed rivals to France T\u00e9l\u00e9com to offer very fast broadband, digital television, video-on-demand and even free local and national calls for about \u00a325 a month. </p> <p>Here, AOL UK is already looking into unbundling partners to provide it with the network capabilities to challenge BT. It will also be using an interim access technology BT is being pressed to provide known as Datastream - which opens the door to products above and beyond the basic broadband services available until now. </p> <p>\"I would be fibbing if I said to you we weren't looking at fixed-line, mobile, video etc, and that we were on different stages of development on all those things; of course we are.\" </p> <p>\"It's a question of deciding where the focus should be and when we introduce those products .\" It looks as if the fairy godmother is preparing to wave her wand again.</p>",
  "<p>The long-running <strong> Moss Bros</strong> saga continued yesterday as speculation ran through the market that a new investor had approached Kevin Stanford, the co-founder of Karen Millen and the gents' outfitter's biggest shareholder, to buy his stake. </p> <p>There have been persistent rumours about the future of the business since Shami Ahmed, the Joe Bloggs jeans entrepreneur, sold his stake to Mr Stanford over the summer. Mr Stanford now controls 28% of the business. </p> <p>It has always been speculated that he would pay up to 110p per share for control of the company but traders said yesterday that the investor who approached him was willing to pay 115p per share. </p> <p>Moss Bros closed up 2.5p at 92p. </p> <p>Back in the blue chips, the FTSE 100 closed just 0.2 points higher at 4698.9 on rather low volume of 2bn as many traders held off ahead of the weekend. </p> <p>One strong performer was <strong> Man Group</strong>, which gained another 35p to 1397p on persistent talk that the hedge fund manager could be the subject of a takeover from a US financial institution. Traders were talking excitedly early in the day about a bid from Merrill Lynch for the company at 1850p a share. </p> <p><strong> Reuters</strong> added 11.5p to 346p as a memo to staff by the chief executive, Tom Glocer, was released into the market. The memo followed a three-day meeting of the group's management committee last week in New York, which was called in an effort to agree the budget for 2005. </p> <p>In his memo, Mr Glocer told staff: \"Above all else, we acknowledged things would be tough in 2005 but we confidently set a budget that shows Reuters growing our revenues for the first time in four years.\" </p> <p><strong> Aviva</strong> added 1.5p to 568p after the head of its Norwich Union business, Gary Withers, told analysts in a seminar that his business was targeting a 15% to 20% share of the UK life insurance market. That would be an improvement on the 12% the company grabbed in the first half of this year. </p> <p><strong> Reed Elsevier</strong> dropped 7p to 501p after Citigroup cut its stance on the stock to sell from hold and moved its price target to 450p from 500p. </p> <p>Away from the main index, the FTSE 250 closed down 4.6 points at 6379.5 points with the small-cap index picking up 1.4 points to 2606.5. </p> <p> <strong> Ark Therapeutics</strong> gained 3.5p to 84.25p on the back of recent coverage about the impact on the NHS of the increased cost of treating diabetes. Ark, which floated in March but has seen its share price drop below the issue price, has developed a treatment for diabetic leg ulcers that is already on the market. The treatment, Kerraboot, has been shown in trials to reduce treatment costs by up to 40% and nurses' time by up to 70%. </p> <p> <strong> HMV Group</strong> closed up 4.5p at 239.5p as analysts at CSFB maintained their outperform stance on the stock while Lastminute gained 2.5p to 122.5p as investors trickled back into the shares after recent falls. </p> <p>Worries about its upcoming results on Tuesday hurt shares in the specialist printing business <strong> St Ives</strong>, down 8.5p at 377.25p, but talk that trading at <strong> Roxboro</strong> has been strong helped shares in the electronics group gain 10p to 346.5p. Traders believe that Roxboro's Solartron electronic measurement and Dialight electronic lighting businesses have performed well recently and earnings for the second half of the year will come in comfortably ahead of expectations. </p> <p>But <strong> PHS Group</strong> saw its shares drop 4p to 72p after the support services group, which provides things such as handtowels and sanitary disposal units for British washrooms, warned that margins remained under pressure. Although PHS said trading in the first half of the year had been in line with expectations, it added that a switch by customers to lower margin products coupled with its own need to increase investment had \"affected\" margins. </p> <p>Shares in the medical equipment group <strong> Corin Group</strong> jumped after the maker of joint implants said it had received a takeover approach. Traders im mediately identified the US-based Stryker Corp as the most obvious bidder. <strong> Corin</strong> closed up 64.5p to 379.5p, valuing the business at about \u00a3150m. </p> <p>Down on Aim, <strong> Monstermob</strong> leapt 30p to end the day at 126p as TecCapital, a company controlled by the reclusive Barclay brothers, bought a 7.55% stake. </p> <p> <strong> River Diamonds</strong> added 0.37p to 3.125p as the diamond mining and exploration business announced it had secured exploration rights to more than 5,000 hectares in the Mato Grosso state of Brazil. </p> <p>The secondary matched-bargain share market <strong> Ofex</strong> became the subject of something of a coup yesterday as traders from Aim announced a \u00a33.15m fundraising at 5p that will see the underwriters Numis earn a fee of several hundred thousand pounds. </p> <p>Simon Brickles, the ex-head of Aim, is to be chief executive, ousting Ofex's joint managing directors, Emma and Jonathan Jenkins, whose father John founded the market. </p> <p>But the Jenkins family still control 50% of the company and the plan needs shareholder approval. With other bidders still waiting in the wings, this deal is by no means done and shares in Ofex dropped 1p to 6.75p. </p> <p>Finally, <strong> Allergy Therapeutics</strong> is expected to enjoy a good debut when the speciality pharmaceutical company, focused upon the treatment and prevention of allergies, comes to market on Monday at 73p. </p> <p>The placing, orchestrated by KBC Peel Hunt, is understood to have been three times oversubscribed. Allergy Therapeutics was founded in 1998 by a management buy-in of the CL Bencard allergy business of GlaxoSmithKline and the drugs group will retain a 74% stake after the float. </p> <p><strong> Empire: game on</strong> </p> <p>Momentum seems to be building behind Empire Interactive as the Aim-listed entertainment software company moves into the crucial Christmas trading period. </p> <p>Shares in the company, whose most recent XBox and PS2 titles include Mashed and Big Mutha Truckers, rose 0.75p to 11p as traders reported strong demand from institutional investors. </p> <p>The company is also close to announcing further distribution deals along the lines of its recent link-up with Vivendi Universal's gaming business. The Anglo-French conglomerate is distributing Empire's FlatOut game in the US market under the deal. </p> <p>Yesterday Empire's chief executive, Ian Higgins, said there are other deals \"that we expect to be able to talk about soon\". </p> <p>He added that contrary to some speculation, the company has not seen significant pressure on prices among its top titles in the run-up to Christmas. In addition Empire's own value brand, Xplosiv, is currently seeing \"large volume\". </p> <p>\"We're entering the period in good shape,\" Mr Higgins added.</p>",
  "<p>Occasionally, as emperors should check their new clothes aren't just a figment of collective delusion, so the bubble of presumptions within which financial commentators operate needs pricking. I received such a reality check from a reader recently. His straightforward questions about the functioning of the stock market were a reminder of the absurdity of much analysis of its day to day movements. </p> <p>One issue vexed my correspondent: \"How does a change in the price of the shares in a company come about?\" How indeed! Trawl any collection of newspaper market reports, tune into any radio business bulletin, hang about the City's hostelries and you will hear price movements ascribed to a diverse set of causes ranging from the rudely mechanical to the downright bizarre. And each one merely an opinion. </p> <p>It is no wonder an observer might be bewildered. This one certainly is: \"Perhaps the change is arrived at by pure supply and demand, between people who want to sell the shares and people who want to acquire them, or perhaps the change is based on the perceived ability of a company to generate future profits. Or may it be the change in the share price is fixed arbitrarily by stockbrokers acting individually or together? Or is it that ups and downs are necessary to make profits dealing? </p> <p>\"It seems to me that, in many cases, despite the changes in share values, the company has the same value as before, with the same number of factories or lorries on the premises. Obviously world events may affect the profitability of companies to some extent. But it seems to indicate amazing skill on the part of the dealers or whomsoever to be able to translate these events into precise figures. Or are the prices merely an approximation, or just a guess?\" </p> <p>The answer, no doubt frustratingly, is a bit of each of these, with the mix varying from situation to situation. The textbook laws of supply and demand were never intended to be capable of mechanistic application in the real world. Instead, an understanding of their dynamics does enable a degree of insight into the oscillations of asset prices. </p> <p>As in any market, whether it be car boot sale or for Connaught Square properties, an elaborate game of spoof is played between sellers and potential buyers. Prices advertised and ultimate transaction values often differ greatly. The willingness of each party to entertain the idea of a trade will depend on a variety of underlying forces, many hidden from the scrutiny of the other. At different possible prices, the balance of these forces will change, negative ones having less impact at lower prices and vice versa. Eventually, a price may be found at which willing buyer and willing seller meet. </p> <p>The stock market is no different. Most investors value companies on the basis of either their component assets, or their future profits - the further out the profits, the lower the current value ascribed. In effect these come to the same thing, as a business's assets are employed to generate a future profit stream. </p> <p>Buyers and sellers circle one another in the market for shares as in any other. Stockbrokers and market makers, taking their own views of corporate prospects and with an eye to making money from trading volumes, do adjust prices displayed on trading screens in an attempt to find the price levels that will clear the market. They put their own trading capital at risk in this process - they are often the marginal buyer or seller themselves, hoping they know where the \"real\" business might ultimately be. </p> <p>While there is nothing purely arbitrary about this process, there is little that is scientific either. </p> <p>There is indeed much that is approximate, much that is guesswork. The future is by definition unknown, the number of factors affecting corporate prospects huge and the pool of actual and potential investors enormous. This is particularly true of the largest companies, whose share prices consequently appear to oscillate constantly. </p> <p>You can view this as the clearing price for a company's shares being constantly just beyond the market's reach. Alternatively, you might conclude that its share price is constantly at the correct level, but that the ever-changing balance of forces ensures that the perfect price lasts only for a fleeting instant before shifting to a new value. </p> <p>Of course, the numbers of factories, lorries or people that make up a business do not change with such rapidity and frequency. It is little wonder, then, that it is not only outsiders but also even industrialists who struggle to make sense of share prices. They have to accept that, whether or not their actual prospects are changing, perceptions about those prospects are the subject of constant review by the markets - a review not conducted in isolation but in the context of investors' wide range of alternatives. </p> <p>It is no wonder, then, that busy market reporters often pluck a single newsworthy factor to explain a share price move. They may not be wrong, but it would require much, much more to be completely right. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmond.warner@theguardian.com\">edmond.warner@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>After two high-profile failures, Standard Chartered yesterday won a controlling stake in an Indonesian bank when it was declared the preferred bidder for the government's 51% of Bank Permata. </p> <p>Indonesia's finance minister, Boediono, said Standard Chartered and its partner, local car maker Astra International, offered 2.77 trillion rupiah (\u00a3171m) for the shares. </p> <p>This is 22% more than the cash-strapped Indonesian government had hoped for and 3.18 times Permata's 2003 book value. </p> <p>None of the five banks Indonesia has sold since the 1997 financial crisis went for more than twice their book value. </p> <p>The deal is subject to the sales and purchase agreement being finalised and the bid being approved by Indonesia's central bank. These are expected to be concluded by the end of next month. </p> <p>Standard Chartered - which refused to confirm the amount offered - said the book value ratio was historic and did not necessarily reflect current performance. </p> <p>\"With our partner we've put in a realistic bid,\" Paul Marriage, the head of the bank's corporate communications, told the Guardian. \"We've said consistently that we wouldn't overpay for acquisitions.\" </p> <p>A Jakarta-based analyst with Credit Lyonnaise, Michael Chambers, agreed. </p> <p>\"Standard Chartered has a lower funding cost than the others so the profit will expand more quickly.\" </p> <p>Standard Chartered's win ning bid beat three others, submitted by Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation with its local partner PT Bank Pan Indonesia, Malayan Banking and Malaysia's Commerce Bank. </p> <p>Singapore's United Overseas Bank, which was also short-listed for the Permata auction, did not submit a bid. </p> <p>Permata is an amalgam of five banks that suffered enormously during the Asian crisis. It has 310 branches and 1.2m customers in Indonesia while Standard Chartered has only 14 branches, despite having had a presence in the country for 140 years. </p> <p>The British bank's two previous attempts to buy an Indonesian bank were in 1999, when it targeted Bank Bali, and three years later, when it lost an auction for Bank Central Asia.</p>",
  "Graphic accounts of beatings, mock executions and the imprisonment and killings of men and boys at a checkpoint in Afghanistan were described to a jury at the Old Bailey yesterday by the attorney general as he opened the first torture prosecution of its kind in the world. <p>In the dock of court nine an Afghan man from Streatham, south London, sat taking notes and sipping water. Wearing a jumper and tracksuit bottoms, Faryadi Sarwar Zardad, 42, bent his head towards an interpreter seated next to him as the charges against him - conspiracy to torture and conspiracy to take hostages - were outlined. He denies the charges. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said it was believed to be the first time that an alleged torturer had been prosecuted in one jurisdiction for offences said to have been carried out in another. </p> <p>As an Afghan warlord known as Commander Zardad, the defendant was in charge of a crucial checkpoint near Sarobi and the Afghan frontier with Pakistan in the mid-90s, Lord Goldsmith said. With up to 1,000 men under his command, he controlled the supply route to Kabul, and allegedly ordered his armed men to torture and imprison civilians. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith gave an account from a witness of a \"human dog\" kept in a hole by Mr Zardad: \"The human dog was biting people and eating testicles under the orders of soldiers at the checkpoint.\" </p> <p>Other victims were beaten with rifle butts, hung from the ceiling and attacked with rubber pipes, and threatened with rape. Some had their ears cut off, he said. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith told the jury the case concerned events in Afghanistan between 1992 and 1996, after the Soviet withdrawal from the country and during the rule of rival warlords. Mr Zardad had been arrested in England but under international conventions and law, torturers could be pursued across any borders. </p> <p>\"There are some crimes which are so heinous, such an affront to justice, that they can be tried in any country,\" the attorney general said. </p> <p>He also said: \"We believe this to be the first time in any country ... where offences of torture and hostage taking have been prosecuted in circumstances such as this.\" </p> <p>Mr Zardad, a supporter of the warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, controlled three checkpoints at Sarobi, some 50 miles outside Kabul. \"He and his soldiers wanted to create an atmosphere of fear and terror,\" the attorney general said. </p> <p>\"He wanted a fearsome reputation of being cruel and merciless at his military checkpoints, so that people passing through would obey them absolutely and give them money and goods. He would use indiscriminate and unwarranted violence ... they would beat, wound, shoot and kill civilians ... detain and imprison them ... hold them hostage for ransom.\" </p> <p>Images of Mr Zardad and a group of 100 men carrying Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers as they gathered at the arid, mountainous Sarobi checkpoint on the Jalalabad road came up on screens in the court as Lord Goldsmith spoke. </p> <p>The videos were discovered in Mr Zardad's Streatham flat when he was arrested. Footage showed him allegedly embracing Mr Hekmatyar and overseeing a march past of his men. </p> <p>The screens will next week carry evidence from witnesses who will give their testimony from the British embassy in Kabul. Yesterday they were filled with maps of Afghanistan, the Khyber Pass and the Sarobi checkpoints as the country's history was explained to the jury. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said one alleged victim would tell how he had been picked up as he travelled from Kabul with two friends. They were imprisoned in a copper mine for five months by Mr Zardad's men. </p> <p>\"He describes being tortured and 24 men being killed ... he was handcuffed and shackled ... he heard people screaming as they were tortured and saw the rubber pipes used to beat prisoners. Prisoners were hung from the ceiling and beaten until they lost control of their functions.\" </p> <p>One woman went to Mr Zardad's checkpoint to see her imprisoned son, the jury was told. \"He was in a room with bars like a prison. He was very weak, had blood on his face.\" The woman asked for his release and was told to pay for it with a large sum of money. On her return with the cash, one of the commanders told her her son was dead. </p> <p>\"She has never found his body,\" the attorney general said. </p> <p>One journalist, who encountered Mr Zardad many times at Sarobi, had said: \"His men took great pleasure in humiliating people and beating them up, including mock executions.\" </p> <p>Mr Zardad, the jury heard, fled to northern Afghanistan when the Taliban took Sarobi in 1996. From there he eventually made his way to Britain, where he was arrested. </p> <p>Many of the alleged victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, later picked him out on video identity parades, the court heard. During interviews with British police he accepted that he had been in charge of up to 1,000 men at Sarobi and was a commander of the armed group known as Hezb-i-Islami. </p> <p>Anthony Jennings QC, defending, told the jury to keep \"an open mind, cool head and calm heart\". He said: \"In many parts of the world he and his men were regarded as peasant freedom fighters. Having fought the Russians, having fought the Taliban, Zardad now fights for his future, and it is in your hands.\" </p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "The Muscovites' rural retreats are alive with the sound of - bulldozers. After years of the new rich ploughing their dubiously acquired wealth into vast country dachas, the authorities, anxious to remind everyone who is in charge, are tearing them down. <p>The first victim was in Silver Springs, a small but elite settlement near the exclusive Gorky 2 area in the Zvenigorod region. The state newspaper Rossiskaya Gazeta ran a large picture on its front page yesterday of a two-storey building in its mock-Tudor splendour and another, taken moments later, of the bulldozer picking its way through the rubble. </p> <p>Instead of tearing down the more palatial residences on the land, the bulldozer went straight for the outhouse where the servants live and the telephone exchange is kept. A parrot - the house's only remaining resident - died during the procedure. </p> <p>Oleg Mitvol who, as head of the federal agency for surveying the use of natural resources, has become chief scourge of the luxury dacha, was on hand with a busload of journalists. </p> <p>The company which owned the house decided to destroy it rather than go to court, he explained. But without court approval, \"we can't drive bulldozers and destroy other cottages. </p> <p>\"I hope that after this case many would think it is better to destroy a cottage than to spend years in court.\" </p> <p>He added that the house was destroyed because it was allegedly on land which had been appropriated improperly. </p> <p>The drama was designed to send a message to the owners of 1,500 other dachas accused of breaking the law, and the other 1,600 hectares (4,000 acres) of illegally acquired land. </p> <p>The bulldozer has long been a feature of the Moscow woods, albeit there to build up rather than rip down dachas. In the past few years fences have been going up all over the woods as private companies seek to seal off land for hugely profitable developments. </p> <p>Compounds with names like Dreamland, behind whose high gates lurk fake Tudor mansions, provide status symbols to rich Russians. To a people who can still remember what it was like to all be equal, it is yet another way of feeling different from, or better than, your neighbour. </p> <p>The campaign to rein in the growth of dachas across Moscow's rural hinterland has raged all summer. Some believe the authorities are seeking to punish the corrupt elite, others that they want to extract \"fines\" for the land's corrupt sale (a hefty payoff to the state to maintain the status quo). </p> <p>The more cynical maintain that the government is anxious to get its hands on better dacha plots for its new top officials. </p> <p>The effort to reclaim these highly desirable stretches of countryside has even reached the top of Moscow society. Alla Pugachova - a Russian blend of Cilla Black and Cher - is being investigated because her dacha may have violated laws about building near a riverbank. </p> <p>Former president Boris Yeltsin has even been implicated in the dubious acquisition of land for a dacha. </p> <p>The Moscow prosecutor claims that the Kremlin kingmaker Boris Berezovsky, who now lives with political asylum in London, got 14 hectares of land in 1999 for his daughter by \"abusing his authority\". Mr Berezovsky says Mr Yeltsin gave him the land by decree, and the Kremlin is trying to get at him and the ex-president. </p> <p>As usual in Russia, a larger power struggle is at play. And, as usual, it claims a few innocent bystanders - even if it is only a small house and a dead parrot.</p>",
  "Radical Islamist propaganda calling on Afghans to join a global jihad against \"oil-thieving Christian crusaders\" has begun appearing in Afghanistan, signalling an attempt by foreign militants to stoke an Iraqi-style insurgency. <p>A glossy colour poster juxtaposes photos of charred American corpses swinging from a bridge in Falluja with that of a US soldier apparently frisking a burka-wearing Afghan woman. </p> <p>A DVD links gory footage of Taliban operations in Afghanistan, violence in Indonesia and the beheading of American businessman Nicholas Berg in Baghdad. </p> <p>The propaganda has been discreetly distributed in the run-up to today's presidential election, which pits the US-supported interim president Hamid Karzai against 15 challengers. </p> <p>\"This is a significant migration of tactics.

Human rights groups warn of intimidation by warlords who still control much of the country. Several candidates, such as former minister Yunus Qanooni, have informal links with armed groups.

  "Slaves found oil deep in the forests of the tiny west African island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 more than 200 years ago. In recent times, a company surveyed the bubbling pools of crude with a view to exploiting it, but concluded it was not possible. What the locals call the \"petrol mine\" near Uba Budo is now a rarely visited geological curiosity; for a few dollars, children will lead you down a slithery path to collect a bottle full of the \"black gold\" that drives the world. <p>Two hours' drive away, in the capital, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 city - a dozy, delightful place of a few thousand people where not much works - the smell of oil is becoming all-pervasive. A far more rewarding source has been discovered than the muddy hollow at Uba Budo. Three years ago, the world's largest oil company, ExxonMobil, found vast offshore deposits reckoned to be between 4bn and 10bn barrels. The first contracts have been awarded, and sooner or later the first $100m down payment will be paid to one of the most impoverished and indebted countries in the world. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, coupled with the even smaller island of Principe, straddling the equator, has won the geological lottery: a state the size of the Isle of Wight, with a population of just 150,000, could soon become the Qatar or Kuwait of Africa. Its people, mainly dirt-poor subsistence farmers, will theoretically be worth millions of dollars each within a generation. The interest alone on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's expected oil finds in a few years should repair its diabolical roads, pay off its $300m debt, wipe out its rampant malaria and rebuild its decrepit schools and hospitals. There could be so much money that no S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an need ever work again. </p> <p>In theory. But all leading economists know that when a poor country finds oil, it is more often a curse than a blessing. The history of all the other oil-producing countries in the region - Nigeria, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Congo, Chad, Cameroon - shows that sudden petro-wealth can swamp a poor country, rip apart its culture, divide its people, destabilise its governments, lead to massive corruption and human rights abuses, encourage coups and militarisation, and wreck the environment. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, a palm-fringed tropical island, is now a test case for oil companies and the world: will it be plundered and overwhelmed by the changes about to happen? Or could it, as many of the world's top economic and social advisers hope, avoid the paradox of plenty, become the only small, undeveloped country ever to have found oil in large quantities, shared the benefits equitably and guaranteed future generations sustainable development? </p> <p>To see what can happen when oil comes to a small nation, head to Malabo, the capital of only slightly larger Equatorial Guinea, which lies 300 miles to the north-east of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, close to Nigeria. Ten years ago, ExxonMobil found vast quantities of oil and gas in its waters, just as it has now done in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9. Tiny Equatorial Guinea, split between the island of Santa Isabella - the former Spanish colony of Fernando Po - and a strip of mainland west Africa, now produces 440,000 barrels of oil a day, almost half the yield of Nigeria; within five years it will probably be Africa's second largest oil and gas producer, and one of America's largest providers. </p> <p>On one level, oil has been good for Equatorial Guinea. ExxonMobil, US oil giant Marathon and others have invested more than $3bn in a country of about 500,000 people. The average income is said to have grown to $5,000 a head from less than $500, the economy is growing by 65% a year - faster than anywhere else in the world - and the country has paid off its crippling $200m international debt. According to the International Monetary Fund, its income from oil and gas is about $1bn a year, but this is based on 1992 oil prices and output. It's more likely that Equatorial Guinea is currently earning $3bn a year from oil. </p> <p>This kind of wealth makes a little known, globally insignificant nation a target for every kind of investor, entrepreneur, political opportunist and freebooter. Oil has brought attempted coups, massive corruption, xenophobia and paranoia. There have been frequent coup attempts in Equatorial Guinea, but the most serious was last March, when 25 men, including South Africans and Germans, were arrested in Malabo for allegedly plotting to overthrow the president. The next day, a further 70 men, including Old Etonian Simon Mann, were arrested on a plane at Harare airport in Zimbabwe, en route, it was claimed, to Equatorial Guinea from South Africa. The men said they were going to act as guards for a mining company in the Democratic Republic of Congo. </p> <p>The government's theory, pieced together from prisoner statements, is that the two groups were going to meet in Malabo, kill the president and secure the city to allow an exiled Equatorial Guinean living in Spain to be installed as president. To add to the intrigue, the Spanish government and US officials are said to have known of the plot in advance. Sir Mark Thatcher has been detained in Cape Town pending another court hearing into whether he invested money in the coup attempt. Meanwhile, the men held in Zimbabwe have been tried for arms offences and been given sentences ranging from one to seven years. The trial of those arrested in Malabo is expected to re-open on Monday. </p> <p>Equatorial Guinea was a Spanish colony until 1968. After independence, a Marxist government held power until 1979 when Teodoro Obiang Nguema overthrew his uncle in a coup. Obiang has retained absolute power since presiding over his country's spectacular access to wealth. He has a reputation for a brutal way with political opponents, and from the evidence of a visit, he has done nothing to share out the oil riches fairly. </p> <p>Oil is changing Malabo fast. A new dual carriageway leads from a new airport into the capital, where new hotels are being built and glass-walled office blocks are springing up. But the city centre is quiet, edgy and almost empty. Within an hour of arrival in this strange little country without bookshops or tourists, two spies eavesdropped our conversation in a hotel, we were followed in the street by the army, special police and national police, informed on by a man standing at a corner, stopped at gunpoint, asked for our papers, and had a film confiscated. </p> <p>\"Who are you? Why are you here? Where is your permission? Nobody takes pictures here,\" shouted the nervous kid in fatigues waving his gun. </p> <p>The head of the UN development programme in Equatorial Guinea, Bacar Abdouroihamane, warned us, \"Beware, this place, it's dangerous. It is very extreme, a place of nightmares and miracles. Two years ago they only had a few hundred cars, no airport, nothing. Now there are some very full bank accounts. They have 50 ministers and 25 presidential advisers. They have been kept in deep poverty for 200 years. Now oil comes, they see light at the end of the tunnel. But the companies do not care what happens. Equatorial Guinea has the worst mosquitoes and malaria in the world, there is appalling poverty and many shadow places that no one wants you to see.\" </p> <p>That evening, sitting in the eerie orange light of \"the eternal flame\" - the gas-flaring from Marathon Oil's giant $1.8bn methane works being constructed outside Malabo - we met Madame Lucie Bourthemieux, a Paris-based Cameroonian lawyer acting as an adviser to the minister of justice. Mme Lucie was keen to defend the regime. \"There is a deep distrust of foreign powers here,\" she said. \"The president has a hatred of, almost an allergy to, the west, especially to Spain, which treated the country like dirt as a colony. It was left at independence with nothing, and run by a Marxist dictator until he took over. Democracy is young here. It may not actually be the most suitable method of politics. The president says that God wants him to build the country. He is sincere, very Catholic. He knows what poverty is, what it is to have no light or water.\" </p> <p>Equatorial Guinea, she said, had been ripped off by US oil companies from the moment oil was discovered. \"The companies struck a deal that left it with just 15% of the oil revenues. The president could do nothing. They took the lion's share. In front of the lion, what can the rabbit do? The lawyers involved in signing the first contracts were supposed to advise the country, but were working for the Americans. Today, if America doesn't like a president, it takes him out.\" The second problem, she said, was that oil had made Equatorial Guinea strategically important. \"It's now in the interests of many countries to try to destabilise us. We have no friends. Until oil came, no one was interested in us. Now everyone wants to steal our wealth.\" Equatorial Guinea's enemies, she said, were waging an intense propaganda war, spreading rumours and libels about the president. </p> <p>Over the next three days, Mme Lucie interrogated us regularly and had Guardian articles about the president sent to her from Paris. She objected strongly to reports from watchdog groups in Europe and the US that Obiang had profited handsomely from oil at the expense of human rights and the poor, and was furious that a political exile had been allowed to say that the president was \"a cannibal\" who \"eats human testicles\". \"How can the Guardian write that? It is so demeaning and insulting to an African head of state. You could never ever say that about Mr Blair,\" she thundered. </p> <p>\"This is a good place. You are welcome to talk to people,\" she said. But Malabo is almost the only city in Africa where no one, not even the children, want to talk and where people look around in fear or just walk away when you speak to them. By chance, we met Charles, a young man who was as anxious to show us Malabo as he was to leave it. </p> <p>We started the reality tour on the new motorway. \"The president and his family own all the land on either side for miles. That enormous house is the president's wife's hotel ... that's his brother-in-law's house ... this is his third son's ... this is the nephew's ... that is the house of his first wife,\" he said. Indeed, every new building of any size seemed to belong to the president or his family. </p> <p>All the US companies - ExxonMobil, Marathon, Halliburton, Chevron, Total - had refused to meet or talk to us, but we got to within 300 yards of some of their huge complexes, all built on more land owned by the president. Here we were stopped by armed guards demanding bribes. We turned back, past the golf course hacked out of virgin forest also owned by the president; the prefab city built by multinational Bechtel for the 4,000 Filipino construction workers shipped in to build Marathon's plant; the village flattened without compensation to make way for the companies; and the fortified ExxonMobil compound with its guardhouses, tennis courts, cinemas and canteens where even the tomatoes are flown in from America. </p> <p>\"The president and his family own everything. They earn many millions a year from the land he rents to the oil companies. The money goes straight out of the country. It's paid in dollars straight into secret accounts,\" said Charles. </p> <p>\"This is what oil brings,\" he continued as we drove past rows of new $1m houses built for oil executives, and huge houses bristling with satellite and radio masts lived in by ministers, government advisers and security chiefs. We headed up Chester E Norris Jnr avenue, an American-style suburb named after a US ambassador who was pulled out of Malabo in 1988. Less wealthy expats live here with their barbecues and basketball nets behind high fences. </p> <p>\"Now see how Equatorial Guineans live,\" said Charles. He headed to Newbuildings, an ocean of wooden shacks where about 30,000 people live in some of Africa's worst slums. There were six foot-high rubbish mountains, ponds of standing water infested with mosquitoes, broken drains and water pipes. \"Most people live without electricity. There is no sanitation. People are living in rubbish dumps. Everything is fucked here. We were promised a better world with oil, but we have nothing and now we live only in fear,\" said Charles. \"They have done nothing for health or for schools. The president and his family have all the money, the opportunities and the power. All power leads to him. He makes all the decisions. One family only lives well here.\" </p> <p>We continued the tour of downtown Malabo. \"This is where the prostitutes from Cameroon and Gambia have come to live. Oil has brought many bad people, bandits. This area was burned down twice this year ... People say that the ministers and the oilworkers brought Aids. There are many bars in the city for expats to pick up girls. Before, we were poor. Now, we are poor and raped,\" said Charles. \"Duck your head now. We must be careful no one sees you here .. People are afraid to talk. All we see now is more police and army. Petrol has brought only problems. Since it came, rents have more than doubled. All prices have risen.\" As he spoke, Obiang's two personal military helicopters flew overhead towards the airport. </p> <p>We asked to see the hospital, which was clean, orderly, staffed mostly by Cuban doctors. The hospital had a new wing and the babies slept under mosquito nets stamped with the ExxonMobil logo. Very quickly staff asked us to leave. That evening, however, we went back with 15-year-old Rico, whom we'd met in the street. He needed to have a festering wound on his thigh treated. We took him to the new wing where he was assessed by a doctor, treated and given antibiotics in less than 30 minutes for $3. </p> <p>\"But my family has nothing,\" said Rico, leading us to his house, a six foot-square wooden shed which he shared with his mother, baby sister and brother. None of the families in the large compound wanted to talk or have their picture taken. That evening a policeman followed us back to our hotel, sat down beside us and pointedly fiddled with his gun. </p> <p>For Anglo-Cameroonian businessman Patrick, the country is a nightmare place to work. \"Oil has made Equatorial Guinea a family business with 500,000 employees. Every business here must release a percentage of the company or pay a bribe, or both, to the president or one of his family. That generates huge amounts of dosh. It all goes straight offshore. You can do nothing without presidential support. The president has 17 children and the oldest drives a red Ferrari. The government demands that companies who come here build the roads or whatever. The country has been badly treated by everyone for years, so it's payback time now.\" He adds that 20 years ago Equatorial Guinea was so poor that it offered itself to neighbouring Cameroon for $1m. Cameroon refused. </p> <p>Political opposition has been muted and depressed since the recent elections overwhelmingly returned the government. There is notionally an opposition party, but Pio-Miguel Obama, general secretary of the socialist CPDS party, didn't want to be seen with us in public and said that, like many of his party, he had been in prison and tortured. </p> <p>\"This country is very rich now, but everything is concentrated to benefit the power of the president. No one knows how much oil money is coming in, not even the finance minister. It is not in the budget. The oil money goes to the president's accounts in Europe and the US. ExxonMobil is accused in the US of having paid $400m into his private account, but the company gives no information. </p> <p>\"They said that oil would bring jobs, but it's impossible to get a job with the companies. They employ only a few hundred people - the rest are temporary workers from the Philippines. The companies provide only a few mattresses, nets and beds for the hospital. Meanwhile, there is a huge network of spies who are paid to inform on people. Everyone here is a policeman.\" </p> <p>Two days later, having been refused interviews by the ministers of information, justice, security and tourism, we tried to leave but were dragged back from the airport departure lounge by a flustered Mme Lucie. \"You must not go,\" she implored us. \"The president knows you are here. He has ordered his personal political adviser, the man whom he is closest to, and the minister of justice, to meet you. It would be very unwise to leave.\" </p> <p>Their Excellencies Miguel Oyono Ndong Mifuno and Dr Ruben Maye Nsue were both angry. Both were relations of the president. Obiang's right-hand man dripped with gold, while Dr Nsue, the justice minister, educated in France, Spain and Geneva, was young, smart and charming. \"Why are you here?\" demanded Mifuno. \"Are you here to destabilise the country? Our security investigations say that you are engaged in an operation to discredit the country. Who is behind this? We have our ideas. You must apologise for your past mistakes.\" </p> <p>He added, more calmly: \"Oil here is a political resource. When we had none, no one was interested in us. Now everyone comes to take advantage of us. Our enemies say that the oil money goes only to the president. That is vulgar talk. What I know is that people here - everyone - has money or the facility to build his own house, or look for work. There are no secret or private accounts. Everything is accountable.\" </p> <p>He said that oil has brought global companies flocking to Malabo. \"They want to steal our wealth. They demand a percentage share of the oil. We say no. They want to build an airport the size of Frankfurt, we say no. They say that they want to make us a gift of sanitation and water, but it is not a gift. They want to build a new port, but they demand $200m to do the feasibility studies, so we say no ... We do not want five-star hotels. We only want development that is suitable for our people. I know the president well. He wants the best for his people. Soon Malabo 2 [a new administrative capital] will be built. Ten thousand houses will be built for the people.\" </p> <p>Q: Will they be given to poor people? </p> <p>A: No, they must buy them. </p> <p>Q: How? </p> <p>A: Everyone has money. </p> <p>Q: How much does the country earn from oil? </p> <p>A: You should ask the IMF. </p> <p>Q: What is your annual budget? </p> <p>A: [He telephones the minister of finance before answering.] $1bn. </p> <p>Q: How much is spent on health and education? </p> <p>A: 40% of the budget - $400m a year. </p> <p>Q: How much does the president and his family take from oil. What about his mansions in America? </p> <p>A: That is not an issue. </p> <p>But it is. The next day, the Washington Post reported that Riggs Bank in New York had agreed to pay $25m in fines for what US regulators called a \"wilful, systemic\" violation of anti-money-laundering laws. Regulators said the bank failed to report \"clearly suspicious transactions\", particularly ones connected to the embassy of Equatorial Guinea. </p> <p>In Malabo, it was President Obiang's 62nd birthday. The country's elite, about 100 people, went by Mercedes, Toyota and Buick to the cathedral. Obiang arrived last in a 12-car convoy of police and army vehicles from his palace 500 yards away. Six bodyguards ran alongside it holding handguns. No one else in Malabo was allowed within 300 yards. </p> <p>\"When people smell oil, they delude themselves. They go mad,\" said Patrick as we said goodbye. </p> <p>Oil financed 30 years of civil war in Angola. At least $30bn of oil money has been squandered or stolen in Nigeria and the Niger delta region, where it is found, is close to anarchy. In Chad, Cameroon and the Republic of Congo, oil money has led directly to governmental corruption, electoral fraud, environmental destruction, financial mismanagement and human rights abuses. Can tiny S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe do any better? </p> <p>The capital, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 city, has the pace and feel of a Caribbean island 30 years ago. Just three years ago it was neglected and broke. There were about 50 cars on the whole island and just one flight a week to the capital. The budget for the country was $25m a year - a quarter of the turnover of a London supermarket - and anyone who wanted to see the president could walk into the down-at-heel palace. Aid made up 80% of the country's income, it owed $300m and its economy was dictated by harsh IMF structural adjustment programmes. </p> <p>Not much has changed. The palace now has three guards, but chickens run around its grounds. The one TV channel regularly closes down because it cannot get spare parts. The power goes off most nights, there is no daily newspaper and goats walk the streets. The only token of the global economy is a Visa cash machine. However, there are many more cars, daily flights to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 from Europe - and a lot of smart lawyers, businessmen and soldiers in town. </p> <p>\"Oil will change everything very soon,\" says Colonel Eugene Michael Mensch, president of Consulting Africa Ltd, a recently retired US marine sent to conduct seminars on military/civilian relations with the government. He is part of an advance guard of Americans now regularly in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 to prepare it for the changes that oil and America demand. </p> <p>America's unstated but emerging policy is to turn S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 into a strategic regional base to protect its growing oil interests in the Gulf of Guinea. The region has an estimated 50bn barrels of oil reserves, and within 10 years is expected to provide 25% of US oil, more even than the Middle East. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is ideal. Unlike Equatorial Guinea, which the US State Department has labelled \"ruthless\" for its torture and incarceration of the opposition, it has a pro-west president, few people, a large Voice of America radio station and no anti-Americanism. </p> <p>To underline S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's new strategic importance, a full US military exercise was staged in its waters during the summer. Washington is paying $900m for feasibility studies on a new airport able to take the largest military aircraft, as well as a deep sea port large enough for its warships. Under the terms of the contract, both will have to be built by American companies. </p> <p>The US has other plans for S\u00e3o Tome. \"They've got 350 people in the army and no coastal defences. They don't know what is going on, or who is coming in, but oil money will bring drugs and illegal immigration. They're not at the point where they know if they need an air force. If you take the cynical view, you would say that the US is in it for the money, but we want to help them, too. They need to be ready,\" says the US military attach\u00e9 in Gabon. There are others wanting a stake in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, too. Brazil, France, South Africa, Nigeria, Portugal and Angola have all recently offered to \"help\" train and bankroll its army, police and coastguards. </p> <p>The international community was not there to lend a hand, however, when S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 made its most crucial decision: in 1997, an unknown, Houston-based Nigerian company called ERHC, which had never drilled a barrel of oil, offered just $5m for - and got - exclusive exploration rights to all S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's waters. It was described as one of the best - or worst - deals in history, and the World Bank declared it unfair. But no money was paid and the deal looked set to fall apart until Sir Emeka Offor, a Nigerian businessman closely associated with the late Nigerian dictator Sami Abacha - who stole an estimated $4bn when in power - bought ERHC, renamed it Chrome, brought in ExxonMobil, involved the Nigerian government and proposed a new agreement in return for lucrative concession rights. When Exxon struck oil, Chrome/ERHC became worth about $600m overnight. Nigeria then disputed S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's territorial limits. Fearing it would lose everything, desperate for cash, the then president caved in and agreed a 60:40 split in Nigeria's favour. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Chrome/ERHC and Exxon also negotiated preferential rights. By the time the first licences were bid for last November, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 had effectively given away much of its oil-rich territory, handed a barely existent Nigerian company almost 20% of what was left, and given up most of its rights to down payments. However, November 23 2003 was still the greatest day in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's uneventful history. Twenty companies bid a combined $506m for seven exploration blocks, leading the government to expect more than $200m in signature payments. So far, only one contract has been awarded, to ChevronTexaco. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9ans are now realising that they will see next to no money for many years. The first boreholes will be drilled next year, but the companies say oil will not flow until 2011. In another controversial deal, the companies negotiated the right to recoup their investments first, receiving 80% of all the oil money for the first five years of production. In other words, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 stands to make only 20% of a 40% share (8%) between 2011 and 2017. </p> <p>No one, least of all Fradique de Menezes, the half-Portuguese cocoa trader elected president in 2001, doubts that S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 will one day become rich. Fradique, as he is known everywhere, says that the country will get at least $500m a year from oil, more than 10 times its present annual income. But he, too, is accused of lining his pockets. On taking power, he was found to have secretly accepted $100,000 from EHRC/Chrome's chairman. Both parties said it was a legitimate election contribution. </p> <p>Fradique has had a torrid year. Last June he was flown to Washington to sit at President Bush's right hand with other African oil state leaders. Shortly after, while in Nigeria, he was ousted in a short bloodless coup by a small army group, backed by the \"Buffalo boys\" - S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an mercenaries who fought with the apartheid regime in South Africa. Eventually Nigeria negotiated a deal whereby the organisers of the coup agreed to hand back the islands on the promise of better conditions for the army. Oil may not have been the prime reason for the coup, but no one doubts it was in the background. </p> <p>\"I am optimistic but very afraid,\" says Chr\u00e9tien Lehombre, of the UN development programme that is trying to help S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 prepare for oil. According to a new UN report, unless the country prepares rapidly, it is certain to suffer \"resource curse\". This is a feature of all poor countries that depend for their income largely on one resource - be it diamonds, gold, timber, oil or gas, cacao or copper. </p> <p>Seven things usually happen when oil comes to a poor country, says the report. Prices rise; the government loses interest in everything else; officials become corrupt; multinational companies reward individuals via secret accounts; there is increased military spending; democracy is undermined; and prestige white elephant projects get built. </p> <p>\"Spending the money wisely is the biggest challenge S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 will ever face,\" says Lehombre. \"So many mistakes have been made already in the initial contracts.\" In some ways, says Lehombre, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is enlightened. Last year the government hired experts from Alaska to advise on how to deal with windfall oil money and a UN special adviser has been working with young economists at Columbia university to draw up a model oil law, which, if passed, will ensure that neither government nor president can squander or steal the oil money. \"The broad principles have been agreed by parliament,\" says Lehombre. </p> <p>According to others who have seen the draft law, it also states that the government can increase annual spending by only 20% a year, with the amount it takes from the oil fund dropping 2% a year until, after 10 years, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 must live on the interest alone - expected to be at least $50m a year. One anomaly is that Principe, with only 5,000 people, is to get 10% of the money, the equivalent of an English village having several billion pounds in the bank and earning at least $5m a year. </p> <p>The fear is that President de Menezes will refuse to sign up. Last year, parliament tried to change the constitution to reduce his powers. He dismissed parliament. \"The law will limit the risks, and the amount that can be injected into the economy, but then look at all the aid that has come to the country in the past 20 years. Officially, it was $30-35m a year. Where did that go? That's the reality check,\" says Lehombre. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the vast majority of rural S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9ans barely believe there is life beyond the plantations. The island was a Portuguese colony until 1975 and the prime source of income has always been cocoa. \"I just don't know if oil will bring a better life than this,\" says Ricardo Toakares, who lives in the crumbling, colonnaded grandeur of the old Mille Flores cocoa estate. More than 100 families live in its marble-floored rooms, stables, workshops and kitchens. There are fires on the balconies, dogs on the verandas and what once must have been lawns are covered in washing. </p> <p>\"We have very little money. We live on bananas and cocoa, and sell fruit to the town. There's not enough food, we need to repair the school and we need houses and work. The malaria here is terrible. A doctor comes every Tuesday but we have no drugs. It all depends on the government. Maybe things will change. After all, we do not need very much, just decent jobs and a better standard of life. It could be wonderful here. But we have a saying: 'The president drinks with a cup, the rich with a spoon and the poor with a fork.'\" </p> <p>The S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 elite already has grand ideas. \"I see S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 as a Singapore or a Hong Kong,\" says businessman Tony Aguire, who chairs the committee set up to manage the new airport and port studies. \"We see it setting up a free trade zone, becoming a transit and storage place for the region, with shops, hotels, duty-free zones for oilworkers, providing logistical support for the oil companies, a private healthcare centre for rich people in the region ...\" </p> <p>Carlos Tiny, a former presidential candidate, gives his verdict: \"It will be heaven, hell or purgatory, depending on the choices made.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Pete Doherty first started moonlighting from the Libertines with Babyshambles the result was just that: an inept, childish scrawl of what a band might be. It seemed obvious that without Carl Barat as foil and spur, Doherty's muse could only wreak a hollow kind of havoc. </p> <p>All of which makes tonight some kind of miracle. Doherty is a star - here's a novelty - by virtue of innate charisma, a force of feral intensity and hypnotic otherness. It's a force, you sense, that he can't always control, it batters him this way and that but, for now, it's as if he's realised he must stop messing about. The new look Babyshambles are muscular and tight in a way the Libertines - a tense, nervy and notoriously unreliable live band - have yet to master. There are marvellous new songs, too. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, much of what was great about the Libertines is here too: the ferocious energy, the elegant lyricism, the way the band recall the Smiths without ever sounding like wan Smith copyists. In Fuck Forever they have crafted a future anthem, a peculiarly English echo of Smells Like Teen Spirit that is monumental. </p> <p>What a pity, then, that a third of the show is ruined by the appearance of inveterate scenester Dot Allison, who may or may not be Doherty's new girlfriend, fresh from droning through the Liz Fraser parts on tour with a somewhat hobbled Massive Attack. (She has already been dubbed Yoko Ono; in truth she has a fraction of Ono's talent.) Let loose on songs both old and new, she sings like a tone-deaf schoolgirl and plays the glockenspiel with all soullessness that can be telegraphed through a stick and a strip of metal. </p> <p>Still, someone living as hard as Doherty will make as many bad choices as good - as anyone who's hitched themselves to his wagon knows already. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> At Coronet, London, on October 15.

  "A traditionalist bishop from the Church of England heightened the rhetoric against making women bishops yesterday by accusing its supporters of being tyrannical extremists wishing to impose Stalinist thought-control on those in the pews. <p>With supporters and opponents of women's ordination limbering up in advance of a report outlining the options, the Rt Rev John Broadhurst, suffragan Bishop of Fulham, referred to those who disagree with him as enemies. </p> <p>As if the church does not have enough problems with the issue of gay priests and with a working party due to report on the future shape of the Anglican communion on October 18, the church of England plans to publish a nearly equally contentious report on women bishops two days later. </p> <p>Bishop Broadhurst made his remarks as Forward in Faith, the traditionalist pressure group opposed to women priests, issued a book demanding that if women are further promoted, opponents should be allowed to set up their own province with a presiding bishop parallel to the archbishops of Canterbury and York. </p> <p>He said: \"There is a lot of goodwill within the Church of England, but there are those who are enemies, who would like to see us exterminated. It is Stalinist thought-control. A Christian who wants to abolish the conscience of another Christian is a fraud. They are tyrannical extremists.\" </p> <p>Both sides believe they have been victimised by their opponents. Women clergy say they have been harassed and even spat upon by men. Members of Forward in Faith say they have also been subjected to abuse. </p> <p>Although the church began ordaining women to the priesthood a decade ago, it did not allow them to be promoted to bishops. </p> <p>The forthcoming report of a three year-long working party headed by the Rt Rev Michael Nazir-Ali, Bishop of Rochester, is expected to suggest a range of options for still further consideration, including allowing suitable female candidates to proceed to suffragan or diocesan appointments but still excluding them from the highest office, that of archbishop. </p> <p>It also suggests permitting those opposed to women's ordination altogether to set up a third province, which is what Forward in Faith now wants. </p> <p>Bishop Broadhurst said a substantial group of current bishops would support the move. He said: \"We could not and would not accept [women bishops]. There are a lot of people for whom this would be a bridge too far.\" </p> <p>Some Anglo-Catholics oppose women's ordination because they believe it flies in the face of church tradition and that women are not capable of being priests, while some Evangelicals argue such a move has no Biblical sanction and scripture lays down that women should have no leadership role in any organisation, including the family. </p> <p>It has even been claimed that women can no more be ordained than a pork pie can. </p> <p>There are already women bishops in some parts of the Anglican communion, notably the US, Canada and New Zealand, but large parts of the church, especially in the developing world, still do not ordain women at all. The Australian church earlier this week voted narrowly against allowing its women clergy to become bishops. </p> <p>A book by supporters of women's ordination to be published next week accuses opponents of prejudice. In The Call for Women Bishops, Marilyn McCord Adams, regius professor of divinity at Oxford, argues: \"Continued hesitations and reservations about making women bishops legal ... all send the message that the church is still vice-gripped by misogyny, that it still respects rather than contradicts the underlying feeling that men cannot be as big as they need to be unless women are made to seem smaller than they really are.\"</p>",
  "I hardly ever see stray dogs these days; on the odd occasion when I've encountered an unescorted pooch, it's already attracted the attention of a clutch of concerned citizens. A dog tag is the safest bet for a happy reunion should your pet get lost, but what is the responsible member of the public supposed to do with a dog without a collar, or one that's so frightened (or frightening) no one can get near it? <p>A lot of people seem to expect the RSPCA to arrive at the scene of an abandoned mutt with fire service speed, but the reality is that even the RSPCA doesn't have the resources to run a 24-hour nationwide animal collection service and can deal only with emergencies. If you can take the dog to an animal shelter yourself, that's all well and good (Battersea Dogs Home accepts stray cats and dogs day and night, but not all centres have 24-hour facilities). </p> <p>Responsibility for stray dogs actually lies with local authorities, but people tend to turn to charities first because they fear the council dog warden will only sentence the unfortunate creature to death row. </p> <p>According to a Dogs Trust survey, nearly 10,000 stray dogs were destroyed by local authorities in the UK last year - that's one dog killed every hour. Local authorities have a duty under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act to appoint an officer responsible for controlling stray dogs; animals that are not claimed within seven days may be destroyed. Dog wardens exist primarily to protect the public from dogs, not the other way round, but that doesn't mean they are Cruella De Vil's foot soldiers. </p> <p>Obviously, it would be better for all concerned if there weren't any strays in the first place, so dog wardens are increasingly working to promote responsible dog ownership. </p> <p>Local authority animal control services are patchy and vary considerably from region to region. Middlesbrough Council hasn't put a healthy dog to sleep for 18 months. </p> <p>Environmental protection manager Paul Robertson has adopted a strategy designed to enhance public safety as well as improve dog welfare: \"The streets of Middlesbrough are a lot better as a result of the work we've been doing.\" Rather than putting a dog down, the council will hand it over to a rehoming centre, along with the \u00a320 saved. Meanwhile, dog wardens have been working with Dogs Trust to run subsidised neutering and microchipping schemes. </p> <p>Less rosy are the figures from Northern Ireland, which accounts for 40% of all dogs destroyed by local authorities in the UK (nearly 4,000 compared with only 143 in London). Ronnie Milsop, Dogs Trust Northern Ireland campaigns officer, has been working with vets, local councils, housing authorities and schools to get the message across that owners should get their dogs neutered and not allow them to roam. He says the stray population is beginning to fall and prevention is the key. \"Once the dog gets into the pound, we're being reactive. We need to be proactive to stop it from getting there.\" </p> <p>Northern Ireland has more than its fair share of unneutered \"latchkey\" dogs. \"A lot of people think that if a dog is wandering about the housing estate, it isn't a stray,\" explains Milsop. These free-roamers produce masses of puppies and can be a nuisance. They are common in areas of high unemployment - which is why Dogs Trust will neuter dogs for as little as \u00a310 if the owners live on benefit in a target region. </p> <p>More than 100,000 stray dogs were collected by local authorities last year but, thanks to cooperation between dog wardens, rehoming organisations and the public, most of these were reunited with their owners or successfully rehomed. </p> <p>If we keep this up, I may never see a stray dog again. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:GuardianPets@aol.com\">GuardianPets@aol.com</a></p>",
  "The Republican and Democratic parties are massing armies of lawyers to fight for every vote in case next month's US election becomes a repeat of the 2000 debacle in Florida. <p>The court cases have already started more than three weeks before polling day. The Democrats have taken Florida's Republican secretary of state, Glenda Hood, to court twice this week, accusing her of putting up obstacles to first-time voters. </p> <p>One issue at stake is a tiny box on the Florida registration form which the potential voter is supposed to tick to confirm that he or she is a US citizen. Democrats say the box is redundant as the voter is also required to sign a statement stating US citizenship. But Ms Hood has told election officials to reject forms on which the box is not ticked. </p> <p>She was also taken to court yesterday for restricting provisional voting - in which the voter's registration has to be confirmed after the ballot - to the elector's home district. </p> <p>These are the opening skirmishes in what is likely to be a fierce and prolonged legal battle that will rumble on until the election on November and beyond if the results are close. </p> <p>\"It is quite possible we will not know the result of this election on November 3,\" said Robert Boorstin, a former aide to Bill Clinton and a political analyst at the pro-Democratic Centre for American Progress. </p> <p>This week, the Democrats announced the formation of a legal task force ready for rapid deployment to swing states where the vote may be contested. As part of its 2004 Voter Protection Programme, the task force has a contact list of thousands of volunteer lawyers and a coordinator in each of the 23 states where the result may be close. The Republicans have assembled a similar army, targeting 30,000 voter precincts in 17 states. </p> <p>Both sides are setting up legal command centres and have prepared paperwork so they can mount rapid challenges to polling improprieties. In general terms, the Democratic pre-election legal effort is aimed at maximising turnout, particularly among black voters and immigrants. Republican lawyers focus more on combating suspected voter fraud, and insisting that the rules are upheld. </p> <p>This has frequently led to charges that the Republicans and the state governments they control are trying to suppress the minority vote. The Florida police have toured poor neighbourhoods, checking identity documents, in what Democrats say is an attempt to intimidate would-be voters. </p> <p>The arguments have raised ghosts of the 2000 vote, in which a disproportionate number of black Floridian voters were disqualified over technicalities, and some said they were discouraged by the presence of police checkpoints near polling stations. </p> <p>One of the stranger episodes of the past month was an attempt by Ohio's Republican secretary of state, Kenneth Blackwell, to disqualify thousands of registration forms in Democratic districts of Cleveland because they were not printed on thick enough card. He was forced to withdraw the ruling amid public uproar. </p> <p>Harold Meyerson, a liberal columnist, wrote in the Washington Post: \"While US troops are fighting and dying to bring the vote to Samarra [in Iraq], their families may be struggling to hang on to the franchise here at home. </p> <p>\"And even as those soldiers are strapping on their body armour to bring the vote to Sadr City, back home - in Florida, Ohio, New Mexico and other battleground states - Republican election officials are working to reduce the number of black and Latino voters.\" </p> <p>The Republicans have insisted they are concerned only with fraud and are just as keen as the Democrats to promote a high turnout. \"We will fight any effort to suppress votes,\" JC Watts, a black Republican congressman from Oklahoma told the Cox news agency. </p> <p>On election day, legal attention is likely to shift to voting methods. Florida has a new computer system which, critics say, can easily be hacked into. </p> <p>Two-thirds of Ohio voters, meanwhile, will use the punch-card ballots that caused trouble in Florida four years ago. If the presidency rests on a close vote there, both sides could once again be quarrelling over \"hanging\" and \"pregnant\" chads.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Bishop TD Jakes</strong> is a bigger movie star than <strong>Taye Diggs</strong>. The Bish, a real-life preacher, plays himself in <strong>Woman, Thou Art Loosed</strong>, a micro-budget morality saga based on his experiences ministering to the female denizens of death row, which is currently the fifth biggest box-office grosser in America. Obviously, Taye Diggs is a better and busier actor than Bishop TD Jakes, but what he's been lacking thus far in his career is a role specifically tailored to his particular talents. There's a warm welcome in Hollywood for black actors who are good with a gun or a gag, or who can convey gravity, wisdom and, like TD, spiritual uplift. But there's no room at the inn for a black Cary Grant. In an almost karmic rebuke to his hideously unfair allocations of charm and charisma, Diggs - the mere mention of whose name causes teeming masses of American womanhood to raise the white flag - has spent the last few years toiling in projects that have actively undermined his God-given right to leading man status.</p> <p>But shed no more tears for the pretty boy, because fortune, in the shape of <strong>Mel Gibson's</strong> production company, stepped in with a cut-to-fit star vehicle. <strong>Kevin Hill</strong> - or, as I like to think of it, What's It All About, Alfie McBeal? - kicks off with Diggs' eponymous hero as cock of the walk: smooth, unencumbered womaniser by night, shark-like litigator by day. The carpet is yanked from under Kevin's Nikes before the first commercial break. His cousin has died, leaving his baby daughter alone in the world (her untrustworthy, crackhead, stripper mom having vanished). Kevin's FHM subscriber's dream life has no room for a squalling tot but then he takes one look at that wee helpless, trusting face and the rest is a heartwarming comedydrama.</p> <p>Hewing close to all the components of a David E Kelley quirky lawyer show, with the distinct advantage of not actually being a David E Kelley show, the suddenly baby-comes-first Kevin is swiftly ejected from his unfeeling patriarchy of a law firm (named, in perhaps too cute a shout-out, Davis, Dugan and Kelley) and forced to take up employment as the only male in an otherwise all-cute-chick company (naturally, one of the cute chick lawyers is a bitter recipient of a previous one-night stand). Where once Kevin represented the interests of rich guys, now he fights for the rights of underdog females whose pain he feels. And, of course, the fact that there's a little bundle of joy at home (and a wisecracking gay nanny) means that he can't be out trawling clubs for fresh prey which, in turn, makes him that much more attractive. </p> <p>There's not a moment in Kevin Hill that isn't entirely predictable (I'm already stocking up on Kleenex for the episode where crackhead stripper mom shows up and the ensuing tearjerking custody battle). There also isn't a moment that isn't completely enjoyable.</p> <p>Every time I write about HBO's grit-encrusted, Baltimore crime drama <strong>The Wire</strong>, with its bone-weary cops, slimy politicos and career drug-dealers, I end up talking about how stupid I am. I'm about to do it again. I responded to Kevin Hill because of its instant, untaxing familiarity. The Wire, now beginning its third non-smash season, requires work. You need to remember which drug dealer had a grudge against which other drug dealer midway through season one. You need to understand that most conversations between politicians and cops mean exactly the opposite of what's being said. You need, in other words, to pay attention, which is the exact opposite of what most TV requires.</p> <p>The cable king has many more successful series but, to my mind, The Wire is the one that justifies its existence. It gets no Emmy love, it has never built on its original hardcore constituency, it makes no attempt to bring rookie viewers up to speed with its multitudinous plotlines. Although not without humour, its outlook is almost entirely bleak. And HBO keeps on the air. This time, along with Brit-heavy cast (<strong>Dominic West</strong>, <strong>Aiden Gillen</strong> and <strong>Idris Elba</strong>), the show boasts the most prestigious writing staff on TV, with novelists <strong>Richard Price</strong>, <strong>George P Pelecanos</strong> and <strong>Denis Lehane</strong> joining creator David Simon and his group of Homicide vets. Which means this season, I'm going to feel really stupid ...</p>",
  "<p><strong>Saturday October 9</strong></p> <p><strong>What's New Pussycat?</strong> (Clive Donner, 1965) <br>1.15pm, ITV1</p> <p>Woody Allen was big in the New York nightclubs when he wrote the script for this silly comedy. His work was much mucked about, but some laughs remain in the story of womanising fashion mag editor Peter O'Toole heading for quack psychiatrist Peter Sellers's couch when he finds himself considering marriage. Woody also appears, along with more photogenic Romy Schneider, Capucine and Ursula Andress.</p> <p><strong>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</strong> (Tom Shadyac, 1993) <br>5.45pm, BBC1</p> <p>The one-time TV comic Jim Carrey whizzed into the superstar league with his dumb gumshoe of the title, a dab hand at tracking missing beasts and at impersonating Connery's Bond. He's on the case of the Miami Dolphins' missing mascot, a live dolphin, which must be returned before the start of the Super Bowl. With Sean Young and Courteney Cox.</p> <p><strong>Charlotte Gray</strong> (Gillian Armstrong, 2001) <br>9.10pm, C4</p> <p>Cate Blanchett is the heroine of the title and the best thing by a long way in this unconvincing adaptation of Sebastian Faulks's bestseller about wartime resistance. When her pilot-boyfriend (Rupert Penry-Jones) is shot down over France, Charlotte gets herself parachuted in as an undercover agent so that she can search for him. Her sabotage work with resistance man Billy Crudup is distinctly sub-Carve Her Name With Pride, but it's handsomely made and Blanchett's intensity dispels the suspicion that this is an upmarket 'Allo 'Allo.</p> <p><strong>The Rock</strong> (Michael Bay, 1996) <br>9.30pm, BBC1</p> <p>Utterly implausible, corny, but still irresistible Die Hard-style actioner: after all, it's got Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery and enough high explosive to make John Woo blanch. Mad-dog general Ed Harris, with the usual elite bunch of heavies, has taken over Alcatraz, made a gaggle of tourists prisoners, aimed missiles at San Francisco, and demanded a fortune in ransom. To foil the plot Connery - who once escaped the island - now has to break in, with FBI geek Cage for company. Send for the popcorn and enjoy.</p> <p><strong>Another 48 Hours</strong> (Walter Hill, 1990) <br>11.30pm, ITV1</p> <p>Predictable sequel that can't live up to the terrific 48 Hours. Nick Nolte's gravel-throated cop is again teamed with Eddie Murphy's loud-mouthed ex-con to tackle crime king the Iceman. But despite the fist-fights, shotguns and car chases, the two are simply going through the motions - albeit at 100mph.</p> <p><strong>What's Cooking?</strong> (Gurinder Chadha, 2000) <br>12.35am, C4</p> <p>Chadha serves up a rather bigger dish than her earlier Bhaji On The Beach: four of them, in fact, in a multicultural celebration of Thanksgiving. Set in LA, it has African-American, Jewish, Hispanic and Vietnamese familes preparing their respective feasts, the food liberally sprinkled with mixed emotional spices as they tackle a series of domestic crises. Entertaining, if a little worthy, with fine performances from the likes of Joan Chen, Julianna Margulies, Mercedes Ruehl, Kyra Sedgwick and Alfre Woodard.</p> <p><strong>Big Night</strong> (Stanley Tucci, 1996) <br>2.40am, C4</p> <p>More tasty cookery: the simple tale of brothers Primo and Secondo Pilaggi (Tony Shalhoub, director Tucci) struggling to make a success of their traditional Italian restaurant in 1950s New Jersey. Unfortunately, rival Pascal (Ian Holm) is making a killing down the road with a pretentious meatball nosherie ... A low-heat, but beautifully performed and life-affirming comedy.</p> <p><strong>Sunday October 10</strong></p> <p><strong>Cool Hand Luke</strong> (Stuart Rosenberg, 1967) <br>3.40pm, Five</p> <p>Paul Newman is on top form as the prisoner who maintains inner freedom despite the brutalities of a Deep South chain gang. Much in the style of the old Warner Bros melodramas, the hardnut action is lightened by a witty, funny streak - such as the much celebrated, Jackass-style egg-eating contest. Strother Martin is the vicious camp boss, while George Kennedy won an Oscar for his tough convict who comes to respect Luke.</p> <p><strong>Bill And Ted's Bogus Journey</strong> (Peter Hewitt, 1991) <br>6.25pm, Five</p> <p>Those lovably dopey dudes return in a sequel that's bigger and funnier than the original. Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are again the airheads, now terminated by robot-doppelgangers sent back from the future by evil Joss Ackland. Which is fine, because they get the chance to save mankind and play games with the Grim Reaper. He fancies chess, a la Bergman's The Seventh Seal; they prefer Battleships.</p> <p><strong>Sling Blade</strong> (Billy Bob Thornton, 1996) <br>10.30pm, BBC2</p> <p>The actor/writer Thornton's astonishing debut as director is about as leftfield as they come: the story of a mentally challenged Arkansas man (Thornton) finally released from psychiatric hospital after murdering his mother and her lover when he was 12 years old. He is befriended by a boy (Lucas Black) and his mother (Natalie Canerday), but new problems emerge. Beautifully, tenderly performed, with vivid cameos from Robert Duvall, Jim Jarmusch and the late JT Walsh.</p> <p><strong>Nine To Five</strong> (Colin Higgins, 1980) <br>10.55pm, BBC1</p> <p>Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton are an unlikely trio of office workers out to punish their smarmy, sexist boss, the hilarious Dabney Coleman. Serious equal-ops points are made without slowing the pace of some jolly farce: first they think they've poisoned him; later he's chained up and force-fed TV soap-operas.</p> <p><strong>Monday October 11</strong></p> <p><strong>Move Over, Darling</strong> (Michael Gordon, 1963) <br>1.20pm, C4</p> <p>A deft reworking of Garson Kanin's fizzy 1940 comedy, My Favourite Wife, that starred Cary Grant and Irene Dunne. This has sunny Doris Day as the woman arriving home after five years marooned on a Pacific island to discover husband James Garner has just remarried, to sexy Polly Bergen. Day and Garner are amiably appealing, rather than sparky; Chuck Connors co-stars as the hunk with whom Day was stranded.</p> <p><strong>Magic</strong> (Richard Attenborough, 1978) <br>12.20am, BBC1</p> <p>A creepy tale, adapted by William Goldman from his novel. Anthony Hopkins plays a ventriloquist gradually dominated by his dummy, the revolting, epicene Fats: it's an alarming picture of mental deterioration, from quirky to barking. Burgess Meredith is Hopkins' sad, doomed agent and Ann-Margret is under threat.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday October 12</strong></p> <p><strong>Face Of A Fugitive</strong> (Paul Wendkos, 1959) <br>1.50pm, C4</p> <p>One of James Coburn's early appearances. He's a lowly henchman of land-grabbing rancher Alan Baxter, and Fred MacMurray is the wrongly accused robber who sets matters right in an intelligent western.</p> <p><strong>Little Man Tate</strong> (Jodie Foster, 1991) <br>3.40pm, Five</p> <p>Jodie Foster's directorial debut is a worthy attempt at a tough subject. She plays a mother struggling to cope with her child-prodigy son (Adam Hann-Byrd), and fighting instinctively against the attentions of child psychologist Dianne Wiest in a rather overstated head-versus-heart clash. There are lighter moments, but it needs a more subtle touch.</p> <p><strong>Mad Dog And Glory</strong> (John McNaughton, 1993) <br>11pm, ITV1</p> <p>Mad Dog is the ironic nickname of Robert De Niro's lonely, inhibited police photographer; Uma Thurman's Glory is the shopgirl \"given\" to him for a week as a reward for saving the life of mobster Milo (Bill Murray) during an armed raid. It's an intriguing set up that cleverly blends thriller, romance and comedy.</p> <p><strong>Cry, The Beloved Country</strong> (Darrell Roodt, 1995) <br>12.20am, BBC2</p> <p>This remake of Korda's 1951 film is a heartfelt but uncompromising account of grief and loss in 1940s apartheid South Africa. James Earl Jones brings his familiar quiet dignity to the role of the rural minister travelling to Johannesburg in search of his son; Richard Harris is just as affecting as the wealthy white landowner on a similarly painful quest.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday October 13</strong></p> <p><strong>Millions Like Us</strong> (Sidney Gilliat, Frank Launder, 1943)<br>1.25pm, C4</p> <p>This warm-hearted portrait of a family at war, and a society in transformation, was a classic 1940s British flag-waver. In an excellent cast Patricia Roc stands out as young Celia, who leaves home to take a job in a factory - where Eric Portman is the foreman - and falls for shy aeroplane gunner Gordon Jackson. Gilliat and Launder, who also wrote the screenplay, employ an absorbing, semi-documentary approach, but can't resist having some fun.</p> <p><strong>Raising Cain</strong> (Brian De Palma, 1992) <br>11pm, ITV1</p> <p>John Lithgow, a fine supporting actor - cold and nasty in Cliffhanger, for instance - isn't up to carrying a film, and he's left dangling here on a ludicrous plotline about a not-very-able psychologist and his murderous alter-ego, Cain: Jekyll and Hyde without the hair. Lolita Davidovitch is the understandably nervous wife.</p> <p><strong>Air America</strong> (Roger Spottiswoode, 1990) <br>11.15pm, BBC1</p> <p>Mel Gibson in Mad mode as fearless gun-running, drug-smuggling pilot flying dodgy deals for CIA masters in wartorn Laos. As an adventure it's fine, with explosive action blowing away the finer political points it raises. It also sports the kind of 1960s soundtrack that has you thinking fondly of the Vietnam war. With Robert Downey Jr.</p> <p><strong>Thursday October 14</strong></p> <p><strong>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</strong> (Peter Segal, 2000) <br>8pm, Five</p> <p>If you're a big fan of Eddie Murphy you'll enjoy this raucous sequel to his 1996 hit; if not, the sight of him playing the small-whale-sized Prof Klump as well as most of the Klump family (Mama, Papa and raunchy Grandma too) could make you faintly nauseous. It's along the lines of an Alec Guinness trick, but with mountains of latex, and all in a tediously hysterical pitch. He's also, of course, slim and troublesome Buddy Love, who stands between the tubby one and lifelong happiness with sweet scientist Janet Jackson.</p> <p><strong>The Tichborne Claimant</strong> (David Yates, 1998) <br>12.20am, BBC2</p> <p>Yates's deft and droll period drama is a tale of Victorian gold-digging, with manservant John Kani dispatched to Australia to locate the missing Lord Tichborne: he returns with the highly unlikely Robert Pugh, a walking spanner-in- the-works of the establishment. Stephen Fry, Robert Hardy and John Gielgud are among the top-class cast.</p> <p><strong>Friday October 15</strong></p> <p><strong>American Perfekt</strong> (Paul Chart, 1997) <br>11.35pm, BBC1</p> <p>Despite the rather affected misspelling of the title there's a genuinely skewed, Coen brothers psychology to this alternative road movie. It has Robert Forster (who was always ahead of the game in Tarantino's Jackie Brown) as a doctor dog-legging around America's Midwest, spinning a silver dollar to determine his direction. Inevitably the coin drops him into trouble, with a pair of difficult sisters (Amanda Plummer, Fairuza Balk) and a nasty, nasal English conman (David Thewlis) in a drama that has an edgy, dislocated air.</p> <p><strong>A Room For Romeo Brass</strong> (Shane Meadows, 1999) <br>12.30am, BBC2</p> <p>Meadows' brilliant little movie starts out as a larky, Mike Leigh-type tale of two Midlands housing-estate lads, but heads into much darker territory. Andrew Shim is cheery Romeo, Ben Marshall his limping, bullied mate, Knocks; they're the best of 12-year-old buddies until the arrival of a sullen, edgy individual called Morell (the excellent Paddy Considine, now appearing in Dead Man's Shoes) who has designs on Romeo's sister Ladine (Vicky McClure). Despite the Leigh/ Loach resonances it's a fresh and captivating portrait of youngsters that concludes with a totally unexpected, violent flourish.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Fable </strong><br>XBox</p> <p>Fable's lofty ambition is to give you control over your character's entire life from birth to death, allowing you to decide which skills to learn and to choose whether to be a heroic do-gooder or black-hearted murderer from whom law-abiding villagers cower, with your preference showing in your ethereal halo or red glowing eyes and budding horns. Taking place in a deliciously organic-feeling, sun-dappled woodland world, role-playing game essentials, such as gaining experience to increase your power, are joined by the ability to flirt, marry, cheat on your wife and divorce, as well as opportunities to indulge in an array of tattoos and peculiar haircuts along the way.

  "Was President Bush literally channeling Karl Rove in his first debate with John Kerry? That's the latest rumour flooding the Internet, unleashed last week in the wake of an image caught by a television camera during the Miami debate. The image shows a large solid object between Bush's shoulder blades as he leans over the lectern and faces moderator Jim Lehrer. <p>The president is not known to wear a back brace, and it's safe to say he wasn't packing. So was the bulge under his well-tailored jacket a hidden receiver, picking up transmissions from someone offstage feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece? Did the device explain why the normally ramrod-straight president seemed hunched over during much of the debate? </p> <p>Bloggers are burning up their keyboards <a href=\"http://www.isbushwired.com/\">with speculation</a>. Check out the president's <a href=\"http://www.cannonfire.blogspot.com/\">peculiar behaviour</a> during the debate, they say. On several occasions, the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face. Was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question? Even weirder was the president's strange outburst. In a peeved rejoinder to Kerry, he said, \"As the politics change, his positions change. And that's not how a commander in chief acts. I, I, uh - Let me finish - The intelligence I looked at was the same intelligence my opponent looked at.\" It must be said that Bush pointed toward Lehrer as he declared \"Let me finish.\" The green warning light was lit, signalling he had 30 seconds to, well, finish. </p> <p>Hot on the conspiracy trail, I tried to track down the source of the photo. None of the Bush-is-wired bloggers, however, seemed to know where the photo came from. Was it possible the bulge had been Photoshopped onto Bush's back by a lone conspiracy buff? It turns out that all of the video of the debate was recorded and sent out by Fox News, the pool broadcaster for the event. Fox sent feeds from multiple cameras to the other networks, which did their own on-air presentations and editing. </p> <p>To watch the debate again, I ventured to the website of the most sober network I could think of: C-SPAN. And sure enough, at minute 23 on the video of the debate, you can clearly see the bulge between the president's shoulder blades. </p> <p>Bloggers stoke the conspiracy with the claim that the Bush administration insisted on a condition that no cameras be placed behind the candidates. An official for the Commission on Presidential Debates, which set up the lecterns and microphones on the Miami stage, said the condition was indeed real, the result of negotiations by both campaigns. Yet that didn't stop Fox from setting up cameras behind Bush and Kerry. The official said that \"microphones were mounted on lecterns, and the commission put no electronic devices on the president or Senator Kerry.\" When asked about the bulge on Bush's back, the official said, \"I don't know what that was.\" </p> <p>So what was it? Jacob McKenna, a spyware expert and the owner of the Spy Store, a high-tech surveillance shop in Spokane, Washington, looked at the Bush image on his computer monitor. \"There's certainly something on his back, and it appears to be electronic,\" he said. McKenna said that, given its shape, the bulge could be the inductor portion of a two-way push-to-talk system. McKenna noted that such a system makes use of a tiny microchip-based earplug radio that is pushed way down into the ear canal, where it is virtually invisible. He also said a weak signal could be scrambled and be undetected by another broadcaster. </p> <p>Mystery-bulge bloggers argue that the president may have begun using such technology earlier in his term. Because Bush is famously prone to malapropisms and reportedly dyslexic, which could make successful use of a teleprompter problematic, they say the president and his handlers may have turned to a technique often used by television reporters on remote stand-ups. A reporter tapes a story and, while on camera, plays it back into an earpiece, repeating lines just after hearing them, managing to sound spontaneous and error free. </p> <p>Suggestions that Bush may have using this technique stem from a D-day event in France, when a CNN broadcast appeared to pick up - and broadcast to surprised viewers - the sound of another voice seemingly reading Bush his lines, after which Bush repeated them. Danny Schechter, who operates the news site MediaChannel.org, and who has been doing some investigating into the wired-Bush rumors himself, said the Bush campaign has been worried of late about others picking up their radio frequencies - notably during the Republican Convention on the day of Bush's appearance. \"They had a frequency specialist stop me and ask about the frequency of my camera,\" Schechter said. \"The Democrats weren't doing that at their convention.\" </p> <p>Repeated calls to the White House and the Bush national campaign office over a period of three days, inquiring about what the president may have been wearing on his back during the debate, and whether he had used an audio device at other events, went unreturned. So far the Kerry campaign is staying clear of this story. When called for a comment, a press officer at the Democratic National Committee claimed on Tuesday that it was \"the first time\" they'd ever heard of the issue. A spokeswoman at the press office of Kerry headquarters refused to permit me to talk with anyone in the campaign's research office. Several other requests for comment to the Kerry campaign's press office went unanswered. </p> <p>As for whether we really do have a Milli Vanilli president, the answer at this point has to be, God only knows.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Dave Lindorff is the author of This Can't Be Happening!

  "<p>A Big Brother-style show for comedians on E4 has descended into chaos after the telephone lines broke down and the comics threatened to revolt.</p> <p>Channel 4 was bombarded with complaints after the technical hitch on Kings of Comedy, which pitches old-school comics such as Stan Boardman and Mick Miller against the new generation of stand-up comedians.</p> <p>Perrier award-winner Scott Capurro was voted off the show after producers were forced to take a studio vote when the phone lines broke down. But viewers complained that the audience poll was unfair, and the stand-ups were so unhappy with the decision they were reportedly on the verge of walking out of the series.</p> <p>A source close to the production said some of the comics were still considering quitting the show, which is made by the Big Brother producer, Endemol. </p> <p>\"Even though Stan [Boardman] got through he looked utterly revolted at the means used to put him through,\" said Ashley Godley, the daughter of Janey Godley, one of the comics taking part. </p> <p>\"It was claimed that the phone lines were not operational, though I think it is highly likely that no one phoned at all. As a result, the two comedians were faced with a hastily counted hand vote from the bewildered audience,\" she said in her webblog.</p> <p>\"You would think that [such a] a reputable channel would have a back-up plan for the chance that perhaps no one would vote, however, that again was something they had not considered in the running of the show.\"</p> <p>Eight stand-ups were chosen for the show, which began on E4 this week. One comic is voted off in each of the first four weeks before the four finalists compete in a grand final.</p> <p>Some of the comics, who are living together in a Big Brother-style house, are still considering quitting the show. \"They are far from happy with the way things have turned out so far,\" said a source.</p> <p>Boardman and Capurro were up for the first \"eviction\" in last night's show. The Liverpudlian comedian - infamous for his repeated use of the word \"Fokker\" on the Des O'Connor show - survived the audience vote but viewers complained of a miscount.</p> <p>\"It was the biggest most obvious fix I have ever seen,\" claimed one viewer. Another said: \"I just hope the comics don't go back into the house on Monday after realising what a farce it has been so far. Phone lines down, really bad editing, no major advertising. They'd be fools to go back in there!\"</p> <p>\"Stan Boardman was stunned for once,\" complained a viewer on the programme's website. \"You could tell he was very angry.\"</p> <p>An E4 spokeswoman admitted there had been a miscount but said it would not have affected the result. \"The comedians weren't happy because the phone lines didn't work and they have bonded quite well over the week,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The production company went back to check the votes. There was a miscalculation but it was not enough to affect the decision. We went to the audience because it was the next best thing to a phone vote.\"</p> <p>The \"old school\" comics are represented by Boardman, Miller, Goldman and David Copperfield. Among the new talent, Capurro is joined by Boothby Graffoe, Ava Vidal and Andrew Maxwell.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for producer Endemol said: \"An audience vote was the fairest decision we could make. Everyone was obviously very upset with the phone vote not working. </p> <p>\"The comedians were upset by the way things turned out but we are talking to them now and hopefully they will come back on Sunday.\"</p> <p>Highlights from the first week of the E4 show will air on Channel 4 at 10.30pm tonight. Kings of Comedy was one of the first shows made under a 300-hour production deal between E4 and Endemol.

The serious papers and the television concentrated on the wars: the one between the neighbours from hell in Downing Street; and to a lesser extent, the one in Iraq. </p> <p>This is remarkable. It matters little to anyone. Yet here we are, treated to the secret ravings of one faction or the other and the endless divination of the entrails by pundits bored by an endless diet of successful government.</p> <p>Don't mention the other war. They tried not to. Tony Blair's personal achilles heel. Without being an apologist for him, I would say he believed he was saving the western world and needed to carry the country with him. All those bothersome caveats in intelligence reports just got in the way. He is now unloved among Labour supporters but still acceptable to middle-ground voters.</p> <p>Eye-catching new policies were missing. But no one should be misled: this has been a competent government.</p> <p><b>Howard and the Tories</b></p> <p>Just as I was dismayed by media coverage of Labour's conference I am cautious about the doom-laden take on the Conservatives. Ukip have already served to push both the Tories and Labour and even the Lib Dems towards Euroscepticism. But in a general election they will have little impact.</p> <p>A chastened Oliver Letwin implies but doesn't promise lower taxes, and promises continued investment in public services while asserting that super-efficiency will save squillions of pounds while not making anyone redundant. </p> <p>Why am I not convinced? Whatever move he makes, Gordon Brown will cover it, therefore the shadow Chancellor is trapped in a policy pea-souper where he can only nod and wink and tap his nose. </p> <p>The Tories will privatise to their hearts' content if elected. </p> <p>The Tory vote-winners are law and order and immigration. These are not the biggest problems facing the country today, but it was essential that Michael Howard went big on them, and he did. More expensive prisons, more expensive prisoners spending longer in them. Tories around the country drooled, as did, no doubt, Group 4 and other private security firms who will be the recipients of all this extra business. </p> <p>More police too, and - this is neat - all paid for by stopping immigration in its tracks and re-assigning its budget.</p> <p>The immigration issue is the race card in disguise and it is particularly powerful in the present climate. It borrows a spurious justification from the \"war on terror\" and has received consistent attention from the rightwing press. It has won votes for Ukip and the BNP (and ironically Plaid Cymru, which campaigns against the predations of white, elderly, middle class, English immigrants). The Conservative party has gone after its baby-eating core vote and dropped any ambivalence - about the European Union too. Forget Conservative Europhiles, they will not now rock the boat.</p> <p>I welcome this new honest dishonesty. Michael Howard's preconception of what Britain wants speaks to the rich, the xenophobic, the bigoted and the frightened. </p> <p>It is exclusive, not inclusive. Bigger prisons, smaller universities. I found his philosophy refreshingly loathsome, as loathsome as the idea of Nicholas Soames' first kiss.</p> <p>Will it work? To a degree. It will win back those on the hard right but will be sobering to those who had begun to speak of Labour as Tory lite. </p> <p>Trust. Curious this, from Michael Howard. People of my age (55) remember him, and not fondly, in the swaggering heyday of Conservative government. </p> <p>More to the point do we trust big government or big business? Paradoxically, although politicians are mistrusted (rightly, since we demand lies before we will vote for them), 18 years of Tory government turned the public against privatisation. Think who you want to administer your pension, your health care, your education and security. </p> <p>Private finance initiatives give poor value and service and are ultimately inefficient - yet the Conservatives want more of this .</p> <p><b>What I want</b></p> <p>In their third term I want Labour to grasp the nettle: no more PFI and PPP. Big government is hard to do well, but it is honest.</p> <p>From the Tories I want to see more honesty.</p>",

  "<p>The lecturers' union Natfhe today criticised universities for dragging their feet over implementing laws concerning race equality in employment.</p> <p>The union is also pressing for new pay agreements being worked out this year to be assessed against race relations legislation, or universities would face a \"barrage\" of employment tribunal claims.</p> <p>A survey by the funding council Hefce found one in five institutions were making only limited progress towards fulfilling their obligations under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 (RRAA). </p> <p>The survey covered 66 universities and colleges - a further four did not submit reports. \"Two-thirds were progressing reasonably or positively. About 13% could be said to be making impressive progress, while around 20% were, for various reasons, more limited in their progress,\" said the report published last month. The survey looked at institutions' policies on paper, not how well they were being implemented.</p> <p>The head of the union's universities department, Roger Kline, said: \"The Hefce report shows that a substantial number of universities are dragging their feet when it comes to monitoring the numbers of black and ethnic minority staff.\"</p> <p>He said many institutions were still not publishing essential data on the ethnicity of staff. \"Even worse, many fall well short of their minimum legal obligations. Some of the worst performers are significant national institutions like Manchester University, which did not even respond to Hefce's survey.\"</p> <p>He added: \"These laws were introduced to challenge institutional racism following the death of Stephen Lawrence. It is four years since the Race Relations Amendment Act was introduced, yet British universities still remain a desperately pale place.

While this may not seem surprising, it indicates that some higher education institutions in predominantly white areas are struggling to develop effective ways of attracting staff and/or student candidates from beyond their local communities.</p> <p>\"However, a significant number of such institutions are trying new and innovative methods, with positive results, such as targeted advertising in ethnic minority media, recruitment drives in more diverse areas within the region, reviews of recruitment and selection procedures, and commissioned research into the causes of low ethnic minority recruitment.\"</p> <p>Firm leadership and commitment from senior levels were required to ensure race equality was recognised as a key strand of the equalities agenda, said the report.</p>",

  "<p>Purists will no doubt lament the passing of Chips and Bully Beef, Smasher, Korky the Cat and Desperate Dan's gun, but the Dandy - the nation's longest-running comic - is attempting to etch itself on the consciousness of a new generation of readers with a relaunch today.</p> <p>The favourite childhood read of anyone over 40 - who could buy the comic for the princely sum of two old pennies compared with \u00a31.20 today - might not take kindly to the new, more politically correct, comic. But publisher DC Thomson is adamant the changes will help the struggling title \"bowl\" kids over in the newsagents. </p> <p>Out go old favourites like Beryl the Peril and Smasher, not to mention the 1968 classic Spunky and His Spider - and in comes Jak the cool kid with big sister problems. </p> <p>In an attempt to bring a little multiculturalism to the mix, the new Dandy - tagline: Can You Handle It? - introduces Dreadlock Holmes, a cod Rastafarian homage to Conan Doyle's famous detective.</p> <p>Desperate Dan is still there, but now looks like he's been on an Atkins diet. Plus he has no gun. His holster's still there, but it looks like one of those fabulously over-designed belt-worn mobile phone pouches that went in and out of fashion sometime in 1995.</p> <p>Bananaman - the story of little Eric who turns into a superhero after eating the tropical fruit - also survives the redesign. He first appeared after the Dandy underwent its first mid-life crisis in 1985, when three months shy of its 48th birthday it was forced to merge with Nutty.</p> <p>Cuddles and Dimples - the troublesome toddlers - who appeared a year later also make the cut, as does Owen Goal and his football-mad mentor, Coachie.</p> <p>DC Thomson said it undertook in-depth research before relaunching the magazine in a bid to make the venerable magazine \"cool\" again among its core seven- to 11-year-old readership. </p> <p>Like the very first issue, sold at auction for a dandy \u00a320,350 last month, the all-new comic keeps the covermount going. It was the first time a freebie had been given away with a magazine - back in 1937 it was a free Express Whistle - hardly likely to tempt the kids of today - so that's been replaced with a \"free gross tongue\". </p> <p>DC Thomson says the redesign should help stem a long-term sales decline. In its heyday in the mid-1960s the Dandy was selling well over 2 million. But just prior to the relaunch sales had slumped to less than 50,000.</p> <p>\"We're never going to hit the 2 million mark again but if we could double existing sales to around 100,000 we'd be happy,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>The comic that broke the mould when its first edition hit the shops in 1937 is trying to do it again. Sixty seven years ago it was the colour and A4 format that pitched the comic into the hearts and minds of game-free, TV-free, celebrity-free school kids. </p> <p>Today with all the competition, glossing up that colour and bringing in a few new names is unlikely to provide the same epoch-making impact.

  "Gender politics seems to be behind the furore surrounding the Constance Spry exhibition at the Design Museum (Letters, October 5). Perhaps what Terence Conran, James Dyson and Stephen Bayley perceive is a feminisation of the Design Museum in its recent exhibitions on fashion and the domestic sphere. But their notions of good design are predicated on outdated paternalistic, modernist, middle-class notions of taste, favouring industrial design. <p>While I don't like the way in which the Spry exhibition has been realised - it is lacking in context and misrepresents Spry - I want to defend the museum's decision to mount it. Many of us who teach design history are interested in the question: what is design? Together, with a growing number of young designers, we have been exploring the boundaries between professional and amateur design, consumption practices and popular taste. And, yes, this even includes flowers.<br> <b>Dr Deborah Sugg Ryan</b><br> Loughborough University School of Art &amp; Design </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> At the root of Dyson's resignation at the Design Museum is, I suspect, the hijacking of the term design since the 1960s. Before then it brought to mind engineering design, as well as other types. Since then, it's a term that has been promoted by the graphic design and fashion industries so that now there are courses in design which are about nothing else but graphic design and/or fashion. When the meaning of a word narrows like this, it leaves unrepresented all the other activities, and most of those are more important for our long-term wellbeing than graphic design or fashion.<br> <b>Ken Goddard</b><br> Rowlands Castle, Hants </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Design Museum is being pushed by forces largely beyond its control. Nor does it have the funds to originate many exhibitions. Under New Labour, funding has moved towards promoting accessibility and social inclusion rather than the presentation of innovative exhibitions. The concepts of humanism, optimism, lateral thinking and grand planning that characterised Dyson's heroes - Brunel and Buckminster Fuller - are largely absent from current debates.<br> <b> Nico Macdonald</b><br> London</p>",
  "<p>If you are a new parent, grandparent, doting relative or family friend who wants to mark the birth of a child by making some kind of financial gift, what's the best way of doing it? Choosing the most suitable home for your generosity depends to a large extent on how much you want to save, how much risk you want to take and whether you want to commit to regular saving. But your relationship to a child is also an important factor, since it can affects the way in which the return from an investment is taxed.</p> <p>Parents who want to put aside money in a child's name, rather than simply earmarking savings of their own to hand over when a child turns 18 - should first consider the options for tax-free saving. This is because interest earned on money given by parents - even if invested in a child's name - is treated as that of the parent (although there's no tax for a parent to pay on income from money given to a child if it is less than \u00a3100 per parent each tax year). So what are the options?</p> <p>Although not available until April 6 2005, and then only for parents of children born on or after September 1 2002, the default option for most new parents is likely to be the new tax-free Child Trust Fund (CTF) to which parents (and others) will be able to contribute up to a total of \u00a31,200 each tax year on behalf of each child eligible for the CTF. This is on top of the voucher worth a minimum of \u00a3250 that the government will automatically send to parents of eligible children along with an information pack detailing which companies will be offering CTFs and how parents can go about opening one. (To ensure that no child misses out, the Inland Revenue will open a CTF for any child whose parents have failed to act within a year of receiving the voucher.) </p> <p>A variety of investments will be available for CTFs - including ordinary savings accounts - but the government is particularly keen for children to have the opportunity to benefit from the generally higher returns available from stock-market based investments over the longer term. So all CTF providers must offer a CTF Stakeholder account which invests in shares, but which gradually moves assets in the CTF into less risky investments as the child approaches the age of 18. Further details will be given in the information packs which will start being sent out in November 2004, which is also when the dedicated CTF website will go live. </p> <p>A tax-free and low-risk alternative for parents whose children don't qualify for the CTF, or for those who want to invest more than \u00a31,200 allowed in the CTF, are Children's Bonus Bonds from <a href=\"http://www.nsandi.com\"> National Savings &amp; Investments</a>. Provided the bond is held for a full five years, the current issue in which you can invest a maximum of \u00a31,000 per child provides an annual fixed return of 4.45%. The possible drawback of these bonds is that the child gets control of the money at 16 (rather than 18) although they can be kept going until the bondholder turns 21. </p> <p>For parents prepared to commit to saving a maximum of \u00a325 a month (or \u00a3270 a year) for a minimum of ten years, an alternative but more risky option is a friendly society tax-exempt savings plan such as the Baby Bond from the <a href=\"http://www.thechildrensmutual.co.uk\"> Children's Mutual</a> or its larger friendly-society rival <a href=\"http://www.familyinvestments.com\"> Family Investments</a> which specialises in low premium tax-efficient savings for the family. However, although the payout from these plans is tax-free, they are inflexible and charges can be high, especially when compared with investing directly in other stock-market-based investments such as unit and investment trusts (which also have the advantage that you are not committed to saving for a specific number of years). You can compare charges levied by friendly societies by using the comparative tables on the Financial Services Authority <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk\"> website</a>. </p> <p>There is nothing to stop people who are not a child's parent from buying friendly society savings plans and Children's bonus bonds, and people other than parents can also make contributions to a CTF. However, the golden rule is always to ask the parent first, to avoid the possibility that your gift will take the child's investment over the tax-free limit and so that your money will be returned to you.</p> <p>But there is actually no need for non-parents to choose tax-free investments. Any money invested in a child's name by someone who is not a child's parent is effectively tax free anyway, since income earned by savings in the child's name is treated as the child's. So there is no tax to pay if it does not exceed his or her personal tax allowance of \u00a34,745 (in the 2004-5 tax year). This is also the case with money you give to a parent to invest for a child on your behalf (which is why it makes sense for parents to keep money they have given their children separate from that given by friends and relations).</p> <p>Capital gains on money invested for a child are also likely to be tax free, which is one of the reasons why collective stock market-based investments such as unit trusts, OEICs (open-ended investment companies) and investment trusts are a popular choice with people who want to invest on behalf of a child - especially those who want to build up a nest egg through regular saving. Returns are also likely to be higher than investing money in a savings account. For example, \u00a31,000 invested in the average unit trust ten years ago would now be worth around \u00a32,400 while the same amount invested in the average savings account would have grown to just \u00a31,300.</p> <p>On a more practical note, it is much easier for a non-parent to invest in unit trusts and so on than it is to open a savings account for a child who is not your own, since you don't need to produce documentary proof of the child's name and address. Instead you simply invest in your own name but designate your investment to be for a child by adding the child's initials. More information on investing in collective investments on behalf of a child is available both from the <a href=\"http://www.investmentuk.org\"> Investment Management Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.itsonline.co.uk\"> Association of Investment Trust Companies</a>.</p>",
  "<p>A criticism frequently levelled at the music industry is that it is overly enchanted with image. Take the example of Vince Power, founder of the Mean Fiddler empire, which counts the London Astoria and the Reading Festival among its many enterprises. He has a certain Phil Mitchell-like quality - stocky, balding, stubbly about the edges, with a whiff of the boxer about him, and a hardy upbringing in rural Ireland that together have forged a certain tough-guy image. </p> <p>\"Just because I'm Irish, people said I was being supported by the IRA,\" Power told the Guardian in 1999. \"That's crap. I got where I am by sheer hard work and a bit of luck - nothing else ... Because I came from nowhere, people like to think there must be more to it than that. People like to have their images.\" </p> <p>Protest though he may, it is an image that has certainly done him no harm. It is a reputation that growls: '\"You don't mess with Vince.\" </p> <p>He certainly casts a long shadow. Perhaps not surprisingly, few music industry insiders are eager to talk on-record about him. </p> <p>But for a while now, he has been trying to edge away from his hard-nosed image and recast himself as a cuddlier creature, referring in interviews to his charity work, his vintage cars and his love of leisurely Sunday brunches with his family. He has also set about quietly selling his 35% stake in the Mean Fiddler group, because, as he puts it, \"I think I've come as far as I can now; it is a plc. I was never a big plc fan.\" </p> <p>This week, however, he found himself back in the limelight when the sale of a 15% share of his stake - to the internet entrepreneur Richard Clingen - was blocked by shareholders. </p> <p>Clingen had been due to replace Power as the company's executive chairman, and had already marked the operations director, Dean James, as chief executive, dispatching Power's right-hand man, Melvin Benn. With the collapse of the sale, James was summarily removed from the board, and Power was reinstated at the company's helm. The dust has yet to settle. </p> <p>Power, 57, has built Mean Fiddler into a company worth bickering over, with a turnover of about \u00a355m a year and a 300-strong workforce. At 16, he rejected a career in artificial bull insemination in County Waterford, leaving for England and a procession of jobs: making ice cream, demolition, and a stint in the haberdashery department at Woolworths. </p> <p>He turned the corner towards fortune after he invested in an old van and drove around London collecting second-hand furniture to sell. </p> <p>Over the years, he has bought up music venues in much the same way. First came the original Mean Fiddler, a country and western club in Harlesden, north-west London, which he opened in 1982. The venue swiftly gained a reputation as a home for new acts such as the Pogues, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions, and the Men They Couldn't Hang. </p> <p>Since then have come numerous other high-profile venues, such as the Garage, Jazz Cafe, Clapham Grand, Kentish Town Forum, Stratford Rex, and an array of festivals including the London Fleadh, Reading, and the now defunct Phoenix. </p> <p>Today, Power sits atop a total of eight festivals, 14 live music venues, restaurants, bars and a successful events firm, organising tours for the likes of Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera. </p> <p>He is a man who evidently feels there is safety in numbers. Born one of 11 children, he has over the years amassed three wives, eight children and seven grandchildren, along with his \u00a330m fortune. </p> <p>A spoke is thought to have been put in Power's wheel, however, by a rival promoter, Denis Desmond, who built a 24% stake in Mean Fiddler last year. Through his Irish business, MCD, Desmond's investments include the V festival, the Brixton Academy and the Point in Dublin. Their rivalry dates back many years, with some pinpointing it to 1993, when Power trod firmly on Desmond's toes by bringing Fleadh Mor, an Irish incarnation of the London event, to County Waterford. In so doing, Power placed himself in direct competition with Desmond's Feile in County Tipperary. Ireland could not accommodate two festivals of that size, and despite stellar line-ups, both promoters lost money that year. </p> <p>Desmond is far from being the only person Power has riled over the years. There have been highly publicised spats with Westminster council over fly-posting for his venues, and a shooting incident at the Astoria in 2001, which resulted in a recommendation that the venue's licence be revoked. </p> <p>In the early days, too, Power made few friends by dealing directly with artists himself rather than with their managers. Then, earlier this summer, he had something of a tussle with one of the best-loved figures in the music industry, the Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis. </p> <p>Mean Fiddler became involved with Glastonbury following the 2000 festival, when gatecrashers pushed the venue well beyond its licensed capacity, incurring a fine for Eavis and throwing the future of the festival into doubt. Reassured by the involvement of an events company as reputed as Mean Fiddler, Mendip council agreed to grant Glastonbury another licence. Mean Fiddler secured a 20% stake in the festival, which rises by 10% each year. </p> <p>However, by June this year, the relationship had soured. Power gave an interview to the Daily Telegraph in the run-up to this summer's festival in which he seemed to take credit for Glastonbury's increased success and improved security. Eavis was incensed. \"It's nothing to do with Vince, that's the thing,\" he says, with considerable exasperation. \"And I get annoyed about it.\" </p> <p>Yet the Mean Fiddler-Glastonbury partnership is set to continue until 2006. \"The paperwork - I wouldn't really call it a contract - is just two sides of A4, handwritten; we had more of a verbal agreement to work together until 2006,\" explains Eavis. \"After that, I'll probably retire but, oh yeah, of course I would hesitate to renew the agreement.\" </p> <p>It seems that Power's way of working is characteristically antagonistic. </p> <p>\"Vince and I go back a long, long way, specifically we had a workable relationship in the '90s when I was editing the NME,\" recalls Steve Sutherland, now the executive director of the New Musical Express. \"We used to dance a familiar tango every year, with the Mean Fiddler feeding us news stories about the Reading festival and the Phoenix. And then, as sure as Easter or Christmas will come around every year, and often as late as a couple of days before the Reading festival itself, I would get a call saying, 'Vince Power's on the line: could you hold?' And Vince would come on the line and use all sorts of language - call me things I couldn't say to you.\" </p> <p>It seems Power felt that the NME devoted an excessive amount of coverage to the Glastonbury festival, at the expense of Reading. \"He would end up saying all of the NME were banned from Reading and from all Mean Fiddler events. And then I would spend the next two hours with him on the phone, trying to make it right, basically.\" </p> <p>Despite the gripes, Power's contribution to the British music scene cannot be denied. Over the years, he has shepherded many new bands towards fame and fortune, as well as furnishing the country with some of its finest music venues and festivals. \"In fairness to him,\" admits Eavis, \"through Mean Fiddler, the Jazz Cafe, all those venues in London, and the Reading festival, I suppose he's certainly raised the profile of live music.\" </p> <p>Tim Perry, who books bands for the Windmill, a venue in Brixton, says Mean Fiddler \"has always been really nice with us. The Garage is one of my favourite venues in London; Reading and Leeds are my favourite festivals because it's just about bands.\" </p> <p>He cites ticket prices in the capital as his only beef with the company, but admits \"everyone's as guilty as everyone else - it's not just Mean Fiddler\". </p> <p>It's wrong, he argues, to suggest that Power has a stranglehold over London's music venues. The company doesn't, for example, boast any of London's biggest venues. \"Power hasn't anywhere of the capacity of Brixton Academy,\" he points out. \"It's really not a monopoly.\" </p> <p>If Power succeeds in selling his share in Mean Fiddler, and if Desmond increases his own stake, the country's music venues may, in fact, be in far greater danger of monopolisation. </p> <p>\"Slowly but surely, there is a creeping consolidation of promotions companies - Denis Desmond, SJM, Clear Channel,\" observes Sutherland. \"And it's kind of natural at some stage that one fish will swallow another. It's hard now to think there was once a time when you could put a name and a face to enterprises. With Vince, you had a feisty face to the festival and, yes, I always found him intimidating, but not immovable. It's more difficult with a corporation - with Vince you knew it might have been painful, but you knew what you were getting.\" </p> <p><strong>Life in short</strong></p> <p><strong> Born </strong> April 27 1947, Kilmacthomas, County Waterford </p> <p><strong> Education </strong> Kilmacthomas primary school, Dungarvan Vocational College.

  "<p>In Britain, finely crafted posters for rock gigs are up there with loon pants, idiot dancing, festivals policed by Hell's Angels and the oeuvre of Principal Edwards Magic Theatre: a dimly remembered facet of the late-1960s and early-1970s music scene. Richly evocative of a long-lost era, the work of once-famed psychedelic British poster artists Martin Clarke or Hapshash and the Coloured Coat fetches three-figure sums on the collectors' market, while your average rock concert in 2004 is advertised by nothing more complicated than a photo of the artist in question and a copy of their logo.</p> <p>In America, however, the concept of concert-poster-as-art never really went away. The punk era brought with it the stark, disturbing cartoons of Raymond Pettibon - now an internationally recognised artist, but best known to rock fans for his work for his younger brother's band, Black Flag. In the 1990s, small US venues and alt-rock bands regularly commissioned artists to provide one-off posters for their gigs. In the process, the work of Leia Bell, Gary Houston, Rob Jones, the PNE Collective - the latter most closely associated with metal band Queens of the Stone Age, producing work such as the \"Q\" poster - has developed a cult following entirely of its own. The first UK exhibition of another celebrated US poster artist, Chicago-based Jay Ryan, opens today at Manchester's Richard Goodall gallery.</p> <p>No one seems entirely certain why rock poster art died out in the UK. One theory is that British rock bands, more image-conscious than their American counterparts, resent giving up control over how their music is presented to an artist.</p> <p>That, however, may be about to change. Alex Gilbert, A&amp;R Manager of Warner Brothers' label 14th Floor, recently commissioned American post artist Justin Hampton to provide work for one of his charges, indie rockers Longview. He thinks that, given the success of largely imageless bands such as Keane and Snow Patrol, the time may be right for poster artists to inject some visual excitement.</p> <p>\"The work can be scary or funny - just really interesting,\" he says. \"You get the impression that the people involved are not taking the music too seriously. That was one of the reasons Longview wanted to get involved: that epic-like indie sound they have tends to get taken very seriously. If you look through the history of great British indie music, those Coldplay-esque kind of bands don't have a very striking visual image; they prefer to let the songs do the talking. I wanted an image that you would never expect an indie band to have. The artist drew them as super-villains, like Dr Evil or Blofeld from James Bond. The two gigs we produced the posters for sold out.\"</p> <p>George Akins of Nottingham's Rock City venue is one of the few British promoters to follow the American lead and commission poster art for shows at his venue. He is quick to point out the genre's impracticalities as a promotional device, however. \"They're so beautifully done and expensively screen printed that you can't really put them all over the place,\" he says. \"You want posters that advertise gigs to stay up, and these wouldn't last five minutes before somebody nicked them\"</p> <p>But he remains a firm believer in the work of the poster artists. \"Bands love it if you do something a bit special for them - they love to see them. They're not really something that we have for public consumption, but the art is so good that you can't help but like it. When you get posters commissioned, they make the show a little more legendary.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A permanent exhibition of contemporary and vintage rock posters is at the Richard Goodall Gallery, Thomas Street, Manchester.

  "<p>Passengers using Gatwick airport were today advised to check in as normal despite another strike by baggage handlers in a long running dispute over workloads and the suspension of a union official. </p> <p>Servisair, the ground handling firm which employs the workers, said contingency plans would be put in place again to deal with the 12-hour walkout from 8am. </p> <p>A similar strike on Tuesday failed to disrupt flights, with a fifth of departures leaving early, said the company. </p> <p>A spokesman said he was confident there would be few delays today and urged passengers to turn up as normal. </p> <p>The Transport and General Workers Union claimed Servisair had spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on contingency plans during previous strikes. </p> <p>\"The T&amp;G is determined to get a settlement to this dispute,\" said regional officer Madeleine Richards. \"But the only way we feel we can bring Servisair back to the negotiating table and to get them to talk constructively is to continue to show them they are out of step with their workforce. </p> <p>\"This is a costly dispute for Servisair as they ignore their clients elsewhere to bring managers in on strike days. The support from our members remains strong and committed to taking more strike action if that is necessary.\" </p> <p>Ms Richards added: \"Servisair are losing thousands of pounds every hour of a strike and if they, like us, want us to resolve this dispute they must play their part in sorting it out. </p> <p>\"We need constructive talks, and that means coming up with realistic proposals that address the causes of the action.\"</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United today issued a terse response to the protesters who disrupted last night's reserve team match in Altrincham as part of their efforts to block any takeover by American billionaire Malcolm Glazer. </p> <p>Supporters calling themselves the Manchester Education Committee invaded the pitch for three minutes, brandishing a \"Not For Sale\" banner in front of MUTV cameras. </p> <p>United issued a short statement which read: \"Encroaching on the field of play is against the law. The club does not condone what happened last night. It would be unacceptable at a first team game and it is unacceptable for the reserves.\" </p> <p>United refused to comment on threats by the MEC that they would activate a \"civil war\" if supporters' views were ignored in any takeover situation. </p> <p>The group were also responsible for disrupting a race meeting at Hereford earlier this year during Sir Alex Ferguson's feud with Irish racing moguls John Magnier and JP McManus. Two days ago, United director Maurice Watkins had red paint splashed over his car in retribution for a million of his shares being passed on to Glazer. </p> <p>The supporters believe Glazer does not have sufficient funds to take over the club and would pay off resulting loans by hiking admission prices. They apparently targeted the reserve match to redress the balance after what was perceived as a pro-Glazer interview on MUTV earlier this week. </p> <p>Glazer has so far refused to confirm he made the initial approach to United last week seeking clarification of a number of issues relating to a possible buy-out.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Laurence, 40, is an illegal downloader</strong></p> <p> I was told about WinMX by someone at work. I've downloaded thousands of singles and hundreds of individual music videos since then. </p> <p>I go back to my early teens when I listened to the top 40 on the radio and taped songs from the radio before eventually going out and buying them. To me, downloading is exactly the same. I will go online and download songs three or four times a week, using WinMX. I've looked at other sites, like KaZaA, but it wasn't right for me. I'm not that computer literate and WinMX is very accessible. </p> <p>My sons download as well. They will download singles for an hour or so, then I will go online at about 10pm after they have gone to bed. That's when the American market opens up. You tend to get more interesting material coming on in the early hours, like US releases. The new Chris Robinson solo album is the big one at the moment. He is the former lead singer of the Black Crowes and his album isn't being released in the UK, so a lot of people want it. </p> <p>On the video side, there's amazing Grateful Dead and Led Zeppelin concerts from the 60s available online. </p> <p>I've never burnt a CD and sold it on. It isn't done. You just do it for your own use. I probably spend more on music now since I started downloading. A lot of people I know who download say the same thing. </p> <p>The quality from illegal file-sharing networks is not as good, which is why if you like what you are downloading you buy it eventually. I downloaded the Libertines' new album the other week. I've got broadband so I can do it in minutes. </p> <p>The record companies' argument is a load of rubbish. They are doing extremely well at the moment and people are spending more money on music through downloading. </p> <p>I was under the impression they will only really go for downloaders who are doing it 24/7. But people who are much more computer literate will find ways around it. I'm going to stick with what I'm doing and see what happens.

Don't take my word for it, listen to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1320842,00.html\">Greg</a>. It is truly a spectacular game, regardless of Peter Molyneux's self-critical apologies for not reaching the state of the divine that he would have liked. For us mere mortals it will do just nicely.</p> <p>If anything, Fable is the precursor to Massively Multiplayer Online Games on consoles. While it exists solely offline, somehow the collective creative genius of Big Blue Box studios has developed a title which keeps the social elements of human interaction alive in computerised AI. Take on the mantle of Hero and choose your destiny. As with all of Molyneux's titles, be good or evil. You decide. Great for us control freaks. XBox only.</p> <p>Pikmin 2 gets my silver medal this week, primarily because it's booted Fable off the television screen since Tuesday (much to my chagrin). Little has changed in the formula of this macro-puzzle gardening-simulation from the creator of Mario and Zelda. You're still on a foreign planet, you still have to plant and grow little seed dudes called Pikmin. A couple of nice additions though: you can delegate many of the menial tasks to your trusty assistant and you can wander at will. Time is, erm, no object. Re-play value is still low, but Pikmin 2's great for brain exercise after a long day. GameCube only.</p> <p>Jackie Chan Adventures is a pretty straightforward take on the hit kids' cartoon series. As an action adventure title, players are charged with solving puzzles, finding talismans and kicking comedy butt against the evil that stands in the way. Some of the EyeToy games are quite literally hilarious, and this is the first title for which smacking bad guys in the face with your booty is appropriate. It's only available on PS2.</p> <p>And finally, the football games kick off the season (is it the season?!) on every console known to man and woman. First up is FIFA 2005, featuring the <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/games/archives/game_culture/2004/09/rock_n_roll_into_games_will_go.html\">well-publicised</a> contributions of DJ Paul Oakenfold.

  "<b>This is not going to be a simple, straightforward election, is it?</b> <p> It is not: the Taliban are threatening bombings, the warlords might try to rig some of the voting, much of the electorate is illiterate and has never voted before, and roads and communications are poor over the vast terrain. </p> <p>The candidate expected to win is the current, unelected transitional president, Hamid Karzai, who has been more or less holed up in his secure compound in the capital, Kabul, after coming under fire on a helicopter trip last month. </p> <p>Mr Karzai's 17 rival candidates - an ethnically diverse group - include warlords with some very questionable backgrounds in terms of human rights, one woman, and a poet, Latif Pedram.</p> <p>The UN estimates 90% of the Afghan electorate may vote, with about 40% of the voters being women. But it has encountered an anomaly: the UN thinks 9.5 million people are eligible to vote, but eyebrows were arched after 10.5 million actually registered. During polling, hands will be inked to try and stop multiple voting. </p> <p>That is because in modern Afghanistan, some of the solutions still have to be low tech. The UN organisers of the vote have hired 5,000 mobile phones, 1,150 Russian jeeps, four helicopters and a cargo plane but also some 300 donkeys. </p> <p>And it will be by donkey that the ballot box from one polling station in the Hindu Kush mountains will be delivered - two weeks after the polls have closed. </p> <p>Official electoral monitors are only several hundred strong, and the legwork manning and returning ballot boxes from the 22,000 polling stations will be done by the 114,000 local staff hired by the UN, which is spending \u00a3111m on the election.</p> <p>David Avery, who is in charge of the UN's joint electoral management body, admitted that not every ballot box was going to make it. He told the Guardian: \"In the end, you count what you get.\"</p> <p>It is hoped that most Afghans will enjoy their taste of democracy. </p> <p> <b>Will the election be fair? </b> </p> <p>There has been widespread violence against election officials, and a dozen election workers have so far been killed in shootings and bombings. </p> <p>US and Nato troops are patrolling the capital and countryside, leaving it to thousands of newly trained Afghan national police and army troops to guard candidates and polling stations.</p> <p>A UN report warned that local warlords could use guns to intimidate both voters and candidates. It also suggested that a lack of information and understanding about how the elections work, especially in rural areas, where many people are illiterate, could hinder a fair outcome. </p> <p><b>How bad is the security situation?</b></p> <p> More than 1,000 people have died in violence over the last year, making it the deadliest since the US-led invasion ousted the Taliban. Mr Karzai postponed the presidential election - originally scheduled to take place in June - until October, and the parliamentary elections until next spring in order to avoid voters being frightened from the polls by bloodshed. </p> <p>The Taliban has vowed to step up attacks ahead of the election, and on August 30 a car bomb ripped through the offices of a US security company in Kabul, killing 10 people. </p> <p>The Pakistani president, Pervez Musharaff, has promised to stop the remnants of the Taliban launching raids into Afghanistan from bases inside Pakistan, but Afghan leaders say this is still happening.</p> <p>In September 2002, Mr Karzai survived an assassination attempt in the former Taliban stronghold of Kandahar. Several organisations, including M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, have withdrawn from Afghanistan following unprecedented attacks on aid workers. </p> <p>On Wednesday October 6, just three days before the polls open, a convoy carrying Mr Karzai's vice-presidential running mate, Ahmed Zia Massood, was attacked by a roadside bomb. Mr Massood was unharmed but one man died. </p> <p><b>How does it work and who are the main candidates? </b></p> <p>Voters will choose between 18 candidates for a five-year term of office. If none of those candidates wins a simple majority, a run-off election in November will determine a final winner. The main candidates are: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Hamid Karzai. The transitional president was appointed in 2002 by the loya jirga (grand assembly). He speaks several Afghan languages and comes from the country's largest ethnic group, the Pashtun. However, the country's security situation is dire: opium production has exploded, and most Afghans live in abject poverty and have little access to healthcare. However, voters may not have expected Mr Karzai to solve in only three years the problems caused by almost three decades of war. Afghanistan also needs foreign funds, and his urbane dignity goes down well with international donors. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Yunus Qanuni. Mr Karzai's education minister, is best placed to defeat him at the polls. Mr Qanuni served as a the leader of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance and is a member of the country's second largest ethnic group, the Tajiks. He has two powerful backers in Mr Karzai's defence minister, Mohammed Fahim, and the former foreign minister, Abdullah Abdullah.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Massouda Jalal. The only female candidate on the list, Ms Jalal is a former UN worker and a qualified paediatrician. She is independent of any faction, but that means she lacks a power base. She came a distant second to Mr Karzai at the loya jirga in 2002. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Mohammed Mohaqeq. Formerly an anti-Taliban militia commander, Mr Mohaqeq is from the long-suffering Shia Muslim Hazara minority of central Afghanistan. He served as planning minister in Mr Karzai's government until March, when he insists he was ejected from the cabinet because of his candidacy. He could overshadow Mr Karzai's less popular Hazara vice-presidential nominee. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Abdul Rashid Dostum. A ruthless Uzbek warlord, he has a reputation as a serial betrayer, having allied himself with almost every Afghan leader over the past two decades. He fought both with and against the Soviets during the 1980s, and with the Taliban until joining the Northern Alliance, which helped the US oust its regime in late 2001.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Abdul Satar Serat. An Uzbek and a former aide to Afghanistan's last king, Mr Serat has spent most of the past 30 years in exile. Many believed that the intellectual nationalist would head up the post-Taliban interim government, but Mr Karzai, backed by the US, took the post. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Abdul Hafiz Mansoor. The traditionalist former head of Aghan state television, Mr Mansoor put on a rabble-rousing display at the loya jirga, which passed Afghanistan's new constitution in January. He has links with the Tajik faction in the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance and has accused Mr Karzai of attempting to install an elected dictatorship. He stirred up anger by ordering a ban on women singing on air. </p> <p><b>Will the winner actually control the country? </b> </p> <p>Some of Mr Karzai's opponents refer to him derisively as the \"mayor of Kabul\". He has not taken on the warlords, who have largely refused to disarm, but has instead negotiated alliances with them. </p> <p>Any new president will have the backing of around 18,000 US-led troops and 8,000 Nato-led peacekeepers. Disarming regional factions, however, remains the key to creating a single country under a central government. An estimated 50,000 armed militia members are attached to warlords across the country.

  "<p>Fifa Football 2004 was EA Sports' nadir. Its chief innovation was an unusable \"after-touch\" gimmick, which it spent so long developing it was not finished properly in time for release. So fundamental features, such as the ability to alter the game's speed, were omitted. </p> <p>Happily, this year's effort is much better - although not good enough to reclaim top spot. The after-touch control has been ripped out and a more useful first-touch control, operated using the right analogue stick, installed. </p> <p>Excellent graphics, an improved, more realistic passing system, a free-kick system that operates in a logical manner and a Pro Evolution Soccer-like press-and-hold shooting system constitute the game's highlights. There is also support for online play across all platforms now that EA has begun to support Xbox Live. </p> <p>A career mode, in which you take the reins of a lowly club and work your way up to the Premiership, or favourite global league, is an intriguing addition, but controlling players who would be more at home on Hackney Marshes proves frustrating. </p> <p>However, there are still areas in which Pro Evolution Soccer remains superior - namely, off-the-ball player movement when going forward, and automatic player selection. This year's Pro Evolution Soccer will also be available for the Xbox. Fifa Football 2005 marks a return to form, but it is no undisputed world-beater.</p>",
  "<p>Tower Hamlets council was today accused of trying to gag debate on the future of its homes after it pulled an advertisement for a conference about housing investment in its weekly newspaper.</p> <p>Tenants' group Tower Hamlets Against Transfer of Council Housing (Thatch) claims the decision to pull the advert from East End Life is part of a dirty tricks campaign by the council to silence opposition to its plan to sell off the borough's homes. </p> <p>Tower Hamlets is keen to transfer the remainder of its council homes to a series of housing associations as a way of improving the properties to a decent standard.</p> <p>But it needs to secure the backing for the plan in tenant ballots, and there is significant local opposition to transfer in the area. </p> <p>Tower Hamlets only narrowly secured a tenants' vote in favour of the transfer of five of its estates this summer after removing Thatch's anti-transfer posters from estates under antisocial behaviour legislation.</p> <p>Now Thatch wants to raise awareness about a conference it is hosting at the end of the month which it bills as an \"opportunity to hear both sides of the argument about stock transfer\".</p> <p>The speakers include housing academic Professor Peter Ambrose and Labour MP Harry Barnes.</p> <p>Thatch's Myra Garrett, who had tried to place the advertisement, was initially told that the wording complied with East End Life's terms and conditions for advertisers. But she was later informed that it had been pulled. </p> <p>A spokesman for the council said there were \"unresolved issues\" about running the advertisement, but refused to elaborate. He did confirm that the decision was made after discussion with the borough's chief executive, Christine Gilbert. But he claimed that the advertisement could still be run in next week's issue.</p> <p>Ms Garrett said: \"The housing minister, Keith Hill, has promised to ensure a fair debate about housing choice and that tenants should be given all the information about the options for their housing. Tower Hamlets' action seems to violate that promise.\"</p> <p>She added: \"We are being gagged.\"</p> <p>The row comes after Camden council dropped its attempt to fine Alan Walter, the national coordinator of the Defend Council Housing campaign, for flyposting anti-transfer posters to a bus shelter during the borough's landmark ballot on the future of Camden's homes.</p>",
  "Some fashion designers achieve success by jumping on the bandwagon of the latest look. Stella McCartney has done almost the exact opposite. Since launching her own-name label three years ago, she has stuck to an aesthetic that has sometimes looked perplexingly out of step with fashion. <p>But despite being pilloried in the press for her early collections, the lady has not been for turning. The combination of a famous surname that keeps the press interested and the financial backing of the Gucci Group has helped McCartney to stand her ground. And now it seems that the rest of the fashion world is coming round to her viewpoint. </p> <p>The drop-shouldered, slouchy silhouette that has been a McCartney signature ever since she parted company from her Chloe design partner Phoebe Philo is now echoed on catwalks worldwide. </p> <p>Jackets have shoulder seams cut very low, so that they disappear into full sleeves which are then gathered at the elbow, creating a soft bow shape across the top of the body. </p> <p>The bottom half is low-slung, hands-in-pockets insouciant rather than look-at-me sexy: slouchy cropped trousers worn with high heels. It is a look that is still some way ahead of the high street, but the Milan catwalks last week showed definite signs of moving in Stella's direction. </p> <p>This collection bore all the trademarks. There was, of course, the kind of paparazzi-friendly front row that less well-connected designers can only dream of: her father, Chrissie Hynde, and Gwyneth Paltrow. </p> <p>And then there were the clothes: the pale grey Prince of Wales check trousers that have been a constant in her collections since her early, pre-Chloe days as a small-scale London designer; the lingerie detailing, with bras showing beneath low-cut dresses; and the silk-and-chiffon obsession that always shines through, this season in a beautiful lace-edged blouse. </p> <p>McCartney has always used ideas from men's tailoring. Inspired by the bespoke Tommy Nutter three-piece trousersuits owned by her mother, Linda, she did a work experience stint on Savile Row while studying at St Martins College in London. </p> <p>This season, a mannish white shirt was topped with a slim waistcoat; a black satin tuxedo jacket was cropped bolero-short at the front, with mini-tails; and the Sgt Pepper jacket, another McCartney favourite, appeared in flimsy white silk with matching trousers. </p> <p>A committed animal lover, McCartney has developed a range of vegetarian accessories. Her non-leather shoes are becoming a cult purchase, and next season's wooden soled high-heeled espadrilles look likely to be a hit. </p> <p>There was a second British designer, Hussein Chalayan, on the Paris fashion week schedule yesterday. As the audience waited for his show, a rumour went round that he had had \"a Versace moment\". </p> <p>This was an intriguing idea, as Chalayan is famed for determinedly intellectual, deliberately difficult collections. </p> <p>To begin with, hybrid garments - half waistcoat, half jacket - came in Chalayan's muted black and grey palette. Models looked like chic sleepwalkers, in pyjama-striped shirtdresses; others wore oversized open-knit sweater dresses, or long tailored shorts. </p> <p>But the eveningwear did indeed have an unexpected va va voom. A wave-print indigo chiffon dress had sexy keyhole cutouts on either side of the waist, and a flirty short hemline. The final dress, a veritable micro-frock of sashaying inky blue bugle beads, with a neckline that plunged to the navel to expose an elegant sufficiency of cleavage, was wolf-whistle material.</p> <p><b>Trendwatch: Purse bags</b></p> <p><b>What to look out for in the shops for spring and summer 2005</b> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Carrying the tiniest handbag, the size of an average wallet or make-up bag, is fashion's latest mode of power dressing. A tiny handbag suggests that you have an extremely expensive, extremely small mobile phone. It conjures up images of a driver waiting just outside in a purring Bentley, obviating the pesky need to carry an umbrella or a cardigan.

  "<p>Children as young as nine have more manufactured chemicals in their blood than their grandparents and these substances are suspected of disrupting development and hormones, according to tests on seven volunteer families across the country. </p> <p>Eighty manufactured chemicals were detected in blood tests for 104 substances on 33 people. Children were found to have 75 in their blood, as did their parents, but their grandmothers only had 56. The children also had higher concentrations of some chemicals. </p> <p>The substances tested for are known to be building up in the environment and include brominated flame retardants used in furniture and televisions, and perfluorinated chemicals used in the manufacture of non-stick pans and stain resistant treatments for carpets and clothing. </p> <p>A campaign to restrict the use of chemicals which accumulate in the blood - backed by the WWF (formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature), the Women's Institute and the Co-operative bank - is trying to get the European Union to toughen its stance. </p> <p>Justin Woolford, WWF's chemicals and health campaign director, said: \"These results are extremely worrying because of the unknown long-term health effects of the majority of industrial chemicals people are exposed to. The contamination of three generations of UK families ... illustrates that industry and government have failed to control these chemicals. The UK and the European Union must ... ensure that these chemicals are banned and replaced with safer alternatives.\" </p> <p>Eighty-two per cent of the people tested had at least one perfluorinated chemical in their blood; DEHP, which is a suspected hormone-disrupting chemical used in plastics, PVC flooring, food packaging and toiletries was found in more than 75%. </p> <p>Chemicals such as PCBs and DDE, a breakdown product of DDT, were found in everyone despite being banned in the UK at least a decade before the children were born, but on average the older generations had higher concentrations. </p> <p>BDE, a brominated flame retardant, was found in seven people in the survey, most of whom were children. </p> <p>The families tested were from Edinburgh, Welshpool, Manchester, Stourport, Gloucester, south Devon and Suffolk. </p> <p>Kate Daley, campaigns manager for the Co-operative bank, said: \"For most parents their child's health and well being is paramount, but sadly our latest research reveals that our children are being contaminated ... there is little we can do to prevent it. We want to see chemicals like these phased out and replaced with safer alternatives before it's too late.\" </p> <p>More than 60 leading independent scientists have signed a declaration calling for measures to reduce exposure to persistent and very bioaccumulative chemicals, and hormone or endocrine disrupting chemicals. </p> <p>The Co-operative bank refuses to invest in companies that \"manufacture chemicals which are persistent in the environment and linked to long term health concerns\". </p> <p>The report, called Contaminated: the next generation, showed connections between the products used by and the diets of those surveyed and the chemicals detected in their blood. </p> <p>For example, it is widely accepted that oily fish contains high levels of PCBs. The highest numbers of these chemicals were found in family members whose diets are high in such foods. </p> <p>Other studies have shown a correlation between the number of electrical appliances in an office and the levels of flame-retardant chemicals in the office air. </p> <p>This may help explain how people become contaminated by these chemicals, the study said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday October 9 2004</strong> </p> <p>East Timor was colonised by the Portuguese and not the Dutch, as we mistakenly say below. </p> <p>  </p> <p> Newspaper headlines are generally designed to terrify the public while the journalists who concoct them remain indifferent. But a story yesterday had the opposite effect; readers shrugged and turned the page while reporters everywhere spluttered on their pints, skipped breakfast and dashed straight to work. \"The outsourcing of journalism,\" declared the Guardian, as the news agency Reuters began shifting its financial coverage to Bangalore. \"This is an outrage!\" said Telegraph leader-writers, who'd just finished an editorial about how British workers must accept pay cuts to compete with call centres in India. \"These Asians...\" ranted the Daily Star hacks - \"they stay over there, and take our jobs!\" </p> <p>Reuters journalists had been writing for some time about how cost-efficient it might be for corporations to take advantage of India's highly educated workforce. At least now they know that their bosses bother to read their stuff. \"Breaking news will continue to be reported from the world's financial centres,\" wrote the media company's press secretary, struggling with the two removal men who were carrying out his desk. \"Journalists miles away from the actual stories?\" exclaimed one outraged cub reporter. \"How will they check for mistakes?\" At which point the entire newsroom looked at him with one eyebrow raised and he was quietly shown the door. </p> <p>Without anyone realising, this has been happening in local newspapers for some time. Trainee journalists in India get to their computers at 8am and by lunchtime have produced all the news stories that you read in your local freesheet. The template is straightforward; the software prompts the operator to make a series of simple choices to create a typical local news report... \"Pensioner mugged for only 10p/50p/\u00a31.20 (delete accordingly). \"A cowardly attack on a local pensioner was carried out in broad daylight/in the park/in this court report I just read/earlier this week. The attacker was wearing a bomber jacket and jeans/a hooded top and trainers/and fled the scene with only ... p (insert pitiful amount here). Police said this was a particularly despicable/shocking/vague/story and are warning pensioners to take extra care/stay inside/not to read their local newspaper and live in permanent terror.\" </p> <p>To balance up this routinely depressing item the would-be journalists are then presented with heart-warming reports such as \"Hospice Hero Cycling to Scotland!\" and \"Brownies Cake Sale Takes the Biscuit!\" to put above \"notice of planning application for new conservatory\". Then they just press \"send\" on their computer and the next day four copies of the local advertiser are pushed through your door. </p> <p>But now the software has been refined so that Indian computer operators can write the stories for British national newspapers too. The subject matter differs according to which newspaper the journalist writes for. Click on the Daily Mail icon and you get the headline \"Asylum Seekers Threat to House Prices\", and the piece pretty well writes itself from there - although the software prevents you deleting the words \"mother of two\", \"fear\" and \"Islamic extremists\". Click on the Sun and you get: \"It's Christine Agui-Leera!\" You just have to write the caption for a photo of an attractive young singer with a low-cut dress and faulty bra. </p> <p>Soon, London will be full of unemployed journalists, Fleet Street's finest former wordsmiths holding up cardboard signs saying \"hungrey and homless - plese halp\". And the placards of the Murdoch crew will include a plug for what's on Sky that night. </p> <p>But this is payback time for centuries of colonisation. Britain occupied India, imposed the English language and left the country significantly poorer, so that 200 years later it is cheaper to get Indians to compile our crosswords and review the new Dido album. Some former colonies are in a better position than others. \"Right,\" says the finance minister of East Timor, \"we're setting up an online news agency.\" </p> <p>\"But we were colonised by Holland. I'm afraid there's not much call for Dutch financial journalism.\" </p> <p>\"Even in the Netherlands?\" </p> <p>\"Nope, they speak better English than the Americans.\" </p> <p>Unless of course this is an elaborate plan to halt immigration. The presumption was always that third world workers hoped to come and work in the paradise that was Europe or America. Give them a few months of learning about the sort of newspapers we read and they'll all be saying: \"Er, actually, I think I'll stay right here, thank you very much.\" </p> <p>Although this column will continue to be credited to John O'Farrell it has now been outsourced to topical comedy writers in southern India. No discernible change in standard is anticipated. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "There is, to the untrained eye, very little between them. Perhaps Londoners with a yen for ensigns and uniforms can distinguish between officers from the Metropolitan police and their counterparts in the City of London force. <p>Few others give the issue much thought. </p> <p>But the demarcation line between two of the main organisations which police London has become a source of frustration for Ken Livingstone, the mayor. </p> <p>Despite the status of the City of London force as a unique entity since 1839, he wants it to be absorbed into the Met, along with the section of the British Transport police responsible for keeping order on the tube. </p> <p>Mr Livingstone has made several approaches to the Home Office and has promised to continue lobbying for a super force which, he says, would police London more efficiently. But that would require legislation. </p> <p>In addition to persuading David Blunkett, he will also have to convince the rank and file, because officers in the Met, City and Transport police oppose what they say is unnecessary meddling. </p> <p>Illogical though the structures may be, they say the present system has served London well and should be preserved. </p> <p>Mr Livingstone outlined his vision to the London assembly. \"On the grounds of efficiency, effectiveness and clarity of accountability, the City of London police, the Royal parks police and British Transport police should be absorbed into the structures of the MPS [Metropolitan police service],\" he said. \"It is important to have a single police force coterminous with the London boundaries, which is able to deliver both on local policing and policing a capital city. I will continue to makerepresentations to the Home Office stating the business case and the benefits to Londoners.\" </p> <p>But police officers think they have just as strong a case for keeping the status quo. Glen Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: \"There is no real benefit in it for us because we would have extra areas to police with not many more to police them with ... it is not as simple as bringing everything into one force. The question should be will it benefit the public and I don't think it would.\" </p> <p>William Parsons, chairman of the City of London Police Federation, said his force and the Met already worked closely. </p> <p>\"That relationship serves everyone very well. We in the City of London provide a high standard of performance. I can't think of a reasonable case to say we should be amalgamated.\" </p> <p>Roger Randall, the general secretary of the British Transport Police Federation, said the loss of the 650 officers policing the tube would probably be the end of the force despite it being a national body. \"This is not government policy and every time it has been looked at it has been decided that this would be the worst possible move for the people of London,\" he said. </p> <p>The corporation of London is the police authority for central London and enjoys good relations with Mr Livingstone. But on this issue there is no consensus. </p> <p>Simon Walsh, chairman of its police committee, said: \"The City of London police does a unique job in a unique place and its special focus on both security and economic crime give it real strength. The current arrangement works well and any merger would risk damaging proven excellence. Security and fighting economic crime are too important to become political footballs.\" </p> <p>He said: \"The Home Office recently recognised the City of London police as the lead regional force in investigating serious economic crime and we have won extra resources for this work.\" </p> <p>Daniel Whittle-Harvey, the first commissioner of the City of London police, was responsible for about 500 men when he was appointed in 1839.</p> <p>A successor to the 13th century Watch, today's service has about 1,200 employees covering the City of London. It is dwarfed by the Met, which has 30,568 officers and an overall workforce of 43,000 people responsible for law and order in Greater London. </p> <p>John O'Connor, a former head of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, said most Met officers have always respected the abilities of their colleagues in the City. But many also considered the force itself as too small to be credible. </p> <p>\"One very senior officer was once quoted as saying that if he was in charge of the City he would put a sergeant in charge and then forget about it. That sums up the attitude of many,\" he said. </p> <p>He said the relative wealth of the City force has always been evident. \"They have much better equipment than the Met. Whatever they want they go to the City fathers and they get it quickly. Met officers always find they have to wait.\" </p> <p>Donald Rumbelow, who wrote I Spy Blue, a history of the City of London force, said there has been \"banter\" between officers from the two entities since Victorian times but even now the ties still bind. </p> <p>\"There is a tremendous amount of integration between the two forces,\" he said. \"There is no advantage to be gained from merging the two. Out on the street they are all police officers.\"</p>",
  "<p>A hardcore group of militant Manchester United supporters last night threatened to declare \"civil war\" on the club after disrupting a reserves match as their latest protest against Malcolm Glazer's proposed takeover. </p> <p>Forty fans interrupted Louis Saha's comeback match when they invaded the pitch at Altrincham's Moss Lane ground with a huge banner reading \"Not for Sale\". The reserves fixture between United and Birmingham City was held up for five minutes. </p> <p>The same group, going by the name of the Manchester Education Committee (MEC), is believed to be responsible for an incident at the home of the United director Maurice Watkins on Monday night, when paint was thrown over his car. Watkins was targeted after selling one million shares to Glazer. </p> <p>Information has been passed to the Guardian that other directors, notably Nick Humby and Andy Anson, are being seen as legitimate targets. The MEC believes both men are not averse to the idea of Glazer taking control. Likewise the group is also planning operations against Brunswick, Glazer's appointed PR company in London, and the former sports editor of the Sun Paul Ridley, who has been advising the American multi-millionaire about his media relations. </p> <p>Acts of violence have not been ruled out and United are fully aware that it is not merely the work of a few individuals but a well organised group armed with addresses, contact details and inside information. </p> <p>In a statement the MEC said last night: \"For far too long the wishes of Manchester United fans, and football fans in general, have been ignored as clubs sacrifice everything at the altar of commercialism. </p> <p>\"The Manchester Education Committee would like to stress that in the event of the wishes of Manchester United supporters being ignored in any takeover situation, we intend to initiate a civil war effectively setting the football club - the supporters - against the company. In such a situation it is our intention to render the club ungovernable and actively disrupt all manner of commercial activity associated with Manchester United.\" </p> <p>Pointedly it added: \"The club's sponsors and commercial partners should note that the Manchester Education Committee will view them as legitimate targets. For now we would like to encourage United fans to carry on with the targeting of Brunswick, which has been ongoing in recent days.\" </p> <p>United are taking the threats seriously, knowing the same group was behind the disruption at a race meeting at Hereford in February. Then, the MEC was protesting against the club's majority shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who were involved in a legal battle with the manager Sir Alex Ferguson. </p> <p>Another event organised by MEC is scheduled for this weekend in Manchester and the group then intends to switch its attention to Glazer himself. </p> <p>United, meanwhile, are demanding an explanation from Fifa after an article in an official publication included several very serious claims about their manager. United are furious and are writing to the organisation through the FA claiming that it is \"totally inaccurate\". </p> <p>Asked about the article, a Fifa spokesman pointed out a statement in the publication which reads: \"Any views expressed do not necessarily reflect those of Fifa.\"</p>",

  "<p>These two plays in the RSC's New Work Festival have a lot in common. Both are by young women. Both take place in a world rent by catastrophe. Both use blindness as a metaphor. But where Zinnie Harris's Midwinter has the force of a moral fable, Joanna Laurens's Poor Beck is a confusing allegory. </p> <p>Harris's play starts ominously with a young woman, Maud, dragging a dead horse on stage: instead of flogging it, however, as I half feared, she barters it for a starving, silent child. And when her lover, long presumed dead, returns from an unnamed war she passes the boy off as their own. What follows is a strangely gripping story in which Maud battles for possession of the child with his natural grandfather and the soldier is afflicted by a blindness-inducing parasite. </p> <p>I was reminded strongly of Edward Bond, in that Harris uses potently direct language to create a complex parable. War, she implies, destroys not only civilisations but our own sense of personal identity; the soldier returns from battle with an acquired violence, Maud becomes an habitual deceiver, and the boy is stripped of speech. </p> <p>But abstraction is kept at bay by Harris's own rivetingly specific production, in which Ruth Gemmell, combining maternal longing with manipulative shrewdness, gives a thrilling performance as the multi-faceted Maud. Pal Aron as the blinded soldier and John Normington as the tenacious grandad are equally good. </p> <p>If Harris is in control of her imagination, Laurens has allowed hers to run away with her. What she has done in Poor Beck is to relocate an Ovidian incest myth, in which Myrrha sleeps with her kingly father, to a postapocalypse universe. I could not help feeling, however, that if mankind were driven underground by a nuclear or ecological disaster, preservation of normal family standards would be the least of its problems. </p> <p>Admittedly the whole thing is staged with great flair by Daniel Fish, and Greg Hicks as the blind patriarch shows he can give even the simplest line a keening resonance. </p> <p>But all Laurens's play, which has already finished its brief run, proves is that classical myth and futurist nightmare make queasily strange bedfellows. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Midwinter at The Swan until October 16.

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's roundup of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>AT LEAST 19 DEAD IN EGYPT RESORT BLASTS</b></p> <p>Several bombs exploded last night at resorts on Egypt's Red Sea coast, killing at least 19 people and injuring two Britons. The news came too late for most of the first editions. According to the Associated Press, two blasts at the Taba Hilton were followed by two smaller explosions in other Sinai resorts. Most of the dead and injured were holidaying Israelis and Egyptians.</p> <p>AP also reports that a small bomb planted outside the Indonesian embassy in Paris injured nine people this morning.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,1322786,00.html\">Dozens killed in Egypt bomb blasts</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/graphic/0,5812,1322805,00.html\">Map: where the blasts occurred</a></p> <p><b>COURT RULES DOCTORS MUST LET BABY DIE</b></p> <p>A high court judge ruled yesterday that Charlotte Wyatt, the gravely ill 11-month-old baby whose parents wanted to keep her alive for as long as possible, must be left to die the next time she stops breathing.</p> <p>Charlotte herself, who is unable to move of her own free will, appears to stare from the front pages of the Times and the Telegraph. Breathing tubes are attached to her nose. In fact, she is blind, deaf and suffers from chronic breathing and kidney problems and profound brain damage.</p> <p>Mr Justice Hedley told the high court he was \"only too aware of my own limitations in making so momentous a decision\". It was clear, he said, that Charlotte was in pain. Whether she could experience pleasure no one knew, though doctors doubted it.</p> <p>\"This case evokes some of the fundamental principles that undergird our humanity. They are not found in acts of parliament or decisions of the courts but in the deep recesses of the common psyche of humanity.\"</p> <p>He said he had considered how, and not if, Charlotte should die, and concluded that she deserved as \"good\" a death as would ever be possible. \"Everyone in this case knows what it means - not under anaesthetic, not in the course of painful and futile treatment, but peacefully in the arms of those who love her most.\"</p> <p>\"We're not happy about the decision but we accept it,\" Charlotte's father said yesterday. \"When the moment comes, we will let her die in our arms.\"</p> <p>Most of the papers endorse the ruling. \"I too have felt such pain. But sometimes love means letting go,\" writes Bel Mooney in the Mail. The Times, however, has reservations, saying the case should never have reached the high court.</p> <p>\"Everyone involved in the case of Charlotte Wyatt has behaved honourably,\" the paper says. \"Darren and Debbie Wyatt are portrayed in some quarters as zealots, misled by their own faith and by implausible belief in miracles. They are presumed blind to the dire state of their little daughter, whom they should surely allow to die in peace and with dignity. This is an unfair caricature of their position. ... They accepted that the hope held out by the medical evidence is limited. They endorsed a compromise by which Charlotte might receive an elective tracheostomy. If after any future five days of ventilation she still had high oxygen requirements and made no improvement, they would concede it would be right to stop ventilation.

Rather than focus on the big picture - there were no WMD - much of the briefing has diverted media attention on to claims that Saddam intended to buy the favour of nations such as France, Russia and China, and individuals, including the expelled Labour MP George Galloway.

  "Taiwan's independence-minded president, Chen Shui-bian, is promising that his National Day address on Sunday will soothe tensions with China that have ratcheted up dangerously in recent months. <p>But conciliatory words from President Chen, or even an attempt to revive a bilateral dialogue frozen since 1999, cannot shield Taiwan from accelerating, adverse geopolitical and economic shifts involving the Asian region, the US and the EU. </p> <p>Rarely since the 1949 break with the mainland, which Beijing never accepted, has Taiwan's attempt to coexist peacefully but separately looked so problematic. </p> <p>\"There is a possibility that China and Taiwan are now approaching the moment of truth,\" said the Japanese commentator Masahiro Wakabayashi. </p> <p>Developments inside China, in particular last month's consolidation of Hu Jintao's leadership, are key to the shifting strategic balance. President Hu's \"peaceful rise\" approach to China's advancement may in time herald a more enlightened policy. But for now he is maintaining a tough stance on Taiwan. </p> <p>\"You must seize the moment and do a good job preparing for a military struggle,\" Mr Hu told the People's Liberation Army recently. This \"struggle\" currently includes the deployment of hundreds of missiles across the Taiwan Strait. </p> <p>Speaking at the UN last month, China's foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, bluntly warned Taiwan's regional neighbours to keep their noses out of China's business. \"The separatist activities of the Taiwanese authorities pose a serious threat ... to the peace of the Asia-Pacific region,\" Mr Li said. In other words: mess with us on Taiwan and you will all be in big trouble. </p> <p>Australia and Singapore have certainly got the message. Both countries recently told Taiwan not to expect help if it got into a shooting war with China. </p> <p>Singapore's leader, Lee Hsien Loong, warned in August of \"a real risk of miscalculation and mishap\". If it came to a fight, no Asian country would support Taiwan. \"Unfortunately, very few Taiwanese leaders understand this,\" he said. </p> <p>Taiwan's foreign minister, Chen Tan-sun, subsequently accused Singapore of \"hugging China's balls\". </p> <p>All this might not matter so much if Taiwan could count on unambiguous US backing. But Washington is preoccupied with Iraq and the \"war on terror\" and already has one Asian \"crisis\" on its hands, with North Korea. </p> <p>The US is urging Taiwan to take more responsibility for its own defence, in part by agreeing to buy a $18bn US arms package (about \u00a310bn), or risk becoming \"a liability rather than a partner\", in the words of a senior official. </p> <p>Ironically, Taiwan's recently disclosed development of offensive missile capabilities and its talk of creating a \"balance of terror\" is partly responsible for Beijing's renewed antagonism. But it is China's growing economic clout that may ultimately prove decisive in influencing US policy as well as that of Taiwan's neighbours. </p> <p>China has been dubbed the new workshop of the world. Its rapid economic expansion is driving Asian and global growth; it is set to become the world's biggest importer and exporter. Its GDP is projected to surpass that of the US and all others by 2050. </p> <p>Whatever it thinks about China's policies on Taiwan, Tibet and human rights, the US increasingly cannot afford to ignore Beijing's aspirations. Much the same goes for the EU which this year will become China's biggest trading partner. This provides the context for Jacques Chirac's state visit, beginning today. </p> <p>The French president is touting for business. But, by going to China, President Chirac, an arch opponent of what he sees as American global hegemony, is also demonstrating to the US that France, and the rest of Europe, have alternative strategic options. </p> <p>This is a new version of the old superpower game of \"playing the China card\". That point will also be underscored by today's Asia-Europe meeting in Hanoi. </p> <p>Mr Chirac says talk of independence in Taiwan is \"irresponsible\". And he is pushing for the EU's post-Tiananmen embargo on arms sales to be lifted. That raises the extraordinary prospect of the US arming Taiwan while the EU arms China. </p> <p>It is against this hazardous backdrop that Mr Chen will speak on Sunday. Taiwan and China have their own substantial economic ties. Both sides say they want a peaceful solution. But no one knows how to achieve it. Approaching Taiwanese legislative elections may inflame the situation. And whether Mr Chen realises it or not, Taiwan's freedom of manoeuvre is rapidly diminishing.</p>",
  "The police in Brixton are outraged. The community in Brixton is outraged and the Community Consultative Group, which links police and people together, has written a furious letter to Michael Howard. <p>It was this section in Howard's conference speech that caused the trouble: \"Three weeks ago on a Saturday night, I went out on the streets of Brixton. I saw the problem their community is up against. In two hours we didn't meet a single policeman, not one. This was inner-city London just before midnight, on a Saturday night. No wonder people feel the police have become distant and remote.\" </p> <p>Leave aside the unpleasant \"black mugger\" racist overtones in choosing Brixton in the first place, just look at his failure - yet again - to do the most rudimentary research. A cursory phone call would have revealed the excellent state of genuine community policing here. (Did he even forget that Lambeth is now run by his own Tories, together with the Lib Dems?) There were plenty of police out and it was a very low crime night: one robbery, one burglary and one serious incident all that Saturday night. Michael Howard must have been one of the scarier midnight things roaming around Electric Avenue. </p> <p>Here is why they are so angry with him. Crime in Brixton has been dropping like a stone. In the last year alone robbery is down by 21.5% - 330 fewer street robberies. Burglary is down by 16.8% and car crime by 21.9%. There were 2,000 fewer crimes this year and that comes on top of three years of falling figures: robbery dropped by 36% the previous year, remarkable results year after year. </p> <p>This is what Detective Chief Inspector Glynn Jones of Brixton said to me with angry relish - firmly on the record: \"Basically, Mr Howard, go and shove it. If you want a lesson in leadership and delivery you could get it from no one better than Lambeth borough Commander Richard Quinn, awarded the Queen's Police Medal and one of the masterminds behind the London-wide Operation Safer Streets\". </p> <p>At the last community consultative meeting, an elderly Brixton resident got up to say he had never in 50 years known the place feel safer - and he was outraged by Howard's ignorant hit-and-run attack. </p> <p>Lee Jasper, black activist and spokesman for the Community Consultative Group, describes how well things work. When the police go out to arrest a big drug dealer, he goes too, together with others, to reassure local people. They hand out leaflets to explain what's going on. \"As the police frog-march the guy away there is not a murmur. When people see us with the police, they start to say it's a good thing, to get rid of the trouble they've had in the area.\" </p> <p>Now the community has taken over a private house impounded from a convicted drug dealer and turned it into a mini-police station and community centre. \"This is the best partnership and Quinn is the third of three excellent commanders we've had here,\" Jasper says. Where the police knew of 85 crack houses a year ago, now they think there are only five left. </p> <p>So into all this success stalks Michael Howard one dark night, on the prowl for a quick-hit cheap crime story, clueless about any of this. If that is Howard's idea of a new era of political honesty to engender new trust from the people, forget it. </p> <p>Crime is the best reason why politicians often well deserve the deepest distrust. They use it shamelessly to frighten the living daylights out of voters. They do it worst in opposition - Labour was shameless too - but they are scarcely better in office. The Tories this week were at their most unscrupulous: \"Crime is out of control!\" Howard said, lying through his teeth and knowing it. (But note how this barrister weaselled the truth: he didn't actually say \"crime is rising\"). </p> <p>It wouldn't matter much if this were just ordinary ya-boo political mendacity, part of the game. But in stirring up crime panics, politicians are reckless of the real unhappiness they spread. It's not just fear, but that wretched, life-sapping sense that society is beyond saving, all is decay and sadness. It makes people depressed and pessimistic; it is the wicked thing that politicians do quite routinely. And then they wonder where \"trust\" went. If they want trust, they should agree the base line on crime figures and call a truce on scaring the public witless. </p> <p>And witless the public is, through no fault of its own. Two-thirds of people think crime increased in the last two years, half of them think it increased \"a lot\", according to the British Crime Survey. </p> <p>As attentive Guardian readers should know by now, nationally the risk of being a victim of a crime has fallen by 40% since 1995 - the longest continuous fall in crime since 1898. Burglary has fallen by 39% and car crime by 31%. Violence has dropped too, by 24%. </p> <p>The media and opposition parties get away with pretending it is not so, by quoting the police recorded figures, which have been rising due to improvements requiring the police to record more, not less, crime. All reputable, non-partisan crime experts think that the British Crime Survey findings are the ones that more accurately measure the way things are moving, even if no figures ever catch the whole truth. (The BCS asks a sample more than 30 times the size of an ordinary opinion poll if they suffered from crime in the last year: that picks up a far larger total number of crimes than a reliance on the vagaries that determine which crimes get reported to the police.) </p> <p>Of course the arch villain is the media. Newspaper sales and television ratings thrive on fear of crime: the wilful misleading of the public knows no bounds. As a prank the Sun has just sent a removal van to the high court to remove Lord Woolf, in protest at new punishments set out by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. How are Sun readers to know that this council - on which sits Victim Support and other lay members - is bringing not leniency but consistency and transparency to sentencing? Yet again the public is encouraged to think nothing works, the law is mad, and criminals go unpunished in this most punitive of nations. </p> <p>But there is no need to feel sorry for the government if its good crime figures are unknown. Whenever they are likely to be reported, Blair and Blunkett love to rail against yobs and louts and anti-social behaviour, as if the country really was going to the dogs. Blunkett joined the tabloid pack the other day by attacking a judge's decision to let a suspected terrorist out on bail. This playing to the press means people never learn the true facts about crime and punishment. The way crime is used and abused for political gain is one of the worst excrescences of democracy. Let's have no more crocodile tears from politicians about loss of trust - until they start to talk honestly about law and order.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Michael Howard yesterday sent Conservative activists home from their most successful party conference in a decade, after suppressing years of faction-fighting and injecting his supporters with the hope that they might just pull off a sensational election victory against the odds next year. </p> <p>The Tory leader's prospects seem as slender as those of his hero, Winston Churchill, in 1940. But by deploying relentless Churchillian optimism against the odds this week he may finally have ended the long \"War of Thatcher's succession\" and largely reunited his faction-riven party. </p> <p>Mr Howard said he would step down if he became a liability - \"absolutely, no ifs or buts\" - and that the Tories still had a lot of hard work to get their policies across to a disaffected electorate. </p> <p>\"I don't think, if you look back, that we have always used the time we've had in opposition as well as we could or should have done,\" he conceded, in an oblique reference to the traumatic recent years under William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith which culminated in a frenzy of plotting at last year's conference. </p> <p>Mr Howard reminded Labour and Lib Dem voters that only he can defeat Tony Blair. </p> <p>\"To those who voted Labour last time, who dream of a better life, who work hard, but feel let down, I say, come and join us. We are the only choice if you want a government that gives you value for money for the taxes you pay,\" he said in a brief closing mini-speech. </p> <p>To signal his determination the 63-year-old Tory leader left the Bournemouth conference centre to take shadow ministers on a campaign tour in marginal North Dorset where they started delivering the first of 11m election pledge cards. </p> <p>The Tory \"timetable for action\" message, unclear for so long, is being boiled down to five pledges covering the agenda polls and focus groups tell all parties are what matters: discipline in schools; locally run and cleaner hospitals; tougher policies on crime; better control of immigration; and a start towards slimmer government and lower taxes. </p> <p>Mr Howard subjected himself to a friendly TV cross-examination by the veteran broadcaster Michael Brunson, conducted before a packed audience of 1,500 supporters. Mr Howard revealed that it was anger over the turbulent state of the NHS in East Kent that drove him back into frontline politics in 2001 and that his political hero remained the wartime premier. Churchill's defiance of Hitler's Germany when the British Empire stood alone in 1940 stood as a \"huge lesson\" about the difference that one man's will can make.</p> <p>The measure of the challenge Mr Howard and his rivals face was reinforced yesterday when research for the politics website ePolitix.com found that 76% of people have little or no interest in the party conferences. Mr Howard assured whoever was watching on TV that, if elected, he would not seek a fourth term.</p>",
  "<p>Glance at a list of Perrier Comedy Award winners and you'd be forgiven for thinking that women simply aren't funny. Check out the comedy on peak-time television schedules and you would very likely come to the same conclusion. It's not the case, of course, but there does still seem to be a problem in reflecting on the big stage or the small screen just how funny women can be. </p> <p>Radio tends to fare better, though it's a sobering experience searching through the comedy archives on BBC7 for household names on the distaff side. But where new material is concerned, on Radio 4, things are brighter and have long been so. This week brought a poignant reminder of this tradition with the broadcast of <strong> About a Dog</strong> (Radio 4), the realisation of the last project proposed by comedy writer Debbie Barham before her death, at 26, from anorexia last year. She knew all about the different perceptions of men and women where comedy is concerned, mailing her early manuscripts into editors for consideration using her initials rather than her first name so as to bypass likely prejudice. </p> <p>Barham began sending sketches and jokes into radio at 14, and despite writing to great acclaim for television, retained her love of radio's unique comic possibilities. This short series about a dog's-eye view of the human world, scripted by Graeme Garden, suits the medium perfectly and avoids the anthropomorphic schmaltz that visuals would bring to it. The result is a very affectionate tribute to Barham, and one you immediately sense has been a labour of love. It's also superb, gentle comedy in its own right, with Alan Davies excelling as Jack, the four-legged friend who always sounds at least mildly put out and bewildered by human foolishness. </p> <p>While he can't understand sexual foreplay (\"I just trot up,\" he says, \"give it a quick sniff and murmur, 'stand still a minute'. That usually does the trick\"), he has learned that eating his mistress's dinner from the kitchen worktop isn't a popular move. So he licks it instead. \"I can never remember if I like olives,\" he slobbers, sampling her pizza topping. \"No, don't like olives. Actually, that pizza looks better for a bit of a lick - what they call a glaze.\" </p> <p>Chortling along to the very funny stand-up material on <strong> It's That Jo Caulfield Again</strong> (Radio 4), I kept thinking It's That Graham Norton again. But Caulfield was a writer on So Graham Norton, so the echo is really the other way round. This week's topic was weddings. \"Don't you think,\" she mused, \"that some people just seemed to be fated to be together? [Cue dramatic drum roll and deep voice of a priest]: \"Do you, Frankenstein, take this woman, Bride of Frankenstein, to be your lawfully wedded wife?\"</p>",
  "<p>It's amazing what you can get away with by saying it's a social experiment for the telly. Right, darling, I want you to give up your job and start behaving a bit more like a wife. You know, in the old-fashioned sense of the word. That means get in the kitchen, woman. Do some cooking, do the cleaning and, most importantly, do what I tell you to. And while you're at it, perhaps you could start making more of an effort with your appearance, tidy yourself up a bit. Right, it's time for the match. Be a good girl will you, and bring me and the lads a tray of cold beers and nibbles? And shut those bloody kids up. </p> <p>Honestly, that's what they're doing, on <strong> Make Me a Perfect Wife</strong> (Channel 4). Five working women, all from the same Surrey village, give up their paid jobs for a month, along with all of their principles, in order to spend more time making their menfolk happy. On hand are experts to give advice on how to behave, dress, massage and bake sponge cakes. Because, as everyone knows, a sponge cake is what really makes a man happy. </p> <p>Trouble is, the fellas are rubbish at playing the dominant male, so accustomed are they to being walked all over. So off they go for a day with Ken, the ex-fighter pilot, to learn a bit of assertiveness and find their inner man. Ken shows them how to punch through wooden boards, fire a gun, and walk on red-hot coals. After a day with Ken, our men are real men. Kind of. </p> <p>For Sarah and Sam, the experiment doesn't go so well. When Sam gets home from work, to be greeted at the door by Sarah, who's all dolled up and and gorgeous, he just looks suspicious. \"What's going on?\" he asks. \"I'm scared.\" Come on, Sam, where's that inner man? </p> <p>\"We're having our 15 golden minutes when you get home from work,\" explains his wife. </p> <p>\"I'm sorry? Oh, OK,\" says Sam, without much enthusiasm. </p> <p>They sit awkwardly on the sofa together, before Sarah remembers what the relationship expert said. \"Would you like me to rub your shoulders?\" she asks. And then adds, \"dear\". </p> <p>\"I really wouldn't, actually,\" says Sam, with a nervous giggle. And when Sarah disappears into the kitchen to fetch some snacks, he confesses that he'd really much rather spend 15 minutes on his own after work. </p> <p>It doesn't really matter, though, because Sarah can't keep up the act for long. Soon she's nagging at him again, they're bickering away, and they both look happier and more comfortable. Maybe there's a lesson in there somewhere. </p> <p>There was more bickering on <strong> Horizon</strong> (BBC2), of all places. The dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago, when a giant meteorite smashed into Mexico, says Jan Smit. The resulting tsunamis, the forest fire and the soot that obliterated the sun all contributed to wipe them out. That's what happened. </p> <p>No it isn't, says Gerta Keller. </p> <p>Yes it is. No it isn't. Tis. Tisn't. Tis too. You're just saying that, Mr Smit, because your whole reputation depends on your poxy little theory. </p> <p>Keller says that, actually, they went on living for a further 300,000 years after this impact. Both appear to be using the same evidence to support their theories. </p> <p>As it turns out, they may both be wrong. The dinosaurs may have died out through the normal evolutionary process. Or it could have been a combination of all three. Fascinating. </p> <p>There's going to be less bickering on <strong> The Farm</strong> (Five) now that Terry Christian's gone. I'm a bit cross with the public about this. They just don't get it. You don't vote to keep the people you like most, you vote for the people who make the programme most interesting. Get rid of that one who used to be in a boy band. And the one called Jeff who's famous because he used to go out with someone from another reality TV show. </p> <p>But no, first to be kicked off was Lady Victoria Hervey. She did nothing, was posh, and wound everyone up (ie she was brilliant). And now they've gone and got rid of our Terry. Who's going to pick arguments with people now? Or get at Vanilla Ice about the war? Who else would ask Rebecca Loos whether, during her affair with David Beckham, they ever indulged in \"fudge-packing\"? Terry was good value. </p> <p>Oh well, it's too late now. The public have ruined it. Time to switch off.</p>",
  "<p>Mr Justice Hedley's ruling on the fate of baby Charlotte is perhaps one of the most difficult decisions he has ever had to deliver.</p> <p>The man given the job of deciding whether Darren and Debbie Wyatt's seriously ill 11-month-old daughter should be allowed to live or die in peace, has faced many unenviable judgments during his career in family law. </p> <p>As Sir Mark Hedley, he once concluded that an infertile man whose former partner became pregnant after IVF with the sperm of an anonymous donor had the right to be legally regarded as the child's father. His decision is still being disputed. </p> <p>Mr Justice Hedley, who became a high court judge three years ago, is a Christian and has four children - three sons and one daughter. He is also a registered foster parent. </p> <p>Earlier this year, in the aftermath of a \"shaken baby syndrome\" trial, he ruled that a man cleared of killing his baby stepdaughter must still face care proceedings over the custody of his own 15-month-old child. He argued that although the man had no malevolent intent, he was satisfied that his action was culpable and that he should have realised it was potentially dangerous. </p> <p>Two years ago, Mr Justice Hedley warned that a surrogacy case he was hearing demonstrated how the scientific skills used were \"racing ahead of our ethical grasp of issues involved\". </p> <p>He decided that a surrogate mother, who had no biological connection to the twin babies she gave birth to in Britain, would have to fight for their possession in the US, where the husband and wife who arranged the pregnancy lived. </p> <p>He banned the media from identifying the medical staff caring for the child because of fears they would be targeted by pro-life lobbyists. </p> <p>Born in London, he grew up in Africa and was educated at Framlingham College, Suffolk. </p> <p>He joined the University of Liverpool's law school in 1965 and was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1969. In a ceremony at the university last year, Mr Justice Hedley was said to be \"the epitome of a modern judge, in touch with society and its issues\". </p> <p>After spending a year in Sudan, he returned to a pupillage in London before moving back to Liverpool in 1971 to take up a place in chambers. It was in Liverpool that he developed his expertise in law relating to children. </p> <p>He became a recorder in 1988, a circuit judge in 1992 and then a high court judge in the family division. </p> <p>He lists his recreational pastimes in Who's Who as cricket and railways.</p> <p><strong>Right to life</strong></p> <p><strong>Debate and opinion</strong></p> <p>In July this year, Leslie Burke, who has a terminal brain condition, won the right to choose whether he should be artificially fed to prolong his life. </p> <p>He argued that the denial of artificial nutrition could amount to \"inhuman and degrading\" treatment under the European convention on human rights. </p> <p>Seven years ago, a judge overruled an Orthodox Jewish couple who were against a hospital's plans not to resuscitate their terminally ill 16-month-old daughter when she stopped breathing. </p> <p>The guiding question for doctors - and judges - is whether the patient's life is worth living and bearable, or whether it has become so painful as to be intolerable. </p> <p>\"There has been a whole series of cases that have gone to the courts in the past 23 years where patients and doctors have disagreed over a baby or very young child,\" said Prof Margaret Brazier, who chairs a working party set up by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics to examine the issue. <br><strong> Sam Jones</strong></p>",
  "<p>There will be huge and understandable public sympathy for Darren and Debbie Wyatt after yesterday's high court decision that there should be no further life-saving treatment for their 11-month-old daughter Charlotte. Mr Wyatt made a moving plea to the court to give his desperately ill baby the chance to live. The Wyatts have suffered an agonising time since Charlotte was born three months premature. She has never left hospital. Her parents waited three months before they could hold her, and another five before they could give her a bath. A committed Christian, Mr Wyatt said he and his wife believed in miracles and thought their daughter was getting stronger. The hospital was \"not going to change our minds about wanting to keep Charlotte alive\". He even questioned, in an interview in a tabloid paper, whether the courts should be able to intervene. </p> <p>Sensibly, Mr Justice Hadley agreed to hear the arguments in open court, rightly observing that the interests of justice were much more likely to be served by a responsible debate based on full information. That is what the hearing has allowed, and there will be few neutral observers who will disagree with the court's ruling. Charlotte weighed only one pound and measured just five inches at birth. She still only weighs 12lbs and is in a precarious condition, suffering from heart abnormality, recurrent urinary tract infections, worsening kidney functions, and deteriorating respiratory and neurological conditions. She is fed by tubes because she still cannot suck. She will never see, hear, walk, sit or eat properly and will require round-the-clock care at all times.

  "The burly general stood a little uncertainly before the roaring crowd in Mazar-i-Sharif. For 20 years Abdul Rashid Dos-tum had built up a reputation for ruthlessness: the Uzbek general who imposed his will on northern Afghanistan from the turret of a tank. <p>Now, in the approach to the country's presidential election, he had come to politely solicit votes. </p> <p>\"I am here because of you,\" he said. \"I see a future when leaders respect their people. I see peace in Afghanistan.\" </p> <p>Then, in a flourish worthy of any western spin-doctor, he leapt on to a horse and galloped away in the manner of a medieval lord. </p> <p>Almost three years after the US bombed the Taliban out of power promising peace and stability, Afghanistan takes a wavering step towards democracy tomorrow. </p> <p>Seventeen candidates, including the interim leader and runaway favourite, Hamid Karzai, will stand in the presidential election. More than 11 million people in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran have registered to vote. </p> <p>Gen Dostum is the least likely of the putative democrats. Several unsavoury warlords have swapped their fatigues for a politician's shirt, tie and plastic smile, but many find his candidacy galling. </p> <p>A banner over his rostrum proclaimed him a \"kind man\" but local history suggests otherwise. His troops are accused of suffocating hundreds of Taliban prisoners in shipping containers in late 2001, with other alleged abuses including raping young children. But it is feared the gunmen will try to swing the poll his way. </p> <p>Voters fear the warlords more than the Taliban, Human Rights Watch said last week in a report describing a \"pervasive atmosphere of repression and fear\". It singled out Gen Dostum as a specific threat. </p> <p>But local human rights officials have recorded only a handful of cases of intimidation. \"The situation is better than elsewhere in the country,\" said Mobarak Razee of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. \"We are expecting a good election.\" </p> <p>A European official in Mazar said the intimidation appeared to be limited to isolated cases in remote villages. \"The commanders' power seems to be weakened,\" he said. \"People seem to realise this ballot will be secret and free.\" </p> <p>Gen Dostum has run a vigorous drive in an otherwise colourless campaign. Most other candidates have canvassed little in public, spending their time courting tribal leaders over cups of tea or attempting backroom deals with stronger candidates. </p> <p>Mr Karzai has been encased in a security bubble for fear of of Taliban attacks. He held just two rallies before campaigning closed yesterday. </p> <p>But Gen Dostum has taken to the road. He has held 10 big rallies and printed posters in seven languages. Some depict an avuncular politician; some a horseback warrior against a blazing sunset; others a pensive visionary gazing toward the future. </p> <p>The variety reflects his flexible attitude to principle and ideology. Originally a communist trade union official, he changed sides numerous times to maintain his power. \"Communist, mujahideen, Taliban, freedom fighter, now an aspiring democrat - it's a fantastic CV,\" a western diplomat in Kabul said wryly. </p> <p>Known as the Lion of Mazar, Gen Dostum enjoys considerable support among his Uzbek people. Qodratullah, a former militiaman at the Mazar rally, said: \"Nobody wants to fight any more. And Dostum will definitely be our president.\" </p> <p>But Qodratullah will probably be disappointed. Analysts say the general is looking for as many votes as he can get, probably with an eye to a cabinet post. But it remains unclear whether he has broken with his violent past. </p> <p>To qualify as a presidential candidate he had to sever his ties with local commanders. But only about 500 of an estimated 3,000 soldiers have demobilised, and few doubt he remains the de facto leader. </p> <p>\"There's no doubt the soldiers still listen to him,\" Vikram Bhatia, a demobilisation officer, said. \"He's like a god to them.\" </p> <p>Diplomats, analysts and UN officials argue that keeping warlords \"inside the tent\" is crucial to removing the gun from Afghan politics, distasteful as Gen Dostum's past may be. </p> <p>But to the general's battle-hardened soldiers demobilisation is a sensitive topic. </p> <p>This week several dozen officers from his 8 Corps waited to hand in their uniforms at Qala-i-Jangi, the mud-walled military fort outside Mazar. Many said they felt angry and abandoned. </p> <p>\"How will I feed my family now?\" Mohammed Zahir shouted from the barbed wire enclosure. \"The government wants to just leave us in the desert. I don't want my country to be rebuilt. Let it be destroyed as it is.\" </p> <p>The UN says tomorrow's vote will be imperfect but that it is an important first step towards democracy. </p> <p>Officials are learning lessons for the parliamentary elections planned for April, which are expected to be much more keenly contested and more difficult to organise. </p> <p>But tomorrow, Mr Karzai is likely to win easily. The question then will be what role men like the Lion of Mazar will play in his government. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> A blast hit Kabul early this morning when a rocket struck near the US military compound and Nato headquarters. </p> <p>There was no word on casualties, but roads to the base were blocked and US staff were evacuated to a bunker.</p>",
  "Over recent months George Bush has brushed away questions about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction with the words: \"Wait till Charlie gets done.\" Now Charles Duelfer, head of the Iraq Survey Group, has produced his report - and the verdict could not be starker. Its thousand and more pages, painstakingly researched by 1,200 staff, obliterate an entire arsenal of familiar phrases about gathering threats, clear and present dangers, and Condoleezza Rice's catchy but preposterous line about a smoking gun becoming a mushroom cloud. <p>Saddam Hussein, the report concludes, did not have any chemical or biological weapons in 2003. Almost certainly he disposed of any stockpiles 12 years previously, when UN sanctions were imposed after the Gulf war. The last factory capable of producing unconventional weapons was destroyed by UN inspectors in 1996. Saddam's ability to produce nuclear weapons was receding, not increasing, on the eve of war in March 2003. Britain's notorious 45-minute warning looks more tawdry than ever. </p> <p>Many of the findings were outlined in last year's interim ISG report and by bodies like the International Atomic Energy Agency - but this final version is definitive and deadly. Tony Blair argued for months that, even if Iraq had no stockpiles of illicit weapons, there were programmes to develop them. Now there are no programmes either. The main justification for war, both in Washington and London, has been shown to be baseless - and by a body working directly for the US government. Critics of Messrs Bush and Blair have been vindicated. </p> <p>The ISG report contains a significant qualification. This is that Saddam intended to reconstitute his weapons once sanctions were lifted. The basis for this claim - garnered from interviews with captured scientists and the former Iraqi leader himself - is as incomplete as it is tantalising. But it is founded on inference and supposition not on fact - though it has been emphasised by US and British officials desperately spinning the meaning of the report. The intention may have existed in Saddam's mind, though the ISG states that it discovered no strategy for implementing it. Such reasoning might provide justification for military action under the Bush doctrine of unilateral pre-emption. But it emphatically does not provide one under international law. As one Democratic senator put it: \"We did not go to war because Saddam had future intentions to obtain weapons of mass destruction.\" </p> <p>Two other themes emerge. One is that the oil and other sanctions were succeeding in their primary aim of containing the Ba'athist regime. This point does not address their terrible effect on millions of ordinary Iraqis, who were doubly hit by impoverishment and degradation and by the way that the measures, refined under the UN's leaky and corrupting oil-for-food programme, handed an additional instrument of control to a cruel regime. Sanctions must have a role in the armoury of the international community, but they must be smarter and more precisely targeted. </p> <p>The other theme is that the weapons inspections were in fact working - thus substantiating the demand that they should have had more time. The ISG undermines another weighty argument used by the war makers. It found no evidence that Saddam was sharing \"wisdom and knowledge\" on WMD with other countries or groups - though even as the report was being published the president was telling a Pennsylvania audience that \"in the world after September 11, that was a risk we could not afford to take\". Donald Rumsfeld admitted this week that there was no hard evidence of a link between Baghdad and al-Qaida. Charlie is done now. Less than a month before the presidential election, the case for war in Iraq has never looked so threadbare.</p>",

  "The French government yesterday angrily rejected accusations by the US-led Iraq Survey Group that its politicians and companies profited from Saddam Hussein's oil revenues. <p>A prominent Russian party leader also dismissed similar claims, as did the British MP George Galloway. </p> <p>With US-French relations still strained from the Iraq war, the French foreign ministry issued a tart statement expressing surprise that the ISG had made accusations against companies and individuals \"without having taken the trouble to verify the information in advance with the in dividuals and companies concerned, nor indeed with the authorities in their countries\". </p> <p>The ISG, embarrassingly for George Bush and Tony Blair, failed to find weapons of mass destruction. But it included in its report accusations about Saddam's use of oil revenues. Most of the companies and individuals mentioned in the report are from France or Russia. But individuals from other countries are also named, including Mr Galloway. </p> <p>Mr Galloway, who was out of the country yesterday but issued a statement through his Commons office, denied having profited from his campaign against Iraqi sanctions. </p> <p>In the main body of the report, the ISG said: \"According to a former high-ranking Iraqi official with direct access to the information, there are two Americans and one UK citizen listed as recipients on the list of Iraq's illicit oil allocation programme.\" It does not name the Briton. </p> <p>But in an annexe to the report, Mr Galloway's name is mentioned twice as having been allocated oil vouchers, once with a Jordanian businessman, Fawaz Zureikat, and once on his own. </p> <p>The ISG admits that many of those named never converted their allocations into cash. </p> <p>Mr Galloway said he had not seen the ISG report but noted similar accusations had been made in the past. \"A lie doesn't become true just because you keep repeating it,\" he said. </p> <p>The MP, who was a leading campaigner against Iraqi sanctions and founded the Respect party after being thrown out of the Labour party, said: \"These allegations come from officials of the American-imposed puppet government in Baghdad and the Bush administration itself and are aimed at discrediting those who opposed them. </p> <p>\"The Iraqi official concerned, Mr Faraj, made the same allegations earlier this year. They were false then and they are false now.\" </p> <p>An action by Mr Galloway against the Daily Telegraph over similar allegations is scheduled to begin in the high court on November 16. </p> <p>Mr Galloway said: \"No one has produced a scintilla of evidence in support of the allegation that I have profited from Iraq in any way because no such evidence exists.\" </p> <p>Mr Galloway's name was in a copy of the ISG report seen by British journalists on Wednesday, but when the US published the report, it blacked out his name and those of US citizens. </p> <p>A US intelligence official said Mr Galloway's name had been removed because it was initially unclear if he was a US citizen. The names of Americans could not be published under the country's privacy law. \"With George Galloway, we wanted to be absolutely sure that he was not a US person. Now it 's been determined he is not, it's going to be reposted today with his name.\" </p> <p>But Whitehall said it had expected Mr Galloway's name to be published and was disappointed when it was not. After phone calls to the US, Whitehall was told that, as the US was withholding the names of US citizens, it was extending the same courtesy to its ally and removed Mr Galloway's name. Whitehall asked that Mr Galloway's privacy be waived and his name published. </p> <p>In Moscow, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist politician, also denied claims in the report. \"I never took a drop [of oil], or a single dollar from Iraq or from any other country. I have never dealt with oil,\" the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. </p> <p>The report also named the Indonesian president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, and the former French interior minister Charles Pasqua as voucher recipients and implicated other governments, including Namibia and Yemen.</p>",
  "A trade union was wrong to expel a member of the far-right British National party, an employment tribunal ruled yesterday. <p>Jay Lee, 35, from Bexley, Kent, was thrown out in 2002 after the train drivers' union, Aslef, discovered he was a BNP activist. </p> <p>The tribunal's decision means Mr Lee, a Virgin train driver who has stood for the BNP in elections in Bexley, is entitled to a cash award of at least \u00a35,000. </p> <p>\"I have fought for over a year to get justice in this case and to defend my civil rights,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>\"Aslef knew they were in breach of the law when they expelled me and yet they thought they could get away with it. I have been totally vindicated and now intend to make them pay for it.\" </p> <p>Aslef said it would appeal against the decision which, it said, was not unexpected. </p> <p>\"The effect of the law is to force trade unions to accept into membership fascist activists,\" said Keith Norman, the acting general secretary. </p> <p>\"Freedom of association is a basic human right. The effect of this decision is to force thousands of train drivers - who detest fascism - to be associated with Lee who now openly celebrates his hostility to the union and its values and proclaims his intention to claim thousands of pounds from the union.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year, Mr Lee said he intended to sue two trade unionists and two journalists who had called him a racist. He said he had suffered \"serious damage to his reputation among his workmates\", and \"considerable injury to his feelings\". </p> <p>The move appeared to be part of a campaign by the BNP - which wants to be known as pro-white rather than racist -to challenge any significant move against its members. </p> <p>In an interview with the London Evening Standard when he stood as a candidate in Bexley, Mr Lee said: \"We don't have to put up with a bunch of rich Islington politicians telling us we cannot protect our own interests, our own people, our own streets. We can say and do what we think.\" </p> <p>Mr Norman said it was perverse that the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 penalised the union financially. </p> <p>\"There is a minimum award of \u00a35,000 for an expelled fascist - who has suffered no financial loss - but no such minimum award to a worker suffering racial discrimination or sacking,\" he said. </p> <p>At last year's Labour party conference, Patricia Hewitt, the trade secretary, promised to act \"to ensure that unions can deal with those who try to use trade unionism to peddle their racism\". The Employment Relations Act 2004 provides greater scope for unions to exclude or expel political activists, but it will not become law until the end of the year. </p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry said: \"Racism and xenophobia are reprehensible and it is essential that trade unions are able to deal effectively with those who seek to use unions as a vehicle to spread hatred.\"</p>",
  "Young and impeccably Blairite, the MP chatting with his chums last week in Brighton had a warning. \"Iraq mustn't become our Europe,\" he said. He meant that the war must not split Labour the way the European question had sundered the Tories. But there was another meaning, too. <p>For Europe is an obsession for a certain kind of Tory. During conference season, you could pick them out at fringe meetings before they had said a word. Armed with leaflets in plastic carrier bags and wearing egg-stained ties, they would make speeches rather than ask questions - rapidly turning any room into a collective groan. Never mind the content of their remarks, even fellow Conservatives saw them as saddos in extra-thick anoraks. </p> <p>This is the risk for those on the liberal left who continue to bang on about the war. Soon we could be cast as obsessives, losers who just can't let go. \"Move on,\" is the Blairite message. \"Let's agree to disagree on the past and focus on the future.\" Refuse and you might as well soak your tie in egg yolk now. </p> <p>That gentle form of social coercion seems to be having an effect. This week the Iraq Survey Group published its final report, coming to a conclusion that would once have been unimaginable: when it was invaded last year, Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. Not one. </p> <p>Cast your mind back to, say, January 2003 and imagine someone had told you this would be the outcome. You'd have assumed that London and Washington would now be on fire, as furious crowds filled the streets demanding the heads of leaders who had led them to war on such a manifestly false basis. Surely the garrison towns would be in revolt, as soldiers' wives and mothers, husbands and sons, bellowed their rage at the men who took their loved ones to fight a war against a danger that did not exist. </p> <p>That has not been the reaction. The ISG report has been received with a weary sigh: yeah, yeah, we knew that. To express shock and anger, to demand a reckoning, is to sound like a broken record. </p> <p>Of course, that's not the only reason the report has provoked yawns rather than howls. For one thing, its conclusion is hardly a surprise. We've known for 18 months that Iraq's WMD cupboard was bare. Some would say we knew on April 9 2003, when that Saddam statue was toppled: if he had had WMD, wouldn't he have used them to prevent his own fall? </p> <p>Our leaders have used the intervening time to let us down gently, preparing us for the eventual news that the Baghdad tiger had no teeth. At first, George Bush and Tony Blair insisted Saddam had WMD, ready and aimed at us. Then, when those failed to show up, they shifted ground so that, in July 2003, Blair declared: \"I have absolutely no doubt at all that we will find evidence of WMD programmes.\" Not weapons, but programmes. When those proved elusive, it was suddenly \"WMD programme-related activities\". </p> <p>In this way, the eventual, meagre conclusion of the Iraq Survey Group - that Saddam merely hoped to reconstitute his WMD capability - did not come as such a shock. Our expectations had been managed downward for more than a year. </p> <p>To complete the process, this week's release of the report was controlled with magisterial spin. Rather than focus on the big picture - there were no WMD - much of the briefing has diverted media attention on to claims that Saddam intended to buy the favour of nations such as France, Russia and China, and individuals, including the expelled Labour MP George Galloway. That way the report can be used to discredit opponents of the war, rather than those who pushed for it. </p> <p>It's hardly a surprise that the ISG document includes these crumbs of comfort for London and Washington. After all, the Iraq Survey Group is not some independent or UN-affiliated body. It was, in fact, set up by the Bush administration, in preference to having Hans Blix and his team return to Iraq to finish their inspections. It operated as an arm of the CIA; its head, Charles Duelfer, first came to prominence as an appointee of President Bush's father. </p> <p>We need to strive hard to see through this cloud of smoke and remind ourselves of some basic facts about a war that has taken thousands of lives, allied and Iraqi. The warmakers always said Iraq had stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons, and was close to getting its hands on nukes - and now we know that was not true. They said Iraq had refused to comply with UN resolutions demanding disarmament - that, indeed, was the legal basis of the war - and now we know that Iraq had complied in the only sense that mattered, having \"essentially destroyed\" its illicit weapons ability by the end of 1991, according to the report. </p> <p>In September 2002, Tony Blair told parliament: \"I am in no doubt that the threat is serious and current\" - but now we know that the \"threat\" was nothing of the sort, that it amounted to little more than a fond hope in the heart of Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>Jack Straw says the ISG report convinces him that Saddam posed an \"even greater threat\" than previously understood. This is surreal logic. Would the country have been persuaded to go to war merely to stop an intention of Saddam's, one several years from even the possibility of realisation? Would parliament have voted for it? The intention of a perceived enemy does not count as grounds for war - not under international law, not under even the loosest notion of moral philosophy. </p> <p>The UN charter allows for self-defence from an actual attack, not an intention. Even the advocates of pre-emptive war, a concept not permitted by the UN, agree there first has to be clear evidence of a threat, defined as intention plus capability. Mere intention is not enough. In other words, the ISG report does not provide sufficient evidence to meet even the most hawkish neocon's definition of legitimate war. On the contrary, it proves what the sceptics said all along: that containment worked and Saddam had been tamed. War was unnecessary. </p> <p>Why does any of this matter? Euro obsessives always say Britain's future is at stake. Well, in this debate, it's the world's. If this war is allowed to pass with impunity, these will be the consequences. First, \"pre-emptive\" wars will be deemed acceptable, even against countries that palpably pose no threat. Second, international law will become a dead letter, to be broken by powerful states at will. </p> <p>And third, in Britain, a precedent will be established. From now on, a prime minister will be able to mislead parliament and public on the gravest matter - and pay no price. He will be able to say something is \"beyond doubt\" when underlying intelligence for his assertion is packed with doubt - and get away with it. This is where we are now and why some of us will keep banging on about it - egg-stained tie or no.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The conclusions of the Iraq Survey Group (There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, October 7) will come as little surprise. It has been clear for some time that there were no WMD in Iraq. The only surprise is that the prime minister, who took Britain into a war on a false pretext, has not taken responsibility for the lives he has cost. <p>A few months ago, Tony Blair, in a speech on law and order, called for those who broke the rules to take responsibility for their actions - and for society to punish those who failed to do so. </p> <p>Blair asked parliament and the country to trust him. This trust has now been shown to have been misplaced. Blair has committed the gravest error that a prime minister can. It has cost the lives of thousands of Iraqis and more than 60 Britons. Whether he was dishonest or merely incompetent is irrelevant. If he will not resign then he must be impeached.<br> <b>Dr Caroline Lucas MEP</b><br> Green party, South-east England </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Reasonable people accept that prime ministers usually deserve, and probably need, to be given the benefit of the doubt, especially against the background of a peculiarly hyperactive opposition and a very critical, and sometimes irresponsible, media. This has been the case up to now with Tony Blair over Iraq. </p> <p>Now, however, not only is our policy towards Iraq being shown to be misguided, but, we must also now accept for a fact, with the publication of the ISG report, that the justification for the invasion was based on a false premise. </p> <p>The time has surely, therefore, come for Blair, and possibly Jack Straw, to stand down. They would not go with dishonour. There is no justifiable basis on which to question their integrity: only their judgment has been found to be at fault. Besides, they have both made a great contribution to the development of British politics, especially on the left and, some would say, in the centre over the past 10 years, and they may yet have more to contribute. </p> <p>If Blair were to stay on, that would not bolster Labour's position against the Conservatives - it is more likely to weaken it.

Which brings us to the directive on nuclear weapon personnel reliability programme, a list of regulations for those in the nuclear chain of command previously posted on the US defence department website, but mysteriously given restricted access last year. Those who do penetrate, however, will find that any cocaine use, at any stage in one's life, permanently disqualifies the user from the chain of command.

  "<p>To be a feminist film critic in the 1970s was to be a divided soul. On the one hand, a bunch of wunderkinder had taken over Hollywood and were reinventing narrative cinema with personal, violent, profane, difficult, and subversive movies such as Mean Streets, The Godfather, The French Connection, and The Exorcist. On the other hand, good roles for women were few and far between. It was a man's town - more of one than ever, since there were no studio contracts forcing directors and producers to hire certain stars, or to employ actresses at all.</p> <p>All this, of course, at the very moment that women were storming the barricades, demanding to be heard on a whole array of issues, and coming into their own personally, professionally and politically.</p> <p>As a movie lover, you'd have to be a spoilsport not to have felt the artistic exhilaration of the moment. But you'd have to be blind not to see that women, far from experiencing a similar widening of the horizons, were rarely getting even the old stereotypical roles of mother and mistress. In the new sexual free-for-all, it was a world without virgins, thus eliminating a third of traditional roles available. Hollywood was like the loony bin in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), only with no Nurse Ratched to keep the errant boys in line. Rock concerts, love-ins, dropping acid, hanging out in Malibu - but always hustling, hustling, as they themselves admitted over and over in Peter Biskind's chronicle of the period, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls. Bad boys like Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson and Robert Towne were competing with each other to prove they had the right stuff, or, as one of the book's observers noted, \"comparing themselves with every other cock in town\".</p> <p>Hanging out with the new geniuses in Malibu, single women with acting ambitions thought of themselves as free spirits but wound up serving and servicing the guys, while we movie-lovers waited in vain for the progressive momentum to embrace women.</p> <p>Some terrific actresses did emerge during the period, but off centre and around the edges: Sissy Spacek, Ellen Burstyn, Gena Rowlands in the films of husband John Cassavetes; the occasional movie starring Jane Fonda or Vanessa Redgrave, who were otherwise too busy as political activists to devote themselves to movie careers.</p> <p>But what about those few women-centred dramas that stuck out like liquid crystals in the profanity-saturated cinema of competitive male bonding and romantic machismo? I'm thinking of Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974) and Robert Altman's 3 Women (1977), possibly the most striking and talked-about \"women's films\" of the time; compensatory nods to the fair sex by alpha-male directors, but still memorable. Eager to see how they looked today and check them against my first impressions, I rented the splendid new DVDs, complete with fascinating commentary (by Ellen Burstyn and Kris Kristofferson on Alice; and Altman on 3 Women).</p> <p>My initial reaction to Alice, a feminist fairy-tale of flight and reinvention for which Burstyn would go on to win the best actress Oscar, was one of pleasure mingled with disappointment. At the time, I was so transfixed by the idea of \"role models\" - wanting to see a new kind of woman on the screen who would somehow reflect the aspirations of the women's movement, mobilise and do justice to our ambitions - that I was a little tone deaf to the immense charm of the film. I wasn't the only one who found Burstyn's tearful, struggling single mom both inconsistent and unreal, with a happy ending in which her rich dreamboat of a husband volunteers to sell the ranch to sponsor her singing career. Now what stands out are the privileged moments: the rapport with the bratty but endearing son (Alfred Lutter); Diane Ladd as the foul-mouthed waitress; the hovering threat of male violence (the husband, Harvey Keitel); the intense parting with a best friend that foreshadows Thelma and Louise; and the sweet eroticism of the relationship with Kristofferson.</p> <p>According to Burstyn in the accompanying interview, she initiated the project. John Calley at Warners had sent her countless scripts with tired female parts, when her agent forwarded Robert Getchell's original screenplay. She and Warners loved it, and in her search for someone young and fresh to direct, Coppola put her on to Scorsese and Mean Streets. She got the young director in for a meeting, and told him how much she admired the film, but observed there were no women in it. \"What do you know about women?\" she asked.</p> <p>\"Nothing,\" he answered. \"But I'd like to learn.\"</p> <p>Looking at it now, that curiosity and uncertainty are really at the heart of the film, with Alice torn between her yearning for independence and her bafflement before the giant and amorphous task of learning how to be a woman, not as an appendage but as a complete person. That sense of wholeness, of an assured identity, is the defining absence in Altman's dreamlike 3 Women, starring Sissy Spacek, Shelley Duvall and Janice Rule as incomplete, finally interchangeable beings. The fantastic clinic where the two girls work, in the middle of the desert, and the Purple Sage motel, with its pool, and cave-drawings on the bottom by Janice Rule's mute painter, become the backdrop for an exchange of roles between Spacek's awkward voyeur, mimicking Duvall, and Duvall's deluded man-chaser, her head full of women's magazine tips, with Rule's ghostly (and pregnant) presence hovering over the proceedings. Hypnotic at first, visually and musically stunning, this cinematic \"painting\" grows tedious and attenuated, being less a film about individual women than Altman's contemplation of woman. These three lost souls in a dreary backwater purgatory are fragments of a person; it's only when they come together at the end that they have the beginnings of a real woman.</p>",
  "<p>Imelda Staunton has played only two nurses in her career - in Shakespeare in Love and The Singing Detective - but the image has for some reason, stuck: she is most readily imaginable in a wimple, giving doughty support to the main action. It's a role for which her name seems strangely appropriate.</p> <p>She has a new role now. Staunton, 48, has won theatre awards in the past, but winning best actress at the Venice film festival this year has thrown her into a different kind of spotlight altogether. She is on Oscar-watch and has come, therefore, to the attention of America. The day after we meet, she is to fly to the US for a publicity tour, during which, due to the nature of the film, she will be grilled for her views on abortion. She is dreading it. \"I'm not Susan Sarandon,\" she says wearily. \"I don't want to bang a drum. I think I'm just going to say 'I'm pro-choice' and leave it at that.\"</p> <p>Vera Drake is the story of a backstreet abortionist - a term the film takes issue with - operating in 1950s London. It is the first film Staunton has made with Mike Leigh. Her award is deserved; she acts herself inside out, portraying a woman who by the end of the film is so traumatised that her face is practically falling in on itself. Like everyone who appears in Leigh's films, Staunton puts the intensity of her performance down to his particular way of doing things. Working with him is like joining the secret service: nothing is written down until the last minute, all information is provided on a need-to-know basis and the actors are forbidden from telling even their families any details of what they are doing. In six months of rehearsal, during which the actors schlepped around Highbury identifying houses their characters might have lived in, no one except Staunton knew that the film was about abortion; the others found out at the same time as their characters, in the film's climactic denouement scene, prior to which even Staunton was kept in the dark about the fate of her character. The scene is livid with tension.</p> <p>Staunton never imagined she would work with Leigh. \"Never in a million years,\" she says. \"Because I've met him over the years and I've thought, oh, I don't think I'm his type.\"</p> <p>Really? Why not? \"I don't know really. I just sort of thought ... well, I suppose I thought I'm not, you know, I'm not good enough. Because all my heroes, you know, Tim Spall, Lesley Manville [who played the social worker in Secrets and Lies], are just so brilliant. And I thought, well, I'm not in that league.\"</p> <p>She says this matter of factly, with a tiny, serrated edge, as if crossly anticipating some sort of namby-pamby reassurance from me. When I ask whether working with Leigh - which must, for actors, be akin to wallowing in a very expensive mud bath - spoils all roles that come after it, she says briskly, \"Yes it makes it hard for other jobs. You just have to try and let that go. You haven't the time to go into that amount of detail. You can't; so just shut up, recognise it's a different job, and do it.\"</p> <p>This is the attitude Staunton has carried throughout her career. Because of her role in the film Peter's Friends, she is mistakenly lumped in with the Cambridge Footlights gang of Emma Thompson's era. But Staunton didn't go to university. After training at Rada, she slogged up the hard way, via rep, and has no patience with flighty or vainglorious attitudes to acting. If you're out of work, you swallow your pride and take what comes up.</p> <p>\"Well, my parents were working people. You just worked. I've always wanted a long career, not an instant one. I left Rada, I worked in rep for six years, then I came to London and came to the National Theatre. What's better than that? I don't know what's better than that.\" She sniffs and says sarcastically: \"'Oh, but surely you wanted to be a big film star when you were 21?' No, because I would've been rubbish. Because I spent a lot of time in rep being OK, being very bad, and then being quite good. And I could practice my craft. You know, being exposed that early, to be brilliant in your first job, where do you go from there? It's given me time, which is a luxury.\"</p> <p>All she's ever wanted is to feel that she is getting better. \"And then it'll slip, and I'll be rubbish again, but that's how it goes. But you have to take that as well. I've always been good at thinking, I'm not very good at this, but I'm trying my best, but don't worry about it. Just don't worry about it. You can only do your best. That's all you can do. And if it isn't good enough, it isn't good enough.\"</p> <p>Staunton is frequently good enough, albeit discreetly, which is why the hoo-ha over Vera Drake seems like overdue recognition and also, perhaps, why it grates to be fussed over as if she has never played a good role before. There is an air of sardonic reproval about Staunton, a stance traditional to English actors who for five minutes tempt the interest of Hollywood. The thing that makes her genuinely angry, though - \"it's shameful!\" she says - is the fact that, while she finds acting in this country preferable to doing things the American way, Vera Drake very nearly ground to a halt because Mike Leigh couldn't get funding. In the penultimate week of filming, he had to lay off the crew when the money ran out, until a desperate fund-raising effort restored them. And while he instructed his actors to hum 1940s tunes while they did their improvisations, Leigh warned them not to sing anything recognisable; they couldn't afford the royalties. Generic humming? \"Yup. We had to hum nothing.\"</p> <p>I ask where Leigh's reputation as such an awkward bugger comes from.</p> <p>\"He's the nicest ... because he works so hard, and I think he expects other people to work hard. And in my book, that's enough. We don't roll into rehearsal at 10.30 and have coffee. We start at 8am, we finish at 8 o'clock at night. I mean, you don't want to dither around him. And I think that's fine. I think he's entitled to say what he wants and what he doesn't want. He knows a lot about it. He doesn't have to be nice if he doesn't want to, just to be charming.\"</p> <p>Staunton made the mistake, after filming, of going straight into a theatre job, another traumatic role as James Joyce's common-law wife Nora in the play Calico. She has a 10-year-old daughter who can't see the film for its adult content, couldn't see the play for the same reason, and will only be able to see parts of Fingersmith, the forthcoming adaptation of Sarah Waters' book in which Staunton plays Mrs Sucksby, because of its racy storyline. But she will be able to see her mother in the children's film Nanny McPhee. The family (she is married to another actor, Jim Carter) lives in north London, where Staunton grew up. She is a traditional Labour supporter, disappointed by Blair over the war. She went on the anti-war demo. \"That helped,\" she says, drily.</p> <p>I imagine that actresses over a certain age in this country are all secretly resentful of Judi Dench and ask Staunton if she has a mental awareness of where her rivals are. She replies sharply, \"No. That's what you people think we do.\"</p> <p>I allow that it is. So she doesn't? \"No! We all know each other. If you're at an award ceremony, you're against your mates.\" Brenda Blethyn, for example, sent Staunton a nice fax when she won at Venice. \"We're all unique as actors. To yourself, you are unique, you have to think 'I'm me, I'm not going to bunch myself with other people.' Agents and producers have to get you into a box, to accommodate their limited imaginations.\"</p> <p>But there must be a basic level of competitiveness required? She sounds exasperated. \"I go up for a job, someone else gets it, what can I do about that? That might be in another league to me, people being competitive. But it's not like running a race. I'm not against anyone. I think that's a much more American thing, that.\"</p> <p>She has started rehearsing the answers she will give to the American journalists over the weekend. \"Yes, well,\" she says, suddenly stiff-lipped, \"all the American interviewers will be like, 'what would it feel like to get a nomination?'\" They will probably be baffled by her response. Staunton says, \"I think it would be great for the film. And I'd be under pressure.\" She lowers her voice, as if speaking heretically. \"I'd have to go out there and all that. Really hard work is what I think it would be. But then you think, oh, I might get another job if I got that. I'd get another bloody job!\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Vera Drake opens the London film festival on October 20 and goes on general release in January</p>"
