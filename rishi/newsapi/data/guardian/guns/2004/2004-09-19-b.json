  "<p>Cliveden, along with several other esteemed country house hotels, hit the headlines last week after being axed from the 2005 Good Hotel Guide. The hotel had lost its 'sparkle' according to the guide, which also claims to have received a number of complaints ranging from 'a young porter with acne' showing a guest to their room to a '30-minute wait' upon check-in. </p> <p>Yet a Cliveden spokesperson claims that bookings have not been affected by the bad publicity and the hotel has been inundated with letters of support from previous guests. </p> <p>Famous for its association with the Profumo scandal (it was in the outdoor swimming pool that John Profumo met Christine Keeler), Cliveden received a further boost after Conde Nast Traveller 's readers rated the hotel as one of the UK's top 10 luxury leisure hotels. </p> <p>So who to believe? Cliveden had long been on my list of places to visit and last weekend I did just that. I'd envisaged following in the footsteps of former owners the Astor family and practically every British monarch since George I. I was all set to play billiards in Lord Mountbatten's billiard room, read in the library accompanied by the ghost of George Bernard Shaw, take tea (or perhaps something a little stronger) in the Great Hall where Charlie Chaplin and Winston Churchill once did the same. I was not disappointed. We too had to wait to check in, but waiting with afternoon tea in the Great Hall - complete with an ornate Italian 16th-century fireplace and artwork worth millions of pounds on the walls - is hardly a chore. Cliveden is quirky, unique and possibly one of the most impressive places I have ever stayed. Could it be that the multi-billionaire who complained about the spotty porter was having a bad day? Having seen it for myself, I'm inclined to give Cliveden the benefit of the doubt.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Letter of the week</strong><br></p> <p><strong>See family in Pakistan</strong></p> <p><strong> My son, his wife and children live in Islamabad. I really would like to see my grandchildren, so am planning to visit. I've been told that the best time is November to March. I'll be travelling on my own and would like to stay in a hotel.</strong><br> Margaret McLintock, Arbroath </p> <p>It's straightforward to arrange a trip to Islamabad - both PIA and British Airways fly direct from London several times a week, or you can connect via the Gulf. Fares start at around \u00a3500 including taxes - try Ebookers (0870 814 4001; <a href=\"http://www.ebookers.com\">ebookers.com</a> for reservations. The weather is cool and dry from November to February or March, but you might find nights feeling chilly - take some warm clothes just in case. </p> <p>Islamabad is a planned city built during the 1960s which, though it lacks major tourist attractions, is an interesting place to spend a few days. As well as being home to one of Asia's largest mosques and several good museums, the Margalla Hills National Park makes a pleasant day-trip from the city. </p> <p>The neighbouring city of Rawalpindi has the colourful Rajah Bazaar, which is a great place to wander. </p> <p>Islamabad has everything from budget hostels to luxury international-class hotels. Mid-range rooms with en-suite and TV will start at around \u00a315. If your son cannot suggest anywhere, Lonely Planet's new Pakistan &amp; the Karakoram Highway guide has lots of recommendations. A taxi from the airport to your hotel will cost only \u00a32-\u00a33. </p> <p><strong>Peru with a baby</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> My Peruvian wife and I, would like to take our newborn daughter to visit family in Cuzco. We are worried about the altitude and what affect this might have on one so young.</strong><br> Don McCaffrey, by email </p> <p>A baby will experience everything you will when flying straight from sea level to an elevation of 3,326m (10,910ft), including breathlessness, increased heart-rate and dizziness. This will be a confusing and disorienting experience for a traveller so young, as well as being unpleasant for you as parents. If you have to make this journey, fly into Lima (which is at sea level) and take at least a week, preferably longer, to ascend very slowly to Cuzco. You and your baby will benefit from the extra time to get used to the height. If she shows any signs of suffering from the altitude, consider descending immediately. If these preparations mean time runs short, you can always fly back from Cuzco to Lima. </p> <p>Alternatively, wait until your daughter is slightly older before making the trip; or see if you can get your family to meet you in Lima or elsewhere on the coast. </p> <p>It's essential you talk over your plans in greater detail with experts - the helpful Nomad Travel Store Travel Health Info Line (09068 633414) is a good place to start. </p> <p><strong>Niagara by rail</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> A buddy and I are hoping for a week in Toronto next summer (July/August) and would like to go via New York. Is it possible to take a train from Manhattan through New York state with a visit to Niagara Falls along the way? Advice and guidance would be much appreciated.</strong><br> Nicholas Baldwin, Bristol </p> <p>Amtrak's Maple Leaf service, which covers this route, is one of North America's classic train journeys. The trip from New York to Toronto takes around 12 hours and is a beautiful one, going up to Canada via the Hudson River Valley, the state capital of Albany, the Finger Lake gorges and the mighty Niagara Falls. OK, so trains leave from New York's functional Penn Station rather than the breathtaking Grand Central, but you'll still experience the excitement of arriving or leaving the Big Apple by shiny Amtrak train. </p> <p>Trains leave New York at 7.15am daily, arriving at Niagara Falls at 3.40pm on the American side of the water. Fares depend on when you travel and book, but you'll need to get a ticket from New York to the Falls, then another on to Toronto. </p> <p>For full details see the Amtrak website (<a href=\"http://www.amtrak.com\">amtrak.com</a>). Book tickets and accommodation well in advance. July and August are peak travel periods and Niagara Falls will be very busy. </p> <p><strong>Get organised in Libya</strong><br></p> <p><strong> For my 50th birthday in October I would like to go to Libya with my husband, travelling independently and hiring a car. We would like to visit Roman sites and maybe spend some time near the sea. We have about seven to 10 days. Would it be practical to fly to Egypt/Tunisia and would that be less expensive than flying to Libya?</strong><br> Rowan Collier, by email </p> <p>Independent travel is, at the time of writing, still impossible in Libya. You must have a visa to travel and visas are granted only to tourists on an organised tour. This leaves two options - go with a UK company or use a Libyan travel agency. </p> <p>Steppes East (01285 651010; <a href=\"http://www.steppeseast.co.uk\">steppeseast.co.uk</a>) can organise tailor-made itineraries - a seven-day trip starts at around \u00a32,900. Local tours will work out cheaper but generally require four people to make up a group. Readers recommend using Arkno Tours (<a href=\"http://www.arkno.com\">arkno.com)</a> - its UK representative is Caravanserai Tours (020 8855 6373). </p> <p>It can be a headache to organise travel via Tunisia or Egypt and you should check in advance if you can begin your tour at the border. Car hire can be prohibitively expensive and you'll generally need to be accompanied by your tour guide, so if you do get free time to explore it works out better value to hire a taxi. </p> <p>Despite all the regulations, Libya is a tremendously rewarding country to visit. The ancient remains of Leptis Magna, Sabratha and Cyrene, mixed with spectacular Sahara scenery and miles of beaches, give the country huge tourism potential. Going now, despite all the restrictions, ensures you'll beat the crowds. </p> <p> <strong>Over to you ... readers' feedback</strong></p> <p><strong> I was horrified by Kelly Taylor's plan to emigrate to Australia overland via the Trans-Siberian railway with an 18-month-old in tow.</strong> (5 September)<br> She acknowledges such a trip would be 'hard work': some understatement. It would be torture for a toddler to be confined for so long in such a space - and having walked up and down an aircraft aisle about 100 times on a two-hour flight with my son when he was 18 months, I could imagine her getting off the train in Beijing feeling like she'd walked all the way from Moscow!

  "As the Observer reveals today, thousands of very ill patients in Britain are helped to die each year by their doctors. Sometimes the fatal doses of morphine are administered with their knowledge, sometimes only with the knowledge of their families who don't want to see them suffer further. It is all done on the quiet because such an action can lead to the doctor being on a murder charge. Politicians naturally shy away from entering this emotive arena. The very term 'mercy killing' conjures up images of doctors administering lethal injections to comatose patients. There is also the very real concern that any legislation would put elderly people under pressure to agree to an assisted death to help their relatives. <p>But the law currently proposed by Lord Joffe, and being debated in the House of Lords, sets out a framework which would comprehensively outlaw such cases. His proposal is that only patients who are terminally ill and judged to have less than six months to live would be eligible for an assisted death. They would have to be in 'unbearable pain', be capable of making a rational decision about their future and would have to undergo both a medical and psychological examination. There would also be a 'cooling-off' period so that they could contemplate the process they had been through. </p> <p>Polls show that both the public and the medical profession support reform of the law on assisted death. It is a basic desire to want our end to be as peaceful, dignified and pain-free as possible. The thousands of people with terminal illnesses have little hope of this at the moment. They need ministers to have the courage to look for a path which will cut through the ethical and legal complexities. If it is possible on abortion and cloning, it must also be possible to frame legislation that allows the dying the right to a dignified departure.</p>",
  "<p>At a key moment in my conversation with Robin Duval, the retiring director of the British Board of Film Classification, he uses a phrase which I never thought I would hear from a censor: 'It's only a movie.' Duval is remembering an on-air confrontation with BBC presenter John Humphrys regarding the board's decision to pass the controversial rape-revenge movie Irreversible without cuts. </p> <p>'Irreversible may have been shocking,' explains Duval, 'and it may even have been offensive to many people. But our position was that unless we had clear evidence that it was actually harmful, we were not going to interfere. John Humphrys had difficulty accepting that, because he belongs to the constituency which believes that if something looks pretty brutal, then common sense tells you it must have a malign effect on society. </p> <p>'Well, I've spent 15 years reviewing that proposition and the one thing I know is that adults simply aren't affected in a malign manner by material which is merely shocking. Personally, I think that Irreversible was actually highly moral, if a little sentimental. But if common sense tells us anything, it's that it's only a movie.' </p> <p>This phrase is heavy with irony, not only because it has long been a battle-cry for those who oppose the iniquities of film censorship, but also because it was the tagline of another violent rape-revenge movie over which Duval and I had clashed publicly a couple of years ago. </p> <p>In 2002, I had written a staunch defence of Wes Craven's long-banned shocker, Last House on the Left, a grisly retelling of Bergman's The Virgin Spring, in which parents wreak bloody vengeance upon the gang of killers who raped and tortured their daughter. Described by Craven, who went on to direct A Nightmare on Elm Street, as a depiction of the true horror of violence, this deliberately revolting work had been uncertificated for nearly 30 years when Duval finally agreed to pass it on video with minor cuts. The distributors, however, were holding out for an intact release and took their case to the Video Appeals Committee, where my written defence was duly submitted as 'expert evidence'. </p> <p>The appeal failed badly (the VAC actually concluded that more cuts were needed), and the board received 'the first clear endorsement of our guidelines on sexual violence by a quasi-judicial review'. So was the Last House case, which received relatively little press coverage, a defining moment in Duval's leadership? </p> <p>'Let us say that there was a principle which was protected by that decision which might be more important in other circumstances,' he says, choosing his words carefully. And would he have resigned if the decision had gone the other way, if the VAC had bought my high-falutin' argument about Last House being 'an important historical artefact' rather than a piece of trash? </p> <p>'At the time, to tell you the truth, that option was in my mind. I did mention to one or two people that if we lose this, and we lose it on the grounds that our sexual violence policy was non-viable, that I would have to go.' </p> <p>There is a brief silence as I consider the prospect of having unintentionally plotted to bring about Duval's resignation. In hindsight, this would have been a bad thing. For despite the Last House debacle, in his five-and-a-half year tenure at the BBFC, Duval has probably done more to make the board open, accountable and credible than any previous chief censor. Describing 'the introduction of transparency' as a key objective, he is 'proud to have espoused the principle that you don't impose your views on 18-rated movies - movies for adults - unless you have the soundest possible reason for doing so'. Accordingly, under his watch a bewildering array of formerly banned titles, from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to The Story of O, have been granted uncut cinema certificates, while classics like Sam Peckinpah's savage West Country western Straw Dogs have finally been allowed onto the video shelves. </p> <p>Parents are now permitted to make up their own minds about whether their children are ready to watch titles such as Spider-Man or Lord of the Rings: Return of the King thanks to the introduction of the newly advisory 12A category in 2002. Meanwhile, adults can buy legally classified hardcore pornography through licensed sex shops, thanks, in part, to the establishment of 'very clear and specific' guidelines laid down by BBFC to walk a path between the restraints of the Obscene Publications Act and the newly enshrined freedoms of the Human Rights Act. For those who believe in freedom of choice, Duval's leadership of BBFC has provided several rays of sunshine. </p> <p>'When I arrived at the BBFC, it was a very dark place to work,' Duval admits, 'both literally and figuratively. The building was Dickensian, full of dark corridors and people working in conditions to which I hadn't been exposed since working for the Central Office of Information back in the Seventies. There was a real air of gloominess about the place. The staff were demoralised and a little bit paranoid.' Part of the source of this paranoia was a stream of excoriating articles in the Daily Mail, which had taken to 'naming and shaming' examiners responsible for passing 'filth' such as David Cronenberg's Crash. Considering attack to be the best form of defence, Duval decided to 'get the retaliation in first' by transforming the board into a proactive 'centre of excellence for information'. </p> <p>Under his leadership, an extensive public consultation exercise was carried out, resulting in the publication of newly defined and clarified classification guidelines in September 2000. For the first time, the board got a press officer and its website was revamped to make running times and cuts information freely available to the public. Meanwhile, Duval set about untangling the various 'problem cases' which had festered under the reign of his autocratic predecessor, James Ferman, none more notorious than the unofficial banning of The Exorcist on video for more than 15 years. 'I was always on your side about The Exorcist,' laughs Duval, who was aware that I had become the film's most vocal supporter, regularly bemoaning its mistreatment by the BBFC. 'In fact, I had a confrontation with Jim [Ferman] about it as far back as the Eighties when I was working at the Independent Broadcasting Association. Jim had rung me up to tell me that he expected the IBA to forbid any transmission of the film, and I had to tell him that I did not agree with his worries. Then when I came to the BBFC, Jim, who was still around, got wind that we were contemplating passing it uncut on video. So he again gave me his standard lecture on how unwise this would be, how it would traumatise viewers, particularly young women. But we had trawled through the film's history around the world and we knew that the stories of its traumatising effects were exaggerated. So we passed it. At which you, Mark, should be happy.' </p> <p>While I was indeed delighted about such decisions, Alexander Walker, the Evening Standard's fiery film critic, regularly charged Duval and his colleagues with dereliction of duty for failing to protect the public from a 'tide of filth'. 'I do miss Alex,' says Duval with a hint of genuine sadness. 'Since his death, our profile in the Evening Standard has virtually disappeared.' </p> <p>Walker's favourite ploy was to pen outraged reviews, claiming that the BBFC had passed material which was clearly in breach of its guidelines, or even of the law itself. Did such claims ever worry Duval? 'Well, I remember that in his review of Gone in 60 Seconds, Walker accused us of passing material which showed audiences in graphic detail how to break into a car. I hadn't actually seen the movie at the time, because the examining team had been clear that there were no problems whatsoever. But when the story came out, I rushed to the local cinema to watch it for myself. I was relieved to find that Alex was wrong and the examiners had been entirely correct.' </p> <p>On the subject of pornography, Duval maintains a world-weary detachment. Having helped to establish a 'pretty specific set of criteria' which redefined the boundaries of consensual screen sex, he now exudes an air of depressed resignation about the mechanics of enacting such standards. </p> <p>'No matter what anybody imagines,' he says, sighing, 'regulating porn is the least attractive and most exhausting task of an examiner at the BBFC. We have had to be vigilant that at no point should any of our examiners start to find themselves overwhelmed by this stuff. Nearly 20 per cent of all submitted porn has to be cut, and the reason is simple: the distributors have been using us as their editors. They save money and time on viewing their films by simply sending them straight to us. You ring up and say, \"You do know there's bestiality in this film?\" And they say, \"No, we didn't. But thanks for telling us!\"' </p> <p>Less shocking, but rather more troublesome, is the issue of the 12A certificate which has presented some unforeseen problems. 'When we researched the idea of an advisory 12 category, 70 per cent of those questioned were in favour. And although we expected a certain amount of people to complain about five-year-olds being able to watch a James Bond film, we were caught off guard by complaints that those five-year-olds are so bored that they run up and down the aisles and disrupt the film for everyone else. Put bluntly, cinema staff are indiscriminately letting babes-in-arms and toddlers in to see 12A rated movies, despite a very clear understanding that it was not expected to accommodate very young children.' </p> <p>So will the certificate be rescinded? 'No, I don't think so. But what might happen is that a formal lower age limit may be imposed, which is what they have in Sweden and Finland. But of course, that does to some extent undermine the whole principal of the 12A, which is asking parents to take on the responsibility to be media literate.' </p> <p>For Duval, such media literacy is the key to the future of the BBFC itself. To his successor, David Cooke, who takes over tomorrow, Duval has this advice: 'Watch out for opportunities, because if you don't, you may find that the things you took for granted are going to slip away. The future has to do with providing information rather than taking preventive measures. I see the BBFC becoming a gold-standard of classification and advice information across all the different channels of communication. And classification is, I think, going to thrive. But what probably is going to go away, in the very long term, is the mandatory element.' As for Duval, he is taking the opportunity to return to the noble profession which he once plied before becoming a regulator. 'I was actually briefly a film critic in a former life. And in a curious way, the latter part of my professional career has been a move away from what I wanted to do. So now I'm going to give myself some time and do some writing.'</p>",
  "From her campaign HQ in Hartlepool, Jody Dunn gazes out every day at three bright orange diamonds attached to the opposite wall. Deliberately designed to ape her own posters for the forthcoming by-election, they accuse the young Liberal Democrat barrister of being 'soft on drugs', 'soft on yobs' and 'soft on crime'. Dunn may be a brown belt in judo, but Labour fights dirty here. <p>The drugs claim stems from the fact that she once represented a heroin addict in court: her party's argument that draconian court orders are not the only answer to troubled teenagers earned the 'yobs' charge. Such tactics may yet ensure that, while Dunn could force the Tories into a humiliating fourth place behind the extremist UK Independence Party, Labour holds on to Peter Mandelson's old seat. </p> <p>For Charles Kennedy, who spent last Friday visiting a Hartlepool school, the vicious tussle here encapsulates the challenge of this week's annual party conference in Bournemouth. While he will kick off with a rally celebrating by-election triumphs in Brent East and Leicester South, Hartlepool shows he cannot build a national campaign around Iraq. Crucially, it also suggests that, in a climate dominated by issues such as crime and terrorism, the old beards-and-sandals stereotype of woolly liberalism could be his Achilles' heel. </p> <p>Mark Oaten, Kennedy's home affairs spokesman and increasingly close confidant, today calls for a new approach of 'tough liberalism' to counter such threats - including plans for a form of 'neighbourhood justice' where petty offenders are judged by their peers. In an article for The Observer, he warns of a 'bidding war between the Tories and Labour to see who can sound tougher on law and order' in the run-up to the election, Oaten concedes that the Lib Dems' willingness to question tough policies 'has left voters with the impression that we are soft on crime.' </p> <p>Kennedy will use this week to suggest he means business on the big issues - and not only traditional Lib Dem concerns. </p> <p>However, that risks upsetting colleagues on the left, increasingly suspicious of the coterie of younger, media-savvy, and discernibly more right-wing frontbenchers around him. The equivalent of the Tories' modernising 'Notting Hill set', they include Oaten as well as Treasury spokesman Vince Cable, who has helped wean the party off its addiction to high taxes; local government spokesman Ed Davey; and Nick Clegg, the brains behind attempts to target the fiftysomething 'Baby Boomer' vote. </p> <p>The two sides clashed publicly last month over the Orange Book, a volume of essays published by Cable's fiercely bright, yet politically naive deputy, David Laws, whose own chapter calling for healthcare to be funded by social insurance triggered uproar. </p> <p>Kennedy was forced to deny that social insurance was now Lib Dem policy: it still got more publicity than the party's actual ideas on health, rattling those who fear a swing to the right as Kennedy targets Tory-held seats. </p> <p>'We appeal to those people who are peel-offable by being a progressive party,' warns Evan Harris, the party's former health spokesman and an influential figure on the left. 'There's no good principled reason, practical reason or psephological reason [to shift to the right]. Our main issue is getting our existing policies across, not introspecting on our own position.' </p> <p>Yet from the other side, Kennedy will be attacked this weekend by Alan Leaman, former director of strategy to his predecessor Paddy Ashdown. Arguing that chasing Labour votes is an 'expensive cul-de-sac', since most of the party's target seats are Tory, Leaman warns in Policy Review magazine that the party risks 'pushing its political message in the wrong direction'. He adds that Kennedy is in danger of becoming a 'one-trick pony' over Iraq. </p> <p>The limitations of Iraq have certainly been exposed in Hartlepool, whose mainly white, working-class voters largely backed the war, freeing Labour to unleash an aggressive domestic-based campaign. </p> <p>Kennedy will unveil policies aimed at what one aide calls 'the stresses of people's ordinary lives', from student debt to the cost of longterm care. </p> <p>The stresses of Kennedy's own life appear to have lessened since spring, when a bout of food poisoning meant he missed the Budget, prompting rumours of shaky nerves. Critics were silenced only by his performance in June's local and European elections: by summer, polls put the party on 26 points, double its rating going into the 2001 election. In a general election, that could spell Lib Dem gains of 25 seats. </p> <p>But to maintain the momentum, with most of his new supporters since 2001 defecting from Labour, Kennedy must now make inroads into Labour territory. The Lib Dems will push into the cities, arguing that a Tory vote is a wasted vote anywhere but in the shires: they are targeting Liverpool Wavertree and Newcastle Central, alongside Labour seats in Manchester, Sheffield, Cardiff, Oxford and Cambridge. </p> <p>Simultaneously, the party will pursue a 'decapitation strategy' targeting senior Tories from David Davis and Oliver Letwin - both potential leadership candidates - to Michael Howard himself. </p> <p>Can Kennedy target Tory and Labour seats simultaneously, without inflaming divisions in his own party? Aides point out that, in 2001, they took both Tony Benn's old seat in Chesterfield and true-blue Guildford. </p> <p>Up in Hartlepool meanwhile, with its majority of 14,000, Jody Dunn remains resolute: 'If we don't win, I want to know that we gave it our best shot.' That may just be Kennedy's motto, too.</p>",
  "The regular sight of people throwing up and swearing at the police on Saturday night has put crime at the top of the political agenda. Between now and the election the Tory and Labour parties will see who can sound tougher on law and order. It's a contest I don't want to win if it means lurching from one draconian measure to another. <p>Liberal Democrats have rejected illiberal measures to tackle crime as ineffective and a threat to civil liberties. Often we are the only party willing to call for safeguards before handing the police dramatic new powers against terrorism or anti-social behaviour. But that has left the voters with the impression we are soft on crime. </p> <p>This week at our party conference I want to take that on. I believe it's possible to have a liberal policy on law and order and still be tough on crime. I've called it tough liberalism. It challenges the way the other parties do things. Their so-called tough measures are often soft options. Sending somebody to jail, issuing a fine, or declaring a no-go area gives short-term comfort, but doesn't force the offender to change . </p> <p>We have to try harder. Anti-social behaviour orders have a role to play, but the government wrongly believes they are a panacea. An Asbo excludes troublemakers instead of finding a solution that turns the troublemaker into a useful member of society. </p> <p>For the past 10 years Labour and the Tories have taken the George Bush approach to crime: there are some bad guys out there, but if we crack down hard enough everyone will be OK. That's wrong. First, it means we're forced to repeat the mistakes of history. Second, people are left to their fears instead of being encouraged to help rebuild communities. </p> <p>That's why the Liberal Democrats are proposing a new kind of community justice. Instead of lazing around in prison or on probation, we would expect non-violent offenders to pay back their debt to society through compulsory work on community projects. The work would be identified by local people and 'commissioned' from the Probation Service, who would provide supervision and monitoring </p> <p>I would like to see a system where volunteers sit on community justice panels and hear cases such as graffiti or vandalism. The accused would be offered a choice - go to court or go before a panel of your neighbours and fellow citizens and account for your behaviour. </p> <p>Let's imagine a hearing involving a young man arrested for uprooting trees in a park. The first thing would be for the panel to accept a verbal apology on behalf of the community. They would then discuss possible reparation with the offender. They might agree that he would spend the next three months working with the council horticultural team at weekends, with a contract stipulating minimum standards of acceptable behaviour. If the work and the contract was successfully completed, the debt would be repaid. If not, he would return to court for formal sentencing. </p> <p>There are two important caveats. If the offender does not consent to the panel's decision, he returns to court. The whole point of the panel is to arrive at a conclusion which is acceptable to all parties, so that the offender can 'earn' his way back into society. </p> <p>Second, the panel would work closely alongside health, education, and other agencies to ensure that underlying problems were addressed. Where appropriate, part of the agreement would be to attend drug or alcohol rehabilitation. </p> <p>I believe these policies, matched with our plans to increase the number of police by 10,000 and to equip them with the kind of technology that can make them more effective on our streets, will make a real difference. It's a tough set of measures, but at their heart they remain liberal solutions.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Mark Oaten is Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman.</p>",
  "<p>KARIN AND OLOF DREIJER are dressed in fencing suits, by a stretch of old railway in Shoreditch, east London.

Not only do they consider themselves artists in the widest sense of the word - they design their album covers , commission budding talent for their award-winning videos and wrote the soundtrack to arthouse film Hannah Med H - but Deep Cuts includes 'The Cop', a 44-second song which starts with the lines 'I am a cop/ Shut up/ I piss in your mouth.'</p> <p>'We are political,' confirms Karin, 29, originally from Gothenburg but resident in Stockholm. Olof, 23, agrees. 'We are interested in gender and feminism but we wanted to package the music in a way that the political issues would get to people. We were really influenced by Fahrenheit 9/11 because of the way Michael Moore packaged his message.' Accordingly, they release all their music through their own Rabid Records. Karin: 'We could never work with anyone who had anything to say about the music. It is very important for us to be totally free, to be able to do whatever we feel like, whenever we feel like it.'</p> <p>What you hear before the politics is staunch, taut electro-pop laced with wonky, singalong choruses that reference 'Double Dutch'-era Malcolm McLaren, Siouxsie Sioux and Eighties soundtrack don Harold Faltermeyer. Deep Cuts is, in their words 'emotional, electronic punk-pop' influenced by techno, grime - specifically Thornton Heath's king of tight instrumentals, Plasticman - Sonic Youth, Ween and new post-punk contenders TV On The Radio. Recorded throughout 2002 in a medieval basement in Stockholm, the album manages to include - among the songs about boys and girls and going out - a lyrical exposition of the argument for paying your taxes. There's also a digital steel drum stomp, 'You Take My Breath Away', named in honour of the Top Gun theme tune. 'I really liked that movie,' says Karin, 'and I must have seen it five times. We also listened a lot to Faltermeyer's soundtrack of [1985 Chevy Chase caper] Fletch while we were making Deep Cuts . It is nothing to be ashamed of.'</p> <p>Before the Knife , Karin played guitar and sang in Gothenburg indie-punk band Honey Is Cool. 'We toured but we weren't that big because people thought we were quite strange. They didn't like my singing. People are obsessed with voices sounding natural - but I don't believe there is such a thing at all.' Meanwhile, Olof was making techno in his bedroom after a stint, aged 13, on saxophone with a ska-punk band called Da Pony Bros. 'We began to work together and found we did not quarrel,' he says. 'Before the Knife , we were not friends.'</p> <p>Aside from healing sibling rivalries, the band has offered the Dreijers some neat opportunities for guerrilla action - which they have taken full advantage of. Instead of attending the Grammy ceremony themselves, they sent a male and female friend with faces painted like gorillas and T-shirts emblazoned with 50:50 in protest at the unequal representation of women in the music industry. 'We thought we would use it as an opportunity to do good,' offers Olof. 'It was in honour of the Guerrilla Girls in America who have made a lot of actions and it was all over the newspapers the next day. Everyone liked it - but I don't know how much it will change the situation.'</p> <p>They watched the show on TV at home the next day. 'The show is not broadcast live but not because they are worried about swearing,' explains Karin. 'This is Sweden! It's because one band said that they wished another band would die in a car crash. Swearing is OK, but not that.'</p>",
  "<p>Through the imposing electronic gates, up the pristine gravel drive, past a small lake glittering in the midday sun and, finally, the big red brick house. A small dog appears from nowhere, yelping and wagging: Arthur. A man appears at the door. Tall, lean, bronzed. He wears pale blue crisp cotton shorts. He smiles, extends a hand: George. He opens the front door, lets the dog bounce in first.</p> <p>The hallway to this mansion on the outskirts of Windsor is bare, functional. Through a heavy wooden door a glimpse of a living room with Old Masters hung on the walls, two heavy sofas - covered in tapestry - endless china vases overflowing with huge exotic flowers. Another figure emerges at the far end of the living room. He walks slowly, with purpose. He is in no hurry perhaps he is tired. He wears a black tracksuit zipped right up, shiny black shoes with a wedge to give him height, both by Yohji Yamamoto, and small red sunglasses.</p> <p>Arthur is ecstatic. He jumps as high as he can to attract his master's attention his master absently pats his head and stands in the middle of the living room. An uncertain smile crosses his face. He extends a hand, gives a dry, firm handshake and flops on to a sofa, legs apart. He asks George to bring him a drink and offers water, every imaginable type of tea, coffee. His skin is pale. He takes off his sunglasses and rubs his bloodshot eyes. He pushes a hand through his reddish hair, makes it stick up a little.</p> <p>The talk is, initially, of football. Elton John is tired, he did a gig last night, but his energy rises as he chats about his interest in the game. His voice is surprisingly deep and sometimes he sounds American but rarely camp. He discusses his years as chairman of Watford FC from 1973 to 2002, when he used to travel to matches home and away. 'I never had any real aggro, just a lot of embarrassing chants.'</p> <p>He smiles, displaying the familiar gap between his teeth, and takes a Versace glass of Diet Coke and ice from a tray. 'Thanks. Nice shorts, George. Saucy. Anyway... You've just got to learn to take it: \"Don't sit round while Elton's around or you'll get a penis up your arse.\"'</p> <p>Elton John says that two things saved his life. Football and music. Music and football. He likes to see himself as a team player - he loved being chairman of the team he supported as a boy and hanging out with manager Graham Taylor and general manager Bertie Mee, and it gave him a reality check in his most decadent years.</p> <p>He sips his Coke. 'I'd turn up at the ground and be told, \"Cor, Elton, what a fucking awful suit that is!\" Or Graham Taylor would sit me down and say, \"You're drinking too much.\" I was doing drugs but I never took my habit to the football ground. Never. If I hadn't had Watford, I really don't know what would have happened to me...'</p> <p>While Watford provided a distraction at weekends, music was always there. When he was taking so many drugs that he can barely remember some of the gigs he performed or the albums he recorded - he reached a peak of taking cocaine on average every four minutes - Elton John never lost sight of his first love. 'At heart I've always been a music fan. That part of me has never changed since I was a little kid, sitting in a room watching a record go round, looking at the colour of the labels. It kept me going through the drugs the fact that I always wanted to hear what was going on.'</p> <p>He sighs. 'I didn't just isolate myself... well, towards the end, before I got clean in 1990, I isolated, but I was still working, still making music.' A wry smile. 'God knows what I was doing, but I was working.'</p> <p>Elton has never stopped working. At 57 he still tours the world and is still adding to his back catalogue. In 2001 he released Songs From the West Coast , his best studio album in years, and in November he brings out Peachtree Road , which is more impressive yet. It is also the first time he has produced his own work. He is at his best when he goes back to his bluesy, piano and vocals roots (the glad-to-be-alive 'The Weight of the World' and the soul-searching 'Answer in the Sky'), but he is also pretty good at country too ('They Call Her The Cat' 'Porch Swing in Tupelo'). That last track references Elvis - 'That truck drivin' boy, with the grease monkey look and the rock'n'roll voice' - who also seems to be the inspiration for the new look he sports when photographed by his friend Sam Taylor-Wood for this interview.</p> <p>Elton says the new album was 'really easy to produce', and he actually enjoyed being in the Peachtree Road studio in Atlanta rather than finding it a chore. 'As always I wrote the music pretty quickly the bulk of it was done within two weeks. I'm quite thrilled with the way it sounds.'</p> <p>While he had already sold 80 million records by the time he was 29 - including Tumbleweed Connection , Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player , the widely acclaimed Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and the epic Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy - Elton recently said he worries that he won't be remembered for his music. He is famous for his ostrich feather body suits, insect sunglasses, bespoke platform boots and hair weaves, for being a gay man who was once married, the original big spender (he readily admits to splashing out over pounds 1m a year on clothes). He has numerous houses in several countries and embraces a coterie of celebrity friends. He is responsible for the bestselling single ever - the re-recorded version of his 1974 hit 'Candle in the Wind' - but raises an eyebrow when asked if it became something of a career albatross.</p> <p>'In a way.' He sighs. 'Rightfully people say, \"Fucking 'Candle in the Wind'.\" Even I wouldn't sing it for two years. It was too painful.' He pauses then says, without prompting: 'I am a victim of my own excess, I admit that. It's been my own doing and I can't blame anyone else.'</p> <p>It is easy to wonder if Elton John wishes he were hip or cool, that his excesses weren't judged, that people remembered great songs such as 'Rocket Man', 'Daniel', 'Good bye Yellow Brick Road', 'Bennie and the Jets' or 'Tiny Dancer' rather than a slushy, sentimental paean to Princess Diana. 'Well, in the beginning I was cool. But I'm not interested in being cool now I just want to be me. The music has fluctuated: it's been great, it's been ordinary and sometimes it's been downright bad. That's going to happen over a 34-year career.'</p> <p>He ruffles the dog's head. 'I'm not everybody's cup of tea. But sometimes criticism can be hurtful. Be respectful I'm a good piano player, I can sing well, I write good songs. If you don't like it, fair enough. But give me a break. I know I'm dismissed sometimes as \"Elton the MOR rocker\" but it's hard to be anything else on piano. It's not an instrument you can throw into an amp or into the audience.'</p> <p>He points out - rightly - that there is too much snobbery in music. He says that if he were starting out now and in his twenties, he might be Chris Martin. 'I don't see the point in criticising Coldplay,' he says, pushing his hand through his hair. 'They are fucking great. They write really fabulous songs. Because they went to university they are somehow less credible? Hello?'</p> <p>He sits forward on the edge of the sofa. 'What a lot of bands don't realise these days is how important it is to have a work ethic. In the old days - the old days! - you had to tour forever in a Transit van and then maybe you'd get a record contract. Now bands get signed too quickly. Look at Oasis: instead of dedicating themselves to breaking America by touring, they spent all their time fighting and ligging. In the end they self-combusted. They became Spinal Tap. You've done 12 shows in the US? Fuck off! If you really want it you have to work hard. Which is exactly what Coldplay have done.'</p> <p>Elton John may worry about not being remembered for his music, but he doesn't know if he would like to be more influential he claims to have not really thought about it. But recently, more and more artists have cited his work, including the Scissor Sisters, Michael Stipe, Courtney Love and Mary J Blige (who borrowed the piano break from 'Bennie and the Jets' for her Grammy-winning 'Deep Inside'). He tips the last of the Coke back and lets his body sink into the sofa. 'It's not hip to say you're a big fan of Elton John , but a lot of people I respect like my work.' He smiles. 'I'm happy with that.'</p> <p>THE KEY TO ELTON JOHN 'S MUSIC IS, OF course, his relationship with Bernie Taupin. By 1963, when he was 16, Reginald Kenneth Dwight had left school and had begun his evolution into Elton Hercules John. By day the self-conscious, shy boy from Pinner, Middlesex worked as a messenger for a music publishing company by night he either performed with Bluesology, a semi-professional backing act for visiting soul musicians, or earned pounds 1 a night playing old piano favourites at a local hotel bar.</p> <p>In the late Sixties, he saw an advert in the NME placed by a record company looking for new talent. He ended up taking away some of Bernie Taupin's lyrics and by the time they met in person six months later, Elton had written the music to some 20 songs. They secured a three-year songwriting contract, with Taupin and John earning pounds 10 and pounds 15 a week respectively. It was an intense but strange period Elton recalls a particularly peculiar project where he had to try to make Nick Drake songs more commercial. 'An impossible task, really,' he says, smiling. 'I needed the money, so I did it.'</p> <p>John and Taupin were obsessed with music. 'We spent all our money on records. We used to go to Music Land in Berwick Street and listen to Joni Mitchell, Hendrix, Dylan, the Beatles. Both of us with headphones on, lying on the floor looking at the gatefold sleeves. It's a lovely, sweet image...'</p> <p>During this period, Bernie lived with Elton at the family flat in Frome Court, Pinner. In the decades that have followed, the lyricist moved to America to live on a ranch ('he became the Brown Dirt Cowboy') and the two have mainly communicated by chatting on the phone every couple of weeks. It is astonishing that Bernie has continuously succeeded in writing lyrics which Elton sings as though they were his own. They have both worked with other people, but they're back as a songwriting duo on Peachtree Road</p> <p>Elton thinks that living apart has kept them close. 'We've always had a great love affair from a distance, and I think that's why we've stayed together. He knows who I am. We've always had that sixth sense. I don't know... when we were both writing with other people we weren't jealous, although we were probably hurt. But we had to do that for the relationship to survive.'</p> <p>He smiles. 'Bernie is one of the loves of my life. He's the best friend I never had at school. It was never a carnal relationship it was all about collecting records, going to gigs. We've never had a real fight. But I do remember him telling me so many times when I was doing drugs that I was an asshole...' He pauses for a moment. 'I can't explain how we work so well together. It just works. It's lucky. It's fate.'</p> <p>Elton knows he was not only lucky enough to meet Bernie early on in his career, but also that he was around at the best possible time. His contemporaries included Bowie, Jagger, Freddie Mercury and Rod Stewart. He could buy 10 albums a week that were brilliant (Soft Machine, Captain Beefheart, Hendrix, Laura Nyro, Buffalo Springfield: he mentions a dozen more in a single breath).</p> <p>He sits forward on the sofa and his eyes shine. 'I grew up out of that British variety, music hall, pantomime era we were all larger than life. The first one was Marc Bolan, who was a dear friend he was completely from another planet. I do like my rock stars to be a little larger than life. I don't mind the earnest ones at all, but I do like a bit of individuality.'</p> <p>Elton's saving grace has, perhaps, been his recent patronage of young artists. When he talks with such childlike enthusiasm about new bands, it is easy to forget 'I'm Still Standing' or 'Nikita'. He still buys dozens of records once a week, whether it's in King's Road, Chelsea or America or Japan.</p> <p>Of course he's smart enough to realise that it looks good for him to hang out with hip young artists, but when Elton John talks about music he seems entirely genuine. So he namechecks bands throughout the conversation: Nirvana's Nevermind is probably the best album of the Nineties (and he once shared a bill with the band but didn't have the courage to say hello to Kurt Cobain) Franz Ferdinand help to wake him up in the morning he's just discovered Jet ('a brilliant pastiche') he appreciates the fun the Darkness are having he loved the Scissor Sisters the minute he heard them.</p> <p>His two current favourites, however, are Rufus Wainwright and Ryan Adams. He eulogises about Rufus for a good 10 minutes while barely pausing for breath. 'He's astonishing. He gets up every day and writes I don't do that. I don't even play the piano unless I have to rehearse. Rufus plays it every day.'</p> <p>He feels protective towards Ryan. The young American's self-destructive streak reminds him of himself. He rings Ryan up from time to time to see how he is. He thinks it's good to offer support he remembers the Band coming to see him in Philadelphia when he was starting out and, as a fan, he was thrilled. But he also knows how hard it can be to ask for help.</p> <p>He fidgets on the sofa. 'It took me 16 years of stubbornness... and craziness... to ask for help. Because I thought it was a sign of weakness. I didn't get sober till 1990 because I struggled to ask for help. So if anybody picks up the phone and asks for a bit of my time, I'll be there for them.'</p> <p>PERHAPS BECAUSE HE'S BEEN THROUGH drug and alcohol addiction, because he outed himself before it was really acceptable or fashionable to be gay, because he's been through years and years of therapy, Elton John finds a lot of people come to him for advice. He grins. 'Let's phone up Uncle Elt!'</p> <p>He is proud of his new role as agony uncle to a new generation of artists. But it would be easy to think of him as envying young bands, as craving the thrill of the first taste of fame. Not so in fact, he can think of nothing worse. 'At the start of my career, I did everything, went everywhere, met everyone. I didn't mind having my photo taken. In fact, I enjoyed it.' He looks terribly serious for the first time. 'Now I'm 57 I loathe it. I find it very difficult to go out without attracting attention... so I'd rather stay home.'</p> <p>He scowls. 'There is no charisma any more. We know everything about everyone. If I see one more photo of Britney or J-Lo or Ben Affleck, I'm going to spit. I want mystery! That's why Morrissey has had some success again he's a bit of an enigma. I know I've cultivated this image of myself having tantrums and spending all this money and having nice weekends in my big house in the south of France... but I really don't think I court publicity like I used to. And I don't want it.'</p> <p>A clock chimes in the background. He glances at his simple but probably incredibly expensive black and white watch. Time is marching on. 'I'll leave all that celebrity stuff to the young guys.'</p> <p>Elton John has lived his life in two parts. The first he spent under the influence of drugs and alcohol. He talks of concerts barely remembered, of hopeless relationships, of spending his money badly ('I collected a lot of appalling art when I was on drugs your judgment is impaired when you're out of your mind'). He remembers one occasion, when he was staying at an American hotel and he'd been up all night, he rang his London management company and screamed: 'It's too fucking windy here - can you do something about it?'</p> <p>Which is not to say he didn't have a great time too, meeting his heroes. He met Brian Wilson when the Beach Boy had taken to playing his piano in a sandpit in the dining room and listened to 'Good Vibrations' until 4am ('I was simultaneously terrified and in awe of this brilliant man, who is probably the biggest influence on my songwriting') he got an autograph from Elvis, though he feels cheated as the king was bloated and 'too gone' he met an 'eccentric' Bob Dylan.</p> <p>In 1973, he spent a lot of time with John Lennon. 'I remember being in a room at the Sherry Netherlands hotel with John and we were both on coke. At 3am there was a knock on the door and we looked through the peephole it was Andy Warhol. We both stood there, paranoid, whispering: don't let him in!'</p> <p>On 29 July 1990, at the age of 43, Elton John got clean. After months in rehab and therapy, he stopped relying on the drugs and alcohol. By way of distraction, he started to collect photography. Not just the odd photo, naturally, but enough to fill a gallery. In the early Nineties he paid pounds 120,000 for Man Ray's Tears , then a world record for a photo. He bought an apartment in Atlanta - the only city in the world, he says, where he can live a relatively normal life - and filled it with pieces by contemporary photographers.</p> <p>He didn't lose his sense of fun - he tells some funny stories about his relationship with Rod Stewart, one that has endured since the early Seventies and that has been defined by practical jokes and wind-ups. 'I bought him a Zimmer frame for his 50th birthday and he sent me one of those old-fashioned ladies' hairdryers you sit underneath with the message: \"The only thing I forgot to buy was the hair to go with it.\" It's like a Joan Crawford/Bette Davis relationship. Rod's never lost his vicious British humour, and that's why I adore him.'</p> <p>On 30 October 1993, Elton John fell in love. He'd been on the road for a long time and wanted to meet new people he had a dinner party at Woodside, the house in Windsor, and David Furnish was one of the guests. Furnish had been a fan - Caribou was the first album he ever bought - and was shy but nonetheless gave Elton his number. 'I knew he was going off to a Halloween party and I always get up very early... I was trying to work out the earliest I could ring on a Sunday morning.'</p> <p>He laughs. 'At 11am I plucked up the courage to make the call. We had dinner in London that night and talked some more. David was the first person I'd been with who had his own apartment, his own job at Ogilvy and Mather, his own circle of friends. He also wasn't afraid to tell me what he thought.'</p> <p>Elton liked being told he was wrong. He liked being chastised for spending too much money it was refreshing for him after so many one-sided relationships in which he'd taken control.'I was so relieved that David was willing to challenge me when I lost it. He knew how to handle me and it wasn't with kid gloves.'</p> <p>There is a song for David on Peachtree Road . 'My Elusive Drug' is a touching, bluesy tribute to Elton's lover, written by Bernie Taupin but sung with aching tenderness. Once again, it seems as though Taupin has been telepathic. Elton laughs. 'I might be wrong because Bernie never tells me but that song screams of the fact that I've been through everything, I've tried everything and finally I've found my elusive drug - David. It's a very special song the Nina Simone song on the album.'</p> <p>Elton John grins. 'It's been 14 years since I got sober. I've got a new album, a great private life, and at 57 I feel excited by life.'</p> <p>As it's such a gorgeous afternoon, we take a walk around Elton's extensive gardens. The dog is over-excited, darting around the Italian garden Elton's late friend Gianni Versace encouraged him to create. He says the past 12 months have been the most creative of his life not just a new album, but Billy Elliot the Musical (he has written the music to the stage production of the Stephen Daldry film, which premieres this autumn in Newcastle), a Broadway production of The Vampire Lestat (based on the first two Anne Rice novels) and the soundtrack to an animated Disney film called Gnomeo and Juliet</p> <p>Then there are the concerts. Alongside his never-ending world tours, Elton is in residency in Las Vegas for the next three years, playing a total of 75 shows, in a lavish production designed by David LaChapelle. But he never forsakes the serious for the superficial his commitment as chairman of the Elton John Aids Foundation is as great as ever, while he also supports breast cancer charities. 'I go out and raise the money I am the whore,' he says. 'But I don't scream about it all the time.'</p> <p>Elton becomes serious for a moment as he contemplates his 60th birthday. 'There will come a time when my lifestyle has to change.. Why I'm still trying to prove something to myself, I don't know. I have a lovely private life with David but we don't spend enough time together.'</p> <p>He pauses, squinting. 'I'm not going to be like the Who and do a farewell tour for the next 15 years, but I am finding it harder, emotionally, to stay on the road.'</p> <p>He looks across the stunning gardens to the house he bought in 1975 in a drugs haze. 'This is home for me. It's where David and I first met. But we don't need the stuff I'd be happy living in a Winnebago with David because I love him so much.' His eyes are watering. Maybe it's the sun.</p> <p>'I always wanted to buy a big fucking retirement home and live in it with all my friends. An old department store in the King's Road would be perfect. I could run the CD shop, Neil Tennant the bookshop and Sam Taylor-Wood the art shop.' He rubs the dog's head. 'Either that or buy a big chateau in France and just walk around in kaftans eating donuts all day.'</p>",
  "<p>Reading The Guardian one Saturday, Sue notices the online-dating service in the Saturday edition. She's been single for four-and-a-half years. After an eight-year relationship, Sue hadn't imagined being single for so long, hadn't expected it. </p> <p>Where are all the men? The ones she knows are already in relationships - or not her type. When she likes the look of a man, she checks his left hand. These days, the ones without wedding rings on always look so much younger than her. 'God. Why on earth would they be interested in someone who's 36?'</p> <p>She's never tried it before, but she logs on and starts filling in the online form. The hardest thing is the five-word summary of what you're looking for that they use as a headline. Sue scrolls through the other profiles. They all say things like: 'Single, happy, intelligent, lively'. What does that mean? Sue wants something that will catch men's eyes, something a bit different, so she writes: 'Lager Curry Kylie Football'.</p> <p>When she goes online to check, a couple of Guardian-reading men have emailed her. Others have put her in their 'favourites' list. Oh my goodness. It works. After all that time, it's nice to have this kind of attention. It's a boost. And when she starts emailing and talking to a few of them, it's fun. One is a bit reticent, but the other is certainly up for it. He's about the same age, concerned about the environment (which is good) - and he does DJ-ing, too. She quite fancies going out with a DJ. After a few weeks they decide to meet. He suggests Fruitstock - the festival sponsored by a smoothie-making company, held in Regent's Park, London. (Good choice. If they don't like each other there's plenty to do.) She takes the train from Bristol. They meet. </p> <p>The moment she sees him, she knows she doesn't fancy him. It's not going to work. It's not that she really expected it to. She's not even sure he fancies her, for that matter. </p> <p>It doesn't matter. It's a beautiful sunny day. The park looks lovely. They watch the bands, sit on the grass and talk. </p> <p>But her date is looking at the band when Sue notices this group on the opposite side of the stage. One of them keeps looking at her. He's in his thirties - the sort of man who looks like he takes care of himself. A nice, warm face. And glasses. Lately she seems to be going for men with glasses. Is he really looking at her? </p> <p>She looks back at him. Eye contact. She's not used to this.</p> <p>The date goes to the bar for another lager. (He does seem to drink quite a lot.) Sue looks again. He's still looking, too. Nervously, they both smile.</p> <p>Should she run over there and give the guy her phone number? She's never done anything like that in her life. Not having had much luck with men in recent years, she doesn't feel confident about approaching him. But then this kind of eye contact doesn't happen to her very often. </p> <p>Would it be too tarty to give him her number? She's supposed to be here on a date. It doesn't feel decent to go behind his back. Maybe that's just an excuse. Sue hesitates. Her date returns. She chats, still sneaking glances.</p> <p>Later, dancing in front of the stage, she promises she'll talk to the guy with glasses if she sees him again. Definitely. Give him her number. But he's disappeared.</p> <p>On the last-but-one train home that night, she's curiously elated. The date didn't work, but it was a lovely, lovely day. And she can't get the guy who smiled at her out of her head. God. How often does that happen?</p>",
  "<p>We had thought about meeting in Hollywood, Nashville or New York. Then the phone rang late at night: could I be at a church an hour outside Chicago at 4.30pm the following day? </p> <p>It was sunny in Joliet, a small town romantically pronounced 'Juliet', and inside the church, a couple were getting married. At the appointed time, I stood at the back, looking for clues amid the congregation. I peered at the bride (though I knew the person I was meeting was already married). I wondered if there was any significance in the church (it was Catholic; she is Protestant). Idle thoughts, but after a week of watching the high-earning action thrillers with which Ashley Judd has made her name, you begin to believe she may conduct her life along similar lines. </p> <p>Just then, I saw a figure wearing a baseball cap and wildly oversized sunglasses, a get-up that shouted 'incognito' so loudly I recognised her at once. Judd shook my hand, introduced me to her two cockapoo dogs, Shug and Buttermilk, and said, as she settled onto a patch of lawn: 'Have you come all this way just for this?' </p> <p>Although this was a touch worthy of Norma Desmond (how could I have had time to plan anything else?), I liked her very much. Underneath her glasses and her cap, she is intriguingly beautiful - not in the dazzling, smoothed-over way she appears on countless magazine covers, nor in the sleek and determined manner of her gutsiest heroines. In the flesh, there is something gentler about her, a little warmth and, perhaps, a little worry, as well as her much-feted poise. </p> <p>After some small talk (Judd was there to accompany her racing driver husband; the circuit was nearby and she just spotted this church yesterday as she drove past), she came right out with it: 'Um,' she said, 'I'm getting a little uptight. Because this is a British newspaper.' </p> <p>And? I asked. </p> <p>'And I don't trust them at all. I was really nervous about this, because we just don't trust anybody from the UK.' </p> <p>Despite the many interesting aspects of her role as Linda Porter in the film she is promoting, De-Lovely, Judd can't be unaware that it received rather thudding American reviews. As Cole Porter's wife, she plays a woman graciously devoted to a genius, despite his many homosexual affairs, but the potential complexity of this is blunted by the film's artless format. Her previous movie, Twisted - in which she plays a homicide cop - was released in the UK a few months ago, and coolly received. </p> <p>But that's not what was bugging her. The problem, she said, was that her supposedly honky-tonk past had become 'so mythologised and ridiculous'. It has been said that Judd grew up 'without running water, without electricity', when the fact is that some of her relatives simply lived 'in an old-timey way by choice'. She is rumoured to have been so poor as a child she had to make her own soap, when she only made soap because her mother was interested in the craft of it. </p> <p>Judd became exasperated as she spoke: 'It's like we're some portrait out of the Depression! It's about titillation, scandal or ruin; at the very least, it has to be about conflict. It's so reductive. It's not even that wonderful thing that Steinbeck said about \"the end is always latent in the beginning\". I don't recognise any of it! There's so much going on with my family story, which I probably will choose never to tell.' </p> <p>She was born days after Martin Luther King was assassinated in the state where she now lives. She is the second daughter of Naomi Judd, a single mother who waitressed her way through college in order to become a nurse and then, when Ashley was 15, formed a singing duo with her other daughter, Wynonna. The Judds became one of the most successful acts in country music and spent their days on the road. Sometimes, Ashley went with them (reportedly making pocket money by cleaning their tour bus) and sometimes shunted between relatives. </p> <p>'I coped very well in certain ways and in other ways I was very uncertain,' she told me. 'I think that school was like a potential disaster and I didn't really come into my own until college. I started to write; I had a lot of really strong feminist teachers.' </p> <p>After studying French at the University of Kentucky, Judd drove a couple of thousand miles to try to make her way in Hollywood. David Letterman once joked: 'The Judds have another girl, but she's so ugly they keep her locked in a basement!', a quip she was soon to lay to rest. Her first film, a thoughtful, low-key independent called Ruby in Paradise, immediately put her on the map as an actress of sincerity and intelligence. But it wasn't until Jodie Foster pulled out of the thriller Double Jeopardy five years ago that she got the part that made the bucks. </p> <p>Since then, Judd has played a series of strong women or, rather, in her own description, 'characters who are hurt in some way, and coping '. She has commanded salaries of more than $8 million, while to some extent turning her back on the Hollywood game. She lives with her husband, Dario Franchitti, and their multitude of pets in a house in Tennessee bought for her by her sister, who lives nearby. At 36, Judd has 'managed to do a lot of correcting' of a childhood she describes as 'totally chaotic'. Her sister once famously described it as 'putting the \"fun\" into \"dysfunctional\".' </p> <p>Part of the problem with the family legend is that one of its chief mythologists is Judd's mother. In 1993, Naomi Judd published an autobiography called Love Can Build a Bridge. It was turned into a TV mini-series; Judd was asked to play her mother and ended up playing herself, a choice which has not prevented her from cursing as soon as the project is mentioned. (Wynonna said at the time that she would write a sequel entitled 'The Truth'.) </p> <p>Now Naomi Judd has written a new self-help book (Naomi's Breakthrough Guide), in which she is given to motherly boasts - Ashley once beat a Nobel laureate at Trivial Pursuit - and more regrettable assertions, such as: 'Ashley is as slick as snot on a doorknob.' </p> <p>How is Judd coping with the uninvited attention? 'Well, my friends have helped me with that. A lot of it is not totally true, but I just gloss over that. She's my mom and it's just as much her experience as it is mine.' </p> <p>Last month, the three Judds went on Oprah. There ostensibly to discuss Wynonna's battle with her weight, the women mentioned a tricky family issue: Wynonna's father was not Ashley's, and Wynonna had not known this until she was 30 (10 years ago), but Ashley had known it all along. Why? </p> <p>'What's more interesting to me,' Judd told me, 'is why I didn't just tell her right away, why I felt complicit in their secrecy. At the age of 17, I didn't realise that I had an independent mind, and could choose. That occurred to me recently. I thought, why the fuck didn't I tell her? I mean, ultimately, I did. I'm the one who told her.' </p> <p>'In my next action movie,' Judd wrote in a diary recently, 'I am going to be an avenging angel of the sisterhood. I am going to work subtly and quietly in the dark, rescuing women from brothels in ways so covert that my movements will go unnoticed as a tiny radio continues to play in the background. Then, for the sequel, I will do a full-on superhero turn, upending poverty, banishing ignorance. I went to Pattaya tonight, an infamous red-light district here in Thailand. Can you tell?' </p> <p>This summer, Judd, who is global ambassador for YouthAids, went on a trip to Cambodia and Thailand and became committed to rescuing some sex workers from their 'bondage'. She is a woman's woman, as might be understood from her background. She speaks of her three best girlfriends with bracing affection, unabashedly calls herself a feminist, is continually campaigning to help women register to vote and generally doing, as she puts it, 'anything Gloria Steinem asks me to'. </p> <p>No matter how grand she may be in some respects - she is, for example, unapologetic about her reliance on her housekeeping 'staff' - Judd has a sensibility for solidarity. For her, to use a favourite word of hers, there is no 'disconnect' between the two. </p> <p>As a teenager, Judd was 'always raising hell about something' and her activism work has allowed her to put to use 'a power I've always known I've had'. She has no more film projects until next year, but is very much looking forward to her next YouthAids trip, to Africa. In the meantime, she will be at home, reading, baking, teaching the odd geography lesson at her niece and nephew's school. She and Dario might try and learn Italian and... </p> <p>Just then, the bride and groom walked up to where we were sitting. 'I apologise,' said the groom. 'I did not recognise you when we walked by.' </p> <p>'That's OK,' Judd replied, with charm. 'You don't need to recognise me - you guys are the stand-out. This is your day.' </p> <p>The bride giggled and said: 'Could you autograph our programme?' </p> <p>Judd looked a little nervous. Someone was taking her picture. She forgot the groom's name as she inscribed their order of service. They chatted. They left. Judd looked resigned. 'Welcome to my life,' she said. </p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong> De-Lovely opens on 1 October</p>",
  "<p>It is not long after midnight, and Los Tigres del Norte are halfway through their set at Rodeo 2,000, a barn-like club near the town of Tyler, Texas. The audience is a sea of bobbing cowboy hats receding into the dark and through the open side doors, steam billows out into the humid summer night.</p> <p>On the dancefloor, stern-faced couples waltz awkwardly in their tight jeans and Texan heels, while stray children and cigarette-vendors push their way through the crush. Further forward, a group of schoolgirls raise their hands as if in prayer, while nearby, a shaven-headed youth in baggy jeans throws gang signs over the head of a middle-aged senora who is mouthing the words to every song.</p> <p>And up on stage, resplendent in silver Stetsons and zebra-striped rodeo suits, Los Tigres sing about the spectacular demise of Mexican drug smuggler Manuel Atillano.</p> <p>The song is called 'El Avion de la Muerte' (The Aeroplane of Death). Over a rollicking accordion line, it narrates how Atillano is captured by the Mexican army, and tortured until he agrees to fly them to the cartel's secret landing strip. Once in the air, he disarms one of the soldiers, seizes control of the plane and snarls that he'd rather die than squeal.</p> <p>With the soldiers weeping and pleading for their lives, he pushes the plane into a nose-dive, aiming for an army base below. But as they plummet earthwards, he sees a crowded school playground just next to the barracks. At the very last moment Atillano wrestles the plane off course, crashing into a hillside - saving the children, but killing both himself and his captors.</p> <p>It's a magnificent, ridiculous song, equal parts grotesquery, sentiment and melodrama. It's also completely true: air traffic controllers recorded the whole sorry incident. This is narcocorrido , a music steeped in the blood and gun-smoke of Mexico's drug wars. Largely invisible to the English-speaking world, it is wildly popular throughout Latin America and among the Chicano population of the USA.</p> <p>To the backing of an accordion, a 12-stringed bajo sexto guitar - and occasionally a full brass band - the songs recount the exploits of daring, brutal drug lords who outwit corrupt policemen and hypocritical gringos. Narcocorrido takes its form from the polkas and waltzes of northern Mexico, and its lyrics blend a documentary eye for detail with a mythologising flair for an outrageously tall tale.</p> <p>For centuries the corrido , or ballad, formed a repository of popular Mexican history, preserving the memory of the most daring bandits, the fastest racehorses, and the cruellest generals.</p> <p>Its golden age came during the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1917, when corridistas churned out thousands of songs: musical dispatches through which the largely illiterate population could follow the progress of the war.</p> <p>By the Fifties, musicologists believed it was a dying form, but in the Seventies, the corrido was reborn, with shoot-outs and drug-runners replacing bandoleros and revolution. Nowadays, a narcocorrido set-list reads like a potted history of the Mexican drug industry: there are songs about every major trafficker of the past 30 years, and if they are occasionally a touch formulaic, it's only because they tend to culminate in the violent death of the protagonist.</p> <p>Inevitably, they are not to everyone's taste: educated Mexicans are scandalised by what they see as the debasement of a noble folk tradition, the Catholic Church has denounced corridistas for glorifying the drugs trade, and at least five Mexican states have banned radios from airing the music. But like gangsta rap, narcocorrido has thrived on the controversy - despite the ban, it has massive support from its fans.</p> <p>TONIGHT, AT LEAST 4,000 PEOPLE HAVE crammed into the Rodeo 2000 to see Los Tigres, and - apart from me and Luca the photographer - there is not an Anglo in the house. Most of the fans are Mexican and Central American, and many of them are illegal immigrants employed on the vast flower farms nearby. As a hail of pre-recorded gunfire signals a new song, a drunk with a drooping moustache asks me if I work for la migra . When I assure him that I am nothing to do with the immigration service, he bear hugs me, and gestures proudly at the band. 'This is music for the people,' he bellows. ' Musica para la raza .'</p> <p>It seems a strange comment to make: the song, 'Jefe de Jefes' (The Boss of Bosses), is written in the voice of a shadowy drug kingpin - hardly a representative of ordinary working folk. But as I watch the exhausted flower-pickers sing along with every word, it becomes clear that this is exactly why they are entranced by the figure of the swaggering antihero.</p> <p>'I am the boss of bosses,' they sing. 'Respected at all levels/Many want to climb as high, but see how they fall/They want to steal my crown, but those who tried have all died.'</p> <p>The next morning I meet Jorge Hernandez, the band's lead singer and accordionist, who formed the band in 1968 with two younger brothers, a cousin and a friend. They grew up in a remote Mexican hill village, and although they have lived in California for many years, they have never forgotten the world they left behind.</p> <p>In much of rural Mexico, farmers see marijuana and opium poppy as their only way of escaping poverty, and in regions where the government has failed to provide even the most basic services, drug dealers have become heroes for creating jobs and building schools, churches and roads.</p> <p>'Poor people idolise the narcos: they admire their bravery, and they want to be like them. When you sing the songs, the audience feel that they're living through the characters, as if they were watching a film. That's why people love the corrido. It lets them dream,' Hernandez says.</p> <p>Many of Los Tigres's songs are inspired by events in newspaper reports, or stories passed on by fans. But Hernandez says that even the corridos featuring fictional characters reflect the realities of Mexican life.</p> <p>In a country where politicians are routinely exposed as corrupt, newspapers are bribed or threatened into silence, and the police are widely believed to commit more crimes than they solve, people look to the corrido for the truth, he says. 'People believe a corrido much more than anything the authorities tell them.'</p> <p>This is why the drug ballad has thrived, says Manuel Valenzuela, a sociologist and author of a book on Mexico's drug culture. 'The corrido has always been a way for the underdogs to express their opinion - which is often very different from the official government version of history.'</p> <p>Narcocorridos can be seen as an attempt to make some kind of sense of the spread of drug-fuelled violence and corruption. 'Drug trafficking permeates our whole society: politics, the military, the church and big business have all been corrupted,' says Valenzuela.</p> <p>By bribe or bullet, the drug trade has imposed its own morality on wider society: one recent opinion poll showed that most young Mexicans believe that there is no qualitative difference between a trafficker and a policeman. 'We don't know who are the good guys and who are the bad guys,' sighs Valenzuela.</p> <p>As you fly west over Texas, the lush pastureland and whitewashed farms gradually give way to scrubby hills dotted with trailer-homes - and then eventually to the desert, inhabited solely by clusters of oil wells.</p> <p>From here to California the frontier is little more than an idea - an invisible line along 2,000 miles of sand and mountain.</p> <p>Undeclared goods have been traded across the border since it was first delineated in 1848, but large-scale smuggling did not begin until 1920, when Prohibition created a new market for bootleg tequila.</p> <p>With the end of Prohibition in 1933, the smugglers turned to other goods: morphine, heroin and marijuana. One year later, the first known narcocorrido was published. 'El Contrabandista', or The Smuggler, tells the story of a Mexican smuggler who is captured by Texas Rangers after diversifying from tequila to 'cocaine, morphine and marijuana'.</p> <p>Since then, the drug-running has never stopped. In the Sixties, traffickers shipped their loads in light aircraft by the Eighties they were sending fleets of converted 747s. Nowadays, they simply drive across the desert in air-conditioned SUVs.</p> <p>Jose Angel Lopez admits that he was not a very successful smuggler: on his first run to the border, he was arrested with a truckload of marijuana, and he is now three years into an eight-year prison sentence in Ciudad Juarez - a sprawling, violent city just across the border from El Paso, Texas. Juarez jail is a massive complex on the outskirts of town. Black-clad guards with assault rifles patrol its 40-foot walls, and all around bales of razor-wire glitter in the harsh desert sun. Despite the jail's grim exterior, the regime is fairly liberal and inmates earn extra cash by selling food, handicrafts - and drug ballads.</p> <p>Jose Angel is the lead singer of corrido quartet Los Compas del Norte (The Mates of the North), whose members are all doing time on drugs charges. Immaculately dressed in pressed jeans and crocodile skin cowboy boots, they stroll the yard playing requests to their fellow inmates, charging a pound for every song.</p> <p>Classic narcocorridos with names like 'Contrabando y Traicion' (Contraband and Treachery) and 'La Pista Secreta' (The Secret Landing Strip) - are the most popular, although Jose Angel claims that prison has soured his taste for dope songs. 'When I used to listen to corridos I thought the narcos were so cool and daring. Now I'm inside I can see the other side of the coin,' he says, although his tone of contrition may have something to do with the guards who hover just within earshot as we speak.</p> <p>Angel also writes on commission for other prisoners, charging pounds 50 per song. 'I write about love, women, friendship,' he says. This may well be true, but his patrons seem more interested in songs about the very misdeeds which landed them in jail.</p> <p>The lyrics of Angel's prison-recorded CD The Forgotten Prisoner revolve around wild shoot-outs, fragrant marijuana buds and midnight border runs. 'People like to hear songs about themselves,' shrugs Jose. 'You have to exaggerate a little sometimes, but it's all basically true.'</p> <p>NO EXAGGERATION IS NECESSARY IN telling the story of Angel's idol, Rosalino 'Chalino' Sanchez, a singer who also began his career in jail, but went on to become the first and greatest star of narcocorrido.</p> <p>Sanchez was born in the badlands of Sinaloa, a state in north west Mexico known best for the quality of its marijuana and the fiery temperament of its inhabitants.</p> <p>When he was 15, Sanchez shot and killed a man who had raped his sister, and fled to California, where for a while he worked as a 'coyote', smuggling illegal immigrants and drugs across the border. Only when he was arrested, and spent nearly a year in Tijuana prison, did he discover his skill at songwriting. Like Angel, he began composing corridos for fellow inmates, and once outside, found his skills in demand from both dealers and legitimate immigrants.</p> <p>With his throaty and tuneless voice, Sanchez was never a great singer his real talent was as a lyricist. At the time, corridistas told their stories in the playful tone of a comic book or action movie, but he revelled in the savage reality of the underworld, peppering his songs with gory details of torture and execution.</p> <p>Everything about 'Chalino' Sanchez signalled his distance from the crooning loverboys of mainstream Mexican pop: plainly dressed in cotton shirts and jeans, his one accessory was the handgun always tucked in his belt. He was the archetypal Mexican valiente - a hard man. During a concert in early 1992, Chalino was shot in the side by a member of the audience. Wounded, the singer drew his revolver and returned fire, and in the ensuing gun battle seven people were injured, and at least one was killed.</p> <p>The shooting reinforced his reputation, sending his record sales through the roof - but it was also a sign that the line between his art and his life was now dangerously blurred.</p> <p>That May, as Sanchez left a concert in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, he was forced into a car by a group of men with police IDs. At dawn the next day, his body was found lying near a canal. He had been shot twice in the back of the head.</p> <p>Nobody was ever arrested for the murder, but death turned 'Chalino' Sanchez into a Mexican version of Tupac Shakur. He became a legend, producing more posthumous records than he did in life, and spawning an army of imitators, all of them singing in his trademark guttural style.</p> <p>'Chalino revolutionised the corrido, in the way he sang and the subjects he sang about. He invented the corrido bravo - the thug corrido,' says Jose Manuel Camargo, who, performing as El As de la Sierra (The Ace of the Sierra), is one of the many singers inspired by Chalino. I meet the Ace several days after leaving Juarez. From the border, the road winds south, through the Chihuahua and Durango deserts, then up into the pine-clad mountains of Sinaloa. The Sierra Madre Occidental is the heartland of Mexico's drug-trade: its cloud-swathed peaks and deep shaded valleys hide hundreds of marijuana plantations, opium fields and secret landing strips.</p> <p>This is where the Ace grew up in a peasant family, who lived off their marijuana patch. Now he lives in Los Mochis, a dusty town near the Pacific coast, and it soon becomes clear that his circumstances have changed dramatically.</p> <p>At the bus station in Mochis, Luca and I are greeted by two thickset men who identify themselves as the Ace's bodyguards. They hustle us into the cab of a pick-up truck with tinted windows, and as we drive through the city, the driver mutters cryptically into a walkie-talkie. After a dozen or so blocks, we rendezvous with three more trucks, and barrel out of town in a high-speed convoy, heading for the Ace's country retreat.</p> <p>Ten minutes later, we turn off the main highway and bounce down a dusty track, pulling to a halt in a dusty barbed wire compound. Half a dozen bodyguards fan out from the trucks, and when they are in position, the Ace slowly climbs down from the driving seat of his gleaming landcruiser.</p> <p>Under a bespoke Stetson, Jose Manuel cuts a slight figure, stooping under a mass of golden jewellery hanging from his neck and arms. His shirt and jeans are Versace, his belt and boots ostrich skin and tucked in his waistband is an automatic pistol.</p> <p>The Ace offers us a cool glass of water, then shows us round the ranchito: the collection of wild deer and peacocks, the plain one-storey farmhouse - and near the fence of thorny cacti, a stray marijuana plant. Sniffing the buds, he nods approvingly. 'Nearly ripe,' he says. 'Everyone in the Sierra grows marijuana - up there, you can't make a living from anything else.'</p> <p>His cousins still grow dope, but Jose says that he no longer needs to - his relationship with the drug industry is much more profitable. Like his namesake in Juarez jail, he composes songs to order - but the Ace's clients include some of the most feared and powerful gangsters in Mexico.</p> <p>'I have a lot of fans who are... well, I call them business people. Mafia people, if you like,' he says. 'It's nice to sing about them.'</p> <p>It's lucrative work: the Ace can charge up to $30,000 for a brand-new corrido - although he will sometimes waive the fee for a friend. 'It's my job. If somebody pays me to do a corrido, I'll do it. If they're a Mafioso or not, it's all the same to me,' he says.</p> <p>One of the Ace's best known songs was written about Hector 'Whitey' Palma, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, arrested in 1995 after a plane crash. Palma was imprisoned for ordering the murder of a state attorney general, but according to the Ace's corrido: 'His rivals in jail and outside are trembling/ They know what he is capable of/ When it's time to pay, they'll pay with their skins.'</p> <p>On his latest CD, the Ace included an account of the capture this January of Palma's lieutenant and hit man, Javier Torres Felix. 'We had friends in common,' he shrugs. 'He was caught, and three days later I'd written the corrido.'</p> <p>One of the minders gives a warning shout, and moments later, a police cruiser slows to a halt at the compound gate. The Ace raises a hand to the officer at the wheel, who stares briefly, nods, and the car rolls on. 'I pay those guys a special tax every month,' he says. 'Just so there aren't any problems.'</p> <p>Not all problems can be so easily avoided: the Ace's relationship with the Sinaloa drug lords has earned him the enmity of rival Mafia groups - hence the bodyguards - and several Mexican cities have been removed from his tour schedules. He is not the first corrido singer to have cosied up to the cartels. In 1997 a police informer told his handlers that Los Tucanes de Tijuana, the Toucans of Tijuana, were sponsored by Ramon Arellano-Felix, who with his brother Benjamin headed the Tijuana drug cartel.</p> <p>In a transcript of his statement which was leaked to a Mexican magazine, the informer said that Los Tucanes had written songs about specific murders carried out by the brothers. 'If you listen carefully, the songs tell how the Arellanos killed these people. I don't know how he gets his information.'</p> <p>According to the informer, the cartel used the group's music to lay out a code of conduct for its members: 'Through the corridos comes the philosophy, how the mem bers of the cartel have to behave. They tell you what they did wrong. Why they were killed. You learn what you have to do so they won't kill you.'</p> <p>Following the arrests of a number of high-profile bosses, this year has seen a surge in drug-related violence. According to Mexican newspapers, the killers often taunt the authorities by jamming police radio frequencies with narcocorridos.</p> <p>On the day I reach Culiacan, a young police commander is shot dead on the city's main shopping street - a typical Mafia hit, says veteran local journalist Gilberto Castro. It's a high-profile murder, but not a rarity: the city has a population of just 600,000, but sees an average of two killings every day. 'People kill just to have a song written about them. Or they get themselves killed and end up in a song,' says Castro. 'In the underworld you gain immortality through the words of a corrido - and if you aren't bad, nobody will write about you.'</p> <p>He takes me to the shrine of Jesus Malverde - a mythical Robin Hood-style bandit who has become a local folk hero and the patron saint of drug traffickers. Inside the chapel, a bust of Malverde stands next to the Virgin Mary. With his solemn gaze and luxuriant black moustache, he has the air of a matinee idol.</p> <p>Every year, drug smugglers come here and pray to Malverde for a bountiful harvest, protection from their enemies, and good luck at the frontier. Around the altar, worshippers light votive candles, or leave offerings - dollar bills, toy trucks, tapes of narcocorridos. 'Thank you Malverde for protecting me from enemies and watching over the road I travel. From Culiacan to Chicago,' reads one plaque on the chapel wall. On another, a worshipper thanks Malverde for getting him out of prison.</p> <p>A trio of musicians - accordion, bajo sexto and double bass - drift in and launch into one of the many corridos written about the narco-saint - another offering from a grateful supplicant. When they finish, I ask the bass player if he knows who ordered the song, but he shrugs off the question, and they strike up another tune. It's an old number by los Tigres called 'Pacas de a kilo' (One-kilo Packets): 'I take off my planes in two or three hundred metres, I handle machine guns of various calibres/People are saying that one day I'll be killed/But grudges don't scare me - I know how to win and I know how to lose.'</p> <p>There are bands like this all over town. Freelance musicians at the lowest end of the corrido hierarchy, they wait on street corners or stroll through the flyblown cantinas, where for a pound a shot, they can offer you three minutes of glory.</p> <p>ON MY LAST DAY IN CULIACAN, I WANDER into a nameless cantina near the market and order a beer. It is only 3pm but there are already a handful of drunks propped against the bar. In the stained wood of my table, somebody has scratched the word 'perico' - cocaine - and the outline of a dagger. At the next table, there are two musicians - an accordionist named Margarito Florez, and his brother, Inez, who idly strums a guitar as we talk.</p> <p>'There are so many stories in Mexico. The words of the corrido come straight from the pages of the newspaper - you just have to add music and, there, you have a new song,' he says.</p> <p>'It's all true,' agrees Margarito. 'Take this police commander who was shot the other day. Four killers, and the policeman shooting back. It's already a corrido.'</p> <p>Inez agrees enthusiastically, but points out that there were in fact five killers, or maybe six. Since the day of the shooting, I have been told the story several dozen times, and it seems that with each retelling the details are subtly different: they grow a little more dramatic perhaps, or a touch more tragic. As Margarito and Inez argue over what really happened that day in Culiacan, it seems that they are no longer describing yet another sordid killing in the endless war on drugs. Over the chords of Inez's guitar, the murder is already slipping from the world of cold fact into the mythical reality of narcocorrido.</p>",
  "<p>Not owning a TV myself, I haven't actually seen any of those 'builder from hell' programmes which the medium delights in. I always know when they've been on, though. I have worked as a self-employed electrician for more than 20 years, and I've lost count of the times when, on arriving at a client's house, I've had a rerun of the previous night's horror stories. </p> <p>Of course, a TV series on polite, responsible and honest builders would not provide the required level of drama. They do exist, however, and based on my own experience, I'd like to offer a brief guide to handling the client-builder relationship. </p> <p>I'm primarily speaking to those unfortunates who are about to 'call the man in', but if any of my fellow tradesmen see it I hope it may enlighten them too. I use the masculine pronoun deliberately, as I am not in a position to speak for the many tradeswomen out there. </p> <p>To begin with, I ask only two things of the people I work for: that they give me clear instructions, and pay their bills on time. For a client, any attempt to ice this simple cake will be met with covert derision and cynicism. </p> <p>For example, I often hear at the start of a job: 'Oh you must come to dinner when the work is finished!' I can no longer bring myself to smile ingratiatingly at this, and simply reply with the truth, which is, that by the halfway point of the job or earlier, you will never want to see me again, ever. Nothing personal, it's just that weeks of dust, noise and the sheer invasion of personal space would try anyone's goodwill. </p> <p>Another way to raise a cloud of scepticism is to say: 'I'll tell all my friends about you, they need lots of work doing.' This is invariably said before the work starts, with the hope that you will work especially hard and cheaply in expectation of recommendations. All builders know, however, that having heard this, they will never again hear from the client or anyone known to him, no matter how well the job has gone. </p> <p>Once the work has begun, don't confuse the issue by making whimsical changes which disrupt the flow, and don't expect the builder to make design decisions for you unless you are paying him a designer's fee. In my field, I will do anything you want as long as it doesn't conflict with the wiring regulations, but I can't get too emotionally involved over your choice of ceiling light. </p> <p>If you are a couple, try not to disagree too violently with each other when settling the details of the work, as builders are not generally trained as counsellors, and find it difficult to pretend agreement with two points of view at the same time, especially when they think both are daft anyway. In this situation I calm myself by means of the following mantra: 'The customer is right, even when they're wrong...' </p> <p>When the work has started, turn the central heating off. What is comfortable for you sitting at the word processor is unbearable for anyone doing strenuous physical work. The job will go faster and tempers will remain steady if the temperature is kept low - you can always plug in a heater for the room you are using. </p> <p>Best of all is for you to go out and come back about five minutes before the day's work ends, provided you don't then insist on a lengthy progress report when your man wants to go home. Save it for the morning, which will give you a chance to examine the day's work in private. If you don't trust the builder to be left alone, you have hired the wrong one. </p> <p>So, how to find the right builder? Personal recom mendations are not necessarily the best way. I have seen many cases where someone who has made a good job of, say, fitting some shelves, has been employed to put up a two-storey extension and has proved completely unfit for a job of that size. Try to determine the extent of his experience and look at some of his previous jobs if possible. </p> <p>Take a look at his van - if the wing mirror is held on by sticky tape, it doesn't mean that he is so good he is too busy to fix it. It just means that he is sloppy. It is also a bad sign if he can start work straight away - good tradesmen are always busy and you should expect to wait for at least a week or two. </p> <p>If he is claiming any trade qualifications, such as enrolment with Corgi or the NICEIC (for plumbers and electricians respectively), phone those organisations and check. Many of those claims are fraudulent, so if you find a tradesman who is cheating, report him to the relevant organisation. Don't be too embarrassed to ask for evidence of valid public liability insurance - if none is forthcoming, go elsewhere. </p> <p>Never, never, never allow a job to start without getting something in writing. Depending on the size of the job, it doesn't have to be a full contract, but at least get a detailed written specification with terms of payment, and make sure your builder signs it. Even with goodwill on both sides, the possibilities for misunderstanding in verbal agreements are immense. </p> <p>Make all payments by cheque, insist on invoices, and don't offer to pay cash, hoping for a discount. You are employing a professional, so treat him with at least as much respect as you would offer to your doctor or solicitor. </p> <p>Finally, if you think you are being clever by getting three quotations, bear in mind that not all builders work to the same standards, and it may be a false economy to go for the cheapest. It also takes time and therefore money to price jobs which end up going to the competition, so don't be surprised if you are asked to pay a fee for an estimate (usually refundable on acceptance). You will probably get a great deal of useful advice and information from anyone coming to look at the work, so don't begrudge paying for it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:jones@elecserve.freeserve.co.uk\">jones@elecserve.freeserve.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Through the imposing electronic gates, up the pristine gravel drive, past a small lake glittering in the midday sun and, finally, the big red brick house. A small dog appears from nowhere, yelping and wagging: Arthur. A man appears at the door. Tall, lean, bronzed. He wears pale blue crisp cotton shorts. He smiles, extends a hand: George. He opens the front door, lets the dog bounce in first. </p> <p>The hallway to this mansion on the outskirts of Windsor is bare, functional. Through a heavy wooden door a glimpse of a living room with Old Masters hung on the walls, two heavy sofas - covered in tapestry - endless china vases overflowing with huge exotic flowers. Another figure emerges at the far end of the living room. He walks slowly, with purpose. He is in no hurry; perhaps he is tired. He wears a black tracksuit zipped right up, shiny black shoes with a wedge to give him height, both by Yohji Yamamoto, and small red sunglasses. </p> <p>Arthur is ecstatic. He jumps as high as he can to attract his master's attention; his master absently pats his head and stands in the middle of the living room. An uncertain smile crosses his face. He extends a hand, gives a dry, firm handshake and flops on to a sofa, legs apart. He asks George to bring him a drink and offers water, every imaginable type of tea, coffee. His skin is pale. He takes off his sunglasses and rubs his bloodshot eyes. He pushes a hand through his reddish hair, makes it stick up a little. </p> <p>The talk is, initially, of football. Elton John is tired, he did a gig last night, but his energy rises as he chats about his interest in the game. His voice is surprisingly deep and sometimes he sounds American but rarely camp. He discusses his years as chairman of Watford FC from 1973 to 2002, when he used to travel to matches home and away. 'I never had any real aggro, just a lot of embarrassing chants.'</p> <p>He smiles, displaying the familiar gap between his teeth, and takes a Versace glass of Diet Coke and ice from a tray. 'Thanks. Nice shorts, George. Saucy. Anyway ... You've just got to learn to take it: \"Don't sit round while Elton's around or you'll get a penis up your arse.\"' </p> <p>Elton John says that two things saved his life. Football and music. Music and football. He likes to see himself as a team player - he loved being chairman of the team he supported as a boy and hanging out with manager Graham Taylor and general manager Bertie Mee, and it gave him a reality check in his most decadent years. </p> <p>He sips his Coke. 'I'd turn up at the ground and be told, \"Cor, Elton, what a fucking awful suit that is!\" Or Graham Taylor would sit me down and say, \"You're drinking too much.\" I was doing drugs but I never took my habit to the football ground. Never. If I hadn't had Watford, I really don't know what would have happened to me ...' </p> <p>While Watford provided a distraction at weekends, music was always there. When he was taking so many drugs that he can barely remember some of the gigs he performed or the albums he recorded - he reached a peak of taking cocaine on average every four minutes - Elton John never lost sight of his first love. 'At heart I've always been a music fan. That part of me has never changed since I was a little kid, sitting in a room watching a record go round, looking at the colour of the labels. It kept me going through the drugs; the fact that I always wanted to hear what was going on.' </p> <p>He sighs. 'I didn't just isolate myself ... well, towards the end, before I got clean in 1990, I isolated, but I was still working, still making music.' A wry smile. 'God knows what I was doing, but I was working.' </p> <p>Elton has never stopped working. At 57 he still tours the world and is still adding to his back catalogue. In 2001 he released Songs From the West Coast, his best studio album in years, and in November he brings out Peachtree Road, which is more impressive yet. It is also the first time he has produced his own work. He is at his best when he goes back to his bluesy, piano and vocals roots (the glad-to-be-alive 'The Weight of the World' and the soul-searching 'Answer in the Sky'), but he is also pretty good at country too ('They Call Her The Cat'; 'Porch Swing in Tupelo'). That last track references Elvis - 'That truck drivin' boy, with the grease monkey look and the rock'n'roll voice' - who also seems to be the inspiration for the new look he sports when photographed by his friend Sam Taylor-Wood for this interview. </p> <p>Elton says the new album was 'really easy to produce', and he actually enjoyed being in the Peachtree Road studio in Atlanta rather than finding it a chore. 'As always I wrote the music pretty quickly; the bulk of it was done within two weeks. I'm quite thrilled with the way it sounds.' </p> <p>While he had already sold 80 million records by the time he was 29 - including Tumbleweed Connection, Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player, the widely acclaimed Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and the epic Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy - Elton recently said he worries that he won't be remembered for his music. He is famous for his ostrich feather body suits, insect sunglasses, bespoke platform boots and hair weaves, for being a gay man who was once married, the original big spender (he readily admits to splashing out over \u00a31m a year on clothes). He has numerous houses in several countries and embraces a coterie of celebrity friends. He is responsible for the bestselling single ever - the re-recorded version of his 1974 hit 'Candle in the Wind' - but raises an eyebrow when asked if it became something of a career albatross.</p> <p>'In a way.' He sighs. 'Rightfully people say, \"Fucking 'Candle in the Wind'.\" Even I wouldn't sing it for two years. It was too painful.' He pauses then says, without prompting: 'I am a victim of my own excess, I admit that. It's been my own doing and I can't blame anyone else.' </p> <p>It is easy to wonder if Elton John wishes he were hip or cool, that his excesses weren't judged, that people remembered great songs such as 'Rocket Man', 'Daniel', 'Good bye Yellow Brick Road', 'Bennie and the Jets' or 'Tiny Dancer' rather than a slushy, sentimental paean to Princess Diana. 'Well, in the beginning I was cool. But I'm not interested in being cool now; I just want to be me. The music has fluctuated: it's been great, it's been ordinary and sometimes it's been downright bad. That's going to happen over a 34-year career.'</p> <p>He ruffles the dog's head. 'I'm not everybody's cup of tea. But sometimes criticism can be hurtful. Be respectful; I'm a good piano player, I can sing well, I write good songs. If you don't like it, fair enough. But give me a break. I know I'm dismissed sometimes as \"Elton the MOR rocker\" but it's hard to be anything else on piano. It's not an instrument you can throw into an amp or into the audience.'</p> <p>He points out - rightly - that there is too much snobbery in music. He says that if he were starting out now and in his twenties, he might be Chris Martin. 'I don't see the point in criticising Coldplay,' he says, pushing his hand through his hair. 'They are fucking great. They write really fabulous songs. Because they went to university they are somehow less credible? Hello?' </p> <p>He sits forward on the edge of the sofa. 'What a lot of bands don't realise these days is how important it is to have a work ethic. In the old days - the old days! - you had to tour forever in a Transit van and then maybe you'd get a record contract. Now bands get signed too quickly. Look at Oasis: instead of dedicating themselves to breaking America by touring, they spent all their time fighting and ligging. In the end they self-combusted. They became Spinal Tap. You've done 12 shows in the US? Fuck off! If you really want it you have to work hard. Which is exactly what Coldplay have done.' </p> <p>Elton John may worry about not being remembered for his music, but he doesn't know if he would like to be more influential; he claims to have not really thought about it. But recently, more and more artists have cited his work, including the Scissor Sisters, Michael Stipe, Courtney Love and Mary J Blige (who borrowed the piano break from 'Bennie and the Jets' for her Grammy-winning 'Deep Inside'). He tips the last of the Coke back and lets his body sink into the sofa. 'It's not hip to say you're a big fan of Elton John, but a lot of people I respect like my work.' He smiles. 'I'm happy with that.' </p> <p>The key to Elton John's music is, of course, his relationship with Bernie Taupin. By 1963, when he was 16, Reginald Kenneth Dwight had left school and had begun his evolution into Elton Hercules John. By day the self-conscious, shy boy from Pinner, Middlesex worked as a messenger for a music publishing company; by night he either performed with Bluesology, a semi-professional backing act for visiting soul musicians, or earned \u00a31 a night playing old piano favourites at a local hotel bar. </p> <p>In the late Sixties, he saw an advert in the NME placed by a record company looking for new talent. He ended up taking away some of Bernie Taupin's lyrics and by the time they met in person six months later, Elton had written the music to some 20 songs. They secured a three-year songwriting contract, with Taupin and John earning \u00a310 and \u00a315 a week respectively. It was an intense but strange period; Elton recalls a particularly peculiar project where he had to try to make Nick Drake songs more commercial. 'An impossible task, really,' he says, smiling. 'I needed the money, so I did it.' </p> <p>John and Taupin were obsessed with music. 'We spent all our money on records. We used to go to Music Land in Berwick Street and listen to Joni Mitchell, Hendrix, Dylan, the Beatles. Both of us with headphones on, lying on the floor looking at the gatefold sleeves. It's a lovely, sweet image ...' </p> <p>During this period, Bernie lived with Elton at the family flat in Frome Court, Pinner. In the decades that have followed, the lyricist moved to America to live on a ranch ('he became the Brown Dirt Cowboy') and the two have mainly communicated by chatting on the phone every couple of weeks. It is astonishing that Bernie has continuously succeeded in writing lyrics which Elton sings as though they were his own. They have both worked with other people, but they're back as a songwriting duo on Peachtree Road. </p> <p>Elton thinks that living apart has kept them close. 'We've always had a great love affair from a distance, and I think that's why we've stayed together. He knows who I am. We've always had that sixth sense. I don't know ... when we were both writing with other people we weren't jealous, although we were probably hurt. But we had to do that for the relationship to survive.' </p> <p>He smiles. 'Bernie is one of the loves of my life. He's the best friend I never had at school. It was never a carnal relationship; it was all about collecting records, going to gigs. We've never had a real fight. But I do remember him telling me so many times when I was doing drugs that I was an asshole ...' He pauses for a moment. 'I can't explain how we work so well together. It just works. It's lucky. It's fate.' </p> <p>Elton knows he was not only lucky enough to meet Bernie early on in his career, but also that he was around at the best possible time. His contemporaries included Bowie, Jagger, Freddie Mercury and Rod Stewart. He could buy 10 albums a week that were brilliant (Soft Machine, Captain Beefheart, Hendrix, Laura Nyro, Buffalo Springfield: he mentions a dozen more in a single breath). </p> <p>He sits forward on the sofa and his eyes shine. 'I grew up out of that British variety, music hall, pantomime era; we were all larger than life. The first one was Marc Bolan, who was a dear friend; he was completely from another planet. I do like my rock stars to be a little larger than life. I don't mind the earnest ones at all, but I do like a bit of individuality.' </p> <p>Elton's saving grace has, perhaps, been his recent patronage of young artists. When he talks with such childlike enthusiasm about new bands, it is easy to forget 'I'm Still Standing' or 'Nikita'. He still buys dozens of records once a week, whether it's in King's Road, Chelsea or America or Japan. </p> <p>Of course he's smart enough to realise that it looks good for him to hang out with hip young artists, but when Elton John talks about music he seems entirely genuine. So he namechecks bands throughout the conversation: Nirvana's Nevermind is probably the best album of the Nineties (and he once shared a bill with the band but didn't have the courage to say hello to Kurt Cobain); Franz Ferdinand help to wake him up in the morning; he's just discovered Jet ('a brilliant pastiche'); he appreciates the fun the Darkness are having; he loved the Scissor Sisters the minute he heard them. </p> <p>His two current favourites, however, are Rufus Wainwright and Ryan Adams. He eulogises about Rufus for a good 10 minutes while barely pausing for breath. 'He's astonishing. He gets up every day and writes; I don't do that. I don't even play the piano unless I have to rehearse. Rufus plays it every day.' </p> <p>He feels protective towards Ryan. The young American's self-destructive streak reminds him of himself. He rings Ryan up from time to time to see how he is. He thinks it's good to offer support; he remembers the Band coming to see him in Philadelphia when he was starting out and, as a fan, he was thrilled. But he also knows how hard it can be to ask for help. </p> <p>He fidgets on the sofa. 'It took me 16 years of stubbornness ... and craziness ... to ask for help. Because I thought it was a sign of weakness. I didn't get sober till 1990 because I struggled to ask for help. So if anybody picks up the phone and asks for a bit of my time, I'll be there for them.' </p> <p>Perhaps it's because he's been through drug and alcohol addiction, because he outed himself before it was really acceptable or fashionable to be gay, because he's been through years and years of therapy, Elton John finds a lot of people come to him for advice. He grins. 'Let's phone up Uncle Elt!' </p> <p>He is proud of his new role as agony uncle to a new generation of artists. But it would be easy to think of him as envying young bands, as craving the thrill of the first taste of fame. Not so; in fact, he can think of nothing worse. 'At the start of my career, I did everything, went everywhere, met everyone. I didn't mind having my photo taken. In fact, I enjoyed it.' He looks terribly serious for the first time. 'Now I'm 57 I loathe it. I find it very difficult to go out without attracting attention ... so I'd rather stay home.' </p> <p>He scowls. 'There is no charisma any more. We know everything about everyone. If I see one more photo of Britney or J-Lo or Ben Affleck, I'm going to spit. I want mystery! That's why Morrissey has had some success again; he's a bit of an enigma. I know I've cultivated this image of myself having tantrums and spending all this money and having nice weekends in my big house in the south of France ... but I really don't think I court publicity like I used to. And I don't want it.' </p> <p>A clock chimes in the background. He glances at his simple but probably incredibly expensive black and white watch. Time is marching on. 'I'll leave all that celebrity stuff to the young guys.' </p> <p>Elton John has lived his life in two parts. The first he spent under the influence of drugs and alcohol. He talks of concerts barely remembered, of hopeless relationships, of spending his money badly ('I collected a lot of appalling art when I was on drugs; your judgment is impaired when you're out of your mind'). He remembers one occasion, when he was staying at an American hotel and he'd been up all night, he rang his London management company and screamed: 'It's too fucking windy here - can you do something about it?' </p> <p>Which is not to say he didn't have a great time too, meeting his heroes. He met Brian Wilson when the Beach Boy had taken to playing his piano in a sandpit in the dining room and listened to 'Good Vibrations' until 4am ('I was simultaneously terrified and in awe of this brilliant man, who is probably the biggest influence on my songwriting'); he got an autograph from Elvis, though he feels cheated as the king was bloated and 'too gone'; he met an 'eccentric' Bob Dylan. </p> <p>In 1973, he spent a lot of time with John Lennon. 'I remember being in a room at the Sherry Netherlands hotel with John and we were both on coke. At 3am there was a knock on the door and we looked through the peephole; it was Andy Warhol. We both stood there, paranoid, whispering: don't let him in!' </p> <p>On 29 July 1990, at the age of 43, Elton John got clean. After months in rehab and therapy, he stopped relying on the drugs and alcohol. By way of distraction, he started to collect photography. Not just the odd photo, naturally, but enough to fill a gallery. In the early Nineties he paid \u00a3120,000 for Man Ray's Tears, then a world record for a photo. He bought an apartment in Atlanta - the only city in the world, he says, where he can live a relatively normal life - and filled it with pieces by contemporary photographers. </p> <p>He didn't lose his sense of fun - he tells some funny stories about his relationship with Rod Stewart, one that has endured since the early Seventies and that has been defined by practical jokes and wind-ups. 'I bought him a Zimmer frame for his 50th birthday and he sent me one of those old-fashioned ladies' hairdryers you sit underneath with the message: \"The only thing I forgot to buy was the hair to go with it.\" It's like a Joan Crawford/Bette Davis relationship. Rod's never lost his vicious British humour, and that's why I adore him.' </p> <p>On 30 October 1993, Elton John fell in love. He'd been on the road for a long time and wanted to meet new people; he had a dinner party at Woodside, the house in Windsor, and David Furnish was one of the guests. Furnish had been a fan - Caribou was the first album he ever bought - and was shy but nonetheless gave Elton his number. 'I knew he was going off to a Halloween party and I always get up very early ... I was trying to work out the earliest I could ring on a Sunday morning.' </p> <p>He laughs. 'At 11am I plucked up the courage to make the call. We had dinner in London that night and talked some more. David was the first person I'd been with who had his own apartment, his own job at Ogilvy and Mather, his own circle of friends. He also wasn't afraid to tell me what he thought.' </p> <p>Elton liked being told he was wrong. He liked being chastised for spending too much money; it was refreshing for him after so many one-sided relationships in which he'd taken control.'I was so relieved that David was willing to challenge me when I lost it. He knew how to handle me and it wasn't with kid gloves.' </p> <p>There is a song for David on Peachtree Road. 'My Elusive Drug' is a touching, bluesy tribute to Elton's lover, written by Bernie Taupin but sung with aching tenderness. Once again, it seems as though Taupin has been telepathic. Elton laughs. 'I might be wrong because Bernie never tells me but that song screams of the fact that I've been through everything, I've tried everything and finally I've found my elusive drug - David. It's a very special song; the Nina Simone song on the album.' </p> <p>Elton John grins. 'It's been 14 years since I got sober. I've got a new album, a great private life, and at 57 I feel excited by life.' </p> <p>As it's such a gorgeous afternoon, we take a walk around Elton's extensive gardens. The dog is over-excited, darting around the Italian garden Elton's late friend Gianni Versace encouraged him to create. He says the past 12 months have been the most creative of his life; not just a new album, but Billy Elliot the Musical (he has written the music to the stage production of the Stephen Daldry film, which premieres this autumn in Newcastle), a Broadway production of The Vampire Lestat (based on the first two Anne Rice novels) and the soundtrack to an animated Disney film called Gnomeo and Juliet. </p> <p>Then there are the concerts. Alongside his never-ending world tours, Elton is in residency in Las Vegas for the next three years, playing a total of 75 shows, in a lavish production designed by David LaChapelle. But he never forsakes the serious for the superficial; his commitment as chairman of the Elton John Aids Foundation is as great as ever, while he also supports breast cancer charities. 'I go out and raise the money; I am the whore,' he says. 'But I don't scream about it all the time.' </p> <p>Elton becomes serious for a moment as he contemplates his 60th birthday. 'There will come a time when my lifestyle has to change. Why I'm still trying to prove something to myself, I don't know. I have a lovely private life with David but we don't spend enough time together.' </p> <p>He pauses, squinting. 'I'm not going to be like the Who and do a farewell tour for the next 15 years, but I am finding it harder, emotionally, to stay on the road.' </p> <p>He looks across the stunning gardens to the house he bought in 1975 in a drugs haze. 'This is home for me. It's where David and I first met. But we don't need the stuff; I'd be happy living in a Winnebago with David because I love him so much.' His eyes are watering. Maybe it's the sun. </p> <p>'I always wanted to buy a big fucking retirement home and live in it with all my friends. An old department store in the King's Road would be perfect. I could run the CD shop, Neil Tennant the bookshop and Sam Taylor-Wood the art shop.' He rubs the dog's head. 'Either that or buy a big chateau in France and just walk around in kaftans eating donuts all day.'</p> <p><strong>The fan club</strong></p> <p><strong> Sam Taylor-Wood:</strong> </p> <p><strong> What's your favourite song of his?</strong><br>'Tiny Dancer'.<br><strong> What makes Elton a living legend?</strong><br>The way he never sits still and endlessly pushes his limits to become what he is.<br><strong> How do you think he will be remembered?</strong><br>Aside from all his amazing achievements ... flowers.<br><strong> What's it like having him as a friend?</strong><br>He's more than a friend; he's my gay husband. </p> <p><strong> Elton on Sam Taylor-Wood:</strong><br>If I wasn't with David, I would love to be with Sam. She's become such an inspiration for me. There isn't a day I don't call her. I love her and Jay [Jopling, Sam's husband] so much. And their daughter, Angelica. I trust her for advice but I also just love her as a person: she's one of the greatest people I've ever met. I would do anything for her. And creatively, she's amazing. She's so full of ideas.</p> <p><strong> Rod Stewart</strong></p> <p><strong>OMM: What's your favourite Elton song?</strong> 'Maggie May'<br><strong> How will he be remembered? </strong> Not only for his music, but his great charity work and also his tremendous sense of humour. He should have been a stand-up comic. He is the funniest man I have ever met.<br><strong> What is he like as a friend?</strong> He's more like a sister.<br> <strong> You've known each other for decades now: what is so special about him?</strong> We have our ups and downs and we don't see each other like we used to in the Seventies. But he is so special, probably because of his unique talent. It's the same reason he's a legend. He is a great singer too, but not quite as good as me. <br><strong> How would you characterise your relationship?</strong><br>Deep mutual respect. Although we can be a little bitchy towards each other, especially me because he has sold more records than I have. But I love him. I almost wish I was gay.<br><strong> How has he changed over the years, musically and personally? </strong> He hasn't changed that much, musically. He is still as excellent as always, but he has broadened his horizons.<br><strong> Is he more talented than you?</strong><br>Yes, always has been and always will be. [smirks] </p> <p><strong> Rufus Wainwright:</strong> </p> <p><strong> OMM: What makes Elton a living legend?</strong><br>His ability to maintain an incredible amount of energy and not become disillusioned with the whole showbusiness thing. Couple that with his incredible chameleon-like talent.<br><strong> What's your favourite song of his? </strong> 'Yellow Brick Road', because I've been on both ends of that equation.<br><strong> How will he be remembered?</strong><br>As a devilish saint who basically sleeps, wakes, eats and shits music.<br><strong> What's it like having him as a friend </strong> It's wonderful, and I wouldn't trade it for all the tea in China. </p> <p><strong> Elvis Costello:</strong> </p> <p><strong> OMM: What makes Elton special?</strong><br>His joy, his knowledge of the musical past, and an impressive curiosity for new music; he knows much more about new releases than many more self-consciously hip artists.<br> <strong> What's your favourite song of his?</strong><br>It changes all the time. One of the more well-known titles would be 'Sorry ...' I heard Ray Charles do it two years ago and it knocked everyone out and made me want to sing it myself. 'Tiny Dancer' has an amazing stucture, too, and a great lift to the chorus. These songs are hard! There are a couple of melodies on the new record which are up there with his best, particularly 'My Elusive Drug' and 'Turn the Lights Out'. Full of unexpected changes. I also love some of those delicate songs from way back, such as 'Come Down in Time' or 'Sixty Years On'... <br><strong> What is he like as a friend?</strong> <br>Elton (and David) have been very loving friends to my wife in the past few years; we have no words to describe their kindness to us as a couple. It is amazing that anyone who works so hard could find time to check in on friends not doing so well or simply to be so gracious, courteous and wickedly humoured. This life often makes people much more selfish. </p> <p><strong> Graham Taylor</strong> </p> <p><strong> What makes Elton a living legend?</strong><br>The man is so talented as a professional musician - forget the pop star stuff. You don't stay at the top of that profession without working at it. He applies his talent to his job better than anyone I have met.<br><strong> What's your favourite song of his?</strong><br>'Candle in the Wind' is my favourite - it has been ever since it first came out - but 'I'm Still Standing' is strangely appropriate for both Elton and myself!<br><strong> How will he be remembered?</strong><br>As a great musical talent and a wonderful showman <br><strong> What is he like as a friend?</strong><br>I count myself as very fortunate to have been a part of Elton's life.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>To raise funds for the Elton John Aids Foundation, Elton and Sam Taylor-Wood have given us a signed print of our cover photograph to auction.<br>If you would like to bid for the photograph simply send us a letter stating how much you would be willing to pay, with full contacts details including your phone number.

  "<p>Young, single, with money in your pocket and your whole life ahead of you, your twenties are often billed as the most fun you are likely to have. But there is a creeping sense of malaise among graduate workers in their mid to late twenties, recognised by some as the 'quarter-life crisis'. </p> <p>The phenomenon is often characterised by anxiety, self-doubt and a sense of inferiority as individuals find themselves craving much more than a secure salary and a good enough job - they want a career capable of satisfying their deep-seated talents and need for ongoing stimulation. The quarter-life crisis is also typified by the sense that true happiness would be attainable if only you knew what you were meant to be doing with your life. </p> <p>Damian Barr, author of Get It Together: Surviving Your Quarterlife Crisis, says: 'There are two components to the quarter-life crisis: feeling as if you should be doing and having more in what's supposed to be most exciting decade of your life; and a reality which often fails to match up.' </p> <p>Barr interviewed about 200 twentysomethings for his book and identified attitudes to work as a key source of much of the anxiety. </p> <p>He says: 'How good our job is has become our lives, so if things are going wrong at work, we feel as if everything is wrong with our life. Those experiencing a quarter-life crisis might also want a great job, as well as a brilliant flat and a cast of great friends and if they don't have all this before they hit 30 they feel a failure.' </p> <p>While less sympathetic observers might feel all this sounds like bellyaching by workers lucky enough to be overwhelmed by life choices, it is something many employers take seriously. </p> <p>Jessica Jarvis, a learning, training and development adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says: 'Many employers now recognise the high expectations of young people entering the workplace as a huge challenge. People these days have much higher demands of what they want from a job; they are looking for meaning, satisfaction and happiness.' </p> <p>Jatinder Takhar, a 27-year-old psychology graduate from London, is typical of this sort of challenge to employers: 'I was 24 and pretty down. I had managed to get a fairly well-paid job in advertising, but all I could see was the rest of my life in an office stretching out in front of me. I wanted to be stimulated and excited by my career, but I hadn't a clue what kind of job would provide this.' </p> <p>In common with many of his contemporaries, Takhar's sense of post-graduation anxiety was compounded by student debt and the growing realisation that he would be forced into paying rent for some time, as rising house prices put purchasing his first home out of reach. However, Barr's research indicates that winning a high-paying job can often be a red herring for young workers striving for satisfying lives: 'Time and again I would hear interviewees say the more they earnt, the more they would spend and they were still unsatisfied. Coming through a quarter-life crisis can hinge on defining success on a personal level, not in terms of money.' This might mean ignoring the background noise among your peers on salary and galloping up the career ladder, focusing instead on what really drives you. </p> <p>'I always had an idea I might not earn as much as some of my friends, but it never really bothered me,' says Richard Carver, a 28-year-old from Manchester who has found his twenties relatively untroubled by angst. Richard took time out after graduating from Newcastle University before taking a job as a long-haul flight attendant, which he did for five years. </p> <p>'I knew after about three years that I was getting ready to make a career decision. I'd always been passionate about food and began to realise that I wanted to turn my hobby into a career.' </p> <p>Sally Russell, principal consultant at consultancy firm RightCoutts, says that when you start to question whether your job is really what you want to be doing with your life, it is time to get back to basics and re-estab lish what drives and inspires you: 'Move away from thinking about your options in reference to the skills you already have and focus instead on what you find genuinely interesting.' </p> <p>Carver is now training to be a chef and, while money can be tight compared to his flying days, he says he has no regrets and is happy to be pursuing his vocation. </p> <p>His example highlights a further survival strategy for achieving a happy work life - not making knee-jerk decisions. </p> <p>Jarvis warns: 'Our research indicates that if you move jobs a lot in a short space of time, then around a quarter of employers could be less likely to give you a job.' </p> <p>She strongly recommends not jumping ship without speaking to your employer about alternatives within the company. </p> <p>Dr Maria Yapp, managing director at business psychologists Xancam Consulting, agrees: 'Nowadays, increasing numbers of employers are willing to allow their employees to leave the workplace, either to go on sabbatical or secondments.' </p> <p>Yapp says there has been a sea-change in the way some employers view their staff: 'Many no longer see their people as assets, but as investors. Employees have a choice about how much of their time, talent and energy they are willing to invest. More enlightened employers are using this to ensure that the return on this investment is achieved for both the company and the individual.' </p> <p>In practice, this can mean being given the opportunity to have frank discussions about how you feel about your role and to enjoy greater flexibility from bosses. Barr makes the point that many twentysomethings dream of swapping commuting for travelling. For some it can prove a way of clearing the mind to make a significant career decision. </p> <p>Jatinder Takhar left his advertising job to go on a round-the-world trip about three years ago. He returned to a job back in the sector, but with a different attitude: 'I realised it did not have to be for the rest of my life and gave myself a target of a year before making the next move. Travelling gave me the time to think about what I really enjoyed.' He had long hankered after a career in screenwriting and used the year that followed to get some money in the bank while completing a series of screenwriting evening courses at Central Saint Martins College in London. </p> <p>He recently won a place to study an MA in scriptwriting: 'Returning to part-time study is going to be a financial struggle,' he says. The payback is I'm entering into something that deep down I wanted to do for a long time .' </p> <p>Should you, or someone you know, be touched by a creeping sense of dissatisfaction in their twenties, Yapp's top tips include staying calm: 'Put your situation in context: you still have about 35 years left of your working life to find your true calling.' Barr simply says: 'If you don't have everything you want before you turn 30, you are not alone and it doesn't make you a loser.' </p> <p><strong>Don't panic: you've got 30 years to sort things out</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Try not to measure how successful you are by using the jobs and salaries of your contemporaries. Decide what is important to you and define your success in terms of these personal benchmarks. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Try to avoid making rash decisions that mean you stumble in and out of jobs in rapid succession.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Consider asking your employer about time out, sabbaticals or giving you leave for voluntary projects.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Do not be afraid to ask your employer for advice and training and other opportunities within the organisation.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you are unhappy because you don't feel that you are fulfilling your potential or because you feel you've made a bad work choice, remember, you probably have more than 30 years in the workplace to sort it out, so don't panic.</p>",
  "British doctors help nearly 20,000 people a year to die, according to one of the UK's leading authorities on euthanasia. The claim, the first public attempt by a credible expert to put a figure on 'assisted dying' rates, will reignite the emotive debate over the practice. <p>Dr Hazel Biggs, director of medical law at the University of Kent and author of Euthanasia: Death with Dignity and the Law, calculates that at least 18,000 people a year are helped to die by doctors who are treating them for terminal illnesses. </p> <p>Biggs, who has submitted evidence to the House of Lords select committee which is examining Lord Joffe's private member's bill on Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill, makes the claim in an article submitted to the European Journal for Health Law . </p> <p>Her figures will place renewed focus on the doctor-patient relationship, which pro-euthanasia campaigners want changed so that medical staff can help conscious, terminally ill patients in pain to shorten their lives. </p> <p>Biggs's figures are based on data from countries such as the Netherlands and Australia, which have published research into assisted dying rates, as well as evidence taken from British doctors. </p> <p>'If you extrapolate from countries that have published data, you're looking at quite a large number of patients who may have had their end hastened, not necessarily with their consent,' she said. </p> <p>'What this says to me is that we know these practices are going on, but they are completely unregulated. We don't know how many people are volunteers or non-volunteers, and maybe because of that the law ought to be changed so that people can give voluntary consent, which will give them more protection.' </p> <p>An ageing population has meant that an increasing number of doctors are taking private decisions to aid the early demise of terminally ill patients, usually by increasing drug doses. </p> <p>Deborah Annetts, chief executive of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, said there was an urgent need to clarify regulations governing assisted dying: 'We need to shine a spotlight on this. The medical profession doesn't want the public to realise they are making these decisions. It shows the need to make the patient the decision-maker. When it's left to the doctor, there is always the risk of abuse.' </p> <p>Pro-euthansia groups point out that in Britain the maximum sentence for helping someone to commit suicide is 14 years in prison. 'With the exception of Ireland, no other country in Europe behaves like that,' Annetts said. </p> <p>Opinion polls show overwhelming public support for law changes that would make it easier for terminally ill patients in pain to request medical help to shorten their lives. In successive surveys, about 80 per cent of people back the move. A survey by the society this month found that 47 per cent of people said they were prepared to help a loved one to die, even if it meant breaking the law. </p> <p>But a spokeswoman for the ProLife party said: 'Surely the response of a compassionate society is to alleviate the pain, to love and comfort the patient, and to try and restore a sense of self-worth until death comes naturally.' </p> <p>Politicians have repeatedly deflected moves to change the law on euthanasia, believing it is unlikely to be a vote-winner. But Joffe's bill might find its way through the Lords committee stage and into the Commons, which would alarm religious groups. </p> <p>In a joint submission to the select committee, Church of England and Roman Catholic bishops said: 'It is deeply misguided to propose a law by which it would be legal for terminally ill people to be killed or assisted in suicide by those caring for them, even if there are safeguards to ensure that only the terminally ill would qualify.'</p>",
  "<p>'House slip' screamed the Sun. 'Homes in Price Drop' yelled the Mirror. Even the Times chipped in with 'House prices suffer biggest fall since 2000'. </p> <p>If the headlines are to be believed, we are already caught up in a house-price crash. Two of Britain's best-known economists turned the national preoccupation with house prices into theatre last week with a public debate on the subject. Roger Bootle, of Capital Economics, known for his conviction that prices are set to fall dramatically, was challenged to defend his theory by Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research, who believes that we can live comfortably with property prices at higher levels than in the past. </p> <p>As the economists were expounding their theories, Cash canvassed the market to find out what is really going on as homeowners, buyers and estate agents prepare for the pre-Christmas marketing season. Our research suggests that, for now at least, Congdon's view has the edge. </p> <p><strong> Whither house prices?</strong></p> <p> Yes, the rate of increase in prices has slowed down, but, with the exception of London and a few other limited areas, it has not stopped or gone into reverse. Nick Freeth, area managing director for Bradford &amp; Bingley Estate Agents in the Wessex region, says: 'Prices aren't moving forward significantly, but they are not moving backwards either. Prices have settled and I would expect them to remain so.' </p> <p>The story is the same in East Anglia. Max Sowerby of the Sowerbys estate agency chain on the north Norfolk coast thinks that prices could remain stable for as long as three years. 'Our prices went stable nine to 10 months ago. If properties had continued increasing at the rate they were, we would be looking for a downturn now.' </p> <p>Prices at the top end of the London market - homes costing \u00a31 million-plus - were hit last year by the lack of international buyers and a dearth of bonuses paid to City workers. </p> <p>Liam Bailey, head of residential research for Knight Frank, says that prices in this sector fell by an average of 2 per cent, while Kensington was particularly badly affected, falling by 7.3 per cent. But prices regained an average 3.7 per cent in the first six months of the year and have now stabilised. Upmarket country properties were even worse-hit, falling by about 10 per cent in value last year. </p> <p>But Bailey says: 'This type of purchase is aspirational, and can always be put off to another year when the bonuses start coming in again. The majority of that decline was recouped in the first six months of this year, but the market has slowed considerably over the summer.' </p> <p>The slowdown has even reached the north, usually the last area to be affected. Jane Pridgeon, managing director of Halifax Estate Agents, says: 'The market has followed the traditional pattern. What started in London and the south east has been quickly followed by the Midlands and the north.' </p> <p><strong> Should you be scared?</strong></p> <p> Homeowners should not read anything sinister into the speed and spread of the slowdown, however. Milan Khatri, chief economist at the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, says: 'There's been quite an abrupt slowdown over the past three or four months, but interest rates have risen sharply. Although they are still low, they have actually gone up by a third, so it's bound to have an impact.' </p> <p>Khatri thinks house prices would have slowed down without the intervention of rate rises by the end of the year simply because house- price inflation was far exceeding that of wages. But other factors that have contributed to price crashes in the past - high interest rates, the removal of tax breaks and, most importantly, high unemployment - are not a problem today. </p> <p>Most homeowners have reacted calmly to the news. Estate agents report that the flow of new stock onto the market is steady, ironically because people who are thinking about selling now feel it's safe. The amount they can ask for their current home will not be diminished by galloping inflation while they are looking for a new one. </p> <p>Pridgeon says: 'In 2003, new houses coming on to the market started to drop off significantly from March. It picked up a little in September, but not enough. The shortage caused house price inflation. Sellers were frightened they wouldn't find a house to buy, and that by the time they did it would cost too much. </p> <p>'But in 2004 new houses have been coming on to the market pretty constantly. Customers are telling us that they now feel more confident about putting [their homes] on the market because prices have stabilised and there's a good choice for them to look at.' </p> <p><strong> The landlord effect</strong></p> <p> Some property pundits have speculated that a crash could be sparked off by amateur landlords becoming disenchanted with the hassle and cost of running their investments and putting them up for sale. </p> <p>However Rics' Khatri says that although some buy-to-let landlords have sold up in Yorkshire, Humberside and Wales, there is no evidence of this happening elsewhere. And even if landlords decided en masse to retire from the business, the proportion of property they own is so small it would have 'very little impact on supply'. </p> <p><strong> What can you expect to sell for?</strong></p> <p> Provided both agents and sellers are realistic about the prices they ask for their homes, they will find a seller, says Tim Wright of Knight Frank's Kensington branch. </p> <p>He says that some of the 'price falls' highlighted in recent newspaper articles are actually sellers readjusting their asking prices after failing to sell their homes over the summer. </p> <p>He explains that people who put their homes on the market in the spring set high prices because they expected inflation to increase the value of their properties while they were being sold. But the rise in interest rates and the Bank of England's pessimism about property prices caused inflation to stall, leaving the asking prices looking expensive. </p> <p>Wright recommends that prospective sellers check out prices of similar properties in their area in local newspapers and estate agency windows. Then invite three agents round to provide valuations and select the one that comes up with a sensible price in line with other properties on the market. </p> <p>Buyers were 'gung-ho' last year, prepared to take part in bidding auctions and to pay above the odds, confident that the value of their new home would soon catch up with the price they paid for it. </p> <p>But this autumn they are much more cautious - and determined to negotiate a competitive deal. </p> <p>Caroline Bell, director of the Putney office of FPD Savills says: 'If they are renting or haven't got a property to sell, they do seem to think they have an automatic right to a discount. They're looking for up to 20 per cent off the asking price in some cases. They're not getting away with it, but it's quite frustrating.' </p> <p>If you're a buyer it's worth trying for a discount, but bear in mind that sellers are setting prices at more realistic levels.</p> <p><strong>Confused? You should be</strong></p> <p>House prices were both speeding up and slowing down, according to figures released last week. </p> <p>On Monday, data from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) recorded a 2.1 per cent rise in house prices in July, compared with 1.7 per cent in June.</p> <p>By Wednesday, however, the market was falling, with the National Association of Estate Agents (NAEA) reporting that the average property price had fallen for the third consecutive month in August. August figures from Halifax and Nationwide show a slowdown, with Halifax showing a 0.6 per cent fall in prices and Nationwide a 0.1 per cent gain month on month (compared with 2.1 per cent the previous month).</p> <p>The ODPM gets the data for its index from all the lenders, so is likely to show a slowing down or fall for August when it eventually publishes its figures later this autumn. But how come the NAEA results showed a fall in June and July, when the ODPM, Nationwide and Halifax indices were still positive? 'The NAEA is based on asking prices,' says a spokeswoman, 'whereas the Nationwide, Halifax and ODPM are based on valuations. This means the NAEA results are more up-to-date: they reflect what is happening in the estate agency that month, whereas the valuation-based indices show what was happening several months previously.'</p> <p><strong>Yours for \u00a3350,000 less</strong></p> <p>The former head of one of Britain's biggest estate agency chains has had to reduce the asking price on his London apartment by \u00a3350,000. </p> <p>Christopher Rodrigues, who resigned as chief executive of Bradford and Bingley earlier this year to take up top position at Visa in the US, has been trying to sell a five-bedroom penthouse flat overlooking Holland Park since March without any success. He decided to cut the \u00a32.85 million asking price by 12 per cent at the end of August and immediately attracted interest from potential buyers.</p> <p>'We spoke to a number of estate agents at the beginning of the year about where the market was,' he says. 'They were fairly closely packed about the same price, with outriders 20 per cent above and below. We agreed to go with the price in the middle of the range -\u00a32.85m.' At this level, he and his wife would have been prepared to negotiate bids below the asking price.</p> <p>Given the renewed interest in the property, he would not be surprised to reach the same price he was hoping for before, even from the lower asking price.</p> <p>'As it transpires, the market did flatten and if you want to be attractive you have to be fairly price-sensitive.'</p> <p>The 3,200 sq ft apartment includes a large drawing room, dining room, three bathrooms and full-size artist's studio with 17-ft north-facing skylight (his wife is an artist). The property comes with a 998- year lease and share of the freehold.</p> <p>The couple have decided not to buy in the US, as they regard the UK as their ultimate home.</p> <p>Instead they are renting an apartment overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. So does his selling the Kensington apartment indicate that he thinks now is the time to get out of the UK property market?</p> <p>'We were a bit long on London property - we have an apartment in West End Quay near Paddington as well, and now that the children have grown up we don't need all those bedrooms.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For further information about the apartment, call Knight Frank on 020 7938 4311.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The following apology was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday September 26 2004</strong></p> <p>In our review below of How We Can Save The Planet, we stated that the book's proposal for per capita carbon rationing would result in 'compounding fundamental inequalities between developed and developing countries'. The reverse is true. Its application would shrink the gap between rich and poor countries: those unable to manage within their shares would have to buy the unused parts of the allocations of those able to do so.</p> <p></p> <p><strong> How We Can Save the Planet</strong> <br> <strong> by Mayer Hillman</strong> <br> Penguin \u00a37.99, pp195 </p> <p> This ecological manifesto practises what it preaches: its cover is printed on the same natural, recyclable paper as the pages inside. The first and second sections of the book present the facts about climate change and highlight the ineffectual nature of the global measures taken in response, such as the Kyoto Protocol. The third presents the author's own radical solution to the problem: carbon rationing. Hillman was one of the first proponents of carbon rationing on a global and individual basis as the only realistic way to prevent serious damage from climate change. He insists his solution is based on equitable principles, although he fails to acknowledge its potential to compound fundamental inequalities between 'developed' and 'developing' countries: environmental issues must be considered in relation to the broader context of international development. Hillman's political thinking might be disputable, but he provides vital, practical information to help individuals adopt an energy-thrifty lifestyle. </p> <p><strong> The Curious Life Of Robert Hooke</strong> <br> <strong>by Lisa Jardine</strong> <br> HarperCollins \u00a38.99, pp422 </p> <p> Robert Hooke is perhaps best remembered as the 'man of strange unsociable temper' who claimed to have discovered the Law of Gravity before Sir Isaac Newton. Newton's refusal to make any acknowledgement to Hooke in his Principia Mathematica sparked a fierce and very public row, which resulted in Newton destroying the portrait of Hooke that hung in the Royal Society. Lisa Jardine, who claims to have discovered another portrait of Hooke in the Natural History Museum, presents a prose picture of lively and intricate detail. As well as Newton's sworn enemy, Hooke was a close friend of Sir Christopher Wren, with whom he worked tirelessly to rebuild London after the Great Fire of 1666. A prolific inventor and opium addict, Hooke emerges as a curious figure in both senses of the word. This engaging biography retrieves the man, his genius, and the status he deserves as 'a founding figure in the European scientific revolution.' </p> <p> <strong> The Last Good Time</strong> <br> <strong>by Jonathan Van Meter</strong> <br> Bloomsbury \u00a38.99, pp296 </p> <p> Do we really need another book about the Rat Pack? Shawn Levy has already documented their whisky-soaked glory days in Rat Pack Confidential. The Last Good Time revisits the seedy nexus of celebrities, politicians and gangsters, but with less panache. This is due partly to Jonathan Van Meter's slack prose style and partly to his choice of subject. Van Meter claims that Paul 'Skinny' D'Amato, owner of the 500 Club in Atlantic City, was 'one of the most quietly influential figures of the 20th century'. It is never really clear what this extravagant claim is based upon. Skinny's list of accomplishments is short and dubious. He might have played a peripheral role in JFK's 1960 presidential campaign (Van Meter never attempts to verify the facts); he was certainly responsible for pairing the mediocre talents of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis at the 500 Club. And he taught Frank Sinatra the coolest way to hold a cigarette. Do we even care any more?</p>",
  "In spite of what has been said, declared or, in most cases, shouted, the bill banning hunting with dogs is not really about cruelty to animals. Still less is it striking a blow against the class system. It is about the final triumph of town over country. It is about the contempt that urban Britain has for rural Britain. <p>Today, 81 per cent of the British population live in metropolitan areas. Those who were born in cities, became rich in cities, decided to stay there - except at weekends. There simply isn't enough money in farming, or any part of the rural economy, to make it worth their while buying anything other than a weekend retreat. </p> <p>These new, part-time country folk do not buy into rural social structures, activities or principles. They bring with them their urban habits, their urban pastimes, their urban values. They complain about sheep on the road, smells in the air and the sound of church bells ringing on Sunday morning. </p> <p>And they are only a minority. The vast majority of city dwellers have hardly anything to do with the countryside, visiting it as they would the hinterland of Spain, Greece or Italy when they can't visit Spain, Greece or Italy, viewing it as tourists, with curiosity but no understanding. </p> <p>The depth of that misunderstanding has been revealed by several columnists commenting on this brouhaha, who have equated those who live in the country with the moneyed, land-owning class or their forelock-tugging dependents, as if all people who did not live as they did conform to the stereotypes which suit their argument. And, of course, economics as well as history are on their side. Agriculture only contributes 1.7 per cent to GDP, businesses located in the countryside even less. </p> <p>Financial and political power reside in the cities. The fact is that rural Britain doesn't matter politically or socially any more. The sense of marginalisation and estrangement of the rural underclass, which is defined not by income or social back ground, but by where they live and work, has bred anger and despair. They sense viscerally the contempt and triumphalism of the urban mass overclass. </p> <p>No other topic brings out this divide more clearly than the debate on hunting with dogs, nor illustrates the hypocrisy of public attitudes to animal welfare. Fox hunting seems to elicit a degree of sanctimony, humbug and sophistry unparalleled in modern politics. Even the most committed anti-hunting commentators admit that, in terms of animal cruelty, fox hunting rates low on the list of atrocities we allow to be routinely inflicted on various animal, bird and piscine species. Somehow the fox elicits tender feelings in the breasts of politicians and the urban majority that they deny chickens, pigs, cows and salmon. </p> <p>There is no denying fox hunting is cruel, and that it is done largely for pleasure, but is there any moral difference between consciously inflicting cruelty for pleasure or consciously inflicting it for profit? </p> <p>The scale of cruelty, its intensity and constancy that society tolerates on creatures bred in the name of the consumer far outweighs anything done in the name of sport to the fox. The truth is that, as an urban society, we no longer care about the provenance of our food, as long as it comes in sufficient quantities and at low enough prices. Urbanisation has led to us being separated from the food chain. We don't really want to know more about the mucky business of looking after living beasts or converting the living ones to the dead ones. We are happy to find animals reduced to indefinable lumps of protein trimmed, neat and tidy, beneath their shiny clingfilm armour. </p> <p>The process of urbanisation inevitably goes hand in hand with increasing institutional control. Cities depend on highly geared co-operation. Without it, they would disintegrate into chaos. However, this can only be achieved by institutional, usually state, control. Little by little, urbanites have ceded freedom and responsibilities to the state in exchange for rigorously regulated harmony. </p> <p>Except in carefully defined areas, city life is defined by the absence of freedoms, independence and responsibility. This underlying principle is now being foisted on rural Britain.</p>",
  "<p>It seems only right that Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9 has invited me to the Wolseley, one of London's hottest new restaurants, to discuss The Desk, the new BBC4 media programme he is fronting from next January. Br\u00fbl\u00e9 will be forever be known as the founder of Wallpaper*, the unapologetically aspirational interiors magazine about 'the stuff that surrounds you', so this feels like his natural habitat.</p> <p>Self-proclaimed style gurus always invite sartorial scrutiny and it is impossible to resist the temptation to analyse Br\u00fbl\u00e9's appearance (for the record, he is immaculately turned out, in a blue jacket, charcoal grey V-neck, slightly faded jeans and pale blue shirt.) The Desk will be subject to a similar level of scrutiny from the back-biting media world, which greeted with surprise the news that Br\u00fbl\u00e9's 'multi-disciplined creative agency' Wink and producer Anne Reevell - who launched Radio 4's media show Medium Wave - had been commissioned to produce The Desk. </p> <p>A host of well-established media commentators and TV presenters pitched for the coveted 30-programme run, including Paul Merton, Kirsty Wark, and former Times media editor Ray Snoddy. Br\u00fbl\u00e9 concedes that he was surprised to land the show so soon after renewing his acquaintance with Reevell, whom he first met when he was a young freelance reporter and occasional Medium Wave contributor. </p> <p>'We hooked up again to work on a concept for a smart, more euro-centric morning news show for one of the terrestrials and the BBC4 request came up during that process', he says, adding that he is prepared for the inevitable sniping about style triumphing over substance. </p> <p>'It's the nature of the business. People have trouble coming to grips with the fact that you can actually move quite easily between a TV newsroom floor to Kabul's backstreets to the editor's chair of a glossy magazine.' </p> <p>Br\u00fbl\u00e9 was shot in Afghanistan in 1994 while working as a freelance, and worked for a UK financial news channel, so he does not lack a serious side. </p> <p>He points out that Wallpaper* ran some ground-breaking articles, including 'the first piece on al-Jazeera', and his business track record is undeniably impressive. He sold Wallpaper* to AOL Time Warner for just over \u00a31 million in 1999 and went on to set up Wink to provide design, advertising, branding and marketing advice to clients including Marks and Spencer - it designed the infamous M&amp;S Lifestore in Gateshead - and Selfridges. He recently bought the business back from AOL Time Warner. </p> <p>Even so, The Desk's set is likely to be analysed as closely as its content. 'We're damned either way. If we don't have an incredible set people will ask why not, and if we do they will criticise us,' Br\u00fbl\u00e9 says, adding, lest there be any doubt, 'the sets will be fantastic'. </p> <p>He is unapologetic about his desire to create an appealing on-screen aesthetic. 'I want to take my print experience and apply it to the screen. Just as every page of a magazine is exquisitely crafted we want to bring the same attention to detail to The Desk. Contributors will not only be thoroughly briefed but also well groomed. There's nothing worse than showing up to do a TV show and the people in the control let guests on air with stained ties and bed head.' </p> <p>Given the media world's propensity for self-indulgent navel-gazing, it is remarkable that it has had to wait this long for a dedicated half-hour TV show. (The last one was Channel 4's Media Show, which disappeared from screens in 1991). But Br\u00fbl\u00e9 is determined to avoid aping the parochial outlook of many media pundits, whose pronouncement may interest guests at a north London dinner party but lack broader appeal. </p> <p>'The exciting thing about a BBC4 commission is that we can be quite highbrow and challenging [but] I don't want to use all the usual faces,' he says. ' The Desk should talk to both the core BBC4 viewer and the trade.' The programme will have a determinedly global perspective, hardly surprising since the Canadian-born Br\u00fbl\u00e9 moved to London at an early age, has a summer house in Sweden and lives for much of the year in Zurich. </p> <p>He talks of 'sending someone to San Francisco to cover Apple's financials ('as relevant to British viewers as it is to an American audience' ) and 'keeping an eye on what [iPod designer] Jonathan Ive is up to at the Apple design centre'. </p> <p>Overseas trends will be identified and analysed, he says, offering up a particularly pertinent example. 'The British trade press takes any launch as fresh and new and rarely reveals that many concepts have been lifted from overseas newsstands. The Desk should blow the whistle on these \"fresh, original\" launches when necessary. There's no reason we can't say \"OK this format is new to the UK newspaper market, but it has been around in Sweden for 10 years\".' </p> <p>There will be live satellite links to correspondents on the east coast of America and features on Brazil's new rolling 24-hours news services. 'When I took back the agency [Wink] I took a lot of Wallpaper*'s correspondents on retainers. We'll be using people in Sao Paulo, Beirut, Singapore, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Barcelona and New York to feed into our newsdesk.'</p> <p>Although Br\u00fbl\u00e9 made his reputation in magazines, he started in television, working as a reporter on Janet Street-Porter's youth-orientated current affairs programme Reportage in the late 1980s. Br\u00fbl\u00e9 believes London is now the world's leading media centre. 'When I first got here in 1989, I thought \"have I come to the wrong place?\" because everyone was travelling the other way. There was a time when you had to go to New York to make it in the media world.' But no more. 'London has overtaken New York, at least creatively. America's tough immigration policies make it more difficult to show up as a freelancer at JFK and hope they'll let you in to write or design.' </p> <p>The globalisation of the media marketplace has also benefited London, he says. 'London has become the international news hub. You have all the Arabic papers here, al-Jazeera is going to expand their operation, you have a big CNN production centre, all the US networks' main bureaux and most other foreign broadcasters make London their hub [to cover] Europe, Africa and the Middle East.'

The massive solidity of the Barbican's art gallery, characterised by battered concrete walls and heavy bronze staircases, shows Libeskind's designs in their best possible light. The translucent models seem to dance and flicker like delicate chandeliers or pieces of jewellery set against the rough sandpaper the exhibition designers have put on the floor. </p> <p>The crystalline geometry of the 16 New York-based Libeskind projects, built and unbuilt, on show are a promise of an architecture that is everything the Barbican is not. It is an architecture that is light on its feet, ethereal, impossible to pin down. Indeed, Libeskind spent time in Britain as a student, and his work can be seen as a deliberate reaction against the heaviness of the brutalism of the 1960s. </p> <p>The irrepressible Libeskind is himself equally determined not to be pinned down. He was named as America's first ever cultural ambassador for architecture at the Venice architecture Biennale last week. And he is already bringing a relentless optimism to the role. Other men would have been broken by the experience of the professional highs and lows represented by the Ground Zero rollercoaster, but not Libeskind. In less than two years he has gone from presenting his competition-winning design to rebuild the World Trade Centre live on CNN to suing the Twin Towers' developer, Larry Silver stein, for his fees. But he refuses to be rattled and keeps an equable composure about the steady marginalisation of his role. Stoutly maintaining that he will have his vision of the project realised in the end, he says that in five years' time 'the essential elements will be completed'. For Libeskind these are the reconnection of the Ground Zero site with the streets around it, the completion of what he calls the 'wedge of light plaza' - marking the shadows cast by the missing Twin Towers each 11 September, and the building of the Freedom Tower. </p> <p>In this exhibition you can see the early drawings that Libeskind made in the 1970s, when there seemed every likelihood that he would remain a paper architect for the rest of his days, scratchy black ink firework displays. Now he claims to have his feet planted firmly in the real world. The design for Ground Zero that made Libeskind briefly the most famous architect on the planet is in the midst of the display. It shows a cluster of towers arching around the 1,776ft Freedom Tower, designed to paraphrase the Statue of Liberty. </p> <p>All that is certain about this project is that the redeveloped site of the Twin Towers will bear little resemblance to Libeskind's elegant model. Libeskind won a competition staged by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation which does not fully control the site. It is the developer Larry Silverstein who leased the Twin Towers before they were destroyed who has the most direct influence on the project. And he has his own architect, David Childs from the huge corporate firm SOM working on the design. Childs and Libeskind have been at war ever since the competition; meanwhile Libeskind has embarked on a law suit against Silverstein to extract fees for his time working on the plan. </p> <p>Libeskind refuses to be downcast: 'Working in the marketplace is actually a better way of creating better buildings than relying on some all-powerful individual to wave a wand. For too long architects became prima donnas. I am all for demystifying architecture. Democracy does not produce mediocrity.' </p> <p>He is less upbeat about the Spiral, the V&amp;A's long-planned extension also in the show, which was rejected for funding by the heritage lottery fund for the second time in the summer, and finally cancelled by the museum's trustees last week. 'I am very disappointed that there is no funding for the Spiral. London deserves a space with a new idea of history and context, not expressive, decorative high tech. I have done my job, and done all that I could. I can't devote my life to the Spiral. I have so many other museums to do.' Libeskind can take comfort that one major project will go ahead. He recently won a competition to redevelop a huge site in the centre of Milan. He will be building a 40-storey tower, alongside similar structures by Zaha Hadid and the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. He is also building a large extension to a museum in Denver. </p> <p>Clearly Libeskind's practice will survive the frustrations of Ground Zero. What he may find tougher to withstand is the change in his critical reputation. </p> <p>Before Ground Zero, he was regarded as an intense and original thinker. Since a whirlwind of appearances on Oprah and articles in the New York Times about his snakeskin cowboy boots, he is seen as a populist. It's a variety of populism that has encouraged him to indulge his storytelling impulses to the full. </p> <p>The Jewish museum in Berlin, his first realised building, used its shape to tell the tragic story of the journey of Berlin's missing Jews. The Imperial War Museum in Manchester - shortlisted for next month's Stirling Prize - has another kind of narrative, based on the idea of the globe shattered by war and imperfectly reassembled. They are ideas that seem profound at first, but after too much retelling risk sounding glib. </p> <p>Libeskind's second British design, an academic building in London certainly shows the dangers of too much architectural storytelling. Libeskind was commissioned by the University of North London to design a graduate centre that would act as a landmark. And its tilting metal walls certainly draw attention to themselves. But Libeskind chose to overlay this spectacle with the suggestion that the building was based on the alignment of the Sirius constellation, pointing to the north star, and so a reflection of the University of North London. By the time the building was finished, the place had been renamed London Metropolitan University, leaving Libeskind's story looking a little redundant.</p>",
  "<p>Given the choice between visiting the doctor and going to the football, most blokes would head straight for the match. </p> <p>But now medical planners have come up with an ingenious plan to lure the game's male devotees into looking after themselves better: putting health centres into football grounds, beside the cafe, ticket office and superstore. </p> <p>The Premier League and the Department of Health are developing plans to exploit football's popularity among men to help them overcome their notorious reluctance to visit a doctor, even when they are ill. Stadiums, famous for their meat pies and half-time cups of Bovril, will become places where fans are encouraged to to seek treatment for obesity, heavy drinking or bowel cancer. </p> <p>Manchester City plan to open the first 'wellness centre' next spring at their City of Manchester Stadium. Staff will wear sportsgear rather than white coats and it will look more like a gym than a GP's surgery, in an attempt to make patients feel more comfortable. </p> <p>The centre will open from 10am-7pm on weekdays. Nurses, nutritionists and health educators will give advice on how to improve diet and avoid sexually transmitted diseases, as well as overcoming heart problems. </p> <p>Women will use it, too, and breast cancer screenings will start in November. But particular efforts will be made to attract men, whom experts say are the hardest to get positive health messages across to. Leaflets and posters of players encouraging men to take health seriously will be distributed among fans, and specific 'men's wellness days' will ask them to check themselves for signs of testicular cancer and recognise the warning signs of bowel cancer. </p> <p>'Siting a wellness centre in a stadium and having a top footballer saying to you, \"You should look after yourself; go and see a doctor and get that checked out,\" could be very useful,' said Pete Bradshaw, City's social responsibility manager. 'Hopefully that person will have a degree of credibility, among young men in particular, that people in white coats might not have.' </p> <p>Premier League spokesman Dan Johnson said: 'There's a natural synergy between football and the healthy living agenda. Groups in society who are often less inclined to access health facilities are heavily represented among crowds at matches, especially men and young people. It's tremendously encouraging what Manchester City are doing.' </p> <p>A number of clubs in the Premiership and Football League Championship are forming partnerships with local health authorities, which often have difficulty getting people in the poorer communities - in which many stadiums are located - to visit their GPs. Middlesbrough, for example, will this week launch a Fit For Work initiative, offering 60 long-term unemployed local men IT training and fitness sessions based on players' usual routines, with match tickets, free lunches and meetings with players as incentives to complete the 10-week course. The scheme is co-funded by the local primary care trust and employment agencies. </p> <p>Wolves are trying to restart a match-day drop-in health clinic at their Molineux ground. An average of 50 fans each home game sought advice from nurses on issues such as how to lose weight, until funding from the local health action zone ran out. </p> <p>The Merseyside club Everton are finalising the details of an extensive anti-obesity drive which they will start in primary schools in January. 'We'll try to get healthy living messages across to the pupils by pointing out that the footballers they admire usually don't smoke, drink a lot of water and eat a healthy diet, as a way of hope fully educating kids before they start bad habits like eating burgers,' said Dave Connor, of the club's community department. </p> <p>Everton will also launch a joint campaign with Barnardo's to promote sensible drinking. </p> <p>Clubs are planning to provide a growing number of health services as a way of repaying their fans' loyalty. This week, hundreds of fans had their blood pressure taken at testing stations at Newcastle United and Manchester City's stadiums, with some referred to their GP for treatment. </p> <p>And today a host of former players will lead mile-long 'healthy walks' around the pitch at clubs such as Manchester United and Liverpool, to encourage fans and locals to take regular exercise. </p> <p>'We are in talks with the Department of Health about how some of the health initiatives that some of our clubs already undertake individually could be extended nationally,' said the Premier League. 'The power of football can be very effective in engaging people to take their health more seriously.'</p>",
  "Debbie Purdy loves life. The 41-year-old from Bradford describes herself as an adrenaline junkie. In her time Purdy has jumped out of planes, climbed mountains, trekked through jungles and scuba-dived. These days her biggest buzz comes from walking unaided. <p>Purdy has suffered from chronic and progressive multiple sclerosis for a decade. 'I don't have relapses or remissions, I just get steadily worse,' she says breezily. </p> <p>Recently she started dropping things, something that has made her think about her life - and her death. 'At some point I know I will not be able to handle drugs and take an overdose. Before that happens, I've got to make a decision: should I end my life now? When the pain becomes unbearable and I've lost my dexterity completely, I won't be able to do it myself.' </p> <p>Purdy has every intention - and gives every indication - of being around for many years to come. But it is a question she urgently needs to address now so that she can concentrate on enjoying the rest of her life. 'I couldn't ask my husband to help me because there is the possibility that he would be jailed for it. It's going to be hard enough for him losing his wife - I couldn't ask him to risk being prosecuted.' </p> <p>Assisting suicides carries a maximum 14-year sentence in Britain, one of the few European countries where it is still a crime. Purdy, like her 55,000 fellow members of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, believes this is wrong. 'The only thing that will improve the quality of my life now is a change in the law, so I don't have to be thinking about what I'm going to have to do by myself. If that no longer becomes the biggest question in my life, then I can start thinking about overcoming the symptoms I cope with.' </p> <p>She considered going to Holland, where euthanasia for the terminally ill has been legalised. But patients need to have been registered with a Dutch doctor for two years before they qualify for medical assistance that would bring their lives to an end. </p> <p>Purdy's hopes for a law change look slim, at least for now. 'People want to bury their heads in the sand on this issue. The other day I heard Linford Christie say \"oh they could find a cure\". That's just grabbing at straws. That's denial.' </p> <p>She says she understands people's objections to euthanasia. 'In no way do I want to make it compulsory for someone to have to participate in assisted dying but, on the other hand, I don't have a moral or religious problem with it. It would improve my life and I don't want others to disrespect my opinion, either. </p> <p>'My doctor doesn't feel comfortable with euthanasia. Fair enough. But I should be able to find a doctor who does feel comfortable with it. It's the same with abortion. My doctor feels uncomfortable with abortion, but when someone is seeking an abortion they're allowed to ask for a doctor who is comfortable with it. We're just asking for the same rights. I don't want to plan my death. I want to enjoy my life.' </p> <p>It is a wish that is echoed by a growing number of people in the UK who want the right to make the decision about when and how their lives should end. </p> <p>Improvements in healthcare have created an ageing society, but with the consequence that more and more people are spending the last years of their lives in pain from crippling diseases. </p> <p>The government's solution has been to promise more money for palliative care. But pro-euthanasia groups believe this does not go far enough. They have criticised successive UK governments for failing to follow their European counterparts and investigate the argument for clarifying the law on assisted dying. </p> <p>The government's failure to do so is unsurprising. Death is rarely a vote winner and politicians are wary about antagonising the pro-life lobby, which has produced some powerful arguments against euthanasia. </p> <p>The Christian Medical Fellowship, for example, makes a persuasive case that people with a terminal illness are vulnerable because they worry about the burden they place on their family. Legalising assisted dying could increase this pressure, the CMF believes. </p> <p>But the government's reluctance to discuss euthanasia has confused an already complex area of law. The word has come to be a 'catch-all' term encompassing everything from mercy killings to doctors administering lethal drug doses to patients in a coma. </p> <p>'The problem has been to get the debate into the public forum, one that will allow people to be honest about their experiences,' acknowledges Deborah Annetts, chief executive of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society. </p> <p>Amid the lacuna, people have started to take the law into their own hands. The Switzerland-based group, Dignitas, claims to have helped 22 Britons with terminal illnesses die abroad. Hardly a month goes by now without a pensioner confessing to killing a partner who was in agonising pain. </p> <p>The CMF rejects the claim that euthanasia is a solution to patients' distress. 'Meticulous research in palliative medicine has in recent years shown that virtually all unpleasant symptoms experienced in the process of terminal illness can be either relieved or substantially alleviated by techniques already available,' it suggests. </p> <p>But this argument is rejected by many in the medical professions. Just over half of nurses questioned in 2003 said the law should be amended to allow health professionals to help terminally ill people die. </p> <p>In 1996, 54 per cent of 1,000 doctors questioned in a survey said they were in favour of legalising physician-assisted suicide in specific circumstances. The same survey found 3 per cent of GPs had helped terminally ill patients to die. That number is likely to have increased after several recent high-profile campaigns. The case of Diane Pretty, the woman with motor neurone disease who lost her high court fight to have her husband help end her life, attracted widespread media interest. </p> <p>Now, in the latest assault on the pro-life lobby, crossbench peer Lord Joffe is attempting to steer a private member's bill legalising assisted dying through the House of Lords. Under Joffe's proposals voluntary euthanasia would be made available to patients who have less than six months to live and who are in 'unbearable pain'. Their decision to hasten an end to their life would be accepted only after they had undergone psychiatric and medical examinations and had been given a 'cooling-off' period to allow them to change their mind. Tory peers vehemently oppose the bill which had attracted 100,000 submissions when its consultation process was completed earlier this month. </p> <p>Few think Joffe's bill will make it to law. But it may come to be seen as an important step towards legalised euthanasia in Britain. </p> <p>Evan Harris, Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, gave evidence to the committee in which he recalled seeing terminally ill patients pumped full of morphine to speed their demise when he was working as a doctor. Harris believes a change in the law is necessary to regulate a practice that clearly exists but remains hidden behind closed doors. </p> <p>'Doctors are always reluctant to see any change in the doctor-patient relationship, but I don't think they would oppose it if it became law. They accept it's a matter for society,' Harris says. </p> <p>Annetts believes the combination of an ageing population and an increasingly secular society will become a catalyst for change. </p> <p>'Ultimately the government will have to engage with this issue. The great thing about the euthanasia debate is we all have a view. We are all going to die.'</p>",
  "<p>Before Tim's problem with crack, I didn't know much about serious drug addiction. Only in EastEnders did I have contact with a serious addict, and that was with Nick Cotton, my 'son'! I had no idea Tim was on drugs until a friend, someone younger and more streetwise than me, told me her suspicions. I said: 'Are you sure? Oh, I don't think so', because one doesn't imagine this sort of thing is going to happen. I'd known Tim all his life - I'm his godmother - and he was a very straightforward, moral child. </p> <p>But looking back on that time now, there were signs that he had a drug problem. His skin wasn't very good, his teeth became discoloured and, of course, his nature changed. He became deceitful, because he was always lying, trying to get money to feed his habit. His mother, Polly, had to say to me: 'Don't give him any cash, June!' And I'd think: 'Oh dear, he hasn't got anything to buy a phone card or a coffee', and she'd say: 'Buy him the phone card, buy him food; just don't hand over your money.' </p> <p>I didn't see a great deal of Tim during this time because we lived in different parts of London, and EastEnders and my charity work are incredibly time-consuming. But, finally, his addiction came into the open. His mother was distraught- she was watching her child destroying himself, his character, his body. I was worried for Tim, too, because I recognise how difficult addiction is. It's like asking me to give up cigarettes. Well, I won't do it until I'm absolutely ready, and no one else can persuade me otherwise. </p> <p>A friend had seen a video on the Thamkrabok monastery and its drug detox program, and Polly and I felt it was the best chance for Tim because he'd always been a spiritual type of person. Anyway, rehabilitation in an English clinic couldn't be afforded. Plus, to be taken right out of your environment gives you a far better chance, I think. But you do have to really want to get off drugs and, by this stage, Tim did really want to. </p> <p>I paid for his airfare and the food - about \u00a3700 in all. The monks give vouchers for food, so Tim had no money to handle in the monastery. He was there for nearly a month in the end. I had great hope that Thamkrabok would help Tim and as soon as he came back to England after treatment, I knew immediately he'd changed. You could see it in him - he looked healthy again and he had a purpose. He was absolutely fascinated by the monks' music and immediately wanted to go back to the monastery because the monks had made him a recording studio to translate their music into more popular songs. He came up with this idea to make a record to help pay for other addicts go to Thamkrabok. </p> <p>That's when I really started to get involved. I suppose I've acted as a catalyst of sorts for Tim's dream. We decided if we could get someone famous to sing one of the songs, it would really help. I rewrote Tim's letter to Sting, because I get lots of letters and there are so many you look at and think: 'Ooh, I can't wade through this'! I saw Sting at a Children in Need event, and I approached him with the record, but I didn't really follow it up. And I know Cliff Richard quite well so I gave him one as well, but again I felt rather embarrassed after. </p> <p>I rang up Madonna's PA and I sent her a copy; and one of my daughters went to Elton John's house - you know, walked up the drive! - with a letter. I even went to Glastonbury and appeared in Heat. Well, I don't give tuppence for personal celebrity - I'm too old and lazy - but I've done the best I can, and we managed to put arrows in all directions, including with the NME , who came out to Thamkrabok with me, Tim, Polly and two of my daughters. </p> <p>I really wanted to see the monastery as Tim talked about it so much, and it was incredible. Peaceful, beautiful and ramshackle at the same time, because there's always building going on. I think the abbot thinks the devil finds work for idle hands, or whatever it is, so there's a wonderful work ethic there. People sweeping, building, grinding rock to create these Buddhas and temples. Plus the addicts wear these very attractive pink and terracotta pyjamas. I've done my bit for the fund now - I've got five children and grandchildren and a life that I have to attend to, so I can't be as singleminded as Tim - but I hope Tim's music and the fund helps people get to Thamkrabok because it's an inspirational place, and I know now how much help addicted people really need. </p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Actress June Brown, 77, has played the character of Dot in EastEnders for nearly 20 years. Following her godson's successful drug treatment at Thamkrabok, Thailand, she has become an enthusiastic advocate of the monastery.</p> <p>My godmother June Brown has been so important to my recovery from drug addiction. Her belief in me made me want to get better. Even when I was behaving like a total scoundrel, she stood there and said: 'I know you're going to do great things still.' </p> <p>I come from a theatre family - my mother is a cabaret singer and TV personality - so I've grown up with showbiz and I was always a bit like Saffy from Ab Fab , always the one to tell people that perhaps they should have an early night. I used to tell my first band that they couldn't smoke dope on the tour bus! So my becoming a crack addict was something nobody was expecting. </p> <p>My band signed a major record deal when I was 19, and I was in the charts, the single was on the radio, I was doing MTV, the lot. Then I lost it all by the time I was 21 - I found out my girlfriend had slept with someone else the day before Jocasta got dropped by Sony. It was like someone had sent a letter out overnight saying: 'Don't go near Tim any more.' </p> <p>I signed a different publishing deal soon after, but I felt I was losing a grip on things and that's when I started looking to crack to fill the void. I had tried the drug when I was 18 but had stopped when I got my record deal because music was everything to me. But when your life is not working there's a certainty about crack - it does what it says on the tin. I managed to hide my addiction, but I was smoking every night. </p> <p>Three years ago I realised I was killing myself - or rather my soul. But I didn't care. I felt I wasn't worth anything. I remember smoking crack in front of my mother. I thought: 'Why shouldn't I? This is what I do with my life.' At the back of my mind, I think I was trying to embarrass myself because I didn't have any witnesses to what I did - my mum lived in Spain, I lived on my own in Soho. She was in tears. From then on I was very aware that what I was doing, to myself and others, was horrific. </p> <p>A friend of my mum's suggested Thamkrabok monastery as a place where I could get clean. I realised that if I went there and got off drugs, something exciting might happen to my life. That made me really determined. The monastery is nothing like the harsh environment you read about in the papers. I get so upset reading that stuff, because it's basically slagging off the abbot, Luang Por, the man who saved my life, and I won't have it. He's a little 77-year-old monk who does nothing but help people all day long. And Thamkrabok is a place filled with more compassion and hope than you've ever seen in your life. </p> <p>The first five days of treatment are the hardest physically because you take the medicine. It makes you vomit. But the monks also routinely take the medicine every couple of days as a way to purge themselves. As you take the medicine, the monks cheer you on, believing you're in the first stages of saying goodbye to the life that's been dragging you down. In a strange way, I remember feeling, even as I was throwing up, that this was good, I was helping myself. </p> <p>The monastery is very creative: they do sculpture, architecture, painting and music, and it's a community of 14,000; the treatment centre is only a tiny part of life there. I was fascinated by the music; the monks create it by tracing patterns in the cracks of the earth and rock and translating it into melodies. I ended up forgetting why I was at Thamkrabok in the first place. Before I left, the monks wanted to check I was feeling strong and moving towards the future, but from the way I talked they could probably tell it might be difficult for me to get back into the music business in England. So they invited me to stay and they said they'd build me a studio so I could make a record out there. </p> <p>I flew home, put my stuff in storage and went straight back out. The monks bought me \u00a38,000 worth of equipment and have never wanted anything back, other than that I teach them how to use programs to make their music. That generosity of spirit is incredible. That's what people need to hear about Thamkrabok, not this rubbish about people being beaten with sticks. </p> <p>I wanted to become a monk after I finished making the record, but the monks told me to come back here, promote the music and tell people about the monastery. I found I had a lot of support back in England, and by the time I went back to Thailand I had the NME with me, plus my mum and June Brown, who's like family to me anyway. </p> <p>So it was wonderful - all my dreams came true at once. Now I'm playing in a band and performing again, which I love. The difference now is if it all goes belly up, it doesn't matter. I've found a new purpose, I know I'm needed, and I know who I am, and that's enough. </p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong> Tim Arnold, 27, achieved chart success in the Nineties with his band, Jocasta.

  "The photocopied notices appeared on the blue mosque door in Uruzgan, a small town below a line of jagged mountains, early on Friday morning. Pinned up by an unknown hand under cover of darkness, their local name - 'night letters' - has an almost romantic ring. Their message does not. <p>'A holy war has been declared against the infidel,' announced the first letter, attached to the door with black tape. Christians, led by the US, were invading, said the second. Any Afghan working with them would be 'severely punished', warned the third. At the bottom of each was a common signature: 'The Taliban'. </p> <p>Three weeks before Afghanistan's presidential election, the black-turbaned Taliban are intensifying efforts to scupper the vote. Hunted by 18,000 US-led soldiers and scattered throughout the southern provinces, the insurgents have turned to a dual tactic of assassination and intimidation. </p> <p>More than 30 election workers have been killed across the country. Two weeks ago a car bomb exploded in Kabul, killing three American security guards and at least nine other people. Then this week the US-backed interim president, Hamid Karzai - favourite to win the 9 October poll - became the target. </p> <p>Last Thursday, a rocket narrowly missed Karzai's helicopter as it landed in the south-east town of Gardez. The tightly protected Karzai was forced to abandon the rally, his first of the campaign. A day later police arrested three Taliban suspects and found explosives and detonators. </p> <p>A Taliban spokesman later said it intended to attack each of the 18 candidates for the presidency. But in rural areas like Uruzgan - the rugged, southern province where its fugitive leader, Mullah Omar, once lived - the Taliban are determined to discourage voters from even venturing into the polling booths. </p> <p>As well as attacking the US - a remote explosion in the province wounded three soldiers on Friday - the Taliban are employing 'night letters' as a primary weapon in the campaign of intimidation. Election officials, teachers and ordinary voters are receiving the threatening notes every day, said Atiqulla, the provincial electoral co-ordinator. </p> <p>'They are told that if they co-operate with the elections, they will be killed. It's the Taliban's new way of preaching to them,' he said, speaking at his office in the heavily fortified UN compound in the regional capital, Tarin Kowt. </p> <p>His election team in Uruzgan is virtually under siege. The central government has no control over the lawless province, where power sways between US troops, local militia, and small bands of roaming Taliban fighters. </p> <p>Although the Americans provided security for voter registration, the election teams have been left on their own for the current civic education drive - considered crucial in a country that has never experienced a full democratic vote before. </p> <p>On the streets of Tarin Kowt it is impossible to detect that a major election is looming, even though more than 200,000 people have reg istered to vote across the province. There are no election posters, and not one of the 18 candidates has dared to visit. In fact, few voters even know the candidates' names, admitted Atiqulla. </p> <p>'We have no newspapers, no local radio, so we depend on our teams of civic educators. And they are scared.' </p> <p>Since May, five of Atiqulla's staff have been killed and two injured. One was slashed across the chest; another held off a Taliban attack on his house for 90 minutes. </p> <p>The local US military commander, LtCol Terry Sellers, said: 'There's a wrong perception that this is the wild, wild West because Mullah Omar comes from here,' he said. 'There will be an increase in attacks before the election but we will be able to deal with it.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, the furtive Taliban's ability to project fear across the province remains undiminished. At the mosque in Uruzgan, where the night letters were pinned to the front door on Friday morning, the local Mullah said it was the first time such notices had appeared at his mosque. 'I don't know who did it. All I know is that they are not locals.' </p> <p>Another man, Abdullah Khan, said the pamphlets must have come from outside because there was no photocopier in Uruzgan. </p> <p>Moments later a US soldier ripped the letters down, and the Mullah quietly slipped away. </p> <p>The question now is whether the Taliban's intimidation tactics will slow or stop voting in rural areas like Uruzgan. Certainly, there seems to be a quiet determination to pursue democracy. More than 10.5 million of Afghanistan's 27 million people have registered to vote, a far higher figure than had been anticipated.</p>",
  "A bitter row has erupted in the Bradford Conservative Party after Asian members claimed that they were subjected to 'openly racist remarks', including being called 'thieves' and 'drug smugglers'. <p>At least two senior Asian party officers have contacted the Commission for Racial Equality and are threatening to take legal action against the Conservative Party for racial discrimination. </p> <p>Conservative Central Office has now suspended the party to investigate claims of racism and corruption after more than 50 members of the local party demanded action from Tory leader Michael Howard. </p> <p>A dossier of letters sent to Howard and Tory chairman Dr Liam Fox detailing allegations of racism has been obtained by The Observer.

A separate criticism is that the former chairman of the local party, David Brown, resigned at an executive meeting after an Asian candidate, Haroon Rashid, was selected to fight the next general election. It is claimed he said he could not support an ethnic community candidate and that he had been promised a white candidate. </p> <p>One of those who has written to Howard listing the allegations is Alyas Khan, the deputy chairman of the Bradford West Conservative Association. Khan joined the party in 1982 and is one of the longest-serving Asian members of the party. He would not comment on the claims while the complaint was under investigation. </p> <p>Ahmed Rashid, party treasurer in Bradford, who also wrote to Central Office detailing claims of racism, said: 'The issues are serious and I have heard members openly use racist remarks that are intolerable. The promise of a white candidate for the seat, I believe, is also against the law.' </p> <p>Another Asian member of the party who wished to remain anonymous said: 'I joined the party because I shared its values. I know politics can be filthy but I was unprepared for some of the extreme views I heard... We are hoping to go into government but we need to get our own house in order first.' </p> <p>The dossier seen by The Observer reveals the race row openly surfaced in October last year when the party selected Rashid, a British Airways executive, as its candidate to fight the seat. White activists within the party were backing Simon Cooke, the deputy leader of Bradford council, who made a Nazi salute and called out 'Sieg Heil' at the end of a speech by German-born Labour councillor during a council debate. No action was taken against Cooke, who apologised afterwards. </p> <p>Six months after Rashid was selected he was a target for a sting by the News of the World. Rashid was secretly videoed allegedly admitting to rigging the selection vote. It was suggested he has used family members to vote who lived outside the area and got a friend to vote in the name of somebody who had been dead for seven years. </p> <p>Rashid, who is a brother of the party treasurer, denied the claims but was suspended and is the subject of a Central Office investigation. Some factions in the party believe the tabloid sting was helped by rogue elements within the Tory party. </p> <p>Whoever was responsible set in train a bitter battle of control of the party between white and the 200-plus Asian members, who are in the majority. John Hardy, secretary of the Bradford party, has been trying to mediate between the two sides.He pointed out that in the last two general elections the party had fielded a candidate from the ethnic community who had not won, so there was a genuine debate as to whether a white candidate would fare better. </p> <p>However, he said: 'I wish it was true that race was not an issue in this whole business, but it is. There are strong views from both white and Asian members of the party.' </p> <p>A spokesman from the Conservative Central Office said they could not comment until the party's investigation was concluded. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:antony.barnett@observer.co.uk\">antony.barnett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Nymphs and Shepherds</strong> Etcetera Theatre, London NW1</p> <p>Pleading the cause of a paedophile is not going to win the playwright David Hines many new friends. But his 80-minute monologue, a sort of Alan Bennett-ish Talking Head-case, beautifully and deftly delivered by Andrew C. Wadsworth (an Olivier-nominated musical theatre actor of some pedigree), is horribly enthralling. </p> <p>You learn something about men who prowl the city parks and prey on young girls. Men with this obsession, a recurrent lapse in a moment of ecstatic madness that Hines defines as the drumbeat of desire. Still, Wadsworth's rootless Oliver seems oblivious to the trust he betrays, the innocence he exploits, the childish beauty he defiles. </p> <p>As he waits for the police to arrive in connection with a missing girl, he summarises his list of activities and tries to explain them with reference to his background. You don't, however, feel that any such bid for the sympathy vote would deter you from ripping off the man's head if he came anywhere near your own child's school playground. </p> <p>This difficult area was much better tackled by Bryony Lavery in her recently acclaimed play Frozen. Here, you just want the guy put down. Naggingly, though, you also see what he's on about.</p>",
  "Giorgio Angelozzi once kept bright-eyed Roman teenagers entranced, telling them tales of the adventures of Ulysses and enticing them to chat up the girls with lines from Virgil and Horace. <p>But retirement finally came, his daughter moved abroad and his wife, the love of his life, died. 'Il Professore' found himself alone, high up in the hills east of Rome, with only his books and seven cats for company. Now he is the most famous pensioner in Italy. Angelozzi disturbed the conscience of a nation with an advert he placed in a newspaper offering \u20ac500 (\u00a3340) to any family willing to adopt him as a grandfather. His act changed his life. </p> <p>'There were some days when I did not say a word,' he said. 'Sometimes I found myself calling for my dear wife, Lucia, as if she was just through in the kitchen. But she died in 1992.' </p> <p>The neat, bearded, bespectacled former philosophy teacher had little in common with his fellow villagers and rarely ventured out for long. His great excursion each month was to fill a taxi with crates of cat food at a supermarket in nearby Tivoli. </p> <p>Angelozzi kept himself busy reading and talking to his cats and his one real friend and neighbour, the curator of the village museum. Every now and then, the chief of the local carabinieri popped in to check he was all right. </p> <p>But each day life was getting harder. 'My eyes have got worse and my hands tremble. I have to use a magnifying glass to read the newspaper or a book and I cannot hold it still any more.' </p> <p>The rare times the phone rang his heart leapt in the hope of it being Loredana, his 53-year-old daughter, an aid worker who last called from Kabul at Easter. </p> <p>Finally, he decided he would be better off in a old people's home, but discovered that his \u20ac1,400 (\u00a3950) pension would not allow him the luxury. Hence the advert. Since it appeared in August, he has been deluged with letters and the phone has not stopped. Scores of would-be adopters and sympathisers have contacted him from as far away as New Zealand, Canada, Colombia and Britain. </p> <p>'I was in a sentimental and intellectual desert,' he said. 'I thought that this way I would feel some much-needed drops of rain. There's been a flood.' </p> <p>In Italy, a millionaire has offered a life of luxury in his seaside villa, complete with servants. Antonello Venditti, a former pupil turned pop singer, has offered to take him in. And several elderly women leading equally lonely lives have been calling 'breakfast, noon and night'. </p> <p>But one voice has touched Angelozzi more than all the others. 'When I hear it,' he said, closing his eyes, 'I feel like a cat having its head stroked. I want to ask her to repeat all the days of the week and count to 100 so I can listen.' </p> <p>That voice, of a mother in northern Italy, has answered Angelozzi's dream. He is preparing to pack up what is left of his old life and start a new one. He hopes to make himself useful teaching classical languages to the couple's teenage son. </p> <p>Italy has the world's oldest population and because of social and economic changes, millions of over-65s in a country once famed for its strong family-based culture are alone without any assistance. Independent research agency Eurispes estimates that over-65s will increase from more than 10 million now, roughly one in five Italians, to almost 15 million in 2026. By 2051, 18 million will be pensioners. </p> <p>'Solitude is the biggest problem for the elderly who are not dying of hunger,' said Carlo Fatuzzo, Italy's first and so far Europe's only member of a 'pensioners' party' to have won a seat in the European parliament. </p> <p>'Until now, pensioners' problems have always been the last priority for governments. But pensioners are beginning to take the power that strength in numbers gives them. It is time to realise that being old doesn't mean you are defunct.'</p>",
  "<p>John Kerry wants to challenge George W Bush over his record on the economy, calling November's election a 'national shareholders' meeting' for US Inc and urging the electorate to let him clear up the 'fiscal mess' its current President has left them in. So what are the two main parties actually proposing to do about the economy? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Boom or bust? In the Wall Street Journal last week, Kerry said the economy had 'still not turned the corner' and 'store owners, stock traders, factory foremen and optimistic entrepreneurs' had all told him the economy 'can do better'. Bush's campaign team responded angrily, insisting he had inherited a 'tired and crippled economy that then experienced the most extraordinary confluence of shocks that has occurred in any business cycle in modern US economic history', and jobs were now being created again. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Balancing the budget: Kerry says he will slash the deficit in half during his first term, though since he is also promising to cut taxes and make healthcare more affordable, no one is sure exactly how he plans to manage it. He has promised to hold down the growth in discretionary spending to the rate of inflation, though that pledge excludes the crucial areas of homeland security and defence, to avoid the charge of allowing penny-pinching to come before the 'war on terror'. </p> <p>His campaign does say, 'if Congress cannot agree on savings, John Kerry will be willing to sacrifice some of his priorities, if necessary, to control spending'. In addition, he has set out an eclectic list of cost-cutting measures, from collecting royalties for mineral rights on federal lands to reducing the number of contractors employed by the government by 100,000. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tax: Bush wants to make permanent his sweeping programme of tax cuts, originally sold as giving a temporary boost to the economy. Democrats would curtail the cuts, but only for taxpayers earning more than $200,000 a year. Kerry would spend the money he saved on education and health care. He calls this 'choosing the middle class'. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Trade: Like motherhood and apple pie, 'free trade' is strongly favoured by both candidates. Kerry says Bush has been too weak in defending America's interests against infringements of the global trading rules; the President insists he's been 'aggressive' in ensuring a level playing field. Kerry wants to write rules on labour rights and environmental standards into all new trade agreements, a move that poor countries usually oppose, seeing it as raising the costs of compet ing in the global market. He also wants to force government contractors to 'buy American'. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Business: Bush's business agenda focuses on increasing skills in the workforce, as well as creating 'opportunity zones' to encourage businesses to invest in poor areas. Kerry says he wants to tip the balance towards small businesses by increasing federal venture capital funding, expanding loans for micro-enterprises and simplifying the tax code. He is also offering a 50 per cent tax credit to help firms meet the cost of providing healthcare insurance to their workers. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Energy: Both candidates want to increase America's 'energy independence'. Bush's main proposal involves building an oil pipeline out of Alaska, though he says he will also 'remove unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles' to building new refineries, and 'ensure a future for nuclear power'. Kerry has promised a more radical approach, with the specific aim of reducing America's dependence on the Middle East, which he says is putting national security at risk. He says he will encourage research into 'clean, renewable sources of energy that no terrorist can sabotage and no foreign government can seize'. He also wants to encourage cleaner, more efficient use of coal and gas. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Outsourcing: Kerry blames tax breaks for multinationals based abroad for giving US firms an incentive to shift workers overseas - 'if a company is trying to choose between building a factory in Michigan or Malaysia, our tax code actually encourages them to locate in Asia'. He says he will close the loophole and spend the $12bn it will save on a 5 per cent cut in corporate tax rates. Bush says such a measure would just put US multinationals at a competitive disadvantage to foreign rivals. Kerry also supports consumers' 'right to know' where the call centres they use are based.</p>",
  "The fate of the world's most famous bottled water will be resolved this week when the French government intervenes in a stand-off between Perrier's Swiss owner, Nestl\u00e9, and its workers. <p>Worn down by a lengthy conflict with the French trade unions, Nestl\u00e9 has threatened to move production elsewhere if negotiations collapse, cutting the ties between the drink marketed as the 'champagne of table water' and its historic source in the south of France. </p> <p>Otherwise the plant faces being sold, an implicit admission of defeat by Nestl\u00e9 in the face of strict French employment laws. Although mineral water sales are booming and the drink remains popular, the company has complained that the rigidity of French law makes the plant hopelessly unproductive. It claims that the average worker at the Perrier source produces only 600,000 bottles a year, a third of the production rate of workers at its Italian San Pellegrino plant. </p> <p>The conflict has caused anguish in France as foreign investors frustrated by tough labour legislation look to move to cheaper locations. France has committed itself to some reform of the 35-hour week to make itself more competitive, but ministers face a tough battle to woo back large companies. </p> <p>Once British-owned, Perrier has become so emblematic of French manufacturing that last week the Finance Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, joined last-ditch efforts to win over representatives from the communist-backed CGT union. Warning of a 'deplorable lose-lose' situation, he criticised the union for blocking plans to reduce costs. Workers' representatives have rejected an early retirement programme for 1,047 employees and strikes over the past few months have reduced output by up to a million bottles a day. </p> <p>Sarkozy is due to meet Nestl\u00e9 executives on Tuesday to plead with them to reopen talks with the union. 'The dreadful thing about the trade union's brinkmanship, over and above the anxiety it is causing for employees, is the image it gives of our country, which discourages certain investors,' he said. </p> <p>Perrier's history has had troubled stretches ever since Napoleon III granted the source at Verg\u00e8ze, near Nimes, mineral water status in 1863. An enterprising doctor, Louis Perrier, first saw the spring's commercial properties, marketing it as a beverage which could soothe toothache and stomach pains. </p> <p>He attracted the interest of St John Harmsworth (whose older brothers Alfred, later Lord Northcliffe, and Harold, later Lord Rothermere, went on to found the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph), who bought it in 1903 with the aim of converting everyone in the British Empire to buying bottled mineral water. </p> <p>During the Second World War the plant was requisitioned by the Germans and was later sold for a small sum to the French. The product flourished until 1990, when traces of carcinogenic benzene were found in the bottled water, forcing a worldwide product recall at a cost of around \u00a3100 million to the company. Nestl\u00e9 bought the plant in 1992.</p>",
  "Bloated, blue-collar Americans - gorged on diets of fries and burgers, but denied their share of US riches - are bringing the nation's steady rise in life expectancy to a grinding halt. <p>Twenty years ago, the US, the richest nation on the planet, led the world's longevity league. Today, American women rank only 19th, while males can manage only 28th place, alongside men from Brunei. </p> <p>These startling figures are blamed by researchers on two key factors: obesity, and inequality of health care. A man born in a poor area of Washington can have a life expectancy that is 40 years less than a woman in a prosperous neighbourhood only a few blocks away, for example. </p> <p>'A look at the Americans' health reveals astonishing inequalities in our society,' state Professor Lawrence Jacobs of Minnesota University and Professor James Morone, of Brown University, Rhode Island, in the journal American Prospect . </p> <p>Their paper is one of a recent swathe of studies that have uncovered a shocking truth: America, once the home of the world's best-fed, longest-lived people, is now a divided nation made up of a rich elite and a large underclass of poor, ill-fed, often obese, men and women who are dying early. </p> <p>In another newly published paper, statisticians at Boston College reveal that in France, Japan and Switzerland, men and women aged 65 now live several years longer than they do in the US. Indeed, America only just scrapes above Mexico and most East European nations. </p> <p>This decline is astonishing given America's wealth. Not only is it Earth's richest nation, it devotes more gross domestic product - 13 per cent - to health care than any other developed nation. Switzerland comes next with 10 per cent; Britain spends 7 per cent. As the Boston group - Alicia Munnell, Robert Hatch and James Lee - point out: 'The richer a country is, the more resources it can dedicate to education, medical and other goods and services associated with great longevity.' The result in every other developed country has been an unbroken rise in life expectancy since 1960. </p> <p>But this formula no longer applies to America, where life expectancy's rise has slowed but not yet stopped, because resources are now so unevenly distributed. When the Boston College group compared men and women in America's top 10 per cent wage bracket with those in the bottom ten per cent, they found the former group earned 17 times more than the latter. In Japan, Switzerland and Norway, this ratio is only five-to-one. </p> <p>Jacobs and Morone state: 'Check-ups, screenings and vaccinations save lives, improve well-being, and are shockingly uneven [in America]. Well-insured people get assigned hospital beds; the uninsured get patched up and sent back to the streets.' For poor Americans, health service provision is little better than that in third world nations. 'People die younger in Harlem than in Bangladesh,' report Jacobs and Morone. </p> <p>Consumption of alcohol, tobacco and food can also have a huge impact on life expectancy. The first two factors are not involved with America's longevity crisis. Smoking and drinking are modest compared with Europe. Food consumption is a different matter, however, for the US has experienced an explosion in obesity rates in the past 20 years. As a result, 34 per cent of all women in the US are obese compared with 4 per cent in Japan. For men, the figures are 28 and 2 per cent respectively. </p> <p>'US obesity rates jumped in the 1980s and 1990s, and the vast majority of the population affected by obesity had not yet reached age 65 by 2000,' state the Boston group. 'As the large baby boom cohort begins to turn 65 in coming years, a stronger connection between obesity rates and life expectancy may emerge.' </p> <p>In other words, as the nation's middle-aged fatties reach retirement age, more and more will start to die out. Life expectancy in the US could then actually go into decline.</p>",
  "<p>Sunny day, late October, 1997: Damien Hirst is in his Bloomsbury office. A Gary Hume painting hangs on the wall, alongside a Sam Taylor-Wood and several Warhol Electric Chairs, a nod to a master of life-meets-art. Hirst is in full stroboscopic mode, flickering between the outward and the guarded, the negative pole being that he has just pulled out of one restaurant co-venture, Quo Vadis in Soho, the positive that he has another, Pharmacy, opening soon in Notting Hill. </p> <p>'I'm getting more satisfaction out of doing it than I am in the art world, doing an exhibition,' he says. 'It's like going on instinct. It feels absolutely right. Prada's doing the costumes, Jasper Morrison's doing the furniture. But it's all around my idea. It's big. It's a restaurant and a bar. And it's going to be around a lot longer than you and I.'</p> <p>'Restaurants don't last that long,' I say.</p> <p>'Yeah. But this will. I definitely see it as an inspiration,' he says. </p> <p>It didn't last.</p> <p>Hirst is not only a major artist, but credited with extraordinary skills in the management of his career, so the announcement that the pieces he had created for Pharmacy would be in a single-artist sale at Sotheby's, New Bond Street on 18 October has been seen as a coup. So it is - if not the one he first intended. </p> <p>Pharmacy was a living artwork, empowered by celebrity. Celebrity took it to the heights. Then celebrity dumped it. And now a celebrity auction has turned it back into art again.</p> <p>12 August 2004, another sunny day. Hirst's office has morphed. Upstairs there is a Kurt Schwitters, downstairs the Taylor-Wood hangs alongside a Sarah Lucas nude. Some 'Picassos' and 'Matisses', acquired via eBay, are strewn on a sofa. The artist himself, fuller in the face, has a four-day stubble and is wearing a T-shirt with lines by William Blake, ending 'in the darkest hour there may be light'. We sit in the garden and he settles into anatomising the rise and fall of Pharmacy with elan. </p> <p>The notion that Hirst should create an 'art' restaurant had been presented to him by the publicist Matthew Freud, and a partner of Freud's, Jan Kennedy, at a meeting in the Groucho Club. The idea had been Kennedy's. 'Damien and I are very passionate about restaurants,' he tells me. Hirst looked over the proposed space. It was a downer. 'They took me to this basement in Soho and it was horrible. Really low ceilings and pillars everywhere. So I said, \"Fuck off!\" And then, as we were going out, we went past a bar. It was called Tall Orders. </p> <p>I said, \"Now, if you had a place like that I'd definitely do something with you.\"'</p> <p>Two weeks later, Freud and Kennedy proposed another space: Quo Vadis, a venerable Soho eatery. This suited Hirst just fine. Another Freud connection was brought in, the fiery-tempered 'celebrity chef' Marco Pierre White.</p> <p>Hirst was to contribute the art. For this he was offered a directorship and shares. The timing was spot on. Cool Britannia ruled the waves, New Labour was humming like a dynamo and both Britpop and the YBAs - with Damien Hirst as the resident sacred monster - were in full spate. Hirst, moreover, likes to get his art out into the real world. He finds the art-food connection easy to make and quotes such antecedents as Gordon Matta-Clark, the New York Conceptualist, who started an artists' restaurant, Food, in the Seventies, and Rirkrit Tiravanija, whose artwork is cooking for people.</p> <p>Also, Hirst is one of the handful of artists who are known not just in the art world and the fashionable world, but who have joined the cast of footballers and pop tarts on planet tabloid. As for Freud, with a client list that included Pepsi, the BBC and Nike, along with Chris Evans and Ant &amp; Dec, he was well equipped both to put a deal together and to bring in art materials from the real world. And what material is more real world than celebrity?</p> <p>Quo Vadis gelled briefly, but Hirst and MPW were soon clashing over issues of control. 'I got I think it was a 78-page fax, which was the contract,' Hirst says. 'So I kind of freaked out. I bailed out. </p> <p>I just couldn't do it. But then I realised that I had put them right in it. And I felt bad about it. So I said, \"Look! I'll lend you my collection of art, if you'll give the artists food.\"'</p> <p>Marco Pierre White agreed. Hirst installed work by Rachel Whiteread, Gary Hume, Marc Quinn, Gavin Turk, Fiona Rae, Sarah Lucas and Marcus Harvey. It was YBA in excelcis. The group enjoyed what Kennedy calls 'a taste of success', so he was keen when the publicists showed him another building. </p> <p>This was 150 Notting Hill Gate, formerly the Cleopatra Taverna. 'It was a Greek plate-smashing-type operation that everybody had looked at and thought, hey, that would make a really nice site for a proper restaurant,' says Chris Bodker of Notting Hill restaurant Kensington Place. Because of its perpetually drawn curtains and few customers, the Cleopatra had been a source of local gossip. 'We called it the \"Death Site\",' says Sophie Parkin, novelist and former manager of the modish bar, Zanzibar. Why? 'There used to be burial pits there. Plague pits.'</p> <p>Hirst loved the space. 'It all came to me in a flash,' he says. 'I'd been working on the Pharmacy installation for Dallas.' This was a recreation of the piece he first showed at Tanya Bonakdar's Cohen Gallery on Madison Avenue in 1992. 'I was re-doing it. It was in my mind. And the more I thought about it, the more involved I got. I said the only way I could do it is if I had an unlimited amount of time and an unlimited budget. And they agreed.'</p> <p>Freud brought in another partner, Liam Carson, a one-time guiding spirit at the Groucho, who had just been what he calls the 'dogsbody consultant' at the then white-hot Momo in the West End. Hirst set to work. 'I think that basically I was using cash which was for running the place when it opened. But they didn't discuss that. They just paid for everything. I was spending quite a lot on things and then destroying them or not using them, which wasn't cost-effective.' </p> <p>Hirst designed pill-popping wallpaper, the typeface for the P logo, bar stools topped with aspirins, ashtrays, egg cups and Martini glasses (which never got past the prototype phase, but have been signed and are in the sale anyway). He hung 13 Butterfly paintings. He made a sculpture modelled on his own DNA. He installed disturbing still lifes using materials such as surgical instruments and Elastoplast. </p> <p>'I tried to control everything. But you use other people's ideas because there's so much to do.' Thus the staff got Prada-designed lab coats and he let the barman - Dick Bradsell, 'who used to run the Atlantic' - give the cocktails names like Detox and Cough Syrup. And he stuck a green neon cross out the front - just like at a real pharmacy.</p> <p>Across at Quo Vadis, though, Marco Pierre White was not content. 'It just seemed like a conflict of interest between the two establishments,' he tells me. 'At the end of the day you can't have a foot in both camps.' Hirst says: 'I think Marco wasn't very happy that I put my friends' art in there. I think he thought I hadn't given it my all.'</p> <p>Things shot up way past room temperature. </p> <p>'I took the collection out of Quo Vadis,' Hirst says. 'And then Marco put his own art in there. He copied my work, of course.'</p> <p>So Hirst was out of Quo Vadis. But Pharmacy had come together. 'I brought in a chef from France,' says Carson. 'Sonya Lee. She'd been with [Alain] Ducasse. She was 50 per cent Norwegian and 50 per cent Korean, and a 100 per cent pain in the arse.'</p> <p>It was also a real artwork.</p> <p>Too real, maybe. 'There was perhaps a cut-off point where some of the materials should have been more conventional,' Kennedy says. Michael Craig-Martin, who taught Hirst at Goldsmiths, disagrees. 'Damien took something which is part of the ordinary world and made it exactly as one would make a work of art,' he says. 'He made all the decisions that you would do exactly as if you were making an artwork. Except it's a restaurant. And he exercised total control of what everything looked like. You have to have financial control for this. He came to this point where his financial power was enormous and he used it in this very, very unusual way.'</p> <p>The launch was on New Year's Eve 1997. That night, according to the columnist Toby Young, 'entered London folklore as possibly the best party of the Nineties. Celebrities outnumbered civilians.' The public opening was on 19 January and the first five customers were puzzled citizens brandishing prescriptions. There were other bugs. 'Somebody complained there wasn't enough food,' says Hirst. 'So I sent out for pizzas. To the Pizza Express over the road.'</p> <p>Much of the subsequent coverage was predictably cartoony. 'Would I be presented with half a cow floating in formaldehyde?' jested Norman Lamont. The food was praised, though. And for the next six months Pharmacy became the hottest ticket in London. When Alvaro's was hot in the Sixties, it had an unlisted phone number. These being grabbier times, Pharmacy hired bouncers. </p> <p>Jan Kennedy says neither he nor Hirst had been ready for this triumph. They had expected the place to build slowly. 'We were a victim of circumstance,' he says. 'We attempted to go in low-key and it just exploded.'</p> <p>It was all down to timing. According to style analyst Peter York, 'It was about the time that dotcommery was arising. So you could have business-without-tears, business without gravity. Business without having to wear a suit. People believed several impossible things before breakfast. It was that time. Where is that bar now?'</p> <p>Hirst says, 'I was quite surprised by the way that eating in a chemist's actually worked. I think I probably expected it to be more of an uncomfortable dining experience, but it turned out not to be.'</p> <p>The Royal Pharmaceutical Society did find it uncomfortable. Disturbed by reports of upset seniors looking for a pharmacist, they took out an injunction, demanding a name change. 'This was the one manipulation we engaged in,' Kennedy says. Knowing any punishments would be piffling, they milked it. Presented with this Duchampian accident, Hirst came up with a Duchampian invention. Every few weeks he changed the name to a different anagram of 'pharmacy' - Army Chap, Achy Ramp, Archy Map - getting a fresh jolt of media attention each time. Then they placated the Royal Society by ditching the green cross and softening the name to Pharmacy Restaurant and Bar. Which was still a dazzling success.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it also dazzled the moneymen behind the operation. They took Pharmacy on to the market, by reverse takeover of the Hartford Group, a public company. There was talk of branding Pharmacy, of cloning it. 'We were naive,' Kennedy says. 'The agendas of public companies are likely to be different from ours. That was when it turned sour from a relationship point of view.'</p> <p>Hirst agrees. 'It was a mistake. That was what we disagreed on. From the beginning,' he says. He squished any notion of opening another Pharmacy. 'It would never work. It's PR,' Hirst says, 'and a lot of people in PR think PR is selling shit to cunts. And there was a certain amount of bullshit involved. We had to say it was a lot more successful behind the scenes than it was.'</p> <p>It's striking that he didn't anticipate the process under way in Pharmacy. It's one he has used elegantly in one of his pieces, A Thousand Years. In this, flies breed from maggots in a rotting cow's head and buzz around until they are sizzled by an electronic exterminator. Hello, entropy. The backlash against Pharmacy had begun even before it opened. When the joint was at its zenith, the anti-buzz buzz kept pumping. 'It's no great surprise that the sneering has already started,' Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall wrote in The Independent. Many of the antis expressed the traditional British distaste for over-the-top success; others merely disliked high-concept restaurants. Even some artists felt this way. 'I particularly enjoyed the lighting downstairs. It felt like streetlights inside. There was something strangely spooky about it,' says Gavin Turk. 'It was well executed but it seemed too much of a concept restaurant to me.' </p> <p>That the place began to cool after its six dazzling months will surprise nobody familiar with the life-cycle of a-space-as-an-event. 'It was unnatural. Good restaurants don't come in with a brouhaha like that,' Liam Carson says. 'The Ivy and Le Caprice don't have all that bullshit.' </p> <p>Carson joined the project in August 1997 and was gone by the end of 1999. By then, most of the big names were gone, too. They had never gone to Pharmacy for its food. As soon as the seductive buzz subsided, they were off somewhere new, and were replaced by ordinary folk. The partners were floundering. 'There were so many egos floating around. It was hard to maintain a forwards direction,' Carson says. 'There were too many chiefs and not enough Indians.'</p> <p>Damien Hirst was one of the last to pick up on the earth tremors. 'I was drinking a lot in those days. I was using it like I used the Groucho Club. Things were kind of going wrong, but I became aware of it when I talked to somebody who worked behind the bar and I said, \"How's it going?\" and he said, \"Not very well.\" I said, \"What do you mean?\" He said, \"Well, we're not getting paid in time.\" So then I talked to my partners. I said, \"Look, why are the people behind the bar not getting paid?\" And they said, \"Don't talk to the staff!\" That was like the end of it to me! If I can't talk to the staff I'm not fucking going there. So I kind of stopped going there. Then it sort of deteriorated. I called up my partners and said, \"Look, I hear there's problems.\" And they said, \"No! There's no problems. It's all fine!\" And I had a meeting for lunch. </p> <p>I turned up early and, like, 20 of the staff were on the street outside, on strike. I said, \"What are you doing here?\" They said, \"Oh, we're not going in because we're not getting paid.\" It was like Laurel and Hardy. It was all a bit funny like that. And the disabled toilet was filled with wine, and the cloakroom was filled with fruit and veg. We hadn't got enough space.'</p> <p>The project was faltering.</p> <p>'I wanted it to be a world-class restaurant,' Hirst says. 'So when it was cool to start with, that was the idea. But then the chefs kept changing, the personnel changed. They were trying to do too many things. Friday and Saturday nights, there were queues around the block. It was a rocking drinking bar, but it was really chaos. They were trying to get lunchtime trade as well. But you can't really have that and the other. It's really difficult. If there's love involved in it, then you can do it. But once it starts to deteriorate...'</p> <p>Pharmacy, the highest of high-concept restaurants, had a personality problem. It had become just a joint with a lot of Damien Hirst's art in it. Then he took the art away. Its exterior weirdly unchanged, the site is now a branch of Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>It so happens that the arc described by Pharmacy coincided with other changes in the artist's life. Long noted for such rock-star antics as appearing naked in the Groucho Club, Hirst buried himself with wife and family in Devon. He now has a studio in the Cotswolds. 'I've had a drink about five times in the past year,' he says. 'I've tried to control it but I just can't. Every time I've found myself at five in the morning with a bottle of wine, drinking from the bottle. As soon as I have a drink with a meal, I start watching the wine. And I can't concentrate on what people are saying.' There was also the Charles Saatchi spat. The collector-dealer is the single greatest source of strength in the British contemporary art market, but can also be its most unsettling element. He let it be known that he was preparing to sell off most of his Hirsts. </p> <p>'We were aware of that,' Hirst says. </p> <p>'I was lucky because I had made a bit of money on my last show with Jay [Jopling]. And Jay helped me out enormously. He said the prices are too high for the work. But I said I wanted them. So Jay worked with me to buy them myself. Instead of coming halves with me on the whole deal.' </p> <p>They were early works. Hirst hadn't kept examples. 'I never kept a formaldehyde piece. I had none of my early spots. In the beginning I just didn't care. Now I've got the big cow. I've got the fish piece, which is great. And the fly piece. I've just re-done it, because it was all rusted and falling apart. I've got three medicine cabinets on the wall of my studio. I realised I had sold them for, like, \u00a3500 and got them back for, like, half a million.'</p> <p>The buy-back cost more than \u00a38m. 'I've had them all restored. It's like having a son come back from the war. They come back all battered because they've been all the way around.'</p> <p>Over to Sotheby's and the sale. 'We all knew Pharmacy very well. We had all had dinner there over the years,' Chantal Westphal, co-director of the Contemporary Art department, tells me. 'We were aware that it closed down rather suddenly, and that all the art disappeared overnight. We saw it as a great single-owner sale and proposed it. </p> <p>'Damien wanted to keep the collection together, rather than just sell the paintings through his dealers. So he had two options: either placing the whole collection somewhere or selling it at auction. We agreed on the auction process. Damien liked the idea that he could also sell small things. There are estimates in the sale as low as \u00a350.'</p> <p>Both the auction and catalogue are still works in progress when I visit. The ashtrays are to be sold as two sets of six. I said I assumed a zillion ashtrays must have been left over. 'You'd be surprised,' says Westphal. 'There wasn't much left over, because a lot got stolen, a lot of things got broken. We are pretty much selling everything.'</p> <p>Hirst had sunk a year of his time and energy into the project, but at first he was hands-offish on the sale. 'I said to Sotheby's, \"You do the catalogue. I don't want to get involved.\" And then I just got an idea for the cover and I phoned them up. \"I'll do the cover! I just can't help carrying on with all that Pharmacy stuff.\" They said we could do a limited edition. I said, \"I don't want to do a limited edition of an auction catalogue! I think it'll look like a good book. I'm going to do pills in the sky on the cover.\"'</p> <p>An apt image for an apotheosis. Damien Hirst believed Pharmacy would endure, and it might have done so as a restaurant, even as an 'art' restaurant, but the unstable element was celebrity. Hirst is well used to the slow-building but long-lasting heat of fame in the art world, but the roaring flash-and-ash of media-driven heat operates by different laws. But if celebrity scuppered Pharmacy, the restaurant, Sotheby's is bringing it back to life with a celebrity auction.</p> <p>'For me, it started off as an artwork, as an idea,' Hirst says. 'But when you do an artwork like that and it's full of people and it's functioning, and the food's coming out, and they're eating their dinner, everything seems very much alive. </p> <p>'But then in my mind I told myself it's not art. It's only a restaurant with art in it. So everything became just things for restaurants. I stopped seeing it as the whole thing. And then, as soon as it died, it was like the whole thing became art again - in a really weird way.'</p>",
  "Looking tired and defeated, the British hostage Kenneth Bigley pleaded for his life on videotape yesterday, two days after a shadowy Iraqi militant group kidnapped him and two Americans in Baghdad. <p>In a tape shown by the Arabic TV station al-Jazeera, Bigley's captors yesterday said they would execute him and the American hostages, Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong, within 48 hours, unless the US freed Iraqi women prisoners. </p> <p>The men, who were seized last Thursday from their house in Baghdad's affluent Mansur district, appear to be in the hands of Iraq's militant Tawhid and Jihad group, which has been linked to the radical Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whom the US accuses of plotting numerous terrorist attacks in Iraq and says is allied to al-Qaeda. </p> <p>'The Tawhid and Jihad group gave a 48-hour deadline for the release of the women prisoners in return for releasing the two Americans and Briton kidnapped on Thursday, or they would implement the death penalty against them,' al-Jazeera said. The women should be freed from Abu Ghraib prison and Umm Qasr, another US jail near British-occupied Basra . </p> <p>But it was not clear last night whether the demand was a real one - or a cynical attempt to manipulate Iraqi public opinion, already deeply hostile to the occupation. The last female detainee in Abu Ghraib, Huda Alazawi, a Sunni businesswoman wrongly accused of funding Iraq's resistance, was released on 19 July, The Observer can reveal. </p> <p>There are currently only two women left in US custody in Iraq - both of them senior scientists who worked on Saddam's alleged weapons of mass destruction programme. They are being held with 100 other so-called 'high-value' detainees at Baghdad International Airport. </p> <p>In the video, the three hostages are shown wearing white blindfolds and slumped on the floor of a plain white room. They appear to murmur their names one by one, while a black-hooded man points a gun at the head of one of them. </p> <p>Although the video gives no clues, the hostages are almost certainly being held in Falluja, the Sunni militant stronghold west of Baghdad, and the apparent centre of Iraq's burgeoning kidnapping industry. </p> <p>On Friday, the family of Mr Bigley, a 62-year-old engineer working for Gulf Supplies and Commercial Services, a United Arab Emirates-based firm, called for his release. </p> <p>There has been no word, meanwhile, on the fate of two Italian aid workers Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, seized two weeks ago. It is also unclear whether two French journalists, Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, kidnapped on 20 August, are still alive, although a report yesterday suggested the group holding them might release them. Over the past six months more than 100 foreigners have been seized in Iraq, and at least 30 have been killed. </p> <p>The demand by Tawhid and Jihad that the US should free Iraqi women prisoners follows overwhelming evidence that US guards at Abu Ghraib sexually abused some Iraqi women prisoners - the ultimate taboo in a conservative Islamic society. In the US military's own investigation into the scandal, which broke in April, Maj Gen Antonio Taguba found that a US military policeman had raped a female detainee, while witnesses who spoke to The Observer claim that a 14-year-old girl was 'repeatedly' raped by US soldiers last year. </p> <p>In a note smuggled out of the jail last December, one woman prisoner, Noor, said several women were pregnant after being raped by US guards. She urged the Iraqi resistance to bomb the prison to spare the women 'further shame'. Other women released from Abu Ghraib have disappeared. Iraqi human rights groups believe their families may have murdered them because of the stigma of suspected American sexual abuse. </p> <p>The two women still in US custody are Rihab Taha, a British-educated microbiologist who was in charge of Iraq's alleged biological weapons programme in the late 1980s, and Huda Amash, another scientist involved in Iraq's weapons programme. The US authorities have refused to release Amash, despite the fact she is suffering from breast cancer. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Jeffrey Miller, the general sent by Washington to Iraq in the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal, said the US was currently holding 5,000 Iraqi detainees, 2,400 in Abu Ghraib, 2,500 in Umm Qasr, and 100 at Baghdad airport. Several hundred were released last week. The prisoners are being held without charge, without access to a lawyer, and in defiance of the Geneva Conventions.</p>",
  "I do not give a fig (this being the traditional unit for measuring indifference) about the issue of fox hunting. Despite this, I am an expert in it. The inside of my head is like some First World War battlefield - full of trenches, revetments, barbed wire, shell-holes and splintered trees, slowly fought over by the unchanging armies of the fox hunting debate. I know every inch. We all do. <p>Myself, I would have left the issue alone. The history of prohibition suggests that it is best applied as sparingly as possible; if folks aren't harming others by their actions, then let them be. I admit, however, that the issue of the treatment of animals is something of a problem for the live-and-let-live approach. That's why we have long banned some forms of cruelty to beasts, yet continue to permit others. </p> <p>And partly it should have been let go so that we could have avoided the descent into darker lalaland of some of our more right-wing commentators, a fall that threatens to take with it (as though they were attached by ropes) a small but influential section of British society. </p> <p>The occasion was Wednesday's Commons vote - yet again - to ban hunting, and the interior and alfresco shenanigans that accompanied that vote. Next day, writing in the Mail, Stephen Glover explained that for the demonstrators (unlike the effete and morally deficient MPs) the issue was 'almost literally a matter of life and death'. This sentiment literally means that the ability of many people to continue to draw breath 'almost' depends on the hunting of live foxes with hounds. Elsewhere in the Mail we were told that those in Parliament Square were epitomised by 'jam-making stalwarts of the WI'. But in what way would such a paragon be almost unable to live? Might she be too traumatised to make any more jam? </p> <p>In any case, had not there been a much more traumatic treatment of a section of the British community 20 years ago, one which shattered their way of life and one which jam-makers, Telegraph columnists and polo players had been only too happy to see take place? </p> <p>In the Spectator former Telegraph editor Charles Moore explained why fox hunting and mining couldn't be compared. 'The difference is,' he told readers, 'that the state paid for coal-mining. The state pays nothing for hunting.' So, Moore argues, you can have your unique way of life destroyed if it's a matter of public money. Some bloody principle, that is. And one, incidentally, that you didn't hear from the same lobby at the time of foot and mouth. </p> <p>So far, so illogical, but not actually delusional. Where, however, the rhetoric of outraged hunters becomes damaging for their own cause, is when they claim that the hunting battle is one between a deracinated metropolitan elite and the 'countryside'. If I am not a member of the metropolitan elite, then God alone knows who is (unless it is John Jackson, chair of the London law firm Mishcon de Reya, and chairman of the Countryside Alliance). But among the psychoanalysts, lefty lawyers, Jews and adulterous academics that I know, none of them has ever brought up the question of hunting with me. </p> <p>The anti-hunting MP Tony Banks has this one absolutely right. The letters pages of the Hampstead and Highgate Express contain no calls to ban hunting. You must go to the Shropshire Star for that. And it's worse for the hunting lobby. Mori polls show that in the countryside itself there has been a fairly constant majority of something just under two-to-one in favour of banning hunting. In 2000 in rural areas two in five people (41 per cent) strongly supported a ban and less than one in five (15 per cent) strongly opposed it. The jam-makers of the WI turn out to be on the side of the fox. </p> <p>How strange, given that so many of them stand to lose their jobs and their way of life. But Mori found that though 45 per cent of rural respondents had hunting with hounds taking place in their local area, 89 per cent disagreed with the statement 'Hunting with dogs is an important part of my social life'. </p> <p>This is why the rhetorical attempt to connect the banning of hunting to the poll tax is so misguided. It wasn't - as the myth now has it - the riots that helped force Mrs Thatcher out, it was the polls, and right now, by a very large margin, the British people want an end to fox hunting. </p> <p>That their representatives should so legislate may be illiberal, but is it - as some have argued - totalitarian? Is it an intolerable and almost unprecedented curtailment of what Glover calls (with Pilgerian repetitiveness) the rights of 'free-born Englishmen'? Are we 'criminalising' thousands of 'otherwise law-abiding' fellow citizens? </p> <p>Of course everyone - including serial killers - is 'otherwise law-abiding', but you know what they mean. Nevertheless, can we assert that this ban is more restrictive of rights than forcing millions of people to wear seat belts, put on crash-helmets or stand outside offices in the cold to smoke? And what about the wholesale criminalisation of countless 'otherwise law-abiding' drug-takers, whose personal foibles have been punished by prison sentences which the Mail has routinely declared insufficiently lengthy? And has the legislation been introduced and voted on in an undemocratic way, as the hunt supporters claim? </p> <p>Here we come to central truth that the hunters are trying so hard to evade. They have lost the argument. And far from democracy having been suborned, the hunting debate is an almost perfect example of democracy succeeding. They couldn't have been treated better. </p> <p>Over the years we have seen, for reasons of morality and sentiment, a gradual shift in public opinion against what is seen as unnecessary cruelty to animals. This shift was reflected in the Labour manifestoes of 1997 and 2001, and in all opinion polls conducted during the hunt debate. Even so we have had the Burns Report, we have had attempts at compromise which have been voted down, and just about every half-sentient inhabitant of these islands now knows the arguments backwards, in a way we don't on any other subject. Shooting versus death by hounds, rural job losses, the virtues and vices of drag-hunting and so on and so on, until there isn't a synapse unaffected. And don't we know (and this tells you a lot) that if hunting with hounds were banned, no-one would ever seriously try to reintroduce it? The tide has gone out. </p> <p>And yet, if you wanted to reverse the ban you could - at the next election - vote Conservative. How much more democratic do you want it to be? </p> <p>Instead we are threatened by 'civil disobedience', on the basis that - according to Charles Moore - 'we are in the territory of Martin Luther King, the Ulster Covenant and Votes For Women, where our rulers won't let us be free'. Two of his three examples were about people gaining elementary suffrage. The hunters have the vote. They must be careful that they are not saying to the rest of us that we shouldn't have it too. </p> <p>Some are egging them on. Glover emotes that 'on Wednesday some deep explosive trigger was touched'. I think that's true. It was the sense of entitlement that was touched, the innate narcissism of those who thought stuff only happened to lesser people, who maintained the illusion that their interests were somehow synonymous with those of the real England. </p> <p>They aren't. Yesterday the Commons disrupter, millionaire stud owner, David Redvers told the Telegraph that there were 'any number of things we could do. It could be shutting down the M25 or shutting down London. In this day and age you do not need a bomb to create havoc.' No, but it would be a good idea to have the people on your side. They aren't, David, as you will discover - possibly painfully - when you, and other friends of the princes, come on your shutting-down missions to London or to the M25. </p> <p>Honestly, I sympathise. But you aren't Martin Luther King. So prepare to let it go. Drag hunt. It's over.</p>",
  "<p>Any good editor knows who his or her readers are, of course: but he or she also has to know who they think they are. Say jockeys, polo players, chefs and auctioneers, what you might call 'people from all walks of life' if you were the editor of the Daily Mail . </p> <p>The media joy of the Westminster invasion wasn't eight men in white T-shirts taking on rather a larger number of men in tights. (Even the Mail's Stephen Glover found that an outrage 'beyond defence'). Nor was it quantities of blue blood flowing through Parliament Square. </p> <p>No: the joy came from tables turned, from stereotypes wondrously reversed, from Telegraph readers cast as screaming yobs while the Sun mob surveyed the non-bunfight with studied propriety - 'For Fox Sake!' Oh my miners' strike of long, long ago. The Guardian could tut-tut now with impunity, the Independent safely lay into these 'hooligans in tweed' and the 'breathtaking hypocrisy' of those who gave them an indulgent ride. </p> <p>For what did the usual forces of law and order have to say? They ranted on day one - about the death of the countryside, the death of civilised values, the death of trust in the appalling Blair. 'Civil War', declared the Mail, modestly; pending 'national tragedy' predicted Charles Moore in the Telegraph . But then wiser counsels (or better tranquilisers) began to prevail. </p> <p>Sure, nobody could quite call Simon Heffer a counsel of wisdom. 'Totalitarian Britain', he squeaked. 'The United Kingdom is no longer a democracy'. But Paul Dacre's leader writers were growing more thoughtful. Naturally these country wallahs were a majority of 'largely decent people' who had been 'turned into outcasts and seen their way of life treated with contempt'. </p> <p>Nevertheless (with a screech of the brakes): 'That said, the Mail urges them to have a care. Wednesday was an ugly day for democracy. They mustn't allow frustration to boil over into illegality or violence.' </p> <p>Since that is exactly what they had done already, the ancestral 'that said' gambit (one beloved of editorial writers ever since one hand met the other) didn't carry total conviction. Neither did a Telegraph still proclaiming that country folk 'had been thrown to the dogs' by a Prime Minister forced to kow-tow to 'an atavistic left-wing' (who just happened to have been elected in overwhelming numbers). </p> <p>Any more weasels down the same fox hole? Yip, here came Tom Utley opining that 'Blair and his government have done far more damage to our most precious national institution that a handful of T-shirted demonstrators ever could'. Here, too, was Alice Thomson, declaring: 'the middle classes have had enough'. </p> <p>The what classes? Middle, middle, said Alice firmly. Those 'I met as I walked across St James's Park were working men and women who pay their taxes, send their children to local schools and queue up at local hospitals - firemen, farmers, dentists'. But Alice, love, have you opened your Mail ? 'Five of the eight ... have strong links with the Royal Family.' Luke is a chum of Harry and Wills, and his mater and pater hunt with Charles and Camilla. Robert is a linchpin of polo 'Team Highgrove'. The chef worked for the Royal Yacht, not Jamie Oliver. The Mirror's first day headline pun - 'Toff With Their Heads' - looked strong on fact, if weak on wit. </p> <p>Are the royals good news when their surrogate chaps try hunting for Blair? Probably not. The snorting Sun, going gingerly on class acts because it had its own security scoop to fry, remembers too many Hooray Henrys boozing with Harry and braying with Wills: not Mr Murdoch's natural choice of companion, y'know. And even the Mail - disinterring the Duke of Edinburgh's extramarital wanderings only a few days ago - has problems staying faithful. </p> <p>Here comes the Independent counter-attack on an ungrateful 'rural life only made possible by townie generosity'. They bray, we pay. Here comes Polly Toynbee in the Guardian taking an axe to these 'last hurrahs from a lost world'. You might suppose that too much heat had extinguished light. </p> <p>Which holds probably true for both high politics and low calculation. The TV violence didn't play well for the protesters. The sheer number of people who live in the country and hunt wouldn't keep a Fleet Street circulation manager warm through winter. The toff end of the press (with or without M'lord Conrad Black) isn't much good at 'speaking for Britain'. </p> <p>But excessive rage is counter-productive. Ms Toynbee, after all, went on to savage Labour as well. A Guardian leader worried about British opinion 'slow to anger but unafraid to strike'. The Mirror asked Blair to realise that once again 'he has got into a terrible mess'. </p> <p>Is it only 'them and us', then? Our readers right, their readers wrong? All those secretaries on the Atkins diet and retired sales directors in Guildford - the real gentry the Mail and Telegraph are landed with - wanting to take to the polo barricades, surrogate defenders of a life they can only imagine? If they'd only stop shouting for a second, they might be pleasantly surprised. That said, that is.</p>",
  "This is the England that is all but lost: thatched cottages nestling behind rose gardens, rattling tractors that clog the narrow lanes. Village shops which sell home-made meringues and apple pies instead of lotto cards and chewing gum. To a city-dweller who finds himself roaming the rolling fields of north Wiltshire, even the traditional red telephone boxes seem impossibly nostalgic. <p>The fields are populated not by cattle but groups of strutting horses, a clue that this is deep hunting territory. </p> <p>Yet scratch the quaintness and it soon becomes clear the shires are seething. Last Wednesday, when the Countryside Alliance held a 10,0000-strong protest in Parliament Square, something snapped in rural Britain. On the same day five men, who became known as the Ledbury Set after the region of ultra-rural England they hailed from, calmly walked into the Houses of Parliament and made it into the Commons chamber before being apprehended in a flurry of be-stockinged security guards. Hunting was back on the front pages. </p> <p>On Friday in Wiltshire the talk was of class war, betrayal and increasing retribution. Half the livelihoods in the area would be undermined by a ban on fox hunting, say residents. Everyone would know someone affected. Even the local radio station is called Fox FM. </p> <p>In the village of Badminton, the tension hung heavy last week. Outside the gates of the acclaimed Beaufort Hunt, supported by Prince Charles and close to the prestigious Beaufort Polo Club run by the parents of one of the protesters, Luke Tomlinson, stable hands mused darkly over why Tony Blair was so keen to 'persecute the country folk'. </p> <p>Wayne Lees recalled how those who had attended last week's demonstration in London wandered into his village shop the morning after. Most stopped to gaze at the morning papers, shaking their heads at the images of bleeding scalps of comrades as they were beaten back by the police. Some delicately tried to pick up a copy, but couldn't: their knuckles had been broken by police batons. </p> <p>'We'd always felt different, but the deal with Blair was that you leave us alone and we'll just carry on. It's just started,' said one who swore revenge and had an ugly purple welt running along a thin forearm to prove he had popped into Parliament Square last week. Similar stories, similar vows of retribution, echoed from village to village. </p> <p>People remembered how they volunteered to assist the government, helping to cull their animals during the foot-and-mouth crisis. Shopkeeper Wayne Lees, Bristol-born and still considered a townie after 12 years in Badminton, said: 'To take away something like this and replace it with nothing seems foolish.' And it is not just hunters staring into the abyss. A hunting ban would leave no one untouched, the impact rippling through the community - farriers, saddlers, grocers, post office, vets, the pub all affected. </p> <p>Evidence of its vital role is everywhere - from the rain-soaked notes offering horsebox repairs, to the pink slips advertising the next hunt. The Grant's family saddlery firm has stood hidden within the tight backstreets of Malmesbury, Wiltshire, for the past 70 years. An unremarkable facade, save for the crest of the Prince of Wales above the door. </p> <p>Grants and Son supply equipment to the Beaufort. Mainly, though, 'everyday folk' request \u00a3600 hand-made whips and cow-hide saddles. A hunting ban will mean a 75 per cent loss of income. </p> <p>Richard's son Harry, 16, wants to follow family tradition. That may never happen, creating another generation of angry souls certain to rail at the present government. The Grants may have the seal of royalty but in Blair's Britain their skill - saddlery requires a four-year apprenticeship - could see them winding up in the local job centres, or commuting to Bristol or Swindon to work in an office, or selling up and moving away from an area already suffering from a steady influx of those from 'upcountry' - house prices here have risen three-fold over the past decade. Malmesbury now stands on the verge of seeing its first \u00a31m property, with one townhouse currently on sale for \u00a3950,000. </p> <p>They are London prices for London people, the locals say, something for the metroplitan elite who, like Blair and his MPs, do not understand country ways. 'You do get the odd one coming down here and moaning about cow muck on the road, or dirt on their vintage sports car,' said local estate agent Keith Maslin. </p> <p>'Even I get, \"Where are you from?\"' said Maslin, born in Chippenham, 11 miles down the road and a resident of the village for 17 years. Close by in the Kings Arms Hotel, landlady Hilary Timms, a Liverpudlian, has watched with interest the resentment afforded to some incomers. 'The older people in particular don't like them.' </p> <p>Under the low ceilings of the Rattlebone Inn in Sherston, a former playground of Tomlinson along with Prince William and Harry, suspicion weighed heavily against those who had ventured from the metropolis in the wake of last Wednesday. Eventually The Observer was asked to leave. Comparable hostility greeted 'outsiders' in the Old Ship Inn in Luckington three miles down the road. Many predict already hard attitudes to city folk can only harden. 'What will it be next they they try and ban? Shooting? Fishing? Where will it end?' asked Barnes. </p> <p>Many townies though couldn't care what privileged rural folk lose. As Britain's cities fight increasing congestion and crime, weariness over subsidising the lifestyle of millions has never been higher. 'We live in a country where the taxes of city-dwellers subsidise the lifestyles of people in the country,' said Dr Simon Parker, Lecturer in Politics University of York and author of Urban Theory and the Urban Experience , who believes the motives of the Ledbury Set are as self-serving as their lifestyles suggest. </p> <p>'There are indeed pockets of rural deprivation, but that is not what this is about. These are extremely wealthy individuals and their retainers. They are trying to make out that they are representing people who have lost their buses and post offices.' </p> <p>But it will take more than Parker's indifference to deter Britain's new radicals. They are the new revolutionaries - dashing, charismatic young men, with impossibly good bone structure. But these latter-day Che Guevaras are not working class heroes. They are rural community heroes. </p> <p>The traditional radicals - anti-globalisation protestors and poll-tax rioters - all succeeded in bringing London to a halt. None though would dare enter the debating chamber of the Mother of Parliaments. But for their supporters on the libertarian, radical right, the five young 'musketeers' have become a potent touchstone for those prepared to fight for the principle of freedom. </p> <p>The past week will be remembered for one of the most audacious acts in Parliament's long history. It remains to be seen whether it will mark the death throes of an increasingly desperate cause or the beginning of a serious dissent movement whose connections run from royalty to the horsey set to terrier boys. The potential power of last week's Commons intruders cannot be ignored. </p> <p>Ever since his mother Lucy gestured him towards a foot high stack of newspapers following his release from prison before dawn on Friday, a devilish smile has played across the face of Otis Ferry, Britain's new pin-up. Still clad in the police-issue boiler suit he wore in prison, Otis had grabbed Luke Tomlinson, the close friend he shares with Prince William and Harry, and yelped: 'Look at us, look at the state of us.' Ferry has good looks that came direct from a model mother and a rock star father, Roxy Music singer Bryan. Even as he and his friends traipsed out of Charing Cross police station at 2am on Friday they looked more like they were stumbling from the annual rugby club dinner than men who'd endured a stretch behind bars. </p> <p>These though are rebels with a cause. And those who know them talk of a fierce, collective intellect honed towards a simple ideology: the preservation of a rural Britain and the tradition it stands for. Fox-hunting may have become their rallying call, but they are fighting to protect a Britain defined by warm beer. </p> <p>Certainly Otis was educated in the fineries of tradition. Lucy took him one misty November morning to the state opening of Parliament aged just five. Speaking to The Observer after her son was released, Lucy tellingly was aghast her son's actions had served to endanger yet another ancient ritual of Britain. </p> <p>'It would be a tragedy if those men in tights disappeared as a result, an absolute tragedy,' she said, referring to suggestions that it was time to overhaul the antiquated Parliamentary security systems. </p> <p>'Maybe we could arm them with machine guns, bring them up to date. But we cannnot destroy our historical riches. Those man make England different from, say, Spain, France, Germany. Without such heritage then cultures would just be the same.' </p> <p>The Ledbury Set, named after the corner of England including chunks of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and south Shropshire where the perpetrators of last week's stunt hail, is characterised by its cliquey-ness. Those welcomed into the small, monied south Herefordshire scene are soon embroiled in a merry-go-round of scandal, gossip and smut. </p> <p>They tend to stick by their own. One couple told how, shortly after moving into the area, they were invited to a dinner party and quickly introduced to a horsey woman clad head to foot in tweed. 'You must be the Pakistanis,' she said. 'What do you mean?' asked the newcomers. 'Anybody who hasn't lived here for 30 years is a Pakistani,' she explained. </p> <p>Members are graded by which shoot they belong and how many times they've popped over to Highgrove, the country home of Prince Charles. Bawdy behaviour and financial clout go hand in hand here. David Redvers is 34, and owns a stud in the Severn Vale near Gloucester; he was among those who gatecrashed Parliament. It is men like Redvers who have establised the Ledbury Set's reputation as a group of young, intelligent men who zealously hunt the hills close to the Welsh border. </p> <p>Others now added to that list are John Halliday, 37, who works the hounds at the Ledbury Hunt along with Robert Thame, another 30-something, who also plays polo with Prince Charles, Harry and William. Otis Ferry is believed to have become embroiled in the set after excelling as the youngest ever joint-master in UK history, in south Staffordshire. From there it is a short journey east to the bar of Ledbury's Feathers Hotel and from there again to north Wiltshire. Here Otis would meet Luke Tomlinson amid a backdrop of parties with the offspring of Gloucestershire and Wiltshire society. </p> <p>It remains unclear when breaching the Commons first became a serious proposition. Yet, increasingly it seems, the stunt cannot be dismissed as a jolly jape drawn up on the back of an envelope hours beforehand, as some of the men involved have claimed. Pro-hunt campaigners claim to have begun plotting while giving evidence during the committee stages. </p> <p>'We were in there for days, wandering about, weighing it up,' said a senior figure in the Real Countryside Alliance, the rebellious brother of the more sober Countryside Alliance. In the close-knit world of hunting it seems impossible that details of the plan failed to filter to those caught in the Commons..</p>",
  "A knife-wielding teenager dubbed The Slasher, sentenced to life last week for a series of violent attacks, was allowed to continue his reign of terror because youth justice professionals repeatedly refused to classify him as a risk to the public, The Observer has discovered. <p>Elias Cecchetti, who was arrested last year for stabbing a female jogger in a London park, was on an electronic tag at the time of the attack and had a string of convictions for violence, theft and drug possession. </p> <p>He was first identified as out of control in 2000, when his local council, Hackney, applied for an antisocial behaviour order. </p> <p>But social services sources have said that the local youth justice team - which comprises experts from the criminal justice, health and education system - said it was impossible to carry out an official risk-assessment on Cecchetti, as he had not been offending for long enough. </p> <p>Three years later, when he was imprisoned for the frenzied attack in the park, he was considered so dangerous by the Prison Service that he was sent to Woodhill high-security adult jail near Milton Keynes, even though he was only 15. Woodhill houses some of the most dangerous prisoners in the country. </p> <p>Hackney officials have admitted that they had been unwise to apply for an Asbo to curb Cecchetti's behaviour. Almost as soon as the order was issued in August 2001 the teenager was back within the criminal justice system. </p> <p>Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union Napo, said: 'It's essential that youth justice teams develop the culture of risk assessment without delay.' </p> <p>Cecchetti's case will lead to calls for a rethink of the use of Asbos to control juvenile criminals. One condition of the order was that Cecchetti should not carry a knife, a measure that was completely unenforceable. </p> <p>The council said it was unable to enforce the order because Cecchetti was not living at home in Hackney and committed many of his offences outside the area he was restricted from entering. </p> <p>'Elias's behaviour was nowhere near \"low-level\". The Asbo almost became an irrelevance compared to what he went on to do. It wasn't the right tool to deal with his behaviour,' said a spokeswoman for Hackney. </p> <p>The council initially applied for a five-year order covering the whole of the borough, but the court watered it down to two years, covering the area around Cecchetti's home. It was also felt inappropriate to identify the young man at the time. </p> <p>The council is bracing itself for serious criticism of its approach to Cecchetti, but Councillor Jamie Carswell said that no one agency should take the blame for the mistakes made in the case. </p> <p>'To exonerate his behaviour and say that it's the council, or the police or the courts' fault, because they should have done something, misses the point. This was a disturbed and violent man,' he said.</p>",
  "Twice this year I have found myself at the centre of media interest. First when I was on trial at the Old Bailey, charged under the Official Secrets Act because I revealed details of an American plan to bug the phones of delegates to the United Nations Security Council. <p>And now, six months on, it's happened again. Last week's Observer reported the formation of the Truth-Telling Coalition, a group of 'whistle-blowers' from several countries set up to offer support and advice to people like myself. I, like many others, found myself in possession of knowledge about something which was wrong and which the public had a right to know about but which I was prevented from revealing because of the laws, rules and regulations to which I was subject. </p> <p>What has to be understood is that most whistle-blowers are not natural activists - this one certainly wasn't. We usually work in anonymous jobs, far from the spotlight. We are not campaigners, or journalists, or wannabe celebrities, craving a platform. Our conscience tells us we have to reveal what we know. We do that, we blow the whistle and, overnight, the whole media circus descends on us. </p> <p>I'm writing biographically because what hit me, so powerfully, was how alone I felt after I had taken the decision to 'go public'. I'm not a politician; I don't have a well-organised PR machine to craft my every word. I'm just your average citizen who never expected to be in a situation remotely like this. I was incredibly lucky in that I had Liberty, the human rights group, backing me and it was able, to some extent, to 'manage' all the exposure I was receiving. But, nothing prepares you for doing an interview with Jeremy Paxman. </p> <p>So one reason for forming our Truth-Telling Coalition was to help people like me hold their lives together when the going gets tough and, honestly, it does. </p> <p>Working at GCHQ was a relatively easy, reliable job. As long as you always toe the 'party line', you are more or less guaranteed a job for life. An 'iron rice bowl', as the Chinese would say. It was therefore a huge decision I took which led to me being arrested, my house searched, being sacked and finally charged. </p> <p>The minute an article mentioned that a 28-year-old woman had been arrested, I felt as though I had a big sign on my forehead, marking me out. I kept a low profile, stayed at home a lot, many times with the curtains closed, and hoped that no one would find out where I lived. Any knock at the door would start my heart racing. </p> <p>One day, a friend decided to drop by unannounced. I hid in a windowless part of the house, not daring to open the door. It was only as I heard the familiar purr of her car engine that I peeked through the curtains and relaxed. For almost a year this went on. Sometimes I would relax to the extent that I tried to apply for a low-paying shop job, but I inevitably struggled with how to answer the employer's questions about my employment history. </p> <p>The boredom of doing nothing, of not being capable of doing anything because of the fear of exposure and the constant cycle of anxiety kept me in a frustrating and confidence-sapping limbo. My family and friends were there for me, but no one was in my shoes.I prayed with my whole being that I wouldn't be charged. In fact, everyone told me it would be sheer madness for them to charge me, but in November 2003, the call came. </p> <p>It's a call that will happen again, not to me, but to others who have taken a similar decision to mine. Whistle-blowers who have decided to speak out. </p> <p>I was talking about my own experiences to Daniel Ellsberg, the celebrated Vietnam War whistle-blower, earlier this month and it was out of our conversation that came the idea to set up the Truth-Telling Coalition. </p> <p>Daniel had invited me to attend a symposium on truth telling at the American University in Washington DC. It was during that visit that I met former FBI employees Coleen Rowley and Sibel Edmonds, Major Frank Grevil from the Danish intelligence community and others who have spoken out about the abuses, cover-ups and lies that our respective governments have peddled before and after the invasion of Iraq. </p> <p>We felt that in order to encourage more of our former colleagues to 'speak truth to power', we had to show that we were united and willing to support them. </p> <p>How does one judge when to break their oath of secrecy? For some people there is never a when. For them, breaking the Official Secrets Act or other secrecy laws is fundamentally wrong. I believe that is simplistic and na\u00efve. To take that position is to assume that our government representatives are always, without a shadow of a doubt, in the right; that they are always acting in our best interests, that they are always behaving in accordance with national and international law. I doubt that we have seen more examples than we have recently, that this is patently not true. And we are still kept in the dark as to what the Attorney General's full legal advice was before the war. What are they hiding from us? </p> <p>I had to accept that I would never be anonymous again. I still fear being recognised in the street, cringe at the thought of everyone knowing my name. Yet the fact that charges were dropped in February 2004 is, I believe, vindication enough that I did the right thing. Even more so now that Kofi Annan has stated that the war was illegal. </p> <p>Did I have a part to play in the dropping of the UN resolution sanctioning war? I do not know. However, I am at peace with myself that at the very least, a totally false and un-representative 'yes' vote did not happen, that the most dangerous precedent of a legal and legitimate 'pre-emptive war' was averted. </p> <p>I am not a natural activist, I am not a political animal, I do not enjoy confrontation, and I do not delight in high-octane political debate. I did not make my disclosure about the deceitful manipulation of the UN before the invasion of Iraq began in order to garner fame or fortune. I am just a very ordinary, concerned individual who could not sit back in silence while the leaders of the UK and the US plotted about 'shock and awe', about wiping out their former ally and client Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>It is not that I in any way sympathised with Saddam. How could I? The man was a murderous tyrant. My sympathies lie with the Iraqi people. </p> <p>I will only apologise to an Iraqi who lived under the reign of Saddam and was living in Iraq up to and during the invasion, and truly wanted to see the US and its allies come and drop bombs on his/her country. If there is such a person, I apologise unreservedly to them for hoping that my disclosure could have stopped the war. I am lucky never to have lived through the horror of the reign of a despot, or suffer under a decade of crippling sanctions, or watch as my country disintegrates. </p> <p>Most of us sitting here in the West are in the same position as me. Why, then, do we feel we have the God-given right to impose so much suffering and terror on another nation? </p> <p>The Iraqi people did not deserve Saddam, but we all know how the West propped him up for years. When will we learn that our continued meddling in other people's affairs inevitably comes back to haunt us? If we are going to do better in the 21st century, then surely some lessons from the 20th century should be of uppermost importance? The first step would be to uphold basic international rule of law, to set about reforming and restructuring the UN and to ensure that the interests of one nation do not override the security of another. </p> <p>There will never be anyone who could realistically champion the abolition of the intelligence services; therefore, secrecy laws will always be necessary in the protection of national security. Until we can have 100 per cent trust in our elected representatives, until we know for sure that the intelligence services are not going to abuse their position of power through the blanket of official secrets, we will surely continue to have decent, moral public servants who face that critical moment of overwhelming clarity of conscience - 'the truth must out'. </p> <p>I hope that our coalition will make it easier for people to speak out. Here in the UK we will be campaigning for a fundamental reform of the Official Secrets Act. It must be changed to distinguish between espionage breaches which genuinely endanger national security and public-spirited whistle-blowing. </p> <p>The government will tighten the noose, do all it can to 'cover up', as will the big corporations. But there will always be people willing to put their careers and liberty on the line in the pursuit of truth and justice. </p> <p>Readers wishing to know more about the Truth-Telling Coalition should go to <a href=\"http://www.truthtellingproject.org\">www.truthtellingproject.org</a></p>",
  "Dana deserves a medal for her services to Irish democracy. This might sound strange coming from an ardent secularist who believes in the absolute separation of church and state and who thinks fundamentalist Catholicism has cast a withering, reactionary shadow over Irish life since, and arguably before, independence. <p>The former Eurovision Song Contest winner certainly champions all the causes from which liberals and progressives have recoiled: opposition to divorce; insistence on an outright ban on abortion; promotion of Catholic family values; rolling back of European democratic imperatives over Irish law; the special position of the church in Irish society. None the less, Dana, now Rosemary Scallon, has demonstrated more political courage and stuck closer to her principles than the two major opposition parties. </p> <p>While she has made it clear from the outset that she would contest next month's presidential election, both Fine Gael and, depressing it is to say, Labour have run away from the battlefield. The reason for their diffidence is obvious: the overwhelming popularity of Mary McAleese, the current occupant of Aras an Uachtarain.</p> <p>No one, not even her liberal detractors back in 1997, would deny that President McAleese deserves a second term. Despite our misgivings about her own conservative Catholicism and her northern nationalist background, McAleese has remained true to the spirit of her election slogan of 'Building Bridges' seven years ago. </p> <p>She reached out to many sectors of society we once feared she would be alienated from. In defiance of her own church, she took communion in Dublin's Anglican cathedral; she has studiously played down her own views on abortion, contraception and divorce, not allowing her office to be used as a vehicle to reverse the small but significant gains for personal and sexual freedom in the 1990s. </p> <p>Nor has the president used her time in office to advance a traditional nationalist polity regarding Northern Ireland. In fact, she and her husband, Martin, have established quiet but important connections with working-class loyalists, including the UDA's South Belfast brigadier, Jackie McDonald. President McAleese knows more than most public figures in the republic about the importance of bringing that community in from the cold after almost a decade of demoralisation, factional infighting and social degeneration. </p> <p>All this suggests that McAleese has earned another seven years in the presidency, yet for the first time in a long time, I find myself agreeing with the controversialist/columnist Vincent Browne - the Irish people also deserve an electoral contest in October. Browne has been correct to excoriate both Fine Gael and Labour for shirking their democratic responsibilities. </p> <p>Labour, in particular, fear that they would suffer a reverse of the 1990 Mary Robinson presidential campaign, when her victory provided the platform for the party's greatest electoral performance two years later. This time around, Pat Rabbitte and his strategists worry that a hammering in the 2004 presidential poll would paint Labour in a losers' light and thus dent their chances of inflicting major damage on Fianna Fail in the next general election. Fine Gael's calculations are somewhat similar: Enda Kenny and his inner circle fear they, too, will be seriously injured if they collide with the McAleese juggernaut. Irish presidential elections do not lead to change in economic, social, northern or foreign policy. They do, however, set the tone for a nation. Mary Robinson's triumph presaged and even hastened the liberalisation of the republic during the 1990s. Mary McAleese's entry to Aras seven years later chimed perfectly with the south's new re-engagement with the north and the need to create a fresh an all-embracing cross-border project. </p> <p>If the current president's moderation while in office could be characterised as Catholic-lite, then Dana is offering the electorate the Real Thing. Many may find Rosemary Scallon's brand of religious conservatism alarmingly dogmatic. What you have to concede, though, is that this softly spoken, neatly groomed paradigm of traditional Irish Catholicism has displayed more guts in the build-up to the presidential campaign than most of the champions of liberalism and pluralism in the Republic. By running away from the electoral struggle, they are not only abdicating their democratic responsibilities, but Labour and Fine Gael risk being perceived by the voters as a bunch of chickens. </p> <p>Pat Rabbitte, meanwhile, is scheduled to launch Labour's Northern Ireland Forum group next month in Belfast. One thing the northern delegates need to make clear to the Labour Party leader is not to run away from taking on their Sinn Fein opponents. Labour's sister party, the SDLP, are in terminal decline in large part because of an unwillingness to challenge Sinn Fein in the north on issues ranging from the hijacking of the human-rights agenda to how the latter party is financed. Unless Labour, north and south, learn from the fatal errors of the SDLP and their self-destructive embrace and promotion of their lean and hungry rivals in the latter half the Nineties, Rabbitte's party is destined to suffer a similar fate. <br><br><a href=\"mailto:henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk\">henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Tony Blair postponed a vote in the House of Commons to legalise gay marriages to placate the born-again Christian preacher and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Ian Paisley. <p>The second reading of the Civil Partnerships bill was scheduled to be voted on in Parliament last Thursday. However, Paisley asked the Prime Minister to put the vote off because all six DUP MPs would be at the talks in Leeds Castle, Kent, aimed at restoring devolution in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Blair's decision showed the importance he attaches to the role of the DUP in the Northern Ireland peace process. The party now has the largest number of MPs and members of the Northern Ireland Assembly in the province. </p> <p>Paisley called Blair last Friday and pointed out that he and his fellow MPs were determined to vote on the gay marriage legislation but would be unable to do so due to their commitments at Leeds Castle. </p> <p>Paisley's son, also called Ian, last night confirmed that his father had persuaded the Prime Minister to delay the second reading of the bill. </p> <p>'My dad rang Downing Street last weekend and told the Prime Minister that the six DUP MPs would be unable to vote on the bill,' he said. 'The Prime Minister agreed to postpone business until another date.' </p> <p>Paisley Sr is the leader of the fundamentalist Free Presbyterian Church as well as chief of Northern Ireland's largest political party. He is resolutely opposed to gay relationships and all his MPs were planning to vote against the Civil Partnership bill. </p> <p>Paisley has led several public campaigns against gay rights in Northern Ireland, including his 'Save Ulster From Sodomy' crusade of 1981, when he opposed the British government's move to lower the age of consent for gay sex from 21 to 18.</p>",
  "<p>Drugs charities have accused the government of abandoning plans to set up a network of doctors prescribing pure heroin to addicts. </p> <p>Two years ago, the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, announced that the number of licences issued to GPs entitled to prescribe heroin should be increased from less than 50 to 1,500 in an attempt to take the supply of the drug out of the hands of criminals. </p> <p>The move was applauded by drugs organisations, which said the use of medical heroin - known as diamorphine - would help addicts control their chaotic lifestyle and stop them being sucked into crime to support their habit. </p> <p>But new Home Office figures show that the number of prescribing doctors has barely doubled. The National Treatment Agency, the government body responsible for dealing with addiction, confirmed that, by March of this year, only 123 doctors were licenced to prescribe medical heroin. </p> <p>The majority of Britain's GPs see at least one addict a month and a quarter treat heroin or cocaine addicts, but only a tiny minority are able to use heroin itself during treatment and most use the heroin substitute methadone. </p> <p>The charity Drugscope said that the move towards prescribing heroin was derailed by the publicity surrounding Harold Shipman, the GP who murdered at least 215 of his patients using diamorphine. Shipman was jailed for life in 2000, but the inquiry into the case, led by Dame Janet Smith, has had a lasting impact on the medical profession. </p> <p>Smith's fourth report, published in July, called for stricter controls to avoid the kind of stockpiling that allowed Shipman to build up his supply. </p> <p>The debate over prescribing will be severely tested later this year by the investigation by the General Medical Council into seven doctors at the Stapleford clinic, a private treatment centre for addicts. The six men and one woman worked in centres in Belgravia, London and Stapleford Tawney, Essex and are charged with 'excessive and improper' prescribing. </p> <p>The centre is alleged to have kept patients on lengthy courses of methadone, rather than cutting the supply sharply as recommended by NHS guide lines. The defendants include Dr Colin Brewer, the founder of the centre, who is recognised as an international expert in the field. </p> <p>The plans to set up the network of prescribing GPs came after a Home Affairs Select Committee report found that drug misuse by Britain's 250,000 heroin addicts was fuelling drug crime worth \u00a320 billion a year. The committee also recommended establishing safe 'shooting galleries' for addicts. But these have also failed to take off after councils failed to persuade residents that they would encourage addicts off the streets. </p> <p>Drugscope spokeswoman Natasha Vromen said: 'These figures are disappointing. There were great hopes that the government and doctors were developing a drugs policy where the health aspects were brought to the fore. Unfortunately, it is now dominated by the crime agenda.'</p>",
  "Tony Blair was last night forced on to the defensive over Iraq after explosive leaked documents revealed that he was warned a year before the invasion that a war could send the country into meltdown. <p>The Prime Minister was advised by officials that the country risked 'reverting to type' - with a succession of military coups installing a dictator who could then go on to acquire his own weapons of mass destruction - and that British troops would be trapped in Iraq 'for many years'. </p> <p>Even his own foreign policy adviser, Sir David Manning, concluded in a private note that President Bush had no answer to the big questions about the invasion - including 'what happens on the morning after?' The memos, showing how detailed military planning was even a year before the invasion, will prompt renewed questions about whether better planning for the aftermath of war could have prevented the bloodshed now engulfing Iraq. </p> <p>The highly confidential papers represent one of the most serious leaks Downing Street has ever had to confront - both because of the extremely restricted nature of their circulation and the embarrassment they may cause senior US figures named in the memos - and will prompt a major Whitehall mole hunt. Last night speculation was focusing on the Butler inquiry into the intelligence gathered in Iraq, which was given thousands of confidential documents detailing the run-up to war. </p> <p>While Downing Street normally refuses to comment on leaked documents, Blair yesterday took the unusual step of coming out fighting. 'The idea that we did not have a plan for afterwards is simply not correct,' he said. 'We did and we have unfolded that plan, but there are people in Iraq who were determined to stop us.' </p> <p>The Foreign Office, meanwhile, insisted in a statement that it was unsurprising that it had been engaged in detailed planning on Iraq two and a half years ago. </p> <p>Yesterday Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said the leaks were devastating: 'WMD was a cover for a determination towards regime change and that was known and understood 12 months before military action was taken. [Foreign Secretary] Jack Straw and others were warning that there was no way of predicting the consequences if Saddam Hussein was removed.' </p> <p>Tory Michael Ancram accused Blair and Straw of giving assurances about reconstruction planning which had been 'clearly misleading'. </p> <p>The most damaging passages concern British officials' widespread scepticism about the US case for invading, with one Cabinet Office briefing paper citing the success of the Afghanistan invasion, distrust of the UN and 'unfinished business from 1991' as factors. </p> <p>The documents flatter the Foreign Office, suggesting it accurately foresaw many of the problems now engulfing Iraq - plus some that never transpired, such as the imposition of a 'Sunni strongman' after a coup. Donald Anderson, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, yesterday praised Straw's 'great prescience'. </p> <p>Suspicions that friends of Straw leaked the papers, however, seem unlikely, since some correspondence - such as Manning's note to Blair - is unlikely to have been seen by anyone outside Downing Street, while other memos originate from the Cabinet Office. </p> <p>They do, however, all appear to date from March 2002, a period of intense diplomatic activity ahead of Bush and Blair's April summit at the President's ranch in Crawford, and the Cabinet Office memo at least is known to have been shown to the Butler team. That will increase suspicions that the weak link is somewhere from the Whitehall officials collating evidence for Butler, to the secretariat serving him, to the five-man inquiry panel itself. </p> <p>The first leaked paper is a briefing for Blair on 8 March, three days ahead of a meeting he was due to have with US Vice-President Dick Cheney, from the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat. Warning that the US 'has lost confidence in containment', it lists reasons the US now wants to invade, concluding starkly that there was no legal justification for military force: 'Subject to law officers' advice, none currently exists.' </p> <p>This exposes the difficulties Blair faced in persuading the US at least to try for a second UN resolution - and confirms the messy route to a ruling from the Attorney-General that war was legal, outlined by Butler. </p> <p>It also warns Blair had to make a decision about an invasion then expected in autumn 2002 - eventually deferred to spring - 'six months in advance'. </p> <p>This will be seized on by anti-war MPs to argue that while in public Blair was talking up diplomacy, in fact he had already decided to invade. However, Downing Street itself has suggested in the past it was hoping for the best while planning for the worst: the memo suggests no decision had been made. </p> <p>The next significant memo is from Manning to Blair, describing how he told US National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice that 'if we pursued regime change, it must be very carefully done'. </p> <p>Critics will say that shows while the Government was publicly insisting its aim was not regime change but tackling WMD, in private there was no pretence. Manning adds Bush still lacked answers to questions including 'what happens on the morning after?'. </p> <p>The memos confirm long-held suspicions that Britain's role was to try to minimise the fallout from a military invasion that the US was determined to mount. Manning's note concludes there was 'a real risk that the Administration underestimates the difficulties'. </p> <p>Then on 25 March came Straw's letter, predicting that the Crawford summit would be high-risk and pushing for arms inspectors to be allowed back into Iraq. He added that there was 'a larger hole than anything' in the question of what the war was meant to achieve - a question being asked more urgently now, given the Iraq Survey Group's failure to find WMD.</p>",
  "The British Army is to start pulling troops out of Iraq next month despite the deteriorating security situation in much of the country, The Observer has learnt. <p>The main British combat force in Iraq, about 5,000-strong, will be reduced by around a third by the end of October during a routine rotation of units. </p> <p>The news came amid another day of mayhem in Iraq, which saw a suicide bomber kill at least 23 people and injure 53 in the northern city of Kirkuk. The victims were queueing to join Iraq's National Guard. </p> <p>More than 200 people were killed last week in one of the bloodiest weeks since last year's invasion, strengthening impressions that the country is spinning out of control. </p> <p>Yesterday grim footage apparently showing a British engineer kidnapped from a house in Baghdad last week along with two American colleagues surfaced in a video released in the Iraqi capital. The group holding the three threatened to execute them unless Iraqi women prisoners are released from jail. </p> <p>And last night it was reported that 10 more staff working for an American-Turkish company had been seized as hostages. </p> <p>There are now fears that scheduled Iraqi elections in January will have to be delayed because of the growing instability. </p> <p>Last week Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, said that more troops could be sent to safeguard the polls if necessary, although Whitehall sources said there was no guarantee that they would be British. </p> <p>The forthcoming 'drawdown' of British troops in Basra has not been made public and is likely to provoke consternation in both Washington and Baghdad. Many in Iraq argue that more, not fewer, troops are needed. Last week British troops in Basra fought fierce battles with Shia militia groups. </p> <p>The reduction will take place when the First Mechanised Infantry Brigade is replaced by the Fourth Armoured Division, now based in Germany, in a routine rotation over the next few weeks. </p> <p>Troop numbers are being finalised, but, military sources in Iraq and in Whitehall say, they are likely to be 'substantially less' than the current total in Basra: the new combat brigade will have five or even four battle groups, against its current strength of six battle groups of around 800 men. </p> <p>A military spokesman in Basra confirmed the scaling back of the British commitment. </p> <p>Currently there are 8,000 British troops in the 14,000-strong 'multinational division' in southern Iraq, which has responsibility for about 4.5 million people. </p> <p>The cuts will occur in the combat elements of the deployment - the 5,000-strong infantry and armoured brigade that is committed to the provinces of Basra and Maysan. Four Royal Navy ships will remain in the Gulf. </p> <p>However, the incoming force will leave its heavy armour, mainly Challenger tanks, behind, but will be equipped with a unit of Warrior armoured troop carriers. </p> <p>Senior officers say the scaling back of the British commitment in Iraq is a sign of their success in keeping order and helping reconstruction. But both Basra and Maysan have seen heavy combat recently, with some units sustaining up to 35 per cent casualties, and remains restive. The al-Mahdi army, which was responsible for most of the fighting, remains heavily armed. </p> <p>'Whatever they say, fewer troops mean less capability,' a military expert told The Observer . 'You need as many boots on the ground as you can get for low-intensity warfare and peace-keeping operations.' </p> <p>Iyad Allawi, the interim Iraqi Prime Minister, will hold talks with Tony Blair at Chequers tomorrow on security issues, including elections and the strengthening of border patrols. </p> <p>News of the troop withdrawal comes at a difficult time for Blair, with the publication yesterday of leaked documents suggesting that he was warned a year before the invasion that it could prompt a meltdown. </p> <p>However Tessa Jowell, the Culture Secretary and a close ally of Blair, told The Observer that the Prime Minister still believed that Britain's actions would be justified by the restoration of democracy 'however difficult and remote a prospect that seems at the moment, when our headlines are crowded with further attacks by the insurgents'. </p> <p>In another embarrassment for the Prime Minister, a draft report from the Iraqi Survey Group, set up to investigate Saddam Hussein's weapons programme, has concluded that the former dictator's only chemical or biological armament was a small amount of poison for use in political killings.</p>",
  "Another day, another few dozen deaths in Iraq, this time in the northern city of Kirkuk, where a car bomb, the third last week, blew up a crowd of people waiting to apply for jobs with the new Iraqi security forces, killing 20. <p>It wasn't meant to be this way. The handover of sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government in June was supposed to stop the violence. Instead the last days have seen some of the worst carnage since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. US intelligence services now predict, at best, instability and poverty for the foreseeable future, at worst, violent anarchy by the end of next year. Politicians in London, Washington and Baghdad disagree. Things will get better, they insist. </p> <p>So what is the truth? How bad is the situation? Are there any positive signs? Just what does the future hold for Iraq? </p> <p>Once the road, from Baghdad airport ran between rows of slender date palms. Now the trees are gone, stripped out to deny cover to insurgents. Though squads of the new Iraqi National Guard, the local security militia founded and trained by the now defunct coalition authorities, loiter in the dusty scrub along its verges and American troops roll along the pitted tarmac in their armoured, air-condi tioned Humvee Jeeps, the road is still one of the most dangerous in the country. The shuttle bus driver ferrying passengers to the renovated terminal yells at anyone who uses a mobile phone in case they trigger a roadside bomb. Vehicles weave to avoid snipers on bridges. </p> <p>On one side is Camp Victory - the huge headquarters of the 140,000 American soldiers in Iraq - with its vast truck parks, ranks of armoured vehicles, 24- hour 'chow halls', prison and rows of trailer cabins. Opposite are the suburbs of western Baghdad: dirt poor, rubbish- strewn and violent. Beyond them lie the Sunni Muslim-dominated badlands around Falluja and Ramadi, now totally beyond the control of either the new Iraqi government or the Americans. </p> <p>The scene appears to epitomise all that is wrong with Iraq. The Americans hunkered down in their bases, bandit country beyond the blast walls, and weak and uncertain Iraqi authorities with no authority in their own land. </p> <p>But, as you head into the centre of the Baghdad, things change. Traffic builds up. If it is evening, restaurants in wealthy suburbs such as Karada and Mansoor are busy. Despite the risks, peo ple sit out on the pavement drinking tea. Shop windows are full of expensive consumer goods. Bizarrely, drive through most of Baghdad and there is little on the surface, other than the concrete barriers and barbed wire around government buildings and the occasional dull thump of an explosion in the distance, that distinguishes it from any other scruffy, parched, poor Middle Eastern city. </p> <p>Analyses tend to veer to extremes - the country is on the brink of anarchy, elections scheduled for January will bring success and stability, the country has risen up against the occupation, the government is popular. The truth is more complex, a mix of some good and much that is very bad, of the mundane, the horrific and extraordinary. It is the story of people trying to lead normal lives in a world turned upside down. </p> <p>In the high-ceilinged lounge of her old, ivy-strewn house in Karada, Nawar Sahhar, 49, rearranges the rosaries around a faded picture of Christ. There have been reports that widespread persecution is forcing Iraqi Christians to leave, but Sahhar says she get on with all her neighbours, 'Shia, Sunni, whoever.' </p> <p>She does want to leave Iraq but not for fear of sectarian violence. She wants treatment for her severely disabled daughters, aged 13 and 10, and 'a better life'. Her litany of problems is familiar to almost all Iraqis: her husband has not worked for five months, food costs have rocketed, electricity and clean water are still scarce and, above all, there is 'no security'. </p> <p>'I was so happy when the US came. We had no freedom under Saddam,' she said. 'But we are so scared now we have no freedom either.' </p> <p>In fact, though there is more fighting between insurgents and US troops, many Iraqis say that their personal security has improved, albeit marginally, in the past six months in much of Baghdad. In addition, electricity is available four out of every six hours instead of two, and salaries - for those with jobs - have increased. But the pace of progress is so slow that, even in the better areas, such minor improvements go unnoticed and large parts of the city are yet to experience any significant change since the invasion last year. </p> <p>Security and reconstruction, everyone agrees, go together. Both Sunni and Shia militants said lack of progress on basic utilities was critical to their decision to fight. Sadr City, the northern slum district where around two million poor Shias live, has seen fierce battles in recent weeks. </p> <p>'They promised us everything and gave us dirt,' said Khalid Hadu, a Shia fighter who was a soldier until the controversial demobilisation of the army last year. The 23-year-old, speaking in the ruined centre of the shrine city of Najaf during fighting last month, was there to 'fight the occupation'. Sunni militants agree. 'It's a matter of pride. We were deceived,' one told The Observer . </p> <p>But reconstruction, entrusted by Washington to around 15 leading American companies, relies on foreign investment and expertise. And the threat to foreigners in Iraq is currently higher than it has ever been. </p> <p>Mahmudiya is a scruffy town in dessicated farmland just south of Baghdad. It lies across the main road south and is one of the most dangerous spots for foreigners in Iraq. The local Sunni tribes were heavily influenced by radically conservative strands of Islam imported by Saudi Arabian clerics, and gangs of insurgents and criminals cruise the streets looking for Westerners to kill or kidnap. Reporters drive through at dawn in fast, nondescript cars, lying on the back seats with their fingers crossed. </p> <p>Not all get through. Two French journalists were seized here last month. Dozens of Arab truck drivers were also captured. Several have been decapitated. A major operation by the Iraqi police and the American army two weeks ago has had no obvious impact. </p> <p>It is hard to identify the kidnappers. They include radical Islamic groups aiming to strike a blow against the 'Crusaders', nationalist insurgents looking to disrupt reconstruction, and gangsters. 'This is a fluid situation no one has a handle on,' said one security expert. </p> <p>The 'resistance' is equally diverse. According to their intelligence officers, the British army in the south of Iraq faces four threats: 'former regime loyalists', the Shia al-Mahdi militia, al-Qaeda or affiliates, and criminals. </p> <p>In Basra, where the British are still broadly popular, the numbers involved in violence are small. Though highly professional, the former Baathists may be only a few score strong. Military intelligence estimates that the Mahdi army, which fought bitter battles in August and wounded a soldier on Friday night, may number less than 500. And there are no more than a handful of Islamist militants linked to groups such as that of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian-born jihadi operating out of the militant-run enclaves further north. Then there are smugglers - of oil, arms, people and drugs. Resistance leaders said there was little co-operation between the groups. </p> <p>But any one problem - such as the continuing disruption of the oil supply around Basra - can be the result of the uncoordinated efforts of many different actors. Thieves steal copper power cables, local tribes destroy the lines that funnel electricity generated locally to the north, former Baathists hit pipelines. The whole situation is confused by the new Iraqi Ministry of Oil releasing, wittingly or otherwise, erroneous figures which, by indicating less supply, drive up world oil prices. As ever in Iraq, nothing is quite what it seems. Simple analyses - and simple solutions -don't work. </p> <p>For three weeks in August, Najaf was a war zone. Apache helicopters blasted volleys of missiles into positions held by Mahdi militia around the holy shrine. Tanks and snipers battled their way through narrow, rubble-strewn streets. The Americans lost 14 men, the militia five times as many. Dozens of civilians died. A truce brokered by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most senior Shia cleric in Iraq, brought a tenuous peace, but the conflict was left unresolved. </p> <p>Last week American jets struck a series of targets in Falluja. They were 'al-Zarqawi safehouses', they said. Arabic-language satellite TV channels broadcast footage of hospitals filled with casualties, many clearly non-combatants. Falluja and several nearby towns are currently run by local tribal sheikhs, continuing a long tradition of resistance to central rule, in alliance with Islamist radicals. Much of the northern city of Mosul, the towns of Samarra and Baquba, are also contested. That situation remains unresolved too. </p> <p>Mouwaffaq al-Rubaie, the new Iraqi national security adviser, told The Observer that 'no armed militia' could exist in 'the new democratic, federal Iraq. If there are problems, let's talk about them. But they must put down their guns,' he said. But the timetable is less certain: 'Your guess is as bad as mine.' </p> <p>But time is running out. The elections scheduled for January are critical. 'We need a legitimate, representative adminstration here,' said one Western diplomat in Baghdad. 'Otherwise we're going to hell in a handcart.' </p> <p>Senior figures in the Mahdi army indicated to The Observer that they might join the electoral process. 'We want to be in the new Iraq and help its people', said one. Shias comprise at least 60 per cent of the Iraqi population, so have a strong interest in elections going ahead. </p> <p>But the Sunnis - or at least the minority who actively back the insurgents - will be harder to bring 'into the tent'. They comprise 15 to 20 per cent of Iraq's 25 million and, as Iraq's former elite, have far more to lose. With Iraq voting en masse for a single card of candidates, not by individual constituencies, it would be possible to go ahead with an election even if Falluja and other resistance enclaves are outside government control. Prime Minister Iyad Allawi says he will not let 300,000 people in the Sunni triangle hold up national polls. But the key will be the views of the Iraqi people. </p> <p>Hundreds of conversations with Iraqis - from senior ministers to beggars - reveal that most Iraqis are very pleased Saddam has gone, don't like the Americans' presence, don't like the insurgents much either, and are prepared to give Allawi and his government a chance. They want elections, better provision of basic utilities and an end to violence. They believe Islam has an important role to play in their identity and do not want their country split into independent ethnic or religious blocs. There is, as anywhere, a wide range of political views. During the battles in Najaf, some local people brought water to the Americans and the government forces; others were angry at all the combatants; some were angry at Allawi - 'Bush's dog, Blair's puppy', one shopkeeper called him. </p> <p>American diplomats claim that Iraq has been handed back to the Iraqis. This isn't entirely true, at least where policies directly affect security and US military operations. An amnesty offered by Allawi to insurgents was diluted under pressure from the US until it was meaningless. And the new Prime Minister seems unable, or unwilling, to end the air strikes that have so far failed to kill many militants and have enraged the local populace. </p> <p>But the lineaments of a new nation are emerging. Ironically, much of it looks like Saddam's Iraq, though without the systematic repression. Appalling bureaucracy is back, along with rabid graft. 'The smell of corruption is overwhelming,' said a senior adviser at the Ministry of Oil. The new police see their job as maintaining order - in a brutal, often lethal fashion - not protecting citizens against crime. The government has responded harshly to media criticism, closing the offices of al-Jazeera and harassing journalists. Allawi has even created a secret intelligence service and talked of 'emergency powers' to counter violence. All of this confirms a pre-war memorandum to Tony Blair from senior UK government advisers, revealed last week, pointing out there was no certainty that any 'replacement regime' in Iraq 'will be any better' [than Saddam's]. The memo even raised the possibility of a new government seeking weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>Much of this is very popular with Iraqis. One Baghdad-based businessman said he wanted to see criminals executed in public. Ali Kathmi Kathm, a teacher in Kufa, said Allawi was 'the strong man' Iraq needs. 'For so long everything was settled by violence here. Iraqis only understand force,' he said. The British memo warns that 'Iraq has no history of democracy, so no one has this habit'. </p> <p>So what does the future hold? The pre-war neo-con vision of a prosperous and stable pro-Western democracy in the heart of the Middle East is in tatters. The issue now is salvaging something from the mess. Oddly, what is likely to be salvaged, slowly and painfully, is perhaps the only thing that would have worked in the first place. The state that is evolving is unlikely to be a particularly pleasant - or even pro-Western - one. </p> <p>Every one of the concessions to the insurgents that are the only way to build a national consensus will take the new Iraq away from the idea imagined by those who launched the war. But any US attempt to interfere will backfire horribly, plunging the country into the total chaos that has so far, just, been avoided. A catastrophic collapse is unlikely. Instead, Iraq is likely stagger on, amid much bloodshed and pain, into an uncertain, unstable and harsh future. </p> <p>For ordinary people such as Sahhar there is only one thing to do: 'I hope, I hope, I hope. Every day, I hope harder.' </p> <p><b> And what will happen next?</b> </p> <p>The Observer asked three foreign affairs experts, Charles Pena of the Cato Institute in Washington; Yahia Said of the London School of Economics and Daniel Neep of the Royal United Services Institute in London</p> <p><b>Should the US pull its troops out?</b></p> <p><b>Charles Pena </b> <br>There is a good argument that if you remove foreign occupiers you remove the justification for some of the insurgency. But the insurgents are not all motivated by the same thing and violence will continue. The removal of the regime left a political vacuum. The problem is there is an internal struggle for control in Iraq and the US military are part of the problem. </p> <p><b> Yahi Said</b> <br>The American military have become part of the problem. They are a threat themselves [to Iraqis' physical safety], they are a magnet for Islamic extremists from all over the world and every time an American soldier at a checkpoint or in a prison abuses someone they feed the insurgency. Their presence is a legitimising factor for [the Iraqi resistance]. It depends on how they pull out. Their withdrawal is one of the few avenues left now to break the spiral of violence. But it has to be at the request of the Iraqi government. If they leave unilaterally then that would be counter-productive. [Prime Minister Iyad] Allawi can break the dynamic by setting a timetable for coalition withdrawal. </p> <p><b> Daniel Neep</b> <br>It is swings and roundabouts. The US presence causes some problems, but removing the US military will not remove all grounds for complaint and there will just be fewer people available to deal with [the situation]. There are a whole host of reasons for the violence - economic and social frustration, the trauma of 30 years of war and dictatorship. Violence has become a normal part of political behaviour. It is now instinctive, pathological not political. </p> <p><b>Is there going to be a civil war?</b></p> <p><b> Charles Pena</b><br>What we have at the moment certainly looks like a civil war. </p> <p><b>Yahia Said </b> <br>Iraq is in civil war, though ethnic and sectarian violence is not on the cards. Security is misunderstood by the US and by [Prime Minister] Iyad Allawi. Security is legitimacy. However many US or Iraqi forces you have, you can never pacify the country by force. </p> <p><b> Danile Neep </b><br>A division into warring ethnic and religious blocks is unlikely but there is already chaotic fighting and the possibility for it to worsen. </p> <p><b>Are flawed elections better than none?</b></p> <p><b> Charles Pena </b> <br>You have to pick your poison. A flawed election will mean that the Iraqi people will not recognise the election result. But a postponement might lead to the Shia community opting out of the political process. We should have the election and then get out. It is going to be ugly. </p> <p><b> Yahia Said </b><br>The major factor behind the violence is the government's lack of legitmacy. Any legitimacy is better than none. But it must be a national election. </p> <p><b> Daniel Neep </b> <br>The election needs to go ahead, even if the process is flawed. At least it might be the beginning of something better. After all, the Iraqis are more interested in having a broadly representative government than one that meets some set of imagined standards. But there has to be some kind of concession to the insurgents. The state is simply not strong enough to marginalise anyone totally.</p>",
  "Last week the government announced its intention to raise income tax by up to two pence in the pound, a move that the opposition parties are also having to confront. It was an important moment in British politics. At long last a truth is becoming sayable - we have to pay for the benefits we want to enjoy. <p>Some readers will be saying they recall no such announcement and that this columnist has clearly taken leave of his senses. It is true that the collective intent of the three parties was well disguised, but when Alan Johnson, the new Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, announced in his speech to the TUC last week that he would not be lifting the retirement age for eligibility for the state pension, the issue was sealed. </p> <p>The undeniable economic and political logic of his position is to imply an increase in income tax to pay for the consequent increase in the cost of the state pension, a logic that Adair Turner, the chairman of the government's pensions commission, will lay out in exquisite and forceful detail in the interim report on the issue he will present in mid-October. </p> <p>Johnson will have already felt the full private wrath of the Treasury, now letting it be known that Mr Turner has exceeded his brief, trying pre-emptively to draw the sting from his report. Turner, the former director-general of the CBI and general policy factotum, is not deliberately trying to be awkward. His trouble is that he is honest. From what I know of the report, it will be pitiless in its thinking, a long overdue intervention after two decades of dissimulation. </p> <p>He has been helped enormously by the parallel hard thinking of David Willetts, the Conservative's spokesman on work and pensions. He was among the first to recognise the unsustainability of Britain's current pension policy; that a country in which four-fifths of pensioners receive their pension conditional on their poverty is not only an affront but economically irrational, because there is no more effective deterrent to saving. </p> <p>His answer is to re-establish the state pension as a basic universal entitlement, to upgrade it in line with the rise in earnings and to pay for it by a combination of consolidating means-tested pensions into the state pension and raising the retirement age, deferring for perhaps a few years the moment when we will have to pay more taxes. </p> <p>To understand why tax rises are inevitable we have to return to Turner's report. It will begin by laying out what lower fertility and longer life expectancy are doing to the structure of our population. There will be progressively fewer workers producing the GDP out of which more and more pensioners will be drawing their pensions. At the moment there are nearly four workers supporting one pensioner; by 2050 there will be only two. Even if there is a remarkable increase in fertility and a surge in immigration so the population grows by a quarter to more than 80 million by 2050 - which it won't and can't - the numbers of workers supporting each pensioner would still drop to three. </p> <p>Turner is uncompromising. There are only three ways out of this conundrum for the state pension. First, we have to raise the retirement age to keep the costs under control; second, the average pension has to fall to do the same thing; third, taxes have to rise to maintain the pension's purchasing power. Mr Johnson has now ruled out the first option; the second is increasingly difficult politically. Which leaves with us with the last option. </p> <p>'Ha!' comes the retort from politicians. We can hold the line if we ask people to save more. But, as Turner says, the basic equation still doesn't change. We know the ratio of workers to pensioners is set to halve. When today's savers come to sell their bonds and shares in order to buy their pension annuities, the only buyers will be the next working generation, who will have halved in number in relation to pensioners. </p> <p>As Turner patiently explains, unless the next generation increase their savings by much more than we have, share prices and bond prices must fall - and privately funded pensions will fall in value as well. Pensions in an ageing society with a dwindling workforce is a problem that we all face and which can only be solved collectively. </p> <p>Turner will set another hare running by asking for a fair deal between the generations. What Alan Johnson is doing by declaring that today's generation can retire at 65 is to require today's workers to pay the consequent higher taxes. Those workers will almost certainly have to retire later themselves - a supreme policy of selfishness. And what's more, many of today's workers in the private sector are working to create profits to pay off the pension-fund deficits to support generous, guaranteed, so-called defined benefit pensions for yesterday's workforce. </p> <p>Many of the delegates at last week's TUC conference seemed to think this was just dandy. They thought that today's employers and employees should put their own prosperity at risk by being compelled to top up pension-fund deficits that have resulted from yesterday's pension promises being ridiculously generous, given the collapse in both share prices and interest rates. </p> <p>Pensions are paid from annuities that are invested in long-term bonds; if the returns from long-term bonds were to rise by 1 per cent from today's levels, most defined benefit pension funds would swing into surplus; if they fell by 1.5 per cent, about a third of our top companies would be technically bankrupt. </p> <p>The way out of this trap is not to lock individual companies into the swings of the capital markets and, thus, potential receivership - the self-defeating policy of the unions and, apparently, Alan Johnson. The solution is to socialise the problem through the government issuing bonds that offer sufficiently high returns to keep pension funds solvent - the policy proposed, embarrassingly for the left, by David Willetts with his 'longevity bonds'. As we are all unexpectedly living longer with unexpectedly fewer workers in a world of unexpectedly lower investment returns, his proposition is that the government should issue high- interest bonds underwritten by everyone to bail out distressed pension funds. </p> <p>All these proposals, though, involve a cost. There isn't a bag of swag in the private sector which can be raided, and there is no free lunch. There are only least bad ways out of the mess, and if we don't want to work longer or accept lower pensions, then we must pay higher taxes. </p> <p>Some of us have been saying this for longer than we care to remember. Willetts and Turner, though, are finally opening the national debate up in ways that are unanswerable. Good for them. Let us hope that this time somebody is listening.</p>",
  "<p>No matter how many years in journalism you have under your belt, you can't watch scenes like those at Beslan without being disturbed and sickened. The children looked as terrified as our own kids would be. The school hall with its basketball hoops could be anywhere in Britain. </p> <p>The pictures on screen as the story unfolded were, without doubt, hard to stomach. The anguish of waiting parents, the chaos once the shooting began, the pain of futile searches and the funerals. Journalistic detachment can't - and shouldn't - make you immune to the personal tragedies involved. </p> <p>There are tough questions for our business to ask itself about the duties and responsibilities of rolling news in times of great personal drama. Our part of the trade is different because of its immediacy and impact. When does live reporting become intrusion? </p> <p>How do you protect your viewers from being turned into voyeurs? How do you balance the right to witness momentous events against the danger of playing the terrorists' game? </p> <p>One problem is that almost everyone has a different point at which they would draw the line. After Beslan some commentators, particularly Peter Conrad in this newspaper last week, have rubbished the whole idea of live news and the 'see it as it happens' approach. For them, news only has value if it can be polished up, neatly packaged and put in context after a few hours' reflection. This is, effectively, what happened until 20 years ago when CNN and then Sky News came on the scene. </p> <p>Others have suggested that no footage shot by terrorists should be shown or that there should be some sort of committee of senior journalists to agree what limited coverage to show on all channels. </p> <p>I can understand the temptation to follow this route but I believe it would be wrong. Rolling television news, for all its rawness, does provide a window on the real world that other media can't match. The 11 September attacks, the week of Diana's death and funeral, the Omagh bombing, the Afghan and Iraq wars, the Kosovo conflict, the D-Day anniversary, the royal jubilee celebrations, this week's foxhunting demos - all have shown the value of live, continuous coverage. Viewers switch on in their millions to watch it unfold. They tell us they want it and surveys show they trust it. </p> <p>But remember this: no one in rolling news has ever claimed that it's a one-stop replacement for other media. News channels do provide analysis, explanation and a range of opinion but we accept that anyone wanting to find the most complete picture should use the widest possible range of media. </p> <p>Live television news provides something that no one else can - the ability, helped by better and lighter technology, to take you to the heart of the action virtually anywhere in the world. But I would still expect people to watch the main BBC and ITV bulletins, to listen to Today, to read serious newspapers, to scour online sources. </p> <p>I was struck after the fox-hunting demos that the best illustration of injured protesters was provided the following morning by an excellent spread of stills in the Daily Mail. Live news fits very usefully into that jigsaw of sources.</p> <p>So it's surely crazy to think about dismissing such a valuable tool for providing quick and visual knowledge to people about what is going on in their world. There are very, very few occasions when having too much information is other than a fleeting problem. These days the opposite is still more likely to be true - governments, armies and other bodies trying to manage the flow of information and delay it until they can put their own spin on it. (It's interesting that the first reaction of the House of Commons authorities after Wednesday's break-in of the chamber, just as after the purple flour bomb attack, was to call the broadcasters and tell them they should not be showing the pictures.) </p> <p>Russians were crying out for unfiltered and uncensored news after the Beslan siege. Their government ensured they didn't get it. </p> <p>I accept that the ability to show live news with high drama and personal suffering brings special responsibilities with it. I also accept that we don't always get things right (and as the corrections columns in newspapers attest, nor does the press). </p> <p>Two things about our coverage of Beslan made me feel uneasy. First, I thought we lingered too long on some of the funerals to the point where I felt, as a viewer, intrusive. Second, when the extraordinary pictures shot by the gunmen themselves were discovered, I thought we showed them too often in too short a time before we were able to pause for breath and explain the significance of what we were seeing. </p> <p>These are serious issues. We discuss them at work and we are ready to debate them outside, but sometimes our critics seem to lose all sense of reality. Peter Conrad accuses Sky of sending a woman reporter to Beslan so she could be 'a more emotionally ingratiating witness'. That's nonsense and, in my view, an insult to every woman journalist working hard to show that coverage of serious world events shouldn't just be left to men. I thought we'd passed that point years ago. </p> <p>Conrad also says that on the day the siege ended we overlaid one of news reports with 'a musical commentary' to stir up emotions. It didn't happen. We didn't do it. </p> <p>Like it or not, rolling news is here to stay. It's not always pretty and it often demonstrates graphically that events usually unfold in confusing and spasmodic ways. But the service we provide is a valuable one, hence its 24-hour presence in the offices of every cabinet minister, opinion former and newspaper. Even, I venture to suggest, The Observer.</p>",
  "<p> Two of the cinema's key figures were established in the early 1930s - the tough, independent cab driver by James Cagney in Taxi! (1932) and the cool professional hit man by Frank Vosper in The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) - people who literally and figuratively want to take you for a ride. They're usually men, though Betty Garrett played a taxi driver in On the Town and there are female hired killers in The Sting, Prizzi's Honour and Kill Bill. Michael Mann brings the two roles together for two intense hours in Collateral, as good a thriller as we're likely to see this year. </p> <p>Actors who normally play sympathetic roles are often keen to shed the nice-guy image and play cold-blooded assassins. Tom Cruise follows Max von Sydow, John Cusack and most recently Tom Hanks in electing to appear as the callous hit man Vincent, who turns up in Los Angeles to carry out five killings in one night for an underworld kingpin. This is the LA that Mann, a fastidious craftsman with a keen sense of space and architecture, created in his previous crime film, Heat, a place of gleaming surfaces, towering buildings surrounding wide boulevards and freeways with mean, ill-lit alleyways in between. The taxi driver is Max (Jamie Foxx), an African-American native of LA, a kindly, thoughtful man in his early thirties, who dreams of owning his own string of limousines. His character is neatly established in his exchanges with a handsome young black woman, a justice department lawyer called Anne (Jada Pinkett Smith, who like Foxx appeared in Mann's Muhammad Ali biopic). During the drive across town they subtly recognise each other's moral integrity and vulnerability, and we sense we'll be seeing more of Anne, though we don't know how. </p> <p>Max's next fare is Vincent, played as a chilly, lethal version of Cruise's customary cocky, strutting figure, like a bellboy who's inherited a big hotel. He has short grey hair, designer stubble on its way to becoming a beard, and an expensive, beautifully cut suit, which will later come apart at the left shoulder as a key indicator of his disintegration. He claims to be a real-estate man with five major calls to make before he can tie up a deal and leave town, and he offers Max $600 on top of his normal fare for a night's work. </p> <p>While Max waits in a side street for Vincent to complete his first assignment, a body comes hurtling from a fourth-floor window onto the roof of the cab. The job hasn't gone with the expected smoothness. Vincent has to reveal his identity, Max becomes his captive, and there is now a corpse in the boot. From then on the tension never lets up. </p> <p>The excellent dialogue, though not always audible, reveals Vincent to be not merely a chilly psychopath but something of a philosopher of crime along the lines of Harry Lime. He speaks of the immensity of the universe and the insignificance of man, and the regular aerial shots of the night city echo the vertiginous shots of Vienna from the ferris wheel that accompany Lime's speech on mankind in The Third Man. He also has a scathing wit. When an outraged Max asks how can he kill someone he doesn't know, Vincent says: 'Should I only kill someone when I get to know them?' Of the killer's background we only hear sardonic lies, but when asked how long he's been in the business, he does hint that he's been in government employ. </p> <p>'Private sector - six years,' he says. And we learn that he's a jazz aficionado and that he sees himself as an improviser in the style of a jazz virtuoso. One of the best sequences is a visit the pair make to a jazz club where a discussion on Miles Davis ensues in a Tarantinoesque vein. </p> <p>In another remarkable episode Max has to improvise by pretending to be Vincent when meeting the Hispanic criminal (the imposing Javier Bardem) who has hired the hit man to wipe out five key figures in the impending drug prosecution. Just before this there's a moment of comic relief when Vincent insists on accompanying the cabbie as he makes his nightly visit to his ailing mother in hospital. 'I say to my son you've got to hold a gun to his head to get him to do something,' she tells Vincent. This recalls the delectable scene in North by Northwest where Cary Grant and his mother share a lift with his would-be abductors. </p> <p>The title 'collateral' refers presumably both to the way the abduction of Max is Vincent's security, and to the deadly damage done to anyone who gets in the way of his mission. At one point an LA narcotics cop, an FBI team and a pair of Hispanic gangsters get on Vincent's trail and carnage follows in a packed disco, a superbly kinetic scene. Collateral is an expert exercise in inventive, well-paced narration (the script is by the Australian Stuart Beattie), nocturne in the manner of Taxi Driver, and a neo-noir thriller in the same league as Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Samoura\u00ef, John Boorman's Point Blank, Peter Yates's Bullitt and Mann's own Heat.</p>",

For most of us in the laity, the issue of homosexuality barely registers on our radar, yet the inclusive, liberal C of E is being pushed to the edge by fundamentalist evangelicals who have decided that homosexuality is the issue on which they must threaten schism.</p> <p>But as Stephen Bates makes clear in this brilliant overview of the current crisis engulfing the church, this is a smokescreen for the wider ambition of what he calls 'Taliban' extremists. They want to wrest control from the liberals and return the church to a dark age of blinkered, Bible-based bigotry.</p> <p>Using his impressive reporting skills (he is the Guardian's religious affairs correspondent) he interviews all the players in this tragedy, and what falls from the mouths of those who profess to a faith of compassion is often deeply depressing: 'If the liberals are starting from their own experience they are making God in their own image... we are moving into a world where the church is going to have to be countercultural, more so than it has been for a thousand years,' says David Banting, chairman of the conservative pressure group, Reform. Bates devotes an entire chapter to those scraps of Scripture that apparently condemn homosexuality and finds plenty of theologians who can challenge accepted interpretations, but, crucially, he points repeatedly to the fact that in all his teachings, Christ never refers to it.</p> <p>Bishops agree that in certain cases the divorced can be remarried in church and have long accepted the idea of contraception, yet homosexuality continues to be condemned on the basis of a biblical writ that in other examples they have not hesitated to reinterpret. They have gone as far as tolerating homosexuals among the laity, but gay clergy must abstain from any physical expression of their orientation.</p> <p>Poor Rowan Williams. Six months after his enthronement as Archbishop of Canterbury, he found himself presiding over a worldwide church that was threatening to split over the ordination of Gene Robinson, an openly gay cleric, as Bishop of New Hampshire and in tumult over the bungled appointment of Canon Jeffrey John as Bishop of Reading.</p> <p>What the evangelicals cannot grasp is that their self-righteous crusade against a tiny minority is driving away thinking heterosexuals, disgusted at their tactics and dismayed that the church's leadership is so supine.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Mantrapped</strong><br>by Fay Weldon<br>4th Estate \u00a316.99, pp268</p> <p>A man and a woman brush past each other on the staircase and exchange souls. The ensuing 'sex swap' causes chaos in their private lives - and is the ideal platform for Weldon to tease out the delicious ironies of gender difference. He finds breasts difficult, she rather likes having a 'thing'. They both eat far too much and revert to a semi-childlike state, much to the horror of his controlling girlfriend.</p> <p>Of course, Weldon being Weldon, these are hardly ordinary characters in the first place. Trisha is a washed-up celebrity - a lottery winner, who has spent her fortune and is reduced to working for the local laundry. Peter is a journalist living in a dull equal-ops relationship. Both are ripe for change in their lives.</p> <p>For years Weldon has highlighted the absurdity of male-female relationships. But actually it's not plot that surprises here, it's form. Having written a conventional autobiography, Weldon now embarks on a new 'reality' hybrid. Mantrapped is part memoir, part novel - or rather Weldon sets up a densely plotted story, and then starts intruding all over the place, offering hints, footnotes, and touching comparisons with her own life (like Trisha she has been from rags to riches and back again). Having claimed for years that all fiction springs quite free of the author, Weldon has done a complete about-turn. In a world in love with the reality genre and the Big Brother house, she argues it would be dishonourable to keep yourself out of your own novels.</p> <p>It's not exactly new. Novelists from Laurence Sterne to George Eliot are famous for offering their own lofty authorial interjections. But few would offer quite so much detail about their sex lives or the discord of marriage, or indeed the failure of the antiques trade in the 1970s (Fay's second husband Ron was a painter-turned-antiques dealer). At times it can be tiresome for the reader, as you're forced to leave the narrative of Trisha and Peter for Weldon's digressions. But gradually you stop resisting. And there are fascinating insights. This short story really was inspired by Weldon's abortion; that novel came from her 15 years of Freudian therapy.</p> <p>Weldon is remarkably good-natured about her chaotic past. She turns a clear-eye on her laziness, the failure of her first two marriages, her unlikely literary success. (When her early novels came out male critics accused them of intellectual sloppiness, a crime Weldon partly accepts, admitting that she turned her rejected TV scripts into novels, hence her reliance on the present tense, which later became so modish in the modern novel). She is also good on the myth of the 1950s Great Man (George Barker, Ted Hughes, her own husband Ron), who was actually rather terrified of female intimacy.</p> <p>Of course male intellectuals may not like the free-form style of Mantrapped either. 'It is liberating to be so cavalier with time,' she admits. Not that she ever totally relinquishes control, (she's forever teasing us about future plot twists). And some of the rants about happiness or morality or cosmetic surgery could do with a bit of editing (she freely admits her style comes close to automatic writing). But when she's on form - marshalling those elegant, deadly, sentences - there's simply no touching Weldon as a writer.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Philip and Elizabeth: Portrait of a Marriage</strong><br>by Gyles Brandreth<br>Century \u00a320, pp384</p> <p><strong>Princesses: The Six Daughters of George III</strong><br>by Flora Fraser<br>John Murray \u00a325, pp400</p> <p>So now we know - thanks to the prurient intercession of that woolly-pullied royal plaything Gyles Brandreth - what happened when the virginal Lilibet met her nautical Adonis at Dartmouth in 1939. He said: 'How do you do?' She replied: 'I'm quite well, thank you.' Oh, she also thought he looked 'achingly handsome'.</p> <p>How does Brandreth know this? He doesn't, of course, as he at once admits: the tongue-tied dialogue he writes for the two teenagers is entirely invented. Indeed his entire biography of the pair can best be read as the product of a sweatily over-heated imagination. It's the kind of imagination a snob possesses, elated by a dizzy dream of high society and of his own exclusive access to it. This is a man who, while researching his novelettish tome, danced such obsequious attendance on the Queen that a helper at a hospice she was visiting took him for an equerry and asked if his employer needed the loo. Empowered to speak on behalf of the royal bladder, he officiously replied: 'She's fine, thank you.'</p> <p>Brandreth even seems to have been sexually stimulated by proximity to the starchy monarch, and once ineptly flirted with her at a Buckingham Palace reception. On another occasion, he pressed his thigh against Princess Anne's under a dinner table. Alas, Anne's look of castrating contempt made him spend the rest of the evening with his knees girlishly clamped together.</p> <p>Brandreth's wishful thinking about his intimacy with the Windsors licenses such friskiness. Hence his scoop about nocturnal arrangements: 'Although it is really none of your business (or mine), I am able to tell you that customarily the Queen and Prince Philip do share the same bed.' Note the way he blames us for his own intrusive curiosity, and accuses us of impropriety if we're silly enough to buy his fatuous book.</p> <p>He's more circumspect about the honeymoon: 'What happened between the sheets on the night of the royal wedding I cannot tell you.' With a wince of regret, he adds: 'I was not there.' How could the newlyweds have forgotten to invite Brandreth, who would attend the opening of an envelope, let alone a royal defloration? The oversight must have been due to the fact that he wasn't born yet. He does, however, have a prize bit of carnal tattle about the next generation. He reports, on the authority of his fellow romancer Barbara Cartland, that Diana and Charles broke up because 'she wouldn't do oral sex, she just wouldn't'. The anecdote leaves me gulping with admiration for Camilla, apparently more adept at managing the princely sceptre and its pendulous orbs.</p> <p>Otherwise, what does Brandreth have to tell us? His characterisation of Elizabeth reminds me of Gertrude Stein defining a rose: 'She is what she is and what she is is the Queen.' Asked by his friends what the Queen is like, Brandreth replies: 'Much as you'd expect, in fact.' He does have it on good authority that Elizabeth once told Philip to shut up, and - in the absence of anything more substantial - he tells the story half a dozen times. You can make up your own mind whether such apercus are worth \u00a320.</p> <p>With Philip, his task is to quash gossip not to relay it. Countess Mountbatten asserts: 'I am quite sure - quite sure, absolutely certain, he has never been unfaithful to the Queen.' Brandreth interviews a succession of supposed mistresses, who all insist that their friendships with Philip were innocently high-minded. He laments the need for discussion of such distasteful matters, then adds a smirking commercial aside: 'This is the chapter that will be serialised first.'</p> <p>In return for the confidences of these hoity-toity ladies, he advertises their money-making enterprises. Potential day-trippers are supplied with the phone number of the Mountbatten estate, which can be visited for a fee. After his session with Sacha Abercorn, we are directed to the website which has turned her country house into a luxury hostelry. 'You can sleep,' Brandreth breathlessly promises, 'where the Queen slept.' He also acts as HM's estate agent, advising anyone who wants to honeymoon at Balmoral to check out the cottages for rent at the website there. Yet despite his own blend of snobbery and lubricity, he reproves a tourist who touches the nuptial bed at Broadlands and announces: 'The Queen is very keen on sex.' If you're interested, she is also partial to Oxford marmalade.</p> <p>Flora Fraser's account of George III's progeny, <strong> Princesses: The Six Daughters of George III</strong> - six daughters and nine sons, all ejected from a proficient queen who typically spent 15 minutes in labour and then handed over the offspring to a milk-cow called Mrs Muttlebury - is a less flushed affair, and it openly tells the stories of infidelity, intrigue and rancorous discontent that Brandreth suppresses.</p> <p>The Prince Regent's romps with Mrs Fitzherbert suggest that, for heirs to the throne, nothing much changes; the Regent's architectural follies anticipate Charles's spendthrift habits, which the Queen (according to Brandreth, for whom Charles is a villain) finds 'obscene'. Fraser's spurned Queen Caroline uncannily corresponds to Diana. When both fell from favour, the royal family ordered that their names be omitted from prayers for the monarchy. Caroline retaliated by attempting to gatecrash her husband's coronation, which makes me regret the fun we'll miss as a result of Diana's premature death.</p> <p>George III was mad, and his daughters led opulently useless lives. The human family is a device for passing on property and emotional dysfunctions; the royal family hoards more than the average quantity of loot, and has more than its fair share of bad, recessive genes. Isn't it time that we released the Windsors from a duty which they find so onerous, and liberated ourselves from our absurd enthralment to them?</p> <p>Brandreth, I suggest, might go into exile along with them. His performance as a self-appointed equerry-in-waiting that day at the hospice suggests that he'd be a dab hand with a loo brush and would keep their porcelain throne pristine.</p>",
  "<p>A Nobel prizewinner, a Pulitzer prizewinner and a Princeton professor to boot, Toni Morrison is a famously grand writer, one not much given to generosity when it comes to interviewers (especially, I cannot help but notice as I read over her cuttings, if they happen to be female). One poor hack, in a funk and fast running out of inquisitorial steam, made the mistake of asking her if she wrote by hand. Morrison replied: 'You've really collapsed now, haven't you?'</p> <p>I, too, fear saying the wrong thing, a dread that first took hold several weeks ago when - via a somewhat embarrassed publicist - I was asked how I was qualified to quiz America's 'national novelist'. What, for instance, was the name of the last American author I wrote about? At this point, my mind went completely blank. The only person I could think of was John Gray, author of Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus, which clearly wasn't the thing at all.</p> <p>Oh please, Lord: let me do better today. As it turns out, I needn't have worried. Perhaps it is her jet lag that has made her softer at the edges, or the fact that she is travelling with one of her two sons; but whatever the cause, I get the impression that she is definitely not about to sink her sharp intellectual teeth deep into my ankles. We meet at Channings Hotel in Edinburgh, where she will be reading from her most recent novel, Love (just published in paperback, Vintage \u00a36.99). Morrison is big and handsome, her grey braids swooped back into one oval mass so that they resemble - and, in certain circumstances, this might be appropriate - a wasp's nest.</p> <p>Right now, she is taking a mid-interview cigarette break. She smokes with blithe enthusiasm and, between sips of Earl Grey tea, cracks one wheezy joke after another about American Presidents, past and present (she can be pretty dirty when she puts her mind to it). When Morrison laughs, her entire being seems to shake - as if this raspy guffaw is the engine that powers her. Morrison is 73 now, and the most feted - and loved - writer in all America (her novels sell in their millions thanks, at least in part, to their having been featured, more than once, on her friend Oprah Winfrey's television book club).</p> <p>Busy with her ninth book, she feels she is working against the clock - 'I don't know how much time I have' - and, in many ways, she would far rather be closeted away in her boat house on the Hudson River in Rockland County than sitting here, talking, talking, talking. But Morrison has always talked. In the old days, this was because she wanted to build herself a readership, especially among African-Americans, and 'you can't do that if you're hiding behind a screen'. Now, though, there are more pressing reasons for making herself heard.</p> <p>'Do I have a feeling of America going backwards? Sure. And I can't tell you how frightening it is - to see battles we thought we had already won... We're fighting to vote again. We fighting to protest. This is a major crisis. We're at the edge of a cliff. Do we fall off? Or do we step back?'</p> <p>In her refined molasses voice, Morrison tells me that, personally, she has been in crisis mode for an awful long time. 'Ever since the election in 2000,' she says. 'Paralysed, aghast, seething.' (Morrison, I should warn, speaks as she writes, which is to say, elliptically; you are required to listen on, patiently, until her meaning becomes slowly apparent.) 'Really, it was a form of paralysis. Everyone was speechless. Then, after 11 September, there was a moment for us as a nation... for consolidation. Someone needed to act like a grown-up, and no one did. No one did. If Bush wins, the dread will move on to another level. Mishandled, wicked, duplicitous. Whatever happens with these wars, they cannot be waged properly by this administration.'</p> <p>As one who grew up with segregation, Morrison finds the new suspicion that is abroad in her country especially troubling. The position in which, for instance, Arab Americans now find themselves - they are treated with fierce mistrust - is one that is sickeningly familiar to black Americans. 'The difference is that with black people, you had the summoning of the demons, the aliens [racial myth, the assumption of black irrationality among white people, is a common theme in Morrison's fiction]. This time, no restrictions are being made. There is a bigger rationale for it. They say, \"These are the kind of people who... [commit terrorist acts].\" But the difficulty is: Arab Americans, Arab anything. They're all over the world. Everywhere!' Her voice is now clotted with sarcasm. 'So it has the double horror, for people who think in those terms, of being permanent. It's the ultimate, permanent cause of war.'</p> <p>Morrison considers that the best art is always political, and that the terrible irony of this whole situation is that it has a wonderful by-product in the form of an outpouring of words. It is not only that journalists have woken up. She believes that the climate is, however subliminally, filtering down into novels and theatre and film. She can sense it happening in her own work. 'I'm beginning to feel something unmanageable, and I have to work my way through it.'</p> <p>Toni Morrison was born Chloe Wofford in 1931, and grew up in the small steel town of Lorain, Ohio, a place she has described as 'neither plantation nor ghetto'. Even so, black people had to travel separately on trains and were often barred from public amenities. But while her mother believed that her children were entitled to equal rights, and argued that they should be allowed into the local baths, for her father, a welder, racial battle lines were more clearly drawn. 'He disliked white people,' she once said. 'He distrusted everything they said, and everything they did. It was a moral thing. He thought there was no hope for them. He wouldn't let them into the house.'</p> <p>In spite of this, Morrison insists that she felt the effects of poverty far more than racism and, for that reason, has never ceased to enjoy her earning ability. 'Nouveau riche is the best riche there is,' she says. 'I remember walking into a girlfriend's department, and screaming, \"I'm rich!\" Someone had offered me $50,000 for a book. My worries were over.' (In fact, this was a mere drop in the ocean; the Nobel prize alone was worth \u00a3563,000, and her advances now must be whopping).</p> <p>After school, she went to Howard, an all-black university in Washington, where she met her husband, a Jamaican architect called Harold Morrison. They divorced after six years, when she was pregnant with her second child, and she moved to New York with her sons where, until 1983, she worked as a senior editor at Random House. She did not begin writing - in snatched moments, when her boys were asleep - until she was in her thirties, and she was almost 40 when her first novel, The Bluest Eye, the story of a black girl who longs to look like Shirley Temple, was published. This book, and her next, Sula, sold modestly, but her third, The Song of Solomon (1977), won the Critics Circle Award, and the five after were bestsellers.</p> <p>The most well-known of these is still Beloved, the story of a runaway slave who has killed her daughter; it was this book, dedicated to the 60 million who died as a result of slavery, that won Morrison a Pulitzer (she, however, thinks that Love - an opaque novel about five women and the man who obsesses them, is her best; she has called it 'perfect').</p> <p>In the past, she has spoken fondly of her days as a single mother - the other women in the neighbourhood calling round, helping out with babysitting and pot suppers. In the Sixties and Seventies, she thinks, women struggled more, but they were happier. Does she think we have boxed ourselves into a corner?</p> <p>'More than that. There is an embarrassment of choices. But we have not really been trained to handle power. In the Eighties, I was appalled by the way women treated one another in the workplace. Women either invest men with too much power, or they strip them down so they are a weaker version of themselves.'</p> <p>She despairs of some of her female students: 'They are hopelessly concentrated not on relationships, but on sex. They have taken the notion of \"my body is my own\", but they have focused on the most superficial part: breasts... Bits. It is really sad. Fashion reinforces it. So mommies look like their daughters, little children are sexualised out of their skulls. It's unbelievable the ages people begin to explore sex among their peers. That's commodification.'</p> <p>For Morrison, 'commodification' - the default setting of those who live in a consumer society - is a disease, one that came into play even after 9/11, when patriots were urged to go out and shop, to get back into the malls, in order to keep the wheels of the economy turning. 'Why were we not told, \"Stay home, get 30 days' food in your house?\"'</p> <p>If this thought appears to contradict her vehement opposition to the fear that the current administration likes to use to manipulate the electorate, well, too bad. A natural corollary of Morrison's hauteur is her insistent passion for making statements that, to most people, seem extreme, even a bit bonkers. In her essay 'Dead Man Golfing', she likened the trial of OJ Simpson to that of slave mutineers in Melville's novels, and has always believed him to be innocent (it is 'implausible' to suggest otherwise).</p> <p>In 1998, she referred to Bill Clinton as the 'first black President', since he displayed 'almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas'.</p> <p>Her success has not, she says, made her immune from racism. 'I don't pass without insults. Let me give you an example. I walk into the Waldorf Astoria in New York to check in. We're going to have a drink, and then my friend is going to go home. She stands behind me, as I check in. Finally, the guy says, \"Oh, are you registering too?\" He thought I was the maid. My friend was trembling with anger. It was so personal. But the irony of it was that I was on the cover of a magazine that month, and there were these posters with my face on them all over New York.'</p> <p>But, in any case, she does not feel she is a success. I look at her, wide-eyed, as she says this. 'No! I haven't succeeded at anything,' she says. 'I have written good, and sometimes great books. But, for me, success is not a public thing. It's a private thing. It's when you have fewer and fewer regrets.'</p> <p>The calm boast wrapped neatly around such mournfulness is disorientating. Is she being disingenuous? Is this the thin skin of the ego-maniac at work?</p> <p>'My name is Chloe,' she says, the wonderful voice winding down now, like an ancient gramophone record. 'The Toni, a nickname, I got almost by accident. I didn't even mean to use it as the author name for my first book, but it was too late by the time I got to thinking about it. But Toni Morrison - she's over there. When I walk in the street, people talk to her and she's nice. I'm over here. There are still people in my family who call me Chloe. It's a psychological trick. I accept and agree with the enthusiasm for my work. But the other stuff, the celebrity stuff, it's of no interest to me at all.'</p> <p>This declaration, so ripe with presumption and pop psychology, merits - demands, even - some thorough unpicking. But unfortunately, my time is up. My interviewee is eager to rejoin her entourage outside. That, or she's just desperate for a smoke.</p>",
  "<p>A first Premiership win for Worcester beckons after they pressed the bottom side, Bath, to the final minute. In the end, the experience of last year's Championship finalists won through, leaving the Warriors on the end of three successive league defeats - for the first time since the end of the 1998-1999 season. </p> <p>Worcester came racing out of the blocks, with their fly-half James Brown showing dangerous ambition in their own 22 from the kick-off and it cost them dear as Brown fired a long pass in the second minute intended for Thomas Lombard, only to feed the Bath wing Brendon Daniel, who ran in from halfway. </p> <p>Worcester fought back immediately with a Tommy Hayes penalty, before Daniel cut infield to set up a ruck on the Warriors' 22 that provided Olly Barkley, returning after an ankle strain, with a straightforward drop goal. Tindall looked to have put the game beyond the home side with just 20 minutes gone as he ran onto Barkley's grubber, with Thinus Delport unable to hold him up under the posts. </p> <p>Bath looked in control, but their persistent indiscipline kept Worcester in the game despite their patent lack of a cutting edge. </p> <p> The Warriors did not threaten the Bath tryline until the closing minutes of the first half, so it fell to Hayes to keep the scoreboard ticking over.</p> <p> It was Tindall who provided the former Glasgow fly-half with his easiest opportunity on the stroke of half-time, blatantly kicking the ball away from a ruck in his own 22 as Worcester finally built up a head of steam. </p> <p> The burly centre was sent to the sin bin as Hayes put Worcester eight points behind, 20-12, with his fourth penalty out of five. </p> <p>Barkley kicked another immediately after the break, then the Warriors fought their way back to 23-19, with a fine try for Lombard after Brown took the scrum-half Neil Cole's box-kick with the unintentional help of a Bath hand. He fed the former France international. Barkley added his third penalty to keep Worcester a converted try adrift. </p> <p>Hayes then closed the gap to four points with 18 minutes remaining to set up a thrilling finale, made all the more tense when Barkley missed a simple kick from 25 metres out. </p> <p> With Lombard in the thick of it, Worcester pressed to the last as Bath faced the prospect of a third successive defeat, but in the end the Warriors were left with only their bonus point for the season as consolation after their otherwise faultless line-out failed to come good. </p> <p> <strong> WORCESTER</strong> : Delport; O'Leary, Hayes, Trueman (Hinshelwood, 24), Lombard; Brown (Roke, 57), Cole (Stuart-Smith, 74); Windo, Daly (Van Niekerk, 67), Fortey, Collier, Gillies, Greeff, Sanderson (capt), Macleod-Henderson (Hickey, 55). </p> <p><strong> BATH</strong> : Maddock; Crockett, Fleck, Tindall (Davey, 65), Daniel; Barkley, Wood; Barnes (Stevens, 31), Humphries (capt; Mears, 48), Bell, Borthwick, Grewcock, Beattie, Lipman, Feaunati. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> D Pearson<strong> </strong> (Northumberland).</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>If this Ryder Cup finally falls Europe's way - and the signs are slightly more positive that extra gold polish may be purchased - then there will be many contenders for most significant moment. Leader in the clubhouse, however, is the Paul Casey-David Howell combo and the way these two young Englishmen finished their match in the morning. </p> <p>The 18th here is a beauty. Hell no, it's a beast, a 494-yard par four that is uphill all the way to a green guarded by bunkers and framed by clagg passing itself off as grass on top of a putting surface so slick Ian Poulter could spike up his hair with it. What we are talking here is exquisite difficulty of the finest kind. </p> <p>Until Casey arrived around lunchtime on day two nobody had managed to even par this hole. Not Sergio, not Tiger, not Darren, not Phil - especially not Phil. The best score was a bogey five, usually scrambled. On the face of things, Casey was an unlikely candidate to break this mediocre mould. Of course he is hugely gifted, but he and Howell are rookies and their fourballs match against Jim Furyk and America's next big thing, Chad Campbell, was going seriously wrong before the 18th came along. </p> <p>A hole down with two to play, Howell squared matters with a 6ft birdie putt at 17. The effort was too much for him and off the next tee he carved his ball out wide and into a deep bunker. Casey, however, found the fairway with what he called 'a cracking drive', then hit an equally cracking second that wound up 50ft from the hole but on the green, from where he knocked it down to 3ft beneath the flag. </p> <p>He waited while everyone else fumbled and mumbled, waited until Campbell chunked his pitch up the green and then missed his par putt back, waited for the Americans to post their score, a five. Then he stood up and knocked his par putt in. A four. Hallelujah. And an unlikely win for Europe, one that took the morning scores to 2 to 1 in the United States' favour. Overall, however, Europe held a four-point lead and the momentum that had been building for Hal Sutton evaporated as swiftly as it had appeared. </p> <p>'We knew it would be tough, knew the Americans would be lifted by their supporters,' said Europe's skipper, Bernhard Langer. 'They played great but my guys showed their skills and determination. I think we have more depth than ever before and Casey and Howell worked magnificently. I'm proud of both of them. Their win was vital because it stopped the American momentum in its tracks. Paul and David just played some of the best golf you will ever see from two partners making their debuts in the Ryder Cup.' </p> <p>To his credit Phil Mickelson was out on the sidelines and cheering on his team-mates during all this play. It was a good effort especially when you factor in that he had barely slept. 'No, I didn't sleep hardly at all. It was a brutal night. I watched some of the pictures of me walking down the fairways yesterday and I was shocked; I looked so tight. When I've been successful this year I've been relaxed, but that's not how I've played here so far. The Europeans have been able to play loose from the start. That's what I've got to do, in fact that's what we've got to do.' </p> <p>Mickelson did not have to look far for inspiration. In the afternoon foursomes, Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood were sent out first, their opponents Chris DiMarco and Jay Haas. DiMarco is the New York Italian who says he feeds off emotion as if it was pizza, Haas is the 50-year-old picked by Sutton. They were no match for Anglo-Irish friends who feed off each other's energy, displaying a public affection for each other that is probably in breach of some local by-law as they stretched Europe's lead.</p> <p> Here is the 'looseness' sought by Mickelson. Clarke and Westwood manage to maintain focus while freewheeling in this match. It is a neat trick and it is what makes the difference between soaring talent and high achievement in golf. They tried hard not to laugh when they shook hands with their opponents after an easy 5&amp;4 victory. This difference in attitude is obvious everywhere on this roller-coaster of a course. </p> <p> Smiling or not, however, it is holing out that wins these matches. Padraig Harrington and Colin Montgomerie were heroic figures on Friday in the fourballs match against Tiger Woods and Mickelson. Six under after 11 holes they were an unstoppable force. Yesterday they struggled against Davis Love and Stewart Cink as the American fightback gained impetus and volume. </p> <p> Meanwhile Sutton, who began the matches by wearing a cowboy hat that transformed his Fred Flintstone image and encouraged comparison with Deputy Dawg instead, was in slightly more restrained mood. Having left his players alone on Friday he walked the fairways alongside them on this second day, offering advice and encouragement and making lots of body contact. </p> <p> It is all he can now do. Before this match started he told anyone willing to listen that the 'only thing that matters is winning'. After the worst start by any side in the modern Ryder Cup he was staring 'loser' in the face, panic written all over his own. Battle, however, has now been joined properly. The Americans always turn up at these matches eventually and now here they are. Sutton knows he needs to be within four, preferably three, points going into today to have a realistic chance of victory.</p> <p> Langer, on the other hand, knows he must have a significant advantage when the singles matches begin today. Some people were on the pitch after Friday thinking it was all over. It wasn't then and it isn't now. Once again it may be close. Brookline close. In 1999 Europe took a four-point advantage into the singles and lost. No one, as I recall, smiled much. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p> Herschelle Gibbs returned to form with his thirteenth one-day international century to give South Africa a substantial total to bowl at when their ICC Champions Trophy Pool B decider against West Indies resumes at The Oval today. </p> <p>Gibbs (101) shared an opening stand of 102 with his captain, Graeme Smith, and then a third-wicket alliance of 50 with Jacques Rudolph on his way to a 133-ball hundred containing nine fours and one six. </p> <p>In the six overs of West Indies batting possible before bad light and rain stopped play, openers Chris Gayle and Wavell Hinds replied to 246 for six with 20 for none - to leave everything still to play for on the reserve day. </p> <p>South Africa began cautiously on an easy-paced pitch, after being invited to bat first. But it was then only the timely wickets of Smith, Jacques Kallis, Gibbs and finally Rudolph that helped the Windies halt their opponents' momentum in what might otherwise have been a more formidable total. </p> <p>Smith was the main aggressor in the early stages but had two notable reprieves. First, on 14, the left-hander edged Ian Bradshaw's left-arm medium pace for four at a perfectly catchable height directly between wicketkeeper and a wide first slip.</p> <p> Then 10 runs later, had Ricardo Powell managed to throw down the stumps from cover, Smith would have been well short of his ground after calling for an unwise single off Corey Collymore. </p> <p>Gibbs, without a half-century in his previous 10 one-day international innings, was patient initially but soon caught up his captain as he produced a series of increasingly confident and high-class strokes. </p> <p>First change Dwayne Bravo was greeted by a thunderous Gibbs drive over mid-off from the first ball of his opening over, which also saw Smith find the cover fence. </p> <p>But just as South Africa were threatening to race out of control, the introduction of Gayle's off-spin saw off Smith, who missed with an attempted cut and lost his off bail. </p> <p>Kallis needed time to pick up the same tempo, but the pace was taken off the ball by spinners Gayle (three for 50) and Ryan Hinds. Then the Windies once again got the breakthrough they needed, the canny Bravo out-thinking Kallis with a yorker, sliding into the pads to pick out leg and middle.</p> <p> Gibbs received more fluent support from Rudolph and the opener brought up his hundred in grand manner, only to fall two balls later when out off Gayle at long-off. <br>His departure robbed South Africa of the mainstay they needed to make the most of their platform - and when Rudolph was bowled sweeping at Gayle four short of his 50, the expected big finish faltered, to produce just 75 runs in the last 10 overs. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> The ICC have promised high levels of security for today's one-day international between India and Pakistan at Edgbaston.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Union leaders are warning of strikes across Jaguar's three UK plants if the luxury car maker's US owner, Ford, does not reverse its decision to axe the historic Browns Lane factory in Coventry. </p> <p>Transport &amp; General Workers' Union leader Tony Woodley also believes it is possible that industrial action could spread to Ford's 10 other UK plants, including Dagenham and Southampton. He said he did not believe this would constitute illegal secondary action. </p> <p>In a sign that unions are prepared to work jointly to fight Ford's decision, Derek Simpson, general secretary of engineering union Amicus, said he expected his members to ask for a ballot for industrial action. </p> <p>Meetings of the joint shop stewards' committee will be held tomorrow morning, and mass meetings of union members are planned for Wednesday. The workforce is split roughly 50:50 between the two unions. </p> <p>Amicus is also planning to table an emergency motion at the Labour Party conference. The motion will state that Jaguar has broken an agreement signed with the union in 1998 that supported the company's 'long-term commitment to its activities in the West Midlands', including Browns Lane. </p> <p>It will add that the ending of vehicle manufacture there, with the loss of more than 400 jobs and the transfer of a further 425 to nearby Castle Bromwich without consultation with the unions, would not be allowed in Europe or America, and should not be allowed in the UK. </p> <p>Jaguar appeared unable to confirm this weekend how many jobs will really be lost at Browns Lane. In addition to the 400 redundancies arising out of the closure, the plant will also lose some of a tranche of 750 jobs being shed across the group, but a spokesman was unable to say precisely how many. </p> <p>Woodley said: 'I believe our members should do anything and everything to protect their jobs and the plant - including, if need be, taking strike action across Jaguar.' Asked if such action could spread across Ford and, if so, whether it would constitute secondary action, Woodley said: 'We are not there yet, but it would not be secondary action.' </p> <p>He added: 'The breaking of this agreement by this company is a disgrace and shows that British labour law does not give the same rights as laws in Europe and America.' </p> <p>Simpson said: 'I would not be surprised if we were asked to introduce a ballot. There is no one at the plant today because it is closed - and that, I think, was a deliberate ploy by the company. But the local reps are already saying there is anger about what has happened. It was not long ago that they were assuring the workforce and the government that they would continue at Browns Lane.' </p> <p>An Amicus spokesman explained that an emergency resolution at the Labour Party conference 'would seek a level playing field in employment rights'. </p> <p>A Jaguar spokesman said it was too early to discuss issues of secondary action. He added: 'Clearly a strike could have an impact on other plants.'</p>",
  "<p>While outsourcing and offshoring have entered common parlance in the past 12 months, British financial services companies seem to be developing a particular fondness for them. </p> <p>Convinced that there are huge cost savings to be made from moving call centres and processing work to countries where wages are a quarter of what employees earn in the UK, our banks and insurers are, claims research by consulting firm Deloitte, ready to move 2 million of 13 million jobs in financial services to India in the next five years. </p> <p>Offshore working raises huge political and macroeconomic issues. But the reality is that, in most cases, doing your banking via a call centre in Delhi should be no more difficult than dealing with someone in Derby. </p> <p>Is that your experience? Or has your bank placed cost savings ahead of customer service? Has it become apparent that your insurance company cares more about its shareholders than its policyholders? </p> <p>The annual Guardian and Observer Consumer Finance Awards, in association with Money Observer, offer readers the chance to have their say - an opportunity to check the health of their relationships with banks, insurers, pension providers and credit card companies. </p> <p>Now in their fifth year, the awards are becoming an important benchmark for good customer service. They are unique because they reflect the views of a wide range of consumers: the winners are voted for solely by the readers of The Guardian and The Observer and users of Guardian Unlimited Money and Moneyobserver.com websites. </p> <p>More than 7,000 readers cast their votes in May via an in-paper and online questionnaire. For each category voters were asked to name a provider and rate the service they have received on a scale of 1 to 5 (where 5 is excellent and 1 is appalling). Providers were judged against a range of criteria, including friendliness of staff, quality of literature, flexibility, efficiency of response to telephone calls, letters and emails, and competitiveness. </p> <p>The results were collated by CMRGroup.com, an independent data capture and research company, which calculated mean scores to ensure that providers were judged on quality of service, and not on quantity of results received. </p> <p>To come top in the overall winner category, a service provider had to be listed in at least three categories and to gain the highest total average score. For the second year in a row, Smile has won that accolade. </p> <p>Owned by the Co-operative bank, Smile has offered higher-than-average interest rates on savings (current accounts in particular), while charging less for loans and credit cards. If that weren't enough, Smile is also the bank with a conscience: it refuses to invest in companies that are connected to arms dealing or human rights infringements, or that have poor ecological records. </p> <p>Yet Smile would be the first to admit that none of this is as important as offering good, consistent customer service. Earlier this year, Smile commissioned researchers to find out what makes customers want to switch banks. Their findings? We are more likely to change our current account due to a bad experience such as a statement error or a rude member of bank staff than because of low interest or a poor range of products. </p> <p>The awards are an opportunity to applaud the companies who value personal service, whatever the current trends, and practise what they preach.</p> <p><strong>It depends what you're looking for</strong></p> <p><strong>Current account</strong></p> <p>Often copied but rarely bettered, First Direct - winner of this year's current account category - brought telephone banking to the masses 15 years ago, yet still enjoys huge brand loyalty among its current account customers who can access their money through good old fashioned high street branches, as well as via the telephone and internet. </p> <p><strong>Home insurance</strong></p> <p>Competition in the market for the 'silver pound' is red hot, but Retirement Insurance Advisory Service, which specialises in insuring the over - 50s has combined good customer service with low premiums to score a competitive advantage over its rivals and win this year's home insurance category.</p> <p><strong>Savings</strong></p> <p>Savvy savers have voted ING Direct top of the pops because, quite simply, it offers one of the best standard rates available by telephone and web, dominating the best buy tables for much of the last 12 months.</p> <p><strong>Car insurance</strong></p> <p>In this price - driven market, the Co - operative Insurance Society and Saga are joint winners in our car insurance poll, each scoring high marks for consistent focus on competitive rates, attentive staff and efficient claims procedures.</p> <p><strong>Travel insurance</strong></p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer has enjoyed better years on the high street, but when it comes to travel cover, the retailer has found the formula for success, winning this year's travel insurance category with its competitively priced range of single trip and annual policies and responsive claims handling services.</p> <p><strong>Health insurance</strong></p> <p>A non - profitmaking cash benefit provider, Westfield Health, the winner of this year's health insurance category, is gaining a healthy market share through customer service that promises 85 per cent of claims paid within two working days and 100 per cent within five.</p> <p><strong>Share dealing</strong></p> <p>Readers have voted Comdirect their favourite sharedealer in this year's awards.

  "The blood has been washed away but the blackened concrete below a broken lamppost in this sluggish town's main plaza is an inescapable reminder of the grisly lynching that took place here this summer. <p>The mayor of Ayo Ayo, Benjam\u00edn Altamirano, was hanged from the lamppost and set ablaze. The post mortem suggested he had been severely beaten. </p> <p>Apart from his family, no one mourns for Altamirano in Ayo Ayo, a poor rural municipality an hour's drive from La Paz on the windswept Altiplano plain, homeland of the Aymara people. In fact, most people in the town approve of the killing. No one has claimed responsibility, but the authorities have arrested at least 10 suspects. </p> <p>'Altamirano was corrupt, just like the rest of the politicians,' said 59-year-old tailor Emilio Mamani as he walked through the plaza. 'We told him if he did not keep his promises we would take more drastic measures. We told him very clearly. But he would not listen.' </p> <p>The lynching came less than two months after Aymara people in a village in neighbouring Peru lynched a mayor also accused of corruption. And it won't be the last, warn Aymara leaders. Fed up with corrupt, unresponsive government institutions long controlled by a white and mestizo elite in La Paz, the people of the Altiplano are taking justice into their own hands. </p> <p>Residents of Ayo Ayo defend the killing of Altamirano as the rightful exercise of communal justice, a homegrown legal system practised semi-clandestinely in the region since the time of the Incas. Critics say the killing is little more than savagery. </p> <p>What is certain is that, less than a year after thousands of Aymara peasants and urban slum dwellers staged massive road-blocking protests that drove Bolivia's President from power, the harsh Altiplano remains a redoubt of fierce anti-government defiance and, some analysts say, the most tangible threat to the precarious administration of interim President Carlos Mesa. </p> <p>At various times in recent years, Aymara peasants have expelled police, judges and prosecutors from Ayo Ayo and other towns. Some are demanding self-rule. </p> <p>'We Aymara carry rebellion in our blood,' said Ram\u00f3n Coba, who heads the leading Ayo Ayo peasant organisation. 'Bolivia is totally corrupt, not just the mayor. All of them should be finished in the same way, if not burnt then drowned or strangled or pulled apart by four tractors... It's the only way they are going to learn.' </p> <p>Ayo Ayo is steeped in revolt. The municipality is the birthplace of Tupaj Katari, a legendary warrior who led an uprising of thou sands of Aymara peasants against Spanish colonialists in 1781 before he was captured and executed. The lamppost where Altamirano was hanged stands in the shadow of a towering bronze statue of Katari. </p> <p>People in Ayo Ayo began demanding Altamirano's resignation after he was accused of embezzlement in 2002. A group of locals held him captive until he promised to resign, and they burnt down his house. But Altamirano, who is also Aymara, then refused to step down. As a two-year legal battle dragged on with no resolution in sight, Ayo Ayo residents opposed to Altamirano lost their patience. 'We would have been satisfied if Benjam\u00edn had admitted he had made mistakes, or if he had proposed a punishment for himself, or if the authorities had fined him,' said Coba. 'But none of this happened. What else could we do?' </p> <p>Communal justice is widely practised in rural Aymara communities, where it usually resolves mundane issues such as compensating peasants whose crops have been destroyed by a neighbour's cattle or sheep. Physical punishment is rare, and generally limited to a public lashing. The death penalty is used in extreme cases when the entire community decides there is no alternative. </p> <p>Ayo Ayo typifies a growing disillusionment among Bolivians with their representative democracy, which has brought rising rates of poverty, unemployment and crime. </p> <p>There have been 27 lynchings in Bolivia since 2001, compared to six in the previous five years, according to Juan Ram\u00f3n Quintana, director of Cordillera University's Democracy and Security Observatory.</p>",
  "<b>London double murder suspect still being questioned by police</b> <p>Police yesterday continued to question a man arrested on Friday in connection with the murder of a north London couple. Dr Derek Robinson, a retired consultant paediatrician, and Jean Robinson, a music teacher, right, are thought to have struggled with their killer before they died in what police describe as a bloodbath. The couple, who had been stabbed to death, were found by a decorator who had come to work on their house. The killer, thought to be in his 20s, was seen jumping the fence at the back of the house as he got away. It is understood the man went for treatment at London's University College Hospital where staff saw his wounds and alerted police. Dr Robinson was also a volunteer with the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. He was a leading authority on the ageing process of teenagers, giving evidence in a number of cases involving young refugees whom the Home Office had sought to prove were adults.</p> <p><b> Teenager fights curfew law</b></p> <p> A 14-year-old boy is to challenge government policy in the High Court over night-time curfews on youngsters aged under 16. Lawyers acting for the boy will argue that powers in the Anti-Social Behaviour Act are too restrictive and breach his human rights. The law allows police and councils to impose night-time curfews and an unsupervised child in a designated area after 9pm can be escorted home by police - even if they have done nothing wrong. The teenager, from Richmond-upon-Thames, London, has been granted legal aid. </p> <p><b> Father plunges off 150ft cliff</b></p> <p> A father flying a kite on a seaside clifftop with his five-year-old son died after he toppled over the edge. Barry Riple, 38, of Newhaven, was flying his kite at Seaford Head, in East Sussex, on Thursday when he fell 150 feet to his death. Police are investigating whether he tripped or was dragged over the edge by a strong gust of wind. </p> <p><b>Family group targets election </b></p> <p>Protest group Fathers 4 Justice has said that it has 200 members interested in contesting 200 marginal seats at the next general election. A spokesman for the group, John Ison, said he would be fighting the Redditch seat in Worcestershire currently held by the Deputy Minister for Women and Equality, Jacqui Smith. </p> <p><b> Charity chief's sex shame</b></p> <p>The UK-born director of Central America's main children rights group has been sacked, saying he had 'acted incorrectly' with a boy the organisation had once helped. The group, Casa Alianza, said Bruce Harris had admitted paying for sex with a 19-year-old Honduran who had been a resident in one of its shelters. Harris was awarded an OBE in 2000 for his work with street children in Latin America. </p> <p><b> Sally Army faces \u00a39.6m crisis</b></p> <p>The Salvation Army may have to cut administration staff because of a \u00a39.6 million shortfall in donations, the charity said yesterday. The 126-year-old charity has 4,500 salaried staff and an estimated 50,000 volunteers. </p> <p><b>London opens its doors</b></p> <p>The 12th annual London Open House takes place this weekend, during which buildings that are normally closed to the public are opened up. Visitors can also inspect sites under construction such as Wembley Stadium. Last year's event attracted 350,000 visitors. </p> <p><b>Speed cop</b></p> <p>Former detective superintendent Ray Mallon - now the elected mayor of Middlesbrough - who is best known for pioneering 'zero tolerance' policing has been clocked doing 75mph in a 50mph zone on the M6. He said he would pay the \u00a360 fine. </p> <p><b>On the menu</b></p> <p>Anton Mosimann is selling his collection of royal dinner menus dating back a century. The sale at Bonhams in London on 7 October also features the top chef's collection of wartime pamphlets on how to make the most of what food was available during the rationing period. </p> <p><b>Ukip campaign</b></p> <p>Robert Kilroy-Silk, the former television presenter now Euro MP for the East Midlands, visited Hartlepool yesterday with the Ukip by-election candidate Stephen Allison. His visit follows those of Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy as well as a host of Labour ministers.</p>",
  "<p>Roland Mouret makes really nice frocks. In a fashion scene dominated by severe and challenging and flashy-hooker-inspired contraptions - Versace and Cavalli and Dolce &amp; Gabbana and their brands of jewel-encrusted, luridly sexual, red carpet-appropriate starlet wear - Mouret's dresses are almost shocking in their cool, serene, straightforward loveliness. They drape and cling and flirt with flesh, there's a simplicity to them, a gentle glamour. Roland Mouret is the renaissance of hackneyed old-fash cliches such as 'chic', and 'wearable', and 'achingly covetable'. 'I am not tits and arse,' he says. </p> <p>He's not. And right now, partly because of this, Roland Mouret is enjoying A Moment. Testimony to Mouret's moment includes a fast-building and slavishly dedicated celebrity following: Gwyneth Paltrow, Naomi Watts, ubiquitous arbiter of cool Scarlett Johansson, Thandie Newton, teen screen queen Mischa Barton from The OC, Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas, and Yasmin Le Bon, for starters. Oh, and the public support of David Furnish, leading light of the A-gay scene.</p> <p>Then there's the delicate but convincing snaring of the US market. Two seasons ago, the Frenchman transferred his collection from its spiritual and geographical home - the runways of London - to New York. To an outsider, the American fashion market is as resistant and elusive as the American pop music market. Brit sensibilities (which Mouret has embraced wholesale) are traditionally too quirky, too hip, not commercial enough for the US. Yet Mouret managed to crack it first time around. </p> <p>He also has endorsement at the highest echelons of fashion's power pack. He's been repeatedly approached to design for the industry's big-gun, big-money labels, none of whom he'll name, because he's turned them down. And people like Vogue's mighty Harriet Quick are declaring themselves long-term champions of his work, saying: 'Roland's clothes are exquisite, sophisticated, but with a young heart. They're sexy, not vulgar; glam and sensual but with bite. There's nothing sugary about them.' The future of celebrity dressing, of glamour and elegance, it seems, belongs to Mouret.</p> <p>Roland Mouret is partway through celebrating his 43rd birthday when we meet in his big, mannequin-strewn, Gauloises-smogged Chelsea atelier. It's a creative hub staffed uniquely by languid, hip, beautiful types, all of whom are at least a foot taller than me, and several inches skinnier.</p> <p>How are you? I ask him. 'Good, very good! My birthday, today!' It was mine last week, I say. 'A Leo, you are. I am Virgo,' he replies. After 11 years in London, Mouret's English is appealingly eccentric - fluid and fast and prettily accented. He folds his tall, perfectly proportioned frame on to a chair, lights a fag, and smiles a suck-you-in, win-you-over smile of genuine sweetness.</p> <p>I didn't want to like Mouret. We've been through an intensely annoying interlude trying to arrange today's shoot, stymied at every turn by Mouret's determination that we should find a girl with size-six hips to model his current collection. Even in fashion-world terms, this is borderline body fascist - a girl who is the standard 5ft 8in or more tall, but measures nothing more than 30 inches at her widest point. For three days or so, we've suggested models, and Mouret's office has routinely rejected them. I'd concluded that I was dealing with a precious, controlling and fundamentally woman-loathing type. But I hadn't counted on his charm. Flattering in an intensely clever, subtle way and on such an instinctive level, that you don't realise you're being charmed until it's too late. It probably doesn't help that he's impressively handsome. A long, lithe, alluring streak of Frenchness, mixed with a bit of Clark Gable, a pinch of Bryan Ferry. He could be 33. Pathetically disarmed, I congratulate Mouret on his age-defying gorgeousness. He responds with a considered, if dubious, line in Cantona-esque philosophising. 'You know,' he says, 'I think to look younger, it's as bad as to look older than you are. When people say: \"But you look so young!\" I say, \"But I am 43! I have been through it, through all those 43 years.\" I have lived it all.' </p> <p>Roland Mouret was born into a family of butchers in Lourdes, in 1961. 'My dad wanted me to be a butcher, but I never wanted that. I wanted to be in fashion. I love to draw, and when I was in this little village and I have this fantasy world in my head, I was attracted by dressing people. And you know, when you are a butcher, you have to wear an apron and stuff.'</p> <p>So fashion was as removed from the unadorned, unfussy grittiness and uniform of the family trade as anything could be?</p> <p>'No. I mean, yes, it was the opposite, but the butchers ... it was related to clothings. My work is often inspired by folding, and a butcher's apron, this is folded, and you have the knives which probably are related to scissors. I learnt with my dad to not be frightened and to go for it. To cut.'I suggest, gently, that his blossoming gayness must have made him feel even more separate from the small-town Lourdes scene, but Mouret either doesn't hear me, or he strategically ignores me.</p> <p>At 18, Mouret left Lourdes for Paris, where he enrolled at fashion school, only to abandon the course after three brief months. 'School is not for me, really. I never learnt from school. I love to learn from life.' (He raises his eyebrows at this last bit, so that I know he's deliberately flirting with naff.) Mouret launched himself on to the Parisian club scene, absorbing and assimilating Europe's hippest sub-culture. He fell in with the beautiful people, started modelling, got swept along on a tide of decadence and debauchery. Crucially, he started making clothes for himself. 'I was 20,' he says, 'it was my youth, so I reinvent myself. I make my own clothes to go to club. It was not about paying at the entrance, it was like, are you the right person to enter? So you had to ... create yourself, and you had to understand how clothes and your identity could be mixed together. It was this amazing place, The Palace, and the mix of people - from Lesley Winner, who was just 18 and becoming this amazing top model, an androgyne David Bowie top model, to Nureyev, to Grace Jones.'</p> <p>It sounds as heady and dangerous as Studio 54.</p> <p>'It was! Yes, it was exactly that, the same movement in New York, Paris and Berlin. And you had really to look and be yourself. To be 20 in the Eighties in Paris, that was an amazing experience.' Jean Paul Gaultier spotted Mouret in a club, and asked him to style his first menswear show, because, 'at the time I was wearing trousers with braces and with the fly open and big pants underneath, and Jean Paul, the theme of his show at the time was trousers with double fly-ers and keep them open like this, and so I did his first men's show.' He didn't particularly enjoy modelling ('I don't like the spotlight. I love all the time to be in the dark and push someone else out in the spotlight,') although he was predictably successful at it, so he began styling instead, for British i-D and French Glamour. He was an inventive stylist. 'He used to turn up to shoots with no clothes,' remembers our photographer Kevin Davies. 'I'd say, where are the clothes? He'd say, hold on, I'm going to make them. And then he would.' Mouret also had stints as an art director for designer Robert Clergerie's promotional campaigns and directed a pop video or two. 'But after a while, I need the interaction of another culture.' So he packed up, came to London, which had fascinated him since he was a child because it was so un-French, and opened a concept coffee shop on Wardour Street.</p> <p>Freedom was a cafe and exhibition space with a lounge music soundtrack and a mixed gay/straight clientele, which - Mouret insists - shaped London's daytime scene, kick-started the regeneration of Soho, and ultimately acted as a catalyst for the entire Cool Britannia movement. 'In my twenties,' he says, 'I participate, I was part of a crowd, part of other people creation. In my thirties, I had to create this crowd myself. So I did it. Did we know we were starting this big thing? Yes! Yes we knew it.' (Mouret clearly doesn't go in for anything as gauche as humility. You wouldn't catch him admitting to inadvertently stumbling on a good idea.) His success trajectory seems effortless in the retelling, I say. Everything he tried, every new incarnation he experimented with worked for him. Surely it wasn't really that easy?</p> <p>'Yes!' Mouret says. 'Easy! It was so easy. I think that's what I learnt when I was with my dad. When you learn a routine of work, how to be responsible in a job, you put the creativity in, and it works. And when you are creative, nothing is a problem.'</p> <p>He wasn't a renaissance man, he says. 'I was more like a chameleon. I could be everywhere, I could create for any kind of thing. It's like when you're in a village and you have all these hormones, I had all these creative hormones. I could just, like, splash everywhere.'</p> <p>His first foray into commercial fashion design sprouted from the Freedom crowd. Franco Penne of fashion concern Gibo approached him with financial backing, 'And he said, \"Something's happening with your bar, do you want to design a collection about that?\" And we create People Corporation. I was creative director.'</p> <p>People Corporation was a grungy, messy, dressed-down range, some million light years from Mouret's current aesthetic. But that, he explains, was as it should be. 'My starting point was the crowd of the bar, and the movement in New York for Jerry Springer. White trash culture. I saw it, and I think there is something there. Rebellious, and the 15 minutes of fame that Andy Warhol talk about, and is a generation that's going to be related about rock, trash, porn. You could see all the elements coming. And I think to capture that.' It proved incredibly popular with the hip Japanese market, who made it an instant success, but who equally destroyed it, when recession demolished their economy, and Gibo withdrew funding. </p> <p>At this point, Mouret decided to launch his own label. 'I was 36, and I say, if I don't do it now, at 40 I'm going to be a bitter bastard.' He bought a hand-powered sewing machine, a dummy and some fabric, and in a little over three-and-a-half months, with funds of a little less than \u00a32,000, he created his first collection. It was inspired by 'when women and men make love, the inhibition of frustration. And after, you take a towel or sheet and you wrap yourself, and beauty of draping yourself in fabric,' and it showed at London fashion week in 1997, to great acclaim. It was at this point, Mouret says, that he realised he'd found his metier, and the desire to constantly diversify, to keep experimenting with alternative creative pursuits, left him. 'I was so sure about myself, it please me so much, I didn't want to let it go. It was the first time I didn't feel like I was missing something. I see every outfit and I think, I understand myself more and more.'</p> <p>Roland Mouret the label was born, and began its swift, sure ascent in the eyes of the fashion elite and the celebrity classes. And Roland Mouret, the man, gently embraced success.</p> <p>What's his life like now, I wonder. 'Good! Very good,' he says. He doesn't go in for decadent, excessive lifestyle trappings; he doesn't have a trophy boyfriend, or any boyfriend at all. 'I would like this. But it is not time.' He has his friends. He likes parties, but he can't handle drink. 'Three glasses of wine, and I am drunk. I dance on the table!' He's ambitious: 'Of course. Everyone's ambitious for what they love, no? So I have the cruise line now, and we start another line of accessories, many projects.' But he despairs of the fashion industry sometimes, because he despairs of society's lack of depth, and fashion slavishly reflects that. He also despairs of badly dressed women on the street. 'They are not enjoying to be woman. Like it is a difficulty. Like if they start to be too sensual, they think people will have a bad impression about them. Woman try to disappear a lot of the time. It make me sad.' Which, for all his body-fascist tendencies, is something approaching commendable. Does he love women, then? 'Yes. My sexuality is my sexuality. It's my private life. But this job, it allows me to be straight for 10 hours a day.' </p> <p>He's rumoured to take himself dreadfully seriously, and to be horrendously controlling - but also, to be kind and very human. But above everything else, Roland Mouret is concerned with dressing women in pieces of abject gorgeousness. With creating really, really nice frocks. There are worse ways to live your life.</p>",
  "<p>It was very interesting to hear that owning a cat increases a man's pulling power, because it definitely doesn't increase a woman's. Whereas the male cat owner is apparently imbued with caring, sharing qualities, owning a cat for a single woman these days is tantamount to admitting you're a frigid, emotionally unstable sociopath who should probably be burnt at the stake as a witch. I don't have a cat at present, more's the pity, but that doesn't mean I haven't smelled the fear in supermarkets: all those single women chugging up to the checkout, trying desperately to hide their half-filled trolleys. The ready meals are bad enough, but it's the little packets of posh foil-wrapped cat food that supposedly flash like neon signs: 'I need a man and a baby.' That's what loving a cat says about a woman these days: she's so lonely, pathetic and socially stunted she has to pour all she's got, every hope and emotion, every good thing about her, into some self-centred opportunistic little fur-bag. But as all true feline lovers know, having a cat says so much more (and less) than that. </p> <p>By definition, non-cat lovers don't understand about cats, and that is why they are tragic excuses for human beings. I will say this one more time and then I will forever hold my peace: how can you not love cats? What is wrong with you? It wouldn't matter so much if those people who 'don't get' cats could just resist the urge to bore the world with their lack of insight. 'I prefer dogs,' drones the party line. 'They give something back. Cats are just selfish.' What these people don't realise is that this is precisely why people like cats. They're proud, independent, intriguing creatures. It's not that they can't run after your dumb sticks in the park, or beg, or play dead, or whatever else dogs do to suck up to their owners, they just won't, they don't see why they should - and how smart is that? If you ask me, dogs have blown it with all their grovelling and showing off, all those tricks: now they have to do it or they'll lose their jobs. Cats, on the other hand, are chilled: they believe in themselves as beautiful creatures it's just nice to have around. Say what you like about cats, but they're the supermodels of the animal kingdom. They know they've got it all going on. </p> <p>I don't want this to turn into an anti-dog rant. I love all God's creatures, which is why I refrain from eating them. The only annoying thing about dogs is the way men (and it's nearly always men) seem to use them as some kind of personality test. For some reason, men are really into all that 'Are you a dog or a cat person?' rubbish. They really listen to your answer, they really want to know - and these are the same men who back away making the sign of the cross when you ask them about their star sign. Apart from that, I have nothing against dogs at all. The real issue here is the complete lack of parity in pet-owning sexual politics. A single man owns any animal (dog, cat, goldfish) and suddenly he's the caring, sharing answer to a woman's prayers; a single woman owns a cat and she's branded a lonely bunny-boiler. The 'single woman and cat' prejudice has become so out of control, I wouldn't be surprised if there were women out there who hold on to bad relationships because it's their mask, their 'beard' for having a cat. 'Oh no, I need to end this relationship, but then I'd be branded a sad single woman with a cat.' Stranger things have happened.</p> <p>It seems to me that single female cat lovers have carried the burden and the stigma of Bridget Jones mythology long enough. It's time to fight back, stand tall and proud with that supermarket trolley. If you're really daring, take your cat along to the supermarket with you; get yourself a T-shirt printed: 'Cats 1 Men 0'. Not only is cat prejudice sexist and offensive, it is also total codswallop. For, ironically enough, owning a cat does say something about you and, contrary to popular belief, it's all good - much better than what owning dogs says about their owners. When you think about it logically, in that 'dogs or cats' way men love, then it makes perfect sense that cat lovers are the best kind of people, both with cats and with other people. After all, who do you want in your life? A control-freak 'dog person' who insists you run around jumping through hoops exhausting yourself being 'fun' to prove you love them and then puts you on a lead, or a laid-back 'cat person' who adores you for 'just being', end of story, no questions asked? I'd answer that myself, but I'm too busy purring.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>I remember the first time I had sex - I still have the receipt. The girl was alive, as far as I could tell, she was warm and she was better than nothing. She cost me \u00a320.</p> <p>I was 16 then and I'm 41 now. I have spent 25 years throwing my money and heart at tarts. I have slept with every nationality in every position in every country. From high-class call girls at \u00a31,000 a pop to the meat-rack girls of Soho at \u00a315, I have probably slept with more than 1,000 prostitutes, at a cost of \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>I am a connoisseur of prostitution: I can take its bouquet, taste it, roll it around my mouth, give you the vintage. I have used brothels, saunas, private homes from the internet and ordered girls to my flat prompt as pizza. While we are on the subject, I have also run a brothel. And I have been a male escort. I wish I was more ashamed. But I'm not. I love prostitutes and everything about them. And I care about them so much I don't want them to be made legal.</p> <p>In English brothels you shuffle into a seedy room so dim you can only meet the girl by Braille. But in New York last year I sat on a four-poster bed while 10 girls paraded in front of me one by one, like bowls of sushi on a carousel. 'Hi,' they would say, 'I'm Tiffany', 'I'm Harmony', 'I'm Michelle', and I would rise and kiss them. It was so touching, so sweet, so kind. There should always, no matter what, be politeness. It is the way the outside world should work, selfishly but honestly.</p> <p>The great thing about sex with whores is the excitement and variety. If you say you're enjoying sex with the same person after a couple of years you're either a liar or on something. Of all the sexual perversions, monogamy is the most unnatural. Most of our affairs run the usual course. Fever. Boredom. Trapped. This explains much of the friction in our lives - love being the delusion that one woman differs from another. But with brothels there is always the exhilaration of not knowing what you're going to get. </p> <p>The problem with normal sex is that it leads to kissing and pretty soon you've got to talk to them. Once you know someone well the last thing you want to do is screw them. I like to give, never to receive; to have the power of the host, not the obligation of the guest. I can stop writing this and within two minutes I can be chained, in the arms of a whore. I know I am going to score and I know they don't really want me. And within 10 minutes I am back writing. What I hate are meaningless and heartless one-night stands where you tell all sorts of lies to get into bed with a woman you don't care for. </p> <p>The worst things in life are free. Value seems to need a price tag. How can we respect a woman who doesn't value herself? When I was young I used to think it wasn't who you wanted to have sex with that was important, but who you were comfortable with socially and spiritually. Now I know that's rubbish. It's who you want to have sex with that's important. In the past I have deceived the women I have been with. You lie to two people in your life; your partner and the police. Everyone else gets the truth.</p> <p>Part of me used to enjoy the deception. There was something about the poverty of desire with one's girlfriend. Sex without betrayal I found meaningless. Without cruelty there was no banquet. Having a secret life is exhilarating. I also have problems with unpaid-for sex. I am repulsed by the animality of the body, by its dirt and decay. The horror for me is the fact that the sublime, the beautiful and the divine are inextricable from basic animal functions. For some reason money mitigates this. Because it is anonymous. </p> <p>What I hate with women generally is the intimacy, the invasion of my innermost space, the slow strangulation of my art. The writer chained for life to the routine of a wage slave and the ritual of copulation. When I love somebody, I feel sort of trapped. Three years ago I was saved. I found a girl whom I could fall in love with ... and sleep with prostitutes with. She sends me to brothels to sleep with women for her. I buy her girls for her birthday and we go to whorehouses together. I am free forever from the damp, dark prison of eternal love.</p> <p>A prostitute exists outside the establishment. She is either rejected by it or in opposition to it, or both. It takes courage to cross this line. She deserves our respect, not our punishment. And certainly not our pity or prayers.</p> <p>Of course, the general feeling in this country is that the man is somehow exploiting the woman, but I don't believe this. In fact, the prostitute and the client, like the addict and the dealer, is the most successfully exploitative relationship of all. And the most pure. It is free of ulterior motives. There is no squalid power game. The man is not taking and the woman is not giving. The whore fuck is the purest fuck of all. </p> <p>Why does a sleazy bastard like me like whores so much? Why pay for it? The problem is that the modern woman is a prostitute who doesn't deliver the goods. Teasers are never pleasers; they greedily accept presents to seal a contract and then break it. At least the whore pays the flesh that's haggled for. The big difference between sex for money and sex for free is that sex for money usually costs a lot less.</p> <p>But it is more than this. What I want is the sensation of sex without the boredom of its conveyance. Brothels make possible contacts of astounding physical intimacy without the intervention of personality. I love the artificial paradise; the anonymity; using money, the most impersonal instrument of intimacy to buy the most personal act of intimacy. Lust over love, sensation over security, and to fall into a woman's arms without falling into her hands.</p> <p>Having an instinctive sympathy for those condemned by conventional society, I wanted to cross the line myself. To pay for sex is to strip away the veneer of artifice and civilisation and connect with the true animal nature of man. Some men proudly proclaim that they have never paid for it. Are they saying that money is more sacred than sex? </p> <p>But one of the main reasons I enjoy prostitutes is because I enjoy breaking the law - another reason I don't want brothels made legal. There is a charm about the forbidden that makes it desirable. When I have dinner every evening in Soho I always think: isn't scampi delicious - what a pity it isn't illegal. I'm sure I am not alone in this. Even Adam himself did not want the apple for the apple's sake; he wanted it only because it was forbidden.</p> <p>As for the girls, the argument is that making it legal will somehow make it safer, but Soho has one of the lowest crime rates in the country. Anyway, crime and risk are part of the texture of life. Indeed, Freud tells us: 'Life loses interest when the highest stake in the game of living, life itself, may not be risked.' Risk is what separates the good part of life from the tedium.</p> <p>I decided to ask my Claudia, my favourite prostitute. I first spotted her in the street in Knightsbridge 10 years ago and was so taken by her haunted beauty that I decided to follow her. There was an air of great quality about Claudia. The faces of English girls look as if there is not enough materials to go round. They have thin lips and papery eyelids, box jawbones, prominent Adam's apples and withered hearts. Claudia looks Mediterranean - her lips are full and curly, her nostrils flared, her eyes black and as big as saucers.</p> <p>She walked and I stalked all the way to Soho and down Brewer Street. No. No way. She couldn't be! She turned, and walked into a brothel. I couldn't believe it. I could fuck Raquel Welch for \u00a325. </p> <p>When I ask if she wants prostitution legalised, she reacts violently: 'No way! I tried to take a regular job a few months ago. After tax and national insurance I was left with practically nothing. So I came back here. On a good day here I can take \u00a3500. I don't have a pimp, so after paying the overheads and the maid I've got more than enough.' There you are. Income tax has made more liars out of the British people than prostitution.</p> <p>I know a little bit about the business side. Some years ago I became a madam and a male escort. I turned one of the rooms in my flat in Shepherd Market into a knocking shop and joined an escort agency. I went into prostitution looking for love, not money. That said, I always took cash. The women wanted company, someone willing to please at the midnight hour, and straight sex. It was nerve-wracking wondering if I was going to be able to get it up or get on, but at least I had a valid reason for liking my lovers - they paid me. I didn't care if someone called me a whore and a pimp.</p> <p>So you see, I have always been a prostitute by sympathy. As for the rest of society, prostitution is the mirror of man, and man has never been in danger of becoming bogged down in beauty. So why don't we leave it alone? Or learn to love it, like me? Sex is one of the most wholesome, spiritual and natural things money can buy. And like all games, it becomes more interesting when played for money. And even more so when it is illegal. </p> <p>Hookers and drunks instinctively understand that common sense is the enemy of romance. Will the bureaucrats and politicians please leave us some unreality. I know what you are thinking. That it's all very well for people like me to idealise whores and thieves; to think that the street is somehow noble and picturesque; I have never had to live there. But so what? One day I will. Until such time, I have to pay for it. How else would someone young, rich and handsome get sex in this city? Yes, yes, I know. Prostitution is obscene, debasing and disgraceful. The point is, so am I.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Collateral </strong><br>(120 mins, 15) <br> Directed by Michael Mann; starring Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo</p> <p>Two of the cinema's key figures were established in the early 1930s - the tough, independent cab driver by James Cagney in Taxi! (1932) and the cool professional hit man by Frank Vosper in The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) - people who literally and figuratively want to take you for a ride. They're usually men, though Betty Garrett played a taxi driver in On the Town and there are female hired killers in The Sting, Prizzi's Honour and Kill Bill. Michael Mann brings the two roles together for two intense hours in Collateral, as good a thriller as we're likely to see this year. </p> <p>Actors who normally play sympathetic roles are often keen to shed the nice-guy image and play cold-blooded assassins. Tom Cruise follows Max von Sydow, John Cusack and most recently Tom Hanks in electing to appear as the callous hit man Vincent, who turns up in Los Angeles to carry out five killings in one night for an underworld kingpin. This is the LA that Mann, a fastidious craftsman with a keen sense of space and architecture, created in his previous crime film, Heat, a place of gleaming surfaces, towering buildings surrounding wide boulevards and freeways with mean, ill-lit alleyways in between. The taxi driver is Max (Jamie Foxx), an African-American native of LA, a kindly, thoughtful man in his early thirties, who dreams of owning his own string of limousines. His character is neatly established in his exchanges with a handsome young black woman, a justice department lawyer called Anne (Jada Pinkett Smith, who like Foxx appeared in Mann's Muhammad Ali biopic). During the drive across town they subtly recognise each other's moral integrity and vulnerability, and we sense we'll be seeing more of Anne, though we don't know how. </p> <p>Max's next fare is Vincent, played as a chilly, lethal version of Cruise's customary cocky, strutting figure, like a bellboy who's inherited a big hotel. He has short grey hair, designer stubble on its way to becoming a beard, and an expensive, beautifully cut suit, which will later come apart at the left shoulder as a key indicator of his disintegration. He claims to be a real-estate man with five major calls to make before he can tie up a deal and leave town, and he offers Max $600 on top of his normal fare for a night's work. </p> <p>While Max waits in a side street for Vincent to complete his first assignment, a body comes hurtling from a fourth-floor window onto the roof of the cab. The job hasn't gone with the expected smoothness. Vincent has to reveal his identity, Max becomes his captive, and there is now a corpse in the boot. From then on the tension never lets up. </p> <p>The excellent dialogue, though not always audible, reveals Vincent to be not merely a chilly psychopath but something of a philosopher of crime along the lines of Harry Lime. He speaks of the immensity of the universe and the insignificance of man, and the regular aerial shots of the night city echo the vertiginous shots of Vienna from the ferris wheel that accompany Lime's speech on mankind in The Third Man. He also has a scathing wit. When an outraged Max asks how can he kill someone he doesn't know, Vincent says: 'Should I only kill someone when I get to know them?' Of the killer's background we only hear sardonic lies, but when asked how long he's been in the business, he does hint that he's been in government employ. </p> <p>'Private sector - six years,' he says. And we learn that he's a jazz aficionado and that he sees himself as an improviser in the style of a jazz virtuoso. One of the best sequences is a visit the pair make to a jazz club where a discussion on Miles Davis ensues in a Tarantinoesque vein. </p> <p>In another remarkable episode Max has to improvise by pretending to be Vincent when meeting the Hispanic criminal (the imposing Javier Bardem) who has hired the hit man to wipe out five key figures in the impending drug prosecution. Just before this there's a moment of comic relief when Vincent insists on accompanying the cabbie as he makes his nightly visit to his ailing mother in hospital. 'I say to my son you've got to hold a gun to his head to get him to do something,' she tells Vincent. This recalls the delectable scene in North by Northwest where Cary Grant and his mother share a lift with his would-be abductors. </p> <p>The title 'collateral' refers presumably both to the way the abduction of Max is Vincent's security, and to the deadly damage done to anyone who gets in the way of his mission. At one point an LA narcotics cop, an FBI team and a pair of Hispanic gangsters get on Vincent's trail and carnage follows in a packed disco, a superbly kinetic scene. Collateral is an expert exercise in inventive, well-paced narration (the script is by the Australian Stuart Beattie), nocturne in the manner of Taxi Driver, and a neo-noir thriller in the same league as Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Samoura\u00ef, John Boorman's Point Blank, Peter Yates's Bullitt and Mann's own Heat.</p>",
  "<p>How excited everybody seems to be about David Beckham crying in the street. Opinion rages. The most insightful and sophisticated contribution so far is, of course, from Jeremy Clarkson: 'I never find it touching when men cry. I just think they are gay.' </p> <p>What does Jeremy think of the modern outbreak of men crying in public? 'Modern and gay.' </p> <p>What did Jeremy think when he himself shed a tear while watching Educating Rita? 'I thought I might be a bit homosexual.' </p> <p>Homosexual I don't know. Preoccupied, certainly. Don't worry Jeremy, you are 100 per cent straight! Now hurry back to polishing that lovely long powerful sports car. </p> <p>Beckham was ridiculed all round for those tears - but only, I think, because he hasn't been doing well recently. He missed penalties in the big cup thing. Then England lost an important match when they had some goals but the other side got one because Dave Something in the net didn't catch it. Or maybe it was a draw. (Yes, I have been moonlighting as a sports reporter.) </p> <p>Nobody minded when Matthew Pinsent cried after getting his gold medal, but they don't want to see a loser crying. Tragically, England's famous affection for losers and underdogs is on the wane. </p> <p>When I was at primary school I was in 'Scott House'. They were inspiring our young minds, in classic Brit style, with the story of a man who set out with a big ambition, failed, came last and died. Froze to death a failure. Go get 'em, Tiger! But nobody talks about Captain Scott any more. My old school house has been renamed after Florence Nightingale. </p> <p>How we loved Tim Henman a few years ago when he struggled, got close and missed. As Viz comic so neatly put it: 'WE'RE BACKING TIM ALL THE WAY! (To the semi-final).' Terribly English. But we don't love Tim Henman any more. Why? Bored of him losing. We've gone all bling-bling and success-dazzled; the kids want fame and 'respect'; we have lost the glory of coming second. Or last. </p> <p>Next weekend, Wimbledon (starring Paul Bettany) finally opens. This is the film they were shooting last year about 'the first Englishman to win Wimbledon since Fred Perry'. Apparently producers were fervently hoping that Tim Henman would not win the men's singles title, as this would spoil the story. Pretty safe bet there, eh lads? </p> <p>Meanwhile I am fervently hoping that reports are wrong and Paul Bettany does not win the title at the end of this new film. I know that these people have to sell their movie to America, but can't we do the patriotic thing and sell them a classic, doomed, hapless English hero? A Del Boy, a Charles Pooter, an Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards? Have we forgotten what we do best? </p> <p>Nick Hornby has just bought a \u00a33 million house near the Arsenal ground. (He has only himself to blame. Before Nick Hornby came along, you could buy a \u00a3300,000 house near the Arsenal ground.) His brilliant Fever Pitch was all about embracing the constant pain and disappointment and rainy anti-climax of supporting an English football team. But nobody supports those teams any more. Arsenal are popular because they never lose anything. The teams who don't win cups have been sloughed off into their own special non-televised league so they're barely part of football any more. </p> <p>What next? Sitcoms about rag-and-bone men who are really happy and successful? The scariest thing about this Wimbledon storyline is the idea that the hero can only be sexy if he comes out a winner. I have never understood this concept of 'drive, ambition, power and success' being attractive qualities in a man (as you would know if you had ever met any of my boyfriends). I find these characteristics threatening, transatlantic and slightly embarrassing. </p> <p>Time was when films were all about women being lucky enough to snare a successful man. Hollywood producers seem to think it's a revolution for modern screen heroines to be successful as well, but a real revolution would be if nobody was successful at all. Jerry Maguire is supposed to be a movie about showing heart and prioritising love over money - but it still ends with Cuba Gooding Jnr becoming the highest-paid running back in the NFL. And his wife is delighted. </p> <p>How depressing that British culture is heading in that direction. We are simply becoming shorter, gloomier, wetter, go-getting Americans. Meanwhile, the enlightened people of China have put Jane Eyre on the national reading list to 'teach children about passion'. It is of course a novel where the sex only starts when the hero's gone blind and his house has burned down. </p> <p>Now that's what I call a love story.</p>",
  "<p>The Northlake subdivision of Georgetown, some 45 minutes north of Austin, Texas, is as quiet as quiet can be. These few wide streets, named after native American tribes, are roads to nowhere; a driver has no business here unless he is a resident or a visitor. The houses - low-slung, wooden affairs with porches and swings and basketball hoops - are set back from the road and languish in several acres. Out front, on expansive drives and behind picket fences, you see the usual shiny SUVs (Chevys so big, you could live in them) but only rarely their owners, especially on weekdays. Most people here commute into Austin every morning, where they have jobs in the hi-tech industries that have brought the city fresh affluence. A dog barks. Crickets whirr. Otherwise, the only sound to be heard is that of the raspy Texas wind blowing through the long grass. </p> <p>Until last month, number 224, Navajo Trail was home to the Cooke family. They had their dream house built almost two decades ago, to their own specifications, and loved it for its tranquillity and spaciousness. Robert, like his neighbours, is a commuter; he is a software engineer for IBM. Janet teaches English at a nearby high school. Northlake, they decided, was a good place in which to bring up their two daughters, Rachel and JoAnn. Robert comes from a big, close-knit Texas family, and Navajo Trail was soon the holiday destination of choice for his relatives. On Labour Day and at Thanksgiving, the clan would celebrate with a big barbecue in the Cookes' very own three acres. 'It was wonderful,' says Robert's sister, Elaine Hettenhausen, as we drive by the house. 'It was in the countryside, a real low crime area, and the girls had their own bedrooms.' She slows down the car. 'See the fence? Janet built that herself, the traditional way.' </p> <p>But this idyll came to a dramatic end on Thursday, 10 January 2002, a day which began - as all the worst days do - like any other. As usual, Robert and Janet both left early for work, and their younger daughter, JoAnn, went off to high school. Only their elder daughter, Rachel, stayed behind at home. Rachel, 19, was a freshman student at Mesa Junior College in San Diego, and had been home for the holidays. Her plan now was to attend her cousin's wedding on 12 January, and then head back to California to join her boyfriend of several months, Greg. When the family left her, she was asleep on the living room sofa. Her father, a big man with haunted eyes, remembers that she complained a little at being woken up by all the human traffic. Like all students everywhere, she wanted to lie in, to enjoy her last days of freedom. 'She wanted to be a fashion designer,' he says, with a smile. In some ways, it wasn't like her to want to sleep: 'Rachel was one of those people for whom there are never enough hours in the day.' </p> <p>That Thursday, Robert did not hear from his daughter, which was strange - she always found some excuse to call - and when he arrived home, a little before five, she was not there. Still, he was not unduly worried. He knew that she had planned to go out with a girlfriend that evening; perhaps Shannon had already come by, picked her up. Later, though, he called Shannon. It turned out that she had not heard from Rachel at all. More calls were made. Robert rang Wildfire, a chi-chi local restaurant where Rachel sometimes worked for pocket money, and was relieved to hear that, yes, Rachel had done a shift that evening. It wasn't until the following morning, when there was still no sign of their daughter, that he found out from the night shift manager that he had been misinformed. The Rachel in question was not his child. He now knew something was terribly wrong. </p> <p>'At this point, Janet went to the hospital to see if any unidentified females had come in,' says Robert. 'And I drove Rachel's jogging route because, by this time, we had figured out that the only things that were missing were her running clothes.' At two o'clock, he and Janet met at the sheriff's office where they turned in a missing persons' report. Rachel, an accomplished cross-country runner, ran four miles every day, taking her regular route around the quiet roads of the Northlake subdivision. This particular day, her family believe, she must have left the house mid-morning; they know she spoke to Greg on the telephone at 9.15am. She was wearing a green vest, grey shorts and Asics trainers. In her hand was a yellow Walkman. Around 11am, she ran past a neigh bour's drive; he recalls seeing Rachel as he backed up his car. After this, there are no more reported sightings. Robert and Janet Cooke's beloved daughter had simply disappeared into thin air. And so, the searching began. The sheriff's search, beefed up with the help of hundreds of volunteers, lasted only until Monday. After that, the Cookes brought in Texas EquuSearch, a mounted search and recovery team run by Tim Miller, whose daughter Laura was abducted and murdered in 1984. Miller's search lasted two weeks. </p> <p>'After that, I continued to run searches on weekends,' says Robert. 'We carried on for nine months. But at some point, we thought: we've done our best. If they took her 12 miles, there's no rea son why they shouldn't have taken her 15 miles. We could search the whole of Texas and still not find her.' Cooke relates all of this in the carefully neutral tone of one who has told the same story, over and over, and has learned to drain it of emotion. It is a hot day, and we are sitting by an Austin lake. Behind him, women his daughter's age are swimming. Every now and then, one of them will pull themselves out of the water and head off down the wooded paths at the side of the lake. In spite of the sunshine, and the crowds, I suddenly find that it is all I can do not to call after these lovely girls. 'Be careful,' I want to shout. 'Please don't go that way alone.' </p> <p>For me, this story begins in vanity (my own) and ends in humility (also my own). I stumbled across the story of Rachel Cooke's disappearance two months ago, on the internet. A couple of friends had come over to my house for dinner and we got to talking about Googling. They informed me that, these days, people not only use the world's best search engine to vet prospective dates; they use it to follow their own progress in life, too. Apparently, an acquaintance of ours has even published a novel about this. I spent the evening teasing my friends about their extreme narcissism but, naturally, no sooner had they hopped into their respective taxis than I ran upstairs and Googled myself. The first site that came up was the one set up by Robert Cooke to help return Rachel to her family. </p> <p>The site was so striking, and Rachel's story so troubling, that I never got beyond it. Soon after, I contacted Robert (for obvious reasons, I used my sister's email address rather than my own) and asked him if I might write about what had happened to his family. His reply was swift. On the first anniversary of the disappearance of his daughter, he told me, he had made her a vow: 'I promised her that I would find her, and I intend to do it. I don't want to let her be forgotten.' </p> <p>In the two years and nine months since he last saw Rachel, her father has learned - somewhat against his quiet nature - to be an extrovert, to talk to anyone who is willing to listen. He has become schooled in the way of sound bites, and adept at capturing the quicksilver interest of a fickle media. 'We are willing to do anything that can help bring Rachel back to us,' he told me. 'So I would love for you to write a piece about her.' Three weeks later, I flew to Austin to meet him. </p> <p>Even if I hadn't known of his loss, I might still have sensed that Cooke carries with him some unspeakable burden. He walks gingerly, in the manner of one who fears what may be around the next corner, and his face is a soft planet of shadows, those beneath his eyes being the darkest and most heart-breaking. He tells me that he is able to sleep, but I am not sure I believe him. I imagine, also, that he does not take the best care of himself, that he is a comfort eater (although, in this context, that expression seems horribly insulting). When I visited his house - he and Janet have now divorced, and he has finally moved out of Navajo Trail - it was still crammed with packing boxes. On a coffee table, however, he had placed the bare essentials: his mobile phone and laptop computer, from which he cannot be parted, and a big, exuberant tub of red liquorice. </p> <p>Since the searching stopped, Cooke has focused his attention on keeping his daughter's story in the media. He and other members of the family have appeared on television - notably on America's Most Wanted , a Fox show presented by John Walsh, whose son Adam was abducted and murdered in 1981 - and made the difficult decision to turn the anniversary of Rachel's disappearance into a media event, to be picked up by the local television news. Candlelit services, balloon releases, the sending out of white doves into the sky: sometimes, it is tough coming up with new ideas. The family also produces car bumper stickers and badges asking for help in finding Rachel, and a website, rachelcookesearch.org, where you can read her father's daily journal. Finally, the family has established the Rachel Alert Network, a charitable organisation which aims to prevent abductions through education and self-defence training, and which provides support and information to the friends and families of the missing. RAN recently published a fundraising cookbook, Recipes to Remember, which includes Robert's way with egg rolls and a dish called shrimp confetti from Janet. </p> <p>All of these activities help to keep Robert going, but, at bottom, he is sustained, even after all this time, by hope - however worn, however wizened. </p> <p>'I know someone took Rachel,' he says. 'I don't know exactly where they took her, or what they did with her, but I know she's probably not alive. I know that. We faced that a long time ago. There's a slim chance that she might be alive, that she hit her head and has amnesia, she's somewhere else, living as another person. But the chances are so slim. You don't want to get your hopes up. You have to be ready for that phone call. Any time they find unidentified human remains... it's really bad. One last year was found only nine miles from our house. That was the worst one.' </p> <p>Would a body give him some kind of relief? 'There's no answer. Part of me wants to find her no matter what. Another part hopes she is alive.' But he is growing painfully used to waiting for the results of DNA tests to come in; since Rachel disappeared, eight bodies have been found in or around his Williamson County home. </p> <p>America has a terrible missing persons problem. You might even call it a crisis. According to the FBI's National Crime Information Centre, there were 840,279 missing person entries in 2001 of which, horrifyingly, 85-95 per cent were juveniles. (In the UK, 200,000 people are reported missing every year, although the two figures are not properly comparable because they are compiled in different ways.) And this figure includes only those who have someone who cares enough to notice that they are gone; the reality could be far worse. But were you unaware of these numbers, the situation would still be impossible to ignore, even for the casual visitor. I do not visit America often but I was in the country when Chandra Levy, 24, a former federal intern, went missing (her disappearance in 2001 was widely reported thanks to her relationship with a congressman; her remains were found a year later in a Washington park). I was there, too, last year, when 27-year-old Laci Peterson disappeared in California (her husband, Scott, is now standing trial for her murder and that of her unborn child). And only last week, I saw the 'amber alert' signs on a Texas freeway asking drivers to look out for 12-year-old Jami Hicks from Mesquite, who had been abducted by her violent stepfather. (Jami is now safe and well.) </p> <p>Whether or not America's missing are ever found depends, to a frightening degree, on where they were living when they disappeared. There is no single clearing house for missing people in America, and not every law enforcement agency is connected to the relevant FBI computer - so even when remains are found, it may prove impossible to discover if they are those of a person registered as lost. Law enforcement in America is infuriatingly fractured. 'Every individual law enforcement agency has their own database,' says Robert Cooke. 'Each country within a state has several different law enforcement agencies; Texas alone has some 250 counties. Texas has a DNA database, and it can talk to the FBI database, but not every state has one and even if they do, it may not talk directly to the others. So someone may be found just 10 feet over a state line, and they may not be recognised.' His daughter's case was handled by the Williamson County Sheriff's department. 'It's a real small force: just the sheriff and a couple of deputies, and no specialists in cold case work.' </p> <p>When an adult goes missing, even a young adult, it can be hard to get the attention of the police. In America, the law has recently been changed so that anyone missing who is under the age of 18 now counts as a juvenile, and is therefore a priority; unfortunately for the Cookes, however, Rachel was 19. 'I'm currently working with the National Centre for Missing Adults on a training course for law enforcement agencies. I want them to look at each case individually, not just to go with the statistic that most adults leave on their own. If someone has a mistress or a lover, they may have gone of their own volition. But if such an action was against a person's nature, the police need to take their disappearance seriously right from the very start. It took us a while to convince them that she hadn't gone off on her own. The first deputy kept saying that she'd run off to Mexico with her boyfriend.' </p> <p>Robert advises relatives that it is important to act fast, even if the missing person is an adult. 'We thought there was a 24-hour waiting period before a missing persons report could be filed. Turns out that's a myth.' He also urges family members to try to rule themselves out as suspects as early as possible. 'I hired an ex-FBI profiler and he told me to request a polygraph test. It's an awful thing, but the family are always suspects. Polygraphs are not admissible in court, but if you volunteer, it can help move their attention on.' Finally, he thinks the more publicity a case gets, the better - though this is often easier said than done. 'They want blond, blue-eyed females. In the eyes of the media, there are strikes against you. If you're low income, male, belong to a minority or from a broken home, they won't touch you. The problem with Rachel was that she was just that little bit too old.' </p> <p>All of this stuff - so humdrum and yet so desperate - is very far from the way missing persons investigations are represented in the gritty-but-glamorous CBS television series, Without a Trace . </p> <p>The devastating effect that losing someone this way has on a family can not be overstated, and I struggle to find the right words to describe it. The Cookes now find themselves in a kind of mortal aspic, unable to move forwards, unable to go backwards, their lives on hold, their loss ever present, always running on an exhausting loop inside their heads. Robert regards himself as 'disabled', unable to function properly as a human being. </p> <p>'In some ways, it's harder now. A lot of the people who helped us have gone back to their normal lives, and we're still stuck with the nightmare.' </p> <p>Was his marriage a casualty? 'If you have a really good marriage going into something like this, you might be able to survive it. But if your marriage is at all shaky, it's just the last straw.' His heart clenches when he thinks of his surviving daughter JoAnn. Once, she called him late at night to say she had a puncture. As he drove to pick her up, he was beside himself with fear. </p> <p>Meanwhile, his ex-wife Janet has twice been admitted to psychiatric hospitals, where she was treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. 'I still see my shrink,' she says. 'And there are days when I don't want to get up, when I just want to stay in bed, when it hits me all over again. What keeps me going is that I need to be there for when she comes back. I prefer to keep on hoping even if I have to do that for another 20 years because Rachel was so precious to us. We brought her up right. This shouldn't have happened to her.' </p> <p>Even so, these days her hope is self-conscious, willed, rather than instinctive. 'She would have found a way back to us if she was still alive. I know it. The Navajos have a saying that a person's spirit lives on so long as somebody remembers them. Well, we have a lot of good memories.' </p> <p>Since Rachel disappeared, her younger sister has graduated from high school and is now a student at the University of Texas. Her parents are proud of the way she has coped but, clearly, it has not been easy. </p> <p>'Rachel was my best friend,' she says. 'We had the same mannerisms, the same sense of humour.' She tells me that she has not been able to develop many close friendships at university, and when people ask her if she has any siblings, she is uncertain what her response should be. She dreams about Rachel often. 'They're always very happy dreams. I say to my mom, \"See, I told you she wasn't gone!\" Then I wake up, and I have that same sense of loss all over again.' Rachel's boyfriend, Greg, a carpenter and musician, has not been on a date since he lost her. 'I can't find her in other girls, so I don't give them a second chance. I think about her all the time.' </p> <p>Over a Tex-Mex lunch, Rachel's aunt, Elaine, told me how she fears for her brother, who indulges in so much displacement activity, and worries about her niece, who is sometimes very quiet. Rachel's grandparents, she says, aged suddenly and dramatically after she disappeared, and seemed to lose both their innocence and, in the case of her mother, her religious faith, too. The family had already gathered for the wedding of Rachel's cousin when they finally discovered that she was missing, and Elaine will never forget the sight of her father standing outside her hotel room having taken a telephone call from Robert. His face was blank with disbelief. The wedding went ahead, without Robert, Janet and JoAnn, but she still does not know, quite, how they got through it. Rachel's uncle, a pastor, conducted the service. She shakes her head. </p> <p>By the lake in Austin, I ask Robert Cooke to tell me about his daughter. This is the only time in our conversation that his emotions get the better of him. He takes a deep breath, a sigh of both trepidation and longing, and then the words begin to spill out. </p> <p>'She was very outgoing. She used to sing all the time. She was a good worker. She lived life for the moment. She was a daredevil. She loved rollercoasters. As a little girl, she would always be standing on her tippy toes, trying to look taller. I never go for more than an hour without thinking of her, and sometimes I can't even go more than five minutes. It's a shame... It's a shame. That some low-life animal took her away, when she could have given the world so much.' </p> <p><strong>Lost and found in America...</strong></p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong> In March 2003, 15-year-old Elizabeth Smart, who had been abducted from Salt Lake City nine months earlier and was presumed dead, was rescued from a religious fanatic who forced her to wear a wig and veil. </p> <p> <strong> \u00b7 </strong>Scott Peterson told police that his wife Laci, a substitute teacher, vanished from their Modesto home on Christmas Eve 2002 when he was out fishing in San Francisco Bay, 90 miles from their home. Four months later her body was washed up close to the spot he had named. He currently stands trial accused of murdering her to be with his mistress. </p> <p> <strong> \u00b7 </strong>Washington intern 24-year-old Chandra Levy disappeared in May 2001 after revelations she had been having an affair with Democrat congressman Gary Conduit, which also lost him the congressional elections in California. Her body was found in a park a year later. A year of forensic tests failed to establish cause of death.</p>",
  "<p>One point each might not seem a disaster for two sides pushing for promotion, but a draw was far from an ideal result, particularly for West Ham, who missed a penalty after Malky Mackay had put them ahead and in control. Teddy Sheringham was the guilty man, shooting wide from the spot after Carl Fletcher had been taken down by Ipswich goalkeeper Kelvin Davis in the 34th minute, and his miss was the obvious turning point. </p> <p>Instead of the two-goal lead their superiority deserved, West Ham were deflated, while Ipswich knew they had been given a reprieve. They started to match West Ham's passion and passing, eventually equalised through Pablo Counago, and could have gone on to win, although Joe Royle conceded that all three points would have been unjust. 'We might have nicked it after we equalised but that would have been harsh on West Ham,' he said. 'They will see the penalty as the turning point, and if that had gone in we'd have reached half-time 2-0 down, whereas we were on a bit of a high after the miss.' </p> <p>Alan Pardew was keen to point out that his side's fortunes did not hinge on that single incident. 'We had plenty of chances before and after that,' he said, 'but their goalkeeper made some terrific saves, as he has done before against us. I'd like to think our heads didn't drop, but the boys are only human. We're disappointed and we'll be kicking ourselves about the chances that went begging.' </p> <p>Victory for either side would have taken them into second place, but results elsewhere meant Ipswich dropped to fourth and West Ham to fifth. The disappointment did not justify the outburst of booing from unhappy Hammers at the final whistle, however, and Pardew said: 'I wish the fans would remember the first half, when we were sublime at times, rather than the closing period.' </p> <p>It was not quite a game of two halves, but West Ham's first-half dominance diminished once Royle reminded his charges at half-time that graft is required alongside craft. West Ham started the game with a nice blend of those qualities, the guile of Sheringham and composure of Calum Davenport matched by the crisp tackling of Fletcher and willingness of wingers Matt Etherington and Luke Chadwick. </p> <p>They got their reward after an 11th-minute corner. Ipswich cleared their lines but Chris Powell put Chadwick in on the left and his cross was nodded over the line by former Norwich defender Mackay, who stooped to conquer for the third year running against his former club's fierce rivals. </p> <p>Marlon Harewood, who had a game to forget, volleyed over the bar when he had time to control the ball in front of an exposed goal, and Sheringham missed a simple header from close range. Nigel Reo-Coker's deflected shot was brilliantly saved by Davis, who matched that soon afterwards with a reflex save from Sheringham after another Mackay header was cleared off the line by Counago. </p> <p>Then came the penalty miss, and everything changed. Ipswich's best early chance had been a Darren Bent shot that Stephen Bywater saved with his legs. But the keeper then made superb saves to deny Tommy Miller twice before Ipswich equalised when Counago turned and shot home through a crowded penalty area following a corner in the 57th minute. </p> <p>When Bent curled a shot against the bar and Harewood failed to nod Etherington's cross over the line, both sides realised they would have to settle for a draw in the knowledge that they are still in contention at the top of the table. </p> <p>HREF=\"mailto: You can mail the Observer direct at\"<a sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Arsenal's bogey team got up their noses once again. Bolton Wanderers, and their manager Sam Allardyce, halted the champions' steamroller start to the season with a performance, which, as usual, showed scant regard for starry reputations. </p> <p>Arsenal led twice, but Bolton - well-organised, built like tanks and playing to their strengths - twice fought back with set pieces that had nerves in the home back four jangling all afternoon. As Allardyce admitted, the sheer size of his team is awfully difficult to keep at bay. </p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger responded, unusually for him, by criticising his defence as 'naive and passive'. By his standards of publically protecting his team that is a mighty rap on the knuckles. </p> <p>The case against the defence was epitomised when Bolton had the final say five minutes from time. Ricardo Gardner, inevitably, lofted a free kick high into the box and Kolo Tour\u00e9 allowed Les Ferdinand to glance the ball down for his partner Henrik Pedersen, who held off Pascal Cygan to create the room to dink an equaliser past the poorly positioned Jens Lehmann. 'We showed weakness in the air and we have to work on that,' said Wenger. </p> <p>Sol Campbell was out on the Highbury pitch an hour after the game was finished for light training. Arsenal can't have him back in the thick of it soon enough. </p> <p>The Londoners created more than enough chances to have made defensive slips little more than Bolton consolations. Thierry Henry could have had a hat-trick in the first half, but made do with one - an excellent finish it was too - after he exchanged passes with Patrick Vieira and sprang between Bruno N'Gotty and Nicky Hunt. The killer burst of pace set him up for a clipped finish with his left foot that beat Jussi Jaaskelainen. </p> <p>With Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes scampering dangerously for company, Arsenal looked in control until Allardyce shook the game up with a double substitution 10 minutes into the second half. 'We changed it early because we wanted to get behind them a bit more,' he explained. On came Ferdinand and Pedersen, who were instantly influential, changing the tone of the game. Within seconds Ferdinand was clattered by the ponderous Cygan, before Pedersen whipped a shot against the crossbar. </p> <p>Bolton suddenly burned with fire in their belly and pushed Arsenal on to the back foot. Cygan's floundering performance only emphasised what a bargain Allardyce has unearthed in Tunisian centre-back Radhi Jaidi on a free transfer. Composed, athletic and uncompromising, Jaidi is making a name for himself already, all the more so after he popped up at a corner with a thumping header to level. </p> <p>Arsenal were cursing their man-marking and to compound matters Lehmann rushed off his line but flapped at the ball. They recovered to storm back into the lead three minutes later. Reyes's quick thinking sent Freddie Ljungberg scampering down the right flank and when the Swede's cross skidded across the face of goal, Pires arrived to scoop it past Jaaskelainen. </p> <p>If Allardyce was disappointed by that, he was livid minutes later when Gardner was penalised for fouling Ljungberg. Big Sam over-reacted, virtually clumping fourth official Dermot Gallagher such was his ire. </p> <p>He was far happier five minutes from time, though, when Pedersen was flapping his arms in celebration. The Dane came off the bench to do the same last season at the Reebok and the home fans felt a similar sense of deflation and frustration that Bolton had pegged them back again. They still haven't forgotten the 2-2 draw two seasons ago that effectively cost them the championship. </p> <p>'To come back twice at Highbury is no mean feat and shows the quality of the squad and the spirit of the team,' purred Allardyce, who re-iterated his desire to continue his work with a team who continue to astonish. </p> <p>Nevertheless Wenger looked decidedly down in the dumps afterwards. God forbid that Arsenal should actually lose a game. </p> <p><strong>Man of the match:</strong> Rahdi Jaidi - the defender is a real find for Bolton. 'He was so keen he virtually ran over here,' said manager Sam Allardyce of his latest Tunisian signing. A smooth performer, the big defender barely put a foot wrong all afternoon, and capped his performance by scoring a firm header. </p> <p>HREF=\"mailto: You can mail the Observer direct at\"<a sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Paul Sturrock has done a lot of thinking in the four weeks since the curtain came down on his troubled spell as a Premiership manager, after just 13 matches and five months, at Southampton. Many believe he was hard done by; that even Ars\u00e8ne Wenger might have struggled to overcome the obstacles that confronted him. But Sturrock's conclusion is upbeat: 'The experience will prove beneficial to me in the long run.' he says. </p> <p>'Having been able to look into the goldfish bowl over the last few weeks, as opposed to being in it, I can see that I made some mistakes - there's no doubt about that. But I know that these can only help make me stronger. I know that have the ability to do well, even in the Premiership.' </p> <p>Among the most important lessons learned at St Mary's, says Sturrock, was how to communicate with Premiership players - particularly over changes to the team's style of play. 'The standard of Premiership players is higher than those in the Football League, but they can be very strong-minded - they have to be to deal with the pressures at this level - and I think you have to take more care in how you deal with some of them. </p> <p>'During my own playing career, the top managers like Jim McLean [his boss at Dundee United] and Alex Ferguson didn't worry too much about that. It's different now. The ego factor with top-flight players today is more pronounced. They have greater power and generally you can't afford to be as rough-handed with them as you can with the pros in the Football League. </p> <p>'At Southampton, there was a suggestion that I was trying to turn them into a hit-and-hope long-ball team, especially when I signed Peter Crouch from Aston Villa. That was a myth. A lot of teams pass the ball from the back to the front, straight up to their main striker - Manchester United do it. You have to retain possession in the Premiership, I appreciate that, but I felt that once we got within 25 yards of the goal, we needed to be more positive and produce a greater number of crosses and forward passes. </p> <p>'Early on, I possibly didn't get this across to the players as well as I could have done. One of the things I learned at Southampton, and I learned it very quickly, was Premiership players expect more individual attention. You have to have more one-on-ones with them.' </p> <p>So why, having stepped into the Premiership for the first time at the age of 47, was he given so little time to adjust? 'It wasn't as if results were that bad,' Sturrock points out. 'And at the time I left I really felt I was getting to grips with things.' </p> <p>He declines to make any comment on reports of problems in his relationship with the coaching staff he inherited, or with the chairman, Rupert Lowe (who bizarrely was reported to have criticised his appearance). But he does not deny that he faced a general credibility problem that became increasingly difficult to shake off. </p> <p>'I was tarred with a certain brush. When I landed the job, I'm sure some people looked upon me as a virtual nobody just up from the sticks. I think it started with one or two dissatisfied players making critical comments to their agents and these being leaked to the media. The whole thing just mushroomed and got out of control.' </p> <p>Sturrock, who claims that he was not sacked ('My departure was a mutual decision as much as anything') had known for some time that he was fighting a losing battle to establish himself at Southampton - even when he moved his family to the area the week before the parting of the ways to ensure that he honoured his contract. That happened on the Monday; by the following Monday he was back on the phone to the removal company to arrange for them to take all their furniture and belongings back to Plymouth. </p> <p>He lives 800 yards from Argyle's Home Park stadium, and most mornings jogs around the ground. It is not unusual for him to come across his successor Bobby Williamson, the fellow Scot whom he recommended for the post, and for the two men to chew the fat. But strange as it might seem for a man who was arguably the most successful manager in Argyle's history, being seen inside the ground during Plymouth's matches is something he has avoided. 'In view of how recently I worked there, I think that would be inappropriate,' he says. Hence the fact that last Tuesday night, instead of attending one of their biggest home games, against Leeds, Sturrock watched Arsenal's Champions League tie on TV. 'If I want to go and see a match live, I go to places like Torquay,' he says.</p> <p>A year ago Sturrock was being talked of as a potential managerial giant. He was even being touted as a possible Scotland manager. Now, it could take him some time to go anywhere in English football without being perceived as having had ideas above his station and fallen on his face. But as he attempts to resurrect his career back in the Football League ('Find a job where I can, get my hands dirty again'), he says he is no way traumatised by what happened to him at the top end of the scale. 'I am probably a better manager now than I was when I joined Southampton,' he says. 'No matter how experienced you might be, there is always something to learn. Being with Southampton was a tremendous learning curve for me. People say: \"Haven't you lost a bit of confidence in your ability?\" The answer is no - quite the reverse.' </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Kevin Keegan apparently skates on the thinnest of ice at Manchester City, Gary Megson is at odds with the West Bromwich Albion chairman and both managers could depart their clubs in the next few days. For their batty, beleaguered kind, this has been the most precarious start to a season in the history of the Premiership; an unlucky 13 seasons for some 'supremos'. </p> <p>Already Paul Sturrock has gone from Southampton and Sir Bobby Robson from Newcastle, the latter to be replaced by Graeme Souness from Blackburn, where Mark Hughes has taken over. The word is that should Keegan go, Bolton's Sam Allardyce will be invited to replace him, while Sir Bobby could resurface at Albion. It is not so much a merry-go-round as a queue for the human cannonball. </p> <p>Managers have always got the sack or left for better jobs. Since the Premiership's inception, there had been 85 managerial changes up until the start of this campaign, which represents an average of seven a season. The total number of changes in English football's top four divisions last year was 46 - exactly half of the clubs. </p> <p>It is an astonishing number, the more so in the light of research a couple of years ago that showed that the results of a club changing manager improve for an average of eight games before frequently returning to their norm. Every club is looking to be the exception, however. </p> <p>What has been different this season has been the swiftness - a euphemism for panic, perhaps - with which clubs have acted. Before this season, only five of the 85 Premiership changes were made before the end of August and none for the past four years. Sturrock and Sir Bobby were gone after two and four league games respectively. </p> <p>It is happening at all levels, too. Mark Wright departed Chester in August, though seemingly as a result of internal club disputes, and Craig Brown has gone from Preston. In the Conference, Forest Green's seven straight defeats have seen the back of Tim Harris while Peter Nicholas, the former Crystal Palace and Wales player, was sacked from Newport County, having failed to live up to pre-season expectation. </p> <p>That, indeed, is the downfall of many a hapless manager whose chairman and board believe they should be better than they are, no matter how much better the opposition have become. Patience in football now seems to be a vice. </p> <p>As Paul Sturrock outlines in a fascinating interview for <em>The Observer</em>, his problem may well have been in not understanding quickly enough the psyche of a Premiership player compared to those in the Football League. It does not augur well for any manager seeking to step up, with other Premiership clubs even less likely now to recruit from below. </p> <p>Rather than simply sacking, however, would it not have made some sense for the Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe to talk over any problems with Sturrock to see if there might be some resolution? Sturrock might then have learned the lessons in the job rather than out of it and gone on to become a good Premiership manager. </p> <p>It is depressing, though the reality of the modern game is that if a manager 'loses' a dressing room, he now seems to be out, such is the power wielded by players on long, expensive contracts who are more difficult to ease out. Keegan is rumoured to have lost City's collection of underperforming big-earners; Robson unable to keep in check some immature talents at St James' Park. </p> <p>It can make you angry. Keegan, Sir Bobby - and add to the list G\u00e9rard Houllier - have made one serious mistake, it seems. They are enlightened empowerers of players, men who admire and even like top-quality performers - rarer than might be imagined among managers. They cut players too much slack, treated them like adult professionals and were rewarded by a lack of dedication from certain of them. </p> <p>Naturally, the antidote in Newcastle's case is Souness, supposedly a tough disciplinarian. We will see how, after the honeymoon, the players respond. Watching his arrival, incidentally, reminded you of the truism that managers arrive as they depart: fired with enthusiasm. </p> <p>In all this, chairmen seem to be a bit like newspaper editors in knowing what they want. And what they want is what another club, or paper, has. Some boards want a stickler, some want a soother. And it never ceases to surprise me that they do not do their homework properly before making the appointment that is most crucial in any club. Did Lowe not know what he was getting with Sturrock? </p> <p>Now a new trend is developing. Souness, like Hughes, has a two-year contract with a year rolling. In other words, if a board is unhappy with him after a mere two seasons, they only have to negotiate a year's pay-off to get rid of him. </p> <p>It used to be that wise leaders adopted an almost predictable pattern in football: the first year to assess and modify the playing squad, the second improving it the way the manager wants, the third to challenge for honours. Then a fourth and fifth to hone and enjoy the ripening of a team. </p> <p>What happened to leaders backing their judgment of the game and keeping their nerve and their heads when all about - notably the mob who bray on phone-ins and websites - were losing theirs? I am with the boards at Birmingham and Crystal Palace in securing Steve Bruce and Iain Dowie on long-term contracts. </p> <p>That way, a manager feels secure and surely managers operate best in secure, rather than insecure, environments. Besides, Bruce and Dowie are likely always to be in demand during the terms of those contracts. It makes sound business sense to have a talented manager tied down so that the club is due some serious compensation should he be enticed away with the agreement of all parties. </p> <p>It seems to be old-fashioned now to point out the virtues of sticking with a manager - if he wants to stay, that is. Crewe have overachieved for a decade under Dario Gradi, Charlton under Alan Curbishley. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson are not exactly fly-by-nights. But then Fergie has lost the plot, has been losing it for a few seasons now, as the FA Cup last season and the signings of Rio Ferdinand, Cristiano Ronaldo, Alan Smith and Wayne Rooney show. </p> <p>A forlorn hope, I suppose, that the sacking season has merely arrived, and ended, early. And that the lessons of the longest-serving are heeded, realism thus returning to a sometimes shabby game. Probably.

  "There was one nervous moment on Richard and Judy, when Judy almost choked on a cookie moments before the star guest arrived. Otherwise, Cherie Booth's first television interview, to publicise her history of prime minister's wives, went well. This seemed to surprise some critics, though it is not clear why. <p>Ms Booth is a leading QC used to cross-examination. Richard and Judy are as adversarial as candyfloss. What problem could there be? One explanation for the suspicion that things could go awry is a belief that Ms Booth is a woman barely in possession of all her marbles, let alone her juggling balls. </p> <p>Never has a Number 10 spouse placed so much faith in mumbo jumbo therapies, the curative properties of strawberry leaves grown in Neolithic stone circles or Greg Dyke's ability to keep quiet about being asked to blag a cheap Manchester United football shirt. There was another reason for the interest in Richard and Judy . The sight of a walking, talking Mrs Blair is still a novelty for voters used to seeing her wheeled out, like Brezhnev in his dotage, for silent cameos. </p> <p>She is an excellent speaker, but the public cannot know that. The media baulk at being frozen out. The culmination has been a frenzy of dislike, much of it cruel and most of it unnecessary. Part of it is Ms Booth's fault. Being bankrolled by Berlusconi is unforgivable. Cheriegate stank. Buying shoes on e-Bay and yawning in the presence of royalty are attractive traits, but they were never enough. What Cherie Booth needed was a profile and now she has got one. </p> <p>As a consequence, something remarkable has happened. Suddenly, she is one of the most popular public figures in Britain. Women columnists are writing eulogies and even the Daily Mail is less barbed. Ms Booth has not connived at a burnished image by serving soup to the homeless. All she has done is to co-write and promote a book produced by virtue of her position. Next up is a lucrative lecture tour of America. </p> <p>Though there is nothing wrong with this, her tactics should, in theory, make her more unpopular, not less. Nor has the public learned much about her, apart from inferring that she thinks it a bit rich that British first wives should have to scrub their own baths. One explanation for the We Love Cherie moodswing is that, far from being a semi-deranged freeloader, she seems very nice. Obviously, publicity cannot work miracles. Marie Antoinette arguing for cake all round on Parkinson, had such a tactic been available, might not have changed revolutionary history. </p> <p>But the media can iron out false impressions. Booth's champions argue that this bogus picture was spawned in the first place by a media that hate successful women. That is untrue, and so is Cherie's conclusion on Richard and Judy that the women writers (Judy excepted) who revile her may do so under orders from men. No male executive from any newspaper would dare sidle up to anyone I know, asking for a piece about how Cherie's hips are 'as wide as the Walworth Road'. </p> <p>Cherie Booth forfeited the popularity she should have enjoyed not through female spite, but because of her cipher status. Advised, or compelled, to stay quiet, she lost the contours of a feminist lawyer and a mother and took on the persona of Roosevelt's second wife, Edith, who announced that 'a lady's name should appear in print only three times - at her birth, marriage and death'. In a century when reticence is a deadly sin, Booth became a coathanger on which every animosity could be draped. </p> <p>There were understandable reasons for the purdah. Glenys Kinnock, though a wonderful advocate for women, had been pilloried. Still, times had changed. As Fiona Millar, Booth's one-time adviser wrote last week, clever, feisty women do not frighten voters. </p> <p>Besides, omerta was always bound to backfire. Philip Stephens, the Financial Times journalist and author, was perplexed, as he writes in the New Statesman, to be told curtly that Mrs Blair never gave interviews, despite evidence to the contrary in Marie Claire 's Lippygate, in which Cherie slipped her minders and posed in the marital bedroom, having her make-up applied by Carole Caplin. </p> <p>Isolation corrodes perspective. When Ms Booth finally rebelled at the restrictions placed on her, she lurched naively into unwise actions and friendships. That is how people behave when they have been severed from the real world. In a partial mea culpa, Millar admitted in the Guardian that the old advisers had been too nervous and too controlling. She also says that a Telegraph interview, in which Cherie divulged nothing much, confirmed her view that talking to the press while at Number 10 'was rather a pointless exercise'. </p> <p>But, much as interviewers welcome revelations, they mostly settle happily for less. There are different shades of silence, and Ms Booth was always going to be expert at repelling impertinent questions about private matters. Having charmed Richard and Judy, no inexorable law decrees that the next stop is Ant and Dec. Far from entailing nemesis, a media profile is, as Millar fails to acknowledge, essential. There is no other way of allowing the public to layer flesh on bones and humanity on myth. Millar, a journalist herself, should have known that, and perhaps, at some level, she did. For years, the silencing of Cherie fed rumours, rather than stemming them. This week's assertion by Lord Bragg that a grave family crisis almost led the Prime Minister to stand down would once have festered on for many weeks. This time, Ms Booth was able to crush Bragg on live TV, while stating that there never was a resigning moment. She has invested a great deal in her husband's career. Like Trollope's Duchess of Omnium, she might find the end of a premiership harder to withstand than he would. How gratifying it must be to be able to slap down Bragg's claims. </p> <p>The question is where the Cherie roadshow goes from here. Millar argues that we need a sensible consensus on what being a prime minister's spouse involves and, up to a point, we do. By all means have administrative staff and a modest clothing allowance, but not help with cooks and cleaners. Affluent couples living rent-free, like the Blairs, can provide those for themselves. </p> <p>Besides, cash involves pay-backs and binds a first wife to a husband's job. A formalised role would suit women who want to be dutiful adjuncts but not those who work, maybe in jobs less flexible than Booth's. But the lesson of her incumbency is not about money or public role. It is about how someone whose experience of birth, loss, teenage angst and family compromise made her closer than any predecessor in history to ordinary women. And about how she was rendered a stranger to them by officious management and her own compliance. </p> <p>The error, luckily is rectifiable faster than you can say Max Clifford. Half on hour on Richard and Judy did more for Cherie than her advisers achieved in seven years. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@observer.co.uk\">mary.riddell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Guests toyed with their bread and the waiters resisted serving the sliced cheese and tomato starter. At last, the main doors swung open and all heads turned as Dariga Nazarbayeva took her place at the head of the table. <p>'It is like a suicide to be so late for a meeting with journalists,' she smiled, making eye contact with the international press, all armed with questions about the political corruption that has dogged Kazakhstan since independence from the collapsed Soviet Union. </p> <p>Three hours later, as the last of five courses was digested, the group had been reduced to quivering admiration. An Italian journalist was overwhelmed when Dariga spoke his native tongue. An English reporter rose to his feet and toasted the hostess. Her gently flirtatious magic had an Indian writer eating out of her hand. </p> <p>Nazarbayeva - opera singer, media mogul and grandmother - gave a performance worthy of Margaret Thatcher, whom she regards as a role model alongside Indira Gandhi. Today she may also be about to reach the front line of domestic politics. Victory in Kazakhstan's parliamentary elections would catapult her from obscurity to become the most powerful woman in all the former Soviet republics. </p> <p>But there is a catch preventing reformers hailing Dariga as leading a social revolution in central Asia. Her father is President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled Kazakhstan for 15 years amid allegations of beatings of political opponents and fierce press suppression. Far from providing a democratic alternative, Dariga does not oppose her father on policy, merely wishing to replace the party apparatchiks surrounding him with her own. </p> <p>This is the peculiar universe of Kazakh politics, where the authoritarian Nazarbayev, 63, lacking a male heir but with three daughters, is in no hurry to make a King Lear-style gift of the world's ninth-largest country. A keen sportsman with an iron handshake, he has already declared his candidacy for the presidential election in 2006, and Dariga's 'rival' party has pledged to support him, sealing his position until at least 2013. In this context, the credibility of today's parliamentary poll is under severe scrutiny, aggravated by allegations of media bias, electronic voting manipulation and intimidation. </p> <p>None of this unduly troubles Dariga, who could become parliamentary speaker if the Asar ('Together') party, which she founded a year ago, defeats her father's ruling Otan ('Fatherland') party. Opinion polls put them neck-and-neck among the nation's 8.4 million voters, comfortably ahead of the other eight contenders. Critics of the president say he is using a mock opposition to split the vote of his real opponents, and is grooming Dariga as his successor to preserve his dynasty and save himself from prosecution once out of office. But Dariga is insistent she will be an authentic thorn in her father's side. </p> <p>'I was not forced to found this party,' she said. 'It was the independent decision of a 40-year-old woman with three children and a small grandchild. I have a PhD in history but there comes a moment when just to observe is dull because there is a a self-satisfaction in the pro-presidential camp which can turn to stagnation. The business and political elite is in crisis. </p> <p>'My father tried to convince me not to do this. He said: \"This is a very hard job. You will get old too soon.\" But when I discussed with him my vision of his party, I told him: \"I will be dealing with your team.\" I want to take away this piece of cake from his party. The new party will involve real people, not state officials.' </p> <p>The President might not have faced such rebellion had he allowed Dariga to follow her heart 20 years ago. 'I wanted to leave Moscow State University for the Moscow Conservatory to sing, but my father told me: \"Singing is not a profession.\" Sometimes I regret it: if I hadn't listened maybe I would now be at La Scala and not causing him problems.' </p> <p>Her husband is ambassador to Austria and a football promoter, and her father-in-law is a national hero for his contributions to surgery. She denies presidential ambitions of her own, but was director of the national television news agency and is outspoken on international affairs and determined to ease Kazakhstan's dash to capitalism. </p> <p>'Imagine what it's like waking up one morning in a system you were taught to despise,' she added. 'About 40 per cent of people here still yearn for the Soviet system,' she added. 'But the younger generation is different. When my son asks, \"Who is Mr Lenin?\" it's very hard to explain.' </p> <p>Yet there are echoes of the Soviet Union, China and North Korea in the city Nazarbayev is constructing as his new capital. Astana, as he renamed it, is dominated by eerily deserted plazas, monumental buildings and skyscrapers and is set on the flat, mosquito-plagued windswept steppe, where temperatures reach 40C in the summer and plummet to -40C in winter. Although the 71,000-acre city oasis is an expression of one man's ego, he is more subtle than other autocrats in the region, stopping short of erecting statues in his own image. </p> <p>Some \u00a314 billion has been spent on Astana, with a further \u00a37bn forecast for the next three years, as the President creates 'a masterpiece of world architecture'. He has enlisted architects from America, Italy and Turkey, and Britain's Sir Norman Foster is creating a 'Palace of Peace', a pyramid 100 metres tall. </p> <p>Accused of human rights abuses and a bribery scandal in the US, Nazarbayev is regarded as a benign dictator by the standards of neighbours such as Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Despite 120 ethnic groups and 45 religious denominations, the country has little instability and no significant terrorism. Its economic health outstrips its neighbours and, on some measures, even Russia. Between now and 2015, Kazakhstan plans to massively expand production of uranium, coal, gas and oil. The country's projected GDP next year is $44.5 billion (\u00a324.8bn). </p> <p>Nurtai Abykayev, chair of the senate, summed up the regime's logic: 'In the first year of Kazakhstan's independence it was important to keep the strong power to ensure the country was on the right path. Now our economic performance is way ahead of other former Soviet republics. If the state continues to make the right policy, parties will say they are oppositional but will continue to support the president. There will be no space for criticism.' </p> <p>But last month a report by Human Rights Watch found the government 'has a history of manipulating elections' and was guilty of persecuting opposition, jailing one party leader after an unfair trial. Media intimidation is another concern. A journalist who covered political corruption was killed by a car while crossing a street. The president has decreed that press criticism 'must be preceded by positive information on how fast we are developing'. </p> <p>Andrei Grishin, deputy director of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Law Observation, has a view far removed from Dariga's easy confidence. </p> <p>'There's a lot of pressure: vote for Otan or lose your jobs, especially in the countryside, where turnout is higher,' he said. 'Generally things are improving. You still get beaten - but not as badly.'</p>",
  "Call them Cowboy (and Cowgirl) Conservatives. They're young and hip, and breeze into town to shake things up, get things done - all without showing any deference to government or bigwigs. These youngsters have no time for the archetypal Tory, the colonel or the county squire, rooted in hierarchy, steeped in tradition, paralysed by nostalgia. Instead, they look across the Atlantic to find their icon - the Lone Ranger - and their attitude. <p>The Conservative old guard is essentially pessimistic, a pessimism rooted in sensing that the way we were was better, and risks being lost forever. Among the new wave of centre-rightists, this pessimism gives way to an all-American optimism. Just as Ronald Reagan and Bush Snr never allowed little local difficulties like Iran-Contra or Iraq to dent their enthusiastic faith in the ultimate triumph of the right, so today's young Conservatives will not allow a few problems like the ever widening gap between rich and poor or the growing number of permanently jobless to distract them from their optimism. They don't waste time worrying about the poor or minority rights; but in their laissez faire attitude there is not whiff of racism and bigotry. Rather, it is dictated by a belief that cheerful self-interest is something we should all embark on, as the best route to wealth redistribution is wealth creation. </p> <p>Today's young Conservatives are libertarians \u00e0 la Otis Ferry, who want the state to keep its grubby hands off their lives because, hey, they know what they want and how to get it. They may be loosely affiliated to the Wave Network - a group of twenty- and thirtysomethings who published a manifesto of sorts; or they may feel affinities with the Notting Hill set - personified by Rachel Whetstone, Michael Howard's political secretary - the trendy young Tories who want a more libertarian agenda within the party. </p> <p>But these young men and women certainly don't buy into the old Tory pillars of family, church and a homogeneous little England. These youngsters know about divorced parents, working mums and Sundays spent shopping rather than worshipping, so they are left cold by Tory talk of a better yesterday or back to basics. </p> <p>It's a political attitude found on both sides of the Atlantic. When the Economist 's John Micklethwait (an Oxbridge-polished libertarian conservative) toured America for his book, The Right Nation (out tomorrow), he and co-author Adrian Wooldridge found that for millions of young Americans 'conservatism is a progressive creed. It is not about old people trying to cling on to things, but about young people trying to change them'. The issues that exercise the right-wing young in America - ban abortion, stop gun control, ditch the UN - are not ones to engage the right over here. </p> <p>But, Micklethwait tells me, there are similarities in that both American and British Conservatives in their 20s and 30s share a more tolerant approach to homosexuality, divorce, and a multiracial society. In America, this laid-back libertarianism has been nailed down by the Schwarzenegger wing of the Republicans: a tax-cutting, pro-business agenda that leaves morality out of the equation. In Britain, Tony Blair stole the mantle of moral authority from the Tories in 1997, but never managed to nail down the libertarian votes. So far, neither has Howard. The young Conservative Cowboys remind us that a lot of enthusiasm and energy, as well as a lot of votes, are still up for grabs.</p> <p><b> Guns and poses</b></p> <p>Boris Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch exiled in Britain, comes to lunch at the New Statesman - along with four goons. Three stay downstairs in reception, keeping the gawping security guard company; the fourth follows the diminutive multimillionaire as he strides through our offices. The NS has hosted every cabinet and many a shadow minister for lunch, so the staff feel affronted that our security is not deemed foolproof by the Russian. Chairman Geoffrey Robinson's PA, Dr Elizabeth MacFarlane (only at the New Statesman does one have to have a PhD to act as personal assistant), takes Berezovsky's briefcase, then spots the machine pistol nestling uncomfortably in the folds of the bodyguard's suit, and ventures helpfully: 'May I assist you with your gun?' 'That won't be necessary,' snaps the goon. But the rest of the staff weren't very impressed with all this tough talk. The bodyguard may have checked the boardroom and newsroom thoroughly, but his 'sweep' missed our perfectly obvious back door, through which staff members who were not at the lunch filed out to the pub. </p> <p><b> Cherie's no match for Sarah</b><br> </p> <p>The Cherie Blair saga - freebies, holidays with Berlusconi, unsuitable chums - brings to mind the adage that it's not what you know, it's who you know. Clearly, Cherie's parochial existence before her husband came to prominence was spent among lawyers, backbench MPs and other humdrum individuals. She found herself ill-equipped for a life among the rich and famous. When confronted with either, the eloquent QC becomes a na\u00efve schoolgirl. The same could not be said of Sarah Brown, the Chancellor's wife. Her career as a PR entrepreneur offered her 24/7 exposure to the great and the good, and inoculated her against the heady allure of glamour. Sarah Brown is, because of the people she's come across, on her guard. She knows the moneybags, and how they try to buy your favour; she knows the sex-bomb wannabes who gush that you're so great looking, if only you'd put yourself in their hands you'd be a stunner. If your friends include Rory Bremner, Arabella Weir and Mariella Frostrup before you walk into Number 10, then no one will be able to turn your head once you're there. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Cristina Odone is deputy editor of the New Statesman.</p>",
  "<p>John is separated from his wife and is thinking about living on a boat. He writes:</p> <p>'It all started from a conversation in a pub. When my wife and I separated two years ago, we decided not to divorce as she would lose all rights to the Teachers' widow's pension. Instead we agreed that I should retain my teacher's pension while she kept the marital home, mortgage paid. This is still in our joint names but I am planning to sign it over to her. </p> <p>Currently I am renting a house for \u00a3325 a month. I am fortunate because I pay a relatively low rent for a decent two-bedroom Victorian house. But the cheap rent has put me in a comfort zone. I am reluctant to take on a mortgage and, because of my salary and age, 51, I could not afford to buy anything comparable to this as a mortgage would have to be paid off when I retire in 10 years' time. </p> <p>I would be in effect be a first-time buyer but I feel almost excluded from the housing market. </p> <p>Then I got talking to friends in a pub who have lived on a narrow boat for seven years. They have now bought a house and want to sell the boat for about \u00a335,000. I could make it my home with the bonus that holidays would be wherever I wanted to go. </p> <p>I am not specially tidy but I am prepared to make changes to fit life on the water. I have relations who own boats and have asked them to give me the negative side. I could raise \u00a36,000 to \u00a37,000 but I would have to borrow the balance of about \u00a328,000. </p> <p>I already owe \u00a312,500 on a five-year fixed-term loan with Tesco and have about \u00a3400 debt on my credit card. I have little money to play with but I hope to be debt free and have more disposable income in four to five years' time when our youngest child finishes university. </p> <p>I have \u00a3700 in a cash Isa and an endowment policy with Winterthur which costs only \u00a312 a month but has produced zero bonuses for at least two years. The current surrender value is around \u00a36,000. I also have a tax-free plan with Teachers Assurance which costs \u00a325 a month and is worth \u00a31,000 if I cash it in. My pension will provide me with a half salary and a lump sum on retirement. </p> <p>Should I take on a mortgage, cash in policies and reduce debts or consider my other options? My natural tendency is to be complacent and drift.'</p> <p><strong>Forget the romance and think ahead</strong></p> <p>You need to be sure that your preference for taking the easy route does not lead to problems later on. While you are both satisfied with the financial arrangement at the moment, either of your circumstances, personal and financial, could change. </p> <p>Joanne Cox, an independent adviser with Co-operative Bank Financial Advisers, warns: 'While John may feel he is doing the best for his family by handing over the family home and even having his name removed from the deeds, he should take advice from a solicitor to establish just what his options and responsibilities are.</p> <p>'If, later on, his estranged wife became unable to cope financially, John may find himself without a home yet providing maintenance, either on a voluntary or compulsory basis. It will be much more difficult for him to renegotiate terms if his name is not on the deeds of the house.'</p> <p>You do not have to take a solicitor's advice but at least you will be better informed about deciding what to do: 'Private arrangements, however well intentioned, can sometimes cause more tension and discord over time than formal arrangements which ensure everyone knows where they stand,' says Cox.</p> <p>At 51, living on a boat might sound practical and even romantic. But you must think ahead. Will you still be able to cope with cramped conditions when you are 61 or 71? Finding accommodation on land then will be even more difficult, says Cox: 'If John feels he is almost excluded from the property market now, he certainly will be in 10 years' time.'</p> <p>To help with the cost of a mortgage, you could buy a house for yourself large enough to take in a lodger and charge up to \u00a381.73 a week, \u00a34,250 a year, without paying tax under the Government Rent-a-Room scheme. This would help pay the mortgage.</p> <p>Or, if you prefer not to share, you could stay put and buy a property to rent out. As house prices have stopped rising, you need to choose carefully. For a buy-to-let mortgage, you'll probably need a 20 per cent deposit but can borrow 100 per cent for a traditional home loan.</p> <p>Cox advises: 'If John needed a deposit, he could consider surrendering his savings plans, but understand that he would also lose the life insurance cover. Before doing this he should take advice and take into account the remaining term of the policies, premiums paid to date, penalties and projected maturity.'</p> <p>She adds: 'Some lenders might take the existing prop erty into consideration as security if John's name remained on the deeds and his estranged wife agreed.'</p> <p>Owning a boat is different from owning a house as it depreciates in value, yet still has expensive outgoings with insurance, mooring fees and regular expensive maintenance. You will probably pay council tax, depending on the local authority. </p> <p>But if, despite learning the downsides, you really do want to become a 'liveaboard', thoroughly research the subject, starting with the Residential Boat Owners Association (www.rboa.co.uk) and National Association of Boat Owners (www.nabo.org.uk).</p> <p>Cox suggests a trial period: 'Could John rent the boat for a couple of months to see how he likes life on the water once that holiday feeling has worn off?'</p> <p>Even though you would be buying from friends, get the boat surveyed and compare the price, as a cheaper boat might suit you just as well.</p> <p>Few lenders give marine mortgages - loans using a boat as security. One is RoyScot Larch, a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland (www.royscotlarch.co.uk) where you can borrow up to 80 per cent of the cost. The interest rate on \u00a328,000 is 9.9 per cent APR and the loan over 10 years would cost \u00a3362 a month.</p> <p>At Barclays Marine Finance (www.barclays.co.uk) you can borrow 90 per cent secured on the boat at 8.3 per cent APR. You can increase repayments, without penalty, when you have more money to spare.</p> <p>Both these are more expensive than a cheap unsecured personal loan, which at Tesco costs 6.5 per cent APR although the maximum you can borrow is \u00a325,000. Over 10 years, that costs \u00a3282 a month.</p> <p>While you are thinking, keep reducing your credit card bill and put any money you can spare in the cash Isa.</p> <p><strong>John's to-do list</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Check with a solicitor the financial agreement with your wife. </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Investigate the costs of owning a boat.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Consider a buy-to-let.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Continue reducing your credit card debt.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Keep saving in a cash Isa.</p> <p><strong>Let us help you</strong></p> <p>Do you need some financial coaching?

  "<p>The Financial Services Authority is to probe the planned takeover of Abbey National by Santander, Spain's largest bank, amid concern about standards of corporate governance at the Madrid-based institution. FSA spokesman Joseph Eyre said an investigation would seek answers to two main questions: 'First, is the purchaser fit and proper, and second, is the acquisition in the interests of consumers?' </p> <p>He added that an inquiry was standard procedure under new powers vested with the regulator by Parliament in 2000 and would be triggered by a 'change of control' at any financial institution that sells investment products to the public. The FSA will shortly be given additional powers to regulate the entire UK mortgage market. </p> <p>But the probe has taken on greater significance following a demand last week by Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, that the FSA look at corporate governance issues at Santander, where Emilio Botin is chairman. Four members of Botin's family sit on the board and speak for 2.8 per cent of the shares, sparking charges of nepotism. Cable also cited 'abnormally high' bonuses, pensions and pay-offs at the bank. He said: 'We need to know if there is enough external scrutiny and sufficiently robust arrangements for managing risk.' </p> <p>Santander's offer document reveals that the bank's chief executive, Alfredo Saenz, has built up a pension pot worth \u00a335 million, nearly three times more than the \u00a313.9m that has been paid into the pension of Lord Browne, the head of BP. </p> <p>Although Deminor, a Span ish corporate governance agency, gave Santander a clean bill of health in April, it raised several issues. </p> <p>When considering the company's pension arrangements, Deminor states: 'Some amounts guaranteed to individuals seem rather high.' Elsewhere, the report says that stock option plans 'cannot be considered as best practice' due to insufficient performance criteria. </p> <p>Deminor also says 'the absence of any succession plan for both the chairman and the CEO may imply a risk'.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Gartmore and Newton Investment Management</strong></p> <p>Gartmore is the winner in this year's investment trust group category, an award that seeks to recognise consistent performance. </p> <p>On the basis of figures provided by Fundamental Data for a three-year period to the end of June 2004, Gartmore's portfolio of trusts came top when percentile rankings of investment trusts in 15 different sectors were compared. </p> <p>However, according to Ian Overgage, head of investment trusts marketing at Gartmore, the group's success 'is largely due to the excellent performance of our Smaller Companies funds'. </p> <p>He goes on: 'The team approach by fund manager Gervais Williams, head of UK Smaller Companies, and his colleagues has been consistently good over the past two to three years. What is particularly pleasing is that we have seen an upturn in retail demand over the past two or three months, when investors have generally been very wary. </p> <p>'The investment team has a proactive meeting programme, fundamental to its success. We also have consistency in management. Gervais Williams, for example, has been at Gartmore for 11 years.' </p> <p>Gartmore was established in 1969 by British &amp; Commonwealth (B&amp;C) to manage part of B&amp;C's money as well as some outside funds, through investment trusts and other investment portfolios. The company was acquired by Banque Indosuez in 1989 and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1993. </p> <p>In 1996 Gartmore was acquired by NatWest Bank and four years later sold to Nationwide Mutual, one of the largest diversified financial and insurance service providers in the US. Last year Gartmore acquired \u00a31 billion of assets under management for Govett Investments. </p> <p>The Gartmore group currently has \u00a341bn under management and has offices in the US, Germany, Jersey, Italy, Sweden, Spain and Japan, as well as in the UK. </p> <p>Gartmore believes three key strengths differentiate it from competitors: industry focus; stable investment and client service personnel; and proven investment processes and risk management. </p> <p>The group has around \u00a31 billion of assets under management. </p> <p>The unit trust award seeks to recognise excellent performance across sectors and over time - one-hit wonders should look elsewhere. </p> <p>To qualify for this award, groups must have a fund in a UK equity-oriented sector, a fixed interest fund, and at least three geographically diversified funds. Funds are assessed according to their performance over the past three years using the Lipper's 'consistent return measurement'. </p> <p>This year's award goes to Newton Investment Management - and it's all down to teamwork, says chief executive Helena Morrissey. </p> <p>'It boils down to our investment process, which has been honed over many years,' she says. 'We work as a team in a self-challenging environment. </p> <p>'The analysts and fund managers are always challenging one another's ideas. This is a rigorous and robust process which generates lots of debate and consistent results.' </p> <p>Newton was formed in 1978 as a joint venture with Scottish insurance broker Reed Stonehouse, but was renamed Newton Investment Management in 1986 when it was acquired by Alexander &amp; Alexander. A management buyout in 1992 was followed by a deal with the Royal Bank Of Scotland in 1994 when Newton acquired the Capital House Group of companies and the bank bought a one-third interest in the company. </p> <p>In 1998 the Mellon Financial Corporation took a majority interest in Newton and took complete control of the group in 2002. Mellon is a global financial services company, with headquarters in Pittsburgh, US. It claims to be one of the world's leading providers of asset management with approximately \u00a3374bn under management. </p> <p>Following the takeover, Newton was restructured to focus on research, fund management and client servicing. Its sole activity is fund management and it manages a variety of funds, including balanced, specialist equity and fixed income. </p> <p>Newton claims to have been one of the pioneers of thematic investing - spotting trends that are influencing, or are likely to influence, economies or stock markets across the globe. </p> <p>Newton currently has \u00a319bn in assets under management.</p>",
  "<p>The response by trade unions to the closure of a car plant in Coventry last week spells trouble for its owner, Jaguar. The unions involved - the Transport &amp; General Workers and Amicus - were at pains to present a united front that belies years of rivalry and tension between rivals with different records on industrial action and different political views. </p> <p>But things have changed, and Jaguar is unlikely to be the only UK company to feel it. </p> <p>Indeed Tony Woodley (TGWU), Derek Simpson (Amicus), and Kevin Curran (GMB) - leaders of the three largest private-sector unions in the country - were keen to point out from the start of last week's Trades Union Congress in Brighton that they are strongest when they act together. Now, with an election on the way, was the time to act 'strong' and win back ground on their key concern - employment rights - where they feel the government has conceded ground to business. </p> <p>The buzzwords of previous conferences, the 'partnership' of the late Nineties, the 'awkward squad' of the early 2000s, were absent. The word of the week was 'confidence'. A senior Transport and General Workers Union official said: 'There is a greater confidence now. It is probably for a combination of reasons: lower unemployment, a greater degree of working together among the big four unions [the fourth is public sector Unison] or the fact we are getting results from negotiations with government.' </p> <p>But the confidence is also indicated by a more openly robust approach to business. Negotiations with the Labour Party at the summer policy forum in Warwick led to a list of 56 commitments over four key campaigning areas for the unions: fairness at work, pensions, public services and manufacturing. </p> <p>They believe Warwick indicates the balance is tilting back from business - where unions feel it has been since the passing of 'fairness at work', which included the minimum wage and union recognition laws, in Labour's first term. </p> <p>The Warwick commitments include four weeks paid holiday for all as well as bank holidays; extension of employment protection to temporary workers; increased protection of strikers' jobs to 12 weeks; greater protection of pension funds and rights for unions to bargain on pensions; and the widening of the Bank of England's remit to include regional and employment information when setting interest rates. </p> <p>Kevin Curran, head of the 630,000-strong GMB general union says: 'These are popular policies with working people. The trade union movement should have the confidence to go out and argue for them. That is what we are doing.' </p> <p>The TUC's moderate leader, Brendan Barber, recognises the significance of what was agreed: 'Warwick gave Labour and the unions a chance to work together on a programme for the workplace for a third term, which has been missing from the second one.' </p> <p>Some of this has been accepted by business. However the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, Digby Jones, believes there is a scaly underbelly to the unions. He points, for example, to the T&amp;G's motion on employment rights which includes: 'Ensuring the right to take industrial action in accordance with ILO [International Labour Organisation] Conventions.' This means secondary action and flying pickets, says Jones. </p> <p>The CBI is resistant to extending protection for temporary workers, and to diluting or abolishing the opt-out to the EU working time directive that allows employers to ask staff to agree to work more than 48 hours a week. </p> <p>Unions claim companies are often divided into separate units to fragment workforces and thwart attempts by unions to gain recognition. This means that even with recognition, workers in one part of a company cannot always take action in support of those in another. </p> <p>Curran says: 'Digby Jones accuses us of being dinosaurs or wanting to go back to the 1970s. Well, what he is proposing in the name of \"flexible working\" is going back to the 19th century.' </p> <p>Amicus, the engineering and professional union, last week attacked the CBI. Its general secretary Derek Simpson said: 'The CBI wants all the advantages a European free market can offer without signing up to any of the social or employment legislation that would give UK workers more job protection, greater pension rights and achieve a better work life balance. It is a myth that a flexible labour market brings more jobs.' </p> <p>As for the T&amp;G, a senior official said: 'If the government is convinced about our arguments, I can't see that the CBI is a problem.' </p> <p>However, with confidence has come increased friction. Barber has warned about strikes over the dilution of workplace pensions, while Amicus and Community, the steel and textile union, has carried through the threat. The T&amp;G points to high profile industrial action. 'Anecdotally you can see industrial action at British Airways, a very unusual and long strike involving bus staff in Sheffield, stall handlers on race courses, Associated British Ports... it goes on.' </p> <p>The fact is the leaders, and their members, believe that their tougher stance is getting results. And so the buzzword of two or three years ago - 'partnership' - is now rarely heard. The partnership deals that were signed between unions such as Amicus's predecessor, the AEEU, and the T&amp;G itself, were often criticised by more 'militant' leaders as signing away workers' rights in return for single-union recognition deals. </p> <p>The T&amp;G says: 'It does not work. The contention was that if unions collaborated in working for the best of the company in raising productivity the trade-off was that jobs would be saved. It does not happen.' </p> <p>As for the agenda for the next election, he says: 'There is a lot we want that has not been agreed. But we have to accept that we are not far from an election, and have to draw the line somewhere.'</p>",
  "<p>Elliott Bernerd, who today is worth upwards of \u00a3160 million, was a teenage car thief. Aged 14, he stole his stepfather's luxury Bentley to rescue his girlfriend in a blizzard. Unfortunately the roads became impassable, Bernerd and the Bentley were stranded and the budding tycoon was forced to confess all to his stepfather. </p> <p>Was this an early sign of the shape of things to come? After all, flamboyance, opportunism which steers pretty close to the wind and the occasional comeuppance define the man who stands shoulder-to-shoulder with John Ritblat and Gerald Ronson as one of Britain's most irascible property deal makers. </p> <p>Hooded eyes, sideways smile and bags of charm - or smarm, depending who you talk to; Bernerd has prowled the corridors of power, influence and money for over 30 years. </p> <p>The 59-year-old property tycoon has amassed a vast personal fortune. His complex network extends from Peter Mandelson and David Mellor, to whom he famously lent a flat while the former Heritage Secretary 'entertained' Antonia de Sanchez, to financier Lord (Jacob) Rothschild, the late Charles Hambro and Lord Young, the former Cable &amp; Wireless chairman. </p> <p>Most usefully, Bernerd owns a contact book of wealthy Middle Eastern investors that's second-to-none. The book has helped him piece together a string of deals that are the envy of the property world. </p> <p>But it is one of his best contacts - a friendship which dates back 40 years - that could prove his nemesis. </p> <p>Bernerd has known the Russian metal trading billionaire Reuben brothers since he was a teenager. Five months ago, the Bombay-born twins helped Bernerd exit the stock market by investing \u00a3135m in a new private property company, Chelsfield. </p> <p>Now the tycoons are at war. The Reubens are unhappy with Bernerd's management style. The schism has prompted two giant Australian firms - Multiplex, currently building Wembley Stadium, and Westfield, the world's second largest shopping mall developer - to submit offers for the company. </p> <p>It seems inevitable that Chelsfield will be sold and ripped from Bernerd's control. A key insider said the company, which has possibly the most lucrative development portfolio in Britain, requires investors who are in it for the long term. 'Unstable shareholders make carrying on almost impossible,' he said pointedly. </p> <p>Whatever happens, Bernerd will be quids in. His 12 per cent stake is worth tens of millions and crucially, much more than when his firm went private in April. But the son of a film industry executive will be furious at being effectively thrown out of his fiefdom. </p> <p>Those close to him said this is not the end. Others are not so sure. Whatever, even his enemies, and he has many, say that the fact that Elliott Bernerd has survived this long is an achievement in itself. </p> <p>Bernerd has endured two life-threatening operations in his fight against mouth cancer. It nearly killed him. </p> <p>Money has bought him extra time. He sought the best cancer doctors in the world, though operations in New York have left him wearing a face mask. Facial reconstruction surgery has been postponed so he can fight for his company, or extract the best price. </p> <p>He is not shy of his own worth. When Chelsfield floated in the mid-90s, most property company bosses were insuring themselves for \u00a32m. Bernerd was covered for \u00a317m. </p> <p>There are many who resent him. One influential investor said: 'I don't trust him. He's not a crook but he says one thing and then changes his mind.' </p> <p>Just four words illustrate why Bern erd is worth it: Merry Hill Shopping Centre. Bernerd paid just \u00a335m for a 90 per cent stake in the West Midlands mall. Chelsfield now owns the lot. It is currently worth close to \u00a32bn. </p> <p>The initial deal was a lesson in mind games and chutzpah. The preferred buyer put about the idea that the site was contaminated. Intelligence revealed to Bernerd that this was a stalling tactic rather than a way of beating down the price. </p> <p>So he persuaded the mall's receivers to let him do an environmental test. This proved the site was largely fine. Meanwhile, he structured a rival deal with a group of Saudi Arabians which paid \u00a3120m in debt and equity. Chelsfield took 25 per cent of the equity for just \u00a3546,000. What's more, Bernerd was paid \u00a36m by the Saudis for an introduction fee. </p> <p>His admirers say he thrives on deals such as this. The windfalls kept coming. With his long-time collaborator Sir Stuart Lipton, and Rothschild, Bernerd bought a site near Heathrow airport for \u00a38m. Five years later, Bernerd and his partners sold what is now the Stockley Park office campus for \u00a3356m. </p> <p>And in 1994 a stake in a Russian telecom company soon found its way into Lord Young's Cable &amp; Wireless, enabling Bernerd to turn $24m into $40m in just a few months. </p> <p>But insiders say dabbling in Russia was not without personal risk. The story persists that heavies once crashed into his Chelsea home brandishing firearms, although he denies it. </p> <p>There have been pitfalls. Bernerd was caught out badly in the Seventies property crash and two decades later his venture into the world of dotcom has bled him of cash. Chelsfield invested huge amounts in so-called internet hotels but its Global Switch subsidiary got badly burnt as sentiment turned. </p> <p>Bernerd was born to wealthy parents who divorced. He left school at 15 and became an estate agent. Because he never formally qualified, he was not debarred from investing in his own deals. By his mid-20s, with his partner and mentor the late Stephen Laurie, he amassed a big property portfolio. </p> <p>The Seventies property bust looked as if it might ruin him but he recovered thanks to an alliance with Lord Sterling of P&amp;O. Bernerd's business was bought out by Roger Seelig while the flamboyant banker was making Morgan Grenfell the most active bank in the mergers and acquisitions market. </p> <p>It was Seelig who involved Bernerd in the Guinness affair. He subsequently found himself a witness for the prosecution, explaining the arrangement under which he had suggested to the sister of a property dealer, 'Black Jack' Dellal, that she buy Guinness shares as part of an operation that landed people, including Gerald Ronson, in jail. </p> <p>A patron of the arts, Bernerd was a controversial chairman of the London Symphony Trust. He threatened to sue former Arts Council chief Lord Palumbo for withholding a grant. He was put in charge of trying to redevelop London's South Bank. The masterplan was overblown, unwieldy and never materialised. </p> <p>Bernerd now stands on the cusp. The portfolio he owns through Chelsfield includes some of London's most prized development opportunities - a shopping centre at London's White City; a vast retail, housing and office development next to Stratford Channel Tunnel rail terminal; and sites in Paddington and Southwark. </p> <p>But with the bids from Multiplex and Westfield, there is a real prospect that Bernerd will fail to pocket the proceeds of realising these projects. </p> <p>What Bernerd has been best at is seizing control of assets against all odds. That skill is now being sorely tested.</p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Elliott Bernerd </p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> 23 May 1945</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Left school at 15</p> <p><strong>Family:</strong> Married twice.
