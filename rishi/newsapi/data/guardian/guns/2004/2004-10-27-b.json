  "The first units of a Black Watch battlegroup are due to arrive today in their new positions south of Baghdad as Tony Blair indicated that more British troops may replace them in the American-controlled zone before the end of the year. <p>In the most controversial deployment of British troops since the invasion of Iraq, the battlegroup is expected to be based near the town of Iskandariya in a volatile mixed Sunni-Shia region in Iraq's so-called \"triangle of death\". </p> <p>They are replacing US marines who are being deployed northwest to reinforce American troops surrounding Falluja, which has been attacked for months by US armour and aircraft with no sign of a military victory. </p> <p>The 850-strong battlegroup will be under overall US control but under the operational command of British officers. The soldiers will operate under British rules of engagement. </p> <p>Mr Blair yesterday repeated to MPs that the Black Watch battalion of around 500 troops will be home by Christmas. However, he indicated, as did the chief of defence staff, General Sir Michael Walker, last week, that other British troops may be needed to replace them. </p> <p>\"We don't believe there will be a further requirement for other troops,\" he told Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, in the Commons. </p> <p>The prime minister continued: \"But I can't commit myself, I can't guarantee that because I obviously don't know the situation that may arise. What I do know is that if there is any contingency ... we are able to meet it\". </p> <p>Mr Blair said he had not been given an assurance, nor had he sought one from Washington, that when the Black Watch was withdrawn they would be replaced by American, rather than British, troops. </p> <p>Critics of the deployment say its timing is political, enabling the Bush administration to say, in the run-up to the US presidential elections, that America is not alone in Iraq in the fight against insurgents, foreign fighters and terrorists. </p> <p>Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, told MPs last week that US forces in Iraq needed the help of an experienced and well-trained British battlegroup. </p> <p>Of the 130,000 American troops in Iraq, fewer than a third had the \"requisite combat capability\", said Mr Hoon. The Pentagon announced on Tuesday that it was sending more troops to Iraq in the run-up to elections there in January. </p> <p>An ICM survey of 1,001 adults for the Guardian, reported in yesterday's newspaper, found that 61% disapproved of the decision to send the Black Watch in support of US operations against 30% who approved. 55% of Labour voters opposed the decision, the survey showed. </p> <p>The British battlegroup will be operating in an important supply route, including strategic bridges, where US convoys have been regularly attacked by insurgents in fatal incidents leading to the deaths of US soldiers and Iraqis. </p> <p>The British \"softly, softly\" approach to try to influence \"hearts and minds\" will face a tough test in an area widely seen as posing a greater threat than the Shia-dominated, British-controlled southern region around Basra. </p> <p>The British military convoy engaged in what the Ministry of Defence has called Operation Bracken moved north west from Basra yesterday in small groups to evade ambushes. They were accompanied by US marines, and Lynx helicopters flew above. </p> <p>The Black Watch battalion is equipped with 50 Warrior armoured troop carriers. They will be supported by a reconnaissance unit from the largely Welsh Queen's Dragoon Guards, with around 100 men and 12 Scimitar armoured fighting vehicles, and a 50-strong Royal Marine light infantry unit from 40 Commando. </p> <p>There will also be support troops including engineers, logisticians, signallers, medics and nurses. </p> <p>The Black Watch commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel James Cowan, said yesterday that the troops had left Basra heading for the north of Hilla, about 60 miles south of Baghdad. That could be a transit base.</p>",
  "The bitter feud between Robert Kilroy-Silk and the UK Independence party came to a head yesterday when the former chatshow host walked out on his European parliament colleagues and denounced them as \"barmy\". <p>To the delight of the Tories, who had feared that Ukip could inflict severe damage in next year's general election, Mr Kilroy-Silk declared he would remain in the party and try to wrest control of the leadership. </p> <p>Insisting he had pre-empted a move to expel him from Ukip's 12-strong parliamentary group, Mr Kilroy-Silk depicted himself as a moderating force and condemned his former colleagues as extremists. </p> <p>\"I am relieved and happy to leave a group which engaged in barmy politics,\" declared the man who embraced Ukip after being thrown out of the BBC for branding Arabs \"limb amputators\". </p> <p>Warming to his theme, Mr Kilroy-Silk rounded on his former colleagues for urging women to clean behind the fridge and tearing up voting papers on the first day of the new European parliament. </p> <p>Mr Kilroy-Silk also claimed he had been appalled by Ukip's decision to join the same political group in the parliament as the League of Polish Families, which was allegedly anti-semitic and racist. </p> <p>With tempers running high, Mr Kilroy-Silk came within a whisker of being ejected from the parliament's huge chamber for repeated interruptions as MEPs debated the new European commission. Martin Schulz, the German leader of the socialist group of MEPs, accused him of \"political hooliganism\". </p> <p>\"These people who claim to represent the citizens of Europe should be ashamed of themselves,\" he said. </p> <p>Graham Watson, Liberal group leader, apologised for British colleagues \"hurling insults from the back of the hall\". He said: \"I'm quite ashamed that Britain is known for its football hooligans and even more so when I see their political representatives here in parliament.\" </p> <p>Mr Kilroy-Silk was also criticised by his former Ukip colleagues for dividing the party. Nigel Farrage, the leader of the party in the European parliament, said: \"I'm obviously very sad about his resignation. Robert is enormously talented and a great communicator but, if Ukip is to succeed, we have to be a unified team.\" </p> <p>Ukip's leader, Roger Knapman, said he regretted Mr Kilroy-Silk's decision. </p> <p>He said it left Mr Kilroy-Silk's leadership ambitions in disarray. </p> <p>He told PA News: \"He did have talents, particularly in the promotion of the party and of himself. But he has caused us a lot of negative coverage. </p> <p>He added: \"If he can't stand the leadership of the party or the leadership of the group I don't see how he can become the leader of the party.\" </p> <p>But Mr Kilroy-Silk insisted he had committed no offence. </p> <p>\"I can't wait until it's all over,\" he said, accusing the leader of treating Ukip as \"his personal plaything\" and failing to observe due process in moves to expel him. </p> <p>\"I used to belong to an adult political party with proper procedures for imposing discipline,\" he said.</p>",
  "The word meteoric fails to do justice to the brief encounter between Robert Kilroy-Silk and the rest of the UK Independence party's European parliamentary group. Nominated in May, elected in June, they took their seats in July, had their first public falling-out in September, and before October is out they have already gone their separate ways. Yesterday's decision by Mr Kilroy-Silk to give up the Ukip whip in Strasbourg marks the end of one of the shortest one-night stands in political history, a summer affair ending in autumn tears, a wham-bam wedding between the glamorous television star and a dowdy fringe party that makes Liza Minnelli's marriages look like rocks of stability. <p>It is sometimes tempting to underestimate Mr Kilroy-Silk. He is so obviously a politician who looks in the mirror every morning and is hugely taken with what he sees. Long used to top billing, he is ill at ease in a party that does not instantly embrace him as its natural leader. But although there are aspects of Mr Kilroy-Silk that call to mind PG Wodehouse's immortal Roderick Spode, there is also a more serious side to him. As he made clear yesterday, Mr Kilroy-Silk knows from his experience as a rather good backbench Labour MP in the 1970s how a grown-up political party should work. And he is not so blinkered that he fails to see why the Ukip barmy army's recent decision to join the same European parliamentary group as the anti-semitic League of Polish Families is both morally unacceptable and politically foolish. </p> <p>Ukip's welcome for their former colleague's departure to sit as an independent may be premature. Mr Kilroy-Silk still hopes to win control of the party from his new position. But the biggest mistake anyone could make about yesterday's news would be to assume that Ukip now no longer matters in the bigger scheme of things. Ukip is a serious factor in modern politics. This week's Guardian-ICM poll showed the party on 4% support nationwide. That may seem a small share of the vote, but it would be enough to affect the general election outcome in dozens of marginal seats.</p>",
  "<p>Rupert Lowe, the Southampton chairman and a member of the Football Association's executive board, last night defended radical proposals to give the professional game control of the England team and the FA Cup after leaked details of the plan earned a rebuke from the FA chairman Geoff Thompson. </p> <p>In a draft letter circulated to FA board and council members in August and leaked to newspapers this week, Lowe proposes that responsibility for the England team, the FA Cup and other revenue-generating aspects for which the FA is responsible be passed to a professional game board dominated by Premiership and Football League representatives. The FA's national game board, representing England's 40,000 amateur clubs, would be left in charge of rules, regulation and administration.</p> <p>Last night Lowe insisted the letter was not a blueprint for a Premier League takeover of the FA, but rather an attempt to stir debate at a crucial time for the governing body.</p> <p>\"I wrote it with only the best interests of the FA at heart,\" he said. \"The Premier League does not need to take over the FA; it already distributes vast amounts of money to English football and is the envy of leagues throughout the world, so the last thing we want is a spat between the most successful league in the world and the national game. We're all in this together and what we should be doing is using the skills and abilities that have built up the best league in the world to help structure an FA in such a way that it makes sense to everybody, generates more money from its competitions - be it cup competitions or team England - but which then gets distributed to the professional and national game.\"</p> <p>Last night Thompson made it clear that Lowe's proposals had not been examined by the board and were unlikely to make it on to the agenda in the near future.</p> <p>In the wake of the Faria Alam furore the FA committed to a structural review, to be conducted by an independent chairman most likely drawn from outside the game. Contributions such as Lowe's will, Thompson said, be a matter for the review chairman to deal with. An appointment is expected at the end of November.</p> <p>\"I would like to make it clear that proposals made by Rupert Lowe concerning a structural review have not been discussed by the FA board,\" Thompson said on the FA website. \"Any blueprints, proposals or recommendations will be referred to the independent chairman.\"</p> <p>Lowe's views are not thought to reflect those of all Premier League chairmen but the fact an influential member of the professional game has proposed sweeping reforms will confirm the worst fears of those opposed to a further erosion of the FA's influence.</p>",
  "<p>Steve McClaren has challenged his players to win the Carling Cup for a successive season and an understrength Middlesbrough duly opened their defence of the trophy in convincing fashion. But it was not overly difficult to look the part against such tentative opposition. </p> <p>Indeed, so complete was Coventry's aversion to tackling that Uriah Rennie must have wondered if he was refereeing a reserve game. \"We didn't put them under enough pressure,\" admitted Coventry's manager Peter Reid. \"We didn't really get into the game.\" </p> <p>The match was barely under way when Stewart Downing stretched Luke Steele to the limit with a shot the Coventry goalkeeper parried into the path of his team-mate Dean Leacock, who cleared. </p> <p>If Reid allowed himself an initial sigh of relief at this apparent stroke of good fortune his mood swiftly changed as hesitation between Leacock and Steele allowed Szilard Nemeth in to prod the ball home from close range. </p> <p>Boro's second must have left Reid similarly underwhelmed. After his defence failed to cut out Colin Cooper's deep cross from the left James Morrison cut in from the right wing and beat Steele to the ball to head into an empty net. </p> <p>Goodness knows how many goals Coventry might have conceded if McClaren had not opted to rest several of his bigger stars for a game he nevertheless insisted Boro were taking \"extremely seriously\". </p> <p>But they were hardly required in the face of such meek opposition, the complete antithesis of a trademark Reid team. One notable effect of Coventry's passivity was the ceding of midfield control to the Brazilian Doriva. </p> <p>It was his through-ball that picked out Danny Graham, Downing's half-time replacement, to register Boro's third. With Coventry unsuccessfully appealing for offside, Graham advanced unchallenged before shooting low, right-footed, into the bottom corner from the edge of the area, leaving Steele as helpless as his colleagues. </p>",
  "Yesterday's vote, in which the Knesset approved Israel's disengagement from the Gaza Strip, is only the start of a long process. The numerous opponents of the disengagement - principally from the right - are lying in ambush, and it is far from certain that the programme will be carried out. The plan is already splitting the state of Israel - politically and socially, religiously and emotionally. And as the time for evacuating the settlements draws near, this split will no doubt continue to deepen. But only if and when the entire process is completed, in about a year's time, will we be able to look back at yesterday's vote and say that it marked a historic turning point in the Israel-Arab conflict. <p>Ariel Sharon is presently waging the most difficult and complicated political battle of his life. He is now proceeding against the rigid ideology that he has always supported, and that has guided his actions for decades. At the beginning of the 1970s, Sharon initiated and encouraged the building of settlements, taking care to plant them just where their presence would block any possibility of an arrangement that would include an Israeli withdrawal and separation from the occupied territories. Over the past three decades it was Sharon who impeded any diplomatic process that might, in his opinion, have led to the evacuation of settlements. </p> <p>Now he must wage an uncompromising battle against a reality that he himself shaped, and against a world-view of which he was among the most important and charismatic creators and symbols. He must also face hundreds of thousands of Israelis - not only settlers - who saw him as their admired leader and guide, many of whom now see him as a traitor. </p> <p>And it makes no difference what Sharon's hidden motives were when he decided to disengage from the Gaza Strip. He almost always has a hidden motive, and there is almost always some kind of \"double-bottomed suitcase\" to his proposals and his moves. He himself admitted recently that he put forth his disengagement plan in order to block \"defeatist\" initiatives, such as the Geneva accords, that sprang up due to the country's diplomatic vacuum and its consequent frustration. </p> <p>Whether his motive is to manipulate or to bring about true change, Sharon is now leading one of the most important processes to take place between Israel and the Palestinians since the 1967 war - a war that Israel did not want, and ended in its occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The evacuation of the Gaza settlements - and an additional four small settlements in the West Bank - represents an awareness and admission on the right's part that Israel cannot continue to rule over the Palestinians by force. Sharon would certainly disagree with this definition, but the fact that the idea of disengagement was raised at all demonstrates acceptance of the notion that some time in the future Israel will be forced to withdraw from the other occupied territories it controls as well. Above all, the majority's acceptance of the disengagement plan means that the nationalistic and religious ideology of the Israeli right - an ideology that has, since the beginning of the 20th century and to this day, rejected the land's division into two states - is a complete failure. </p> <p>Sharon is now acting with great personal and public courage. Unfortunately, however, even while conducting this important and historic revolution, he has not succeeded in freeing himself from the belligerence and short-sightedness that have characterised his entire political career. He is not using the Israeli withdrawal - from the occupied territories and from a rigid ideology - as an opportunity to renew dialogue with the Palestinians and perhaps to move toward a comprehensive arrangement with them. Instead, he is evacuating 7,500 settlers and the Israeli army from the Gaza Strip unilaterally, while totally ignoring the Palestinians. To him, they are not a party to this process. </p> <p>Consequently, it is important to take a realistic view and understand that what is about to happen is neither a peace agreement nor a peace process. Moreover, the Palestinian resistance to the occupation will continue, for most Palestinian lands will remain under Israel's control, and - according to international law - Israel's responsibility. Sharon does not hide his opinion that a withdrawal from Gaza will be to Israel's advantage, enabling it to win the approval of the United States (at least under George Bush) and to \"launder\" and perpetuate Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Some 230,000 settlers now live in the West Bank, which is the heart of the settlement movement and its ideological focus. Moreover, most Israelis have a much stronger emotional, religious and national connection to the West Bank than they have to the Gaza Strip. Thus, by 'sacrificing\" the Gaza settlements, Sharon is making a move, known in chess as a gambit, in order to save his queen - an Israeli presence in the West Bank. </p> <p>And perhaps this also explains the extraordinary vigour of the battle the settlers are now waging against the disengagement from the Gaza Strip. For even if many settlers suspect that the fight for Gaza is already lost, there are some who intend to turn their struggle against the disengagement into a symbol. They are a small but violent and stubborn minority who may have an interest in burning that struggle into the Israeli consciousness as a terrible national shock, even a national trauma, in order to ensure that many years will pass before an Israeli leader will dare to take the risk of evacuating additional settlers from the West Bank. </p> <p>The settlers' struggle is already forceful and vitriolic. It includes threats against Sharon's life, and expresses utter contempt for the rule of law in Israel. Their terminology reveals the intensity of the fear that presently engulfs them. They call the government officials charged with preparing for the evacuation a \"Judenrat' (the Jewish council the Nazis established in the ghettos to make the process of exterminating the Jews more efficient, among other functions), and they term soldiers willing to participate in the evacuation \"Nazis\", no less. Rabbis and rightist public figures call on soldiers to disobey orders and not to participate in the \"expulsion of the Jewish people from its land\". </p> <p>The settlers' language exposes the fact that many of them relate to the state of Israel - and its democratic character - as merely an intermediate stage on the way to fulfilling a \"greater\" national, religious and messianic idea. Israel's silent majority has been shocked to learn the true price of the admiring and forgiving indulgence that it displayed toward the settlers over the years. Only now - and, perhaps, too late - has the average Israeli awak ened to discover that his passive acceptance of the settlers' behaviour toward the Palestinians has helped them become a danger to him personally, as well as to his government, his democracy, and his state. </p> <p>No, we should not ignore the pain of the thousands who are to be evacuated. For them, the disengagement represents a shattered dream, a tragic uprooting from home and homeland. But the state of Israel cannot allow this minority to dictate to it and to prevent it from realising a better future. No one doubts that after yesterday's vote, the settlers will continue to fight the disengagement plan with all their might, and some will not be particular about their means. Despite all this, it is possible that Israel has begun a process that may in the future enable it to end the occupation, and to return to a healthier and more optimistic way of life. <br> <b>Translated by Sara Avitzour</b></p>",
  "Ariel Sharon is no dove. On the ornithological scale that measures readiness for compromise on the enduring issues of peace and territory in the Arab-Israeli dispute, he has always been a hawk - and one with a dangerously sharp beak. But last night, amid extraordinary scenes, a deeply divided Knesset backed his plan to disengage from the Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel since its victory in the 1967 war. Against a background of unrelieved gloom about the prospects for peace, this is a landmark moment for both parties to this intractable conflict. If Greater Israel is shrinking, that is good news. <p>It is a long time since adoring supporters chanted \"Arik King of Israel\" to a rousing biblical tune. Palestinians regard the Likud leader as the most vicious of Israeli prime ministers - fundamentally opposed to Palestinian rights and architect of hardline policies that have brought them untold misery. Mr Sharon entered politics after a career spent in the army and has retained the bulldozing style he displayed as a young officer in the 1950s, through his time crushing PLO resistance in the Gaza of the 1970s, as the defence minister planning the Lebanon war in 1982, as the godfather of many of the settlements dotted right across the occupied Arab territories. </p> <p>Mr Sharon's decision to pull out of Gaza, and more significantly, dismantle its 21 Jewish outposts, is a tactical withdrawal worthy of this old warhorse. The strip's population of 1.4 million Palestinians, crammed into squalid refugee camps and radicalised by the rise of militant Islamist groups, are an unmanageable burden even with the military superiority brought by remote-controlled drones, Apache helicopters and laser-guided missiles against an enemy armed with primitive rockets and suicide bombers. Even if the moral and human cost of staying put is not uppermost in his mind, the Israeli leader has still made a key move. </p> <p>Mr Sharon's intention is to reduce daily confrontations in Gaza while buying time over the West Bank. This is territory, as he put it obliquely but clearly on Monday, that he sees as \"essential to our existence.\" But it is also where most Palestinians live, and without it there cannot be a viable Palestinian state, still - despite George Bush's short-sighted sabotage - the goal of the internationally backed \"road map\" to peace. </p> <p>Yet it is also a manoeuvre of huge strategic significance. An Israeli withdrawal will allow Gazans, helped by a generous world, to salvage something from the long decades of occupation. It also creates an important precedent for dismantling settlements - a taboo for Mr Sharon's furious critics. But there should be no mistake about these outposts, subsidised by the Israeli taxpayer, built on confiscated land with swimming pools and beautifully tended lawns behind the barbed wire and watchtowers that guard them from Palestinian fury. They have no legal or moral justification. It is right that they should go. </p> <p>Observers of the Arab-Israeli conflict often argue that it is only a strong leader of the right, like Mr Sharon, who can make the painful choices needed for peace, as it was General de Gaulle who understood that though the Algerian war could be won militarily, it could not be sustained politically. This can be overstated. Mr Sharon needs the support of the opposition Labour party for his Gaza plan and is haemorrhaging support from his own side. An earlier Likud leader, Menachem Begin, faced extremist wrath by agreeing to dismantle settlements in Sinai in exchange for peace with Egypt in 1979. But that was only done to avoid dealing with the heart of the conflict - the rights of the Palestinians. Leaving the Gaza Strip is a necessary but not sufficient condition to establish peace. Gaza's liberation can be first. It will mean little if it also turns out to be last.</p>",

  "A young mother wept in the witness box yesterday as she described how two policemen subjected her to a horrific rape ordeal when they were supposed to be helping her after an assault. <p>The 23-year-old woman claimed the on-duty officers carried out the attack in her living room in the early hours of September 20, last year, knowing her three children and a male babysitter were asleep upstairs. </p> <p>The two constables had been called to her aid earlier when a man allegedly punched her in the head in a post-pub row in the centre of Godalming, Surrey, and they gave her a lift home. </p> <p>Richard Onslow QC, prosecuting, told Winchester crown court that she did not report the rape at the time because she had been very drunk and feared she would not be believed. Mr Onslow said the story only came to light when the two policemen boasted to colleagues about \"spit roasting\" the mother-of-three - each having her perform oral sex on them while the other penetrated her. </p> <p>The two officers were suspended from Surrey constabulary in January, pending an investigation. Police interviewed the alleged victim and she told them she had been raped. </p> <p>The two defendants were arrested and charged in early February. Semen found on the skirt worn by the woman the night of the alleged rape matched the two policemen's DNA, Mr Onslow said. They eventually admitted in interviews they had sex with her but claimed it was consensual. </p> <p>Mark Witcher, 29, of Drayton, Hampshire, and 30-year-old Andrew Lang, of Whitehill Borden, Hampshire, both deny rape and indecent assault. </p> <p>They also pleaded not guilty to three charges each of wilful misconduct while holding a public office - engaging in sexual activity while on duty, lying to the police control room, and failing to report the original assault allegations. </p> <p>The alleged victim told the court she had been on a night out with friends in Godalming and was on the way home when they got into an argument with three men. </p> <p>One of the men hit her on the head, a friend called the police and the two officers arrived. They offered to drive her around to look for the assailant but abandoned the search and took her home. In the car, they made remarks about the size of her chest. </p> <p>She was, by her own admission, \"really drunk\", having downed about 12 double vodkas with Red Bull, and dizzy from the blow to her head, so the policemen helped her into her house. </p> <p>When she saw one of them on her sofa, with his trousers down, she tried to flee the room but her way was blocked by the other officer. </p> <p>The alleged victim broke down as she told the jury of nine men and three women how the policemen \"spun her round like a rag doll\", as they forced themselves on her. </p> <p>\"They were saying girls like me deserved it, saying I was dirty, and they knew I fucking liked it,\" sobbed the witness. \"I just kept saying 'Get the fuck off me, get off.'\" </p> <p>She said she did not scream louder because she was afraid of waking the children. \"I didn't want the children to come downstairs and I didn't want them to see anything bad happening to their mum.\" </p> <p>She said one officer broke off briefly to answer his police radio, telling the caller he was just leaving the woman's home, before continuing to rape her. When they finished, one of them thanked her before they drove off laughing. </p> <p>She said she scrubbed herself in the bath before collapsing on her bed in tears. She staunchly rejected suggestions by Antony Chinn QC, for Mr Witcher, that she had initiated sex with the defendants. </p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "The language hasn't changed. To his critics, Ariel Sharon is still a brutal criminal, indifferent to suffering as he bulldozes through his security strategy. To his backers he is a visionary, prepared to take bold steps to protect Israel. <p>But those who historically supported or opposed Mr Sharon through his decades as Israel's most controversial warrior and political leader have swapped places. </p> <p>The prime minister's former allies among the settlers and the land-grabbing right are against him now for the same reason his peacenik opponents of many years rally to his support. </p> <p>They all believe that yesterday's vote in the Israeli parliament backing the removal of Jewish settlers from the Gaza strip is a historic step that will inevitably lead to the unravelling of his life's work at the vanguard of expanding Israel's colonies and borders. </p> <p>With it, the prime minister may also be realigning Israeli politics by turning his back on the once powerful religious and far-right factions in parliament to emerge as the champion of the centre. </p> <p>Some of his former Israeli critics now go so far as to compare him to Israel's visionary first prime minister, David Ben Gurion. </p> <p>Shimon Peres, the leader of the Labour opposition, believes that the prime minister's \"unilateral disengagement plan\" has set in chain a process that it will be difficult to reverse. \"Once it starts, it will continue. It's the beginning of a journey to a permanent solution with the Palestinians,\" he said. \"Sharon cannot stop it even if he wanted to.\" </p> <p>Mr Sharon has laid out only the beginning of the process - the removal of about 8,000 settlers from the Gaza strip and a small part of the West Bank - but not how he imagines it will end beyond oblique references to creating a Palestinian state and holding on to the major West Bank settlements. </p> <p>The Palestinians fear that the blueprint is the prime minister's earlier vision of an emasculated Arab state on the 42% of the occupied territories placed under Palestinian administration by the Oslo accords and spotted between the sprawling Jewish settlement blocs that divide up the West Bank. </p> <p>The result would be a homeland without control of its airspace, water resources, borders or foreign policy. </p> <p>Cut off by the vast steel and concrete \"security\" fence and wall under construction through the West Bank, it would amount in many people's eyes to little more than a bantustan reminiscent of apartheid South Africa. </p> <p>The Palestinians are keenly aware that while Mr Sharon talks of disengagement, his government is still expanding the major West Bank settlements. </p> <p>\"It's clear that Sharon is using the withdrawal from Gaza to consolidate the occupation of the West Bank,\" said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian cabinet minister. \"There is no reason to see this as a step toward the creation of a viable Palestinian state.\" </p> <p>But some of Mr Sharon's harshest critics say that he has set in motion a process that will force Israel to give up most of the occupied territories. </p> <p>\"No matter what he says about his intentions - he wants to keep the West Bank and all that - basically this move is unleashing a new political dynamic,\" said Yaron Ezrahi, a political analyst with the Israel Democracy Institute. </p> <p>\"What he does has consequences which are unlikely to be what he says he wants to happen. The public wants it and expects it. The rest of the world wants it.\" </p> <p>\"He has made a turn based on the replacement of ideology by reality and necessity. I think he is walking against his own vision and his own ideology because he began to see the reality of the Israeli situation.\" </p> <p>Nearly two years ago, Mr Sharon decisively won a general election over an opposition Labour party committed to unilaterally withdraw from most of the occupied territories. </p> <p>The then Labour leader, Amram Mitzna, offered to take his party into a national unity government under Mr Sharon if the prime minister would commit himself to dismantling just one small Jewish settlement in the Gaza strip. Mr Sharon refused, saying that to do so would weaken Israel's defences. Less than a year later, he announced the disengagement plan that went much further than Labour was demanding. </p> <p>\"Three years ago nobody would have imagined that this government would dismantle settlements,\" said Mr Peres. \"This prime minister and this government began to realise that we have to answer some very serious questions in the domain of demography, in the domain of geography. In 10 years' time we are going to lose our majority in Israel. So we don't have very much time.\" </p> <p>Mr Sharon said as much in his speech to parliament on Monday when he warned that Israel could not claim to be a democracy and go on governing millions of Palestinians who will soon come to outnumber the Jews in Israel. </p> <p>This month, Mr Sharon's chief aide, Dov Weisglass, said the prime minister was also driven by fears that an alternative peace process might be thrust upon him and a realisation that over time even American support for Israel would erode. </p> <p>Mr Ezrahi said Mr Sharon's attempts to paint Israel as a victim rather than a cause of global terror rebounded. \"He realised that the Israeli Palestinian conflict is of great interest to the west as one of the causes of international terror,\" he said. \"In the beginning, when the terror started, everybody on the right was hoping that would actually globalise support for our war against the Palestinians. What it did eventually is to globalise the intolerability of our occupation to the western world. This pressure can only grow.\" </p> <p>Mr Weisglass also told of concerns that growing dissent within the military, particularly the refusal of elite pilots and commandos to carry out what they characterised as immoral operations in Gaza, was tearing at the tight bond between the Israeli public and its army. </p> <p>Mr Peres believes that no Israeli prime minister can resist such pressures and that whether he likes it or not, Mr Sharon will eventually have to re-embrace the US-led \"road map\" to a Palestinian state. </p> <p>The price for Mr Sharon has been to split his own party, possibly irrevocably. Mr Peres believes the prime minister will have to put together a new coalition of centrist parties to remain in power. </p> <p>\"In a very few days the prime minister will have to decide whether to build a new government or go for elections. We are ready for both,\" he said. </p> <p>But Mr Ezrahi believes that Mr Sharon remains the most powerful figure on the Israeli political stage. </p> <p>\"Despite his difficulties, Sharon radiates the kind of power that few Israeli prime ministers have, only Menachem Begin and David Ben Gurion. He is a tragic figure but he's also going to become a kind of heroic figure who was able to see at a certain moment that his life's enterprise was self destructive to what he was trying to achieve,\" he said.</p>",
  "More than 80 people died after being either suffocated or crushed while in police custody in south Thailand. <p>The deaths followed the breaking up of a demonstration outside a police station in Narathiwat province. </p> <p>\"After we brought people who were arrested into detention, we found that another 78 people were dead,\" said Manit Suthaporn, deputy permanent secretary of the justice ministry. The intial toll had been put at six. Major General Sinchai Nujsathit said the victims might have died from suffocation \"because we had more than 1,300 people packed into the trucks\". </p> <p>The violence boiled over on Monday when more than 1,000 Muslim youths demonstrated. Security forces fired gunshots and used water cannon and teargas to disperse them. </p> <p>Pornthip Rojanasunan, a forensics expert, said autopsies on 78 bodies showed most had died from suffocation. </p> <p>Feelings are running high among the Muslim community in the southern provinces following the imposition of martial law in January. More than 350 have since died in clashes with security forces.</p>",
  "<p>To be at loggerheads with one chairman could be construed as unfortunate, to fall out with two, as Gary Megson did at West Bromwich Albion, suggests he either has a penchant for confrontation or resents figures in authority.</p> <p>But it is not only spats with football club chairmen which have earned the Yorkshireman the reputation of being capable of starting a row in an empty telephone box. Players, club staff and unsupportive media folk also fell foul of Megson during his time at The Hawthorns.</p> <p>Megson, however, denies he is a control freak. \"All I want to do is manage a team to the best of my ability,\" he once said. And there was the root of his problems with successive West Brom chairmen, Paul Thompson and Jeremy Peace.</p> <p>Megson wanted to be in charge of everything to do with football from transfers to training facilities. Thompson, chairman when Megson succeeded Brian Little in March 2000, disagreed; later, Peace followed suit. </p> <p>The chief complaint about Thompson concerned him taking charge of the club's scouting system and transfers, roles Megson believed were the province of the manager at almost every other club.</p> <p>And it was the impasse over those two issues which prompted Thompson to end his 28-month spell in office.</p> <p>Megson had just guided West Brom into the Premiership for the first time so he was speaking from a position of strength, especially so far as supporters were concerned. Moreover, the combination of Megson and the lifelong West Brom fan Peace,who took over as chairman, appeared to be a marriage made in heaven. For a time it was. Relations between them appeared cordial during the first season in the Premiership, but it was an uneasy truce. </p> <p>Peace, mindful that Thompson was still the majority shareholder and could attempt to regain power in the wake of impending relegation, kept his counsel. However, Megson's falling-out with two players - Lee Marshall and Bob Taylor - did not go unnoticed; nor did his comments about the lack of money spent on players.</p> <p>Peace believed the banishing of Marshall to train with the youth team after his transfer from Leicester City and only 10 senior appearances was a waste of money. Megson argued that it was none of Peace's business but, with several other players later to experience similar treatment, a festering sore became an open wound of contention.</p> <p>Megson continued to insist there was nothing sinister in the way he treated his players. \"I do not have personal bust-ups,\" he said. But his comment that one or two players were delighted by West Brom's imminent return to the Nationwide League coincided with Peace buying out Thompson, and shortly afterwards Megson is understood to have received the first of two solicitors' letters warning him about comments made to the media about behind-the-scenes unrest at the club.</p> <p>When relegation was confirmed in May 2003, Peace sought advice from an independent party as to whether he should sack Megson. He had been increasingly concerned about Megson's man-management methods.</p> <p>But, having seen Megson get the team promoted once, Peace ignored his reservations and allowed him to continue as manager. And, although increasingly unhappy with Megson's management style and frequent jibes to the press about the board, he was powerless to act because the team remained in the automatic promotion berths for the entire season.</p> <p>Megson, meanwhile, was frustrated by the club's wage policy and the length of time it took to sign players. Eight months of negotiations were needed before Artim Sakiri was signed; another target, Darren Huckerby, joined Norwich City.</p> <p>The Canaries, like West Brom, were promoted but the cessation of hostilities between manager and chairman ended when another solicitors' letter was fired Megson's way -again for comments made to the media. This time the issue was how much money he would be given to keep the club in the Premiership.</p> <p>Megson was further aggravated by the lack of progress on a new contract. He wanted a lucrative long-term deal as a reward for getting promotion twice; Peace, however, favoured a one-year roll-on deal.</p> <p>Megson's frustration was increased by the delay in getting his squad together; he felt this hindered preparations for the new season. Nwankwo Kanu, for example, arrived on the eve of the new campaign. Megson put the delay down to Peace's refusal to use agents.</p> <p>Megson then demonstrated his increasing disenchantment by vacating his Hawthorns office and making it clear he expected to be sacked. But support for him from West Brom fans plus the decision of Mark Hughes - Peace's preferred replacement - to join Blackburn Rovers kept him in his job. Until yesterday.</p>",
  "Ohio Republicans have challenged the eligibility of 25,000 registered voters, accusing Democrats of fraud. <p>Ohio's county election boards are not equipped to handle the huge caseload. It is likely to balloon further on election day, when the Republicans will dispatch more than 3,000 volunteers to thousands of polling stations around the state to challenge voter credentials. And it might result in the state being a post-election legal battleground. </p> <p>The Ohio Democratic party claims the tactic is designed to create chaos on November 2 and thereby discourage voters, especially those newly registered. The Republicans point to a review of electoral rolls which found 120,000 duplicate names, and an unknown number of ineligible voters, including a murder victim and two suspected terrorists. </p> <p>The Republican party initially issued challenges against 35,000 Ohio names, the Washington Post reported yesterday, but then withdrew some. There remain 25,000 chal lenges, each supposed to get a hearing from a county board, an impossible task. Moreover, each board consists of two Republicans and two Democrats, hugely increasing the likelihood of deadlock, and thousands of unresolved legal battles by next Tuesday. </p> <p>The John Kerry campaign has written to the boards asking them to dismiss the challenges as an \"arbitrary\" attempt to use state law to suppress the vote. </p> <p>Theodore Olsen, a former solicitor general who argued the Bush campaign's case during the 2000 recount, wrote in the New York Times that the sheer presence of thousands of lawyers at the polling stations virtually guaranteed election gridlock across the country.</p>",

Now many horrible things have been said about Michael Martin, and one of them is that he's far too nice to ministers in this government.</p> <p>\"Tony Blair was in reasonably good form; you always end these sessions realising why he's prime minister and the others aren't. He was tackled initially by Michael Howard over the seemingly straightforward question of military cuts. Last week Mr Blair said there wouldn't be cuts in the army, and apparently the chief of the defence staff said there would be, so who was right? And Mr Blair did what I'm afraid he often does. He spends five minutes avoiding saying 'yes, I made a mistake'.</p> <p>\"The PM reminded everyone listening that the Tory shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, is committed to freezing spending on defence - and 'freezing' usually means cuts. There is a difference of opinion on this between Mr Letwin and Nicholas Soames, the mountainous Tory defence spokesman, and Mr Blair hurled that back at Mr Howard. The Tory leader was well pleased: 'I think finally we've got an admission that the number of soldiers is going to fall', he said.</p> <p>\"Then Mr Howard asked when the prime minister was going to sign the EU constitution. 'Hang on a minute,\" replied Mr Blair, \"I want to go back to that defence question first -\" and he tried to get another blow in below the belt on that. That's when the Speaker stepped in and told the prime minister to answer the question - which he did in predictable fashion.</p> <p>\"Mr Howard kept coming back with Eurosceptical quotes from the former chief economic adviser at No 10, Derek Scott: 'Doesn't this all prove that the prime minister is being gutless on the EU?' At that point Mr Blair went for the jugular, saying 'I'll tell you what gutless is, it's not standing up to the United Kingdom Independence party but following them!' There was an enormous roar from the Labour benches - which of course outdid the Tory roars, because there are so many more of them.\"</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS</p> <p>\"'... a true leader would stand up to Ukip,' Mr Blair says pointedly at the Tory leader. A chorus of 'ohs' follows ...\" Matthew Tempest reports on a bare-knuckled <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/commons/story/0,9061,1337064,00.html\">session of PMQs</a>.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</p> <p>The Backbencher asked you why Tony is always asked about his engagements at the start of PMQs. And many readers replied.</p> <p>\"I am ashamed that I know the answer to this question. I am more ashamed that I am bothering to write an e-mail containing it,\" writes a member of an Oxford college whom we shall refer to only as Oscar. \"I am most ashamed that if I win I expect I'll read the prize eagerly from cover to cover.\" Don't be ashamed, Oscar! There's a job for you in the Commons information office.</p> <p>\"Before 1957, there would be a list of questions tabled each day by MPs, and the most relevant departmental minister on the frontbench during the generic question time would rise to answer, and then also to take supplementaries if the Speaker allowed them,\" he explains. \"Since nearly any question on any matter of substance is clearly going to have a departmental minister to answer it, the only way to get the prime minister on his feet to take a question was to table 'To ask the prime minister to list his engagements for x date'.</p> <p>\"Once he'd answered that question, the Speaker would usually then allow supplementaries, which could be on anything, but since they were supplementary questions, the prime minister would be in the answering hot-seat.\" Oscar continues with an explanation of why the practice was maintained despite Tony's PMQs reforms in 1997, but sadly space doesn't permit it. Congratulations, and How Parliament Works - as if you needed it - will be in the post shortly.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION</p> <p>The Backbencher was thinking of descending from the sublime to the ridiculous by giving away Boris Johnson's dreadful Seventy-Two Virgins.

But security turned her away: \"You don't have permission to access <a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com/\">georgewbush.com</a> on this server.\" Was it something she said? No: it turns out that no one outside the US can visit the home of the US president. Thank God, then, for the White House site, which is rightly avoiding all mention of the election.

Clearly bored with early pictures of Barney \"striking a classic pose\", \"casting a shadow\" and \"looking out for cicadas\", the White House web staff have been forced to liven up the daily portrait.</p> <p>On August 3, for example, \"To no avail, Barney attempts to persuade his Secret Service friends to help him dig up the Rose Garden.\" What was his master doing the day before? Why, delivering a speech on reforming the intelligence services. Or take July 7: \"Barney, on a walk in the woods, considers the road not taken.\" George, meanwhile, was preparing a speech on the American Dream. On September 12, the day after the third anniversary of 9/11 and the occasion for a broadcast on 'Three Years of Progress in the War on Terror': \"After talking Faith Based Director Jim Towey into attempting to jump over the White House on a motorcycle, Barney heads up the safety response team.\" By September 26, George is assuring Florida of federal assistance after Hurricane Jeanne. \"A believer in delegating responsibility, Barney ignores specific directions to sweep the White House driveway and tells Willie the Cat to start working.\" Call it coincidence if you like. But a visit to <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/barney/\">Barney's site</a> today confirms that he is waiting impatiently for \"Willie the Cat\" to choose a Halloween pumpkin.

  "The law on murder is to be subject to the most wide-ranging review since the commission that led to the abolition of the death penalty half a century ago, the home secretary, David Blunkett, announced today. <p>Mr Blunkett told MPs that a review was necessary to ensure the law is \"clear, comprehensive and fair\" during a debate on the domestic violence, crime and victims bill this morning.</p> <p>His announcement comes after a Law Commission inquiry concluded two months ago that the law was a \"mess\" and ripe for reform. It recommended a major overhaul, including a rethink of whether murder should always carry a life sentence, because of \"the breadth and depth of discontent\" with the current law.</p> <p>Though the review's terms of reference have yet to be announced, it is known that it will be launched next year and include outside organisations as well as the Home Office. It will be the first wholesale re-examination of the subject since the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment from 1949 to 1953, which led to the Homicide Act in 1957.</p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said that it would examine \"alternatives\" to the mandatory life sentence for murder. But she said insisted that \"the mandatory life sentence and murder principles are important in making clear the specially serious nature of murder\".</p> <p>\"The existence of the mandatory life sentence, coupled with the murder principles, is a clear anchor which establishes this,\" she added.</p> <p>\"However, this does not stop the review from examining and recommending alternative ways to structure offences of homicide, or looking at issues on the construction of the offence such as the intention of the offender, possible defences and partial defences.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Peter Hook, New Order/Joy Division</strong> <br>Peel was the first person to put us on the radio - we sent him a demo and he became a patron to New Order and Joy Division. It was a long time before we actually met him. We were nervous - we had to have a couple of drinks. He was nervous about meeting us, which flabbergasted us. </p> <p>His was the only show that you could be satisfied by and infuriated by within the same hour. He was immune to fashion, he just liked what he liked. That's why people loved him - he took chances, and people these days very rarely take chances. </p> <p><strong> Charles Shaar Murray, music writer</strong> <br>When I was a teenager growing up in Lace Curtain Land during the 1960s, John Peel's Sunday afternoon show was my lifeline. So much of the music that has stayed with me first reached me through Peel's show; his uniqueness lies in his ability to consistently provide this same experience for several generations of kids through several decades of seismic shifts in popular music and culture. </p> <p>Meeting him in the 1970s was a delight: he was just as cool, wise, sardonic and self-deprecating as he seemed on radio, even retaining good humour when he overnighted at my flat and got his feet sprayed by my un-neutered tomcat. </p> <p>Though I rarely listened to his show in the past few years, it was a comfort to know that it, and he, were still there. I cannot imagine anyone else currently on UK music radio being able to match his unique combination of taste and dedication. John Peel will prove irreplaceable. </p> <p> <strong> Andy Kershaw, friend and former Radio 1 colleague</strong> <br>I was hugely influenced by Peel, long before I was broadcasting. It was the breadth of his programme. He introduced me to so many kinds of music - but it was more than that. He juxtaposed them so that one minute you could be listening to punk, the next African, the next country from the 1940s. He was a broadcaster, not a narrowcaster. </p> <p>When I arrived at Radio 1 in 1985, I shared an office with Peel and the producer John Walters. To have been put in the care of two of the great champions of public service broadcasting was a fantastic induction and education. It was hilarious, too - they were like panto dames. Peel at that stage was in his late 40s and I was in my mid-20s, but with our records we were like two kids in a playground, swapping bubblegum cards. </p> <p> <strong> Paul Hartnoll, Orbital</strong> <br>I'm very shocked - we only saw him the other week. The last thing we ever did as Orbital was a live broadcast on his show in July, which was such an honour. He stood right next to the equipment watching us when he didn't have to be in his control room. </p> <p>He was one of the first DJs to play us, certainly on Radio 1, along with Gary Davies of all people. But Peel was always there for us; we did a session for him at Maida Vale in the beginning too. Before I was in a band he gave me so much music. When we were teenagers we'd stay up listening to his show and taping things from it, and I'd go to a friend \"Listen to this, it's really weird\", and it would be something like Oh Superman by Laurie Anderson, which of course went on to become a legendary record. Peel introduced me to Blue Monday by New Order, that bass drum riff and using a drum machine in that fashion. Without hearing that, who knows...? </p> <p>Obviously his favourite band were the Fall, this cantankerous racket, and you'd sort of end up loving them by default because he loved them so much. His influence on my and other generations of musicians was that he opened up your ears to possibilities that you weren't open to before. Peel showed a lot of us not to be so closed-minded. </p> <p>He is irreplaceable, not least because Radio 1 wouldn't give someone like Peel a job now. He survived every trend and every cull, a total one-off, and was more cutting edge at the age of 65 than any DJ there.</p> <p>Nobody else has had the effect he did on me, ever. It feels like losing a musical granddad, or your parents ... without Peel to guide us, we're just going to have to fuck it up for ourselves. </p> <p> <strong> Geoff Travis, Rough Trade</strong> <br> Who else could be mistaken for a Beatle in America (because of his accent) and knew Marc Bolan when he was still practising in his garage? Without John, I don't think Rough Trade would have been able to grow and support the artists we have. Most of our bands did their first radio session with him: the Fall, the Blue Orchids, the Smiths. Think of people like Mark E Smith and Ivor Cutler, who would probably have been consigned to the dustbin of history without him: these are some of the geniuses of our culture. Also, giving Jarvis Cocker a session when he was still a schoolboy changed the course of his life. I'm sure it's the same for thousands of other artists. </p> <p> <strong> Michael Eavis, Glastonbury festival </strong> <br>John came every year to do the TV coverage. He was this young man who first came in 1970, 1971 - he knew what was going on even then. He came from Beatle country, didn't he? Pop music was the first priority for that generation. But he never grew up, he stayed with it, all the way through. In 1983, I was listening to his show and he had the Smiths on. I went to see them in Bristol on the strength of his recommendation, booked them for the festival, and they turned out to be the greatest thing. He had that instinct - but he also invented the notion that popularity in music isn't everything; that sometimes being too populist isn't too smart. </p> <p> <strong> Charlie Gillett, DJ</strong> <br> John was the epitome of the DJ who plays only what he wants to play. He was in America in the 1960s when a whole lot of maverick people were let loose on FM radio to play what they liked, and I think he got infected with that idea. And he's given us a model that is unachievable for anyone else. </p> <p>I don't think everything he played was great and I don't know if he did either. But I don't think that was the point for him. Those of us who want to do what he did only do so because we're convinced we like the right things - I'm very snobby that way. But he wasn't like that at all. </p> <p> <strong> Kevin Shields, My Bloody Valentine</strong> <br> In 1985 we went and stood outside the BBC with the first record we made, 'cos he often said he played records given to him outside. I think we were there for four hours because we hadn't worked out what time he arrived. [When he eventually came out] he said \"Is this any good?\" and we said \"Yes.\" We listened every night until he played it, but we would have anyway. John Peel was our universe for a long time.</p> <p>When I first listened to him, in Ireland - and I've still got loads of tapes of that music - the reception wasn't very good and there was all this phasing, it made music sound much weirder than it was. Did that have an effect on me? That I heard all this great British music through distortion and phase? Very possibly.</p> <p>I was listening to him when I was 15, and I'm 41 now. You know, you have periods when you don't listen to the radio, but it's one of the few things in my life that I've come back to. He was also the first person to play African music in a non-anthropological kind if way, if you know what I mean. Just because they were great records, and you didn't have to hear it on BBC2. That meant a lot. He's the only one with real integrity who's been involved with the music media. </p> <p> <strong> Lauren Laverne, DJ</strong> <br> A lot of people - me included - feel like we've lost our surrogate dad. John was the first person to play one of my band's records when I was 16; because of him I got a record deal, and my first really serious TV job was presenting Glastonbury alongside him and Jo Whiley. Now I'm a DJ on XFM - a whole radio station built around John's kind of show. I feel stupid for being as in debt as I am. </p> <p> <strong> Paul Savage, Delgados; co-founder Chemikal Underground records</strong> <br>You can't underestimate the power of hearing your song being played by John Peel. He supported just about everything our label put out, even when no one else was interested. My mum doesn't even like this music - but having it played on Radio 1 validates it. Getting played on his show is what keeps indie labels going, and I don't know where that is going to come from now. No one else could have taste that catholic without being fake. </p> <p> <strong> Colin Newman, Wire</strong> <br> We once did a Peel session and instead of the usual four songs of three minutes we did a 12-minute song, which was the antithesis of everything the Peel show was about: short, punky, unpretentious. A rumour reached us that he wasn't pleased - but fair play to him, he played it twice. I would like to think he thought, \"What a bunch of chancers\" and had a good laugh. He was always incredibly personable, just like some bloke you'd meet down the road. </p> <p> <strong> Gordon Moakes, Bloc Party</strong> <br> I spent 10 or 15 years listening to Peel - everything I love as a music-listener came from him. It was a dream come true for us to get played on his show, let alone to get asked to do a session. We were supposed to be recording that next week. It's possible that we're one of the last bands to benefit from his patronage. It's going to be much more of a struggle for bands to get played on the radio now. </p> <p> <strong>Michael Bradley, Undertones</strong> <br> No one thought that John Peel would ever die - he should have gone on and on. He was here in Derry in 2000 because he was presenting a documentary about the Undertones, and someone said about the \"respect\" he was held in, and he was very uncomfortable with that. He enjoyed what he did, but he never put much of a real value on it. He was very quick to say, \"All I do is play records.\" He never tried to be a star, and that's maybe why he never lost his focus.</p> <p>\"He could be very funny too. On his Radio 4 programme Home Truths recently someone was talking about having a Scandinavian wife, and he commented that there was a time at Radio 1 where he was the only one who didn't have a Scandinavian wife! He was brilliant for one-liners. I still listened to his Radio 1 show: you knew that every hour there would be at least one great record that you would never have heard anywhere else. What was great about him too was that he never followed trends. Not that he missed the obvious ones though - some DJs might have been snobby about playing the White Stripes because they were everywhere, but he didn't care because he loved them. </p> <p>We weren't his favourite band - that was the Fall - but we made his favourite record, Teenage Kicks. Growing up in Derry we were big fans of the show, we'd listen to hear the Clash or the Sex Pistols because no one else would play them. When he then started playing our records we couldn't believe it.</p> <p>He managed to become an institution - although he wouldn't have seen it that way. Radio 1 could never replace him, although there have been so many programmes inspired by him he's done the job in one way. He'll be harder to be replaced in people's hearts because everybody loved him.</p> <p> <strong>Spider Stacy, the Pogues</strong><br> I thought John would receive some special dispensation and not have to die like the rest of us. Like a lot of other bands I think a lot of people heard us for the first time on his show. </p> <p>I only met him once and that was at Dingwalls, just after the Heysel tragedy and of course being a Liverpool fan he was gutted and probably not too focused on what we were saying. But I just wanted to say thanks because he did so much for so many bands. Even so it feels like a friend has died; I imagine millions of people feel the same way. He was still going out and bigging up new bands, some that you'd never want to hear again, but at least you got the chance to hear them. He defined catholic taste, everything equally. In the late 70s you'd hear Ivor Cutler cheek by jowl with Siouxsie and the Banshees, and it was just brilliant. Then he'd play some spaced out dub record or something absoloutely mental from the back of beyond in Scandinavia. </p> <p>I only ever heard him once slagging off a record. This was back in '73 or '74 - he said he felt he had to play the new Yes record, and went on to absolutely destroy it on air, which was, of course, exactly the same sentiments which gave birth to punk.</p> <p> <strong>Will Sergeant, Echo and the Bunnymen</strong><br> He was enormously influential in bringing the Bunnymen to the public. You can't imagine us getting anywhere without having done the early Peel sessions. We treated them as demos too, they were dead important for us in discovering and recording our sound. But he was more than that. He was important as a fan, because everyone listened to him. The first time I heard the Residents was on John Peel, and thought, \"What the hell's this?\" His programme was like a religion, you'd listen to it to hear what was about and what was coming up. Probably every important band of the last 30 years got their first airplay on Peel, and he was still doing it last week. </p> <p>The Bunnymen did innumerable sessions for Peel over the years and we played his birthday party when he was 60. He still played our new records, but he was always one for keeping the programme fresh. He was a bit like a schoolteacher in that he'd help you and send you on your way into the world and then a new batch of pupils would arrive. He got so many demos sent in every week and I do believe he listened to them all. I remember when we did our first Peel session he said \"And here we have the mighty Echo and the Bunnymen\", and we were so chuffed. We all crowded round our trannies. It felt like we meant something.</p> <p> <strong>Sean Booth, Autechre</strong><br> I used to listen to him loads as a kid he had a way of flipping you so you ended up liking things you wouldn't normally have given any attention. He messed with my blinkers so much they fell off after a bit. Without him being around we probably wouldn't have bothered making music at all. Radio 1 was basically a dead zone to us except for occasional jolts, but his show was totally solid end to end what he wanted to play - nothing brought his playlist together other than the fact that he liked it. It's a rare thing these days for anyone at all to rely only on their gut and just feel something. He's responsible for so much ... I can't imagine the world without him.</p> <p> <strong>Joey Burns, Calexico</strong><br> We were fortunate enough to get to play at his house, with his wife Sheila and the family there. We were pretty amazed that anyone would be happy with musicians tramping through the mud and setting up equipment, but they were so comfortable and so courteous. It's strange cos I've got this little BBC postcard of John Peel up here in the kitchen, I've taken it down and I'm gonna make a shrine. We have a get together here in Tucson, Arizona for the Day of the Dead, on November 2. People of all faiths come, and a friend of mine makes a big shrine, and asks people to bring pictures.</p> <p>[Peel] was the link: from the 60s through the 70s and punk into the 80s. That was the beautiful thing about him, that he was so eclectic. He was the shit and the focal point and the direction from which everyone took their cue. At the time we met him, he was telling us how wildly he was into Reverend Franklin, Aretha's father. Gospel! Sure! Why not? At the same time, he was asking all these questions about twang guitar and Duane Eddy. I think he secretly loved American music.</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Interviews by Alexis Petridis, David Peschek, Maddy Costa and Dave Simpson.</p>",
  "<p>'Single, twice divorced, bisexual, tattooed blood and sex fetishist, 30, seeks foreign baby for quick adoption. Slavic appearance essential.\" It's an approach that is unlikely to impress the adoption authorities of even the most forward-looking country. Unless, that is, you're Angelina Jolie, star of Tomb Raider, multimillionaire daughter of John Voight, ex-wife of Billy Bob Thornton, and Esquire's \"sexiest woman alive\". If you're Angelina Jolie, incidentals such as inter-country adoption regulations may well be just that: incidental. </p> <p>Jolie was this week reported to be in the process of adopting a baby boy, seven-month-old Gleb, from a Russian orphanage. When she has cleared all the hurdles involved in bringing him home to America, Gleb will join three-year-old Maddox, adopted from Cambodia, in the Jolie household. According to the Sunday Times, the actress was not subjected to the rigours of the normal Russian adoption process, which stipulates that an initial selection is made from a central register using photos and detailed medical records, before a child can be seen. Instead she visited several orphanages, before choosing Gleb from Baby House 13, his spookily named current home. </p> <p>\"She knows from bitter experience that sometimes you have to cut through the red tape to save a child and she is more than willing to do it,\" a unnamed friend of Jolie allegedly told the paper. </p> <p>Jolie, of course, is not the first Hollywood megastar to join the Insta-mum Club, and despite all the sneering, she may well prove to be a great mother to Maddox and Gleb. Joan Crawford may have set the bar low as the horrific \"Mommy Dearest\", but actors such as Calista Flockhart (adoptive single mother to US-born Liam), Sharon Stone (thrice married, recently divorced adoptive mum to toddler Roan) and Michelle Pfeiffer (adopted Claudia Rose shortly before meeting husband David Kelley and giving birth to their son John Henry) all seem to be doing a sensible job of raising their children without the use of wire coathangers. And Jolie does have lots going for her, including bags of cash and a big heart - she is, after all, a UN goodwill ambassador known for her interest in international children's welfare issues. </p> <p>Even if the Russians did slightly warp their rules for Jolie, the process is not exactly ironclad in America, whether it's a domestic baby or a Russian one that you want to adopt. Adoption laws vary from state to state and there is no national register of adoption agencies as there is over here. This makes adoption in the US a haphazard, fraught and highly lucrative business populated by unscrupulous adoption \"facilitators\" and involving atrocious practices such as baby hawking on the internet (including bidding wars and splitting up twins to maximize profits). Jolie might have circumvented the odd Russian regulation, but at least she didn't snap Gleb up on eBay. </p> <p>Of course, that's not to say that Jolie has been as thoroughly vetted as she ought to have been. In Britain, she would have been subject to all kinds of checks that aren't standard in America. Whether or not she would have made it through this process is debatable. According to a spokeman from the Department for Education and Skills, \"Anyone applying to adopt from another country must be assessed and approved in the same way as someone applying to adopt domestically, regardless of their relationship to the child or the country they wish to adopt from. Being single would not have counted against Jolie: according to Barbara Hutchinson, deputy chief executive of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, marital status is no barrier to adoption: \"Year on year there is a slight increase in the number of single women who are choosing to adopt by themselves,\" says Hutchinson. (In the past three years, roughly 360 single British people adopted a child.) Her unstable family background (divorced parents, volatile relationship with estranged father) might not have counted against her, either. But her own two broken marriages might have. Any depression or weird sexual behaviour would certainly have been looked on with suspicion. And the demands of her intense international career may not have been kindly viewed. </p> <p>But frankly, if I had to choose between a childhood in \"Babyhouse 13\" or one in Hollywood, I know which one I'd pick. So good for Angelina with her big heart and deep pockets. And if she decides to adopt a third foreign child, she could always consider Britain. Here, around 2,430 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are being looked after by local authorities and there are around 6,000 children in children's homes. As Hutchinson says: \"BAAF would urge anyone who has the time and space, who can offer stability and permanence to a child waiting to be adopted to make an application.\" </p> <p>Most of those children, of course, aren't cute little babies like Gleb - many are older, and have all sorts of physical and psychological problems. But they still need a home ... or even a Hollywood mansion.</p>",
  "The government has scrapped the idea of combining the proposed national identity card with passports and driving licences, it was confirmed today. <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, has had a change of heart and is instead opting for a free-standing ID card.</p> <p>In a package of \"refinements\" to the controversial proposals, Mr Blunkett also announced that the multi-billion pound scheme will be run by a \"simplified\" single agency attached to the Home Office.</p> <p>The Home Office's official response to the commons' home affairs select committee inquiry into the project said: \"When cost, implementation and risk considerations are assessed together, we now think the option of a free-standing card is more attractive.\"</p> <p>However, there would still be merit in retaining some kind of link between the new ID cards and existing documents, particularly passports, it added.</p> <p>Announcing further details of how the planned system will operate, the Home Office report revealed there will be a \"single, standard verification service\" for government departments to check the identity of cardholders. It would operate as a secure online site, it added.</p> <p>In the government scheme, new cards will include \"biometric\" details of each cardholder, such as their fingerprints, an electronic scan of the dimensions of their face or a scan of the iris of their eye. These unique features will be compared against records held on a central national identity register - theoretically making the cards impossible to forge.</p> <p>The government believes the cards will help combat illegal immigration and working, terrorism and identity fraud. Presenting the card at hospitals, benefits offices and other government agencies will also help exclude people who are not entitled to use state services.</p> <p>The cards - the first national ID card in Britain since wartime cards were scrapped 52 years ago - will be compulsory to have but not to carry.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett said: \"Our plans to bring in a national ID card scheme lie at the heart of our work to ensure that the UK can meet the challenges of a changing world. Biometric ID cards will provide a simple and secure means of verifying identity.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I will now bring forward legislation to bring in a compulsory, national ID card scheme.\"</p> <p>A bill is widely expected to be included in the next Queen's speech.</p> <p>The Home Office had originally planned to phase in ID cards from 2007-2008 as people applied for new or replacement passports. Today's announcement scrapped that plan. Instead, passport applicants from 2007-2008 will get a new biometric passport and a separate ID card.</p> <p>John Denham, Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: \"While there are many detailed issues still to be clarified, and further work needs to be done on costings, the government's response makes it much more likely that this essential scheme will succeed.</p> <p>\"Over the coming months, parliament will want to scrutinise carefully the proposed statutory aims of the scheme, the powers of the commissioner, and the safeguards against misuse of the system.</p> <p>\"If we can get these areas of the bill right, the ID card scheme can be placed on a sound legal footing.\"</p> <p>Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"It appears that when you next renew your passport, you will have no choice but to spend \u00a335 on a stand-alone ID card, on top of a \u00a373 charge for the passport. The cost to the public seems to escalate with every announcement.</p> <p>\"On top of our existing concerns about the card's ability to tackle crime and terrorism, there is increasing evidence to suggest that biometric technology is not as foolproof as the government claims.</p> <p>\"At the very least, ministers should find out if the technology works before committing us to ID cards.\"</p>",

  "<p>Equality is an issue that is still way down the political agenda. It is not as low as it was in Margaret Thatcher's time. She brutally reversed three decades of narrowing inequality by financing tax cuts through cuts to benefits, and openly admitted there was only one form of equality she believed in: equality before the law.</p> <p>Generous extra benefits for poor children and pensioners have made some improvement under Labour. And there are signs it could climb higher. A more encouraging development in the past month was the response from Treasury insiders to a new book on poverty by Ruth Lister, former director of the Child Poverty Action Group (Poverty, published by Polity Press). At a Smith Institute seminar on the book at 11 Downing Street recently, government advisers conceded that reducing inequality had not received enough attention.</p> <p>A second form of inequality was examined in the office of the chancellor yesterday. Organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), the summit brought together a cross-section of society to debate an issue that receives even less scrutiny than the widening gap between the better off and poor. This is the shameful 18% income gap between full-time male and full-time female workers, some 34 years after the 1970 Equal Pay Act. What is worse is comparing part-time women's hourly rate with full-time men's hourly rate, which reveals a 41% gap. Even women who have been to university, within five years of graduation, are earning 15% less than men who have the same qualifications. We are still far from achieving the principle of equal pay for work of equal value.</p> <p>It is not just the inequity that should concern policy makers but its inefficiency. In a powerfully argued six-page pamphlet published to coincide with the summit, the EOC points to the UK's continuing low productivity rates compared with our main competitors. The latest statistics show Germany's output per hour is 19% higher, France's 22% higher, and the US a staggering 39% higher. All this at a time when economic ministers are rightly warning that the only way the UK can compete globally - in a world in which Chinese and Indian wages are less than \u00a320 a week - is through a high-tech highly skilled workforce.</p> <p>The first generation of girls to have beaten boys at all the key exam stages at school and at university are in the process of creating a \"genderquake\" in the professions previously dominated by men. More women than men now win places on the civil service fast-track promotion programme. For the first time, more women last year qualified as barristers than men; women trainee solicitors are outnumbering men by 63% to 37%; female medical students are outnumbering males by 61% to 39%.</p> <p>But in the economy as a whole, there is no such progress being achieved. Only 9% of executive and non-executive directors of the country's top 100 companies are women. There were 32 FTSE 100 companies last year without a female director. And at the bottom, \"occupational segregation\" is either locking large numbers of women into low paid work (caring, catering, cleaning) or locking them out of better paid jobs (plumbing, construction, engineering).</p> <p>Plumbing (only 22 women v 3,100 men on apprenticeship courses), construction (just 1% female employees), or engineering (8%) have deep historic roots driving such segregation. But take a new industry such as IT. At school, girls outperform boys in the relevant GCSE and A-level courses, yet in the workforce men outnumber women by almost five to one. Why? A complex combination of culture, skewed curriculum, poor career advice and failure to challenge occupational stereotyping, which last week's Tomlinson report on reforming education for 14- to 19-year-olds failed to tackle.</p> <p>Sex discrimination still persists despite the 1975 act that outlawed it. There are now more committed ministers, yet they still shy away from the Norwegian option, under which a centre-right government passed a law requiring companies to have 40% female representation on their boards by July next year or face legal action and fines.</p> <p>The most hopeful new driver of more gender equality in Britain is the skills' shortage. Employers have begun to look at \"non-traditional\" workers. British Gas has recruited 100 female engineers. Some construction companies are recruiting women, now that new machinery and health and safety rules have ended the need for brute strength.</p> <p>As the EOC argues, everybody should win: business, from drawing on a larger pool of talent; families, because earnings will be higher and children living in poverty further reduced; and society, by creating a more prosperous country.</p> <p>It will only happen, however, if schools play their part in challenging occupation stereotypes; ministers overhaul current laws and make them simpler and easier to apply; and government and employers maintain the drive for affordable and universal childcare - a new and appropriate frontier for the welfare state in the 21st century.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Malcolm Dean is the Guardian's leader writer on social affairs.</p>",

  "The Norfolk gardener was quite irritated at finding bits of rubbish mixed with the expensive topsoil he had bought: he picked out what he took to be foil from a champagne bottle and unrolled it - to reveal a lost world of Roman magic. <p>Experts from the British Museum and Oxford University have been poring over the scrap of gold foil, no bigger than a postage stamp, which went on display for the first time yesterday, with other archaeological finds reported in the past year. </p> <p>\"It meant nothing to me at first, I wondered if it was a scrap of decoration from a garment or a piece of furniture,\" said Adrian Marsden, the finds officer in Norwich whose desk it first landed on. \"Then I suddenly saw the Greek letter A, and I knew what we must have.\" </p> <p>It is a lamella, a magical charm, one of five found in Britain, and of no more than a few dozen from anywhere in the Roman empire. </p> <p>The scrap of gold was one of 47,000 items reported by the public, most of them worthless but fascinating snippets of history. </p> <p>Treasure - precious metal, coin hoards, and associated objects - must be reported by law, but for other finds there is a voluntary reporting scheme, the Portable Antiquities Scheme, whose annual report was launched yesterday.

  "<p>So Sam West is heading north. In June 2005 he will take over from Michael Grandage as artistic director of Sheffield Theatres. It not only means he will have effective control of three spaces - the Crucible, its studio and the Lyceum - but it is a fascinating sign of the times. West's move proves that running a regional complex is now a covetable position, rather than a form of relegation. </p> <p>Our attitude to regional theatre has been deeply ambivalent since 1945: we have paid lip-service to its importance while starving it of funds and treating London as the theatrical Mecca. I have known many dedicated individuals - such as Peter Cheeseman at Stoke - who have devoted their lives to creating a theatre for their community. Yet, on the whole, the people who run regional theatres have been underpaid, overworked and forced to combine the roles of artist, accountant, ambassador and social missionary. </p> <p>But all that has changed. For a start, funding has made a radical difference: Sheffield Theatres, not untypically, have seen a 40% subsidy increase between 2002 and 2005. As a result, directors can plan ahead, think seasonally and stage large-cast shows. In the Crucible's current Don Carlos there are 14 actors on stage - unthinkable years ago. </p> <p>London, with the National, Royal Court, Donmar and Almeida, will always be a talent-magnet. But the West End, as Dean Acheson once said of postwar Britain, has lost an empire without finding a role. Meanwhile, the regions go from strength to strength: you can find Shakespeare in Bristol, Edinburgh and Hull, Jonson in Manchester, Marlowe in Northampton and new plays opening in Leeds, Sheffield, Salisbury, Coventry and Mold. It's not perfect, but running a regional theatre is no longer a backs-to-the-wall job. </p> <p>West is lucky. He inherits a thriving theatrical complex from Grandage. He is also the beneficiary of the way Jude Kelly raised the profile of regional theatre during her tenure at West Yorkshire Playhouse. But West's appointment is doubly significant as it widens the recruitment-pool for future artistic directors. West is a proven actor and hugely promising director. </p> <p>The words \"actor-manager\" have, in Britain, a faintly pejorative ring. They conjure up an image of Irving at the Lyceum favouring trashy Victorian plays at the expense of Shaw and Ibsen or of Donald Wolfit touring Shakespeare with underwhelming supporting casts. But Gielgud created notable companies in the 1930s and 1940s, Olivier got the National off the ground and, more recently, Ian McKellen, Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance and Barrie Rutter have shown that actors can run the ship without sinking it. </p> <p>In placing a star actor at the helm there are two potential dangers: excess dominance or undue self- effacement. You saw both during Olivier's tenure of the National. Sometimes you wanted him to act more. At other times, as Michael Blakemore observed to me of Long Day's Journey Into Night, Olivier's incandescence couldn't help but turn an ensemble piece into a star vehicle. But West is an entirely different case. He is a lead actor - a particularly fine Hamlet and Richard II - but one brought up in an ensemble tradition. He's also a highly talented director as he proved with his witty, modern-dress Cosi Fan Tutte for the ENO. </p> <p>There are many precedents for the actor who breaks through into directing: Michael Blakemore, Michael Grandage, Gregory Doran and Di Trevis have all done so with conspicuous success. But, unlike them, West is not forsaking acting. He also represents a new generation of well-schooled actors who combine talent and intellect with an awareness of the greater theatrical good. Simon Russell Beale, an associate of both the National and the Almeida, is clearly another whom one longs to see take the plunge and turn his hand to direction. But my suspicion is that there are many more out there. West's appointment signals the emergence of a whole new breed of actor-directors capable of leading theatres visibly, but not vaingloriously, from centre-stage as well as the front office.</p>",
  "There's no question that if France was voting for the next US president, John Kerry would be victorious. The Bush administration era has been catastrophic for Franco-American relations, and France is impatient for a new leader with a more multilateral approach to foreign affairs. <p>The French distaste for the Bush administration is evident in all the polls. A recent survey showed that Kerry would win as much as 82% of the French vote, while George Bush would secure a mere 16%. Around 70% of French people say that their opinion of America has deteriorated over the past three years, 75% of the population say that they have a poor opinion of Bush, and 77% say that they believe the US-led campaign in Iraq was a mistake.</p> <p>Even a cursory glance at relations between France and America over the past three years explains this thirst for a change. Before the row over Iraq, there was already growing French irritation with the US for its refusal to sign the Kyoto protocol, its decision to withdraw its support for the anti-ballistic missile treaty and its opposition to the international court on war criminals. Then the French opposition to the US-led campaign in Iraq triggered a furious exchange of transatlantic insults. Donald Rumsfeld sneered at the \"old Europe\" of France and Germany, which was quickly dubbed the Axis of Weasel. There was the charge that the French were nothing more than cheese-eating surrender monkeys, then there was the enthusiastic rush to rebrand chips as Freedom fries. </p> <p>President Chirac in turn berated the Americans for opening up \"a Pandora's box which none of us can shut\" in Iraq. </p> <p>Such is the current climate of Francophobia in America, that Kerry has been encouraged by his Democratic campaign team not to flaunt the fact that he speaks fluent French and has relatives in France. And in the last weeks of the campaign, Bush has sought to score new points by hardening his tone still further towards the French. \"The use of troops to defend America must never be subject to a veto by countries like France,\" Bush told supporters in Allentown, Pennslyvania last month. Even the mention of France drew boos from the crowd.</p> <p>Given this background of mutual hostility, the powerful desire across France to see a change of administration is understandable and expectations are unfeasibly high. But as France watches the last stages of the US presidential race with interest, there is an awareness that this \"anyone but Bush\" approach may lead to disappointment. </p> <p>There is no guarantee that Kerry will improve relations with France as much as France would like, and there is uncertainty over whether Kerry's policies are really set to be sufficiently different from those of Bush to justify this level of support. \"If Kerry were to be elected, the honeymoon [of France-American relations] would be short,\" Le Figaro warned this week, citing a long list of issues on which Europe was set to be pitted against America, whoever becomes its next president - Iraq, Iran, China and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Commercial disputes could worsen under Kerry - the Democrats are traditionally more protectionist than the Republicans. The risk of disappointment is very great and analysts warn that France could see old divisions re-emerging very quickly, even if there is a change of president.</p> <p>Guillaume Parmentier, director of the French Centre on the United States told the newspaper that the French hopes of a new friendly era under Kerry were misplaced. \"Europeans believe that it's possible to see a return of a multilateralist America. But since 9/11, it's over. Their America is an America of their own fantasy.\"</p> <p>Kerry has stated his desire to see French and German troops in Iraq, but France has made it equally clear that it is unwilling to provide any support for the campaign. Foreign minister Michel Barnier has ruled out the possibility of any troops \"now or later\".</p> <p>\"If Kerry is elected, he will have to establish his position and prove that he is capable of having better international relations than his predecessor,\" Pascal Boniface, director of the Institut des relations internationales et strat\u00e9giques in Paris, said.</p> <p>If the Democrats win, there is no suggestion that the transatlantic abuse will stop. US newspapers reported that the Democratic Senator Joe Biden, a contender to become Kerry's secretary of state, recently criticised French President Jacques Chirac for having \"an ego as big as this room,\" adding that the French have \"been a pain in the you-know-what.\" </p> <p>But France's media are nevertheless gunning for Kerry. In an editorial published this week, the left-leaning Lib\u00e9ration said that a victory for Bush would mean that America would remain an \"arrogant, imperialistic superpower\" which would worsen the international \"anti-American hatred which has grown spectacularly under his presidency\".</p>",
  "<p>Controversial research on human embryos should be extended, the British Medical Association said today. </p> <p>The organisation said there were \"very strong grounds\" for the move, which could help cure life-threatening diseases. </p> <p>However, it said, where possible, adult, rather than embryonic, stem cells should be used. </p> <p>The call came in evidence to the House of Commons science and technology committee, which is looking into human reproductive technology. </p> <p>In a written submission, the BMA said: \"Given the BMA's long-standing support for embryo research, the BMA believes that there were very strong grounds for extending the areas of research that should be permitted to offer the greatest hope to people who suffer from life-threatening and very debilitating conditions.\" </p> <p>The BMA said because of the \"special status\" given to human embryos, adult stem cells were preferable. However, research suggested there were limitations to the type of tissues that could be taken from adult cells. </p> <p>Until there was clear evidence of the safety and efficacy of the use of adult stem cells, the BMA said research using both adult and embryonic stem cells should carry on in parallel. </p> <p>Giving evidence to the committee, the BMA's director of professional activities, Vivienne Nathanson, said concerns over embryo research were due in part to public misunderstanding and fear over future scientific developments. </p> <p>\"One of the problems is that some of the concerns are about misunderstanding, but also concerns about what can happen in the future,\" she said. </p> <p>The BMA called for a review of legislation on human fertilisation and embryology. </p> <p>It said the regulatory system had worked effectively so far and enabled the UK to become a world leader in reproductive technology. </p> <p>But it said there had been numerous developments since the law came into force 14 years ago. </p> <p>\"The time has now come to review the legislation, to update it and to gain formal backing, both from parliament and the public,\" it said. </p> <p>Major changes were unnecessary, but some small amendments \"could be helpful\".</p>",
  "<p>Australia are closing on their first Test series victory in India since 1969 after ripping through the home side's much-vaunted top-order batting to take control of the crucial third Test in Nagpur. </p> <p>Leading 1-0 after two of the four Tests, a victory here would secure Australia a rare series triumph on the sub-continent - and at the close of play on the second day they were looking odds-on to achieve that. </p> <p>Having extended their first-innings total to 398 all out in the morning session, Australia then reduced India to 146 for five by stumps. </p> <p>Not one of India's top five batsmen was able to make a decent contribution, and it was left to Mohammad Kaif - playing in only his sixth Test match - to take the fight back to the Australians in the closing overs. </p> <p>Kaif ended the day unbeaten on 47, having shared an unbroken 43-run stand with wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel. </p> <p>Before that, though, it was all Australia. Glenn McGrath, playing in his 100th Test match, and Jason Gillespie took two wickets each - and there was one too for Shane Warne as India stuttered to 105 for five. </p> <p>Virender Sehwag was the first to fall when, having raced to 22 after striking four boundaries off Gillespie's first over, he edged a McGrath delivery behind to give wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist his 250th Test dismissal. </p> <p>That left India on 31 for one, and three runs later Aakash Chopra followed his opening partner back to the pavilion when he edged Gillespie to Warne at slip. </p> <p>Even India talisman Sachin Tendulkar was unable to spark the home side. Back in the team after a lengthy injury absence, he could contribute only eight before he was trapped lbw by Gillespie. </p> <p>When Warne sent back VVS Laxman, caught at backward point by Michael Clarke, India were in all sorts of trouble at 75 for four.</p> <p>Rahul Dravid, rated as the world's number one batsman, is usually the perfect man for a crisis - but even he could not halt the Australian onslaught. Captain in place of the injured Sourav Ganguly, Dravid made just 21 before he became McGrath's second victim - edging the ball into the slips where Warne again snapped up the catch. </p> <p>Earlier, India had quickly polished off the Australian tail. Resuming on 362 for seven, the tourists lost their last three wickets for 36 runs after India had taken the second new ball. </p> <p>Gillespie was the first to go, lbw to Zaheer Khan. Michael Kasprowicz soon followed for a duck, caught behind off Ajit Agarkar, with only one run added to the total. </p> <p>McGrath hit a few lusty blows as Clarke attempted to reach his century - and the pair added 22 valuable runs for the final wicket. </p> <p>But Clarke was denied a second Test ton when he edged Zaheer (four for 95) behind to go for 91 and close the innings.</p>",
  "<p>Proposals to forcibly treat people with mental health problems in the community amount to a form of antisocial behaviour order that would \"significantly breach\" their human rights, according to the Law Society.</p> <p>The warning comes in evidence to be submitted later this week to the parliamentary committee which is scrutinising the government's controversial draft mental health bill.</p> <p>Under the proposed legislation patients living in the community, as well as those detained in hospital, could be subjected to compulsory treatment. </p> <p>The bill would allow mental health staff to impose a condition that the person must not engage in \"specified conduct\", such as not being allowed to go to the pub or socialise with certain people. The patient could be forcibly detained in hospital if they breached this code of conduct. </p> <p>A Law Society spokesman said: \"The introduction of community treatment orders in the mental health bill will create the equivalent of psychiatric antisocial behaviour orders to be imposed against people with mental health problems. </p> <p>\"A person with mental health problems who is living in the community must comply with this or be sectioned to hospital. This would constitute a significant breach of the person's human rights.\" </p> <p>Solicitor Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, a member of the Law Society's mental health and disability committee, said the community orders were an \"utterly monstrous distortion of the notion of care and treatment\".</p> <p>She said: \"It's not medicine; it's social control for people who have not been convicted of any offence.\"</p> <p>Cliff Prior, chief executive of the mental health charity Rethink, said the power to impose a code of conduct on patients could potentially breach the European Convention on Human Rights. </p> <p>He said: \"It does open the possibility of extensive interference in a person's private life. It raises questions about how far does the state want to go in controlling people's lives.\"</p> <p>A Department of Health spokeswoman denied that compulsory community treatment would breach patients' human rights.</p> <p>She said: \"There is no question of setting conditions for compulsion in the community unless there is a good reason to do so. For example, a condition might involve preventing a patient from mixing with people who are known to be drug suppliers when the use of drugs was known to exacerbate the patient's mental health problems. </p> <p>\"The establishment of conditions is part of a regulated process, which will involve authorisation by a tribunal, and is not, therefore, a breach of human rights.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, carers accused the draft bill of fundamentally undermining their rights and ability to protect the rights of loved ones with mental health problems.</p> <p>Vicky Yeates, a senior law lecturer at the University of Glamorgan in Wales, attacked clauses in the bill which will replace the nearest relative as the person who has the power to challenge and veto the forcible treatment of patients with that of a \"nominated person\", chosen by the patient. </p> <p>Ms Yeates, whose daughter has mental health problems, said this new role was \"a pale shadow of the nearest relative\". </p> <p>She said: \"Their rights are too little and their role comes too late in the process. While the nearest relative has the hard right to challenge and veto the detention of a patient the nominated person would only have soft rights to be consulted about the treatment.</p> <p>\"The nominated person would not be appointed until after compulsory treatment has been imposed, which means they would be unable to prevent someone from being detained.\"</p> <p>Ms Yeates added that the draft bill would also give the patient's approved mental health professional discretion to ignore the wishes of the carer if they did not deem them to be suitable or eligible.</p> <p>\"The bill significantly erodes the rights of patients and carers,\" she said. \"It's an example of the state wresting back control from the family. It could leave the patient's rights under-protected.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Contractor is one of the most perfectly conceived plays of the past 50 years. In three acts, it presents 12 characters, each with a private grief; it subtly observes its historical moment; it beautifully delineates its social tensions. In addition, an entire marquee is put up and decorated, an entire floor is laid, and all the tables and chairs for a wedding are placed. That's the first two acts. In the third, the whole lot is evacuated, leaving nothing but the empty stage the play began with. It is the most complex bit of sustained theatrics you could imagine. It makes most physical theatre look like Bill and Ben. What is amazing is that at every moment the construction of the tent complements the emotional focus on the stage. What is completely silly, and beyond the bounds of imagination, is that David Storey wrote it in two days. </p> <p>He spent a further two days writing Home, his 1970 play which captures beautifully our strange English spirit of loss, violence and tenderness, muffled in polite vacancy. Two of Storey's other great works, In Celebration (written in 1969 - the same year as The Contractor) and The Changing Room (1972), were laboured by comparison. He spent five days on each. I asked him recently whether this was always the way. \"I have spent time on a lot of plays, and none of them are any good,\" he replied. \"They end up as being the illustration of a theme or an idea. That's not really worth writing.\" Nor does he spoil the brevity of the experience by any lengthy consideration beforehand. \"I start with the first line and see where it leads me. I don't consider it before, it comes from nowhere. It's purely instinctive. It runs straight on.\" </p> <p>This sounds absurd unless you consider the company he keeps. Alan Ayckbourn tends to spend no more than a week on his plays, although he does let the characters run around in his head for a while beforehand. No\u00ebl Coward, the most naturally gifted writer of the 20th century, felt that any longer than a week was unnecessarily effortful. He began Hay Fever on a Friday evening and finished on a Sunday morning - \"What a profitable weekend that was.\" If you think Hay Fever is a bit of frivolous fluff, then you wouldn't be surprised. If you've had the pleasure of working on the play, you'll know it's a stunning piece of Modernist art and a work of Mozartian complexity. Then two days starts to become a wonder. </p> <p>Shakespeare can't have been a slouch, either. The academic industry would love us to think he spent long months drafting and redrafting his works. Well, he wrote 37 plays in 20 years, on top of the poems, and running a theatre, and acting, and building up his property portfolio, and schlepping between Stratford and London. I'd give each play three weeks. Tops. He sponged up his literary sources, then wrote fast. </p> <p>You might argue that a play written in two days needs a lot of rewriting or revision before it's ready for the stage. Not for David Storey. \"Oh no. Very few revisions. Lindsay [Anderson] and I would chip things out. Then we'd often put them back afterwards.\" His philosophy is a simple one. \"If it doesn't cut it the first time, it doesn't work.\" In this world where we are drowning in workshops and writers' groups, readings and development, those words should be carved above the door of each new writing theatre. </p> <p>At what point did the muse disappear and become replaced by the dramaturg? At some point during the 1970s, a shift seems to have occurred where authority ebbed away from the writer and towards the theatres. The literary management industry has done a power of good for theatre, where it has discovered, nurtured and liberated new voices. One of the great stories of the past 30 years in all the arts is the further enfranchisement of social groups who now feel entitled to create and to have a voice. The Royal Court is the chief saint in this regard with its young writers programme, which has brought a host of talents into our culture who would not otherwise be there. </p> <p>But the same industry has done a power of harm where it has set up shop on the rules and regulations of how to write a play. Tinpot Tynanic tyrants, who couldn't put together an episode of The Bill between them, lay down the law to writers on what makes a good play, and how their work should be reshaped, modified and altered. These people would like us to believe that an aura of inscrutable wisdom surrounds the art of playwriting, which any writer of quality knows is bullshit. There are even theatres that have offered separate playwriting courses, segregated between advanced and beginners. This makes as much sense as trying to teach someone how to have sex. </p> <p>You can't teach playwriting. You can work in the theatre, preferably as an actor. And you can live a rich life - whoring, drinking, hurting, being hurt. They might help you towards a play. Preparing for a scheduled discussion on narrative structure will give you nothing but brainache and an inferiority complex. </p> <p>\"Scripts aren't written, they're rewritten\", goes the cry from all the script gurus - all the literary managers, editors, producers, dramaturgs - not just in theatre but film, too. Why do they say this? Because their jobs depend on it. If scripts were left alone, what would they do? A whole industry has arisen around helping writers. If all the money from that industry were spent on stage and on film, new plays would have casts of 30, and the British film industry would be booming again. </p> <p>What dramaturgs and script editors can't allow is that great writing is often bad writing. Eugene O'Neill is full of endless overblown rhetorical flatulence, but he nails the hardest truths. John Osborne could have had a sex change and still have been unable to write a woman's part. Yet his plays are at every moment ablaze with fire and life. As for Shakespeare, if there is a single worse example of how to write yourself out of a hole than the pirate plot in Hamlet, then I'd love to see it. We don't need to tidy or prune this work. Its fault-lines are tied into the freedom of thought and the originality of insight with which it was created. If we tidy it, we ruin it. </p> <p>Everybody wants creativity to be a considered thing. If it is, it can be reacted to in a considered way, and critics, directors and academics can come to the party as well. But a creative act is not considered: it's instinctual. It is to be responded to, reacted against, not considered. Scripts are not rewritten. They're written. </p> <p>I asked David Storey, with the foolish naivety of the romantic, what it felt like to spend two days in that sort of creative state. The writer with the feather quill and the faraway look was somewhere in my imagination. \"Do I feel great delight? No. It just feels like you're doing something.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Storey's Home is at the York Theatre Royal from tonight. Box office: 01904 623 568. Then touring.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Glossy treatment for Norton?</strong><br> Monkey was delighted to bump into <strong>Graham Norton</strong> at the awards, where we chewed the fat over the presenter's exciting new BBC1 show, Strictly Dance Fever. But the conversation was cruelly cut short when he turned round and realised his new partner was talking to the good people of Hello! magazine. \"Should I be worried about this?\" he wondered. \"Graham Norton talks about love and laughter as he shows us around his beautiful London home....\" can only be a few issues away.</p> <p><strong>The joy of text</strong><br> Spotted: BBC1 controller <strong>Lorraine Heggessey</strong> texting furiously during the course of last night's ceremony. With viewers able to vote for their favourite soap right up until the climax of the awards, was she giving EastEnders and extra special helping hand, Monkey wondered? Not a bit of it. It turns out she was messaging BBC3 boss Stuart Murphy and head of entertainment Jane Lush, presumably to congratulate them on Little Britain, because the Beeb didn't have anything else to celebrate. Heggessey did admit casting a single vote for EastEnders, but there's nothing wrong with that. Monkey would suggest a cursory examination of her mobile phone bill just to make sure, but given the nature of BBC inquiries this would doubtless be a prolonged six-month affair.</p> <p><strong>Keeping your sanity on daytime TV</strong><br> Good news for teatime telly fans - the sofa wars between <strong>Paul O'Grady</strong> and Richard and Judy looks set to continue well into the New Year. The artist formerly better known as Lily Savage, who held court in one of the ITV boxes, is being lined up for a second run of the ITV chatshow early next year. But don't suggest the show should become a year-round fixture. After someone kindly suggested it might be him on stage next year to collect the best daytime TV show award he quipped: \"Lord help us. If I did that I'd end up in a straitjacket.\"</p> <p><strong>Eyes Down, seconds out</strong><br> But a return of O'Grady's BBC1 sitcom Eyes Down looks unlikely. The comic compared the experience of making the show, set in a bingo hall, to \"like being on Tenko\". (Note to younger readers - Tenko was a relentlessly gloomy 1981 drama about European women living in Singapore at the outbreak of war in the Far East and their capture by the Japanese). But it appears the feeling is mutual. When O'Grady stumbled into a BBC box being hosted by Lorraine Heggessey, O'Grady said the atmosphere was \"like opening a fridge door... I felt like the wicked witch at a christening\". Ouch.</p> <p><strong>A little cheeky Little Britain</strong><br> Best acceptance speech of the night: Little Britain's <strong>David Walliams</strong>. In a marketing triumph reminiscent of Dawn Airey's appearance on Question Time four years ago, when she prompted 2 million viewers to switch to the \"adult content\" on Five, Walliams told viewers: \"If you switch over to BBC3 now you will just be able to catch the second episode.\" But it takes a lot to impress Walliams' co-star and co-writer, Matt Lucas. Asked by one of the esteemed members of the press back-stage how he felt now that he had won a Bafta and a National TV Award, he said: \"We're not there yet. We haven't won rear of the year.\" There's always next year, fellas.</p> <p><strong>Murphy's law</strong><br> Talking of which, conspicuous by his absence was <strong>Stuart Murphy</strong>, controller of BBC3 who has been yearning for recognition of his achievements, well, for years. (Don't mention the phrase \"little-watched\" or Paddy Barwise within Murph's ear-shot). You don't turn up and you win an award. Now that's what we call Murphy's law.</p> <p><strong>Get over it, David</strong><br> Or could it be Jason's law? The veteran actor <strong>David Jason</strong> had to leave it to ITV's head of drama Nick Elliott to pick up his most popular actor award because he was shooting a new drama. Monkey hears otherwise though. Apparently, he still hasn't got over showing up to the awards in a previous year anticipating an award but failing to get one. Monkey's mole says he didn't fancy a second year of humiliation. Celebrities. Doncha luv em.</p> <p><strong>What to do with an award</strong><br>Best acceptance speech of the night (runner-up): <strong>Caroline Quentin</strong>, who looked ever so slightly bemused when she received her National Television \"recognition\" award after an exhaustive (and exhausting) retrospective of her career which seemed to last forever. \"I am really going to enjoy this award,\" she said. \"As soon as I work out where to put the battery.\"</p> <p><strong>Sour grapes, anyone?</strong><br> \"Imagine waking up in tomorrow morning and being Simon Cowell all day.\" <strong>Chris Tarrant</strong>, who was only a little over-excited after picking up the umpteenth award for Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, slips the knife gently into his successor as ITV's biggest Saturday night star.</p> <p><strong>Best of British</strong><br> Last night's ceremony was the 10th anniversary of the National Television Awards, and it was also the rowdiest. One of the more memorable heckles accompanied <strong>Gordon Brown</strong>'s tribute to Jonny Wilkinson. The award, said Brown, goes to someone who makes us \"proud of Britain\". Cue scream of \"Jordan!\" from a particularly rowdy box to Monkey's left. Thank you, madam.</p> <p><strong>Sam's the man </strong><br> One of the funniest sights in the National TV Awards press room last night was the normally vicious showbiz hack pack coming over all cute and cuddly when interviewing the best newcomer, 11-year-old Coronation Street actor <strong>Sam Aston</strong>. The youngster proved an old pro at the PR game, answering a question about what he was doing with the \u00a340,000 a year he reportedly earns from the soap by saying he was \"just putting it in a trust\". Asked if he would stay with Corrie \"forever\" he replied: \"I don't know. I hope so.\" On reflection, Aston's idea of what \"forever\" might mean turned out to be \"four or five years\". Aw bless. David Beckham could learn a thing or two from this lad about how to handle the media.</p> <p><strong>Sofa, so good for O'Grady</strong><br> <strong>Paul O'Grady</strong> played a commendably straight bat at last night's awards when he was goaded by hacks seeking to inflame the \"sofa wars\" between his ITV teatime show and Channel 4's Richard &amp; Judy. \"I've got too much respect for them, I'm not going to turn on them. They were good to me - my TV career started on their show [ITV's This Morning].\" OK Paul, so what about taking the mickey out of your Channel 4 rivals on air? \"I've never missed a chance to have a dig. But there's nothing behind it. That's showbiz, it's the nature of the beast. It's all telly hype - nothing to do with me, nothing to do with them.\" Monkey is sure PRs on both sides of the \"sofa wars\", who have absolutely no interest whatsoever in cooking up some none existent spat, will be thrilled to hear you say that, Paul.</p> <p><strong>Dawson's profile takes a kicking</strong><br> What a difference 11 months make. Last November, <strong>Matt Dawson</strong> was celebrating being part of the England team that won the Rugby World Cup on an unforgettable night of sporting drama in Sydney. Cut to last night's National Television Awards, he was introduced by host Trevor McDonald as \"Question of Sport's Matt Dawson\". Has it come to that already? </p> <p><strong>Mystery of the couch potato</strong><br> Wicked whispers: which leading <strong>tabloid gossip columnist</strong> has booked a strategic day off today following a busy night at the National TV Awards? The hack in question was last seen departing the after-show party around 1am, heading off in a taxi for more west end fun and frolics in a group including PR man James Herring. And our hard working journo's reason for her day off? She's having a couch delivered. Not a very showbiz excuse, dahling.</p> <p><strong>Chequebook journalism </strong><br> Even hard-bitten showbiz hacks were shocked to see former News of the World TV correspondent <strong>Sharon Marshall</strong>, now with ITV's This Morning, handing over a \u00a320 note to Corrie's cherubic best newcomer Sam Aston in the press room at last night's National Television Awards bash. The shameless Marshall happily explained that making donations to 11-year-old Chesney's piggy bank was the best way of ensuring that he talked to her at red carpet showbiz events. Talk about an old head on young shoulders - that boy will go far.</p> <p><strong>Outfit for a queen</strong><br> <strong>Shazza Marshall</strong> was looking regal last night in her fur-trimmed basque as she popped up and down like a pogo-stick to ask the stars who paraded into the back-stage press room to \"congratulate Fern and Philip\" on their This Morning award. Proof that Shazza is now up there with the stars was the fact that her costume was borrowed for the night from Rigby and Peller, bra-maker to the Queen. Get her.</p>",
  "Mr. Speaker, Members of Knesset, <p>This is a fateful hour for Israel. We are on threshold of a difficult decision, the likes of which we have seldom faced, the significance of which for the future of our country in this region is consistent with the difficulty, pain and dispute it arouses within us. You know that I do not say these things with a light heart to the representatives of the nation and to the entire nation watching and listening to every word uttered here in the Knesset today. This is a people who has courageously faced, and still faces the burden and terror of the ongoing war, which has continued from generation to generation; in which, as in a relay race, fathers pass the guns to their sons; in which the boundary between the frontline and the home front has long been erased; in which schools and hotels, restaurants and marketplaces, cafes and buses have also become targets for cruel terror and premeditated murder. </p> <p>Today, this nation wants to know what decision this house will make at the end of this stormy discussion. What will we say to them, and what message will we convey to them? For me, this decision is unbearably difficult. During my years as a fighter and commander, as a politician, Member of Knesset, as a minister in Israel's governments and as Prime Minister, I have never faced so difficult a decision. </p> <p>I know the implications and impact of the Knesset's decision on the lives of thousands of Israelis who have lived in the Gaza Strip for many years, who were sent there on behalf of the Governments of Israel, and who built homes there, planted trees and grew flowers, and who gave birth to sons and daughters, who have not known any other home. I am well aware of the fact that I sent them and took part in this enterprise, and many of these people are my personal friends. I am well aware of their pain, rage and despair. However, as much as I understand everything they are going through during these days and everything they will face as a result of the necessary decision to be made in the Knesset today, I also believe in the necessity of taking the step of disengagement in these areas, with all the pain it entails, and I am determined to complete this mission. I am firmly convinced and truly believe that this disengagement will strengthen Israel's hold over territory which is essential to our existence, and will be welcomed and appreciated by those near and far, reduce animosity, break through boycotts and sieges and advance us along the path of peace with the Palestinians and our other neighbors. </p> <p>I am accused of deceiving the people and the voters because I am taking steps which are in total opposition to past things I have said and deeds I have done. This is a false accusation. Both during the elections and as Prime Minister, I have repeatedly and publicly said that I support the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel. I have repeatedly and openly said that I am willing to make painful compromises in order to put an end to this ongoing and malignant conflict between those who struggle over this land, and that I would do my utmost in order to bring peace. </p> <p>And I wish, Mr. Chairman, to say that many years before, in 1988, in a meeting with Prime Minister Yitzchak Shamir and with the Ministers of the Likud, I said there that I believe that if we do not want to be pushed back to the 1967 lines, the territory should be divided. </p> <p>As one who fought in all of Israel's wars, and learned from personal experience that without proper force, we do not have a chance of surviving in this region, which does not show mercy towards the weak, I have also have learned from experience that the sword alone cannot decide this bitter dispute in this land. </p> <p>I have been told that the disengagement will be interpreted as a shameful withdrawal under pressure, and will increase the terror campaign, present Israel as weak, and will show our people as a nation unwilling to fight and to stand up for itself. I reject that statement outright. We have the strength to defend this country, and to strike at the enemy which seeks to destroy us. </p> <p>And there are those who tell me that, in exchange for a genuine signed peace agreement, they too would be willing to make these painful compromises. However, regrettably, we do not have a partner on the other side with whom to conduct genuine dialogue, in order to achieve a peace agreement. Even prime ministers of Israel who declared their willingness to relinquish the maximum territory of our homeland were answered with fire and hostility. Recently, the chairman of the Palestinian Authority declared that \"a million shaheeds will break through to Jerusalem\". In the choice between a responsible and wise action in history, which may lead to painful compromise and a \"holy war\" to destroy Israel, Yasser Arafat chose the latter - the path of blood, fire and shaheeds. He seeks to turn a national conflict which can be terminated through mutual understanding into a religious war between Islam and Jews, and even to spill the blood of Jews who live far away. </p> <p>Israel has many hopes, and faces extreme dangers. The most prominent danger is Iran, which is making every effort to acquire nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and establishing an enormous terror network together with Syria in Lebanon. </p> <p>And I ask you: what are we doing and what are we struggling over in the face of these terrible dangers? Are we not capable of uniting to meet this threat? This is the true question. </p> <p>The Disengagement Plan does not replace negotiations and is not meant to permanently freeze the situation which will be created. It is an essential and necessary step in a situation which currently does not enable genuine negotiations for peace. However, everything remains open for a future agreement, which will hopefully be achieved when this murderous terror ends, and our neighbors will realize that they cannot triumph over us in this land. </p> <p>Mr. Chairman, with your permission, I will read several lines from a famous essay which was published in the midst of the Arab Revolt of 1936 - and we must bear in mind that the Jewish community in Israel numbered less than 400,000. This essay by Moshe Beilinson was published in \"Davar\", as I mentioned, during the murderous Arab Revolt of 1936 (and I quote): \"How much longer? People ask. How much longer? Until the strength of Israel in its land will condemn and defeat in advance any enemy attack; until the most enthusiastic and bold in any enemy camp will know; there are no means to break the strength of Israel in its land, because the necessity of life is with it, and the truth of life is with it, and there is no other way but to accept it. This is the essence of this campaign.\" </p> <p>I am convinced that everything we have done since then confirms these emphatic words. </p> <p>We have no desire to permanently rule over millions of Palestinians, who double their numbers every generation. Israel, which wishes to be an exemplary democracy, will not be able to bear such a reality over time. The Disengagement Plan presents the possibility of opening a gate to a different reality. </p> <p>Today, I wish to address our Arab neighbors. Already in our Declaration of Independence, in the midst of a cruel war, Israel, which was born in blood, extended its hand in peace to those who fought against it and sought to destroy it by force (and I quote): \"We appeal - in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months - to the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions.\" </p> <p>A long time has passed since then. This land and this region have known more wars, and have known all the wars between the wars, terror and the difficult counter-actions undertaken by Israel, with the sole purpose of defending the lives of its citizens. In this ongoing war, many among the civilian population, among the innocent, were killed. And tears met tears. I would like you to know that we did not seek to build our lives in this homeland on your ruins. Many years ago, Zeev Jabotinsky wrote in a poem his vision for partnership and peace among the peoples of this land (and I quote): \"There he will be saturated with plenty and joy, the son of the Arab, the son of Nazareth and my son.\" </p> <p>We were attacked and stood firm, with our backs to the sea. Many fell in the battle, and many lost their homes and fields and orchards, and became refugees. This is the way of war. However, war is not inevitable and predestined. Even today, we regret the loss of innocent lives in your midst. Our way is not one of intentional killing. </p> <p>Forty-eight yeas ago, on the eve of our Independence Day in 1956, against the background of the return of the bodies of ten terrorists who committed crimes in Israel, murderous acts in Israel, and who were delivered in wooden coffins to the Egyptians at a border crossing in the Gaza Strip. On this, the Hebrew poet, Natan Alterman wrote the following: </p> <p>\"Arabia, enemy unknown to you, you will awake when you rise against me, My life serves as witness with my back against the wall and to my history and my G-d, Enemy, the power of whose rage in the face of those who rise to destroy him until the day Will be similar only to the force of his brotherhood in a fraternal covenant between one nation and another.\" </p> <p>This was during the time of the terrorist killings and our retaliatory raids. </p> <p>Members of Knesset, With your permission, I wish to end with a quotation from Prime Minister Menahem Begin, who at the end of December 1977, said on this podium (and I quote): </p> <p>\"Where does this irresponsible language come from, in addition to other things which were said? I once said, during an argument with people from Gush Emunim, that I love them today, and will continue to like them tomorrow. I told them: you are wonderful pioneers, builders of the land, settlers on barren soil, in rain and through winter, through all difficulties. However, you have one weakness - you have developed among yourselves a messianic complex. </p> <p>You must remember that there were days, before you were born or were only small children, when other people risked their lives day and night, worked and toiled, made sacrifices and performed their tasks without a hint of a messianic complex. And I call on you today, my good friends from Gush Emunim, to perform your tasks with no less modesty than your predecessors, on other days and nights. </p> <p>We do not require anyone to supervise the Kashrut of our commitment to the Land of Israel! We have dedicated our lives to the land of Israel and to the struggle for its liberation, and will continue to do so.\" </p> <p>I call on the people of Israel to unite at this decisive hour. We must find a common denominator for some form of \"necessary unity\" which will enable us to cope with these fateful days with understanding, and through our common destiny, and which will allow us to construct a dam against brotherly hatred which pushes many over the edge. We have already paid an unbearably high price for murderous fanaticism. We must find the root which brings us all together, and must carry out our actions with the wisdom and responsibility which allow us to lead our lives here as a mature and experienced nation. I call on you to support me at this decisive time. </p> <p>Thank you.</p>",

  "The grenade was about 60cm tall, and leaned against the wall of the Ukrainian interior ministry. Fortunately for the Kiev police special-forces and opposition activists surrounding it, it was made out of papier-mache and sausages. <p>The device had been planted last Tuesday around the ministry's outside wall by Pora, a group of activists sided with the Ukrainian opposition's presidential candidate, Viktor Yushchenko. It was their response to police raiding their headquarters the weekend before and allegedly finding a grenade planted there.</p> <p>Comprised mainly of volunteers Pora's aim is clear: they will protest against the results of Sunday's presidential elections on Monday, irrespective of what the results are.</p> <p>Vladislav Kaskil, a senior coordinator or Pora, has said, presumably referring to biased campaign coverage by state TV: \"We can already say that these elections have not been democratic.\" He added that the group had 15,000 members, only peaceful intentions, but was set on change. \"We [in Ukraine] have the biggest experience of peaceful protest in all of Europe. This is our only opportunity and Ukrainian citizens will be to blame if we cannot use this chance to bring about democracy.\"</p> <p>As he and Pora's other main activists stood around the grenade talking to TV cameras, two soldiers from the special forces joked with each other and a journalist nearby. It was a worrying sign for a small man in a long dark leather coat, who whispered into a walkie-talkie and did his best to look just like a member of the security services as he watched the protest. The police seemed like they would not take that seriously any order to turn on these protestors - either then or during any protests that follow the election.</p> <p>The security services agent approached the two police and barked: \"What are you doing? This man [the journalist] could be a criminal. And then you would have compromised yourself by talking to him and being filmed doing it. Are you idiots?\"</p> <p>The policemen grinned again, at each other and the journalist. The journalist asked the small man who he was. He replied: \"It is good that neither of us know who the other one is.\" The journalist asked again to get the reply: \"Do you have a problem? Do you have a problem?\"</p> <p>Ukraine's fourth presidential vote this Sunday has been predictably overshadowed by the comparatively paltry shenanigans happening across the Atlantic. In Kiev, protests have already begun and talk of revolution is omnipresent. The president has cancelled his planned trip to Poland to stay at home and firefight, and the mayor of Kiev has also already banned any further opposition protests from the capital.</p> <p>It is the endgame of a surreal battle lasting several months that has only deepened the average Ukrainian's disillusionment with democracy and politicians. After a decade of rule by the authoritarian Leonid Kuchma, voters face a bewildering backdrop as they try to choose his successor.</p> <p>First the opposition candidate, Mr Yushchenko, claimed he had been poisoned and fell ill for weeks. Then Viktor Yanukovich, the pro-Russian and government candidate, claimed opposition activists pelted him at a rally with metal objects, not eggs.</p> <p>Next, the opposition said President Kuchma intended to assassinate his chosen successor so he could declare a state of emergency and stay in power. Then 90 tonnes of posters comparing the opposition candidate to an American mosquito sucking Ukraine's blood dry turned up in a warehouse near the capital, Kiev. A campaign office was blown up. Yesterday, an opposition MP said his car was pelted with firebombs.</p> <p>Russia has set up 41 polling stations inside its own borders for Ukrainian citizens, despite the opposition claiming dual citizens do not have the right to vote. They have protested the move which most accept would make vote falsification a lot easier for Mr Yanukovich's side. President Putin flew in today to give his blessing to Mr Yanukovich, and star in a live question-and-answer session broadcast simultaneously on three nationwide TV channels.</p> <p>Sympathy will doubtless fall on the side of Mr Yushchenko in the coming weeks, even if he leads his supporters in peaceful protests designed to hand him victory in the election. He told The Guardian he wants an \"honest, democratic election that does not reflect the interests of Russia, the EU or US, but of the Ukrainian electorate\". </p> <p>He said: \"If we see a significant falsification, then I will be on the side of the people and we may take mass action. I will be with the people.\"</p> <p>From thousands of miles away, it is possible to see this election unashamedly in terms of black and white. A Washington Post columnist this week roared that Mr Yushchenko would: \"Lead an independent and democratic country toward partnership with the west\", whilst Mr Yanukovich would probably ensure Ukraine \"slides toward authoritarian rule\".</p> <p>Yet try asking Ukrainians how they feel and broader dissatisfaction with each candidate emerges. Alexander, 32, likes \"Yushchenko the person, but Yanukovich's policies\". Grigori Parkhomenko, an engineer, will vote for Yushchenko, not because he is the people's moral champion, but because any change is good for the future.</p> <p>Alina Inayeh, head of the Freedom House organisation in Kiev, said one of the main problems of the election is that it has been portrayed in: \"black and white, as a choice between Russia and the EU, between the future and the past, between being poor and being well-off. In reality, their policies will not be that different from each other.\"</p> <p>One analyst remarked: \"The bandits [of big business] will go to jail immediately under Yushchenko, and a few months later under Yanukovich.\" Granted, the political future for Ukraine that Mr Yushchenko's supporters envisage will be freer than the quasi-Russian slide back into authoritarianism and Soviet control that Mr Yanukovich's Moscow backers may be expecting. </p> <p>Mr Yanukovich, the current prime minister, has become very close to the Kremlin, who are not renown for their visions of transparent, reformist politics. One senior western diplomat said Mr Yanukovich, had \"made a lot of people frightened\". But Mr Yushchenko is perhaps not the white knight his US supporters portray him as: he too has served in the Kuchma government, and has a few rich backers.</p> <p>When it comes to the 1,650 Ukrainian troops in Iraq, which most Ukrainians oppose, the candidates have different rhetoric, yet the same shade of grey as a reply. Mr Yushchenko's promise to withdraw the men is tempered with the pledge not to \"discomfort\" Ukraine's allies - the new Iraqi government and the US. Mr Yanukovich counters that the troops will come home some time after the election, in January.</p> <p>Yet black and white is the chosen language of revolution. Ukraine's political future has lost its ideal focus on which political leader and party is best for its development and been transformed into a hi-calorie battle between two former cold war superpowers - the US and Russia.</p> <p>Moscow fears that if Ukraine - Europe's largest country - faces west, it will lose a large part of its geopolitical influence in eastern Europe. Kremlin hawks seek to create a \"unified economic zone\" between Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan - a privatised Soviet Union of sorts what could wield its economic clout from China to Poland.</p> <p>Washington wants Ukraine to join NATO and be another ally in New Europe, another former dictatorship swept up in the \"march of freedom\".</p> <p>The US government has openly put money into voter education and democracy support. Yet the money has an unspoken consequence, in a country where the state tries to control the electoral process and its media coverage, it boosts the opposition.</p> <p>The US ambassador, John Herbst, was sure to add to the pre-electoral drama when he noted in a speech on October 7th: \"Some observers suggest that this is the most important vote since the referendum on independence. Still other observers speak of the election in Manichean terms as a struggle between good and evil.\"</p> <p>Yet a quick glance at Kiev's high streets can explain where the country is inevitably headed. Where two years ago there were empty Soviet-style shops, today there are chain stores and booming shopping centres.</p> <p>Ukraine used to carry the moniker of one of the former Soviet Union's most impoverished states, yet now its government boasts - and a senior western diplomat can almost vouch for - 14% growth. Economic growth will speed Ukraine towards its European neighbours and eventually foster a society where people expect a government that respects their property rights, and their ability to do business and speak their minds freely, wiping away the cobwebs of the Soviet era. </p> <p>The high-noon showdown that Moscow and Washington have engineered here will perhaps have done little other than set Ukraine up for a brittle and fractious handover of power. There will be protests. There may be blood. There may be a new set of people in power. Yet the difficulties and new extremes that lie ahead for the Ukrainian voter - be that the mass sacking of an old government's bureaucrats or a lurch back towards authoritarian Russia - have simply grown since the former cold war enemies chose to duel over their future.</p> <p>Again, politically indifferent and disillusioned Ukrainians want little to do with their soiled brand of democracy. As Yuri, one taxi driver, said last week: \"Tomorrow, I am taking my wife, kids and our stuff and heading for the dacha until it is all over. The police are behind Yanukovich and the army behind Yushchenko. I don't want to be here to find out what happens next.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lunchtime O'Booze seems to be heading back to the bar: a survey reveals that office workers are once again having their midday snifter. </p> <p>It suggests that a third of those questioned go for a lunchtime drink at least three times a week. Three-quarters of them admitted they had sometimes had a few drinks too many.</p> <p>\"Lunchtime drinking is something we thought we had seen the back of, but it appears the lunchtime drink is here to stay,\" said Mike Huss, a senior consultant with Peninsula, the Manchester-based employment law consultancy which carried out the survey.</p> <p>In the study of 1,300 people, responses suggested men and women were equally likely to drink at lunchtime. Six out of 10 said they would have more than two drinks.</p> <p>\"We were getting information that suggested there was a problem with drinking at lunchtime,\" said Mr Huss. \"The survey came up with figures which quite frankly astonished us.</p> <p>\"Clearly, quite a lot of people are enjoying themselves at lunchtime.\"</p> <p>Peninsula, with 14,500 clients, deals with 6,000 calls for advice a week, just under a third of them concerned with misconduct by employees.</p> <p>The survey aimed to find out how much of that might be connected with office-hours drinking.</p> <p>The findings were confirmed by staff at Bar 38, a busy bar in central Manchester.</p> <p>\"We have a busy lunchtime - it's basically what keeps us going through the week,\" said a spokeswoman. \"It's pre-dominantly suits and office workers.\"</p> <p>She added: \"On Fridays, if it's good weather, they'll sit outside, and might not go back to work.\"</p>",
  "<b>Lords hunting vote</b> <br> The House of Lords voted overwhelmingly to allow registered hunting with hounds. Voting was 322 to 72, majority 250, during the hunting bill's committee stage. The move, in defiance of the government's bill which outlaws hunting, puts the Lords once more on a collision course with MPs. <p>It came after nearly three hours of emotional and at times angry debate. Environment minister Lord Whitty was pressed repeatedly to spell out the government's position on the bill and if it would use the Parliament Act to steamroller a hunting ban into law. </p> <p>He insisted it was up to the Lords to come up \"with a proposition which is likely to engage the majority in the House of Commons. If not it is you who are putting us on course for the potential deadlock and therefore potential use of the Parliament Act.\" </p> <p>But Labour peer Lord Donoughue, who urged peers to back the amendment, said registration for hunts was a \"constructive compromise,\" and the vast bulk of the new bill was identical to the government's previous bill. </p> <p><b>Use of Parliament Act</b><br> Tempers flared on all sides of the Commons over the possible use of the Parliament Act to force through a ban. Ministers faced a barrage of criticism from MPs. the government was repeatedly warned that invoking the Act would be regarded as an abuse of power. </p> <p>The constitutional affairs minister, Christopher Leslie, said ministers still hoped agreement could be reached, but emphasised that ultimately the will of the Commons must prevail. </p> <p>Oliver Heald, for the Tories, had warned that using the act was a \"massive exercise\" of government executive power. \"It's the parliamentary nuclear option and should only be used sparingly,\" he said. </p> <p><b>Parliamentary language</b><br>Visitors to parliament will no longer be referred to as \"strangers\" but instead \"the public\" after MPs voted to drop the term under modernisation moves. The Commons leader, Peter Hain, dubbed it \"an ancient, medieval practice...we should get rid of\". </p> <p>References to \"strangers\" date back to 1575 and times when the public was barred from scrutinising what went on at Westminster, he said. </p> <p>But the shadow Commons leader, Oliver Heald, warned against \"stripping away the charm and magic\" of parliament. \"The suggestion that not calling members of the public strangers will improve the accessibility of parliament to the public is surely misguided,\" he argued. </p> <p>To some Tory shouts of \"shame!\", voting was 242 to 167, majority 75, to drop the term strangers. </p> <p><b>EU asylum policy</b><br>Britain retains the right to \"opt-in or out\" of European immigration and asylum policy, home secretary David Blunkett insisted. Despite giving up Britain's veto on EU asylum policy, Mr Blunkett said the government was pursuing a \"balanced and sensible\" policy. </p> <p>Answering an emergency question, he said he was proud of the agreement hammered out at Monday's meeting of justice and home affairs ministers in Luxembourg. </p> <p>But the shadow home secretary, David Davis, warned it was a matter of constitutional importance for Britain to lose the power of veto over asylum and immigration. He accused the government of deliberately employing \"the politics of confusion\" to disguise the impact of the change, which amounted to a \"surrender\" of Britain's ability to control its own borders. </p> <p><b>Future of Scottish regiments</b><br>The government came under fire from MPs again over plans for a major reorganisation of Scottish regiments. Tory Peter Atkinson said there was \"outrage in Scotland at the treatment of the Black Watch and other Scottish regiments\". Plans are being considered to scrap one of Scotland's six infantry regiments and merge the remaining five into a new Scottish \"super regiment\". </p> <p>The Scottish secretary, Alistair Darling, said he was aware of \"people's understandable concern\" about the reorganisation. \"I'm equally aware that many people attach very great importance to maintaining the historic traditions and identities of the Scottish regiments and I hope that is something that will be taken into account\" by the Army Board and the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon. </p> <p><b>Jaguar production</b><br> Small businesses would be \"largely unaffected\" by controversial proposals to end production of Jaguar cars in Coventry, the government said. Ford has announced that it wants to close the luxury car maker's Browns Lane plant, cutting 1,150 jobs. Local MPs have warned that many other jobs could be affected in the area. But trade minister Jacqui Smith said production would only be moved around 16 miles to Castle Bromwich. </p> <p><b>Climate change</b><br>Tory former chancellor Lord Lawson attacked a \"blood-curdling\" speech by Tony Blair warning about the dangers of climate change. The prime minister called for further investment in new low-carbon technologies to counter the threat. </p> <p>Lord Lawson said: \"The prime minister's blood-curdling remarks about the imminent threat to the people of this country from global warming are probably about as well-founded as his earlier remarks about the imminent threat to them from weapons of mass destruction from Iraq.\" </p> <p><b>Procesed food labelling</b><br> Processed foods should be marked with nutritional labels to prevent people relying on \"guesswork and good luck\", urged Labour's Helen Southworth. She said pre-packaged foods that have been processed in some way should be labelled to give people the fullest information on what they are eating. </p> <p>Nutritional information must be clear, easy to read and \"compare like with like\", she said introducing her prepared foods (provision of information) bill which has no chance of becoming law. </p> <p><b>Plastic bags tax</b><br>There are no plans for a tax on plastic bags despite peers' pleas that it would be good for the planet, the government said. Labour's Lord Dubs said the answer was disappointing. \"Plastic causes enormous death and injury to birds, marine mammals and other forms of wildlife.\" The Irish Republic's tax had reduced plastic bag usage there by 90%. </p> <p>But government spokesman Lord Davies of Oldham said although the tax in Ireland was reducing the usage of certain plastic bags \"the more robust plastic bags, which are outside the tax, are used more extensively. </p> <p><b>Cost of anti-war protests</b><br> Policing anti-war protests at RAF Fairford during the Iraq war cost the taxpayer more than \u00a37m. The total bill for policing the Gloucestershire airbase where US B-52 bombers were stationed last year was \u00a37.7m, Home Office minister Hazel Blears said. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br> The Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, and his ministers face MPs at question time. This is followed at noon by questions to the prime minister. MPs then debate the remaining stages of the domestic violence and victims of crime bill. In the Lords, peers continue debate on the committee stage of the hunting bill.</p>",
  "The government will seek to reassure its parliamentary troops today over its controversial plans to pave the way for an expansion of the casino sector. <p>Culture minister Lord McIntosh will explain the rationale behind the gambling bill at a private meeting of Labour parliamentarians.</p> <p>The bill is primarily concerned with modernising regulation of the gambling industry, but has sparked widespread concerns because it would also ease the path for a new generation of \"super casinos\".</p> <p>Lord McIntosh will be addressing the Labour party's culture departmental committee.</p> <p>Its vice-chairman, Lord Dubs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I expect that at the meeting the minister will explain to Labour members of parliament why the government is introducing gambling legislation, why gambling needs to be more tightly controlled and also why the government wants to allow there to be a number of casinos.</p> <p>\"I believe the government will indicate that it is taking notice of the widespread concerns about having a large number of these large casinos, and will give some assurances to Labour members of parliament that the government's plans are more moderate, but there will be some because they will help in the redevelopment of places like Blackpool where they will provide a shot in the arm.\"</p> <p>The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cardiff, Peter Smith, told the programme: \"The intention [of the bill] is clearly good. The law hasn't been reformed for over 40 years, and with the advent of modern technology there are many more opportunities for very unregulated betting.</p> <p>\"What the government seems to be saying is we want to reform the law, reduce crime, and protect children and the vulnerable. That's marvellous.</p> <p>\"But then they propose these huge casinos, which will have unlimited numbers of machines, which will be open perhaps for 24 hours, and it is then the vulnerable adults who can be caught in this and the social effects of obsessive gambling are dreadful.\"</p> <p>The Archbishop said he was unimpressed by the culture secretary Tessa Jowell's protest that the opposition to the casinos was tainted by a \"whiff of snobbery\".</p> <p>He said: \"I think that was rather ridiculous. It is nothing to do with snobbery or elitism. It is a genuine concern.</p> <p>\"There wasn't, in my mind, a great call for this from the public in general. And I think, to an extent, the government has misread the public mood on this.</p> <p>\"I hope the government will listen to the genuine concerns expressed through people's MPs.\"</p>",

  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday November 10, 2004</b> <br>  In the article below we refer to a Peace Now demonstration in Israel \"addressed by Ehud Olmert, none other than Sharon's deputy.\" In fact, although Mr Olmert was due to attend that demonstration (at the time of writing), in the end he did not do so.      If you can judge a man by the enemies he keeps, then Ariel Sharon is someone in urgent need of a reappraisal. Reviled for two decades as the Bulldozer, the embodiment of the intransigent Israeli right, yesterday he became something else - the unlikeliest standard bearer for those who yearn for progress in the Middle East. <p>You only had to look at those denouncing him, as he won an emphatic 67-45 vote in favour of his planned pullout from Gaza in the Knesset last night. The most zealous of the settlers, parading their children in their thousands outside the parliament, condemning the prime minister for the treachery of giving away land that, they insist, was bequeathed to the Jews by the Almighty Himself; the theocratic rabbis, ruling that all those who believe in the Torah are divinely compelled to oppose the PM; the nationalist politicians, heckling Sharon from the back of the Knesset chamber, telling this hawk of all hawks to \"go home\". </p> <p>Ariel Sharon has become public enemy number one to Israel's far right, which is why, if only temporarily, he deserves the support of the left - in Israel and beyond. In Israel, they gave it. It was not just the decision by Labour's 19 Knesset members, joined by the left-wing Meretz party, to back Sharon, in a bid to cancel out the almost equivalent number - nearly half - of his own Likud MKs who voted against him. It was also the sentiment of the wider peace movement, believing that - bizarre as it may seem - Sharon was, in this specific contest at least, their champion. The result was some surreal politics: witness the Peace Now demonstration addressed by Ehud Olmert, none other than Sharon's deputy. </p> <p>There is more to this than the simple calculus of \"my enemy's enemy\". By pushing for a Gaza withdrawal, whatever his long-term motives, Sharon is finally beginning a process which Israel's doves - to say nothing of the outside world - have sought for nearly four decades. At long last, Israel is proposing to rid itself of part of the territory it won in 1967. Not all of it, not even most of it, but some of it. And that, after 37 years of policy in the opposite direction, constantly tightening Israel's hold on those lands, is one of the most significant moments in the country's history. </p> <p>It is true that Sharon's destination is not the same as that of the Israeli peace camp. He wants to give away Gaza in return for keeping large chunks of the rest of the occupied territories. He said as much on Monday: his aim was to \"strengthen Israel's grip over the land that is crucial to our existence\" - in other words, parts of the West Bank. </p> <p>He may even believe, as his chief of staff said in an interview earlier this month, that this is the best way to put the peace process with the Palestinians into \"formaldehyde\", putting off the prospect of a genuine Palestinian state \"indefinitely\". </p> <p>The peacemaking left see things differently. For them, the Gaza withdrawal is the first move in a process that would see the bulk of the 1967 territories handed to the Palestinians. Put simply, the peace camp's plan is Gaza first. Sharon's plan may well be Gaza last. </p> <p>Despite that vast difference in long-term objectives, progressives understand they have to be on Sharon's side for now. His destination may be A, theirs may be Z, but the first step is the same - and, right now, he is the one with the power to make it. If only for this first step, the Gaza pullout, Sharon and the doves must walk together. </p> <p>The rewards are enormous. Sharon has done what no leader of the left could ever have done with as much national credibility: he has, at long last, taken on the settlers and challenged the logic of their cause. His Knesset speech was startling, chiefly because it came from him but also because of its content. He articulated views that once belonged to the peace movement alone: \"We do not wish to control millions of Palestinians who double their number each generation,\" Sharon said. \"A democratic Israel will not be able to withstand such a thing.\" </p> <p>He addressed the Palestinians themselves, apparently speaking of 1967 but perhaps even of the founding of the state in 1948: \"We did not seek to build our country on your ruins. We were attacked and we protected our lives with our backs to the sea. Many have lost their homes and have become refugees. This is the way of war, but war is not God's order.\" He quoted Menachem Begin's praise of the settlers as great pioneers - and his warning that they suffered from \"a complex of messianism\". For Sharon, so long the patron of the settlement project, to utter these words is a tectonic shift. He is a father turning on his children. </p> <p>Words, though, are the least of it. The planned dismantling of 21 Gaza settlements and a handful in the West Bank is the reason for the left's current embrace of Sharon. None have come down since 1982's evacuation of Yamit in Sinai and certainly none in the territories designated as Palestinian lands. If the prime minister sticks to his word, surviving another nailbiting vote next March, that taboo will at last be broken. Territorial compromise will no longer be an abstract horror, but a real, manageable prospect. </p> <p>What happens next? Politically, last night's Likud split suggests a realign ment of the Israeli landscape. The prime minister could sit atop a coalition of pragmatic Likud, Labour and the secular Shinui party. But Sharon is in a strong enough position to avoid such formal changes. He can simply maintain his current position, dominating the centre-ground of Israeli politics, and dare the Likud rebels, and would-be leader Bibi Netanyahu, to retreat to the far right. He knows they won't fall into that trap: the Israeli electorate supports the Gaza pullout and will not hand power to those who oppose it. </p> <p>More important, especially for the left, is the future of territorial concessions. Outsiders who have spent 37 years demanding an Israeli return to the 1967 borders and the removal of the settlements, should be taking careful note of these past 48 hours. A Gaza pullout could set a precedent for further withdrawals. On the other hand, if this is how difficult it is to leave Gaza - a luckless strip of land with only 7,000 settlers and few biblical resonances - then how much harder will it be for an Israeli government to pull out of the West Bank, with a Jewish population in the hundreds of thousands and a terrain even many moderate Israelis regard as the heart of the biblical homeland? If this is the treatment meted out to an arch-hawk like Sharon, now branded a traitorous friend of Yasser Arafat, what fate would await a dovish leader ready to go much further? </p> <p>Progressives should draw a double lesson from Sharon's move. First, sometimes even hate figures can become allies. Second, every slogan, every panacea, no matter how sound in theory, needs to survive in the chill wind of reality. These past few days have given us a blast of that cold air. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Dan, 46, is a senior executive officer who manages a jobcentre. He has been a career civil servant for the last 20 years and currently earns \u00a330,000. But he wants new challenges. <p>1. Understanding the issues facing unemployed adults puts Dan in a strong position to work for a local authority as a welfare to work manager. He would help unemployed people to overcome barriers to employment and assist them in sustaining a job. His understanding of this client group is invaluable, and in the post he would be responsible for teams as well as for managers. His income would increase to a maximum of \u00a336,000. <br><br> 2. Perhaps Dan would consider becoming a chief executive officer for a local charity organisation such as Age Concern, earning up to \u00a336,000. His experience of team management and the fact that he is adept at offering individual staff support is useful, as is his ability to manage a budget and his knowledge of partnership working. In the role, Dan would be the public face of the charity at a local level and would be expected to be an effective networker. <br><br> 3. If Dan wants to continue to work in employment, but focus on the needs of young people rather than adults, he might be tempted to manage a local Connexions centre - the government support service for young people - where he could earn up to \u00a336,000. This would make good use of his experience of working with different agencies, as well as his line management skills. His potential employers would expect him to have a passion for improving services for young people. <br><br> 4. Dan's civil service background and his understanding of government systems are the kind of qualities that Business Link is looking for. The national network offers advice, support and information to new and existing businesses. Although Dan has local business contacts, Business Link would be more keen to tap into his managerial expertise, particularly that of managing teams and dealing with a diverse group of clients. A variety of senior manager posts, with a salary of around \u00a330,000, are possible. <br><br> 5. Joining a thinktank is another option for Dan. It would use his two decades of experience and knowledge in a different way, but would result in a slight pay cut. Working as a public services researcher for the Demos thinktank, which is keen to recruit people from diverse backgrounds, is a possibility. It would offer Dan an interesting change and encourage him to reflect on the services he has managed throughout his career so far. The salary on offer is up to \u00a328,000</p>",
  "<p>People with mental health problems living in the community could be banned from leaving their homes under proposals to reform mental health law, a legal expert has warned.</p> <p>Under the controversial draft mental health bill, people under assessment or receiving care in the community must comply with a code of conduct imposed by their doctor, according to Phil Fennell, a professor from Cardiff University's law school.</p> <p>The professor said that the measure would exacerbate discrimination as it effectively treated mental health problems as a form of antisocial behaviour. </p> <p>The draft bill, which ministers expect to become law in 2007, states that mental health staff could impose \"a condition that the patient does not engage in specified conduct\". </p> <p>If the patient fails to comply with the conditions they could be forcibly detained in hospital. Speaking at a conference in London on mental health reform, Professor Fennell likened the code of conduct to antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos).</p> <p>The professor said: \"[The conditions] are like Asbos. For example, a person could be stopped from going out to the pub in the evening if it was considered their mental health problems could be exacerbated by drinking.</p> <p>\"It's a very wide power indeed especially when one considers that clinical supervisors [mental health staff] can decide to treat someone in hospital.\"</p> <p>Vicky Yeates, a senior law lecturer at the University of Glamorgan in Wales, raised concerns that the proposed legislation would make carers responsible for ensuring that patients did not break the code of conduct.</p> <p>Ms Yeates, whose daughter has mental health problems, said the measure would turn carers into jailers and push families already under pressure to breaking point.</p> <p>She said: \"Who will bear responsibility that your loved one isn't hauled off into hospital? The carer. You're effectively becoming a policing agent of the state. I think this will have a deleterious effect on an already strained relationship.\"</p> <p>The draft bill has faced overwhelming opposition from mental health professionals and service users. A revised version of the proposed legislation is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by an expert parliamentary committee.</p>",
  "<p>Nearly 40 years after his death, Gone With the Wind producer <strong>David O Selznick</strong> was yesterday awarded a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The honour was funded by the Producers' Guild in recognition of Selznick's unique contribution to Hollywood's golden age. Attending the ceremony, son Daniel Selznick felt that a wrong had finally been righted. \"My father's feelings were hurt when he wasn't included,\" he said. Selznick was one of the industry's most powerful figures during the 1940s and 50s. Despite being best known for Gone With the Wind, he also produced the likes of Duel in the Sun, A Star is Born and Rebecca. He died in 1965.</p> <p><strong>Robert Blake</strong>'s long-awaited murder trial came a step closer to court on Monday as potential jurors were summoned for selection. The 71-year-old star of In Cold Blood and the 70s TV show Baretta is charged with killing his estranged wife Bonnie Lee Bakley, who was shot outside a Los Angeles restaurant in May 2001. Blake pleads not guilty to the charge and has claimed that he was not with Bakley at the time of the shooting because he had returned to the restaurant to collect a gun that he had left at his table. The trial is set to begin next month.</p>",
  "<p>November's film magazines went head-to-head over their two favourite cinematic heart-throbs, Johnny Depp and Jude Law. <strong> Empire</strong> confessed it had \"always loved\" Depp and went to meet the \"coolest actor in the world\". They weren't disappointed: he was \"looking cooler than a penguin's picnic\" in Venice to promote his new movie Finding Neverland. </p> <p>Everyone loves the 41-year-old, gushed Will Lawrence. \"The butt-kissers adore him because of Captain Jack Sparrow, that dandified guide to box-office gold, but really they owe their adulation to JM Barrie.\" Finding Neverland, the story of how Barrie came to write Peter Pan, was shot before Pirates Of The Caribbean and \"its release was delayed so it wouldn't clash with PJ Hogan's disappointing 2003 interpretation of Pan.\" It was to give Depp the edge he needed. </p> <p>\"Without Barrie, Sparrow may not have been so riotously rambunctious, the most quixotic quipster to hit pirate land since a certain Captain Hook,\" said Lawrence, speculating that the actor might get an Oscar for his performance in Finding Neverland. But Depp isn't impressed by awards. \"Sure, I find it touching, honestly, but awards are not as important to me as when I meet a 10-year-old kid who says, 'I love Captain Jack Sparrow' ... That's real magic for me.\" </p> <p>Depp also graced the cover of <strong> Sight &amp; Sound</strong>, which examined why Finding Neverland deviated from the truth about the source of inspiration for the classic children's story Peter Pan. The film attributes it to Barrie's friendship with Sylvia Llewelyn-Davis, played by Kate Winslet, and her sons. </p> <p>It was, said Kevin Jackson, \"partly, one suspects, to make Barrie's intense interest in the family seem less creepy than it did to many witnesses in real life\", but mainly \"to give force to the film's most essential relationship, that of Barrie the child-man with Peter the man-child\". The film takes the line that Barrie's interest in the boys was not erotic, a view backed by one of the Llewelyn-Davis children, Nico, who wrote to Andrew Birkin, author of JM Barrie and the Lost Boys: \"All I can say for certain is that I ... never heard one word or saw one glimmer of anything approaching homosexuality or paedophilia: had he either of those leanings ... I would have been aware. He was an innocent - which is why he could write Peter Pan.\" </p> <p> <strong>Film Review</strong> believed Finding Neverland to be a masterpiece. It had it all: \"a terrific script, an ace cast and an involving intimate drama\". This was \"unquestionably one of the best pictures of the year\" and was destined \"to find nothing but critical approval and success\". </p> <p>With six films coming out in the next few months, Jude Law has secured his place on Hollywood's A-list, said <strong> Total Film</strong>. The 31-year old from Lewisham received a four-star cheer from Total Film for his starring role in the remake of Alfie. But how did the original Alfie, Michael Caine, feel about it? \"He's just an extraordinary man - so generous and gracious,\" Law told the magazine. \"He was also very respectful in that he didn't say, 'Do it like this.'\" </p> <p><strong>Hotdog</strong> wondered whether Law was worried about making Alfie too reprehensible. \"The interesting thing is how much can we get away with Alfie's treatment of women and philosophies of life on women. What surprised me was we really could. Because we all know people like that. People who get to their early 30s and realise that they're going to be pretty lonely if they continue living like this.\" </p> <p>Hotdog was left in no doubt that Law was \"about to become very big indeed\", a prediction boosted by his appearance in the sci-fi flick Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, The Aviator, Closer and I Heart Huckabees, which confirm him as \"the most interesting British star working out of Hollywood today\".</p>",
  "<p>For 21 years, Mark Serwotka put on his grey suit, popped his bowler hat on his faceless head, then went to the office to waste time - according to the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and Tory leader Michael Howard. But for the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) and his 312,000 members, that is nonsense. </p> <p>\"More people depend on services we deliver than any other part of the public sector,\" Serwotka insists. </p> <p>A benefits officer from the south Wales valley of Aberdare for more than two decades, Serwotka's career typifies those of his members, a quarter of whom are paid less than \u00a313,750. When he was elected general secretary in 2000 - he took office a year later - Serwotka was earning the full-time equivalent of \u00a316,500. He spent the last six years of his career as a part- timer so he could look after his two young daughters while his civil servant wife Ruth - on a marginally better salary - worked full time. </p> <p>A benefits officer's lot (starting salary \u00a310,300) is not a happy one. \"It is very stressful,\" Serwotka says. \"Nobody values your contribution. At its starkest, you had the public shouting at you - quite understandably at times because they are the most vulnerable in society - and had computers that didn't work properly. It was quite a stressful environment\". </p> <p>The union's membership can be found in every nook of civic life - museums, magistrates courts, parliamentary security, driving test centres, passport offices, Whitehall, the Inland Revenue and quangos. The common denominator is that they all work for services run by government. </p> <p>The truth is that the civil service was never sexy, earning the term \"bureaucrat\" more in contempt than as a mark of respect. But the profession is now being maligned as never before through the political prism of \"waste\" and \"efficiency\". </p> <p>Gordon Brown, claimed this summer that he could comfortably eliminate 100,000 civil service posts - just under one in five - on the back of last spring's efficiency review by Sir Peter Gershon, and with no perceivable damage to public service delivery. This breaks down roughly into 20,000 posts from local and regional government, and 84,000 from the central civil service. The shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, said he would match that with a freeze on civil service recruitment from the first day the Tories came to office, resulting in 100,000 fewer staff through natural waste over six years. </p> <p>Serwotka's members responded last week by voting overwhelmingly for their first national strike in 11 years - 265,000 of 312,000 were balloted (the rest exempt as they are employed in the private sector). The walkout, Serwotka says, \"will show government, but also the politicians and the public, the importance of the civil service, to make people realise how ingrained it is in society.\" </p> <p>Serwotka says he is angry at the false dichotomy between back office and frontline public sector delivery, which sees teachers and nurses lauded while \"faceless bureaucrats\" are considered wasteful and inefficient. </p> <p>He believes the slur is political manipulation intended to soften up the public over cuts, which he says are motivated by the government's desire to silence Tory claims that the civil service has become fat under Labour, to the tune of 55,000 more posts. \"We are delivering things the government has brought in through legislation,\" says Serwotka. \"The minimum wage, tax credits ... someone has to deliver them, and we supported Brown on it.\" </p> <p>He claims the cuts are not about efficiency, but \"about crude headcounts, to achieve reductions because of party politics.\" </p> <p>Serwotka learned of the cuts from TV - announced by the chancellor as part of his spending review speech last summer. He disputes Brown's assurances that public service delivery will remain unscathed by such a haemorrhaging of staff. He says: \"If that had any shred of truth, you can conclude that there are 100,000 people at work with nothing to do, which is clearly nonsense, or that he will make the cuts in services by using private companies. The third option is that he will have an army of casual workers who will not figure in headcounts. The only way he can protect services is to do one of these three things, which I think are all the wrong routes.\" </p> <p>Efficiencies could still be made, says Serwotka, listing the \"constructive suggestions\" his union has submitted to the government. For example, the government could make considerable savings by scrapping the 229 different civil service pay negotiations and replacing them with national bargaining, he says. This would bring parity to a sector that has salary variations of up to \u00a33,000 between departments for similar posts. Calling time on private government contracts, which are often millions of pounds over budget, and on the \u00a33.5bn lavished by government on private consultants could also make potential savings. </p> <p>The union wants an end to private contracts that fail. As for Brown's calls for wiser spending, Serwotka agrees that this has huge savings potential. \"We have made suggestions, but we have been ignored,\" he says. </p> <p>Serwotka, the adopted son of a south Welsh mother and a Polish electronic engineer father, makes no secret of his leftwing tendencies. He began his union career within a month of his first job, aged 16. But he denies that he is \"strike-happy\". He says: \"When you have a dialogue of the deaf you need to do something to make them notice.\" The national strike will be the sign language of choice. The union is getting quite good at striking, having notched up half a million strike days this year. </p> <p>Serwotka is graced with a winning, demotic leadership style, and is not above asserting his successes. Since taking over the reins in 2001, membership has soared 23%, and in the past two months 2,000 new members have joined, making it probably the fastest growing union at a time of general membership decline. </p> <p>The national strike will be in pursuit of five demands aside from the headline job cuts, covering pensions, the proposed relocation of 20,000 civil servants from London and the south-east, plans to reduce sickness benefits, and a freeze on the privatisation of services. </p> <p>A tad ambitious perhaps? \"It will be an incredible success in terms of showing who the membership of our trade union are, and I think there will be central discussions that will address some of these concerns. If not, we are clear the campaign will continue.\" </p> <p>Next Friday's strike is part of a wider campaign to dispel the myths surrounding the futility of civil servants, but a large equal-pay claim is also making its way through the courts, demonstrating that the union will resort to legal action. </p> <p>Serwotka is skilled at using the media and politicians.

  "<p><strong>GLORY, GLORY, THAMES, ERM...</strong></p> <p><strong>\"During the recent coverage of QPR's record sequence of victories, a list was published of their record run back in Division Three South in the early 1930s,\"</strong> explains Ian Pugh. <strong>\"One of the teams they beat was \"hames. I've never heard of this team. Where did they play? Did they change their name? Or did they merely fold?\"</strong></p> <p>Thames started life in 1928 and finished it very shortly after, Ian. The club was founded by the owners of West Ham stadium, home not to West Ham United but to speedway and greyhounds, who were looking for ways to make some extra cash.</p> <p>The club started life in the Southern League, finishing third in their second season and pipping Aldershot to a spot in the Third Division when Merthyr weren't re-elected. Over the next two seasons Thames played 84 games, won 20, drew 17, and lost 47 - conceding 202 goals along the way. No surprise then that they finished bottom with just 23 points in 1931-32, and promptly resigned from the league. Bad news for Leyton Orient, fellow strugglers hankering after a merger (and cheap rent); good news for Aldershot, who replaced them.</p> <p>Thames did set one record in their brief existence however, and it's one they still hold: the lowest league attendance for a single game. Despite playing home games in a 50,000 capacity stadium, the glut of local sides meant Thames never really cut it on the east London scene. The atmosphere must have been electric on December 6 1930, when Thames beat Luton Town 1-0 in front of a whopping 469 fans.</p> <p><strong>AN ENTIRE XI OF BLACK OR MIXED-RACE PLAYERS</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Has any European nation or Premiership team ever fielded an entire XI of black or mixed-race players?\"</strong> asks David Ehindero.</p> <p>Not quite David, but we've found a few that come close. Alex Usher refers us to the case of Beveren, Arsenal's feeder club in Belgium. \"A few years ago, in order to beat a cash crunch, it let go nearly all its European players and turned itself into a showcase for players from Ivory Coast. Igor Stepanovs was frequently the only white player on the team.\"</p> <p>Which is true; and when Stepanovs concluded his loan period he was replaced by a player from, yes, the Ivory Coast.</p> <p>Why this fondness for Ivorian players? Well, feeder clubs also have feeder clubs, and Beveren source their stars from one of Africa's biggest clubs, ASEC Abidjan. Under the terms of the deal between the two clubs, ASEC supply at least four talented youngsters to the Belgians each season, though it is often more.</p> <p>After ASEC won the African Champions League in 1998, for example, all of their senior players moved to European clubs, mainly to Beveren. When the Super Cup came around just one month later, ASEC proved their resourcefulness by sending out their U-17 team to face Esp\u00e9rance de Tunis. The youngsters won 3-1, with 15 year-old Zezeto scoring twice. Guess who signed for Beveren a short time later.</p> <p>As for England, Clive Vedmore says: \"The nearest is the XI that Arsenal fielded away at Leeds on 28 September, 2002, when nine of the team were either black or mixed-race. The team was as follows: Seaman, Lauren, Campbell, Cygan, Cole, Toure, Vieira, Gilberto, Wiltord, Henry, Kanu.\"</p> <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Who was the first player to miss a penalty in a shoot-out in a football match in Britain?\"</strong> asked Albert Lippett, a couple of years back.</p> <p>On August 1 1970, a full-strength Manchester United team found themselves in Hull, playing in the semi-final of the Watney Mann Invitation Cup. The tournament was restricted to the two highest scoring teams from each Division - excluding those recently promoted, relegated or in Europe. United made it by scoring 66 goals as they finished 8th in the First Division, while Hull qualified by topping the Second Division scoring charts with 72 goals in 42 games.</p> <p>The FA had decided to allow - for the first time - penalty shoot-outs to be used if the matches were tied. Both Hull and United made it through their quarter-finals (against Reading and Peterborough respectively) and, when their match finished 1-1 after extra time, the scene was set for the world's first penalty shoot-out.</p> <p>George Best took the first penalty, scoring low to the keeper's right. The next five penalties were also dispatched with ease. And then Denis Law stepped up and saw his penalty saved by Ian McKechnie, thus becoming the first player ever to miss in a shoot-out.</p> <p>Not that it mattered too much. Hull missed their next two penalties and United sneaked through to the final. You know the rest: that year the shoot-out was adopted by Uefa and Fifa, and before long England and missed penalties were going together as nicely as butter and hot toast.</p> <p>For more from the Knowledge archive, click <a href=\"http://football.theguardian.com/theknowledge/\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>MOST DISALLOWED GOALS</strong></p> <p><strong>\"What's the most disallowed goals scored in a match?\"</strong> asks Jonathan Malpass.</p> <p>John Hilditch fondly recalls going to Elland Road \"around 1997\" to watch his beloved Arsenal sneak an undeserved 0-0 after Leeds had three goals ruled out - each time for offside and twice in two minutes for Brian Deane.</p> <p>\"Their fans weren't too happy afterwards, so it was a case of shut up, walk quickly and get out of here.\" Wise man, John.</p> <p>Neil Lavery remembers Burnley having three disallowed in the first half hour at Charlton in the 1994/5 season, but when it comes to hard-luck stories, Jon Brown reckon we need not cast our mind back any further than October 16 (which may still be too tricky for some), when Lincoln City had four goals disallowed in the opening thirty minutes of their clash with Oxford United.</p> <p>After painstaking research, however, The Knowledge can beat that: on April 2 2000, Celtic had four goals chalked off in 17 minutes against Kilmarnock, including three from a distraught Tommy Johnson. Needless to say, they still won the match 4-2.</p> <p><strong>STANDING ROOM ONLY, IN PEDANTS' CORNER</strong></p> <p><a href=\" http://football.theguardian.com/theknowledge/story/0,13854,1330963,00.html\">Last week</a> we looked at national player managers. This week, we stand (semi-)corrected.</p> <p>We insisted that Mark Hughes had never been Wales player-manager. But, as James Kettle points out: \"For the game against Denmark at Anfield on June 9 1999, Hughes and Neville Southall were joint caretaker managers - appointed on level pegging. And Hughes played in the game to earn his last cap. So for that game only, he was certainly a bona-fide player-manager.\"</p> <p>We'll give you that one, but not Brian from the USA's suggestion that Peter Doherty was player-manager of Northern Ireland. According to our research, it would seem Doherty was player-manager of Doncaster Rovers between 1949 and 1953, when he retired from playing, and only later was he appointed Northern Ireland boss for qualifying for the 1958 World Cup.</p> <p>Also<a href=\" http://football.theguardian.com/theknowledge/story/0,13854,1330963,00.html\"> last week</a>, we dredged up a knowledge archive regarding the 1982 Southampton side and their six past or future England captains.

  "<p>Kevin Pietersen said yesterday that the influence of his old sparring partner Shane Warne was the major factor in his decision to sign a three-year contract with Hampshire. </p> <p>\"Warney said to me that I could play on flat wickets and get 1500 runs, or have a challenge here,\" said Pietersen. \"I could sit in the comfort zone but I am a bloke who likes to set himself challenges.\"</p> <p>It seemed unlikely that he and Warne would ever hit it off after the Australian subjected the South African-born batsman to a tirade of abuse when Hampshire played Nottinghamshire this year.</p> <p>\"It was pretty confrontational,\" Pietersen said. \"To become a mate of his will do me the world of good. He won't come out and verbally nail me like during the barrage I took at Trent Bridge. Warney is a genius. I can't wait to be playing alongside him.\"</p> <p>Warne feels Hampshire could not have a better recruit. \"I believe that Kevin Pietersen is the most exciting prospect on the county circuit,\" he said. \"He is a real match-winner and a welcome addition to our great squad who will fit in with our guys beautifully.</p> <p>\"I was very impressed with him when we played each other and I am very excited to have a player of his quality join us. I will do all I can to assist his development.\"</p> <p>The leg-spinner also believes Hampshire's latest signing will offer more than runs. \"As well as strengthening our batting, his off-spinners will be an added bonus.\"</p> <p>The team manager Paul Terry added: \"I am delighted that we have picked up a player of Kevin's class. [He's] the explosive batsman that I feel we have lacked.\"</p> <p>The middle-order batsman, who has been selected for England's one-day tour of Zimbabwe, claims he is content to slot in anywhere in the Hampshire batting order and feels he will be happy at his new home. \"I see the passion of the club,\" he says. \"It's amazing.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Stephen Fleming batted himself into the record books and New Zealand into a commanding position on the opening day of the second Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong.</p> <p>Fleming, at the age of 31, not only passed Sir Richard Hadlee's record total of 86 Test match appearances for New Zealand but also became his country's highest run-scorer in Tests, making a superb century against the embattled hosts.</p> <p>He finished the day on 137 not out, passing the record of Martin Crowe who scored 5,444 runs in 77 Tests, as New Zealand closed in total control on 338 for three.</p>",
  "<p>For the 3,000 Britons who will run in the New York City marathon next month the most important thing will be to finish the 26.2-mile race, in order to achieve a sense of personal fulfilment.</p> <p>But for Paula Radcliffe far more is at stake. If she fails to complete the course that starts on the Verrazano Narrows Bridge on Staten Island and passes through New York's five boroughs before finishing in Central Park, it may deal her career a fatal blow and forever brand her as a quitter.</p> <p>That may seem harsh on a woman who has achieved far more than any other British female distance runner, but another failure so soon after the Olympics would make it hard to shake off that public perception. She must be aware that among the things her double Olympic disappointment inspired were a spoof column in Private Eye and a series of jokes on the Harry Hill show.</p> <p>The decision of the Bedford runner to enter such a high-profile event so soon after dropping out of the marathon in Athens at 35 kilometres and five days later the 10,000 metres with eight laps remaining has caught everyone by surprise.</p> <p>\"Paula will obviously have to go into [the race] with her eyes wide open,\" said Zara Hyde-Peters, UK Athletics' head of development and one of the few people in whom Radcliffe regularly confides. \"There are always going to be external pressures. She's pleased to be doing the race and that's a very good sign.\"</p> <p>The advice of most experts - and even her own father - after the traumatic chain of events she experienced in Greece was to rest, regroup and try to come back stronger next year. Peter Radcliffe, a former brewery executive whose own modest marathon career inspired his daughter, had originally urged her to get back to enjoying the sport again but has now backed the late decision to sign up for the world's most famous race. \"I have not spoken to her about it,\" he said. \"I hope it goes well. I'm sure she would not have entered it if she did not think she could do well.\"</p> <p>Fitness should not be a problem for Radcliffe, who has run thousands of miles in training this year. \"I would hope that this signals her recovery from the issues she had in Athens,\" said Alan Storey, the head of endurance for UK Athletics.</p> <p>Nevertheless, some coaches and former marathon runners believe Radcliffe is playing Russian roulette with her career by risking causing even more damage, physically and psychologically. </p> <p>\"She's seen the doctor, she's had blood tests, she has seen the osteopath,\" said Hyde-Peters. \"They think she is in very good shape. There's always an element of risk for every runner. But if there were any risk Paula would always act on the side of caution.</p> <p>\"She knows what not feeling herself feels like. After a very stressful summer I'd like to see her enjoy herself. I think it's driven by her desire to get back on the bike. There are no major championships on the horizon and this is entirely in Paula's hands. She and her coach think she can do it.</p> <p>\"I can see why people are surprised. I think she made the decision very recently without the normal time you would have to prepare for a marathon. But given the high level of training she maintains throughout the year, perhaps it's not such a shock.\"</p> <p>Others believe Radcliffe, a keen student of the sport, is being driven by a sense of a history. \"If you talk in terms of there being a grand slam of marathons she has won two of them [London and Chicago] and the opportunities to run New York when she is in shape before the end of her career will probably be few,\" said Geoff Wightman, Radcliffe's former agent who was once one of Britain's top marathon runners. \"Perhaps she's grabbing that opportunity.\" </p> <p>But the truth is that whatever happens in New York, Radcliffe is in a no-win situation. If she crosses the line first she will continue to endure the unfair jibes that she is someone who cannot succeed when the pressure is really on. If she does not win, it may set her confidence back even further.</p> <p>The truth is that if she is trying to put a postscript on 2004 she will never properly put it behind her. Perhaps, rather than chasing a dream that is no longer there, she should just close the door on that chapter of her life.</p>",

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>SHARON GETS HIS WAY OVER GAZA PULLOUT</b></p> <p>The vote was historic, according to the Guardian and the Independent, while the Herald Tribune describes it as an occasion of \"profound symbolism\". </p> <p>Ariel Sharon won what he called the most important vote of his life last night as the Israeli parliament backed his plan to remove all 21 Israeli settlements from Gaza. Around 8,000 settlers will be affected. It was the first time in 37 years that the Knesset had voted to remove Jewish settlements from Palestinian territories, and the Israeli prime minister said it could pave the way for peace. </p> <p>But the vote on the disengagement plan, which a newspaper poll suggests is supported by 65% of the Israeli public, came after a fraught day of high drama and bitter debate. The IHT also warns that the victory, of 67 votes to 45, \"does not guarantee implementation\" and was narrower than anticipated. The withdrawal is supposed to start next April or May, but there will be further votes.</p> <p>Last night Mr Sharon sacked two of his ministers, Uzi Landau and Michael Ratzon, after they voted against the plan. Today the prime minister is left with a split cabinet and party; almost half of the Likud party opposed the disengagement. Commentators say Mr Sharon will probably have to either put together a new coalition with Labour or call early elections. </p> <p>The Telegraph reports that protestors called Mr Sharon a traitor and \"extremists scrawled graffiti calling for his assassination\". </p> <p>His main rival, the finance minister Benjamin Netanyahu, voted for the plan stony-faced - entering the chamber late to increase the tension - and then demanded a referendum. Mr Sharon rejected this, saying it would just delay the decision. </p> <p>The Guardian hailed the vote as a \"landmark moment for both parties\" against a \"background of unrelieved gloom about the prospects for peace\". </p> <p>The newspaper criticised settlements \"built on confiscated land with swimming pools and beautifully tended lawns behind the barbed wire\" and contrasted them with the poor conditions endured by one and a half million Palestinians. The settlements have no legal or moral justification and \"it is right that they should go\", the Guardian said. </p> <p>The leader concludes: \"Leaving the Gaza strip is a necessary but not sufficient condition to establish peace. Gaza's liberation can be first. It will mean little if it also turns out to be last.\"</p> <p>The Times has a Brooke cartoon entitled Gaza Strip (with figleaf) depicting Mr Sharon taking his clothes off with only a figleaf protecting his modesty. </p> <p>In the Guardian, Jonathan Freedland argued that as Ariel Sharon has become public enemy number one to Israel's far right, he temporarily deserves the support of the left. </p> <p>\"Put simply, the peace camp's plan is Gaza first. Sharon's plan may well be Gaza last. Despite that vast difference in long-term objectives, progressives understand they have to be on Sharon's side for now ... If only for this first step, the Gaza pullout, Sharon and the doves must walk together.\" </p> <p>But the IHT strikes a more cautious note. \"Religious conservatives... oppose the plan, saying that it is a sin to pull Jews from their homes and that Gaza is part of the Land of Israel given to Jews by God. Palestinians, of course, have a different view of God's intentions.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,1336550,00.html\">Out but not over</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/comment/0,10551,1336756,00.html\">Jonathan Freedland: I'm backing Sharon</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/26/news/israel.html\">IHT: Israeli parliament backs Gaza pullout</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/27/wmid27.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/10/27/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Gaza plan survives revolt</a></p> <p><b>JOHN PEEL DIES</b></p> <p>The Sun says the music world is in mourning for \"the legend of radio\".

  "<p>Telecoms watchdog Ofcom will raise the prospect of greatly reducing the regulatory burden on BT in certain markets, such as the City of London, when it publishes the long awaited second part of its review of the telecoms market next month. In the report, expected on November 18, Ofcom will also rule out breaking up BT in practice but will try to emulate a structural separation of the company's wholesale and retail arms by imposing tighter regulation on areas where BT has dominance. </p> <p>In these areas, termed bottlenecks, the regulator wants to introduce the concept of equivalence, where all operators are treated in the same way by BT's wholesale business. The most obvious, and contentious, bottleneck is the last piece of copper wire between a house or business premises and the local BT exchange, known as the local loop. In return for stricter control of the way it deals with its rivals in these bottlenecks, BT had been looking for Ofcom to roll back regulation in other parts of the telecoms industry where it believe it does not have dominant position, such as the City. </p> <p>Ofcom is not going to give BT completely free rein in this market as the regulator is understood to have talked with several of BT's corporate customers who still think it has significant market power. But regulation will be reined back. </p> <p>The regulator's second consultation document will also represent the start of a rebalancing of the way that regulation has operated in the UK telecoms market, in a move which is likely to infuriate some recent market entrants. </p> <p>Over the past few years telecoms regulation has concentrated on giving service providers - many of whom have not invested in infrastructure - access to incumbent networks. There is a growing realisation among regulators and politicians that to induce companies to build next generation networks, regulation needs to ensure that infrastructure players can be certain of the returns they will make on their investment over the long term.</p>",
  "Documents obtained by the Guardian disclose today how one of the world's biggest tobacco companies, British American Tobacco, was able to put private pressure on Tony Blair and a cabinet minister who wanted to hold an inquiry into allegations that the firm was colluding with criminals. <p>Behind the back of parliament and public, the head of British American Tobacco (BAT), Martin Broughton, obtained access to Mr Blair at a private breakfast, followed by an equally private meeting with the then trade secretary, Stephen Byers. </p> <p>These unpublicised privileges were granted despite the fact that his company stood accused of colluding in cigarette smuggling on an unprecedented scale. </p> <p>Two former senior Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) officials on BAT's payroll were also used to approach their former departmental colleagues. </p> <p>After this behind-the-scenes lobbying, Mr Byers' own plan for an inquiry, which could have published a highly damaging report, was dropped. </p> <p>Instead, MPs were told that a watered-down inquiry would be conducted in secret. Its activities were \"buried\" for almost four years, after which it emerged that no action was to be taken. BAT was so pleased with the eventual form the inquiry took that their lobbyists described it, in a private note, as \"not a problem\". </p> <p>The Guardian is publishing the documents on its website today. </p> <p>The papers, obtained partly thanks to Whitehall's moves towards freedom of information, and partly from BAT's archives, record how powerful the private influence of large corporations can be. </p> <p>This power is evident today as BAT and other tobacco companies lobby against moves to force them to put graphic photographs, such as smoke-damaged organs and clogged arteries, on their cigarette packets to warn of the dangers of smoking. </p> <p>Four years ago, pressure mounted on Mr Broughton, the \u00a31.4m-a-year chairman of BAT, after this newspaper published documents detailing how the London-based corporation condoned tax evasion in a global effort to boost sales. </p> <p>According to the documents, BAT arranged to supply massive numbers of cigarettes to wholesalers and distributors, expecting that they would find their way into crooked hands and on to the black markets of developing countries after being smuggled across national borders, without duty being paid. </p> <p>Stephen Byers was threatening to set up an inquiry into the world's second biggest tobacco firm and publish the results. </p> <p>Such a report might be highly damaging for BAT, opening the door to lawsuits from foreign governments cheated of taxes and unable to enforce public health standards. </p> <p>In early 2000, BAT's lobbyists tracked sessions of a House of Commons all-party health committee inquiry into smoking, reporting back to the company's Thames-side headquarters that the then health secretary, Alan Milburn, was unsympathetic. </p> <p>\"He showed little interest in working with tobacco companies ... suggesting distrust of the companies' motives,\" warned a lobbyist in February 2000. Another noted: \"Milburn had read the serious allegations in the Guardian article and commented that the government abhors this behaviour\". </p> <p>Mr Broughton's first reaction was to approach Mr Milburn's colleague, Stephen Byers, privately. \"A constructive working relationship,\" was required, said Mr Broughton, a non-smoker, adding: \"I am writing therefore to ask for a meeting with you\". </p> <p>BAT, with the former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke on its board, hoped the DTI, in its role as \"sponsor\" of British industry, might provide a more sympathetic channel than the health department. </p> <p>But Mr Broughton got the cold shoulder. Mr Byers was close to the anti-smoking Alan Milburn, and refused to grant the tobacco chief an audience. </p> <p>A DTI minute stated: \"The company has made a number of attempts to meet DTI ministers since the election, but until now all requests have been declined.\" </p> <p>One of BAT's inhouse lobbyists, Simon Millson, made contact with the official heading the DTI's tobacco desk, Julian Ebsworth: \"I tried to pursue the issue on whether we would get a meeting. He said that was for the minister to decide 'given all the other issues' ... I sense some buck-passing going on\". </p> <p>In March, Mr Byers signalled that he planned to set up an inquiry under section 432 of the Companies Act, allowing files to be seized, employees to be questioned on oath, and - crucially - permitted Mr Byers to \"cause any such report to be ... published\". </p> <p>Mr Broughton immediately wrote to Stephen Byers again, on March 9, claiming the smuggling allegations were \"highly partisan\". His plea was shuffled off to the Treasury, nominally responsible for smuggling issues. </p> <p>A few days later, however, everything changed. Mr Broughton was able to go over Mr Byers' head, as a member of a shadowy group of privileged lobbyists - the \"multinational chairman's group\", whose members include BP, Shell, the drinks firm Diageo, Unilever, and Vodafone. </p> <p>Mr Broughton was on the shortlist of those invited to eat bacon and eggs with the prime minister in the Downing Street stateroom overlooking the rose garden. </p> <p>Mr Byers, too, had been summoned to the breakfast table by Mr Blair on March 14. The company chairman seized the opportunity, button-holing the minister who had been avoiding him. After shaking hands in No 10, Mr Byers was left with no alternative but to change his tune. \"In the margins of that breakfast briefing,\" as an official note records, \"the secretary of state agreed to [a] meeting\". </p> <p>That afternoon, BAT's lobbyists rang the department in triumph: \"Mr Broughton has secured a meeting with the secretary of state\". </p> <p>Mr Millson later boasted : \"It was said we have been very successful in getting the one-to-one meeting with Byers ... There are few companies that have achieved this.\" </p> <p>\"Dear Martin\", Mr Byers wrote back, in warmer nomenclature than before. He apologised for the \"error\" in redirecting his earlier letter. </p> <p>The secretary of state had been pressured into a private meeting with a firm into which he was trying to order an official inquiry. By contrast, ASH, the anti-smoking campaigners, say they asked for a similar meeting with Mr Byers, and were refused. </p> <p>Mr Broughton followed up with intensive lobbying of No 10, sending Mr Blair a long letter demanding that he cut taxes on cigarettes, and hinting that smuggling would continue unabated into Britain if he did not cooperate: \"The chosen tax policy contains within it the seeds of its own destruction.\" </p> <p>In April, he told BAT shareholders at the annual general meeting: \"There is really no need for a DTI investigation.\" </p> <p>Whitehall refuses to release the minutes of the subsequent meeting with Mr Byers. But we obtained BAT's version from their archive, which they have been forced to disclose in settlement of a US lawsuit. </p> <p>Mr Byers, with Julian Ebsworth at his side, appeared to accept that his department's job was to support the tobacco industry \"stating the DTI was a sponsor of the arms industry and that, although many did not like it 'we had to deal with it'.\" </p> <p>Mr Broughton demanded the DTI back BAT in its legal fight against the government of Colombia, which was bringing a lawsuit in the US over the smuggling allegations. BAT's minute claims: \"On Colombia litigation, Byers was unequivocal; he will do whatever he can\". </p> <p>Afterwards, BAT used its private links to Mr Byers' officials to get some background. Nicola Shears, who had spent eight years at the DTI, was on BAT's payroll. So was Ray Mingay, recent former head of export promotion at the DTI. Both talked to officials on BAT's behalf, according to the documents. </p> <p>Mr Byers himself, according to associates, had no idea that Mr Mingay was now working for BAT. He was shocked when told the former civil servant had been contacting his senior officials behind his back. </p> <p>\"Subsequent to the [Byers] meeting,\" Mr Millson wrote, \"Nicola Shears and myself have learned that Byers and the two civil servants present felt the meeting went well. They were impressed with Martin ... who put his points across clearly and succinctly\". </p> <p>Significantly, Mr Millson wrote: \"It was also recognised that BAT is one of Britain's 'world-class' companies\". </p> <p>This is one of the terms repeatedly used by the DTI and by Downing Street to justify explicitly business-friendly policies. </p> <p>The threatened inquiry ran into the sand after that. Friends of Mr Byers say his civil servants tried to persuade him to cancel it, claiming there was insufficient evidence. </p> <p>Mr Byers insisted it go ahead, maintaining he had no alternative when the health committee were calling for an investigation. </p> <p>Yet Mr Byers was persuaded to make a crucial change. Instead of ordering an inquiry under Section 432, which would have led to a public report, he agreed to use Section 447 of the Companies Act which, crucially for the company, prohibited publication. </p> <p>One of BAT's lobbyists, John Roberts, subsequently emailed a colleague dismissively: \"The DTI inquiry is a distraction, not a problem.\" </p> <p>And so it proved to be. The DTI buried their \"inquiry\" for an extraordinary length of time - almost four years, during which they released no information whatever, and Mr Byers left the scene. </p> <p>When protests mounted, officials finally announced, under a new trade secretary, Patricia Hewitt, that they had found insufficient evidence for legal action. Campaigners point out that the blanket secrecy guarantees no one can check the genuineness of their work. </p> <p>A spokesman for BAT said lst night: \"We have always maintained we acted legally.\" </p> <p>He denied that the two ex-DTI employees had had \"undue influence over the DTI\".</p>",

  "India responded coolly yesterday to suggestions by the Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, on how to solve the Kashmir dispute between the two countries. <p>General Musharraf said on Monday that Pakistan and India should consider making some areas of Kashmir independent, placing them under joint Indian-Pakistani control, or putting them under the administration of the United Nations. </p> <p>He said such options could only be implemented after the two countries withdrew their forces from Kashmir, where they are separated by a heavily militarised ceasefire line. </p> <p>Such a stand-down before a final solution is widely seen as unlikely. That Gen Musharraf raised such ideas, though, was seen as a diplomatic advance. </p> <p>Refusing to comment on the substance of the proposals presented to journalists by Gen Musharraf, Indian external affairs ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said that they should have been raised through diplomatic channels. </p> <p>\"We do not believe that Jammu and Kashmir is a subject on which discussions can be held through the media,\" he said.</p>",
  "Iraqis campaigning to end the occupation of our country have been shocked to hear the harsh criticisms levelled at the Stop the War coalition by leaders of the trade union Unison and others. It must also be a source of dismay to the many thousands of union and Labour activists who consistently opposed the war of aggression on Iraq and continue to campaign to bring the troops home. <p>This unwelcome diversion follows the Labour conference voting to reject a call for an early date to be set for the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq. The vote was a blow to the Iraqi people's struggle for liberation and democracy at a critical time in the murderously ruthless occupation of our country. Britain's role might not be decisive militarily, but it is the one country important enough to provide the Bush administration with the fig leaf it desperately seeks to convince the American people that there is international support for its war policies. Tony Blair's propaganda value in the US means that British withdrawal would have a huge impact on the US public. </p> <p>What has startled many anti-occupation Iraqis is that Stop the War, the broadest anti-war mass movement Britain has ever seen, is being criticised for sectarianism. And all because it is refusing to cosy up to an organisation that masquerades as an anti-occupation council of trade unions in Iraq. </p> <p>Outside Iraq, this organisation calls itself the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), but inside the country uses the same name (the General Federation of Workers' Trade Unions in Iraq) as the \"yellow\" unions set up by Saddam Hussein. Paul Bremer, President Bush's proconsul in Iraq until this summer, eventually blessed the decision of his Iraqi Governing Council to recognise one of at least two outfits claiming to take up the mantle of the GFWTUI (and hence legally control its massive assets and individual unions). That outfit is none other than the IFTU of today. But of course it is not the only trade union federation, nor is it recognised by most people attempting to create independent unions as their representative. These include the oil workers union in Basra and the Federation of Workers Councils and Trade Unions. There are also other ad-hoc federations led by Islamists, and Kurdish parties in Iraqi Kurdistan. </p> <p>The question is why the occupation authorities chose to recognise the IFTU as the sole federation in Iraq. The answer is that most IFTU leaders belong to the Iraqi Communist party, which had a proud record under the British-imposed regime in the 1950s and afterwards but which made the mistake of going into government with Saddam's Ba'ath party in the 70s, and since the early 90s has lost its bearings entirely. Within three months of the invasion it switched its official policy to active cooperation with the occupation when it joined Bremer's governing council. Today the party has one senior and two junior ministers in the longtime CIA asset Ayad Allawi's regime. Allawi, himself a former senior Saddamist, also leads a CIA-funded organisation, the Iraqi National Accord, composed of former Saddam loyalists in the armed forces and security services. These now control the key ministries of defence, the interior and national security. </p> <p>Allawi's party and the ICP - whose leader was recently described in the Financial Times as \"the US's ideal partner\" in Iraq - are now close allies. Hence the IFTU's efforts to support Blair's abortive attempt to invite Allawi to address the Labour conference. That should have alerted trade unions and Labour delegates to the role being played by the IFTU and the way it has been used by the Blair government. </p> <p>Abdullah Muhsin, the IFTU's international representative, led the campaign to invite Allawi and pleaded with trade union and Labour delegates not to support the call for an early withdrawal of Britain's forces. Despite his denials, his opposition to the conference resolution calling for an early date for withdrawal was published in the party's daily briefing to delegates and was widely distributed in advance of the debate. </p> <p>Muhsin has been upset at accusations of collaboration. I for one would be happy to drop such an emotive term if someone could suggest a more apposite description of an organisation that: gets backing from the occupation authorities in preference to all other unions and federations; does not campaign within Iraq against the occupation; says not a word about Iraq's real ruler at Saddam's Republican Palace in Baghdad, US ambassador John Negroponte; attacks all those resisting the occupation as terrorists and echoes Bush and Blair in their portrayal of popular resistance to occupation as one and the same as the criminal acts of a hoodlum like Zarqawi; supports the prolongation of the occupation by opposing the setting of an early date for the troops' withdrawal; actively supports an occupation-imposed puppet regime that, following a Bremer decree, enacted Saddam's 1987 law banning strikes and unions in the state sector; and fails to campaign against the US bombardment of Iraqi cities. </p> <p>Now it has emerged that the IFTU has been in discussions with the British Council about accepting funds from the British government - which has invaded and occupied our homeland - to support its activities in Iraq. </p> <p>Instead of accusing them of \"cultural imperialism\", Muhsin and the IFTU should be saluting those in Britain who recognise the legitimacy of the Iraqi people's resistance to an illegal war and occupation, and end their deep involvement with the occupation-appointed authorities. </p> <p>Trade unions and anti-war campaigners need to reject this latest diversion, as Tony Woodley of the transport union has urged, increase the pressure for the withdrawal of British forces and support the Iraqi people's struggle for liberation and democracy. In considering the IFTU leaders' arguments in support of the US-installed Allawi regime, we bear in mind the slogan which is chanted by Iraqis as they gather near homes destroyed by US bombardment, after their tears for the dead and injured give way to anger. It damns Allawi as both a coward and an agent of the US: \"Ya Allawi ya jaban, ya ameel il-Amreekan!\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sami Ramadani was a political refugee from Saddam Hussein's regime and is a senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sami.ramadani@londonmet.ac.uk\">sami.ramadani@londonmet.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Britain's second largest full-service airline, BMI, will today announce the abrupt departure of its chief executive, Austin Reid, in a boardroom reshuffle at the privately owned company. </p> <p>Staff at the Derby-based airline were told yesterday that Mr Reid, 59, was retiring a year early and had been replaced with immediate effect by the airline's chief financial officer, Nigel Turner. </p> <p>Insiders suggested that the change was a sign that BMI's founder and chairman, Sir Michael Bishop, was reasserting control over the airline. Sir Michael owns 50.1% of the shares, with the rest held by Lufthansa and SAS. </p> <p>In a statement to employees yesterday, Sir Michael said: \"Austin has made an immensely important contribution to the development of the BMI group over the past 19 years and we all wish him a healthy, lengthy and happy retirement.\" BMI lost \u00a39.8m last year, after falling \u00a319.6m into the red the year before.

There have also been rumours about a possible deal with Exeter-based FlyBe. </p> <p>BMI's legal director, Tim Bye, was yesterday appointed deputy chief executive and Alex Grant was appointed chief operations officer. </p> <p>BMI has established a successful low-cost offshoot, BmiBaby, to tackle competition from Ryanair and easyJet.</p>",
  "<p>In recent months concerted efforts by anti-abortion organisations, and their supporters in the press, have created a frenzy of activity around the emotive and complex issue of late abortion. Massively magnified images of a 12-week foetus and the imputation to it of \"smiling\" and \"walking\" have had a huge impact on the climate of opinion, and are being used to shift emphasis away from the woman to the foetus. Yet the pictures add nothing to medical knowledge nor have there been any other significant technological changes to justify the pressure for change that has been created in response to them. </p> <p>The time limit for abortion is currently 24 weeks, a compromise that balances the needs and rights of women with the understanding that as pregnancy progresses the foetus approaches personhood. In doing so, it reflects that our society neither accepts the absolutist position of the anti-abortion lobby who want to ban all abortions nor, at the other extreme, the views of those who believe in a woman's right to choose at any stage of pregnancy. The pre-25 week foetus, as the Panorama programme Miracle Baby Grows Up demonstrated last month, has very little chance of surviving. In Holland, babies born before 25 weeks are not resuscitated, and it has been suggested that the same policy be introduced here. </p> <p>In 2003, fewer than 1.6% of abortions took place after 22 weeks, which shows just how unusual it is for women to have a late abortion. These are women who have very particular needs: those who decide to terminate a wanted pregnancy because of a foetal abnormality or because their personal circumstances have changed significantly; those who have irregular periods, including the very young or menopausal, and have only just realised they are pregnant; those who go into denial - again these are often the very young; and refugees or asylum seekers, who are unfamiliar with services and contending with many other difficulties. A reduced time limit would force such vulnerable women to continue with their pregnancies against their will. </p> <p>Women who have late abortions for foetal abnormality are treated differently from others who present late. The former are looked after within foetal medicine services, but not the latter. There is a shortage of doctors with the skill to perform late abortions, so it would be logical for all these abortions to be provided within foetal medicine services, especially as the latter group often find it hard to get an abortion at all. </p> <p>The gestation at which an abortion is considered \"late\" varies: in some parts of the country, it is after 12 weeks, in others, 18 or 20. Our helpline regularly takes calls from distraught women who are within the time limit but who have been refused as being \"too late\". These women meet the law's criteria, and are entitled to an abortion. They desperately need a service that will respond to them promptly and with compassion, not one that compounds their difficulties. </p> <p>The current focus on late abortion means that the real issues that women face are hardly being discussed. In 2003, 181,600 women in England and Wales had abortions, 87% of these before 13 weeks. One in five pregnancies ends in abortion and it is estimated that two out of five women will have an abortion. Abortion services are a basic health service, yet they are characterised by inequity, delay and lack of priority. </p> <p>There is a considerable variation in funding of NHS abortion across the country, from a high of over 90% to a low of just 46%. Some areas with the worst NHS provision argue that local women are affluent and prefer to pay, yet this \"choice\" may really be motivated by long waiting times. </p> <p>The greatest inequity in the UK is Northern Ireland, which is not covered by the 1967 Abortion Act. Abortion is legal there, but more restricted than the rest of the UK. As a result, about 2,000 women travel to Britain every year to pay for their abortion. In 2002, fpa mounted a legal challenge in the high court in Belfast ,and the appeal court has recently ruled that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has actively sought to avoid its responsibilities regarding abortion and ought to issue guidance. This ruling has had little coverage in the British media but is of great significance to a great many women in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>It is clearly best for women to have their abortion as soon as possible. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) guidelines say there should be no more than a three-week wait from initial referral to the procedure, but fpa recommends a 72-hour target, with one week as a maximum. However, many areas are far from achieving the RCOG standard. </p> <p> Some of the 13% of women who have their abortions after 12 weeks do so because of delays in getting a referral at all, or long waiting times for the abortion itself. Women should not be subject to the terrible distress of waiting for five, six or seven weeks at an already fraught time. </p> <p>The number of abortions carried out before 10 weeks' gestation varies from 10% to nearly 80% across the country. These figures are particularly important because at this stage less invasive methods such as medical abortion (using drugs) and early surgical abortion under local anaesthetic or conscious sedation are particularly appropriate. Not all women are offered these choices and medical abortion accounted for only about 17% of the total number of abortions in 2003. In addition, a very high number of abortions are performed under general anaesthetic compared with other countries. </p> <p>These methods have enormous potential for providing modern, caring, locally-based nurse-led abortion services for women. Our current laws make this impossible because two doctors have to agree to the abortion, it has to be carried out in an NHS hospital or licensed premises and only a registered medical practitioner can perform an abortion. The law needs to be changed so that appropriately trained nurses can carry out early medical and surgical abortions, and do so in general practice or community clinics. </p> <p>In the United States over 200,000 women have had early medical abortions, going to a doctor or clinic for the first drug, which interrupts the pregnancy, and two days later using the second drug, which completes the process, at home. This option is not currently available to women in this country although there does not appear to be any legal reason to deny women this choice. </p> <p>No method of contraception is perfect and human beings are fallible, so abortion services will always remain an essential feature of sexual health services. The challenge is to ensure that services are high quality, woman-centred and fit for the 21st century. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Anne Weyman in chief executive of fpa, formerly the Family Planning Association </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:library&amp;information@fpa.org.uk\">library&amp;information@fpa.org.uk</a></p>",

There is no return from this.\"</p> <p>Four cabinet ministers, including Mr Sharon's arch-rival Binyamin Netanyahu, who voted in favour, none the less threatened to resign in a fortnight unless the prime minister agreed to a national referendum on the plan.</p> <p>The small National Religious party also threatened to walk out of the government if there was not a plebiscite.</p> <p>But Mr Sharon continued to resist the pressure, saying that a referendum would delay the withdrawal by a year.</p> <p>After the vote, the prime minister swiftly carried out his threat to sack any cabinet ministers voting against disengagement by dismissing Uzi Landau, the leader of the ruling party's rebels in parliament.</p> <p>Mr Sharon's aides predicted that opposition within his party and government to the plan may force him to put together a new ruling coalition or call early elections.</p> <p>Speaking to parliament on Monday, Mr Sharon broke with his core constituency among the settlers and right-wing Israelis when he called the vote a \"fateful moment for Israel\".</p> <p>The withdrawal plan removes only about 8,000 settlers, the bulk living in the Gaza strip. About 420,000 Jews will remain in Israel's West Bank colonies and east Jerusalem, occupied in 1967.</p> <p>But the leader of the Labour opposition, Shimon Peres, threw his party's weight behind the plan because he said it was a historic opportunity that would create momentum toward a resolution of the Palestinian conflict.</p> <p>\"This is a historic vote that will put the country back on to the right course. Once we return it will be hard to reverse it,\" he said.</p> <p>Palestinian officials remain deeply suspicious of the plan, saying the withdrawal from Gaza is designed to shield an expansion of Israeli control in the West Bank.</p> <p>Nearly half of Likud's MPs, led by Mr Landau, voted against the disengagement process last night. \"Unilateral withdrawal is simply signalling to the Palestinians that terrorism rewards and that Israel is in an ongoing retreat.</p> <p>\"This is not going to reduce terrorism, it is going to boost it,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We see all these territories as our homeland. For many of us it's as though they are encroaching on our very right to be there, but also it casts a shadow on our ability to really defend ourselves.</p> <p>\"There are many, many Arabs who hate our guts and want our destruction. We don't want to see an additional terrorist state on our border.\"</p> <p>Some opponents have accused Mr Sharon of \"caving in to terrorism\" and of being a traitor because he is considered the godfather of the settlements and oversaw the massive expansion of Israel's West Bank and Gaza colonies during the 70s and 80s.</p> <p>But the latest opinion poll, in the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, shows overwhelming public support for the withdrawal, with 65% of Israelis in favour and 26% opposed.</p> <p>Several thousand settlers and their supporters rallied outside parliament, but there were far fewer protesters than the organisers predicted.</p> <p>Jonathon Patinkin, from Beit El settlement in the West Bank, headed three generations of his family at the protest.</p> <p>\"This is a battle. We haven't lost the war yet,\" he said. \"If it goes on we will lose all the settlements. It is only the first step in a domino effect. Even Jerusalem is at risk.\"</p> <p>The protesters waved signs saying, \"Settlements equal security, disengagement equals transfer\" and \"Soldiers, disobey orders to evacuate us\".</p> <p>Some of the more vitriolic slogans of previous rallies calling Mr Sharon a Nazi were missing after the police warned they would not permit such incitement at a time when Israel was remembering the ninth anniversary of the assassination of its former prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin.</p> <p>In Gaza, Hamas hailed the vote as a victory for Palestinian resistance.</p> <p>\"The approval today of the Sharon plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip is a big achievement of the Palestinian people and the resistance, which alone has pushed the Zionist enemy to think of leaving Gaza,\" said the group's spokesman, Mushir al Masri.</p> <p>The cabinet still has to approve four stages of the withdrawal from Gaza.</p>",
  "There were calls yesterday to clarify the law after a judge said it was \"a pity\" charges were considered against a farmer who shot a burglar. <p>At the burglar's trial, Derby crown court heard how John Rae, 22, targeted 73-year-old Kenneth Faulkner's isolated house at Ockbrook, Derbyshire, three times last year before the latter fired a shotgun at him. </p> <p>Prosecutor Michael Auty told Judge Andrew Hamilton that charges against Mr Faulkner had been considered but not brought, since his intention was to frighten; there was no evidence to suggest \"anything other than acting in legitimate defence of his property and person\". In addition, Rae had suffered only pellet wounds to his lower leg. </p> <p>With Rae admitting the offence and others, the judge described him as \"an absolute menace\" and sentenced him to seven years in jail. </p> <p>The case contrasted with the prosecution of another farmer, Tony Martin, jailed for manslaughter. The law entitles householders to \"reasonable force\", and no more. Mr Martin exceeded this, since the jury accepted the prosecution case that he shot his intruder in the back as he was leaving. </p> <p>Yesterday there were calls for clearer guidelines. Victim Support spokesman Andrew Buckingham said: \"The Home Office itself says there is a lot of confusion. When there is confusion to what reasonable force is, coupled with residents' anger at being targeted, it makes for a very complex set of circumstances.\" </p> <p>Courts make allowances for fear and the need to act in the heat of the moment. There have been cases of resulting serious injury or even death considered reasonable, in the face of a severe threat to life.</p>",
  "<p>Adults who smoke and drink heavily might be seeing more of their dentists. So might children exposed to the temptations of fizzy drinks. </p> <p>But healthy-eating people might have two-year gaps between routine checkups under the long-expected end for the NHS's six-monthly check for everyone, which was announced yesterday. </p> <p>The change, hailed as the end of a \"one size fits all\" service and the dawn of an era of personalised care aimed at disease prevention, was confirmed by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. </p> <p>Under-18s will be seen at three-, six-, nine- or 12-monthly intervals according to the state of their teeth and mouths, while the gap for older patients will vary between three and 24 months. </p> <p>But as the Liberal Democrats pointed out, it was not clear what impact this might have for people who had no access to NHS dentists. </p> <p>The government has promised 1,000 extra NHS dentists, through overseas recruitment and more money.</p>",
  "<p>Beware of being misled by the success of the first generation of girls to have beaten boys in all key exam stages at school and university. On some fronts they have generated a genuine \"gender-quake\" in key professions that were once dominated by men. More women than men are now being recruited to the fast-track senior civil service promotion programme, as well as in law and medicine. Indeed the latest recruitment figures for these letter professions are startling, with female trainee solicitors and female medical students outnumbering their male contemporaries by almost two to one. But these specific successes should not be mistaken for a more general trend. As a well-researched pamphlet published yesterday by the Equal Opportunities Commission documents, women still suffer serious discrimination at work almost 30 years after the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act and their hourly pay is nearly 20% less than men's 34 years after the 1970 Equal Pay Act. </p> <p>What has gone wrong? At a Downing Street summit on gender and productivity yesterday, three key causes were identified: occupational segregation that locks large numbers of women into low-paid work and locks many more out of better paid jobs; straight discrimination; and the continuing difficulty of combining work with caring responsibilities. Segregation begins in school where girls are still given too little encouragement to try non-traditional work; but employers need a change of attitude too. One driver of reform is the skills shortage facing some of the most male-dominated and better-paid sectors - plumbing, engineering, construction. Tentative moves have begun, but bolder initiatives are needed. About one in five women who return to the same employer after maternity leave come back to a lower grade. Ministers have recognised the need to make affordable and universal childcare a new frontier for the welfare state, but it will take years to put in place. </p> <p>Gordon Brown conceded yesterday that too many governments - \"including Labour governments\" - had kept female equality on the fringe. He acknowledged women workers could play a central role in solving Britain's skills shortage. Now all we need is action. This should start with a more appropriate curriculum and better career guidance for girls at school; it could go on to require companies to carry out pay audits and, like Norway, to insist on the appointment of more women directors on corporate boards; and then to overhaul the current discrimination law so that it is simpler and easier to apply.</p>",

  "Don't say \"professionalisation\", insists the cabinet secretary sternly. Civil servants are already professionals, but, Sir Andrew Turnbull argues, they never thought it necessary to put a framed certificate on the wall, saying MBA, or member of the Institute of Bankers, or whatever. <p>\"Professionalism is not the exclusive preserve of those disciplines where it is possible to earn letters after one's name,\" says Turnbull, who seems determined to leave as one of his memorials long-lasting changes in the Whitehall skill set. (It is widely assumed, though he won't say, that he would retire next September, provided the general election is held in May.)</p> <p>At a think-in for several hundred officials at a London hotel last week, he unveiled a new scheme. Drafted by a committee led by Sir Richard Mottram, permanent secretary in the Department for Work and Pensions, it involves reskilling the entire civil service. Turnbull does not demur when you prompt him with phrases such as accreditation revolution - though it will take years to work through the system.</p> <p>In future, civil servants must pass through \"gateways\" before setting foot on the next rung of the career ladder. They will have to show they can deliver services and master such corporate skills as finance, statistics and human relations. These gateways will loom at the point of entry to the senior civil service, and again on admission to departmental boards. The gateways will coexist with separate ladders of advancement for specialist accountants, lawyers and scientists.</p> <p>As a result, the terrain of competence in Whitehall is being mapped. Anne Gregory, president of the Institute of Public Relations, has been brought in to review how government press officers are trained. Operational delivery (what big outfits such as the Inland Revenue do) has been given its own \"head of profession\". He is Ian Magee, a social security wizard who is now chief executive for operations (mainly the courts) in the Department for Constitutional Affairs.</p> <p>There will not be specific numbers for staff who have to train in finance, the law, statistics or other specialisms; nor will the Cabinet Office be laying down curricula. Turnbull presents the change as a more gradual move to boost the stock of professional skills for government. \"It's another brick in the edifice of modernisation,\" he says.</p> <p>There is another, intriguing new title that Turnbull has just dispensed. He has created the job of head of profession for policy, to be filled by Sir Brian Bender, permanent secretary at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and formerly in the Cabinet Office. This is an altogether new departure, policy never before having been recognised as a separate territory.</p> <p>The thinking here is both positive and negative. It is about time Whitehall stood up and extolled its own \"traditional\" skill set, including providing ministers with advice. Our own fault, says Turnbull. The skills and leadership needed to negotiate an international treaty or to write then shepherd a piece of legislation through parliament have lacked \"parity of esteem\" with operational and delivery skills.</p> <p>Those older qualities are to be revalidated. To get to the top, civil servants will need to be good at \"political management\", working with ministers and policy advice. No, he does not think that young civil servants should have a master's degree in public administration. But he adds: \"We need to make clear that managing the processes of government, preparing a policy document, delivering public accountability through parliamentary questions and correspondence all require as much professionalism as drawing up the resource accounts or providing scientific advice.\"</p> <p>Turnbull is evidently fed up with outside attacks on \"the generalist culture\". A key document in the debate is a committee of inquiry into the civil service set up 36 years ago by Labour prime minister Harold Wilson and chaired by university vice-chancellor John Fulton. It lambasted Whitehall arrogance and amateurism and did lead to the abolition of the class distinctions that had kept clerks away from the \"first division\". The union for senior civil servants still calls itself the First Division Association.</p> <p>Turnbull says the Fulton inquiry failed because the reformers of the late 1960s \"overplayed their hand\". Change has, instead, to be internally generated.</p> <p>So the civil servant of the future will be neither a generalist nor a specialist. The labels have dogged Whitehall for years. \"One too easily morphs into the Fulton tag of the gifted amateur, drifting rapidly and superficially from one subject to another,\" Turnbull says. \"The specialist tag has too often contributed to a sense of isolation.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Walker edits Public, the Guardian's magazine for public executives.

  "<p>Illegal fly-tipping is so widespread that organised crime is moving in to the market to make quick profits, the Environment Agency warned yesterday. </p> <p>Revealing plans for a \u00a319m law enforcement programme, the agency's chief executive, Lady Young, called for more effective sentences for those convicted of dumping hazardous waste. </p> <p>Increases in landfill taxes and a reduction in the number of legitimate sites were fuelling rapid expansion in the black market for clandestine rubbish disposal, which was even being exploited by mainstream building contractors, she said. </p> <p>Last year there were more than 5,000 serious cases of illegal dumping. </p> <p>Speaking at the Environment Agency's annual conference in Birmingham, Lady Young said: \"As the cost of landfill goes up, we want magistrates to be more aware of environmental crime. We want to have more flexible punishments - for example, community service orders for firms that do not get their act together.\" </p> <p>One home counties police force is examining whether it can use anti-social behaviour orders against persistent fly-tippers. </p> <p>The agency has submitted a bid for \u00a319m over four years to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The money would be used to recruit more staff to catch fly-tippers, support local authorities which pursue prosecutions, coordinate intelligence about illegal operators and establish a register of legitimate rubbish disposal firms. </p> <p>Martin Brocklehurst, the head of waste strategy at the Environment Agency, said that while the average fine was \u00a32,500, small illegal operators could make \u00a3100,000 a year from fly-tipping.</p>",
  "<p>Almost half of the world lives on less than $2 (\u00a31.10) a day. For each dollar the west gives in aid to developing countries, it takes back $2. The United Nations estimates that third world nations are denied about $700bn annually because of unjust trade rules. Meanwhile, rich countries, with only 15% of the world's population, generate half of the world's carbon dioxide emissions and use half of the world's energy. </p> <p>That is the bad news. The good news is that it is possible to do something about it. </p> <p>1. The way you spend your money can change lives. Martin Luther King said: \"Before you finish eating breakfast this morning, you've depended on more than half the world.\" So, wake up and smell the fair trade coffee. Fair trade bucks the free market to give a bigger share of profits to producers. Small producers in developing countries receive a guaranteed price, including a small social premium, to help them survive in a global trading system where the odds are stacked against them. The Fairtrade Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.fairtrade.org.uk\">www.fairtrade.org.uk</a>) labels more than 250 products, and sales are now about \u00a3100m a year. </p> <p>2. Your wallet can be a powerful weapon in the war against inequality. Sales of ethical goods and services in Britain stand at about \u00a37bn, according to the Co-operative Bank (<a href=\"http://www.co-operativebank.co.uk\">www.co-operativebank.co.uk</a>), and more than half of shoppers now switch brands or boycott a product for ethical reasons. </p> <p>3. Join the growing number of consumers calling on multinational corporations to be more responsible. Let them know why you are unhappy with them so they can correct what they are doing wrong. </p> <p>4. Having given your spending cash a conscience, make sure you do the same with savings. If you do not like tobacco companies' attempts to boost cigarette sales in developing countries, or oil and armament companies' practices, you may be surprised to find that your money could be funding these activities. Your cash in a bank, pension fund or an endowment may have been invested in firms involved in activities you abhor. Find out about your workplace pension fund's investments, and if you disagree about where the money is going, lobby for change. The fund's trustees are legally obliged to tell members about their policy on socially responsible investment. The Ethical Investment Research Service (<a href=\"http://www.eiris.org\">www.eiris.org</a>) is a good source of information. </p> <p>5. If you want to put your savings to work for positive change, switch your account to the Co-op Bank. Also check out Triodos Bank (<a href=\"http://www.triodos.co.uk\">www.triodos.co.uk</a>) and Charity Bank (<a href=\"http://www.charitybank.org\">www.charitybank.org</a>). Here the accent is more on the feelgood factor than the financial return. </p> <p>6. This is Energy Savings Week, so try switching to renewable energy for your electricity supply. It's simple and not a lot more expensive to transfer. The more demand there is for energy from renewable sources such as wind farms, the more supply will be generated. Friends of the Earth (<a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk\">www.foe.co.uk</a>) has a list of recommended suppliers. </p> <p>7. Switch to energy-saving light bulbs. They cost more than ordinary bulbs, but last longer. According to the Energy Saving Trust (<a href=\"http://www.est.org.uk\">www.est.org.uk</a>), if every home in the UK replaced three bulbs with energy-efficient ones, it would save enough energy to power all the streetlights in the country - saving money and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>8. A shower uses 40% of the hot water needed for a bath, and you save on energy too. A Hippo in your lavatory cistern can save up to three litres of water per flush - about 5,500 litres a year. Look for water saving ideas at Thames Water (<a href=\"http://www.thameswater.co.uk\">www.thameswater.co.uk</a>) </p> <p>9. Donate money to help the billion or more people around the world who do not have access to clean water and the 2 billion-plus who have no proper sanitation. A cash donation to Water Aid (<a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org\">www.wateraid.org</a>) will assist its efforts to get water, sanitation and hygiene education to some of the poorest people in the world. </p> <p>10. Each household in Britain produces more than a tonne of waste annually. About 80% ends up in landfill sites, but up to three-quarters of it could be recycled or composted. Wastewatch (<a href=\"http://www.wastewatch.org.uk\">www.wastewatch.org.uk</a>) promotes and encourages action on the three Rs - reduction, reuse and recycling. </p> <p>11. Buy recycled products where possible. As demand for recycled products increases, more waste can be recycled. On top of that, recycled paper production, for example, uses only about half the energy needed to make virgin paper. Recycling specialist Remarkable (<a href=\"http://www.remarkable.co.uk\">www.remarkable.co.uk</a>) produces an interesting range of environmentally friendly stationery. </p> <p>12. Tourism can be a force for good, providing employment in poor countries, but it can also be immensely destructive. Aircraft are a rapidly increasing source of greenhouse gas emissions. For trips closer to home, the train is a far more environmentally friendly way of getting around. If you must fly, consider giving a small donation to a local transport group or environmental advocacy organisation. Tourism Concern (<a href=\"http://www.tourismconcern.org.uk\">www.tourismconcern.org.uk</a>) has pioneered the concept of ethical tourism, raising awareness of the effects holidays can have on communities, economies and the environment. If everybody does a little, it could help to change a lot. And, as the proverb says: \"If you think you're too small to make a difference, you haven't been in bed with a mosquito.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Pushpinder Khaneka is the author of Do the Right Things!

  "<p>Woking Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) deals with 17,000 problems each year, and offers free advice on issues from personal relationships and debt to benefits and employment.</p> <p>Welfare benefits are its biggest single area of advice, and some 10% of enquiries are related to housing benefits. People might visit a CAB to get help filling out claims forms if they can't pay their rent - perhaps because they haven't received their housing benefit - or if they want to check on the status of their claim.</p> <p>A web-based system that gives CAB staff access to Woking borough council's benefit records now means that many of these enquiries can be solved on the spot - without having to phone or write to the council for more information.</p> <p>Indeed, in one case of disputed housing benefit arrears, having access to local authority information about dates of claims meant the bureau secured an adjournment of repossession for its client, saving them from eviction by a private landlord.</p> <p>Chris Eele, CAB manager at Woking, says the system helps bureau staff to solve client queries quickly and efficiently, and saves valuable time and resources for the council.</p> <p>\"We deal with many people who are 'chaotic' - they may have mental health problems or be fleeing from domestic violence,\" Eele says. Typically, they don't have their papers to hand, they don't know what they have told the council and they struggle with the bureaucracy of government.</p> <p>\"We can use local authority information to establish a coherent picture of their housing benefit entitlement. This in turn helps the council, because such clients require face-to-face interaction and so are expensive to deal with.\"</p> <p>The cooperation between Woking CAB and its local council is one example of where the Citizens Advice service is positioning itself as an intermediary for e-government. It sees itself as playing an invaluable role serving people who wouldn't usually have access to e-government.</p> <p>\"Eighty per cent of our clients don't have internet access,\" says Malcolm Taylor, e-government project manager at Citizens Advice, the national organisation for 2,000 CAB outlets across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. \"The government has long recognised that it needs intermediaries like us if it is going to reach these people.\"</p> <p>In 2002, Citizens Advice secured \u00a320m from the Department of Trade and Industry to help modernise its IT infrastructure and fulfil its role as a \"bridge\" to electronic services. The Citizens Connect programme has two main technology components: to connect all bureaux with a virtual private network, and to introduce a national case management system for advisers to record and share client information. Nearly all bureaux are connected with the network, says Taylor, and most are using the client-management system.</p> <p>The national charity is now seeking to establish links with central and local government (see box) to fulfil its intermediary role and to influence the development of electronic services. It has criticised government bodies for box-ticking to meet the 2005 e-government targets instead of producing services that are truly useful.</p> <p>However, Citizens Advice has had some successes at a local level thanks to strong existing links between councils and their local bureaux.</p> <p>In Exeter, a good relationship resulted in the local bureau gaining web-based access to the city council's housing benefit and council tax records. Exeter CAB says that, although it has been a tough for its 65 staff to understand the council's system (they can't customise the view for their own purposes), the overwhelming results have been positive.</p> <p>\"Previously, staff had real problems getting through to the housing benefit department at the council,\" says Matthew Brown, CAB manager at Exeter. \"Even if they did get through, it might take hours or days to resolve the query, depending on its complexity. Now we ring a dedicated number for a secure access code and access the information ourselves. Our staff have found it a much better way of working - plus it allows us to see more clients and better meet the huge demand for our services.\"</p> <p>Uttlesford district council in Essex has secure funding from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for a joint project with its local CAB to introduce a similar system - and other local authorities are likely to follow suit, says Taylor. \"The technology is relatively simple to set up,\" he says. \"The challenge is getting agreement between the local authority and the bureau around data-sharing protocols and ways of working.\"</p> <p>In Woking, the CAB had to agree procedures to verify the identity of clients, to gain secure read-only access to the council's systems and to get consent from clients to act on their behalf and to access their information.</p> <p>\"Local government can see that this is a quick win for them and for the local population,\" says Eele. \"The potential is huge. It would be great for us to have access to other Woking borough council systems, such as those used for community care and housing management. We are currently discussing other areas of possible collaboration.\"</p> <p><strong>How is Citizens Advice linking with government?</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Citizens Advice has run internet kiosk trials in bureaux waiting rooms at seven sites. These showed that one in five people who used a kiosk didn't then need to see a bureau adviser. Use of kiosks had to be facilitated by members of bureau staff to be effective. Citizens Advice is now running further kiosk trials at another eight sites and reckons that around 30% of bureaux will be suitable for this technology, particularly in busy city locations where kiosks help to reduce pressure on waiting rooms.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The national CAB organisation is on the board of the ODPM-funded National Benefits Project. This makes it easier for citizens to determine their eligibility for benefits. Two bureaux in Liverpool and one in Rotherham are involved in the housing benefits stream of the project. They hope to calculate entitlement to housing benefit on behalf of clients and to track the progress of claims online. A survey revealed the ability to track claims was a difficulty, so the national CAB organisation has agreed data-sharing protocols with Liverpool and Rotherham councils.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Citizens Advice is working on a six-month \"intermediaries\" project with the Department for Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue to assess the viability of sharing data about benefits and tax credits. This is in its early stages and is having mixed success. \"It is likely that the Inland Revenue will allow us access to tax credits information in some way, shape or form,\" says Taylor. \"But challenges remain with the DWP - not least because it is struggling to cope with its own rather antiquated IT systems.\"</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>Canadian government portal: <br><a href=\"http://www.canada.ca\">www.canada.ca</a></p> <p>Community portal of Coquitlam and Port Moody: <br><a href=\"http://www.citysoup.ca/yahoo \">www.citysoup.ca/yahoo </a></p> <p>Woking Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB): <br><a href=\"http://www.wokingcab.org.uk\">www.wokingcab.org.uk</a></p> <p>Woking borough council: <br><a href=\"http://www.woking.gov.uk\">www.woking.gov.uk</a></p> <p>Citizens Advice: <br><a href=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk\">www.citizensadvice.org.uk</a></p> <p>Exeter CAB: <br><a href=\"http://www.exetercab.org.uk\">www.exetercab.org.uk</a></p> <p>National Benefits Project: <br><a href=\"http://www.ebenefits.org.uk\">www.ebenefits.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Since September 1, every computer- related glitch in British public life has been Ian Watmore's fault. The government's new chief information officer says that, unlike his predecessor the e-Envoy, he has a mandate to look at IT throughout the public sector, including in local authorities.</p> <p>\"The government sees my role as a wider public sector role, not as a central government one, and I want to work actively and cooperatively with local government,\" he says. </p> <p>Watmore's arrival marks several big changes for the Cabinet Office's e-team, based near Victoria station in London. As the Office of the e-Envoy, its main job was getting Britons to use the internet. Its e-government responsibilities were monitoring progress towards the 2005 target, setting standards and running shared systems. </p> <p>Watmore's Office of the Head of e-Government inherits the e-government targets, together with responsibility for \"back office\" systems right across government. The aim is to provide the IT to underpin massive efficiency savings set out in the current public spending round.</p> <p>This is a big cultural shift for both the man and his organisation. Watmore, at 46, is new to the public sector, though he says his 23 years with Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting) gave him experience with large government IT programmes. Like his colleague Richard Granger, the NHS's IT chief, Watmore is a veteran of the gruelling process to computerise systems at the former Department of Social Security.</p> <p>Watmore cheerfully admits that local government is a new area. \"It's not an area in which I personally have a lot of background and experience, so I'm keen to listen,\" he says. Watmore adds that he has publicly recognised local government's role as an innovator. \"I've often said that local government led central government. The notion of compulsory competitive tendering started in local government in the 80s and reached Whitehall in the 90s. The first significant public sector outsourcing strategy in the world, full stop, started in UK local government,\" he says.</p> <p>The top item on Watmore's agenda is his role as a \"change agent\" in Sir Peter Gershon's efficiency review of the public sector. \"This is not a theoretical exercise - it will happen.\" He has two roles. One is to look at the way government buys and runs its IT. This involves working with the Treasury's Office of Government Commerce to turn government into a \"smart customer\" of IT.</p> <p>The other role is to support government-wide corporate services, starting with human resources and finance. While the office of e-government's role is \"still evolving\", he says that individual departments will probably continue to procure these systems. But they will be supported by Watmore's office. \"We have to find ways of supporting the process team leaders in those areas with top-class HR and financial system support,\" he says.</p> <p>This means making sure government doesn't try to step beyond what is technologically possible. \"We want to ensure that we are creating business process templates that, if people were to execute them, they would naturally find good software out there.\" </p> <p>Watmore's staff are going through their own cultural change. The office is shedding its responsibilities for closing the digital divide, now the responsibility of the Department for Education and Skills. Work on e-democracy will transfer to the Department for Constitutional Affairs. On the other hand, Watmore says he is building up skills in \"back office\" services such as human resources and payroll, identified as an early target for efficiency savings.</p> <p>Watmore is not planning to run these services, but he is determined to ensure that the software on which they depend is up to the job. \"It is an easily made mistake to over-engineer what you want and find that the software packages out there don't fit, so you either scale back your ambitions or custom-build on the core package and end up with some clunky system that doesn't deliver what you want,\" he says. </p> <p>Another priority is to increase the take up of self-service government. This was already seen as a logical part of the 2005 e-government target. It is likely to receive new attention under Watmore. \"I think the 2005 targets were fundamentally about getting a broad array of services available online,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I think what we want to do next is get that high take-up and high impact of the services that really matter and which touch people's lives.\" One example is the online filing of self-assessment tax returns. Although the number of people who file electronically is now growing, it lags well behind the rate in leading e-government countries such as Canada.</p> <p>The main engine for self-service government will continue to be the Directgov portal, Watmore says. He intends to build on the existing \"franchise\" model, where themed content for the site is provided by outside agencies. But he's in no hurry to promote the site. \"I think it's a brand that will grow over time and, as we get more franchises involved, it will go up its own maturity curve, so it will start slow and accelerate as more and more things come into the mainstream,\" Watmore says. </p> <p>\"There may be a marketing strategy, but I'm not going to invest huge dollars - I'm sorry, huge pounds - in advertising while we're still driving the concept down.\"</p> <p>But whatever the take-up of self-service government, Watmore says that for the forseeable future, many citizens will depend on contact with frontline public servants. Here, his role is to provide the best possible IT. This could be done through projects along the lines of the NHS national programme for IT, which is spending \u00a36bn on new standard systems. If any such programmes are launched, Watmore expects his office to play a key role. </p> <p>\"I think we would be part of getting such a programme understood, that people want to do it, believe in it, get the funding agreed, get the buy-in, get the leadership to run it and all the rest of it,\" he says. </p> <p>One area of e-government strategy likely to be revived by Watmore is encouraging the role of \"intermediaries\" in electronic services. The idea is to encourage voluntary organisations and private firms to offer public services to their customers. The policy is languishing because of difficulties with sharing costs and data. Watmore says the time is right to revive it.</p> <p>One example would be car insurance companies renewing tax discs. However, Watmore says he is also looking at the role of \"intermediaries\" within the public sector, along the lines of the Pensions Agency's call-centre staff.</p> <p>His plan is to encourage new ideas, and spread news of good practice. \"When we have a success, let's not go over the top, but let's at least celebrate it and try to get other people to feel confident about following that,\" he says.</p> <p>Watmore is also responsible for finding central solutions to the knottiest problems of e-government, security, authentication and privacy. Authentication will be a long slog, even if the ID card project gets under way on schedule. \"It's complicated because of the breadth of service providers, and because of the scale of the challenge - it's got to handle 60 million citizens,\" Watmore says. \"Not many companies in the world have 60 million customers, so there's not a lot of practice to pull from. Then you've got the practicality in getting from here to there.\"</p> <p>Simply issuing electronic identities to citizens will take years, if not decades, because of the cycles of renewal of existing documents such as passports and drivers' licences. On privacy and security, there are no easy answers. \"The role we have here is to sponsor that which is obviously a difficult balance between security and usability,\" Watmore says. \"It's quite a subtle balance and will be taken case by case, but I do see my role overarchingly as one of trying to get that strategic policy environment set in which people operate, and trying to get that security- privacy balance right.\"</p> <p>He will also be under pressure to resolve another emotive issue: whether the government should promote the use of open-source software. \"To be honest, I've not even looked at that yet, so I've got no comment,\" Watmore says. \"The only thing I would say is that I am a pragmatist in these things. I believe in pragmatism in these issues, and in pragmatism in getting the balance right between short- and long-term solutions on IT directions. Most importantly, IT is only enabling some more important change. Let's do the pragmatic thing, make the important change. It's more important to have better healthcare and better education than to have a theological debate about these things.\"</p> <p>It's difficult for all concerned, especially as Watmore was planning to produce his first strategic plan for e-government by the end of this month. And some of his staff have had to make their own cultural adjustments: learning to cope with his fondness for footballing metaphors for instance. Watmore is a serious Arsenal supporter.</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>Directgov portal:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk\">www.direct.gov.uk</a></p> <p>Design Council:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.designcouncil.org.uk\">www.designcouncil.org.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>Surveys often judge a council's e-government prowess on the quality of its website or call centre. But reconstructing the administrative processes behind the scenes can make just as big a difference to its performance.</p> <p>It's this \"back-office\" reconstruction that the \u00a33.4m Enterprise Workflow national project aims to boost by providing case studies and software.</p> <p>St Helen's borough council, Lancashire, is making available the performance management software it produced to improve its internal processes. This has helped it to raise its Audit Commission comprehensive performance assessment rating from \"good\" to \"excellent\".</p> <p>\"Workflow\" means automating a process by codifying who has to do what to carry it out, then using an IT system to manage that sequence. For example, it could mean replacing a paper expenses sheet with an online form that takes the details of a claim. It would electronically pass that data from the claimant to their boss for authorisation, and then remind them if they forget. It would then send it to the accounts department to generate a bank transfer without the risk of it getting lost in the internal post.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the process becomes more transparent: anyone authorised can check the system to see how far a claim has gone, how long they take on average and how much money is left in the budget.</p> <p>Phil Hope, the local e-government minister, told a project conference Enterprise Workflow is among the most important of the national projects, whose funding he oversees at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p> <p>Hope says authorities are often perceived as doing a poor job on processing council tax and housing benefits: \"Workflow can help us change that perception - by no means always deserved - for the better.\"</p> <p>Knowsley's poor reputation on processing housing benefit claims was, sadly, deserved. Three years ago, the Merseyside metropolitan borough council took an average of 148 days to process each claim. \"We've had problems with our 'revs and bens'. I'm not going to hide that,\" chief executive Steve Gallagher told the conference.</p> <p>When the council, which leads this national project, started introducing workflow, it had already reduced this to 83 days. By using the workflow functionality of already-procured software from Anite, Knowsley reduced this to 31 days, and reckons it saves \u00a3110,000 annually in processing costs.</p> <p>This relies both on moving to computerised systems, and on reorganising the revenue and benefits staff into units divided by neighbourhood. The council also now checks a randomly chosen 10% of claims, and allows partner organisations, such as housing agencies, to pass on their data electronically by scanning documents.</p> <p>Away from benefits, it has moved all bookings from paper diaries to eShop software from Onyx, for facilities ranging from function rooms to bulky refuse collection - saving an estimated \u00a3150,000 annually.</p> <p>The council is not stopping there: internal expenses claims, which took at least a month to be paid, have been computerised in one department, greatly reducing processing times.</p> <p>Changing work processes means changing people's jobs, but Gallagher says it does not mean sackings. \"Maybe jobs go, but people don't. We've tried to ensure that people don't lose out in the process.\" Instead, he says staff can be enthused to use such systems to do their jobs better.</p> <p>For example, Knowsley plans to introduce self-service software for human resources, so staff can do their own routine administration such as changing their address. This frees those currently processing such requests to do more sophisticated work, such as staff evaluation and development.</p> <p>\"It's about engaging with the right people, very often the customer and the frontline staff - those receiving and providing the service,\" he says. \"There's best practice in any organisation of the size we're working in. You've got to find it and build on it.\" </p> <p>Workflow can be used to save time and money in a wide range of areas. North Wiltshire district council estimates it will save \u00a3156,000 a year when it introduces an electronic order-invoice processing system.</p> <p>In the current system, chief executive Bob Marshall says there are 22 steps in dealing with each of the 12,000 orders and invoices handled annually, each costing between \u00a326 and \u00a352 to process. \"What's more significant is you can loop many times within the system,\" he told the conference. With the new system, the process has just 17 steps, and the chance for \"looping\" is reduced, cutting the processing cost by more than a third.</p> <p>If the whole council uses a common computer system, a process can be worked out once, then reused across the council. Sedgemoor district council has done this with debt recovery, a process used by four or five departments.</p> <p>Douglas Bamsey, corporate director for the Somerset district, says the separate departments were doing the job well enough, but it is creating a centralised debt recovery service for them all to use: \"You save three or four posts in that,\" he said. </p> <p>The council is trying to reduce its staff levels to lessen a \u00a31m annual overspend that is draining its reserves. Sedgemoor also plans to extend a computerised system used to handle planning correspondence to other departments.</p>",
  "<p>After freak storms, life can become stressful for local authorities. Violently uprooted trees can block a path, hang dangerously over someone's property or even injure a person.</p> <p>Faced with short-tempered callers and working with paper files, council staff can find it tough to pinpoint the location of any problem trees, often nagged by the thought that it might not be the council's responsibility to deal with them in the first place.</p> <p>Conserving trees and managing parks and assorted plots of land is a complex operation. Hedgerows and grassy areas often need to be cut at fixed intervals to precise lengths. This is work that requires close liaison with external contractors. Any signs of neglect can - and often do - spark heated local disputes. Hardly surprising, then, that authorities such as East Hertfordshire district council have decided to invest in a hi-tech grounds-maintenance system to help.</p> <p>\"This allows us to manage how we order work from our contractors,\" says Shirley Clark, the council's assistant director for direct and contract services. \"A lot of our grounds maintenance is pre-planned, and there is additional work that needs to be done seasonally.\"</p> <p>East Hertfordshire regularly cuts hedgerows and grass verges, and often someone complains that a stretch has been missed. But the electronic system, directly linked with contractors, is now helping to resolve any disputes.</p> <p>\"Complaint information entered on the system is instantly with our contractors. It speeds up their response time,\" Clark says. The new technology also enables East Hertfordshire's grounds-maintenance staff to track precisely the work being carried out on particular groups of trees or on certain stretches of land.</p> <p>\"You can get a random generation of work done over the last few days and target inspection resources,\" Clark says. \"It takes an old paper-based system and makes it faster. If you have had problems, it allows us to look back at it on a geographical basis, and we can see how we performed the service.\"</p> <p>The fact that grounds-maintenance work can be digitised has enabled East Hertfordshire to make information available to local councillors through its intranet.</p> <p>\"If a councillor was having a ward surgery and someone said there is a piece of land between our property and no one seems to be looking after it, the councillor is able to check online to see if East Hertfordshire is responsible for that land,\" Clark says. \"They can then arrange for officers to inspect it - and it makes them much more informed.</p> <p>\"It could be a conservation area where the grass is not cut frequently. The councillors can now interact with the citizens in a more informed way rather than keep going back to officers. It is supporting their role in local wards.\"</p> <p>Hull city council has also invested in a computerised grounds-maintenance system that monitors everything from weeding flower beds to marking sports pitches and cutting bowling greens.</p> <p>Mike McWilliams, development and support manager for Hull's park and gardens, says the system stores an easily accessible history of the restoration work carried out. This is valuable information if the council, say, receives a claim for compensation should someone fall while walking on a path it owns. The history helps to give an audited account of what work the council has done over the years on particular pathways.</p> <p>With a total of 1,183 hectares of open space to maintain, McWilliams says the new technologies give a fuller and more open picture of activities being undertaken. \"You know exactly what land you have got and what you are doing on that land,\" he says. \"It's only as good as the information you put in it. But it's making sure everyone understands the areas that have been covered. It handles a lot of repetitive work and it releases you to look at more qualitative activities such as how you want to improve a site.\"</p> <p>The system enables Hull to plot the assets it manages as overlays on the top of an Ordnance Survey map. The council can shade individual features in different colours so they can be identified quickly.</p> <p>Mark Clarke, managing director of Mayrise Systems, says ground-maintenance technologies mean that councils can be more responsive to customer queries. \"I think they can save money but it's difficult to quantify. Councils can show they are more efficient and they can get to their information quicker,\" he says. \"The systems can record the locations of trees along highways for example. A lot of authorities don't know the trees they are responsible for.\"</p> <p>The Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management has welcomed the introduction of new technologies as a way of improving grounds maintenance in the public sector. However, Alan Barber, a member of the institute's park, places and countryside executive, says the systems are not especially creative. \"The software cannot do the thinking for them.\"</p> <p>Barber adds that council grounds-maintenance staff still need to do work to show the social benefits of parks that support a diverse range of plants and wildlife. \"We need to know how public parks and green spaces benefit people in order to continue to justify higher standards of maintenance,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>East Hertfordshire district council: <br><a href=\"http://www.eastherts.gov.uk\">www.eastherts.gov.uk</a></p> <p>Hull city council: <br><a href=\"http://www.hullcc.gov.uk\">www.hullcc.gov.uk</a></p> <p>Mayrise Systems: <br><a href=\"http://www.mayrise.co.uk\">www.mayrise.co.uk</a></p> <p>Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management: <br><a href=\"http://www.ilam.co.uk\">www.ilam.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>My youngest son is studying Richard III at school. So we've been talking a lot about power - what people will do to get it and keep it. But, to be fair, Richard only murdered children in order to secure absolute power. Here in Clapham, it is surprising the lengths people will go to just to guarantee themselves a year as chair of a committee. </p> <p>Most evenings, my diary offers a clash of meetings. I choose one, grateful for a clean excuse not to attend the other. But tonight is a rare occasion when I need to be at both: a general meeting of an estate that governs itself as a tenants' management organisation (TMO); and the first meeting of the Metropolitan police safer neighbourhoods panel. I decide to show my face for the first 20 minutes of the community safety meeting, cycle up Lavender Hill, answer crucial questions at the estate meeting, and shoot back down in time for the panel to reach some conclusions. </p> <p>I'm a fan of safer neighbourhoods. At last the Met is offering to listen to local people's anxieties rather than hide behind statistics. And tonight is the first real chance to express these local opinions. It would be great to see some new faces. We know what we always hear from the activists. This time we want to tap into some new energy, new voices. Meanwhile, Dominic Busby, our star community safety coordinator, has arranged for Sergeant Neil Henson from the Met to facilitate the meeting. </p> <p>A big hall, but just five punters; two neighbourhood watchers, two staff from the local street drinkers hostel and the chair of the tenants' and residents association (TRA). Henson kicks off, undaunted. He's articulate, he has method, he even has some charisma. He starts by asking what crimes we all fear. He's offering some useful answers when Lisa, the TRA chair arrives. She sets about answering Henson's question with a litany of her usual (and often valid) complaints. Patiently, Henson pulls her back to his theme. \"But what do you personally experience?\" \"People on my estate are telling me ...\" \"No, what do you yourself worry about?\" </p> <p>I'm curious to hear Lisa's answer, but it's time to get on my bike. </p> <p>Up at the TMO general meeting, I've been asked to read out a statement about recent staff changes in the estate office. My job is to reassure worried residents - and most seem to be by the time I finish reading. </p> <p>Except for Reg. He's got a question - or rather, an accusation. He wants to know why a member of the management board made a serious allegation against him. I explain that if she did, it was as a private individual, not a member of the board. No such accusation has ever even been made. But that's not enough for Reg: \"When's she going to resign?\" </p> <p>Reg's problem is Shakespearean. When the long-serving chair resigned last year, Reg - long her No 2 - presumed his moment had come. Unfortunately, no one told Maureen. She stuck her hand up at the next board meeting and got herself elected as chair. What followed was warfare bloody enough to make the Houses of York and Lancaster blanch. </p> <p>Within weeks, board meetings had imploded into accusation and counter-accusation, readings of the rules and pettifogging counter-readings - which is when I became involved as referee. Since then, most of Reg's Lancastrians have resigned or simply absented themselves from board meetings, so business is done, but it's frequently inquorate. </p> <p>Stupidly forgetting this internecine history, I'm surprised when the heated debate between Reg and me quickly spirals out of control. I do what no councillor should ever do and lose my sang-froid. Worse, I show partisanship. \"These board members,\" I say, pointing at the Yorkists, \"work hard and I find it disgusting that some people just want to stand up here and simply make trouble.\" </p> <p>I should have known \"disgusting\" would be a mistake. The backlash from Reg's supporters is valid and I quickly change tack: \"Fine, but please argue about estate policy. At the moment, all these accusations are purely personal and that's not helping anybody.\" Most residents nod but when the chair moves the amendment to the rules reducing the quorum (the point of this meeting), Reg whips out his rule book and declares that the Yorkists have failed to circulate the text in advance. He's right. So business will continue not to be done. </p> <p>I have never before so wanted to be at a police meeting. </p> <p>I make my excuses and freewheel back down the hill. But I'm too late. This meeting has also been hijacked. Apparently, Lisa was sick of police meetings, sick of talking while nothing changes. She's not entirely incorrect, but this isn't just about her estate and her opinions. </p> <p>What she doesn't seem to have grasped is that this is all about a new method to enable more residents to tackle problems themselves. Or is that precisely what she has grasped and doesn't like? She's determined that her voice is the one that gets heard. </p> <p>Both meetings have been rendered fruitless. Once the hall clears, officers (police and council) are either catatonic or verging on despair. But I tell Busby to be grateful. At least Reg didn't come to his meeting. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jonathan Myerson writes here each month on his experiences as a Lambeth Labour councillor. Some names have been changed.</p>",
  "<p>For many, it is a region set apart from the rest of the north, let alone the rest of England; fiercely proud, often parodied, sometimes insular and over-romanticised - and suspicious of a capital 300 miles away where many still trek for work. </p> <p>Stretching across mountain, moor, national park and spectacular countryside from the Tweed to the Tees, with a dialect in its heartland that many cannot fathom - it has a distinctive heritage and culture going back to St Cuthbert, an emerging patron saint who underpinned the identity of the old Northumbrian kingdom. </p> <p>But for the rest of the country, the north-east is now popularised by the lilting, smooth-tongued, partying stereotype, in the form of the cheeky TV duo, Ant and Dec, rather than a cloth capped, brown ale swilling, chain-smoking, work-shy, sexist, cartoon character. </p> <p>Andy Capp, late of Hartlepool, is long since dead - and old political allegiances could be dying, too, on the back of continuing decline. Jobless figures might be falling around Britain, but at 6% (4.7% nationally) they are rising again in a region labelled the \"geordie nation\" by property magnate Sir John Hall when he was fighting to take over Newcastle United FC in the late 1980s. </p> <p>Old grievances of the south taking all the riches are being rekindled by Hall, a former mining surveyor, evoking the verse of a generation ago when one industry dominated the economy: \"Oh! Wor pit was laid in, and we had nowt to de . . . let's off to Newcassel: Thor's fine things te de - the toon's all astir.\" </p> <p>It is the domination of that industry that has determined the more recent history of the north-east, and its political direction. With 240,000 miners less than 100 years ago, the region's most prominent social historian, Bill Lancaster, says there's a \"racing certainty\" that anyone born in the north-east has some relation to \"carboniferous capitalism\". They might also share a sense of grievance of being marginalised by Whitehall. </p> <p>Against this background, it might be assumed that the prospect of devolution in the north-east would excite the electorate, stirring a new cultural and political renaissance. </p> <p>With varying degrees of enthusiasm, ministers are offering a form of regional government to oversee industrial and economic development, strategic planning, housing, fire and rescue services and, maybe, transport. </p> <p>Other powers could be forthcoming. A few days ago Tony Blair - often considered a devolution sceptic - came to Stockton-on-Tees, not far from his Sedgefield constituency in Durham, to underline the virtues of \"bringing government closer to the people\". What's good for Scotland, Wales, and Greater London, said the prime minister, should be appealing to the north-east as well. </p> <p>But is it? A week before counting begins in an all-postal devolution referendum, there is confusion, growing hostility between opposing camps, and plain indifference. </p> <p>Many who assumed there would be an automatic yes among the 1.9 million electors are slowly realising that regional identity does not translate easily into political expression. </p> <p>\"Sure, there's a very strong shared experience in a region dominated by single industries,\" says Lancaster, director of the centre for northern studies at Northumbria University. \"We are here because of the great northern coalfield. It's a region that has an identity based on a range of cultural factors and practices - dialect, the way you look at the past, shared history - but much of that is latent rather than manifest. It's there, people recognise it, but it doesn't necessarily prompt them into action.\" </p> <p>Like the rest of the country, the north-east appears increasingly anti-politician, with the rallying cry of no campaigners in the referendum striking a chord: \"Politicians talk, we pay.\" </p> <p>Could the north-east, then, follow the example of Wales, which overwhelmingly rejected an assembly in 1979, only to narrowly approve one by less than 1%, 18 years later on the back of New Labour's honeymoon? Today, Blair is far from popular. </p> <p>Other factors are conspiring against the yes campaign, which has mopped up most of the prominent regional personalities, from Hall to the independent mayor of Middlesbrough, Ray Mallon. </p> <p>Although the assembly's annual budget of \u00a3500m would be met by Whitehall grant, some of the \u00a325m annual running costs for a 25-member body will have to come from the council tax, or its replacement after a long-awaited revaluation in 2007: an estimated 5p a week for the average taxpayer, say ministers. </p> <p>Combine this with a messy reorganisation of local government in the two-tier counties of Northumberland and Durham, and yes campaigners face an uphill struggle. Ministers have decreed that single-tier unitary authorities, potentially more distant from the people, must go hand in glove with regional government. </p> <p>Society Guardian tested opinion in Durham, likely to be the seat of a regional assembly. The city is rich in north-east symbolism, with its magnificent Norman cathedral containing the tomb of St Cuthbert. John Tomaney, professor of regional government at Newcastle university - and chairman of the yes campaign - says Cuthbert's presence has \"endured as a symbol of the region's cultural and political identity\". </p> <p>Challenging the argument that regional government will be an artificial construct thrust on the north-east, Tomaney points to a long period of self-determination going back to the middle ages. But the destruction of Cuthbert's shrine with the dissolution of the monasteries and the removal to London of the Lindisfarne gospels, created in his honour, made the cathedral a \"metaphor for the ambiguous place of the north-east in English history\". </p> <p>While our straw poll showed some support for an assembly, respondents were worried about cost and the prospect of more politicians, although local government reform will considerably reduce the number of councillors. </p> <p>Bill, a former finance officer, had an open mind until recently. Last week he voted no: \"I looked over the border at the cost of devolution in Scotland and asked if it had done them much good.\" </p> <p>His wife, Mary, a former local government officer, was even more hostile: \"It's hard enough now working out who does what, between councils and the government, and this will just complicate things.\" </p> <p>George Hetherington, a retired music teacher and doyen of the local operatic society, was emphatic: \"It will not achieve anything.\" </p> <p>Such defeatist talk rattles Mallon, who is emerging as the most influential north-east politician. He joined the yes camp late in the day, after studying the arguments for and against. \"It's all about advocacy and influence,\" he insists. </p> <p>He says that at best, the no campaign has been disingenuous. \"They keep going on about cost and the lack of powers. They misrepresent everything. The assembly will coordinate government resources, make quangos accountable, make the north-east one.\" </p> <p>But Lancaster is not so upbeat. He says big prestige cultural projects by the Tyne obscure one reality. </p> <p>\"We have not had a cultural renaissance and we have not got a political class, like the Scots. OK, we've got the Blairs and the [Alan] Milburns, but they don't really connect with the region.\" </p> <p><strong>What the locals say</strong></p> <p><strong> Tim Healy</strong> </p> <p>Actor, born in Newcastle upon Tyne</p> <p>It's always been a bit like England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and then the geordies. I've always been proud to be a geordie. It means sticking together and seeing the good side of a situation. Until TV programmes like The Likely Lads and Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, nobody knew anything about the north-east or what geordie people were like ... the humour, optimism and toughness that makes geordies what we are. We look after each other through tough times. My home was rows of terrace houses, and football in the streets. We all used to have bonfires in our back yards every night and at the top of the street it looked like lines of beacons. I lived in one of the last areas to have gas lamps - I used to shin up them to light my cigarettes, and usually got a hiding. </p> <p>Now the docks have closed, lottery money has transformed the city. It's like Blackpool was when I was a lad - a place where you knew you'd have a good time. Newcastle just seems to want to party. </p> <p><strong> Bea Campbell</strong> </p> <p>Writer and broadcaster, born in the Borders, lives in Newcastle</p> <p>I have complicated feelings about it [regional identity]. The north is no more homogenous than the south - the south could be Eastbourne or Brixton. The idea of the north is sustainable in one very sharp sense: that it isn't the south. The south is power, wealth, the political centre, a self-absorbed and complacent locale from which the north, for good reason, feels estranged. Compared with Leeds or Manchester, what you've got is breathtaking whiteness. I've never got over that and I don't like it. If there's a strong black presence in a city, it signifies challenge and change. </p> <p>The north is a metaphor for class. I still feel the working class is the majority class; full of resilience, stamina and wit, but it also has to recover from horrible macho politics. </p> <p>The north-east has suffered from the sense that its heroism is linked with industries founded on exclusion of women and black people - mining, shipbuilding, engineering. These things in the north-east's ideology constitute the north-east. Well, excuse me! What about all the mams and school dinner ladies - the women who make the world go round? </p> <p>People probably think they're from Tyneside before they think they're English, and they love their identity. Geordies are in love with themselves. </p> <p><strong> Jack Charlton</strong> </p> <p>Football legend, born and living in Northumberland </p> <p>It's the most beautiful county in England. And I'm proud of it. I like Newcastle, I like geordies - they're always very nice people. And I like fishing. The Tyne is the best salmon river in England. </p> <p>In Northumberland, we've got a coastline that's second to none. The only thing we lack is sun - and a bit less wind. We've got more castles than anyone in the world. I'm thinking very distinctly of Northumberland. I don't live in Co Durham. I've nothing against it but this is prettier. </p> <p>I worked as a boy in the mines for seven months and my father was there for 47 years. The furthest he ever got away was to Filey [north Yorkshire seaside resort]. I don't think I would have wanted to live here if the mines were still going. But the county's developed amazingly. They've cleaned up every pit heap. It's all gone. It's all landscaped. </p> <p>I was born in Northumberland and I'll probably die in Northumberland, and it will be a pleasure to do so. </p> <p><strong> Peter Barron</strong> </p> <p>Editor, Northern Echo, born Teesside </p> <p>When people who don't know it talk about the north-east, they expect an industrial wasteland, but I think it is beautiful countryside. </p> <p>There is a lot of fragmentation but wherever people are from, what they all have in common is a fierce pride and passion, born out of the industrial heritage - and football underlines all that. There's this intense rivalry between different areas but when they talk to outsiders, they'll say, 'I'm from the north-east.' </p> <p>I'm from Teesside and my dad's a steelworker. You have these rivalries within the region ... the Mackems [people from Sunderland] and the geordies. They call people from Teesside 'Smoggies', because of the industrial smog - an almost friendly derogatory term. </p> <p>It's sad that regional pride only shines through when we're living away from the region. It's an anomaly that [here] the sense of regionalism doesn't come through. In that context, the regional assembly is trying to capture that identity. </p> <p>The other day, a big development company flew in from Dubai. It was met by five district councils, all vying for attention. There are these local authorities with internal rivalries. There isn't a regional view, which the assembly might give us. </p> <p><strong> Donna Air</strong> </p> <p>TV presenter and actor, born in Newcastle </p> <p>Coming from the north-east is something in my blood. There's an energy, a motivation and a work ethic that comes from my northern roots. I feel a strong sense of pride, which is a dominant characteristic of the area - and we all like to work hard. </p> <p>What defines the place for me is the character of the city [Newcastle] and its energy. In everything, from football to the arts, there's a lot of creativity and a real lust for life. </p> <p>I see myself as a geordie, and I'm proud to be a geordie. But I think attitudes have changed and people feel they're more of a region. </p> <p>I've never met anyone who doesn't love the geordie accent - it has a lovely rhythm and it's quite musical. But people have the stereotype of these big, lardy Viz characters, or Andy Capp, and that all Newcastle girls are really up for it. I think that's funny, and I don't get offended. Most girls I know from the north-east are up for a good time. </p> <p>It's my home and I love it. The best thing about it is the strength and energy. It made me what I am today.</p>",
  "The famously unflappable Tory prime minister Harold Macmillan used to say that \"it's all got up by the press\". This week the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, must be tempted to agree. <p>Macmillan's government was attacked ferociously for legalising betting shops in 1960 and introducing premium bonds two years earlier. Harold Wilson called the inoffensive premium bond draw \"a squalid raffle\". </p> <p>With hindsight it seems mild enough in comparison with Ms Jowell's gambling bill and the prospect of lavish super-casinos. But the past week's media rage has also exceeded the relatively gentle Macmillan era. What went wrong? </p> <p>After all, Ms Jowell is famously committed to consultation and even to pre-legislative scrutiny and thought the issue had been well-aired when her bill was finally published last Tuesday, full of earnest plans to regulate and control a burgeoning industry. </p> <p>So it had, but the media and many MPs professed themselves astonished. Ministers say they expected a \"middle-sized dog nibbling at their ankles by now, not the pack in full cry\". But with hindsight, there was always going to be trouble. </p> <p><b>Budd report</b><br> Sir Alan Budd, a former chief economic adviser at the Treasury, delivered a report on the urgent need for reform to Ms Jowell, new culture secretary, in July 2001. </p> <p>It favoured sweeping liberalisation, some of which Sir Alan himself now admits was excessive. The expression \"Las Vegas style resorts\" first started appearing in press reports. That phrase, \"Las Vegas comes to Leicester\", proved irresistible, officials now concede. </p> <p><b>Whitehall shake-up</b><br> In a bid to improve Whitehall efficiency after the 2001 election, Downing Street stripped the Home Office of a series of responsibilities to focus its work on crime fighting. One of these areas was gambling, where the Department of Culture, Media and Sport had already acquired responsibility for the Lottery. </p> <p>A relatively untried team had to respond to Budd and to Gerald Kaufman's select committee report. Three times it tightened up regulation, including the draft bill itself published in 2003. </p> <p><b>The joint select committee</b><br> All but two of the MPs and peers who examined the issues in detail had interests, personal or professional, in gambling or racing, including the chairman, Tory MP John Greenway. Officials now admit the issue was \"so boring\" that the whips could only get such people on the committee. They made 139 mainly technical suggestions, but the Daily Mail says it was rigged. </p> <p><b>Government amendments</b><br> Multi-million pound US casino operators appeared to secure a significant victory in June when the government said it would allow lucrative Category A slot machines into Britain's 30-40 new regional casinos. </p> <p>They were originally to be limited to three or four of the so called resort casinos. It also raised the minimum casino floor space which would mean fewer super-casinos. </p> <p>No 10 denies favouring overseas giants, such as MGM Mirage and Caesars, which dominate the US market. The maximum cap of 40 also meant the industry stepped up its planning. </p> <p><b>That photo</b><br> One of the most compelling images of the Daily Mail's \"Kill the Casino Bill\" campaign has been a picture of a grinning Ms Jowell posing as a croupier in a London casino. The picture, taken at London's Gala Casino in March 2002 on the day the government's gambling white paper was published, was seen at the time as the perfect opportunity to illustrate the reforms. \"For most people gambling is a small but pleasurable part of their lives. Why should we stop it?\" she asked. </p> <p>Ms Jowell knows it was a mistake. </p> <p><b>Blair's eye off the ball</b><br> Blair supporters admit that No 10 has been wrong-footed. He wants to concentrate on the domestic agenda, but is still absorbed by Iraq. The long pre-legislative scrutiny process, which worked for the communications bill, made No 10 think the legislation would not cause problems. </p> <p><b>Jowell's absence</b><br> The culture secretary was involved in a family bereavement last week and into this week. David Hill, the No 10 communications director, was on holiday. Downing St was slow to respond to the media tsunami. </p> <p><b>Procedural change</b><br> Parliamentary rules now allow bills like this one to be \"rolled over\" into a new session. So rather than waste MPs time while they await the hunting bill, Peter Hain, the leader of the Commons, thought it would be a good idea to introduce the gambling bill for its second reading next Monday instead of putting it in the November 23 Queen's speech. That brought the row forward. </p> <p><b>The Dacre factor</b><br> The Daily Mail's editor has devoted pages every day to its \"kill the bill\" campaign. It also used the complaints of Britain's bookies, small arcades and casinos against US rivals to wrap the row in the flag. </p> <p><b>Opportunism in election year</b><br> Ministers thought MPs favoured their bill which they insist would clean up a fast-deregulating globalised industry and protect children. Last night the Lib Dems said they would vote against on second reading, hoping to tighten planning restrictions. So did the Tories who now want fewer casinos, on out-of-town sites.</p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago I visited a friend and, during a mini-tour of his house, I noticed in his bedroom the same make of baseball bat as that which sits under my bed. Something told me that it wasn't there to satisfy a sudden urge to play softball. Sure enough, he had bought it, as I had mine, after suffering one too many burglaries. On a humid airless evening last summer, he had left open the window of his two-year-old daughter's first-floor bedroom. The burglar climbed over her to get in. He also left a carving knife in the garden. </p> <p>When my friend told me this, my first thought was: how could he have been so naive or slack as to leave the window open? In other words, my initial instinct was to blame him. For that's what we do with the burgled - we blame the victim. </p> <p>I did the same to myself when I was burgled. Nor did the police show any sympathy. Why hadn't I double-locked the door? Why hadn't I installed extra window locks? It's a relentless logic that leads you eventually to wondering how someone could do the most natural thing in the world, like open a window on a hot summer's night. </p> <p>The point is that most of us have become so adjusted to the threat of burglary that we feel it's irresponsible not to take all possible precautions to prevent it, including leaving one's child to swelter in an unventilated room. Burglars are like the weather, we reason: we can't stop them, we can only shut them out. </p> <p>The thinking may be perverse, but it does produce results. If we're not sure about the efficacy of imprisoning burglars, we can sure see the benefits of imprisoning ourselves. Nowadays 82% of households have window locks (but only 33% of burgled properties). As a consequence, domestic burglaries have fallen by around half in the past nine years, to just over half a million a year, not counting another 400,000 attempted burglaries. </p> <p>Sadly, one of the half-million burglaries this year was at the home of Robert Symons, a teacher in west London. A court will decide what happened during that break-in last week, but what we know for certain is that Mr Symons was stabbed and he died. </p> <p>In truth, liberal society has no more idea how to respond to the murder of someone like Mr Symons than it knows what to think of Kenneth Faulkner, the 73-year farmer who earlier this week was defended by a judge for shooting a burglar on his isolated property. </p> <p>With Mr Symons, a kind of resigned shrug of \"these things unfortunately happen in a society obsessed with material status\" seems to be the unstated reaction. And with Mr Faulkner, as with Tony Martin before him, there is a half-articulated sense that burglars need protection from these people. After all, anyone who fires a gun must be a madman. </p> <p>If so, it's a madness that it would be ignorant to dismiss as a product of reactionary country folk - not least because it's a madness from which urbanites like my friend and I partially suffer. A baseball bat may not be a shotgun, but if used as a weapon it could kill someone, or certainly do them serious damage. And as with all weapons, there's no point threatening to use one unless you are prepared to. </p> <p>While I'm willing to admit that the baseball bat does not represent my sanest self, I'm not sure how to be rational with an intruder in my house at five in the morning. I once had one hide behind my sitting room door and wait until I had returned to bed before he emptied the house and took the car. I figured afterwards, in the cold light of day, that anyone who was prepared to do that would probably not comply with a polite request to leave. Hence the bat. </p> <p>Both the Symons and Faulkner incidents refer to a threat, real and perceived, that is causing us to retreat further not only into our increasingly protected homes but also into an increasingly embattled mindset. For all the locks and window grilles in the world will not make us feel safer but, on the contrary, under greater siege. The more you protect your home, the more aware you are of the threat from outside. </p> <p>The left's answer to this fear is pretty much: get over it. As someone wrote in this paper last year: \"It's unpleasant to have your space invaded; it's grim when they make a mess; it's a bummer if you're not insured; but it's only stuff ... And this is all pretty cool. It's when people stop worrying about their videos that revolutions start.\" </p> <p>There isn't space to do justice to the misconceptions contained in that paragraph, but it's safe to assume that they stem from the conviction that burglary is a simple function of poverty. In this view, burglars themselves are victims who are merely redistributing the unfair allocation of wealth. </p> <p>The problem is that it's the poor, and not the wealthy, who are the main victims of burglary, in particular the single-parent poor. And it's not stuff, but people (especially children) about which most householders worry. Just because the Daily Mail thinks burglary is wrong doesn't make it right. </p> <p>I can't pretend to know why Mr Symons got out of bed on the night he died, but I do know that he had children, and my guess is that in a choice between losing his life and his video, he would have preferred to keep his life. But the error in this line of thinking is to see burglary as purely a crime against property. </p> <p>As most people will tell you who have been burgled, it's also a crime against the person, an attack on his or her sense of security and wellbeing, which are, let's face it, basic needs common to all humans. </p> <p>For the sake of argument, imagine that you left your door open with a notice on it reading \"No resistance offered to burglars\". Well, you'd have to believe that the burglar would only be interested in your property. Of course, most burglars are after nothing else, but you'd still be giving the benefit of your doubt to someone who breaks into strangers' houses at 5am. </p> <p>So it's easy to see why people prefer instead to give the benefit of their hard-earned cash to the locksmith. Still, that said, entrenchment cannot be the healthy answer. All of us need to feel free to have the breeze blow in on a hot night. And as things stand, too many of us no longer enjoy that liberty. </p> <p>In the long term, legalising and controlling drug use may help bring down burglary, which is often fuelled by the need to buy drugs. No doubt improved education and career prospects would also have a positive impact. But in the meantime we could start with seeing burglary for what it is. </p> <p>My friend with the baseball bat, a man committed to egalitarianism and social justice, tried to laugh off the experience when I asked him about it. But later he admitted that he hadn't slept properly since it had happened. Burglary is not cool. It's not revolutionary. It's an attack on the very heart of society: the home. If we can't grasp that, then why, you have to ask, should the burglars?</p>",
  "The \u00a34bn merger between the prison and probation service is so large and complex that it faces a high risk of failure, according to leaked internal Home Office documents. <p>An internal paper presented to the second board meeting of the newly merged organisation on Monday and seen by the Guardian also warns that the confidence of ministers, unions and staff is in danger of being lost. It adds there is a serious risk that the 74,900 prison population will start to rise again if officials are unable to persuade the courts to use new community punishments instead. </p> <p>The confidential paper also warns that there is a risk of a high-profile incident or industrial action causing disruption or overload within the overcrowded prison system. </p> <p>The \"summary of risks\" presented to this week's national offender management service [Noms] board meeting uses a colour-coded system to highlight the different levels of risk faced by the project. </p> <p>This is known in Whitehall as a \"traffic lights\" paper. The prisons and probation merger is unusual in that four of the 15 identified dangers facing the programme are rated black, indicating a \"high\" probability of their happening and carrying a \"high\" or \"very high\" impact. A further 10 factors are rated as \"red\", carrying the next highest level of risk. </p> <p>The dangers facing the launch of Noms have also been underlined by confidential advice from the office of government commerce in the Treasury, which has told the Home Office that it rates the merger as \"very complex\" and carry ing \"substantial risks\". The merger is designed to ensure that the prison and probation services cut reoffending levels, partly by capping the prison population at 80,000 and developing the use of community punishments instead. </p> <p>At the same time a \"contestability\" programme is being put in place under which initially juvenile jails and probation services will be market-tested with alternative private and not-for-profit providers to ensure value for money and that they are effective in turning offenders away from crime. </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, has called it a \"once in a generation opportunity to get it right\". A correctional services bill will be brought forward in the Queen's speech next month to implement the proposed changes. </p> <p>But the leaked document spelling out the risks faced by the project says that its \"complexity and scale and the scope of the overall change programme\" raises a high risk of \"failure to deliver the high expectations and expected benefits\". It adds that it is likely to be difficult to \"move forward cohesively\" with the danger of facing a \"loss of confidence by ministers, unions and staff\". </p> <p>The Prison Officers' Association voted last week not to participate in any of the new \"contestability\"schemes. </p> <p>Ministers are confident of getting their legislation through parliament intact. The risk of the corrections bill not being accepted or changed during its the parliamentary process is rated only as \"low\". </p> <p>The prison population has stabilised for several months at around the 75,000 mark, about 5,000 below the latest official projections.</p>",
  "<p>Soup is not the only thing getting thrown out of football stadiums these days. Compared with the attention devoted to \"Soupgate\", another issue has received only a soup\u00e7on of coverage: the demand by England's football authorities for a measure of control over the use of match day photographs, as well as a share of revenues from \"fantasy football\" competitions. The Newspaper Publishers Association, including this newspaper, is disputing an aggressive attempt by the Premier League and Football League's representatives to change the relationship with national newspapers. In the absence of an agreement by next Monday, reporters and photographers could be thrown out of football grounds, from Arsenal's Highbury to Kidderminster Harriers' Aggborough stadium. </p> <p>The centre of the dispute is the extent to which the football authorities can control image rights. In recent years, with the growth of digital media such as mobile phones and the internet, this has become an increasingly valuable issue. The newspapers argue that they have a right to cover football matches in the same way as other news events. The football authorities are concerned that rapidly transmitted photographs will erode their lucrative broadcasting rights. But instead of showing harm, the football authorities have moved precipitously. </p> <p>In seeking an embargo on game images, those running England's professional football leagues are running a risk. Barring journalists would be heavy-handed and pointless: the journalists will find other ways in on match days, and their employers can retaliate by removing references to league sponsors, as the Guardian has from today. As a result, Barclays will find itself getting less for its \u00a350m than it bargained for. While the likes of Manchester United may not suffer, smaller clubs may miss the publicity that brings fans through the turnstiles. The newspapers are right to worry: authorities in Germany and Holland have sought to take even tougher stances on this issue. Those running the Premier League and the Football League should think again, and stop spoiling the broth.</p>",
  "<p>Rupert Murdoch is normally courteous to his shareholders, but they were reminded of their irrelevance at yesterday's News Corp annual meeting: proxy votes had ensured 92% support for the move to the US state of Delaware. </p> <p>As such, the last general meeting in its Australian hometown was the rubber-stamping of a foregone deal and a typical piece of Murdoch theatre. He talked proudly of the Australian character of News Corp, though it took him several sentences to filter out the twang of an adopted American accent when he started speaking. </p> <p>Murdoch's face is normally wrinkled into a fist and when he smiles, it is more a baring of teeth. But he allowed himself some moments of uncharacteristic emotion yesterday in talking about his first agm, in a small boardroom a few blocks away from the hotel ballroom where more than 500 shareholders came yesterday. </p> <p>\"As I look across this vast ballroom, there are so many familiar faces, so many loyal shareholders,\" he said. The valedictory tone plays well with the hometown shareholder audience, and he sat down to heartfelt applause. But hours later he put his feelings about the reincorporation more bluntly: \"Let's be clear about this. This is a strictly legal piece of paper. We are not moving anyone or anything.\" </p> <p>For more than half a century he has chaired News Corporation's annual meetings in Adelaide, despite the fact that his attentions have been elsewhere ever since he bought his way into Sydney newspapers at the end of the 50s. </p> <p>He gained American citizenship in the 80s but still makes much of his origins in charge of a single, now defunct evening paper, the Adelaide News. The day before the agm he received the freedom of the city and laid the foundation stone of new offices for his South Australian paper, the Advertiser. Murdoch is used to having compliant boards and shareholders, and News Corp annual meetings are famously disciplined affairs where the most basic questioning has often been a rarity. His hold over his home town still combines the appeal of the infallible guru with that of the local boy made good. </p> <p>As the shareholders filed into their seats, the music playing in the background was a track by Everything But the Girl: Wherever You Go, I'll Follow You. The sentiment summed up the attitude of News shareholders: they can scoff about Murdoch's professed attachment to Adelaide, but if his loyalty is an illusion it is one in which they're happy to collude so long as he keeps laying the golden eggs. </p> <p>Extraordinarily for such a crucial meeting, a significant proportion of those standing up to pitch questions yesterday devoted their time to praising Murdoch's vision and management rather than questioning his plans for the company. Doyennes of Adelaide's old money set in pearls and twinsets, twentysomethings in surf shorts and T-shirts, earnest investors and troublesome professors all took their turn at the microphone. </p> <p>A few seemed to take umbrage at the course of events. A representative of the Australian Shareholders' Association objected to the level of boardroom remuneration: the 14 men on the rostrum took home pay and bonuses worth US$56m (\u00a330.5m) last year - and one shareholder sat down to applause after upbraiding Murdoch for taking his investors for granted. Shareholder William Burton said: \"For you, Mr Chairman, it may be a win-win situation but for me and many others it will be lose, lose, lose.\" </p> <p>The cut and thrust did not discomfit Murdoch too much; as at so many previous News Corp annual meetings, he knew he would get his way when it came to the vote.\"We've never had a meeting with so many questions,\" he said. \"I think we've all enjoyed it and learned a little from it.\" </p> <p>The US$48bn company, whose assets include BSkyB, the Sun and the Times newspapers, the Fox television and film group, and book publishers HarperCollins, announced plans in April to reincorporate in the US to get improved access to US capital markets. </p> <p>Yesterday's vote in favour of the shift will give Murdoch the licence he needs to consolidate his family's succession within the company and pursue his long-term ambition of taking control of the United States' lucrative television markets. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Murdoch was forced to defend his US TV channel Fox News over alleged bias: \"It's full of Democrats and Republicans, the others only have Democrats. We don't take any position at all. We're not in the least bit biased, we're a fair and balanced company.\" </p> <p>He admitted that News Corp newspapers, which include the New York Post, had supported Mr Bush's foreign policy and said they would continue to do so.</p> <p><strong>The winding road to a relisting</strong></p> <p>Yesterday's vote gives the go-ahead for News Corporation stock to cease trading on the Australian stock exchange on Tuesday. After this the shares will be sold off to Carlholt, a subsidiary of the new US-listed company, News Corp US. </p> <p>Carlholt will also buy the Cruden Group, which is majority-owned by the Murdoch family. Cruden controls Queensland Press, the only major part of Murdoch's Australian newspaper empire not controlled by News Corp. </p> <p>Queensland Press, with two city and eight small regional papers, is valued at A$2.95bn (\u00a31.2bn). This compares to Fairfax, Australia's second-largest newspaper company, at A$3.6bn. </p> <p>Australian shareholders will get one share in News Corp US for every two in the Australian company, but prices and dividends will be adjusted accordingly. </p> <p>The stock will be moved to Standard &amp; Poor's US indices in four tranches over nine months. When it will be listed in the S&amp;P200 index in New York - the aim of reincorporation - is uncertain. \"Certainly within the next 12 months,\" said Murdoch yesterday. \"We hope much earlier.\" </p> <p>Investors have had concerns over News Corp's low prices since reincorporation was announced in April but it has always been seen as a growth stock with few short-term benefits. It will still be traded in Australia via depositary instruments, just as News Corp was traded in the US. Reincorporation will cost about $49m.</p>",
  "<p>The fact that the appeal of the Peter Pan story is as constantly fresh as the boy himself has obviously been to the advantage of the holders of his copyright. JM Barrie gave the rights to the Great Ormond Street children's hospital in 1929, so that they have had 75 years of royalties from the 100-year-old child. But Peter Pan's unfailing appeal also poses problems - writers and film-makers are constantly trying to rework the original adventures, and it is becoming harder and harder for the hospital to keep control of the money that should be flowing to them as a result. </p> <p>At the moment the hospital is trying to fight the publication in the US of a prequel - Peter Pan and the Starcatchers - and also trying to prevent wider distribution of a sequel - After the Rain, a New Adventure for Peter Pan - which has been legally published in Canada. But there are places where these fights over copyright infringements become irrelevant. On the internet, no one can hear you sue. Fan fiction, the line of creation in which fans write their own stories in homage to their favourite tales and post them on the net, has become a huge and unpredictable phenomenon. Unsurprisingly, Peter Pan is a popular boy among the kids who post their tales on the fan fiction websites - on one, <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net,\">www.fanfiction.net,</a> you can find more than 800 Peter Pan sequels and prequels. </p> <p>Some fan fiction writers have received threatening letters from copyright holders of certain works - lawyers for JK Rowling have complained to the creators of sexually explicit works starring Harry Potter, Fox has complained about Buffy the Vampire fan sites, and Anne Rice has apparently tried to stamp out all homages to the Vampire chronicles. But most fan fiction creators - including the Peter Pan lovers - are left well alone. That's understandable, because these writers operate in a world where no money changes hands, and so nobody feels cheated. </p> <p>Even if anyone wanted to contain the energy of these writers, it's impossible to see how the phenomenon can now be controlled. While 800 Peter Pan homages on a single website may sound like a lot, it pales beside the greatest loves of the fan fiction world. The same website holds more than 34,000 Lord of the Rings offerings, and more than 150,000 Harry Potter spin-offs. </p> <p>Many authors and copyright holders probably think, complacently, that no one reads these rip-offs - that they are just the products of self-indulgent readers talking to themselves late at night, destined to die unread in corners of the ether. Yet since some of the Peter Pan stories also boast over 100 reviews, one can assume that people are also reading them, and if you look at the reviews, you can taste how enthusiastically those readers are entering the spinoff worlds: \"You are seriously amazing ... I cried reading this ... please update soon, the suspense is killing me.\" </p> <p>Fan fiction is generally derided as a semi-literate, usually pornographic genre providing nothing but in-jokes for geeks. It's true that sex plays a big part of this genre; sexy fan fiction has its own jargon - the term for it is \"slash\", as in Peter/Hook - and ratings to put off, or entice, underage readers. The sex goes all the way from the explicitly violent to the sort of softly suggestive games of consequences you might expect if an innocent Peter Pan met a lonely Harry Potter on a rooftop...</p> <p>By putting in the sexuality, the humour and the irony that the original tales often lack, these writers can change the way some readers see the works, and not always negatively. Indeed, if you have the patience to trawl a few websites, you can find memorably acute homages to various tales. Some of these fan fiction writers, with their mixtures of absurdity and seriousness, originality and nostalgia, communicate something of the hallucinatory way that readers first react to fiction. When you first fell in love with literature, didn't you weave the characters right into your life, into your own fantasies? </p> <p>Sometimes when I listen to my four-year-old daughter playing, I am reminded of the vivid, muddled contours of a fantasy landscape that you learn to distance yourself from as an older reader. I hear her chattering to herself and her dolls, taking Wendy and Peter Pan to visit Lucy and Mr Tumnus, before they dash off for tea with Cinderella. Later in life you work out how to become an onlooker of art, but in childhood you are free to live inside the stories you love. The writers of fan fiction recapture that childish bravado, those easy movements from one narrative to another and in and out of real life. As they reweave these stories they remind us that the boundary of the published book, and the control exerted by the individual author over a tale, is a relatively recent phenomenon for art, both in history and in our individual lives. </p> <p>Indeed, when it comes to fan fiction, the internet is giving us back something like an oral society, in which people can retell the stories that are most important to them and, in so doing, change them. For all the dross and smut they produce, these communities in which readers become writers, fans become creators and old tales become new, also give out blasts of energy. And they remind us that the power of these fantasy worlds are not built just on profit and loss, but on imagination responding to imagination. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:n.walter@btinternet.com\">n.walter@btinternet.com</a></p>"
