  "<p>Terry Newton will be free to play for Wigan against Wakefield in Friday's Super League elimination semi-final after escaping suspension yesterday for an alleged high tackle during Saturday's play-off match against St Helens. </p> <p>Although the Great Britain hooker broke his nose on his return from a broken thumb in Wigan's 18-12 win over Saints, he is fit to face the Wildcats. </p> <p>The Rugby Football League video review panel saved Newton another trip to headquarters tonight by ruling he had no case to answer for the tackle on the St Helens wing Ade Gardner which Saints' coach Ian Millward had claimed was so bad Gardner needed \"a bolt in his neck\". </p> <p>He was the subject of Millward's displeasure the last time the two sides met at the JJB Stadium when he collected a two-match ban for a challenge on Saints' Mike Bennett, so this latest let-off earned him a typically caustic comment. </p> <p>\"I'd like to know why a doctor [his club doctor] who has got a university degree said the player was knocked out by a swinging arm - you know what I mean?\" </p> <p>\"We should check the cameras to see if he was hit by a missile from outside the field of play,\" Millward added with more than a hint of mischief. </p> <p>Wakefield's key forward David Solomona, who had been reported for an alleged spear tackle, was also exonerated and can play in Friday night's game, from which the winner goes on to meet the loser of Saturday's qualifying semi-final between Leeds and Bradford for a place in the October 16 Grand Final. </p> <p>The Rhinos and Bulls would traditionally have played their first-versus-second match on a Friday, but with Wigan Athletic playing a Championship fixture at home on Saturday the dates had to be switched. It means Leeds will have to refund fans who cannot make the new one. </p> <p>Bradford, who yesterday re-signed Rob Parker on a two-year deal, have denied they are close to signing the Castleford prop Andy Lynch.</p>",
  "<p>Tanni Grey-Thompson yesterday became Great Britain's most successful Paralympian ever after winning her second gold medal of these games. </p> <p>The Welsh wheelchair racer led the T53 400 metres final from start to finish and retained her Sydney title in a Paralympic record time of 57.36sec. </p> <p>Grey-Thompson, already a 100m gold medallist in Athens, has now eclipsed the fencer Caz Walton's record of 10 career Paralympic gold medals with her 11th victory. Sweden's Madelene Nordlund took the silver while Italian Francesca Porcellato claimed bronze. </p> <p>\"I'm lost for words. There are just so many emotions running around in my head. It was a great race,\" she said. </p> <p>Grey-Thompson had to wake up at 5am as she had to be at the Olympic Stadium at least two hours before the race. The 35-year-old said the early start had been a struggle and the tears of joy as she crossed the finish line were testament to the relief at pulling off her victory. </p> <p>\"I was so nervous this morning because I really struggled to warm up, I just couldn't get my arms moving. But after the semi I had a great lane draw, I was so lucky to be in between Madelene Nordlund and Francesca Porcellato. Francesca got a great start and she pulled me along to a fast first 150m. </p> <p>\"When I got to the halfway point I still couldn't see who was around me so I just had my head down and went for it. When I crossed the finish line I did cry and that's not unusual for me. I was really surprised, I was expecting it to be a lot closer. It's probably one of my best 400m races and it's great to have done that at the Paralympics.\" </p> <p>Grey-Thompson failed to add to that morning success in the T54 200m later in the evening, finishing fourth in the more difficult open category in which she was the only T53 athlete. </p> <p>In the same race, the phenomenal Canadian Chantal Peticlerc became the first wheelchair athlete to win five gold medals at a single Games. </p> <p>Grey-Thompson, who got off to a bad start, was disappointed to miss out on the medals but admitted that victory would have been difficult in a race in which she was at a significant disadvantage. </p> <p>\"The difference that makes this race harder for me is that the T54 category athletes have stomach muscles and lower back muscles and that gives them more control at the start so I knew it was always going to be a tough race. But overall it's been a great games to be at, it feels unreal that it's all over.\" </p> <p>Grey-Thompson is unsure about whether she will aim to add to her record haul of medals in Beijing in four years' time. \"Right now I'd say yes, definitely, but when I get to the reality of winter training I may have second thoughts,\" she said. \"It's a decision for the whole family and I haven't got a clue whether I can do it or not.\" </p> <p>The cyclist Darren Kenny followed Grey-Thompson's medal-winning lead by adding a silver medal to his golden double at the games in the combined road race and time trial, while Britain's table tennis men's duo of Neil Robinson and James Rawson also claimed a silver after losing the gold medal match to Korea.</p>",
  "Turkey's parliament approved legal reforms yesterday that are expected to boost the country's chances of starting EU membership talks after the governing party dropped a move to criminalise adultery. <p>Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the penal code reform package in an emergency session only days before an EU progress report that will assess whether Turkey is ready to start accession talks. </p> <p>EU leaders had warned that the progress report, due to be published next week, could be negative if the adultery proposal was included in the new penal code. Opposition leaders and women's groups also opposed the provision, which was backed by MPs and activists within the Islamic-rooted Justice and Development party of the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. </p> <p>The reform package improves human rights standards and revamps criminal laws, imposing tougher measures against rape, paedophilia and torture. </p> <p>Conservative legislators' demands for an anti-adultery clause led to tensions with the EU and claims that such a measure was closer to Islamic than European law. \"Unfortunately, the debate over adultery has created serious doubts in Europe about Turkey's determination to preserve its secularity,\" said Onur Oymen, a lawmaker from the main opposition party. </p> <p>\"Even if this is solved, you've created a confidence problem.\" </p> <p>The vote came days after Mr Erdogan pledged to EU officials in Brussels that the reform package, which his party abruptly withdrew near the end of a recent parliamentary debate, would be passed in time for the EU progress report on October 6. </p> <p>EU officials have signalled that the report is likely to recommend that talks with Ankara begin, but have also indicated that it will be years before Turkey could become a full member. An EU decision on such talks may be made at the end of this year. </p> <p>\"I'm hopeful that membership negotiations will start in December and that a date will be set,\" Mr Erdogan said in a weekend state address. </p> <p>His party has made Turkey's EU goal a top priority, bringing in sweeping reforms, broadening freedom of expression, giving greater rights to minority Kurds and curtailing the army's role in politics.</p>",
  "<p>J Sainsbury is likely to find itself in the grip of takeover speculation again today following reports that a leading private equity group is plotting a bid for the struggling supermarket chain. </p> <p>Permira, the venture capital firm that bid unsuccessfully for WH Smith and Debenhams in the last 12 months, refused to comment yesterday on reports it is seeking financial backers for an offer. </p> <p>Rumours that Sainsbury's could receive a takeover approach have been circulating for a couple of weeks, triggering heavy trading in its shares. Several names have been mentioned including GUS, the owner of Argos and Homebase, and entrepreneur Philip Green, who had an offer rejected by Sir Peter Davis, the supermarket group's former chief executive, last year. </p> <p>The shares fell sharply last week following strong half-year results from rival Tesco and warnings from City analysts that next month's trading update could be dire and prompt a profits warning. </p> <p>One retail analyst, Philip Dorgan of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, went as far as predicting that Sainsbury's will make as little as \u00a3200m profit this year, about half of what the City is expecting, and the dividend will be slashed. Sainsbury's shares closed on Friday at 262.75p, valuing the company at \u00a34.5bn. </p> <p>Crucial to any deal will be the founding Sainsbury family. Although they are no longer involved in the day-to-day running of the business, its members control about a third of the shares and no offer can be successful without their blessing. </p> <p>For a financial bidder such as Permira the attraction lies with Sainsbury's freehold property portfolio, which is valued on the books at \u00a36.5bn but could be worth as much as \u00a38bn. Someone like Permira would look to finance its offer by selling a large chunk of the portfolio and reposition Sainsbury's as a niche player alongside Waitrose. </p> <p>Whether the Sainsbury family would be prepared to back such a deal is open to question - although, if Justin King, Sainsbury's chief executive, is forced to cut the dividend, many analysts believe they would be willing to listen. </p> <p>Mr King delivers his review of the business on October 19 and is expected to be critical of Sir Peter, who secured a payoff of \u00a33.1m, and tell shareholders that the \u00a33bn spent on updating the group's stores, IT and distributions systems was not value for money.</p>",

  "Germany's Social Democrat chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, suffered a humiliating election defeat in the party's traditional stronghold yesterday. <p>The SPD's worst performance in the important north-western state of North-Rhine Westphalia follows a grim 18 months for the chancellor, during which the party has experienced a string of poll setbacks. </p> <p>The only cheer for Mr Schr\u00f6der was that the poll victors, the opposition Christian Democrats (CDU), also forfeited support. They dropped six points from the last election, according to German public television poll projections last night. </p> <p>Yesterday's North-Rhine Westphalia elections, for town halls and local authorities, were seen as an important index of the national mood. The state of 17 million is Germany's most populous - and includes Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf, Dortmund and Essen - and is keenly contested. </p> <p>Elections next May for the state parliament and government will be the most important in Germany before the general election in 2006, at which Mr Schr\u00f6der is expected to go for a third term. </p> <p>According to TV projections last night, the CDU scored a comfortable 12-point victory over the SPD, with 44% to 32%, translating into control of most of the state's 23 metropolitan authorities. </p> <p>At the state level, the SPD governs North-Rhine Westphalia in coalition with the Greens, and has ruled the state for 38 uninterrupted years. </p> <p>But the Christian Democrats scored a sensational result in the last local authority elections in 1999, taking just over 50% of the vote to the SPD's 34%. </p> <p>Last night's result was not quite as good for the CDU, but still encouraging as it sets its sights on the SPD's power at state level. For the SPD, 1999's historic low has now been eclipsed. </p> <p>Yesterday's election was the last big one of the year in Germany. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der is licking his wounds after a series of regional and European election upsets, which have generated confident predictions of him being unseated in two years' time. </p> <p>Pundits and pollsters, however, are rapidly revising their analyses. They point out that Mr Schr\u00f6der's coalition shows signs of narrowing the gap on the CDU and free-market liberals. </p> <p>The central reason for the government's unpopularity has been Mr Schr\u00f6der's drive to slash unemployment benefits for the first time in post-war Germany, as part of a strategy to overhaul the welfare state. </p> <p>But with voters apparently becoming dimly aware that the conservative opposition could be even tougher in espousing \"reforms\", or cuts, public opinion is gradually shifting in the chancellor's favour. </p> <p>Faced with continuing bad news from the regional polling booths, government officials are seeking solace in the latest national opinion polls, which, for the first time since the welfare reforms were announced 18 months ago, have suggested majority support for the programme. </p> <p>A German television monthly barometer of public opinion reported on Friday that public approval for the reforms had risen from 35% to 48% in recent months. </p> <p>Wolfgang Clement, the economics minister, who is an important figure in the Schr\u00f6der cabinet - and was also a longtime prime minister of North-Rhine Westphalia - claimed yesterday that the unemployment figure of 4.6 million would be falling by next year. \"We' ll soon have a shift in the trend in the labour market,\" he told Welt am Sonntag. \"We've put the nadir behind us.\" </p> <p>But the government defeat yesterday was reinforced by a low turnout, indicating that traditional SPD supporters are protesting at Mr Schr\u00f6der's policies by staying at home. It was 53.5%, the lowest recorded in the state.</p>",
  "In October 1993, a large, bluff man in a loud check suit, with a badge on his lapel saying \"Welcome to Uttoxeter\", stepped forward to meet the newly fledged directors of the British Horseracing Board. It was typical of the founder and chairman of Northern Racing, Sir Stanley Clarke, who has died of cancer aged 71, to be the first to welcome the new racing establishment to his racecourse. <p>Clarke's extraordinary career was one that turned Upstairs Downstairs on its head. He was truly a person who had climbed the stairs and tasted both lives. </p> <p>Born in Burton-on-Trent, he took his first job at the local butcher, when he was only nine years old, to help support his family. His father Victor, a brewery worker, was an invalid suffering from tuberculosis, while his mother Mabel was employed as a maid at the local manor house. At 16, he became a plumber's apprentice and, after working at the manor house, made enough money to buy a plot of land for \u00a3125, which, with planning permission, he sold for \u00a3650. In later years, he bought the manor house, and settled there himself. </p> <p>This profitable venture was the basis of Clarke Homes, which grew to become the country's largest privately owned housebuilder, putting up more than 500 houses a year. In 1986, shortly before a property crash, Clarke sold the business to BICC for \u00a351m. This fortune, \u00a312m of which he shared with his employees, was parlayed into St Modwen Properties, which specialised in developing brownfield sites into modern shopping centres and out-of-town office parks. </p> <p>The capitalisation of the company grew from \u00a310m in 1986 to \u00a3268m in 2003, during which time it survived the property crash of the early 1990s. \"The banks got after us,\" Clarke said later. \"They told us we had to restructure, make a rights issue.\" As a result of this crisis, St Modwen used its rent roll to cover future dividends. The company now has a stock market valuation of \u00a3400m, with Clarke's own stake believed to be worth in excess of \u00a380m. </p> <p>Throughout his life, Clarke had been fascinated by horses and horseracing, and, in 1961, he took out a permit holder's training licence for a brief period, winning eight races. His greatest success as an owner came with Lord Gyllene, trained by Steve Brookshaw, which, in 1997, won the 150th Grand National. His best horse was Barton, trained by Tim Easterby, which won Cheltenham's Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Hurdle, among other high-class hurdle and steeplechase races. </p> <p>In the horseracing industry, however, Clarke will be best remembered for his development and management of racecourses. In 1988, after acquiring a lease on Uttoxeter racecourse from East Staffordshire district council, he substantially improved the facilities for racegoers, with new stands and prize money for the racehorse owners. </p> <p>Having seen how these policies paid off, with a substantial rise in gate and corporate hospitality income, Clarke went on to add a further seven courses to his portfolio, under the name of Northern Racing. This title was to prove a bit of a misnomer since his appetite to rescue ailing racecourses took him as far south as Brighton, Yarmouth, Bath and Fontwell, as well as to Newcastle, Sedgefield and Hereford. Taking a controlling stake in Chepstow Racecourse plc allowed him to reverse Northern Racing into it. </p> <p>Newcastle racecourse proved a particularly difficult problem, having fallen into a poor state of repair. But when Clarke stood up on a box in the cheap enclosure and told the fans they could look forward to better things, he got a rousing round of applause. He was was an active director of the Racecourse Association and, for a short time, director of the British Bloodstock Agency. He was elected to the Jockey Club in 1991. </p> <p>Clarke also devoted much of his time to raising money for charity. His particular interest was the Lichfield Cathedral Trust, of which he was chairman, raising \u00a36m not only for essential repairs, but also to help make the cathedral a centre of musical excellence. Racing welfare charities benefited to the tune of \u00a32m, while he also helped to raise \u00a38m for a new headquarters to house the Animal Health Trust at Newmarket. </p> <p>Clarke was appointed a CBE in 1990, and knighted in 2001. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2000, a disease he fought with enormous courage and good humour, retiring from his active roles at St Modwen and Northern Racing only a few months ago. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Hilda, whom he married in 1958, his son Simon, who succeeded him at Northen Racing, and three daughters. </p> <p>\u00b7 Stanley William Clarke, builder, property developer and racecourse owner, born June 7 1933; died September 19 2004</p>",
  "<b> Ramblers have been granted access to open country in England and Wales. What are the implications of the 'right to roam'? </b> <br> <p> <b> What is the right to roam? </b> </p> <p>The Countryside and Rights of Way Act has legally opened up areas of open countryside and common land in south-east and north-west England for the first time. Previously, walkers would have had to stick to footpaths... Access and rights of way in the countryside have been an issue in England since James Bryce MP introduced the first bill for freedom to roam in 1884. The bill was reintroduced every year until 1914 and failed each time. </p> <p> From the Lancashire Evening Telegraph, September 21 </p> <p> <b> How much land is affected? </b> </p> <p>Access to more than 91,000 hectares (227,000 acres) of land in the Forest of Bowland, Ribblesdale and the Peak District and nearly 14,000 hectares in Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire was granted under the terms of the act... Over the coming 15 months 1,100,000 hectares of land will become accessible. Nearly all areas designated as open country or common land are covered by the legislation. </p> <p> Harvey McGavin in the Independent, September 20 </p> <p><b> What is the thinking behind the legislation? </b> </p> <p>Landowners grumble that the right to roam gives any Tom, Dick or Harry licence to trample all over their property. That may well be the case. However, when their property comprises many of the most stunning vistas offered by this green and pleasant land, then they must accept that they have wider responsibilities... The right to roam should be the very least of the freedoms to which we are entitled. </p> <p> From an editorial in the Lincolnshire Echo, September 20 </p> <p> <b> Who will enforce the act? </b> </p> <p>The new right of access will be managed by local authorities and national park authorities. Magistrates will also be able to use greater powers to clear blocked paths and there will be tougher penalties for wildlife offences. </p> <p> From BBC News Online, September 18 </p> <p> <b> Does this mean walkers can roam without restriction? </b> </p> <p>There is, actually, no such thing as a \"right to roam\" which suggests an inalienable right to go wherever we like... What has changed is that the public can now walk over all mountain, moor, heath, down and common land defined as \"access land\" on an Ordnance Survey map. They cannot drive over it, ride over it, camp on it, swim in it or let their dogs run free across it. And, for four weeks a year, the landowner has the right to close it again. But it means that walkers no longer have to stick to designated tracks and footpaths. They can skip through heather and bog to their heart's content. </p> <p> Robert Hardman in the Daily Mail, September 20 </p> <p><b> What problems have arisen so far? </b> </p> <p>Ever since the bill was passed in 2000, the Countryside Agency has been painstakingly mapping the areas and deciding what places will be opened up... [But] mapping the land has not been a totally smooth process... In 2002, a couple in Bradwell, in the Hope Valley, were horrified to find part of their garden classed as moorland in the new maps, meaning ramblers could walk through it and even have a picnic outside their back door. </p> <p>From the Derby Evening Telegraph, September 18 </p> <p> </p> <p> <b> How has this been tied to the row over foxhunting? </b> </p> <p>Ramblers' spokesmen have been quick to deny any link between their right to roam and the bill to ban hunting with hounds... Yet the drive to make more private land available to ramblers has always had a political agenda... There remains a view in the Labour party that farmers and landowners should be seen not as fellow citizens or as custodians of the countryside, but as feudal barons who must be evicted from their rural redoubts by the brutal battering-ram of a statutory right to roam. </p> <p> From an editorial in the Yorkshire Post, September 20 </p> <p> <b> Are these concerns justified? </b> </p> <p>The expected invasion [of ramblers] is likely to be polite... We know this thanks to Ian Keirle, a University of Wales academic who spent a cold two days tracking walkers in Snowdonia in 2002. They were allowed to stray off the paths, but fewer than one in 10 did. Mr Keirle believes that, after a brief spell... everyone will resume their old routes. </p> <p> From an editorial in the Economist, September 18</p>",
  "In these uncertain years at the beginning of the 21st century and Washington's \"war on terror\", there are qualities middle America demands of a first lady, and Laura Bush seldom disappoints. <p>Poise. Grace. Good manners. Good looks. Those are the admiring comments that follow the presidential spouse on the campaign trail. This week brings her to five battleground states in three days. With polls suggesting that John Kerry is slowly eating away at Mr Bush's lead, Republican party officials joke that she is their stealth weapon. </p> <p>For a political wife who approved her husband's run for the presidency on the condition that she never be required to give a speech, Mrs Bush has become a crucial campaign asset. </p> <p>She has raised $10m (\u00a35.5m) at political fundraisers, and a Gallup poll gave her a 74% approval rating - far ahead of the president. </p> <p>Mr Bush's stock campaign ad shows Laura by his side, nodding as he talks about the pain of the September 11 attacks. He frequently begins his speeches by saying that the strongest argument he can make for his re-election is that Laura would return to the White House. </p> <p>The signs distributed at Ms Bush's campaign events read: \"W stands for women.\" When she appears in a modest auditorium in this small town in northern Wisconsin, Mrs Bush does not stoop to the conventional posturing of political wives. </p> <p>There are no fake hugs or air kisses, no pointing into the crowd in phony delight at recognising a friend. She waves, but only a bit, and with her elbow pinned to her waist. Once she begins reading her speech, her hands remain fixed on the podium, and only occasionally does she look at the crowd. </p> <p>When she does, she encounters near-universal delight. This congregation, as is the rule for Mrs Bush's events, is a careful collection of local Republican grandees and their friends. </p> <p>\"Classy, she's got real class,\" says Marlene Peterson, from Marathon, Wisconsin. She presses through the crowd to shake hands with the first lady, and reports that Mrs Bush possesses an unusually firm grip. \"It was like a ray of sunshine.\" </p> <p>Americans are split on what kind of woman they are looking for in the White House. In these parts, the higher-income end of a town where mores are fairly conservative, the partnership of Bill and Hillary Clinton is a thing of horror. Teresa Heinz Kerry, the wife of the Democratic candidate, is also suspect as a bit of a wild woman. </p> <p>Laura Bush, they say, is eminently more suitable. </p> <p>\"I think she is the example of a real lady. The other lady running has a lot of disqualifications,\" says Sharon Kolbe. \"She just doesn't have the decorum that Laura Bush has.\" </p> <p>Life in the White House has not been kind to assertive women. Mrs Clinton got her comeuppance with her spectacular failure to reform healthcare policy. Mrs Bush has been far more circumspect in pursuing her policy interest - literacy - discreetly inviting her favourite writers to the White House. </p> <p>She is far too disciplined to do much more than hint at disagreement with her husband's policies - as she did in an interview in October's GQ, when she intimated she did not share his rigid stance on abortion. </p> <p>\"She doesn't put herself before her husband. She supports her husband fully,\" says Sue Becker, whose daughter, Ann Hunger, adds: \"That's the way it should be, because her husband is the president.\" </p> <p>There are a few brave souls who say they prefer a woman with definite opinions, but they admit to feeling a bit lonely in Wausau. </p> <p>\"I think the first lady should have a story behind herself; but I don't imagine the rest of the country does,\" says Rebecca Pilgrim-Tylinski, a lawyer. </p> <p>After growing up an only child in Midland, Texas, Laura Welch as a young woman was interested in culture and travel. She visited Europe after college and worked as a teacher and a librarian. </p> <p>She was 30 - and a Democrat - when she met and married Mr Bush. The couple were the only ones among their friends still single at the time. </p> <p>Marriage into America's pre-eminent dynasty had its trials. Until he became a Christian, Mr Bush was an alcoholic. In 1986 Mrs Bush is said to have offered him the choice: \"Jim Beam or me.\" Their twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, 22, have a string of arrests for underage drinking. </p> <p>But none of those faults in the first family - not even Mrs Bush's surreptitious smoking habit - detract from her appeal on the campaign trail. </p> <p>During the past few weeks, opinion polls have detected a slide in Mr Kerry's popularity among women - generally one of the Democratic party's core areas of support.

  "A respected London legal firm signed a private deal to destroy documents in what it publicly hailed as a \u00a37.5m \"landmark\" asbestos compensation settlement for South African workers, according to a confidential agreement obtained by the Guardian. <p>Leigh Day, a firm of solicitors with a reputation for fighting public interest cases, fought UK-based Cape plc all the way to the House of Lords to secure a deal for the former employees. </p> <p>The three-page unpublished memorandum discloses that as part of the deal, Leigh Day also agreed to be paid by Cape to prevent other legal teams obtaining papers uncovered during the litigation. It was eventually decided that instead of being shredded, the documents would be put in storage. </p> <p>Leigh Day was forced on to the defensive yesterday as a Labour MP vowed to raise the matter in the Commons and a group representing asbestos victims in Scotland condemned the lawyers. </p> <p>Clydebank &amp; Milngavie MP Tony Worthington, said he applauded Leigh Day's battle on behalf of 7,500 former Cape employees in South Africa suffering asbestos-related illnesses but was shocked that the law firm had agreed to shred documents that could assist other claimants. </p> <p>\"I thought it was a fundamental principle of British justice that you wouldn't have a settlement in a case if this would make it more difficult for the next group of sufferers to get justice,\" the MP said. </p> <p>Leigh Day secured legal aid to sue Cape in Britain over its operations in South Africa, where it mined and processed asbestos, a material responsible for fatal diseases. </p> <p>An out-of-court \u00a37.5m deal was struck last year after accountants warned that Cape's asbestos subsidiary was unable to fund an initial \u00a320m settlement. </p> <p>Sally Moore, a Leigh Day partner, said Cape had insisted that the three-page memorandum in 2003 was a \"deal breaker\", threatening to deny the South Africans compensation unless the lawyers agreed to destroy documents and resist their disclosure. </p> <p>Other legal firms pursuing asbestos claims expressed surprise that Leigh Day signed up to such a draconian clause, pointing out solicitors were already prevented from publishing documents if a case was pursued out of court. </p> <p>Ms Moore said that, after receiving complaints from the Clydebank Asbestos Group in Scotland, the legal firm had persuaded Cape to allow it to return rather than shred copies of documents. \"There is no embarrassment for Leigh Day... I feel that it is an absolute travesty that we are somehow being castigated for something that we did given what we achieved in terms of compensation,\" she said. </p> <p>Robert Dickie, chairman of the Clydebank Asbestos Group, said in a letter to Leigh Day: \"We find it totally unacceptable to destroy documents, which may have value in future cases and the right of the public to all knowledge in this field.\" </p> <p>Asbestos companies and their insurers face a rising bill from incurable mesothelioma, an asbestos disease that takes up to 40 years to develop, with new cases in Britain predicted to triple to nearly 10,000 a year within two decades. </p> <p>Wakefield-based Cape referred calls to the Bell Pottinger public relations company where a PR executive was unable to explain why the company had insisted on the controversial clause. </p> <p>He said: \"Cape will always deal responsibly with any claim that comes in. They have all the original documents in a purpose-built archive in Doncaster.\"</p>",
  "Does anyone still seriously believe there will still be an American army of occupation in Iraq in two years' time? A great many people, most of them Iraqis, will be killed before the Americans can leave, but the signs are clear enough that they can't stay. In Vietnam, the Americans were famously advised to declare victory and get the hell out. In Iraq, the only strategy left is to declare democracy and get the hell out. <p>Even this will be difficult, but the alternatives are simply impossible. Meanwhile, other bad things will happen that are the ineluctible consequences of this administration's misdeeds. The tax cuts will have to be paid for; the dollar will have to come down; al-Qaida or some similar network will do something atrocious either in the USA or in Britain.</p> <p>So why should anyone vote for John Kerry? Here is Mr Bush, like a conman on a spree in a luxurious restaurant, caught at the moment when the manager approaches to say that there seems to be a problem with his credit card. Someone, soon, is going to be washing the dishes for a week to pay the bill. Justice demands it should be Mr Bush; but if Mr Kerry wins, he'll be the skivvy in the kitchen and he will be blamed for everything.</p> <p>I've made the argument myself, though I know it is merely a filigree on despair. If, as seems perfectly possible, Mr Bush wins the election this year then we will all be looking for some consolation, and that's the only scrap that I can find. </p> <p>It isn't negligible. A weak Kerry presidency followed be a Republican resurgence would be a disaster, and it will be a very remarkable president who can get through the next four years without looking weak. Maybe it would be better to grit our teeth and wait for the time of proper and unmistakable nemesis.</p> <p>But there are two arguments against this. The first one stems from competence. Disaster isn't a binary state. No matter how bad things get, George Bush can make them worse. There are some men who are useless leaders in peacetime but splendid in times of war. In four years, Bush has proven himself exceptional: he has been given the chance to fail in times of both peace and prosperity, and at a time of war and danger. He has made the most of both. Who knows how he might not exploit the opportunities of a second term?</p> <p>John Edwards said last week: \"If American voters want four more years of job losses and chaos and killing in Iraq, then George W. Bush is their guy. If not, they will vote for John Kerry.\" I suspect they will get four more years like this whoever they vote for. But at least they will have leadership capable of minimising the damage.</p> <p>The second argument is moral. For Bush to win requires that people vote for him, and I honestly don't see how anyone with a scrap of moral feeling and patriotism could vote for the government responsible for Abu Ghraib. There's no doubt that the Bush government is entirely responsible for the torture there, and elsewhere. The original decision that the Geneva convention's prohibition of torture was \"quaint\" came from a White House lawyer, Alberto Gonzalez. The general whose visit from Guantanamo Bay to Abu Ghraib seems to have led to the institutionalisation of torture there has now been appointed the governor of the prison.</p> <p>The details of what is done there can be read by anyone who wants to know in official American government reports. A very small fraction of General Fay's report describes how one detainee was \"left naked in his cell for extended periods, cuffed in his cell in stressful positions (\"High cuffed\"), left with a bag over his head for extended periods, and denied bedding or blankets\" and made to \"bark like a dog, being forced to crawl on his stomach while MPs spit and urinated on him, and being struck causing unconsciousness.\"</p> <p>Even on a completely amoral and pragmatic judgment, this was force misapplied. The tortures described were perpetrated last autumn. Can anyone claim that the Americans have better intelligence or more control over the insurgency today than they did a year ago?</p> <p>But on a moral level, which is where both candidates are appealing to their voters, this is quite simply indefensible. Only one thing could make it worse, and that Mr Bush has duly done. He has claimed that it was legal, because he ordered that it should be.</p> <p>No, this is no time for pity and frivolity. Democracy has to mean millions of people saying, in November, \"Christ, you can't do that\", and making him hear.</p> <p>* Andrew Brown is the author of The Darwin Wars: The Scientific War for the Soul of Man and In the Beginning Was the Worm: Finding the Secrets of Life in a Tiny Hermaphrodite.

  "<p>Flags were at half mast, which was right for Brian Clough but half a mast too high for Boro, who had no excuse for bunting at all and little for so barren a performance. And that in turn gave Chelsea less reason to celebrate than they found. </p> <p>\"Pass the ball\" was Clough's mantra and he did not mean to the opposition. Boro gave the ball away a dozen times in the first five minutes and got little better - and this under a man tipped to be the England manager Clough never was. If only they could have heard the green jersey in the sky. </p> <p>Clough scored 197 goals in 213 games for Boro, compared with Michael Ricketts' three in 32. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's rate at Chelsea was one in two but he and his team-mates, playing at home, did not give Petr Cech anything to save. \"It only takes a second to score a goal,\" said Clough. Boro have gone two league games and a half without managing it. </p> <p>Chelsea had gone three and a half until, nine minutes from the end, they caught Boro's defence unawares and averted a third successive goalless draw. Frank Lampard made as if to flight a free-kick, Didier Drogba dropped off and, as Jose Mourinho said, \"they made a connection\". </p> <p>It enabled the manager to be more engagingly embattled than after Spurs denied them the previous week. Then, though acknowledging an imbalance in power, he had complained at Spurs' lack of ambition. Imagine Ronnie O'Sullivan chiding an opponent for snookering him on the basis that people had come to see him clear the table. What are managers for if not to outwit and overcome whatever confronts them? </p> <p>In victory rather than frustration Mourinho could see how his side might be asked peculiarly thorny questions: \"Every opinion remembers the financial side. Every knife is in Chelsea's direction, all the flowers in the other direction. But we have to live with it.\" </p> <p>For the moment he is having to live with a side making too little penetration, then wasting what does get through. \"We control our opponents and control the game,\" said the control freak. \"Just the important last touch is missing. One day somebody will be unlucky.\" </p> <p>At the present rate of striking, a goal a game, somebody will be very unlucky. Drogba, all \u00a324m of him, missed golden, silver and bronze chances before scoring. Damien Duff, in his first start, needed the example of Boro's substitute Stewart Downing to go wide enough for maximum effect. Paulo Ferreira shaped to overlap more than he dared. </p> <p>Mourinho, for all his access to Russian oil fields, cannot find a drop for his attack. This is a side whose defensive instinct surpasses in organisation that which is condemned in others and may be found in his old charges and champions Porto on Wednesday. Asked if it would be emotional, he said: \"No, no. There is no room for emotion. There are no friends in football in the 90 minutes.\" </p> <p>Boro, still starry-eyed about Europe as they go to Ostrava with a 3-0 lead, had Colin Cooper, 37, pressed into service beside Gareth Southgate, 34, stalwarts to embarrass what the Lib-Dems might call \"Chelsea tractors\". The 65th-minute substitutes said more: for Chelsea two at \u00a313m the pair, for Boro an 18-year-old debutant from Darlington. </p> <p>Boro, already depleted, lost three more in action. Hasselbaink, after 10 stitches in a head wound, bloodied so many No18 shirts that he finished in one of Ugo Ehiogu's. It was as well he was not booked, and he might have been for uttering a false instrument. No wonder Boro were wan. Clough said he wanted \"no profound epitaph\" but he cannot have expected a 90-minute silence.</p>",
  "<p>The Wayne Rooney-like rise of Eniola Aluko, the 17-year-old <strong> Charlton</strong> striker, continued apace as she became the youngest England debutante in Hope Powell's six-year tenure as the national coach. </p> <p>Aluko, who at 14 was playing Premier League football for Birmingham City, was in the starting line-up for each of England's two matches against Holland last week. </p> <p> Still based in Birmingham, where she is preparing for A-levels with the aim of studying law at university, Aluko is eligible to play at Under-19 level for the next two seasons. </p> <p>But, like Rooney, she has been fast-tracked into the senior set-up and has not been considered for the squad which this week will be in Yorkshire contesting a four-nation qualifying tournament for the European Under-19 Championship finals. </p> <p>Yesterday she helped Charlton move top of the Premier League with a 4-0 win away at <strong> Bristol City</strong>, as the <strong> Everton-Arsenal</strong> game was postponed due to Under-19 call-ups. </p> <p> In the only other games of a reduced top-flight programme, <strong> Doncaster Rovers Belles </strong> beat <strong> Fulham</strong> 1-0 and <strong> Leeds United</strong> won 8-3 against <strong> Liverpool</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>There can have been few quieter minutes at Pride Park than the one that preceded this kick-off. Beneath skies as sombre as the mood, 26,000 stood in hushed remembrance of Brian Clough. It truly was the sound of silence. </p> <p>Although his contribution to football in another part of the east midlands is more widely recognised, his impact and legacy at Derby should not be underestimated. </p> <p>Ask any Rams fan of a certain age for his or her fondest football memories and you will receive a dewy-eyed reminiscence of the joys of Clough's 1971-72 championship-winning team. The giant old league trophy was on the pitch before this game,a reminder of past glories. </p> <p>With the hand of history reaching out from 32 years ago to lay an expectant clasp on their shoulders, it is to George Burley's young side's great credit that they refused to wilt in the spotlight. </p> <p>Their performance was one of misplaced passes and dead-end runs but also, perhaps most importantly on such a day, bags of heart. </p> <p>\"The players gave it their best shot and tried to win the game,\" said Burley. \"It's what he [Clough] would have wanted from a Derby player.\" </p> <p>The light reflected in that league trophy is a harsh one in which to judge the current Derby side - comparing Clough's team with Burley's would be a pointless, not to say unfair, exercise. A more pertinent contrast is the one between the directionless side inherited by Burley and the one that survived Wigan's early swagger to match the Latics in the second half. </p> <p>The result might have been even more favourable had Inigo Idiakez's slovenly control not presented Lee McCullogh with the equaliser within seconds of Tommy Smith nodding the Rams ahead.</p>",
  "<p>All was quiet on the west London front. Fulham were tired of war games while the inaccuracy of Southampton's shooting suggested that they, too, did not want to cause trouble. </p> <p>After two weekends of rows and ructions involving Fulham it was decided that the occasion warranted a more experienced referee than Mark Clattenburg, newly promoted to the Premier League list. </p> <p>Enter Graham Poll the peacemaker to control Saturday's game at Craven Cottage with a smile and a shrug and refrain from booking anybody until Southampton's Neil McCann gave him little option three minutes from the end with a two-footed lunge at Moritz Volz. </p> <p>Fulham's victory, courtesy of a header from Tomasz Radzinski and several sharp saves by Edwin van der Sar, satisfied the desire of their manager, Chris Coleman, to draw a line under the controversies of the Arsenal game and the punch-up at West Bromwich Albion. </p> <p>Yet the bottom line remains. Fulham are up before the Football Association on Wednesday week charged with failing to control their players at The Hawthorns with Coleman facing action for his remarks after the Arsenal match. </p> <p>Fulham were walking a tightrope and it showed. While their football remained committed there was still a guarded air about the performance particularly when their narrow lead came under increasing pressure. </p> <p>Southampton had opportunities to nudge this nervous high-wire act off balance but took too long to find the target - and when they did, they were thwarted by Van der Sar, who saved superbly from Kevin Phillips in the first half and James Beattie and Rory Delap in the second. </p> <p>Even when a slip by Ian Pearce eight minutes from time left Phillips with just the goalkeeper to beat this normally reliable finisher dragged the ball wide. Small wonder that Steve Wigley, still without a win since he took over following the sacking of Paul Sturrock, complained that \"we just did not take our chances and at a level like this we will get punished\". </p> <p>At the moment all that is keeping Southampton out of the bottom three is the late, mysterious penalty against Blackburn which they were awarded by Andy D'Urso and which brought them their only league victory of the season so far. Since then they have taken one point from five games. </p> <p>Should one or more of the three promoted sides below them start winning, Wigley's observation that \"I'm certainly not looking over my shoulder\" may return to haunt him. </p> <p>Whether he is manager or head coach, anyone in charge of Southampton should glance round occasionally to check where Rupert Lowe, the club's jolly hockey stick of a chairman, is. Another few defeats and Lowe may begin wondering who his next manager of the month might be. </p> <p>Southampton supporters are a tolerant bunch but can be vindictive when their patience is stretched. Witness the merciless hounding of a previous Southampton manager, Ian Branfoot, when he began to leave out the Dell's icon, Matthew Le Tissier. </p> <p>On Saturday they booed Wigley's decision just on the hour to take off Anders Svensson, who had consistently linked the play, to bring on McCann. The coach was subjected to chants of \"You don't know what you're doing\". </p> <p>His explanation - that to get behind Fulham the team needed the extra width that McCann did indeed provide - was fair enough. But why sacrifice Svensson rather than, say, the less effective Delap? </p> <p>Fulham's winner, on 24 minutes, followed Adam Green's overlapping run on the left and Luis Boa Morte's well judged centre which Radzinski nodded past Antti Niemi. </p> <p>\"Did we deserve to win?\" asked Coleman, \"maybe not, but we have ground out a 1-0 win and maybe we need to do that a bit more.\" Certainly Southampton need to start grinding - and quick.</p>",
  "\"My views on politics are, at the moment, rather jaundiced. I am extremely annoyed with our local council and feel that local government uses national government as an excuse for its mismanagement. <p>\"I would like the whole system to be redefined. Locally we are becoming a town where violence and lawlessness rule. The excuse is that there is not enough money for more police, but many of the local libraries are to be closed along with public toilets, in an effort to save money.</p> <p>\"The gritters are to be reduced from 6 to 5 this winter in a cost saving exercise. Something is wrong somewhere. If things aren't right locally, then people do not feel inclined to widen their views. </p> <p>\"This produces more insular attitudes and isolates Westminster further. The local MPs are not acting in the best interests of the towns they represent, so how do the cabinet ministers get to know the views of the general public?</p> <p>\"My main concern is the breakdown of law and order and the total disregard to any rules. Violence, alcohol-related crime and vandalism are common day occurrences in the town where I live and I am sure this is reflected in towns and cities up and down the country. There are broken-down estates where decent people have to live amongst boarded up houses which have gardens full of rubbish and burnt out cars in the street. They have to try and make a home whilst being terrified to go out. </p> <p>\"Rubbish is thrown away at random, schoolchildren shout and swear in the street; red lights and other road warning signs are ignored and nothing is done. Oh, yes, there are laws, but who does anything about enforcing them? There just aren't enough police to cope with the problems. </p> <p>\"The mobile phone ban whilst driving is just one example of a law which cannot be enforced. For every person caught using their phone whilst driving, there are hundreds getting away with it and only if they have an accident would anybody be any the wiser. </p> <p>\"No one seems willing or able to do anything about the deterioration in the fabric of the country. The police are fighting a losing battle and need to have more power to act. Teachers need more power and discipline should be applied from the very start of a child's school life, as used to be the case. Punishments meted out by the courts are not a deterrent, as all too often the culprits seem to get away with their actions. </p> <p> \"This article is a pr\u00e9cis of one I wrote to David Blunkett.

  "\"Up until 1997 I had always voted Liberal and then Liberal Democrat and was active as a party member during the 1970s and 80s. I was a borough councillor for seven years during that period. <p>\"In 1997, I voted Labour nationally for the first time and I did again in the last election. My reasoning for this at the time was that it was a tactical vote to get the then Tory MP out in a Labour/Tory marginal and then keep the Tories out - this has been the result since 1997. Nevertheless, I confess that I was also impressed with the Labour line-up and campaign, so in that sense I was a 'positive' Labour voter. I have, however, continued to vote Lib Dem locally.</p> <p>\"As might be expected from that background, I am enthusiastic about Europe, I approve of the current public expenditure strategy in general terms but, while I recognise the benefits of private sector involvement in public sector affairs, I am not convinced that this has resulted in tangible benefits of the order I was expecting. </p> <p>\"I was not in favour of the latest health service reforms for example. I have also come to believe that David Blunkett has become the most rightwing home secretary of recent times and I am horrified by the initiatives he has taken or not taken in respect of law and order and immigration. </p> <p>\"I am virulently against the war in Iraq. In spite of the fact that I am a dual US/UK national with most of my family living in the US, I am appalled at the degree to which we have become allied with the US in foreign policy matters. These issues make it difficult for me to consider voting Labour again while Tony Blair, Jack Straw and David Blunkett are in charge, even if it does let the Tories in.\"</p> <p><b>More about me</b></p> <p><b>Family: </b>Wife and three children; Tom (20), Rose (11) and Anna (7)</p> <p><b>What was the last book you read? </b> A Man In Full, Tom Wolfe</p> <p><b>What are your hobbies and interests? </b> Amateur dramatics, computing, current affairs</p> <p><b>What are your five favourite websites? <br></b> <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk\">BBC News Online</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">Guardian Unlimited</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk\">eBay</a><br><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\">Amazon</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nyt.com\">New York Times</a></p> <p><b>How did you vote in the last general election? </b> Labour in the general election, Liberal Democrat in local elections</p> <p><b>How do you follow political events? </b> I am keenly interested in politics and current affairs and generally watch TV programmes devoted to this subject, as well as reading a selection of newspapers regularly.

  "\"Disillusion, distrust and disinterest. Actually disinterest is not quite true, or I wouldn't be answering these questions. What I mean is disinterest in the bickering and squabbling that goes on both inside and outside the House of Commons. Am I alone in being amazed at watching parliamentary debates and seeing them boo and hiss each other? I mean, really! It's like watching a pantomime or a playground brawl. What century are we in? Surely there is a more civilised way of going about things. <p>\"Distrusting politicians is becoming more and more prevalent in everyday society. I think this is very sad. If we can't trust the people that we elect to govern our lives then who can we trust? I am sick of watching political interviews and being left with the feeling that the politician didn't believe a word they uttered. Everybody makes mistakes, it's part of life, so why is it so difficult to admit that in politics? 'We made a mistake. We're sorry. We've all learnt from it, so let's move on.' Instead you simply get cover-ups and unexplained U-turns. </p> <p>\"I'm sure that many people are disillusioned by today's politics, particularly after the Iraq war. I don't remember meeting one person who was for it. Yet all the marches and petitions amounted to nothing. Nobody was listening. The decision had been made. It would have been interesting to see the result if we had gone to the polls. But that would have been too much like democracy. As Douglas Adams wrote: \"... those who crave power should on no account be given it ...\" Surely there is something in this.</p> <p>\"I didn't vote in the last general election or my recent byelection. This is not because I was ill, or on holiday, or because I couldn't be bothered to go to the polling station - it was a conscious choice. I deliberately decided not to take part in the ludicrous popularity contest that is British politics. And yet I am very interested in politics. I watch the news, and read the papers, and I've seen almost every episode of Yes, Minister. But when it comes down to it I feel that I don't really care which committee of suited bureaucrats is in power, or that my vote actually makes any difference to the good of the country. </p> <p>\"I am the perfect example of a floating voter, because I have no personal party allegiance. In fact, I find the party system quite unfathomable. I am pro-Europe but patriotic; anti-hunting but believe in individuals' rights; anti-war but also anti-terror and oppression; a Socialist that would love to be rich; and a liberal who would like to see gangs of yobs sent to boot camp! I would like to see politics become honest and open, but maybe that is a contradiction in terms. </p> <p>\"I believe in good education, good healthcare, a fair welfare system and, above all, tolerance. But I feel like actual politics doesn't effect any of these things - regardless of which party is in power. There are good people doing wonderful things, but do we really need the politics, and the bickering, and the mud-slinging, press conferences and the huge amounts of money wasted on party campaigns and slogans?

I like to get the weekend newspapers and catch up properly</p> <p><b>What do you think are the three most important issues for the next election?</b><br> I think that the war in Iraq will continue to effect the way that people vote in the next election, but more emotionally than politically. Nerves are still very raw and people feel that they were lied to and bullied into a terrible conflict, which was none of our business. </p> <p>Europe will remain a very central issue, especially with the recent success of Ukip in the European elections. It seems that if a party is not in power they can have a clear policy on it, but as soon as they get into government the edges start to blur. It was that way in the eighties under the Conservatives, and it has been that way under Labour. Nobody is willing to accept the inevitable, if it means losing popularity, it's easier to sit on the fence. </p> <p>Aside from all the big issues I think that most people just want better public services. They want to see a genuine improvement in things that affect day to day living: good schools, clean hospitals and safe streets. It's very easy to say in manifestos, but can any party really deliver this? </p> <p> <b>Who would you sack from the cabinet if you could?</b><br> I think the problems lie much deeper than simply sacking members of the cabinet, unless you replace them with people who actually know what they're doing. I don't really have strong feelings about specific cabinet members, who are surely only figureheads for large departments of unelected civil servants. It doesn't seem to matter who does the job when nothing really seems to change. Also, everything takes so long to debate and implement that the responsible minister (or even government) has probably already moved jobs when the effects start to be felt.</p> <p><b>And who would you appoint to the cabinet? (It needn't be a politician)</b><br> I can't help feeling that politicians should be chosen because they have specific skills in the departments they are going to run. For example, I don't understand how a person with no military background or training can be made defence secretary. And if they only get to do the job for two or three years, how they are supposed to get a grip on it? It seems to suggest that they are simply figureheads for departments run by people who we do not vote for, which makes me question the concept of democracy. </p> <p>Having said all this I think it would be interesting to see what comedians and political commentators would do if they were running the country. Perhaps Jeremy Paxman as prime minister and John Humphrys as chancellor. Or Billy Connolly and Eddie Izzard in the top jobs. It would be so refreshing to have a little honesty.</p>",
  "\"I am a full-time carer for my mentally handicapped brother, living on the Isle of Anglesey. I voted Labour (Albert Owen) at the last general election but previously I had voted Plaid Cymru - mainly to prevent a Tory getting in. <p>\"Ynys Mon has an interesting political history; solidly Labour as long as Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos stood, it surprisingly fell to the Tories after a vigorous campaign by Keith Best, who turned out to be an active and well thought of MP until his fall from grace. Ieuan Wyn Jones then took the seat for Plaid Cymru and held it until he decided to concentrate on his work as party president and leader in the Welsh assembly.</p> <p>\"His anointed successor was Eilian Williams, another local solicitor who was widely expected to be a shoo-in. It all went pear-shaped for a number of reasons, most importantly over-confidence. </p> <p>\"Ynys Mon will be one of the most interesting seats and one of the most difficult to predict. We had the highest turnout in Wales at the assembly elections, when Ieuan Wyn Jones held his seat. Albert Owen has a thin majority and the war in Iraq is even less popular in Wales than in Britain as a whole. Plaid's candidate is a relative heavyweight, Eurig Wyn, an ex-MEP whose chosen battleground is the lack of affordable housing for local people and, bafflingly, that more people are unemployed than the government stats say. The subtext is - English people are buying our houses and we don't like it.</p> <p>\"The Conservatives missed a trick in not selecting Peter Rogers (who was capable of winning) and at present have no candidate. The key for me is to stop Plaid Cymru winning.

  "\"I am worried that my involvement in this country's political life has dropped off to virtually zero. Issues that matter to me: social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth; sustainable transport, energy and agricultural policies; and the promotion of fair trade and sustainable development, driving the UK's impact on the developing world -the \"ethical foreign policy\" that Robin Cook tried to pursue. <p>\"In the past I mainly worked as a musician and teacher. I am presently writing a book about Portuguese India. I studied history at Oxford in the mid-70s and one of my friends from that period was the lead guitarist in Ugly Rumours - I actually saw Tony Blair singing with the band. I am utterly baffled by the parallel universe that he has moved into since then, he hardly seems to reflect any of the radicalism that was around in the mid-70s - or perhaps he has rejected it. Most of my 'class of '75' friends now have kitchen table rants about how disconnected he has become.</p> <p>\"One of the worst aspects of Tony Blair's style of government for me has been the erosion of democracy. For example, when Ken Livingstone was squeezed out of the selection process as New Labour's mayoral candidate; his expulsion from the party, and the subsequent attempts to nobble his independant candidacy. After he was elected - and therefore given a clear democratic mandate by London voters to take control of the underground network - the government still proceeded with privatisation of the tube.</p> <p>\"I'd be a bit happier with Gordon Brown as PM, but I shan't forget that he also considered his public-private partnership agenda more important than the voters' wishes. Robin Cook I do respect; it's a pity British electorates never go for men with beards (or bald pates, or Welsh accents).</p> <p>\"Iraq is something I will never forgive: the suppression of debate; the deceptions and bad faith (including the months pretending to the UN that the UK was committed to arms inspection, when in fact the decision to go to war had already been taken); and the ignoring of the largest popular political demonstration in British history - to name but a few of the issues.</p> <p>\"What this adds up to for me is a devaluation of the coinage of democracy. What's the point in expressing our preferences when the prime minister does exactly what he feels like? And in the company of other political leaders whose politics most British voters reject, like Bush, Berlusconi and Aznar? And how can the public be expected to make any informed decisions on issues like War and entry into the Eurozone when he either presents incomplete/bogus information or (re: the Euro) chooses to say almost nothing? The big question these days is, does voting make any difference at all?</p> <p>\"The last time I voted was in 1994 - Lib Dem on the grounds that at least they were being honest about a need to finance re-investment in public services via a higher rate of income tax for upper-bracket earners. But the Lib Dems, despite scoring for opposing the Iraq war, have tended to behave more like Tories in those areas where they have unseated Labour, like Islington council. </p> <p>\"I guess I'm a mild green socialist really (sounds like a washing up liquid). I'd like to see a more radical and green agenda being pursued, but I'm not a fellow traveller with Trotskyists, who I find too dogmatic, authoritarian and, frankly, narrow-minded. I'd love to actively support the Green Party, but I find their leadership (or lack of it) uninspiring, and some of their policies too half-baked. </p> <p>\"Where does this leave me? I used to think I'd become quite middle-of-the-road, but the shift of New Labour to the right has left me feeling like a crusty revolutionary wailing in the wind. Judging by how my friends feel, I'm certainly not the only one. Truth is, at the moment I don't feel there is really a party I can vote for who advocate the kind of progressive, globally aware politics that represent me as a voter. I'd like an 'abstain' option on the ballot paper and a box in which I can write down exactly why I haven't voted. I will not now vote tactically just to keep out a party or individual I don't like. I think British voters deserve something better than a choice between an evil and a lesser evil, and I don't think our electoral system does us any favours.\"</p> <p><b>More about me</b></p> <p><b>Family: do you have a partner/children?</b> No</p> <p><b>What was the last book you read?</b> The White Mughals by William Dalrymple</p> <p><b>What are your hobbies and interests?</b> Travel, art, walking and trekking, music, colonial history, anti-globalism</p> <p><b>What are your five favourite websites?</b> I use sites primarily for research, sourcing materials, banking, and booking flights, etc. When I'm travelling I rely on <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">Yahoo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">Guardian Unlimited</a> for home news and current affairs</p> <p><b>Your views on politics:</b> Alienated!

  "<p>You might be considering Tefl as a gap year option after university, as a career break, as something more long-term to provide a whole lifestyle change, or as part of a (pre) retirement plan.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, we think it is unfair to step out in front of your students without being properly prepared, be they top-paying business executives or disadvantaged street children. </p> <p>A course of 100-plus hours, regardless of the exam board, is likely to provide you with the tools you'll need to go away and start teaching students of all levels. These courses are similar to taking a driving test - once you've got it, you're still very much a learner driver, but you do have the foundations required on which to build up your experience. To continue the analogy, shorter courses don't really make you a very safe driver, and you'll have to work a lot out for yourself once behind the wheel. This often translates into you having to spend inordinate amounts of time planning lessons and thinking up activities to keep students busy, which can massively eat into the free time you would usually set aside for getting to know new people and surroundings.</p> <p>There is a great deal of confusion between the definition of ELT courses - such as Tesol and Celta - which can be a barrier to knowing what you should be looking for. </p> <p>Any course aimed at training you how to teach English as a foreign language can be referred to as a Tefl course. The two most internationally referred to qualifications are the Cambridge Celta and Trinity CertTesol. These are often employers' favourite Tefl courses. Others, particularly those with similar course content, duration and hours of teaching practice are also good, viable options. If you are unsure, though, it's worth conducting some research, in terms of the course content and reputation a given course enjoys among the schools that might employ you. </p> <p>The reason why so many people single out the Cambridge and Trinity qualifications is the worldwide reach these examination bodies enjoy. The name Cambridge is particularly strong overseas. The crucial factor for both exam boards is that each of their courses, wherever in the world they are run, is visited by an external assessor (Cambridge) or moderator (Trinity). Their job is to check that tutors are following the strict syllabus and are coming up with the goods, that trainees' coursework and teaching is up to scratch and that the grades being awarded are appropriate. Some of the providers of equivalent courses also provide their own cross validation, which helps to ensure consistency.</p> <p>Others, however, feel obliged to come up with similar forms of approval and accreditation. Some of these will be genuinely beneficial, others more spurious. One misleading ruse is to become corporate members of teaching and training bodies. While membership of these is of interest, it's a red herring in terms of any sort of quality certificate.</p> <p>Beyond the pedagogical arguments for taking a quality course, most would-be teachers' prime concern is \"will my course will land me a Tefl job in my chosen country\".</p> <p>In practically every country you'll find the full gamut of recruitment criteria being employed by schools to take on English teachers. This ranges overseas British Council schools, which only consider applications from teachers with a Celta/CertTesol qualification, or close equivalent, and two to three years' experience, to other operations that will take a completely unqualified teacher with no experience, where it's sufficient simply to be a native speaker.</p> <p>It's wrong to infer from this that the higher the level of Tefl certification a school demands, the better that school will be (or the more they will pay you). It usually comes down to more human factors, such as the experiences the recruiter has had with previous teachers, his/her general awareness of the courses available and the importance placed on the Tefl course as opposed to other factors, such as personality, presentation, other work experience and academic qualifications. The more substantial the Tefl qualification you possess, the more opportunities you have, but the best job might not be in a school with the highest expectations. </p> <p>In preparation for a Tefl career leap, therefore, it's vital to carry out some good desk research and talk to as many people as possible so you start out with a realistic picture of the opportunities each type of course might give you in your target country. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For more information on choosing a quality course, contact Cactus TEFL. info@cactustefl.com or visit the <a href=\"http://www.cactustefl.com\" target_new\">website</a>, or telephone 0845 130 4775 (UK local rate) or +44 1273 725200 from outside the UK.</p>",
  "<p>There have been specialist schools in business, in science and sports. But today, the first \"community academy\" was announced, with a philosophy to \"instill a sense of community responsibility\" in all pupils.</p> <p>A London location is yet to be confirmed, but its sponsor, the millionaire property mogul and chairman of an NSPCC campaign against child abuse, Andrew Rosenfeld, said he hoped the new style school would become a blueprint for others. </p> <p>Academy sponsors donate \u00a32m and the government adds up to \u00a322m to meet the cost of replacing a failing school with a new one. In return, the sponsor gets overall control of the school's governing body and extra freedom from regulation to run the school as they please.</p> <p>The idea behind the community academy is to pull together existing government programmes, such as Sure Start and extended schools, to provide adult learning, health and social care facilities, and childcare. </p> <p>A pupil might arrive for breakfast, have a health check in the afternoon and stay on for an after school club while their parents take an evening class - all on one site. </p> <p>Meanwhile, students would learn through the curriculum about society and community and how to give something back to it.</p> <p>Mr Rosenfeld said: \"I am very concerned about the way the next generation is moving, where people are judged by material belongings, rather than who they are and what their contribution to life is. I am very keen to try and change that balance. </p> <p>He added: \"Young people in this country have, in my view, reached a crossroads, living as we do in an increasingly materialistic and, some would say, superficial society. People are judged on what they take out of society rather than what they put back. The aim of this academy is to put social welfare and community responsibility at the forefront of the schools curriculum and to instil within pupils the idea that a commitment to others and a sense of community and family is every bit as important as academic and financial success.\" Mr Rosenfeld is chairman of the Full Stop campaign run by the children's charity the NSPCC, which aims to end cruelty to children. He is also chief executive of Minerva plc, a property company he founded in 1988.</p> <p>This month, five new academies were announced, taking the total to 17. Over the next five years, the government wants 200 to be up and running, or in development, to replace the worse failing schools.</p>",
  "<p>Let me say first of all, the thoughts of everyone at this conference are with Ken Bigley and all his brave family. And all of us here - and I believe everyone throughout the country - will give and must give in these difficult times Tony Blair our full support. </p> <p>Conference, I come here, after seven years as your Labour Chancellor, not just to tell you that we have done but to tell you how much more we have yet to do. </p> <p>And I come to this conference after seven years of this New Labour government more idealistic than ever, more determined and more certain than ever about what it is our duty to achieve for Britain. '</p> <p>No longer the most inflation prone economy, with New Labour, Britain today has the lowest inflation for thirty years. </p> <p>No longer the boom-bust economy, Britain has had the lowest interest rates for forty years. </p> <p>And no longer the stop-go economy, Britain is now enjoying the longest period of sustained economic growth for 200 years.</p> <p>And no longer the country of mass unemployment, Britain is now advancing further and faster towards full employment than at any time in our lives.</p> <p>And after decades of underinvestment, investment in schools is doubling, in policing doubling, in transport doubling, in housing doubling, and instead of \u00a340 billion spent on the NHS in 1997, by 2008 \u00a3110 billion for the NHS. </p> <p>From being the party not trusted with the economy, this conference should be proud that Labour is today the only party trusted with the economy. </p> <p>But for me, for us the Labour party, and for the country, this is not enough. </p> <p>We have created 1.8 million jobs. But for us, the Labour party, this is not enough.</p> <p>We have lifted one million children and more than one million pensioners out of poverty. But we must do more.</p> <p>We have introduced the minimum wage and raised it by 35 per cent to make work pay. But we will do more.</p> <p>We have created one million child care places. But we will go further. </p> <p>Economic stability and new incentives have helped create 300,000 new businesses. But that is not enough. </p> <p>We will not rest until millions denied opportunity can achieve their aspirations and until the three million children living in poverty are growing up in a Britain where child poverty has been eradicated for good.</p> <p>We will not rest until Britain's public services - starved for two decades, now being rebuilt - are reformed and renewed, an example to the world and the collective pride of our nation. </p> <p>We will not rest until enterprise is open to all, creating hundreds more businesses in every community, and where the millions of men and women - some lone parents, some on incapacity benefit - who want to work will have the right to work, in a Britain where there is full employment in every region and every nation of our country. </p> <p>In the last seven years we have started to win the argument, our party's argument, that you will never build a successful economy by writing off the talents of the unemployed.</p> <p>That you will never build stability through the stop go, quick fixes of the past but - as with reforming the Bank of England - only through planning for the long term. </p> <p>And we are winning the argument too that we must have low inflation to create growth, responsibilities in the new deal to create jobs, that more competition is essential to create prosperity and that private and public sectors must work together to create investment. </p> <p>And with sustained public support for our decision to raise national insurance to pay for our reforms in the NHS, we are winning the argument that the way to fund and provide health care is not private insurance which insures only some of the people some of the time but national insurance which is insuring all of the people all of the time. </p> <p>And we are showing - and we will honour, as Tony Blair has said, the agreement at Warwick - that by guaranteeing a minimum wage and proper rights at work that the modern route to prosperity is not exploitation in the workplace but fairness in the workplace.</p> <p>And we are showing that through tax credits now paid to 6 million hard working families we can make work pay and reduce family poverty. </p> <p>I believe that we have shown that when we make a compelling case and trust the progressive instincts of the British people we can build a shared sense of national purpose, we can build a progressive consensus that inspires the country, a consensus that prosperity and justice for all can advance together. </p> <p>I tell this conference, for me, for this party and for this country, our achievements of the last seven years, important as they are, are not enough.</p> <p>As British citizens, Labour party members, as parents we are called to ask: what kind of Britain would we be proud to hand on to our children and grandchildren.</p> <p>A great Britain of aspiration and ambition where there are no barriers to achievement, no ceilings on talent, no cap on success and where the common sense of the age is that not just a few but everyone has the chance to fulfil their dreams and potential: that opportunity in education, in business, in culture and in leisure is genuinely equal and open not just for those born into wealth and privilege but for all. </p> <p>A Great Britain where people say with pride, </p> <p>'This is our country, Great Britain; we built it generation to generation upon the foundation of liberty duty and fairness; </p> <p>'We are enriching it, extending new opportunities to all;</p> <p>'A Britain where - because we recognise our shared needs, mutual obligations and linked destinies - it is not every man for himself not them against us, but we the people working together for a better life future for all'. </p> <p>A patriotic vision </p> <p>learning from but different from America whom I admire for its enterprise but where - with 45 million without health insurance - great economic success is not matched by great social justice; </p> <p>learning from but different from the rest of Europe which has greater social cohesion but where, with 19 million out of work, that social cohesion is not matched by economic dynamism.</p> <p>Our mission for Britain is both prosperity and justice for all. </p> <p>And in our generation, I want us to build a shared national purpose, a British progressive consensus, much more than a set of individual policies announced by politicians but a set of beliefs that come to be shared by the British people - that Britain can lead by example as the first country of the global age where prosperity and justice advance together.</p> <p>Our task therefore is not to consolidate the politics we inherited but by our words and deeds to transform people's view of what in our country is possible.</p> <p>To seek to win not just votes but hearts and minds to a shared national purpose - far beyond the ranks of our party or any party.</p> <p>And today we have to realise this vision amidst a profound set of economic changes unparalleled in our economic history which we can only meet by a unity of purpose together.</p> <p>If only seven years ago there was no DVD, no digital TV, no broadband, a fraction of people with mobile phones or connected to the internet, then think of how in the next few years ever faster changes in digital technologies and genetics will touch upon every aspect of our lives and revolutionise our economy. </p> <p>And we face these dramatic changes when developing countries are now rising to become world manufacturing centres. competition fiercer than ever because India pays its workers just \u00a318 a week, China \u00a317, Philippines less than \u00a317; China now exporting more than France, Italy and Britain; China and India now producing 4 million graduates every year. </p> <p>But when people ask: whether in the face of this new global market in labour, capital, and goods we can still aspire to be the country which is not just for a few but for all of our children the greatest place to grow up in; whether we can still be a country where we can advance to full employment and where not just a few but all our young people can make the most of their talents; whether we can still hold fast to our vision of Britain, I say: in the face of these challenges, the future lies not in abandoning our vision of a Britain of opportunity for all - but making it come alive for our time. Ours is a vision that works for Britain not in spite of our Labour values, but as I said last year, because of our Labour values. </p> <p>For just as it will be the nations that fail to open up opportunity, get the best out of their people, fail to tap the potential of all their citizens that will rapidly fall behind, so it is also true that the countries that will succeed best in the global economy will be those that bring out the best talents of all no matter their birth, race, sex or background.</p> <p>And my message to the country is that Britain will succeed best by showing the ingenuity, talents, dynamism, creativity and inventiveness of all our people are second to none. </p> <p>But to those who say there should be no change without security, I tell you honestly: there can be no security without change.</p> <p>And it is because nations will rise and fall at speed because no nation can ever now take its future prosperity for granted, and the race will be won by the skilled, the flexible, the enterprising and the creative that in the budget and pre budget report we will tackle one by one barrier by barrier the economic obstacles that hold us as a country back.</p> <p>Our success depends first upon entrenching our hard won stability. </p> <p>Facing a global recovery that is uneven and still fragile, where oil prices have doubled and imbalances have worsened, I will tell the G7 and IMF when I travel to Washington later this week that we will take no risks with inflationary pay deals, and from this Chancellor and this party no short-termism, no easy options, no irresponsible pre election promises.</p> <p>We will never be complacent about stability. We must show at all times we have the discipline and strength to take the tough long term fiscal and monetary decisions for Britain. because, with the economy central to people's concerns at this next election as at every election, that is the way to entrench and retain the trust of the people on the economy and pay for the much needed reforms and investments in public services. </p> <p>And we must seize not squander the opportunities our stability now offers us. And in the pre budget report I will not disguise the scale of the long term scientific, technological, trade, environmental and social changes that every industrial economy now has to make.</p> <p>Expanding our ten year science plan, so that we can be proud that new British ideas and inventions are turned into new British products, new British exports, that in turn create new British manufacturing jobs.</p> <p>And expanding the R&amp;D tax credit, most of which will go to manufacturing investment allowances, most to manufacturing, regional venture capital funds, much to manufacturing, and implementing the new regional manufacturing strategies agreed at Warwick we will prove to the world that in the new global economy far from manufacturing being a relic of the industrial revolution we will build in British factories from aerospace to pharmaceuticals, from engineering to fashion, in hardware and in software, a Britain of modern manufacturing strength. </p> <p>Through stability and tax incentives and infrastructure, and by cutting red tape and planning delays, we want to see, in every community, enterprise flourish and John Prescott and I plan to do more to ensure that when local councils become ambassadors for new business creation and support schools and colleges promoting enterprise, councils get the benefit of new business not just in new jobs but the benefit of the n new business rates income that can pay for better local services. </p> <p>And because affordable housing is the key to personal prosperity for millions, John Prescott and I will implement the barker review with new plans to bring homes within the reach of first time buyers, including expanding affordable housing for key workers in our public services.</p> <p>China and India's wages are just five per cent of ours, but I say to you: we will not compete by lowering our wages or lowering standards but by raising our skills. and so we will, at the coming election, make a historic promise: by moving beyond the voluntarist system of training that has failed, by extending nationwide our employer training pilots, Charles Clarke and I will make a reality of a second chance in education for all, for the first time guaranteeing to every single member of the workforce and every unemployed man and women who is without basic skills, the resources and the learning facilities to acquire the skills they need, giving them the choices they need to make the most of their talents. </p> <p>And I want us to make a promise to all those over 16 in work or at school or colleges: for 16 and 17 year olds for the first time a New Labour guarantee of a minimum wage from the age of 16.</p> <p>And by extending our education maintenance allowances, ending the injustice of teenagers in our poorest communities forced by family circumstance to leave school early even when they wanted to stay on, ensuring whatever your means or family background you can now stay on and fulfil your potential.</p> <p>And when some claim it is wrong to set a target so that 50 per cent of our young people can enjoy higher education, telling us that more means worse, let us tell them what would be wrong is to put a cap on aspiration when today just 15 per cent of children from poorest families get to university - and when countries from America to Taiwan and Korea are moving towards 60 per cent and then 70 per cent, understanding aspiration is not a luxury it is an imperative.</p> <p>And if we are to meet the global economic challenge, skills must be matched by flexibility and there will be no room for the old British complacency, or the old battles between public and private sectors - which must work together. So I tell you honestly the public sector reform agenda - more flexibility, accountability and personalisation will not stall but be stepped up; we will go ahead with our civil service reforms; and if the government had \u00a322 billion to spend it will not be for an expensive re-nationalisation. We will put investment in schools and hospitals first.</p> <p>It is simply wrong that people who lose their jobs can lose their pensions too, so in partnership with the trade unions we have set up the new pension protection fund, and for pension funds that have previously gone bust we have already put aside \u00a3400 million. I tell you we will work with the unions to do what it takes to tackle the gross injustice of workers who through no fault of their own find their pensions have been destroyed. </p> <p>I say to this conference: having adopted the New Labour policies - minimum income guarantee, the pension credit, the winter fuel payment, the state second pension - and cleared up the scandal of Tory pension mis-selling, and as Alan Johnson will say later in this debate, we will also respond to the new pension commission by doing what it takes to make sure that all workers can have security and dignity in retirement. </p> <p>A Britain of prosperity and justice will continue to promote competition, liberalisation and reform to strengthen not just the economy of Britain but of Europe, because as pro-Europeans committed to the progress of the European Union we know that in the years to come the test that the British people will apply to Europe is that it embraces reform, resists federal fiscal policies, rejects tax harmonisation, and tackles, root and branch, the waste and excesses of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p> <p>Here in Britain we seek to build a new progressive consensus not only in a new world of economic change but also of social change and new aspirations. </p> <p>I'll tell you where now and in the next Parliament we can be pioneers for justice. I'll tell you where the front line is in the battle against unfairness. I'll tell you the new frontier for social change in our country. </p> <p>When I look at over fifty years of the welfare state - and see:</p> <p>How little we in Britain have advanced towards equal pay;</p> <p>What little we have done for maternity rights;</p> <p>What little for child care;</p> <p>How much we still have to do to end centuries of discrimination against women in work and at home; </p> <p>How far we still have to go to eradicate child and family poverty;</p> <p>I know that it was a scandal that before 1997 it was our country - Britain - that did least in Europe and as a result wasted the potential and talents of millions. </p> <p>And in the year 2004 we still cannot be satisfied as long a poor child is still three times more likely to die before the age of one than someone born to privilege. We cannot relax when we know that the time from the cradle to the nursery school - the time that does most to determine life chances - is also the time when we offer mothers and fathers the least.</p> <p>So as Patricia Hewitt has said we will now set as a goal for the next term, a total of twelve months paid parental leave giving parents more choice to stay at home for the first year of their child's life.</p> <p>We will set up a commission on the gender pay gap and review the right for parents to request flexible working, because we have not yet done enough and we must do more.</p> <p>And - in children's services - embracing diversity of provision, extending the range of effective choice, and working with charity, voluntary and private providers, the Pre Budget Report will, with Charles Clarke, set out a plan for high quality affordable child care for all and nursery education more suited to parents needs.</p> <p>And with every school offering extended opening, and at the heart of every community a Children's Centre, a centre for childcare, health and education, this is the next stage of public serviced reform, the next stage of extending opportunity in our universal welfare state. </p> <p>And because we want high quality childcare and children's services that in every area - as Sure Start has shown - listen to and meet the needs of children and parents, in the Pre Budget Report we are going to encourage and sponsor local forums up and down the country to listen to parents so that their voices are heard and their needs come first. </p> <p>It is through extending tax credits - as the Burns family said this morning - that we will we meet our 2004 target to reduce child poverty by one quarter, and we must now advance to our next goal which is even more ambitious: to halve child poverty by 2010. </p> <p>In this party we believe one child in poverty impoverishes us all. But let us face the fact that we need to win more people to this cause. </p> <p>So in every constituency we, the Labour party, must reach out beyond the Labour party, and reach out to voluntary charitable and community groups, reach out to every neighbourhood and build a progressive consensus that every child having the best start in life is the obligation this generation owes and will discharge to the next. </p> <p>So our task is nothing less than building and sustaining a shared national purpose, the British progressive consensus, that no child in Britain is left behind and that our future lies not in two nations ever more divided by inequality but in one nation united in prosperity for all. </p> <p>And how do we build and sustain this shared national purpose?</p> <p>Look back on previous governments - </p> <p>Great achievements, landmark reforms</p> <p>Many that stood the test not just of one parliament but the test of generations. </p> <p>And in their time they sought to build a progressive consensus - the shared national unity of purpose essential for their ideas to endure so that no future government, no matter how different, was able to undo their reforms. </p> <p>But we must ask ourselves why even for the historic 1906 and 1945 governments that after a few years the momentum that sustained them forward stalled, and that while the initiatives continued the impulse that supported change dimmed. </p> <p>And there are two lessons we must learn.</p> <p>First, even that great 1945 Labour government was undermined by economic failure. So let me say honestly to the party and the country that in meeting the long term challenges ahead we must and will take no risks with the long term policies for stability and prudence I have and I will set out. </p> <p>And the second lesson is that they failed to go out and deepen popular support for the next stage of their advance. </p> <p>And instead of sustaining a progressive consensus in the country they failed even to sustain a consensus among themselves.</p> <p>And so all of us must do whatever we can to ensure that we build the unity of purpose that this country needs by ensuring the strength of our unity of purpose in this party.</p> <p>So I tell you that as a Party we must do more to learn the lessons of the past. </p> <p>We must show we are rooted in our communities not remote from them.</p> <p>Instead of retreating to being administrators for our policies we must also become evangelists for them.</p> <p>And I know that I and all of us must do more if the Labour party's aspirations for Britain are to continue to be the British peoples aspirations for Britain and if we are to build and sustain that progressive consensus,</p> <p>We must reach out to people in new ways within and beyond the Labour party;</p> <p>Reinvigorate elected local government;</p> <p>Be open and transparent by reforming undemocratic institutions;</p> <p>And - united as a party around our long term vision - unite the country around our vision showing by what we do every day that the true purpose of politics is to serve your country. </p> <p>And the big idea is that we will build and sustain a progressive consensus in our country for a Britain of prosperity and justice for all, a progressive consensus that the British people want to prevent any future government from undoing. </p> <p>And so, I want everyone in this party to share in this ambition: for the first time in our party's history, a third term Labour government, creating that progressive consensus.</p> <p>And this matters not just to us here in the Labour party or in Britain but far wider than that - to all countries especially developing countries seeking also to build economic prosperity and social justice for their people.</p> <p>In 2000 the whole world came together to make a solemn promise for 2015, the millennium development goals:</p> <p>the promise of primary education for every child;</p> <p>the promise of an end to avoidable infant and maternal deaths;</p> <p>the promise of a halving of poverty.</p> <p>But on current rates of progress, in Sub-Saharan Africa:</p> <p>The promise of primary education for all will be delivered not in 2015, but 2130, 115 years too late;</p> <p>The promise for the halving of poverty not by 2015, but 2150, 135 years too late; </p> <p>And the promise of cutting infant deaths not by 2015 but by 2165, 150 years too late. </p> <p>And I say:</p> <p>150 years is too long for a people to wait for justice;</p> <p>150 years is too long to wait when infants are dying in Africa when there are medicines in the rest of the world to heal them; </p> <p>150 years is too long to wait for promises to be redeemed and a bond of trust to be honoured; </p> <p>150 years is too long to wait when all the world lacks is the will to act.</p> <p>So I am proud that it is because of the work of Labour party members and the votes of Labour supporters that will allow me and Hilary Benn to travel as a Labour Chancellor, your representative, to go this week to Washington, and at the annual IMF, G7 and World Bank meetings and, with Jack Straw, make the case for our unique Labour proposals, as we work together to make poverty history. </p> <p>That if the poorest countries draw up their anti-poverty programmes to open up trade and investment, and tackle corruption, we the richest countries will through an international finance facility ensure we honour the timetable to reach 0.7 per cent of GDP and for the first time plan \u00a350 billion more - to act against debt, disease, illiteracy, Aids and poverty. </p> <p>But the contribution we can make is more than money.</p> <p>It is the inspiration that comes from Britain leading by example by combining prosperity with justice. </p> <p>If, as I said to you last year, we from here in Britain cannot win the battle for an NHS free at the point of need funded from taxation not charges then what hope is there for Africa - where the poor cannot afford to pay for even the most basic health care and where the only hope of tackling disease, illness and Aids is a health service free to all based on need not ability to pay.</p> <p>But it is more than that: if we cannot show in Britain that state schooling free of charge is the best way forward for children then what hope is there for Africa or for the developing world - where the only hope for the 120 million children denied schooling is not paying for education but free education.</p> <p>But if we can show a publicly funded health service free at the point of need delivers to all the people,</p> <p>If we can show modern state schooling free of charge is the best hope for all children,</p> <p>If we can show the ethic of public service is so strong that public services can provide efficiently for all people without having to privatise or charge,</p> <p>if we can show that here in Britain we can create not just a programme for prosperity and justice but a popular movement that says in clear unequivocal terms that it is prosperity and justice by which the British people want to be defined to the world,</p> <p>If we can show that when politics succeeds jobs are created, health improves, opportunity blossoms, and people flourish, </p> <p>Then what a difference our country can make to our world.</p> <p>I have seen this ethic of public service at work;</p> <p>I have seen doctors and nurses who show not only exceptional skill and professionalism but extraordinary care and friendship; </p> <p>carers whose unbelievable compassion and support can transform despair into hope;</p> <p>home helps and support staff whose dedication, commitment and humanity show that there are values far beyond those of contracts, markets and exchange and that public service can be a calling and not just a career.</p> <p>The ethic of public service summed up best in poetry: </p> <p>\"It is the hands of others who grow the food we eat, who sew the clothes we wear, who build the houses we inhabit; </p> <p>\"It is the hands of others who tend us when we're sick and lift us up when we fall;</p> <p>\"It is the hands of others who bring us into the world and who lower us into the earth.\"</p> <p>So we are not isolated individuals but we depend on each other.</p> <p>It is by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more together than we achieve alone.</p> <p>It is by the strong helping the weak that we are all made stronger.</p> <p>And in those famous words, while the arc of the moral universe is long, it bends towards justice.</p> <p>So have confidence in our values.</p> <p>Have confidence united in our values we will build the progressive consensus of prosperity and justice for all. </p> <p>Have confidence our achievements are just a beginning: we have much more to do.</p>",
  "We've heard a lot recently about how true believing Blairites want Tony to stay on as prime minister to push forward a \"radical\" manifesto. For radical, read \"market-orientated\" with more consumer choice in public services. <p>But now, from Tessa Jowell, undoubtedly a very true believer, comes an unexpected new pitch, firmly against too much market power and calling for a \"conversational democracy\" in which ministers are ready to be more open and apologetic about their failures. </p> <p>Jowell says Labour must treat people less as consumers and more as citizens: \"A model of public service improvement that sees people only in market terms misses a large part of the story. The great risk is we cede energy to political interest groups and minority parties.\" </p> <p>Jowell warms to her theme: by simply treating voters as consumers, \"we will miss the opportunity to build a better kind of society\". She argues that progressive taxation will be part of the deal and, in a rare admission of Blairite fallibility, that the government has to change the way it engages with voters. </p> <p>\"We need a conversational democracy _ It is absolutely essential that the 'big conversation' is not just a short-term statement. It's the way to rebuild trust and confidence.\" </p> <p>In the most dramatic call for a new start among leading Blairites, she goes on: \"Between now and the election, there must be a crusade for a new kind of decent politics - of trust and engagement, seeing people as an asset. We must be willing to listen, willing to admit mistakes and willing to change. This is a profound challenge to the old 'command and control' approach to politics.\" </p> <p>Had this kind of language come from a Brownite minister, it would have led to cries of split and provocation. But Jowell isn't peeling away from Blair. Asked about the now-famous spring wobble, she says she \"and lots of the people who feel close to the PM, support him, believe what he is doing, rallied round\". </p> <p>\"Things were difficult; it was awful seeing the photos from Abu Ghraib, and the sense that the situation in Iraq appeared not to be moving forward. What I did, and what others did is to make it absolutely clear that we were all in this together - we had all supported this course of action, and he ought not to feel isolated. But he was never talking about resigning.\" </p> <p>Will he go on and on, I ask? \"If we are elected for a third term, led by Tony as the prime minister, then he will serve for a full term; yes, I do believe that.\" </p> <p>This doesn't sound good news for the chancellor, but she says of Gordon Brown, \"I expect he will be prime minister one day\", and that she's always expressed her admiration for him. Pressed on the possible contest between him and Alan Milburn (\"I'm a huge fan of Alan's\") she says it's all wildly speculative. There will be no vacancy for prime minister \"in the foreseeable future\". </p> <p>This, good Westminster hothouse fun though it is, begs the question of what a third-term Blair government might be like. That's what this conference will be for, Jowell believes: \"We will not be re-elected because of what we've achieved, but we will be re-elected if we give people a convincing picture of the future we want to create.\" </p> <p>As a \"really important conference for the third term\" it won't see lots of splits and dramas, she confidently predicts, though not without a wry laugh. </p> <p>\"All the parties to whatever splits may be imagined or real accept that we're one party; it's a privilege not a right to be in government. Together, our political creativity can continue to transform people's lives.\" </p> <p>The Jowell conference message is the need to recapture the idea of \"the public realm\" as something deeper than mere consumerism. Her critique of the limits of the market would delight Brownites; but it has emerged through her work on culture, the media and sport. </p> <p>\"I would define the contemporary public realm as including our galleries, our museums, local libraries, parks, the BBC and public service broadcasting, the lottery and so on. These are institutions that give rise to common experience and shape not just our personal identity but also our national identity. </p> <p>\"The British Museum and the National Gallery were created not for public benefit but as a way of enhancing citizenship, and in these public institutions, just as in our parks, or as a listener or a viewer of the BBC, we are all equal citizens. And that is why the market analogy breaks down in this area.\" </p> <p>She wants this week's conference \"to focus on what we share in common _ on citizenship rather than consumerism as a way of building on the achievements of the first two terms\". </p> <p>This could be the beginning of a Blairite case for progressive taxation, and more engagement by the middle classes: \"If you're acting as a citizen rather than as a consumer, you have to be willing to give up something in order to achieve an objective you hold to be personally and socially valuable. </p> <p>There's no point, for instance, saying you'd like a better health service and more policemen on the streets if you're not also prepared to pay for them.\" It isn't only money. She cites the \"huge voluntary army\" of school governors, and the 31,000 responses to her consultation on the future of the BBC as examples of the engagement of real citizens. </p> <p>I'm not sure about this. Hasn't there been a great falling away of the public realm since the Thatcher era, the closure of libraries, the disappearance of park keepers, and a move towards ever more consumerism? </p> <p>Jowell disagrees, citing enthusiasm for the Olympic bid, a recent fun run in London that attracted 22,000 women, and the queues round the corner to see the latest exhibition at the National Gallery. \"There is a hunger for this, as moments of national celebration show _ it is part of a civic tradition in towns and cities right round the country.\" </p> <p>There is no doubt that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport gets some of the most enjoyable parts of the public realm to think about. There is no doubt either that this particular culture secretary will be with Blair in the last trench. </p> <p>But when it comes to the complaint that the Blairites simply want more privatisation, Tessa Jowell has a more thoughtful response than some. </p> <p>As to her prediction of a serious, thoughtful conference, without splits or dramas? We'll see. </p>",
  "Labour's conference is expected to vote today in favour of renationalising the rail industry despite opposition from Tony Blair and lobbying from ministers. <p>Supporting public ownership would be the third reversal in two days for the party's leadership after yesterday's defeat on council housing and the decision by constituency delegates to debate and vote on the Iraq war. </p> <p>The leadership of the white-collar Transport Salaried Staffs' Association appeared to be holding out last night against pressure to withdraw a key amendment to a policy document.The call for an \"integrated, accountable and publicly owned railway\" would, if carried, be inserted into Labour's draft manifesto despite Mr Blair's resistance. </p> <p>The likely commitment comes less than a week after the prime minister stood with Richard Branson to launch Virgin rail services and nine years after he dropped clause four of the party's constitution which commited it to common ownership. </p> <p>Under the scheme advocated by the TSSA, track and station operator Network Rail would be brought under full public control, franchises ended when they run out and rolling stock leasing companies renationalised. </p> <p>The small union, which is backed by Unison, the T&amp;G and GMB, argued the policy would be popular with the electorate as it published a YouGov internet poll showing 67% of people believe passenger rail services should be run in the public sector. In a briefing note for conference delegates, the TSSA argued that taxpayers got poor value for money from the railway. </p> <p>Last year the private train operating companies received more than \u00a32bn in public subsidy, compared with \u00a31.5bn in 1993-94 at current prices. </p> <p>Of the 28 publicly subsidised franchises, just seven pay money back into the public purse via the Strategic Rail Authority. Gerry Doherty, the TSSA's general secretary, said: \"This is an issue which resonates and is popular with the public. We want Labour to win a third term: to do this it needs bold, popular policies which it can sell on the doorstep. </p> <p>\"Public ownership for the railways is just such a policy.\"</p>",
  "Tony Blair last night lost the first round of his battle to refocus Labour's energies on a vote-winning domestic agenda when the party conference in Brighton backed calls for an emergency debate on Iraq, the most divisive controversy of his premiership. <p>Unless party managers can broker a compromise resolution it could result in an embarrassing defeat when delegates vote on Thursday - the day of the important Hartlepool byelection - and some urge the early recall of British troops. </p> <p>Labour's 2004 conference, overshadowed by the uncertainty about the fate of the British hostage Kenneth Bigley and heavily protected against assorted protests, began in a sombre mood - and stayed so. </p> <p>As partisans on both sides of the Blair-Brown divide over policy and leadership initially demonstrated public restraint in their comments, the chan cellor and his allies were last night signalling renewed impatience with the current thrust of election planning. </p> <p>In an article in today's Guardian, Ed Balls, the chancellor's righthand man, attacks demands for \"a more radical third term\" - shorthand for Alan Milburn, Mr Blair's new campaign strategist - as proof of debilitating pessimism. </p> <p>\"Don't get me wrong - we do need to debate radical policies for our manifesto. But the idea that the only way to have radical policies for the third term is by renouncing much of the last seven years is not an opportunity for our party but a serious mistake,\" writes Mr Balls, now Labour candidate for Normanton. </p> <p>Mr Blair was busy meeting delegates, determined to reinforce his position, and buttressed by cabinet allies who believe he remains Labour's crucial asset. </p> <p>Last night he risked a live, televised Q&amp;A session with activists. Rejecting claims that he considered quitting this spring, he earlier declared: \"I'm not the wobbling sort.\" His heir apparent, Gordon Brown, looks set to give the conference a coded version of the Balls message when he makes his speech on the economy in Brighton today and stresses the centrality of his own record in office to Labour's re-election hopes. </p> <p>In extracts from today's speech, released last night, the chancellor says that \"Labour is today the only party trusted with the economy\" and promises not to let inflationary pay deals, short-termism or \"irresponsible pre-election promises\" undermine that trust. </p> <p>Mr Blair, Mr Milburn and other senior colleagues were making similar pledges on the Sussex shore yesterday and praising Mr Brown's achievements - \"lowest interest rates for 30 years, the lowest inflation for 40 years, the longest period of sustained economic growth for 200 years\" as the chancellor himself put it. </p> <p>But they want Labour's third term manifesto to look forward, stressing wider con sumer choice in public services such as schools and hospitals - for too long the prerogative of the rich, Mr Milburn said yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Brown is suspicious of both the goal and some of No 10's chosen policies to implement choice. </p> <p>Though aides stressed that his will be \"a unifying message\" - unlike last year's pointedly \"Real Labour\" conference speech - some MPs and observers saw provocation in one prominent passage. </p> <p>\"Our objective is prosperity and justice for all. In our generation I want us to build a shared national purpose for Britain, a progressive consensus. </p> <p>\"Much more than a set of individual policies announced by politicians, a set of beliefs that can be shared by the British people, that Britain can lead by example as the first country in a global age where prosperity and justice advance together.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair made his ritual pre-conference appearance on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost where he acknowledged mistakes over Iraq, but refused to apologise for removing Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>He tried to emphasise an upbeat domestic agenda, and all the plans he still nurses. </p> <p>With three mixed polls published yesterday - one in the News of the World putting the Tories ahead by 32% to 29% for the Lib Dems and Labour on 28% - it was a struggle. </p> <p>The Observer's Mori poll put Labour second on 32%, one percentage point behind the Tories, with the Lib Dems on 25%. Another poll reported Mr Blair to be as \"out of touch\" (63%) and \"inflexible\" (57%) as Margaret Thatcher before her fall. </p> <p>In addition to the vote by constituency activists to make Iraq one of the week's five \"contemporary\" - or emergency - motions, to be debated and voted on on Thurs day after a text has been agreed, delegates voted to defy the platform on council house sales. If accepted into the manifesto it would allow councils to retain control of housing stock and borrow to repair it, rather than be routinely encouraged to transfer homes to arms-length bodies. </p> <p>Today the unions look set to flex their muscles by insisting on a pledge to renationalise Network Rail and, eventually, the train operating companies too. Ministers will resist that. </p> <p>Mr Blair told David Frost he will highlight issues such as asylum, drugs, crime and reform of the education system. \"I'm restless to do more and to do better. I think we have done a good job for the country ... but there's more to do.\" </p> <p>But, in a forlorn attempt to stop what he called the endless media \"soap opera\" about the leadership, he said: \"You don't do deals about this job.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair also refused to confirm he will back Mr Brown, saying he had done so before. </p>",
  "It was two hours after Olympic Airways flight 411's takeoff from Athens that an anonymous man telephoned a Greek newspaper and said calmly that a bomb was on board. <p>The 301 passengers had settled down for what should have been a routine 10-hour flight to New York. The airliner had left Athens at 12.15pm local time, an hour ahead of British Summer Time.</p> <p>All passengers and baggage had been carefully screened, and the jet checked by police and sniffer dogs, under security measures introduced for the Olympics last month. The Paralympic Games are still under way in Athens and a strict security regime is in place at its new airport.</p> <p>But at 2.15pm, the popular daily Ethnos (Nation) received a call from an anonymous caller, apparently a native Greek speaker, with a short but terrifying message: \"Flight 411 Olympic for America has a bomb for Iraq.\"</p> <p>Soon afterwards, said Calliopi Anesti, a staff member, \"We received two other calls from somebody who spoke very broken Greek saying, 'Bomb, Olympics, America - the Americans will soon see.'\"</p> <p>The newspaper contacted the police. Greek authorities swung into action. By the time the warning reached the pilot, the plane was already in British air space. In shock, the pilot contacted air traffic controllers at Swanwick for help.</p> <p>Under a special communications system, they alerted RAF strike command at High Wycombe, headed by the air chief marshal Sir Brian Burridge. He would then have alerted General Sir Michael Walker, chief of the defence staff, who would have contacted Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary.</p> <p>Within minutes of the warning, two Tornado F3 air defence fighters were scrambled from East Anglia - part of the Quick Reaction Alert Team set up soon after the September 11 attacks on the US.</p> <p>The jets are kept on permanent \"quick readiness alert\" to escort or intercept aircraft in a potential emergency. They escorted the airliner, which was ordered to divert to Stansted.</p> <p>There was little the fighters could do to save the passengers and 11 crew if there was, as claimed, a bomb on board. The real question was whether the aircraft could pose a threat to others. Had the jet been hijacked, the Tornados could have been ordered shoot it down - but only on the prime minister's authority.</p> <p>At Stansted, matters were developing just as fast. The airport has become used to security alerts, dealing with at least three hijackings in recent decades.</p> <p>The secluded area at the end of its runway is ideal for emergency landings - well away from the terminal buildings and easily approachable by the armed forces if a plane may need to be stormed.</p> <p>As a result, its staff and emergency services have built up an expertise in dealing with emergencies. Those practised procedures were put into place as news of the impending arrival emerged, with airport officials and Essex police implementing \"full emergency conditions\".</p> <p>At 3.25pm BST - about four hours after it took off - the plane touched down on the runway, where fire engines were waiting at a safe distance.</p> <p>The bewildered but otherwise calm passengers were shepherded off the aircraft within minutes and taken to a hostage reception centre. Airport staff reassured them, but were unable to tell them when their journey would continue; nor whether it would be on the same plane.</p> <p>One passenger, Robert San tandrea, a New York fireman who had been involved in the rescue attempts following the September 11 attacks, was one of those evacuated.</p> <p>\"I was praying. I was a little nervous,\" he said. \"But everyone was very calm.\"</p> <p>Skye Ferranti, an artist from Lower Manhattan, said armed police boarded the plane moments after it touched down. \"It was very calm on the plane. Everyone seemed to stay calm until we landed and then the atmosphere changed _ We left our bags either on the Tarmac or the plane and ran towards some coaches that were waiting.\"</p> <p>Security experts say hoax bomb threats are not uncom mon, but the precise nature of this warning caused the full-scale alert. Last night security officials were still investigating whether it was genuine.</p> <p>As dusk fell, a specialist explosives team and its sniffer dogs got ready for a detailed search of the aircraft, while police officers prepared to interview travellers.</p> <p>Essex assistant chief constable Liam Brigginshaw said officers were working methodically to check a \"substantial amount\" of hold baggage and five tonnes of cargo the plane was carrying.</p> <p>\"We are not dealing with anything like a hostage situation or a terrorist attack,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The deputy prime minister's policy of forcing councils to switch their homes to new management has been thrown into disarray after a humiliating defeat at the Labour party conference.</p> <p>Delegates overwhelming backed a resolution stating that tenants should not be financially penalised if they opted to keep their homes under council control.</p> <p>Despite a personal appeal from John Prescott, delegates yesterday voted by a margin of around eight to one against the leadership and in favour of the resolution.</p> <p>It stated: \"Labour will ensure that where tenants chose to remain under the management of their local authority they will not be financially disadvantaged. Funds available for stock transfer will be equally available for councils, ensuring a level playing field.\"</p> <p>To boos from angry delegates, Mr Prescott said the resolution was \"nonsense\" and would cost \u00a35bn to implement. But he conceded that \"public funding of housing does not treat local authorities fairly\".</p> <p>Mr Prescott had insisted that councils would only get extra resources to repair their homes if they hived them off to housing associations, arms length management organisations or private finance initiative consortia. He has repeatedly stated there will be no so-called fourth option of direct investment in council housing.</p> <p>The resolution adopted by the conference will now make it difficult for Mr Prescott and his team to maintain this policy. </p> <p>However, the Labour leadership has already tried to play down its significance, amid confusion over what the party's policy will now be. </p> <p>Ahead of his speech today, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, told reporters: \"I'll make it absolutely clear today that we've announced our public spending plans. There is no extra pre-election giveaway for that [council housing].\"</p> <p>Last week, as SocietyGuardian.co.uk revealed, Mr Prescott met union leaders in an attempt to reach a compromise agreement that would have avoided yesterday's embarrassing defeat. Mr Prescott did agree to allow councils the power to build new homes. But he failed to get the unions and local government leaders to drop the resolution on the management of council housing. </p> <p>According to one source Mr Prescott and Jack Dromey, deputy general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, had a \"stand up row\" over the issue.</p> <p>During the debate on the resolution Mr Dromey accused the government of having an \"ideological bias\" against council housing. </p> <p>He said: \"If the tenants of a well-run, high-performing council following full consultation with the tenants on all options - want direct investment from government, why not?\"</p> <p>Speaking directly to Mr Prescott he said: \"I know you know the current policy is unfair.\"</p> <p>Daniel Zeichner, chairman of the Labour party in the east of England, who moved the resolution, said: \"If debt can be written off for a stock transfer why can't it be written off for the in-house option?\" </p> <p>He added: \"If government money is available for housing associations when they take on negative value estates, why can't if be available for popular, well-performing councils.\" </p> <p>Oona King, the MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, said the government's policy was working. She said: \"Stock transfer gives us more houses for the same amount of government money. We get more families into decent homes faster. Isn't that what socialists want?\"</p> <p>The vote strengthens the bargaining position of Camden council, a well-performing authority, whose tenants have rejected all three of the government's options.</p> <p>Neil Litherland, Camden's director of housing, said, \"Mr Prescott was claiming that only Camden were moaning about this, it's going to be difficult for him to carry on arguing that after a vote like this.\"</p> <p>Alan Walter, from the campaign Defend Council Housing, said: \"Council tenants' opposition to the privatisation of their housing has finally got to the top of the political agenda. Tenants should now be telling local authorities to stop looking at options for new management of their housing, because it's clear that the government will now have to concede the fourth option of direct investment.\"</p>",
  "'Do you have any binoculars?\" \"No.\" \"Waterproofs?\" \"No.\" \"Wellingtons?\" \"No.\" It is an inauspicious start to my plan of spending a day birdwatching with Simon Barnes, but - I hasten to point out - it will at least give him the chance to test out the thesis of his new book: How to Be a Bad Birdwatcher. In it he claims that everybody has the capacity to recognise their local feathered friends and that by learning simply to look out of the window from time to time, we can all have our lives enriched by a little avian appreciation. <p>I'm not so sure. Born and bred in Lewisham, the only bird with which I am truly familiar comes in a cardboard box and is generally succeeded by the word \"McNuggets\". I live in a top-floor flat and although the encrustations on my window sill suggest either the presence of birds or a very nervous catburglar, I have never seen either. We had a garden when I was young, but it wasn't much of a haven for south-east London wildlife. My mother's approach to gardening was to cast her eye periodically round the place and lunge for anything green and flourishing and cut it back to the roots - much the same technique as she used for childrearing. The birds knew where they were not wanted and stayed away in droves. </p> <p>Not that I minded. I have never been an outdoorsy person. Although I am now at an age where my friends are starting to make noises about moving out of London to secure more space for their as-yet-unborn children, I have never hankered for the pastoral idyll myself. Any children I have will just have to learn either to thrive on diesel fumes or get dextrous with a nebuliser. The countryside is something I read about in books or see on television, generally behind John Nettles and an artfully arranged corpse. I think of it as I think of heaven - theoretically a nice place to live, but I can't believe it actually exists. </p> <p>Still, there's Simon on the phone insisting that somewhere called Suffolk is a physical reality and that if I catch a couple of trains I can see it for myself. He will provide the binoculars, and waterproof me. What he can do about dispelling my resistance to all things rural remains to be seen. </p> <p>The next morning I have a hearty breakfast, ring my family and friends to bid them remember me fondly, amend my will and set off for this mythical land. As the train pulls out of Liverpool Street, I reflect that it has been 18 months since I left London - and that was to spend two days in the secondhand bookshops of Cambridge - and become infused with the spirit of adventure. Fortunately, this soon passes. Next time I look up, we are speeding past what my handbook, The Urban Fool's Guide to Watford and Beyond, tells me I correctly identify as fields. I alight at Darsham. It is cold and raining but Simon is smiling. I don't know why. </p> <p>\"We'll go along the estuary path to the hide, once we've kitted you out,\" he explains cheerfully as I equip myself with all the gear he has kindly brought and try to conceal my welling despair. We set off. I can't get used to wearing wellies and keep trying to avoid puddles, as if they still have the power to hurt me. A few hundred yards along the path, Simon stops. I raise my eyes from my feet for the first time and realise we are in the middle of what I am pretty sure is marshland. I do not feel very safe. \"I love East Anglia,\" says Simon. \"The land doesn't make up its mind suddenly to become sea, like it does in Cornwall. It tries both out for a bit, sees how it goes.\" </p> <p>He looks through his binoculars. \"Redshanks!\" he announces. \"And black-headed gulls. Though they don't have black heads because that's just a summer thing. They've got their winter plumage now. Which is the sort of sneaky thing birds will do to you.\" </p> <p>He talks about them - and all the other birds we will see on the trip - with such warmth that I cannot help but become eager to see them. </p> <p>I am slightly hampered, however, by the fact that I cannot see through my binoculars. It's not just that the rain is obscuring their four lenses and my glasses. There is evidently a knack to using them which eludes me, so I settle for looking through them with just one eye. Even in monoscopic vision, the birds leap into focus and it is undeniably stirring. One of the gulls takes a mudbath and the redshanks in the background prove that there is at least one species that can wade gracefully. They also have red legs and this straightforward correlation between looks and name is disproportionately pleasing. All of a sudden, the day looks brighter. </p> <p>Then Simon says, \"We're making for that hide over there.\" I peer through the rain at the vague shape he is pointing to. It is 800 miles away. \"Let's go!\" I say brightly and hope that he assumes the water running down my face is just rain. </p> <p>Fifteen minutes later we are propping our elbows up at the hide's window and scanning the marshy pools for birds. I'm still \"Nelsoning with the bins\" (as you see, I'm getting to grips with the lingo) but I'm getting better at pointing them in roughly the right direction. More gulls, more redshanks - I'm already blas\u00e9 about species I didn't know existed two hours ago - and then a chunkier thing. \"A curlew,\" according to my endlessly patient host, who never tires of pointing out the different calls and diagnostic markings that enable him to make these, to me miraculous, identifications. Lapwings, dunlins, great tits, bearded tits, a bar-tailed godwit, jackdaws, rooks and shell ducks all turn up. </p> <p>It's very peaceful and a novel way to spend my time, but I'm not sure I really see the attraction. I ask if there are many female birdwatchers. \"There aren't many female twitchers - people who scour the country looking for rare birds to tick off their list - no,\" says Simon. \"That type of birdwatching appears to have more to do with the atavistic drive to collect things that men seem to have more than women. </p> <p>\"I don't want to tick 'em off. Watch that lapwing because it's beautiful and takes you out of yourself. It's mingled with regret of course, since its numbers are falling because we're in the middle of an ecological holocaust ... \" He shifts and smiles. \"But if life isn't about beauty mingled with regret, eh?\" </p> <p>We sit and watch for a bit longer and I muse silently on how strange it is to be sitting next to someone so passionate and uncynical about his subject, and how sad it is that it should be strange. I start becoming conscious of the hardness of the bench and the wetness of my trousers, and just as I'm about to put down the bins and suggest going somewhere to dry off, I catch sight of a bird. \"What's that?\" I ask. \"Where?\" says Simon, and for the first time I can point something out to him. \"Behind the black-headed gull that's still got some of its black head. It can't be a redshank, it's too big.\" </p> <p>\"Good spot,\" beams Simon. \"Good picking out. It's an oystercatcher.\" </p> <p>Well, get me. The birds change from a frustratingly indistinguishable mass to a mysterious world that had just yielded up one of its secrets. Now I begin to see what animates Simon and why he wants to show the charm of this kind of discovery to others. </p> <p>On the way back, we see a greater black-backed gull. It even has the decency to be sitting next to a lesser black-backed gull, so they look like the avian equivalent of Russian dolls. Simon tells me stories of birdwatching in America and watching hawks migrate across the Great Lakes and \"kettling\" - riding thermals and spiralling upwards in their hundreds and thousands - of the house martins that nest at his house every year and have probably been doing so for the 500 years it has been there, and of the joy birds bring. \"Not a weak-at-the-knees rush every time, of course,\" he says. \"But if you're fed up at the train station and you turn around and see a robin, your spirits lift. They have to, just a fraction.\" </p> <p>I don't see any birds at the station on the way home. But I do have the memory of the oystercatcher. And it does make me smile - or it will, when I'm home and dry. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> How to be a Bad Birdwatcher by Simon Barnes, is published by Short Books, priced \u00a39.99.</p>",
  "<p>It was a strange weekend of radio listening because, for once, it wasn't reassuring to have the set murmuring in the background - the dread of what the news bulletins might lead on was a constant presence. In this atmosphere, diversion was especially welcome, and hours don't come much more diverting than Radio 4's Saturday afternoon play, <strong>A Series of Murders</strong>. </p> <p>It was adapted from the stories of Simon Brett, that stalwart of the Radio 4 schedules, and dramatised by Jeremy Front from Brett's novels about Charles Paris, a boozy actor turned detective. And - here's the best bit - it starred Bill Nighy. </p> <p>Paris had landed a part in a trashy TV detective series, but not long into filming another cast member was killed. As the police didn't seem terribly interested, Paris began, rather wearily, toponder what might have happened. The trouble was, he was distracted by his attempts to contact his ex-wife, the attentions of an attractive 22-year-old actress and the siren calls of his hotel mini-bar ... </p> <p>There were some lovely lines. One of Paris's fellow cast members had been in a boy band, \"Boyz R Us. With a 'z' and an 'R'\". And, to his agent who had expressed doubts about the suitability of a role, Paris said, \" What do you mean? I've played the voice of a cheese triangle, for God's sake.\" </p> <p>In the last few minutes, Brett produced a resolution that was clearly absurd but did allow him what must have been the joy of allowing an author to commit murder on the grounds of actors not having done justice to the spirit of the writer's work. It would be delightful to get to know Paris further, especially if he's played by Bill Nighy again. </p> <p>Mark Tully on <strong> Private Passions</strong> (Radio 3, Sunday) was another prospect to savour, and he did not disappoint. Air time is given generously to the musical choices of guests on his show but Tully seemed even keener than most to let the music speak for itself, limiting his utterances to a few sentences. Enthusing about the pleasure he gets from presenting his wonderful Something Understood programmes with their loose theme of spirituality, he failed to mention a programme title. Even an entirely warranted plug was modestly avoided. </p> <p>Of course, what Tully did say seemed all the more valuable for its brevity. Introducing a piece by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, he said, \"This music does away with the terrible, grim image of Islam with which we are presented every day. This is Islamic music.\" The track that followed was catchy, contemporary and joyous, and it was wonderful to hear.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown will today tell the Labour conference that the economy is \"central to people's concerns\", following reports that he is being forced to take a back seat in the party's general election planning.</p> <p>Outlining the importance of Labour's economic record this morning on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the chancellor also rebutted attempts by delegates to commit the government to increase council housing investment or renationalise the railways.</p> <p>Conference voted yesterday in favour of extra funding for council tenants who choose to remain under local authorities' control, and is expected to back a call today to renationalise Network Rail.</p> <p>However, Mr Brown insisted that these proposals would not make it into Labour's manifesto, saying: \"I'll make it absolutely clear today that we've announced our public spending plans.</p> <p>\"There is no extra pre-election giveaway for that, nor for expensive proposals for the railways or anything else. If there was any extra money it would be for schools and hospitals first.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown will address the conference later this morning on the importance of the economy in helping win a third term for Labour, following widespread rumours that the party's new election strategy coordinator, Alan Milburn, was seeking to prioritise radical policies on welfare, housing, public service reforms and childcare.</p> <p>Speaking this morning, Mr Brown said restoring trust in the economy should be the mainstay of the election planning strategy. </p> <p>He added: \"Tony Blair and I together have built trust on the economy. It is a record that I think we should be proud of. </p> <p>\"But of course the issue for the future is having built trust, having built stability, how can we build on that and seize the opportunity to have a stronger economy?\" </p> <p>Asked if the use of the word \"trust\" was in fact a coded message comparing people's trust in him with a lack of trust in Mr Blair, he insisted: \"This is a government policy on the economy. This is all of us together, a cabinet.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The Labour party modernised its policies on the economy - Tony Blair and I together.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown dismissed as the \"soap opera of conference\" speculation about his supposed prime ministerial ambitions, as a Times poll published today reveals that Mr Blair is still the nation's preferred prime minister over Tory contender Michael Howard.</p> <p>\"The people who are listening to this programme are interested in their jobs - they're not interested in my job\", said Mr Brown.</p> <p>\"My job is chancellor ... That's the job I was asked to do. That is the job I continue to do. I am happy being chancellor of the exchequer.</p> <p>\"It isn't the job you do or the title or status. It's about making a difference and I am going to continue to make a difference as chancellor.\"</p> <p>The Times survey showed a mixed picture of Mr Blair's popularity.

From just outside his office there was a loud boom as yet another mortar thudded into the flowerbeds. \"I'm optimistic,\" he said. <p>Mr Adil has to be: he is Iraq's chief election officer, the man responsible for organising and overseeing general elections in Iraq, which are supposed to take place on January 31 2005. </p> <p>In theory, Iraqis across the entire country will take part in the polls to elect a new 275-member national assembly, as well as a series of local councils, using a proportional representation system. </p> <p>\"We have a plan that contains a timetable. There are certain dates we have to meet,\" Mr Adil said earlier this month, in his first ever interview since taking up the post in June. \"But if things happen outside our control, well...\" he added, breaking off. </p> <p>Many observers believe holding elections across all of Iraq in just over four months time is a virtually impossible task. Sunni towns such as Falluja, Ramadi and Samarra have become virtual no-go areas for US forces; and already one leading Sunni group, the Sunni clerics association, has dismissed the polls as \"fake\". </p> <p>During a visit to Britain, Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, insisted that January elections could go ahead even if some Iraqis don't vote; in Washington, however, senior officials in the Bush administration are beginning to express doubts. </p> <p>Even the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, admitted over the weekend that Iraq's insurgency was getting worse.</p> <p>In the interview, Mr Adil said he wanted all Iraqis to be able to vote, including Iraqi expatriates, and regardless of any reason why they might have lost citizenship under the previous regime. </p> <p>This month the process of voter registration has begun, based on an audited version of Iraq's ration-card system - a comprehensive database used to distribute food during the years when Iraq was under sanctions. </p> <p>\"We have a problem with Iraqis living abroad. And we need to update our food ration lists. Some people have died. Some people have left. Some people never got food cards in the first place,\" Mr Adil explained. </p> <p>Official estimates suggest there are 27.5 million Iraqis inside the country and another 3 million living abroad. </p> <p>And what about Saddam Hussein? Could he vote from prison or possibly even stage a comeback in January as a candidate, assuming he hasn't been convicted and executed already? \"We haven't clarified the law on this yet,\" Mr Adil admitted. </p> <p>Up until May, Mr Adil, a 47-year-old lawyer and political science graduate, worked for the Human Rights Organisation of Iraq, the country's leading human rights body. </p> <p>Since last year's US-led invasion, he has represented Iraqis who had suffered at the hands of American and British troops, including detainees tortured inside Abu Ghraib prison. </p> <p>Earlier this summer he spotted an advert placed by the United Nations inviting applications for a new seven-member independent electoral commission. Together with 1,800 other Iraqis, he sent off his CV. Numerous interviews followed; Iraq's now defunct governing council appointed him chief election officer. </p> <p>In July he and seven other commissioners - five men and two women - were whisked off to Mexico to learn about electoral procedure. (\"There was enormous security. I went out to dinner to a Mexican restaurant in an armoured car. An ambulance came behind us. When I sat down at a table, the security team made all the other diners leave,\" he recalled.) </p> <p>Mr Adil returned to Iraq, working first in al-Rashid hotel and now in chaotic temporary offices inside the convention centre, the US-protected building in Baghdad's green zone. </p> <p>Like most Iraqi officials seen as collaborating with the US/UK occupation, he now faces the constant threat of assassination. (\"I avoid taking the same route to work. I wear fancy dress,\" he said.) </p> <p>Despite the chronic lack of security in Iraq, though, some believe the chances of Mr Adil holding a successful election have recently improved. Last month the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr agreed to call off his militia's three-week uprising in Najaf and announced his intention to enter the political process. </p> <p>Both al-Sadr and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most powerful Shia cleric, a long-standing supporter of direct elections and critic of the Bush administration's failure to deliver them, have called on their followers to create a \"conducive\" environment 'to facilitate next year's polls. </p> <p>They appear to see the elections as the best opportunity to end the occupation - and achieve Iraq's first-ever Shia-dominated government. </p> <p>The elections will be held on a party-list system; one third of all candidates will be women, Mr Adil explained. The biggest problem he faces is to get Iraq's Sunni Arab minority - in towns like Falluja and Ramadi - to take part. </p> <p>Without their participation, the resistance is likely to regard Iraq's first directly elected post-Saddam government as illegitimate. </p> <p>Asked whether Mr Sadr could become prime minister, Mr Adil yesterday said: \"Maybe.\" No new census, meanwhile, will be carried out ahead of the polls because of the difficult and contested ethnic situation in towns such as Kirkuk, which is bitterly divided between Kurds and Turkomens. </p> <p>It will be up to Iraq's newly elected government to convene a national convention to draft a constitution, which will resolve this and other issues, such as the status of Kirkuk and the Kurdish autonomous region in the north, the role of women and the position of Islamic belief in secular law. </p> <p>According to the UN's timetable, voters will be asked to approve the new constitution in a referendum in October 2005. In December 2005 there will be fresh elections for Iraq's first constitutionally elected government. And after that all foreign troops should, theoretically, go home, when the UN mandate for the US-led multinational military force in Iraq expires. </p> <p>Nobody, though, appears to be banking on this. Given the very real risks, why did he take the job? \"I don't regret it. I refused to work with the old regime. For more than 30 years I watched as my colleagues reached high positions while I forbade myself,\" Mr Adil said. He added: \"I want to serve my country. Now is my chance.\"</p>",
  "Monday's highlight - eagerly pored over for every nuance by the several hundred journalists in Brighton - will be Gordon Brown's speech. <p>Last year, the chancellor emphasised \"real Labour values\", and such is the scrutiny of Mr Brown's perceived leadership intentions that every phrase will be analysed, less for what its says about \"Building Prosperity for All\" (the nominal title of the debate) than for how it plays into the Blair/Brown psychodrama.</p> <p>He will be joined on stage for the debate by the trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, who will also address delegates and spell out in greater detail Labour's plans for greater parental leave and benefits under a third term. Both speak in the morning.</p> <p>Scotland's first minister, Jack McConnell, will also be in town, briefing conference on the first year of Labour's second term north of the border - where the party rules Holyrood in coalition with the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>The afternoon plenary will see Alistair Darling talk transport - albeit within the limited context of the \"Creating Sustainable Communities\" debate, where he will be joined by the new work and pensions minister, Alan Johnson.</p> <p>Picks of the fringe will of course be the Guardian's party, invitation only, which always see an appearance from both the prime minister and the chancellor - although not at the same time last year.</p> <p>Earlier, though, the lunchtime slot sees Britain's former representative to Iraq, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, speak on \"Stability and Democracy in Iraq\" at the Foreign Policy Centre fringe, while across town the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland interviews Ed Balls at 1pm.

  "<p>Estelle has an abscess. Clutching a cheek swollen to the size of a tennis ball, it's clear she's finding talking difficult. She apologises in advance for mumbling and frets that she may dribble. Perhaps this isn't the best time to ask her about black footballer-turned-TV-personality Garth Crooks' recent comments that there is a direct link between rap music and films that glorify violence and the drift of black boys into crime. And yet, after a pause lasting a millisecond, Estelle explodes. </p> <p>\"How the hell can he say that?\" she blasts. \"Film was around before rap music. Bonnie and Clyde were around long before rap music.\" The abscess is growing larger. She's clearly in pain, but there's no stopping the girl whose jangling earrings form a musical accompaniment to her fury. \"So rap music is the role model for violence? Look at what Bush and Blair are doing. It's too easy to point the finger at kids in the inner city and say it's all their fault. Go live a week in Brixton and see how much violence actually happens. Very little! These people sit at their dinner tables with their trust funds and have these views of the world. I am from the urban youth. I make rap music! Listen to my lyrics and tell me I have a link with violence. Argh! I am so mad.\" Another tiny pause. \"Anyway, pleased to meet you, I'm Estelle.\" </p> <p>At 24, Estelle Swaray (surname dropped for professional purposes) is the loudest new voice in hip-hop. She already has a hit (July's autobiographical 1980) and a Mobo nomination for best newcomer behind her. She also has much to say in a genre that, with some sympathy for Crooks, has often been reduced to parody by lyrics about guns and cars. Although Estelle's fusion of hip-hop and soul suggest she is the UK's answer to Mary J Blige, her socially observant wordplay makes her closer to afemale version of the Streets. </p> <p>On her new single Free she pleads: \"Put down your weed, do something with your life.\" Who is she address ing? \"The 2% who believe that life will come to them,\" she says. \"I'm tired of people coming up to me saying, 'I wish I could do what you do but I love my weed too much.' What a terrible attitude. I'm addressing people who sit around and they could be black kids or white kids or people who have trust funds, but it's nothing to do with rap music.\" </p> <p>She may occasionally come across as a fusion of Miss Jean Brodie and Norman Tebbit, but in the cliched world of rap, Estelle is something different. She refuses to follow predecessors such as Salt'n'Pepa and Lil' Kim in accepting the industry diktat that sex sells. \"The only way I'm going on the cover of FHM is in a body bag,\" she blasts. </p> <p>Her background is already a talking point, thanks to a lyric in 1980 about growing up in a flat three floors up from a man who lay dead for three weeks and was eaten by his cats. \"Oh, I had it easy,\" she shrugs. \"I didn't have to find him. My mum went in to clean the house because the council hadn't done it. A woman with six kids should have no obligation to do that.\" </p> <p>Her mother and father came from Senegal and Grenada respectively. Estelle grew up in south-west London in a four bedroom house with: \"My family, my grandma, aunties, uncles and brothers, in and out of prison daily.\" Seeing her uncle \"regularly carted off to jail\" was enough to keep her on the straight and narrow - although she laughs at the irony that he also turned her on to hip-hop. </p> <p>Her mother took no chances by keeping Estelle in the house at night until she was 15 and making sure she attended church. She admits she was probably seen as prudish; then again, the estate's so-called \"bad boys\" were forever popping round for Mrs Swaray's hospitality, suggesting that what embryonic young gangstas really need are hugs and tea and biscuits. Her father built reggae speakers in the living room. \"I sure learned how to be heard,\" she says. A bright child, she sometimes escaped into a private world of books and remembers reading a \"three-parter\" about sex and race when she was eight. \"It's a common perception that kids from black areas have an IQ of nothing.\" </p> <p>Her crucial formative experience - recalled in the lyric \"went to Africa and came back darker\" - came with two childhood visits to the former slavery port of Goree in Senegal. She was horrified by holes in the ground, in which \"three or four strapping black men\" would have been put prior to export. \"That made me realise the world was unfair.\" </p> <p>It took a while before she started putting these thoughts into music. Initially, she wanted to be a lawyer, but she started rapping aged 13 and at 18 began to write her own rhymes. Music had always been in the house - Bob Marley, Yazz, Mel and Kim. She has a refreshing disregard for \"cool\" and even confesses to a love of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. </p> <p>Wasn't the industry itself difficult to break into? \"Not for me because I didn't see it like that,\" Estelle says. \"I thought, 'How am I gonna do this?'\" What she did was make a pest of herself, badgering rappers like Talib Kweli and Rodney P for opening slots. When record company offers came, she was unimpressed: \"I'd read books about the industry, so I knew they were insulting.\" </p> <p>An offer to join a girl band triggered her war on stereotypes. \"They wanted an older one, a trendy, cosmopolitan one and a sexy one,\" she says. \"I tried but I couldn't fake it.\" After releasing her tunes through her own label, she picked up several hip-hop awards. When other record companies came calling, she knew they were thinking: \"What the hell do we do with her?\" \"I'm short, I'm dark-skinned, I've got short hair and I don't have sex with people in the industry,\" she points out. But she has her words, which draw power from the fact that they are \"100% real\". </p> <p>Estelle has attempted to write fiction but stopped after four lines because it was \"whack\". She says she'd rather concentrate on real life than the usual hip-hop fantasies. \"I am not a gangsta,\" she shrieks. \"It's fake and it's too much lying to keep up with, all that stuff about a big car and a Glock under the seat. Everyone I know who has come into contact with guns doesn't want to be involved in that stuff.\" In any case, she feels there's enough drama in her own world. In the stunning Hey Girl, she delivers exquisite rebuffs to a long-term boyfriend whom she now hates for \"messing around\". </p> <p>Occasionally, glimpses of vulnera bility suggest the tough front was adopted the hard way. Has she been bullied? \"All day,\" she says, untypically quietly. \"But I've learned to shut my mouth and choose my battles. I've never hit anybody - I've learned that you can destroy people with words and that's more powerful.\" </p> <p>Her words will take her a long way. Estelle's ambitions are to make an album as memorable as Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation, to run her own successful record label and make a \"billion\" pounds, which she will use to help her \"family's kids and successive generations\" and bring an end to global suffering. It's a grand strategy. \"I'm Capricorn, we plan,\" she smiles - and, so far at least, there's only one thing stopping her. </p> <p>\"I know,\" she winces. \"I really need a dentist.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Free is released on October 4 on Jdid/V2.</p>",

  "<p>The minimum wage, which this week rises almost 8% to \u00a34.85 an hour, is having an ever greater impact on firms but has not led to any job losses, according to a study which has sparked a row between business and the unions. </p> <p>Pay specialist Incomes Data Services says while the minimum wage has risen at an average of 7% a year since its launch in 1999 if anything there has been an increase in employment in traditional low-wage sectors such as retailing and hospitality. </p> <p>While the economy has been growing steadily for years, pushing total employment to record highs, average pay across the economy has risen 3% a year, less than half the rises in the minimum wage. </p> <p>Alistair Hatchett, head of pay services at IDS, said it was possible the minimum wage could rise further without any negative impact on jobs. \"Many firms have already moved their lowest rates to \u00a35 an hour, so there is clearly room for the minimum wage to rise to at least this level in 2005.\" </p> <p>Many low-pay firms had made significant changes to their behaviour as a result of the minimum wage, such as moving their earnings reviews to October and adjusting pay differentials, he said. </p> <p>\"The increases in the minimum wage - outstripping the rise in average earnings - have forced employers to rethink their grade structures and to introduce new ways of working. Some have moved towards team working, with most staff on a single spot rate.\" </p> <p>The TUC seized on the survey's findings as proof the minimum wage was working and accused employers' group the CBI of \"crying wolf\" by warnings that increasing its level would cost jobs. </p> <p>\"The minimum wage is doing the business. It helps about a million people every time it goes up, most of them part-time women workers, and jobs have been gained, not lost,\" said TUC chief Brendan Barber. </p> <p>\"But the CBI seems to be stuck in a minimum wage Groundhog Day. Every time it increases, they cry wolf on job losses. It's time they accepted that the wage works and instead concentrated on helping the government and trade unions crack down on employers who are still not paying staff the legal minimum.\" </p> <p>The CBI's director of human resources policy, Susan Anderson, said: \"Nobody should be complacent about increases in the minimum wage. We cannot afford to go on forever giving people increases well above rises in average earnings. </p> <p>\"The wage is now on the radar for big businesses as well as small. Business will not oppose rises that can be justified. But the TUC and IDS are clearly jumping the gun by suggesting they know a figure above \u00a35 will be OK.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week the minimum wage goes up from \u00a34.50 to \u00a34.85 an hour. That is not much money, especially considering the excessive wages that top managers scoop for themselves - while simultaneously try to keep a lid on wage increases at the bottom. But it is a lot more than it would have been if the Conservatives had been in power, and the establishment of a minimum wage remains one of Labour's lasting achievements. For the each of the past two years the minimum wage has risen by around 7.5%, twice the rate of average earnings, without the adverse consequences - igniting inflation or aggravating unemployment - that its critics, especially employers, predicted. </p> <p>The next few years will be more difficult. The government is not committed to maintaining growth at twice average earnings and there are signs of more employer - and maybe prime ministerial - resistance on the grounds that the big increases of the past were only one-off \"catch-ups\" to remedy past injustices. It would do Tony Blair's credibility no harm if he pledged the government to continue sharp rises in the minimum wage. </p> <p>There are several good reasons. The first is moral: labourers are worthy of their hire. A decent minimum wage is the hallmark of a civilised country. Second, high percentage increases for those on low wages are not as dramatic they look because the cash element is so low. There is scant evidence that a higher minimum wage has caused wage inflation or unemployment. Coming when the economy is said to be approaching its productive potential, a robust hike in the minimum wage would be easily absorbed. Indeed, there are indirect signs that it might be attracting people back into the labour force from the millions of \"economically inactive\" who are without work but who do not appear on either the \"claimant\" count of the unemployed or the International Labour Organisation measure. </p> <p>In these circumstances the government should give an unequivocal pledge that the minimum wage will continue to rise at least at the pace of recent years until there is evidence that the adverse consequences outweigh the benefits. That time is not yet in sight and while it would be admirable to keep the tripartite consensus (government, unions and employers) that has characterised the setting of the minimum benchmark so far, this issue is too important to give the employers a veto. If they showed any signs of being able to control pay increases at the highest level in their own organisations, then they might have more credibility in dealing with the bottom end. But they haven't, so they shouldn't.</p>",
  "<p>As birds fly south and beaches empty, the aid community is gathering for a new school year at the joint annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. </p> <p>There are some big exams in the coming year, with the UK leading the way: in chronological order, the report of the Africa Commission, the G8 summit in Scotland, our EU presidency, and the UN summit in September next year on progress towards the millennium development goals. Aid will feature prominently in all of these. There is more money available, but there are also five tests hidden in the timetable. Will governments pass? </p> <p>First, governments need to decide on a new president for the World Bank, to replace James Wolfensohn whose term expires in 2005. Historically, the job remains in the patronage of the US president, to balance a European appointment to the IMF. This is obviously wrong, and there have been calls for a transparent selection process, based on merit and open to all nationalities. The European donors are unlikely to stand up for a better process, having just secured the IMF post for their own candidate, the former Spanish economy minister Rodrigo Rato. But they should - and should insist on a candidate, whoever wins the US election, committed to the pro-poor and internationalist position that Wolfensohn has largely followed. Developing countries should also be staking positions here. Should Wolfensohn be asked to stay on while a new appointment process is put in place? </p> <p>Second, the replenishment of the International Development Association needs to be decided by December and ratified by June next year. The IDA is the soft-loan window of the World Bank, committing some $8bn (\u00a34.5bn) a year towards poverty reduction programmes in about 70 countries that have little or no access to financial markets. In many, the IDA is the largest source of external funds. In most, it has huge influence. </p> <p>The US has been pushing the IDA to provide most if not all of its assistance as grants, not loans. This is consistent with the campaign for greater debt relief to poor countries, for most of whom the IDA is now the largest remaining creditor. A more selective proposal would be to give grants only to those countries that have no reasonable prospects of repaying - around a quarter of the total. Either way, governments should support a strong IDA for the poorest countries. If they decide to be magnanimous, by increasing the share of grants, they should provide additional funding so the burden does not fall on future borrowers. </p> <p>Third, however, the governance of the IDA, and for that matter the Bank as whole and the IMF, needs review. At present, the big donors dominate IDA policymaking and poor countries play only a supporting role. This needs to change. A progressive UK government would be pressing for greater direct accountability to poor countries, even though this will dilute its own influence. It would offer significantly increased funding in return for improved governance. It could start by measures to increase the lamentably low influence of Africa, as that is the main theme of the G8 next year. </p> <p>Fourth, we are going to hear a great deal in coming months about Gordon Brown's brain-child, the international financial facility. This is a device to speed up aid flows by raising money on bond markets, using promises of future aid as collateral. If the IFF does achieve enough momentum for lift-off in the next year, the critical question will be how to manage the money. Will this simply be a way of channelling more cash to an unreformed set of multilateral agencies? Or, equally unsatisfactory, will it be earmarked by individual donors as an extension of their bilateral aid? The best option would be for governments and agencies to bid for money on the basis of poverty impact, introducing genuine competition into the aid system. The chancellor is committed to results-based management: this is his chance to transform the essentially patronage-based allocation systems. </p> <p>Finally, competition in the aid system would help resolve the incoherent and inefficient structure of the aid industry. There are more than 90 international public aid agencies, ranging from very large to very small, with a high degree of overlap. Imagine being, say, Mozambique and facing 15 official delegations just on education development, or more visiting aid missions overall than there are days in the year. </p> <p>This market structure resembles nothing as much as one Wal-Mart and a whole string of corner shops. It would be both unstable and monopolistic in a genuine market, socially inefficient and politically unacceptable. But this is not a market, and it is not well regulated. No major aid agency has closed for decades while many have opened. The irony is that, unlike shops, the same owners - rich country governments - control all the outlets. They could decide for things to be otherwise, if they had the will. </p> <p>After years of decline, aid is at last increasing. More aid will help towards the millennium development goals, but it is not enough. The next big challenge, and the biggest task facing governments next year, is to take on reform, creating an aid system that is streamlined, effective and accountable. UN reform is at the heart of this, which is why next September's summit is important. </p> <p>Will governments around the world pass their exams? The beginning of the school year is an optimistic moment. Let's hope they do. </p> <p><em> Andrew Rogerson is a research fellow of the Overseas Development Institute; Simon Maxwell is its director </em></p>",
  "<p>Daily Mail proprietor Lord Rothermere today said he cannot guarantee the paper will support Michael Howard in the next election.</p> <p>Lord Rothermere said he was disappointed with the Conservative leader's progress to reform the party so far and that the Daily Mail, which is seen as the paper of conservative middle-England, would back whichever party best supported the middle classes.</p> <p>\"The Conservatives do not have a God-given right to expect the loyalty of the Daily Mail. The Daily Mail supports the middle class of this country and if the middle class of this country are better supported by another political party and feels that way then I am sure that Paul [Dacre, the Mail editor] would make the corresponding decision,\" he told the Independent.</p> <p>Lord Rothermere described Mr Howard as \"a considerable politician\" but added: \"I don't think he is doing as good a job as many people hoped he would at this stage, but I think there is a long time to run and he may come through.\"</p> <p>The Daily Mail has traditionally backed the Tories, although the young Lord Rothermere's father abandoned the Conservative benches in the House of Lords before the 1997 election that swept Labour to power - a move that was interpreted at the time as a signal of the Daily Mail's disenchantment with John Major.</p> <p>At the 2001 election the paper did not support the Tories, but its relationship with New Labour had soured to such an extent it warned readers not to help create \"an elective dictatorship\".</p> <p>The Mail told readers they should not \"be seduced by the herd instinct of most of the media, but to vote in a way that will prevent Labour having overweening power\", adding: \"That is why the Mail urges voters to think long and hard about the consequences of a Labour landslide.\"</p> <p>In today's interview Lord Rothermere reveals he does not enjoy the same kind of relationship with Mr Dacre as his father did with his predecessor, Sir David English, who was a dominating force at the Mail for decades before.</p> <p>\"It was a unique relationship,\" he said of his father and Sir David, who died a few weeks before the paper's proprietor. \"They were like twins, basically very close brothers talking twice or three times a day and seeing each other socially. They died close to each other, and I don't think that was necessarily by coincidence. I don't have a relationship like that with anybody, unfortunately. I wish I did, but I don't,\" he says.</p> <p>Mr Dacre's control of the editorial output of the Daily Mail is also confirmed by Lord Rothermere, who appears to lack the confidence of his father. </p> <p>\"Paul comes to see me whenever he needs to talk to me. There is no set time. I certainly don't talk to Paul as much as my father talked to David English. I think Paul would find that intrusive.\"</p> <p>He says his own views \"are not necessarily the views of the newspaper\" but fails to elaborate, although there is a suspicion that his views are more liberal than those of the paper. </p> <p>He pays tribute to his arch-rival, Express boss Richard Desmond, and says he admires his passion for business.</p> <p>\"I think Richard Desmond is a very clever man.

  "When journalist William Weston was invited to visit the secessionary US west coast states of Washington, Oregon and northern California in 1999, he came upon a society unlike any other. <p>In Ecotopia, all products from houses to shoes were made from sustainable, recyclable materials. Bikes could be found unlocked at every street corner, free to be used and left again by passers-by. Cars had been banned from San Francisco, and pollution was a crime. Locals enjoyed free love, honoured trees and lived in small, sustainable communities. In short, the hippies had taken over.</p> <p>Depending on your point of view, Ernest Callenbach's utopian 1975 novel Ecotopia: The notebooks and reports of William Weston is either an idealistic road-map to a sustainable society or a slightly sinister piece of lotus-eating fantasy.</p> <p>Whatever your opinion, its dream of an environmentalist political takeover has stubbornly failed to materialise in reality. Over the course of the 1990s, Green parties and factions made it into governing coalitions in 14 European countries, but the whiff of power is more often than not the kiss of death for their ambitions. Only in Germany have they survived without either electoral demolition or oligarchic corruption. In New Zealand, the Greens \"tolerate\" the Labour-led coalition government, but are well down in the polls since their high point at the 2002 election.</p> <p>Such concerns must be keeping Australian Greens up at night, given that they are expected to transform themselves from a fringe party to a significant power-broker at the federal election on October 9. How does a party founded on principles of pure idealism cope when thrown deep into the messy pit of politics?</p> <p>Observant readers may at this point be wondering if claims of a Green takeover are a little overheated. According to a Roy Morgan poll published today, the Greens are only expected to take nine per cent of the vote. This will take their representation to between four and seven seats, out of a total 76 in the senate.</p> <p>Not much, you might say. But minority parties in the senate hold a unique position in Australian politics. The Democrats party, an organisation absent in the house of representatives, currently holds seven seats in the senate, four of them up for grabs when half of senate seats go up for re-election in a fortnight.</p> <p>Numerically they don't amount to much, but strategically they are crucial because the government rarely gets a majority in the senate. So if the opposition refuses to support a bill or amends it to shreds, the Democrats - and the clutch of four independents in the senate - are in an influential position to negotiate their own amendments, in exchange for offering their votes to help the bill over the line.</p> <p>Since the 2001 election, they have exercised this power to block 10 government bills and allowed 400 others through. In the fields of unfair dismissal law, media ownership, and further privatisation of state telecommunication company Telstra, they have all used their influence to moderate government.</p> <p>Voters seem to like having a minority party in the senate because it prevents the house becoming either a partisan battlefield or a cosy duopoly between government and opposition. The Democrats' role, as founder Don Chipp proclaimed after breaking away from a 1977 coalition government, has always been \"to keep the bastards honest\". Their main campaign theme for this election has the leadership standing tough like the cast of a cop show above the tagline \"the lie detectors\".</p> <p>But Australia now seems to have decided to trade in its lie detectors for new models. The Democrats are facing annihilation at the next election, with a Morgan poll today showing their support at just 1%, down from 5.41% at the last election and 8.45% in 1998 when their current crop of candidates were elected. </p> <p>Waiting in the wings are the Greens, and their greatest asset is their leader, Bob Brown. At 59, he's the closest thing international environmental politics has to an elder statesman.</p> <p>He was working as a GP in the northern Tasmanian town of Launceston in 1972 when he joined the United Tasmania group, a party regarded as the forerunner of Green parties around the world.</p> <p>A campaign against dam-building on Tasmania's Franklin river in early 1980s propelled him to national prominence and the state parliament, and since 1996 he has been a senator for Tasmania.</p> <p>Voters across the political spectrum like him for the same reason that many of his parliamentary colleagues loathe him: his image of heart-on-sleeve integrity and his insistence on speaking out regardless of protocol.</p> <p>This image got its most significant airing last October during George Bush's high-security flying visit to Canberra. Still obsessed with their feelings of isolation from the wider world, Australian politicians normally treat such foreign dignitaries the way teachers treat school inspectors. Everyone in parliament is expected to be on their best behaviour. In the capital of a country famed for its devil-may-care attitude, \"protocol\" suddenly becomes the buzzword.</p> <p>So the heckling by Brown and fellow Greens senator Kerry Nettle during Bush's speech to parliament went down like a fart at a funeral. The pair were jostled by fellow politicians and received a 24-hour ban from parliament.</p> <p>But when Brown left Canberra and headed back to Tasmania for the weekend, the reception could not have been more different. He was treated to applause in an airport lounge, a standing ovation in a Hobart cafe, and a chorus of approval in the streets.</p> <p>It would be a mistake to think this was simply the result of him running into a lot of leftwingers. Brown's forthright behaviour had tapped into traditional Aussie values of integrity, irreverence and humour that cut across all political divides. </p> <p>It is this feeling of honesty about the Greens which is now propelling them ahead of the Democrats. The lie detectors lost the faith of voters when they used their bloc vote to pass the GST, a hugely unpopular VAT-style sales tax that Australia introduced in 2000. That action sparked a round of feuding, splits and leadership challenges which has seen Democrat support plummet to its current level, where they will be lucky to hold onto one seat come the election.</p> <p>The risk for the Greens is that holding the balance of power in the Senate could land them with many of the same problems that have hampered the Democrats.</p> <p>Assuming the narrow coalition victory that polls are predicting, the government could find itself thwarted at every turn by an implacably opposed group of Labor and Green senators. In such circumstances, Australian governments dissolve both houses of parliament and call another election, complaining about the minority senators who are stopping them running the country. The electorate usually punishes the opposition parties at the ballot.</p> <p>Such a situation could mean the Greens fading from influence almost as soon as they gain it, but the most obvious alternative would be equally unpalatable: for them to give their senate votes to a coalition government which stands for everything they are opposed to.</p> <p>There are other alternatives. A Labor victory would see the Greens becoming crucial partners in government, and a hung parliament could even result in them entering a coalition with Labor. A strong coalition performance in the senate would see them sidelined by a government majority that would turn the second house into a rubber stamp, much like Westminster's House of Lords.</p> <p>Whatever happens, in the long term the struggle for the election will be the least of the Greens' worries.</p>",
  "<p>A former director of the Press Complaints Commission has warned that the British media are \"perilously close\" to having a fully-fledged privacy law forced upon them after a deadline to reverse the landmark Princess Caroline privacy ruling passed. </p> <p>The ruling, which stated that Princess Caroline of Monaco's privacy was violated by the publication of photographs of her and her family even though they were taken in a public place, must be taken into account by the British courts after the German government failed to lodge an appeal by last Friday's deadline.</p> <p>Mark Bolland, a former director of the PCC and the Prince of Wales's former communications adviser, believes the effect of the decision along with the Naomi Campbell verdict earlier this year will be \"disastrous\".</p> <p>\"For a few years, the problem [of a privacy law] seemed to be dormant at best. But a lot has changed in the last year - and a range of decisions here and in Strasbourg have, in effect, created a judge-made privacy law,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Most disastrous was the Naomi Campbell judgment in the Lords which - combined with the Princess Caroline ruling - has produced a law in this country which gives huge succour to celebrities and crooks, but absolutely nothing to ordinary people.\"</p> <p>The House of Lords ruled earlier this year that the Daily Mirror had been wrong to publish a photograph of the model Campbell outside a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the publication of photographs of the Princess and her family in German magazines constituted a violation of article eight of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to respect for private life.</p> <p>The European convention on human rights has been incorporated into UK law, and judges are obliged to take account of the judgments of the Strasbourg court.</p> <p>Mr Bolland said the interested parties were once again in the \"last chance saloon\" - a reference Sir David Calcutt's 1990 report on media intrusions of privacy, which was summed up in Whitehall as a warning that editors had to take action. </p> <p>\"Unless those who want to stop the judges deciding what is in newspapers resolve to make a stand, in five years there will be a fully-fledged privacy law in this country which will have hugely detrimental consequences for press, TV and online publications.</p> <p>\"It isn't too late. But it is getting perilously close to being so,\" he warned.</p> <p>Mr Bolland's warning chimes with the views of many media lawyers, who believe the Princess Caroline ruling has major implications for the British media - and the paparazzi in particular.</p> <p>Mark Thomson, a partner with the law firm Carter-Ruck, believes \"media law is heading for a serious shake-up\" in the wake of the ruling.</p> <p>\"Princess Caroline's case is a strong and clear warning from Strasbourg to the English courts that they have a positive obligation to protect the privacy rights of individuals,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Strasbourg has spoken and it now remains to be seen how the English courts will react.\"</p> <p>But Tim Toulmin, the director of the PCC, played down the prospect of a full privacy law as a result of the two landmark decisions.</p> <p>\"The answer is that no one yet knows. We won't find out what the true impact is until it is tested in a British court,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Mark [Bolland] and other influential commentators have differing views on the subject - I don't want to nail my colours to the mast.\"</p> <p>Mr Toulmin said the PCC's code was flexible enough to accommodate the courts' rulings in both cases.</p> <p>\"In the Princess Caroline case I am confident that the PCC could have found a solution because she was effectively being stalked and the PCC has very strong rules on harassment,\" he added.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Anti-terrorist police have been given permission to hold four men arrested over an alleged plot to buy material for a \"dirty bomb\" until Friday. </p> <p>Three were held in a preplanned operation by the Metropolitan police at a hotel in Brent Cross in north London on Friday, acting on information provided by the News of the World. </p> <p>Yesterday the paper claimed an undercover reporter posing as a Muslim extremist had exposed the alleged plot after a tip-off that a Saudi sympathetic to \"the Muslim cause\" would pay \u00a3300,000 for a kilogram of radioactive red mercury. </p> <p>The substance is said to have been developed in Russia to be used in \"briefcase nuclear bombs\", although scientists are divided over whether it actually exists. </p> <p>In a sting of the kind for which the News of the World has become infamous, Mazher Mahmood, its investigations editor, allegedly convinced the men he could get hold of red mercury. </p> <p>He met them several times, supposedly with the aim of arranging to provide them with the material to supply to a Middle Eastern buyer - described by the newspaper as a \"Mr Big in Saudi Arabia\". </p> <p>The journalist was allegedly told the substance would be used either \"here in the UK or the USA\". </p> <p>The paper called in Scotland Yard, and on Friday a final meeting was arranged at the Holiday Inn in Brent Cross. </p> <p>Police marksmen and surveillance teams surrounded the hotel and the alleged gang members were taken in custody. A fourth man was held at his north London home, police said. </p> <p>All four were arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act, on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and taken to Paddington Green police station for questioning. </p> <p>\"In relation to the News of the World story regarding the purchase of radioactive material, this is forming part of the investigation, which is currently at an early stage,\" a Met spokesman said. \"Several addresses have been searched. Some searches continue.\" </p> <p>Senior anti-terrorist sources suggested there was no plot to target any particular location, and the potential danger was not on the scale of those surrounding arrests and charges under anti-terror legislation during the summer. </p> <p>Though there is widespread scepticism in security circles about the uses to which red mercury could be put, Whitehall officials said that police were obliged to act on the information they had been given by the News of the World. </p> <p>Mahmood is renown as the \"fake sheikh\" who revealed indiscretions by the Countess of Wessex and by Newcastle United bosses, and has something of a chequered history. </p> <p>In 2002 the paper claimed to have uncovered a plot to kidnap Victoria Beckham and her two sons, Brooklyn and Romeo. </p> <p>Five innocent men spent seven months in jail as a result; but the case unravelled when it emerged that the paper had paid \u00a310,000 to Florim Gashi, a convicted conman, for information leading to the story. </p> <p>The accused men's lawyers said that transcripts of tapes showed they discussed the kidnap idea after Mr Gashi, a car park attendant from south London, suggested it.</p>",
  "<p>No-win, no-fee deals, which allow solicitors to claim up to \u00a3800 an hour if they win libel or privacy cases, are having a \"chilling effect\" on freedom of speech, 13 media organisations will tell the government today. </p> <p>The press and broadcasting groups, including Guardian Newspapers, Times Newspapers, the BBC and ITN, want changes in the rules for conditional fee agreements (CFAs) which, they say, are holding the media to ransom. </p> <p>Under such agreements lawyers are paid nothing if they lose, but can claim an \"uplift\" on their normal fees if they win. In libel cases, a 100% \"success fee\" is common, giving them double their usual fees, payable by the losing media company. </p> <p>In some cases claimants insure against the cost of losing and having to pay their opponent's costs. The premium, itself expensive, is usually payable only if the claimant wins - in which case the media company will have to pay it, along with the claimants' double costs. </p> <p>The \"massive legal fees\" of some law firms are imposing \"intolerable pressure\" on media companies to settle even unmeritorious cases, the media groups will tell the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer. </p> <p>For claims which succeed, the fees demanded by claimants' lawyers are often \"wildly disproportionate to the damages recoverable\". </p> <p>The demand for change comes in a response to a Department for Constitutional Affairs consultation paper on proposals to simplify the CFA regime. </p> <p>The media groups, who also include Associated Newspapers, Express Newspapers and the Newspaper Society, representing regional papers, say some firms charge \u00a3400 an hour, doubled to \u00a3800 with the 100% success fee. </p> <p>Solicitors specialising in libel, they point out, are \"among the most expensive in the country\". </p> <p>Their costs almost invariably dwarf the damages payable. Defamation actions are easy to bring but difficult and expensive to defend. </p> <p>The media groups are calling for a maximum uplift of 12.5% if the case settles early; power for the court to cap overall costs; and a right to challenge the size of the uplift. </p> <p>They cite an appeal court judgment last May in which Lord Justice Brooke said the \"obvious unfairness\" of the system in which a newspaper could have to pay double costs if it lost but could not get back its own costs if it won - because the claimant had no insurance - was \"bound to have a chilling effect on a newspaper exercising its right to freedom of expression\". </p> <p>The judge said Adam Musa King, who was suing the Sunday Telegraph, claiming it wrongly suggested he had terrorist links, would be unlikely to get more than \u00a3150,000 damages. </p> <p>Yet his solicitors, Peter Carter-Ruck &amp; Partners, stood to double their costs to more than \u00a3700,000. </p> <p>If the paper won, it would not get its costs back because Mr King had no insurance. </p> <p>The court said no-win, no-fee deals had been introduced to help poor people in personal injury cases. </p> <p>Parliament might not have thought of their possible exploitation in libel cases.</p>",
  "<p>'He went up there from Bethel; and while he was going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him saying, 'Go away, baldy! Go away, baldy!' When he turned around and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then two she-bears came out of the woods and mauled 42 of the boys.\" (2 Kings 2:23-24) </p> <p>Apparently, the prophet Elisha couldn't take a joke. And neither, it seems, can the 6,000 Christians who have successfully petitioned the director general of the BBC to scrap plans to show the Vatican cartoon comedy Popetown. Apparently, depicting the Pope on a pogo stick (with voice by Ruby Wax) surrounded by scheming cardinals is likely to offend believers and threaten their faith. </p> <p>Well, I'm offended too. But unlike the 6,000, I'm offended by the implication that, as a Christian, I am a humourless over-sensitive wimp whose faith requires special protection. I'm offended by always being classed alongside the offended. </p> <p>For being offended by the prospect of the Pope on a pogo stick is a transparent form of passive/aggressive manipulation - casting oneself as the hard-done-to victim while pulling all the strings. Using the mock innocent vulnerability of \"being offended\" as a weapon with which to make others do things your way is never going to win any friends. </p> <p>Moreover, it is precisely because religious people get in a huff so very easily that they are so funny. The reason you can't stop sniggering in church is because of the perceived disapproval of others. Without the disapproval, there's nothing to laugh about. Ironically, therefore, it's the 6,000 outraged Christians and all the others like them that keep the writers of Popetown, Father Ted and The Life of Brian in business. The best way to become an object of fun is to act like the boot-faced Puritan relatives that went to stay with Edmund Blackadder. </p> <p>At what point, I wonder, did Christians loose their sense of humour? Dairmaid MacCulloch begins his great work on the Reformation in the small English country church at Preston Blisset in Buckinghamshire. Looking up from behind the altar the priest cannot avoid noticing the carving of an ample early-14th-century arse directed straight towards him. Professor MacCulloch doesn't know its purpose but reminds us that \"this was a religion where shouts of laughter as well as roars of rage were common in church, where the clergy waged a constant if perhaps sometimes half-hearted battle against the invasion of fun\". </p> <p> Ridiculing the church, the clergy, bishops and the Pope has a long history. For early Protestants, the ecclesiastical establishment represented by the Pope was perceived as an instrument of domination and self-serving power. In Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, the monastery librarian finds Aristotle's lost work in praise of comedy. Realising its potential to undermine the status quo, he poisons its pages. The moral of which is that the church is afraid of laughter because laughter is impossible to control. </p> <p>It is little wonder that the earthier reformers used laughter as a weapon against the Vatican. Unlike many of today's Christians, the Luther who offered the Pope \"a fart for a staff\" cared little about giving offence. Not that causing offensive was the end purpose. For Luther, humour was a way to cast down the mighty from their thrones. Humour works to expose the pious, the pompous and the arrogant. Laughter is the sound of resistance. </p> <p>The point being made here has nothing to do with Roman Catholicism. Laughter seeks out those in power. And if power bites back against laughter, then we begin to glimpse the grim face of absolute control - which is why the divine, above all, must have a sense of humour. </p> <p>The decision to withdraw Popetown suggests a religion that cannot laugh at itself, a religion of claustrophobic disapproval, a religion where control is smuggled in under the guise of sensitivity. OK, sometimes the laughter is cruel - but there are bigger issues at stake. For the ability to laugh at oneself is perhaps the most effective litmus test which detects healthy from dangerous religion. </p> <p>Elijah mocked the prophets of Baal for the impotence of their gods. He sarcastically lays into their lifeless divinity: perhaps \"he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or he is asleep and must be awakened\". It's not side-splitting stuff, admittedly. But it suggests a scriptural licence for having a go at some contemporary idols of thought. Christians can't stop the laughter. And we shouldn't want to. For we really ought to be laughing back. </p> <p> The Rev Dr Giles Fraser is vicar of Putney and lecturer in philosophy at Wadham College, Oxford </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:giles.fraser@btinternet.com\">giles.fraser@btinternet.com</a></p>",
  "Labour big guns yesterday insisted that Britain's historic two-party system makes the coming general election a contest between Labour and the Conservatives. <p>But they turned a lot of their fire against the Liberal Democrats ahead of Thursday's Hartlepool byelection. </p> <p>Iain Wright, Labour's candidate in Peter Mandelson's old seat, is defending a 14,571 majority against the Lib Dems' Jody Dunn. </p> <p>But he is fighting it like a marginal. </p> <p>Signals from both sides - the Lib Dems say it will be close - suggest Labour is increasingly confident of victory. </p> <p>But the party took no chances on the opening day of its Brighton conference. </p> <p>Labour's chairman, Ian McCartney, its general secretary, Matt Carter, and the newly appointed campaigns coordinator, Alan Milburn, went out of their way to try to disabuse voters of what Mr Carter called the media myth that the Lib Dems are a\"harmless group of cuddly do-gooders\". </p> <p>Mr McCartney claimed that Lib Dem votes only serve to shore up Tory governments - true in the 80s, but not the case since 1997 - and that \"if you go to bed with Charles Kennedy you wake up with Michael Howard\". </p> <p>Mr Milburn told reporters that whenever the Lib Dem level of public support rises - as at Hartlepool and the wider country - \"it also raises the bar and makes the test of credibility so much higher. But in the end what British politics is about is Tory versus Labour'.' </p> <p>Mr McCartney said most Scots - like himself - were straight-talking, but \"voters should remember, Charles Kennedy is a Liberal Democrat first and a Scotsman second\". </p> <p>He challenged the Lib Dems to explain why they want to scrap Labour's New Deal for jobs, pensioner credits and higher minimum wage. </p> <p>In a passage that may cause real anger, Mr McCartney, whose son died of a drug overdose, added: \"Why is it that every time your Lib Dem MPs have had the chance to vote to protect decent people from crime and antisocial behaviour, they have sided with the drug dealers, vandals and yobs?\" </p> <p>Labour's justification for such talk is that Lib Dem policy-makers talk tough, but shy away from endorsing Labour remedies such as antisocial behaviour orders. </p> <p>Lib Dems say Labour's methods are too crude and do not work. </p> <p>Crime is an issue in Hartlepool, along with the fate of the local hospital. </p> <p>Jeremy Middleton, the Tory candidate, second last time, is fighting Respect, Ukip and the Greens for a decent share of the vote. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Tony Blair yesterday warned pro-hunters against breaking the law and praised Alun Michael's efforts to find the kind of compromise the prime minister himself had backed. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately it was voted against by the Commons and then blocked by the Lords,\" he said. </p> <p>On BBC1's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Blair said he would not use the Parliament Act to enforce the will of the Commons unless no further compromise could be found. </p> <p>It was an issue that had \"to be decided\" in the present parliament, he said.</p>",
  "As he stepped up to claim his silver medal, Amir Khan would scarcely have thought he would become the poster boy for government policy. <p>But the 18-year-old is the new thinking made flesh. </p> <p>Described as a \"hyperactive\" kid, he was continually involved in fights at school. At the age of eight he was taken by his despairing father to the Haliwell boxing club, which was just round the corner from his home. </p> <p>Once his potential was spotted there, he moved on to Bury amateur boxing club where, in keeping with the aspirations voiced by Mr Blunkett, he found a mentor in trainer Mick Jelley. </p> <p>Khan has admitted never really being able to focus on team sports such as football, cricket, rugby and athletics, but by 11 he was boxing competitively. Interviewed by the BBC this year, he said of the sport: \"It has changed my life and kept me focused. All my energies are used up at the gym.\" </p> <p>Jim Atkinson, the secretary and coach at the Fitzroy Lodge amateur boxing club, has submitted papers to the Home Office outlining the social benefits of boxing training. He said the elements which helped young people socialise were the acquisition of skills and the efforts they expend on building fitness. </p> <p>\"Boxing is an individual sport but whether one is seeking to compete or just going to the gym to train, they form, of necessity, a relationship with the people training them. The skills are extremely difficult to learn unless, like Amir Khan, you have phenomenal gifts of balance and coordination. The hard work involved and the time you pass in a club with a lot of other people who are also clearly working very hard leads to good social relationships.\" </p> <p>Mr Atkinson said he has seen the phenomenon work. \"I can think of people at our club who have come from parts of London where the majority of their friends have been in trouble with the law or are in jail, and they will say that the reason they are not is because they were involved with a boxing club from an early age. Every club can give examples of that sort. Just because it is a cliche doesn't mean it isn't true.\"</p>",
  "<p>Terry Newton faces the kind of nervous Monday morning with which he is all too familiar after a high tackle that left the St Helens coach Ian Millward fuming in this wild and woolly derby. </p> <p>Wigan's rugged hooker escaped immediate punishment from the referee Russell Smith despite poleaxing the Saints wing Ade Gardner early in the second half. But the Rugby Football League's video review panel retains the power to summon him to a disciplinary hearing tomorrow if it decides the tackle merits further investigation. </p> <p>The panel will also study a possible spear tackle by Wakefield's New Zealand inspiration David Solomon which was put on report after their dramatic win at Hull on Friday, leaving Solomona and Newton in danger of missing Friday's elimination semi-final between Trinity and the Warriors at the JJB Stadium. </p> <p>\"You've all seen Newton's tackle,\" said an angry Millward, who remains convinced that the Wigan hooker escaped lightly with a two-match suspension for felling Jon Wilkin when the teams last met in August. \"Russell Smith should have come and put a bolt in Ade Gardner's neck. The guy got his head knocked off.\" </p> <p>Newton angered the Australians with a couple of cheap shots during last year's Ashes series, yet he has been the best hooker in the Super League for two seasons now, and underlined his toughness on Saturday when he suffered a broken nose in the first few minutes to go with the dislocated thumb he brought into the game, but still played on. </p> <p>That presents a dilemma for Great Britain's new coach Brian Noble before the Tri-Nations series: is Newton's potent combination of skill and aggression worth the disciplinary risk? </p> <p>Noble will surely have no doubts about capping Sean O'Loughlin after another fine performance by Wigan's 21-year-old loose forward, who skipped around Paul Sculthorpe to create the match winning try for Andy Farrell, his captain and brother-in-law. </p> <p>But Wigan will need far more from their halfbacks Danny Orr and Adrian Lam if they are to beat Wakefield on Friday, never mind go on to win the Grand Final. The young substitute Luke Robinson, who will be offloaded to Salford at the end of the season and replaced by Warrington's Australian schemer Nathan Wood, presented a much greater threat to the Saints. </p> <p>They now have all winter to ponder a pair of crucial home try decisions by the video referee - both correct, but agonisingly marginal - in addition to a try-saving tackle by Kris Radlinski on Micky Higham that prevented them taking a 12-0 lead in the first half. </p> <p>But the way Chris Joynt was embraced by every one of his St Helens team-mates after the final hooter confirmed that for the most successful captain in the club's history this was the end of the road. </p> <p> <strong> Wigan Warriors:</strong> Radlinski; Aspinwall, Wild, Brown, Dallas; Orr, Lam; Farrell, Newton, C Smith, Hock, Tickle, O'Loughlin. <strong> Substitutes:</strong> O'Connor, Robinson, D Sculthorpe, Connolly. </p> <p><strong> Tries: </strong> Robinson, Brown, Farrell. <strong> Goals:</strong> Farrell 3. </p> <p><strong> St Helens:</strong> Wellens; Hardman, Talau, Albert, J Roby; Hooper, Long; Fozzard, Higham, Cunningham, Joynt, Gilmour, P Sculthorpe. </p> <p><strong> Substitutes:</strong> Gardner, Mason, Edmondson, Wilkin. </p> <p><strong> Try:</strong> Gardner. <strong> Goals:</strong> Long 4. </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> : R Smith (Castleford). </p> <p><strong> Attendance: </strong> 20,052.</p>",
  "<p>Saracens are living up to their unwanted reputation as the perennial underachievers of English rugby. Thanks to their owner, Nigel Wray, the club rarely lacks for enterprise yet on the field their opponents - in this case Leeds - tend to dictate terms to a hot-and-cold team that shows a worrying lack of tenacity. </p> <p>Sure, Saracens are missing talented players due to injury, but that is hardly sufficient excuse for such a supine home performance. In contrast, Leeds showed exactly the kind of blood and guts they needed to end a six-game losing streak and push themselves into ninth position. </p> <p>\"The key to winning was the way we generated momentum in the first half and regained control in the second,\" said their coach Phil Davies. \"We won good ball off the set-piece and showed a lot of self-belief.\" </p> <p>Leeds were excellent value for a 19-7 half-time lead due mainly to the pinpoint goal-kicking of Gordon Ross. The Leeds fly-half bears a strong stylistic resemblance - hands clasped, semi-crouching position - to Jonny Wilkinson and, like Wilko, he sends confidence surging through his team with the positive impetus of his all-round play. </p> <p>Saracens, who often struggled to get out of their own half, began to feel the heat in a 10-minute spell before half-time when Ross landed three penalties. </p> <p>Those penalties were fair reward for the grinding pressure exerted by the Leeds tight forwards who invariably tore the ball away in the close-quarter battle. </p> <p>Tom Palmer, Leeds' big bustling second row, proved an uncompromising leader, presenting the kind of quality ball that enabled his team-mates to retain possession with impressive composure. </p> <p>Saracens found it hard to capitalise on the undoubted skills of their back-row forwards, Richard Hill and Taine Randell, whose good work was frequently neutralised by Leeds' effective foraging in the second phase. Dan Scarbrough, the Saracens full-back, was also kept on the back foot by his former team-mates, notably the wing Tom Biggs who left him standing with a brisk sidestep en route to a 13th minute try in the corner. </p> <p>Sarries stayed in touch thanks to a slickly worked score three minutes later by Paul Bailey who rounded off a crisp cross-field transfer at the left flag. Nicky Little cut Saracens' 12-point deficit shortly after the break with a couple of timely penalties and, for a period, Leeds appeared to have lost the initiative. </p> <p>However, the solid Ross calmed their nerves on the hour with a splendid 50-metre penalty, his fifth of the day, to extend his team's lead to 22-13. </p> <p>In the closing stages Sara cens huffed and puffed to little avail and seven minutes from time Andre Snyman made victory safe with a brilliant solo try after twisting out of Little's tackle. </p> <p>Mystifyingly, though, the referee found seven minutes of added time which allowed Little to grab a short-range try and earn Saracens an undeserved bonus point for narrow-margin defeat. </p> <p> <strong> Saracens:</strong> Scarbrough; Haughton, Johnston, Sorrell, Bailey; Little, Williams (Rauluni, 61); Yates (Lloyd, 57), Ibanez (Cairns, 57), Broster, Chesney (Skiving, 70), Vyvyan (capt), Hill, Seymour, Randell. </p> <p><strong> Tries:</strong> Bailey, Little. <strong> Cons:</strong> Little 2. <strong> Pens:</strong> Little 3. </p> <p><strong> Leeds: </strong> Albanese; Rees (Stimpson, 57), Bell, Snyman, Biggs; Ross, Dickens; Shelley, Regan, Kerr, Hooper, Palmer (capt), Dunbar (Parks, 57), Rigney, Popham. </p> <p><strong> Tries:</strong> Biggs, Snyman. <strong> Cons:</strong> Ross 2. <strong> Pens: </strong> Ross 5. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> S Davey (Sussex). <strong> Attendance:</strong> 5,325.</p>",
  "<p>England's talismanic allrounder Andrew Flintoff is expected to announce today that he will follow the example set by his close friend Steve Harmison and withdraw from the one-day squad for the tour of Zimbabwe in November. </p> <p>And as last night's deadline approached for players to make themselves available for selection, Andrew Strauss admitted that Flintoff was not alone in having misgivings about playing cricket in a country that is being torn apart by Robert Mugabe. </p> <p>\"All the players have deep-rooted moral problems with going on the tour,\" he told BBC Online. \"It's not an easy situation for us to be in. The England and Wales Cricket Board is going to be sending out a cricket team to Zimbabwe - it's just a question of which personnel go. I can only speak for myself and I haven't made up my mind yet.\" </p> <p>Strauss's comments were another twist in the build-up to the announcement of the 14-man squad, which will be named on the ECB website at 2.30pm tomorrow. And they followed newspaper speculation about a disagreement in the England hierarchy concerning selection policy. </p> <p>Whereas the coach Duncan Fletcher is reportedly keen to rest key players before the five-Test tour of South Africa starting in December, the chairman of the ECB, David Morgan, is keen for the selectors to pick their best side - including Flintoff, who is known to have strong reservations about making the trip. England's standing in the international community plummeted last year when they withdrew from their World Cup fixture in Zimbabwe, and Morgan does not want to risk further censure by sending an understrength team. </p> <p>David Graveney, the England chairman of selectors, yesterday played down rumours of a rift and insisted that Harmison remained the only player to have indicated that he would not be going to Zimbabwe. </p> <p>But in an allusion to the bone spur that prevented Flintoff from bowling during the NatWest Series in June and July, Graveney said that the make-up of the side \"is subject to fitness, and a number of players have been carrying injuries this summer. </p> <p>\"The core players have been on the road playing constant international cricket for a long time. The tour of Zimbabwe gives us an opportunity to rotate a little more.\" He added that the squad might contain \"one or two\" surprises. </p> <p>The generalities in which Graveney spoke might be intended to leave the door open for Flintoff and other senior players to opt out at the last moment. </p> <p>And yesterday it was clear that a complex situation remained unresolved. \"The selectors are still talking with the management committee of the ECB about the make-up of the squad,\" said the players' representative Richard Bevan. </p> <p>Finding out exactly who thinks what has not been made easier by the fact that the England captain Michael Vaughan has asked his players to toe the ECB line and make themselves available because of the risk of ICC sanctions. </p> <p>One report yesterday claimed that Vaughan had been unhappy that Harmison had jumped the gun by announcing his withdrawal from the tour on moral grounds after England's win over Sri Lanka in the ICC Champions Trophy nine days ago. It quoted a team insider as saying: \"Harmy kicked a hole in the dam and raised the possibility of division within the camp.\" </p> <p>But Vaughan will at least be comforted by the knowledge that Marcus Trescothick, who hit 104 in England's nail-biting two-wicket defeat by West Indies in the final of the Champions Trophy on Saturday, has publicly declared himself available to make the trip, although he admitted that it was \"hard to judge\" whether England's top players could do with a break before the South Africa series. </p> <p>\"There are several weeks now until the start of the Zimbabwe trip,\" he said. \"That should be a long enough break, but we'll only really know at the end of the South Africa tour.\" </p> <p>The ECB has said all along that no individual would be penalised for opting out of the Zimbabwe tour for moral reasons. The ICC's hearing into alleged racism in Zimbabwe cricket, scheduled to start on Wednesday, may yet take the issue out of the board's hands. But if Flintoff and others do pull out, the ECB may have to reiterate its commendable public stance through gritted teeth.</p>",
  "<p>A record to be proud of. Unemployment down by more than a million, growth averaging a shade under 3%, inflation below 2%, borrowing costs at their lowest for a generation. Labour today? No, that was John Major's economic record when his government went into meltdown at the 1997 election. </p> <p>Today Gordon Brown will stand up and say much the same as Kenneth Clarke said in the autumn of 1996: the economy is in fine fettle so why risk it by voting for the other lot? The background to Tony Blair's first landslide, however, shows there is reason to treat with caution the assumption that governments with a good story to tell on the economy inevitably win. They don't. </p> <p>Indeed, the worrying thing for Labour is that on current performance it is on course to secure a smaller percentage of the vote than Jim Callaghan did in the aftermath of the Winter of Discontent. So, does the economy no longer matter? The answer is that it does, but not in the simplistic way that has always been assumed. </p> <p>The good news for the government is that, unlike in 1970 and 1979, there is no compelling economic reason to kick Labour out of power. Political scientists have endlessly debated why the Conservative party enjoyed hegemony for most of the 20th century even though the class make-up of the electorate would have suggested governments of the left should have had primacy. One reason, perhaps, is that every time a government of the left did get into power it was blown away by a financial crisis, not always of its own making. The electorate thought Labour's heart was in the right place but doubted its competence to manage the economy as well as the Conservatives. </p> <p>Over the past seven years there has been nothing remotely to compare with the gold standard crisis of 1931 or the arrival of the International Monetary Fund in 1976, and thus no reason for voters to veer back towards a Conservative party which itself was in power for Black Wednesday, the most recent - and in many ways least excusable - of the UK's five emblematic financial disasters of the 20th century. </p> <p>Brown's greatest political achievement since 1997 has been to ensure that nothing has gone wrong. The big economic numbers - growth, unemployment and inflation - have been well behaved even if some of the component parts of the economy still give cause for concern. </p> <p>Labour's macro-economic framework, a refinement of that bequeathed by the Tories, has worked. The Bank of England's management of interest rates has been exemplary, with not a single month in which inflation has deviated more than one percentage point from its target. Brown's economic management means Tony Blair has been the one Labour prime minister not to preside over an economic crisis involving a run on the pound, devaluation or an unwanted visit from the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p>The political consequences of this economic and financial stability should not be underestimated. At this stage in the 1964-70 and 1974-79 governments, public spending was being cut following financial crises in mid-term, rather than being increased. If Labour's poll ratings look feeble at the moment, it can only be imagined the depths to which they would have sunk if Brown was now announcing a package of public spending cuts. </p> <p>The intriguing question, though, is why Labour's poll ratings should be as low as they are. Here's the bad news - really bad news - for the government. A poll conducted by YouGov for the Economist last week showed that 60% of voters thought they had not prospered under Labour and about the same proportion that the increases in public spending had made no difference to their lives. That's despite the fact that two-thirds of voters, and an even higher proportion of the middle classes, thought they were paying higher taxes. These are worrying findings. </p> <p>One explanation is that, despite the economic statistics, voters really are no better off after seven years of Labour. Another is that the public takes a well-functioning economy for granted after 12 years in which inflation and unemployment have fallen, growth has been robust and interest rates remained low. Governments, in other words, receive little or no credit for getting things right on the economy, but are still liable to carry the can if things go wrong. </p> <p>A third explanation is that Iraq has been so omnipresent in the past two years that it has drowned out every other aspect of government policy. This possibility was foreseen by some senior Labour figures, including Brown, during the build-up to war, and the political cost to the government has been enormous, especially among women voters. </p> <p>A survey for the Fawcett Society released yesterday found that 60% of women are unhappy with the job that Blair is doing and 63% of women are dissatisfied with the government's performance overall. Despite the extra billions pumped into healthcare, 38% of women think the NHS will deteriorate over the next few years while confidence in the prime minister is now as low as that experienced by Margaret Thatcher in the last 18 months of her premiership. </p> <p>Brown and his team view the draining away of trust with alarm. The fact that today's speech will focus on the need for unity suggests that the chancellor is not one of those who sees a third Labour victory as in the bag. What he will also be stressing is the need for the government to map out a progressive agenda for its third term, showing how economic stability can be the platform for full employment, even in the hard-core areas of joblessness, for low-cost housing and to better the lives of children. </p> <p>The hidden subtext of this is that Labour needs to reconnect with the voters, starting with its own natural supporters. Brown's argument is that, despite its two landslides, a demoralised opposition and a strong economy, Labour has failed to change the political landscape in any real sense. Even worse, it appears to see virtue in showing political virility by campaigning against its own supporters on issues such as foundation hospitals and top-up fees. </p> <p>The government's position is this: It has squandered the trust of the electorate to the extent where disillusionment is rife; it has so far failed to sketch out its own distinct ideology; it has failed to cash in on its economic record but is utterly dependent on the economy staying strong over the next six months. </p> <p>There is no immediate prospect of a recession, but growth is weakening, not strengthening, and there are at least half a dozen risks ahead. These are falling house prices, the size of the government's budget deficit, the weakness of productivity, the trade deficit, the squeeze on real incomes from rising petrol prices and dearer mortgages, and the loss of manufacturing jobs. </p> <p>Of these, the key ones are property, the budget deficit and real incomes. House prices are falling, and should they continue to do so that would only amplify the feelbad factor. Ditto the squeeze on real incomes from higher oil prices. </p> <p>Although any tax increases caused by the bigger than expected deficit would be delayed until the third term, that will not prevent the Conservatives banging on about it from here until polling day. If house prices are falling at the same time, Labour's poll lead, already small, could be completely eroded. So, it is no time for complacency. The election is not done and dusted. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The forthcoming battle between the Beckhams and the News of the World has all the ingredients to keep the lives of David and Posh at the forefront of the public eye - for probably all the wrong reasons - for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>The media darlings of recent years are taking on some of the very people who gave them the profile they courted. The Beckhams' lawyers, Harbottle and Lewis, a respected media firm, issued a statement on September 21 confirming proceedings had been initiated against the News of the World over an article claiming their marriage was in trouble or \"on the rocks\".</p> <p>Any claim the Beckhams make will be based on defamation of character. Privacy does not appear to play a part, and besides, if the claim were for privacy under the law of confidence, the story would have to be true, which is something the Beckhams have already denied.</p> <p>So what is the nature of their complaint? The claim is that the News of the World allegations were untrue and defamatory. Some people would say that a reference to a marriage being in difficulties is not itself defamatory. After all, these things happen.</p> <p>However the Beckhams have always gone to great lengths to emphasise their image of happy family life, despite the enormous pressures they are under as a couple and as individuals.</p> <p>Strictly speaking their image shouldn't make a difference in the eyes of the law, but perhaps here it might. In any event, their lawyers will no doubt be crafting claims relating to specific allegations. These were reportedly from a source who alleged the couple were constantly fighting and that Posh thought David had \"lost it as a husband\". All of these allegations will be the subject of factual evidence, which is surely not something the Beckhams would want to subject themselves to.</p> <p>In all of this the defamatory meaning is not obvious. Indeed, rather than think the worse of either of them, many would have sympathy with their plight. The legal arguments over the defamatory meaning of the comments that the Beckhams complain of will be interesting to follow.</p> <p>But surely the biggest problem they face - and the one of most public interest - is the News of the World's recent Rebecca Loos story. This alleged that Posh will never forgive Becks over his affair with Ms Loos. That's not surprising, but nor is it defamatory. If the Beckhams sue the News of the World over this, the whole Loos episode will be opened up once more - but this time in even more detail, with the prospect of David having to give evidence himself. I can't see it. </p> <p>The Beckhams had their chance to sue over the Rebecca Loos story but didn't. Now there is doubt that the story was defamatory (if untrue). They had the chance to injunct and to sue various media (and Loos herself) as the story rumbled on and the allegations were repeated. Neither occurred, which was telling. </p> <p>Now we see them suing on a weaker libel that draws back on the Loos story. It's very difficult to see how the Beckhams can win and one suspects the News of the World has weighed all this up. No doubt the newspaper has confidence in its source, but one suspects that even if the source is flaky, the Loos history will come home to roost. </p> <p>The worst case scenario for the News of the World is that it got it wrong, in which case it could find itself paying damages of say \u00a3100,000 maximum plus costs of around \u00a3400,000. This is not cheap, but if the newspaper thinks it will win and believes it will get widespread exposure and a legitimate insight into the Beckhams' lifestyle along the way, then the benefits may well outweigh the risks.</p> <p>Will the Beckhams go through with their threat to sue? It appears they already have. However, to do so in the public eye is a risky business. If they decide to drop their claim, how do they do so without losing face?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Damian Crosse is a media litigation partner at DLA</p>",
  "<p>'Don't I recognise you?\" came a softly spoken American lady's voice as I was taking breakfast with my brother in Edinburgh. \"Yes, yes indeed. How lovely to see you again,\" I replied. \"Let me introduce you to my brother. Richard, this is Monica Lewinsky. Monica, this is Richard.\" </p> <p>A lovely lady, Monica Lewinsky, but why oh why did I decide, as marketing director of Channel Five, to pay her to endorse the station? Admittedly, I've not always been the sharpest pencil in the box, but really. </p> <p>I got away with it though. Just. In those days, only Dyke, Elstein, Airey and I actually watched the channel, plus it was seen as a bit of a typical \"cheeky chappy\" Channel Five act. But I'll be honest. I didn't mention it in my last interview with Barclays. I don't imagine the brain behind using Rebecca Loos to endorse Debenhams will be putting that at the top of their \"insightful moments\" list either. </p> <p>We all do it but why on earth do we persist in using celebrities to endorse our brands when it often doesn't work? </p> <p>The first clue is to interrogate the word celebrity. A broad definition might be something along the lines of \"a person who catches the public's imagination through talent\". So Lewinsky and Loos are struck off immediately. A clear case of infamy, not fame, has propelled these people onto the red carpet of film premieres and more unfortunately into TV or poster campaigns. </p> <p>It doesn't work and never will. Consumers aren't buffoons. They are more marketing savvy than ever before. They understand and accept that companies will pay for celebrities to endorse their products. They even enjoy and embrace these types of campaigns. But there are some rules the marketing community has to follow if it wants consumers to bridge the potential gap between the use of a celebrity and a subsequent purchase. And, as I learnt with Monica and Debenhams will surely learn with Rebecca Loos, consumers expect their celebrities to have a point. </p> <p>Credibility follows closely on the heels of talent. Elton John has talent, no question, but he's also very grand. When you employ an A List celebrity, it's imperative you have a watertight contract, ensuring plenty of shooting time. Otherwise, you end up with a campaign like Sky TV's \"Are you ready?\" marketing the start of last year's football season. Sky has historically created the greatest sports trailers in the world, but \"Are you ready?\" left the sports fan with the distinct feeling that Elton was ready ... to leave the shoot after a couple of hours. One of the main reasons Nike's campaigns have worked so well is that the scripts are visually complex and the sports stars they use have had to spend at least a day on set. Consumers can spot short cuts a mile off. </p> <p>David Beckham clearly has a talent, so we can say that particular box is ticked. But David, how many brands do you and your advisers think you can endorse before you lose all credibility with the buying public? He's entitled to profit from generous marketing benefactors (although the damage to his own brand as a consequence is worthy of debate). It's the brand owners who need to question themselves. Surely, if you're Vodafone, you wince when you see Becks drinking a Pepsi in a gladiatorial skirt? Surely if you're Gillette, you shudder as you see Becks taking a photo with the new Vodafone handset? And so it goes on. </p> <p>They'll argue that each category and each product is different, but they're hardly appealing to different target audiences. You put the same message in front of consumers and the message becomes eroded. You use a prominent footballer to be your brand spokesman and you lose credibility. Ditto, if that celebrity can't act. </p> <p>The way Walkers Crisps and Gary Lineker have developed their relationship contrasts starkly with the ubiquitous Becks, and both have benefited. Lineker is a one-brand spokesman and his performances have evolved to such a standard that the ads have become mini-films in their own right. </p> <p>Finally, the use of a celebrity has to be relevant. They have to fit the product. ITV use stars in between shows to endorse the channel in a relevant, credible and engaging way. OK, I admit my team at ITV was responsible for this, but if I admit to Monica, can't I claim credit for Ant and Dec?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Jim Hytner is the group brand and UK marketing director of Barclays</p>",
  "<p><strong>A word in the new Radio 4 chief's ear </strong></p> <p>In some respects, controlling BBC Radio 4 is the most thankless job in broadcasting. It is so successful, so established , so \"much-loved\" that the clammy breath of suffocating approval blows over it like the dank air in an undertaker's parlour. And - as the newly appointed controller, my friend Mark Damazer will discover if he does not sense already - a thousand Gorgons stand, fully armed with pens writing in all the colours of certified sanity, to defend each junction, signpost, each utterance of Peter Donaldson to the last syllable of recorded time. </p> <p>I joke, of course, but not much. At least Damazer has two useful examples, in his immediate predecessors, James Boyle and Helen Boaden, of what not to do. Boyle was the systems-based interventionist. He knew what the network should be better than the listeners. This was both high-handed and patronising. </p> <p>Boaden was far cleverer, projecting an impression of masterly inactivity veiled in a haze of sheer niceness. But she had imagination and flair, conjuring programmes - often the 15-minuters - of real wit. </p> <p>So, Mark, since you can't be another Boaden, and should not be another Boyle, what's left? More than you might think. </p> <p>Challenge the drearily predictable, like most of the 9am slots. Find out why the 11pm slot, which once used to spring delicious light entertainment surprises, is now plain odd. Ask why Fi Glover has lost her sparkle on Broadcasting House and Eddie Mair never quite found it on PM. </p> <p>And challenge every news sequence editor to avoid the predictable, to be fantastical or curious, to chance their arm. There are very few new programme formats around. But even the staidest formats can be reinvigorated by new editors and - dare I say it - new presenters. But of course, it is the old presenters that we love. (I suppose you could get rid of Humphrys, but I would not like to be the one to try.) </p> <p>You would be foolish to cull - that's not needed. But some sound bored after simply years in the job. </p> <p>So a quiet word here, a nudge there, approval of broadcasting with a smile there, a demand that if producers and editors interest you, then that will probably suit the listeners too. It may not be dramatic; but it will be effective. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> John Tusa, broadcaster and former head of BBC World Service </p> <p><strong> The plight of the Post woman </strong><br> </p> <p> It was the worst present for a 250th birthday party. The Yorkshire Post has rounded off its celebrations by seeing its bright new editor clear her desk. Rachael Campey's one-way ticket back to London highlights the dilemma of regional morning papers - grand old pillars of the community which are starting to look like archaeological remains. </p> <p>Like all but two of the 18 surviving titles, the Post's sales have been on the slide, down 4.5% this year to 61,691. Campey presided over 18 months of change designed to stem this. The result has been staff misery such that journalists passed a vote of no confidence in her in February. </p> <p>One Post executive described the roller coaster ride as \"plunging about,\" a phrase that sums up regional morning papers' wider struggle to redefine their role. Campey axed obvious targets such as recycled op-ed pieces from the London Evening Standard, but replaced them with regional writers such as Austin Mitchell and Bernard Ingham, who to put it mildly are not new. The extended letters page has had the same provincialising effect, making \"Yorkshire's national newspaper\" seem more of a parish magazine. Yet the Post is hostile to a regional assembly. It appears neither national fish nor regional fowl, while Campey's brief to build a \"dream team\" proved a red herring. </p> <p>The staff now want a safe pair of hands and a healer. Johnston Press, the owners, will be tempted to draw on their experienced editors - they have 240 regional papers - and plump for someone like Peter Charlton of the Sheffield Star. But where next? The wider question remains unanswered - as it does, even more urgently, at papers such as the Birmingham Post, which has slipped to a hair-raising 14,360 daily sales. </p> <p>The big asset is trust. Regional papers far outstripped the national media in a survey this month of reader confidence in their integrity. Training bright young journalists is also a strong card - and making bold use of them. Both were exploited by Campey's predecessor, Tony Watson, now editorial director of the Press Association. His 13 years were among the paper's best. What he never got - and what other regional mornings most need - was the budget to build on these virtues. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Martin Wainwright </p> <p><strong> Why US shows will be cheaper</strong><br> </p> <p> Buying US TV shows and films for British broadcasters used to be one of the cushiest jobs in TV land. Every May the UK TV-buyers would jet out to Los Angeles for the LA screenings, when Hollywood studios show their new shows to foreign broadcasters for the first time. After watching a few videos and writing a couple of cheques, the Brits would spend the rest of their week on the west coast topping up their tan round the rooftop pool at the Beverly Wilshire. </p> <p>Not any more. With the proliferation of digital media in recent years, UK buyers now have to get involved in ever more complex negotiations with the studios about \"rights windows\" - the industry term for the agreed period in which a broadcaster, or other rights buyer, can transmit a particular show or film. As well as pay-per-view, pay-TV and free-to-air broadcasting windows, the studios and broadcasters now haggle over DVD and new media rights. </p> <p>Broadband is also becoming an issue in rights deals. If a British broadcaster is negotiating to buy a TV show from Time Warner's US cable channel HBO - home of The Sopranos, Sex and the City and Deadwood - they will want assurance, in the contract, that it won't be available to UK broadband subscribers via another Time Warner subsidiary, AOL, before they have transmitted it. </p> <p>\"The contracts get thicker and the negotiations get longer. Fifteen years ago there was just free-to-air TV - it was really easy,\" admits Jeff Ford, Five controller of acquisitions, who has just closed a film deal with MGM and bought a bunch of reality shows from various US broadcasters. </p> <p>Ford adds that the phenomenal success of DVD has made a particularly big difference to his job. \"With a film like Lord of the Rings, you can have millions of people buying it on DVD in the UK. So are they still going to watch it when it comes onto a terrestrial TV channel? Probably not,\" he says. </p> <p>George McGhee, BBC controller of acquisitions, says that the growth of rights windows \"certainly makes proof reading contracts more complex\". He adds: \"It's become more common now to buy all rights, or pay extra for exclusivity, or for the studio to hold back some rights [such as DVD or new media].\" </p> <p>However, both Ford and McGhee agree that there is a least one potential benefit to haggling over DVD and broadband rights - it should mean the cost of buying American comes down for British broadcasters. </p> <p>\"If more people are going to be watching a show or film on DVD or broadband before I get to broadcast it, then the value to me goes down. That should force prices down,\" says Ford. McGhee adds: \"If the studios are making 80% of their profit from DVD and video, they can't expect TV to pay as much.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Jason Deans </p> <p><strong> A comment too far</strong><br> </p> <p> Mark Law was sacked as comment editor of the Sunday Telegraph last week after firing off a characteristically blunt email to his managing director, Hugo Drayton. His email was a response to an all-staff memo asking for ideas to improve the newspaper group before the new chief executive, Murdoch MacLennan, joined. Law saw red because his efforts to suggest simple solutions to problems had in the past become mired in bureaucracy - most notably the time he tried to get the office vending machines to accept pound coins instead of notes. A copy of an email from Mark Law to Hugo Drayton was sent anonymously to MediaGuardian. It said: </p> <p>\"Thank you for your memo concerning passion, pride and the dawn of a new future. It has caused a great deal of mirth. Does no one advise you on the tone of these memos? </p> <p>\"Some time ago I made an extremely sensible suggestion. It was not until staff had suffered enormous inconvenience and wasted time that you managed to persuade the relevant department to get it fixed. It took the combined rudeness and ineffectiveness of yourself, Peter Lohmeyer, Dominic Lawson, Lynn Cunningham, Con Coughlin and Kim Fletcher to fail to address the problem. I told you the precise nature of the problem and even its causes. Frankly it was a pathetic performance on all your parts. </p> <p>\"The problem was, I read, incredibly easy to solve. Incidentally, somebody said that the Guardian would reveal the solution in all its simplicity. </p> <p>\"Anyway it took a further time-wasting petition among the staff to bring the fatuousness to some conclusion. Now there may be some perfectly good reasons for your inaction: maybe you were all too busy brown-nosing Dan Colson and drawing up the grotesquely large budget to pay for a farewell to this tiresome man who has done so little for this company. But I do not know them. </p> <p>\"Anyway, given that it takes four months to get anything done and you seem so keen to impress Murdoch MacLennan as soon as he arrives, are you really in the market for suggestions? And if you are so keen now, why weren't you when I first made my suggestion?\"</p>",

  "<p>It is a great honour to be standing in for the esteemed Roy Greenslade. It is also a great pleasure, since I intend to take advantage of his absence by giving Roy - and others - a gentle kicking. It must by now be obvious to anyone who has read the Butler report, and the final chapter of Greg Dyke's memoirs, Inside Story, that there took place, in 2003, a grave injustice. </p> <p>A BBC radio reporter had a scoop. As anyone who has produced such a thing will know, these are hard to come by, hard to spot for what they are, and hard to get right first time; and yet he did. Andrew Gilligan revealed that there was alarm in the world of spooks at the way No 10 had embellished data about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, in particular, the so-called 45-minute claim. He also revealed that Alastair Campbell was involved in these embellishments. </p> <p>Since the WMD were just beginning their chronic and embarrassing no-show, the story prompted Campbell to launch a frenzied ad hominem attack on Gilligan, and anyone at the BBC who defended him. </p> <p>The Beeb behaved like some vast halfwitted ruminant confronted by a velociraptor. Gilligan was sacrificed, and after Hutton produced his ludicrous report, Dyke and the corporation's chairman Gavyn Davies followed him out of the door, both still protesting that the story was right in all essential respects. </p> <p>And so it was. The more we have learned about Gilligan's story, the closer his report appears to have been to the unvarnished truth. </p> <p>Yes, the Downing St spin machine sexed up the dossier on WMD, materially altering the text in several places so as to exaggerate the threat posed by Saddam. </p> <p>Yes, the intention was to persuade the wretched, lobotomised Labour backbenchers to vote for the war. Yes, the perpetrators knew exactly what they were doing in going beyond the construction placed on the data by the spies themselves. Yes, Campbell was the mastermind of this process. Yes, there was anxiety at senior level in the intelligence services. All that is now super-abundantly clear. </p> <p>But in the early stages of the row the whole of the media - and all the illustrious commentators - had to make a decision, based on instinct. </p> <p>Did they defend the reporter? Or did they defend the most mendacious government in modern memory? It is a matter of eternal regret that so many decided to beat up Gilligan and give Campbell the benefit of the doubt. Some of them did so because they just believed that the war was right, and that the end - getting rid of Saddam and making the world a better place - justified the means (a bit of statesmanlike lying about WMD). </p> <p>Some of them were partly cheerleaders for Campbell and Blair and in this category I put Roy, who is known to my Spectator colleague Stephen Glover as Roy Campbell-Greenslade. </p> <p>Some of the anti-Gilligan brigade are among my best journalistic friends and most admired colleagues. It doesn't matter. They were wrong. They must now be named, so that they can face up to their error. Michael Gove - wrong. Janet Daley - wrong. Tom Baldwin - wrong. The leader writers of the Times and Telegraph - wrong. Barbara Amiel - utterly wrong. Martin Kettle - completely hopeless. John Lloyd - a total shower. Charles Moore - right in so many wonderful ways, but on this, alas, wrong, wrong, wrong. </p> <p>I do not ask for any old-fashioned punishment or act of contrition. It would be nice if they all made a pilgrimage on their knees to Gilligan's current place of work, as the Spectator's defence and diplomatic editor, scourging themselves the while with rolled-up copies of the magazine. We must hope that it is enough that the public has been here reminded who they are and of the mistake they made. </p> <p>In an age when journalists are turning into quasi-politicians, appearing as co-equals on programmes such as Question Time, it is right that they should be ruthlessly monitored by each other. That is the function of a media column, a genre that did not exist 20 years ago, and which has grown along with the egos, picture bylines and general importance and self-importance of journos. </p> <p>I use this hallowed Greenslade slot to make this point, because I am confident that Roy would not mind, and also confident that he could not be quite relied upon to make it himself. If he wishes to atone, I suggest he join the movement to call Blair to account and make him explain exactly why he lied about WMD. This can be found at <a href=\"http://www.impeachblair.org\">www.impeachblair.org</a>.</p> <p><strong> Are terrorists manipulating our media?</strong><br> I blame the media, says Blair. According to Tony in yesterday's Observer, his difficulties in Iraq are being greatly exacerbated by the terrorist ability to \"manipulate the modern media\". Let us leave aside the absurdity that this prime minister, of all prime ministers, should accuse anyone of such manipulation. We must accept that he has a point. That is how terrorism works. The more hysterical the Daily Mail headlines, the greater the public revulsion at the war in Iraq, and the greater the terrorist success. The more fuss we make about the threatened beheading of our nationals, the greater the terrorist incentive to terror. It is very difficult, however, to see where the responsible editor should draw the line. Iraq is a war zone, numberless Iraqis are dying, people are being beheaded live on the internet. Is it being \"manipulated\" to publish those facts? To suppress them would be lying. </p> <p><strong> Come over to our side, Polly</strong><br> I developed a kind of pathetic crush on Polly Toynbee when she and I once did a TV series together. So it was one of my proudest moments when I wrote a piece of liberal imperialism about the Muslim approach to women, and then found she wrote a virtually identical piece two days later. But honestly, Polly, what was that bilge you wrote last week in the Guardian about hunting? You kick off with some cheap sneers at toffs and pseudo-toffs on the Telegraph, but then do a jack-knife turn into a limp defence of hunting. Come on baby, you're either in favour of liberty or you aren't. If you're against the ban, you are shooting from the same trench as me, Charles Moore, and the toffs of the Telegraph. </p> <p><strong> Keep out of the royal houses</strong><br> Is there anything more eye-wateringly pointless than these elaborate \"security breaches\" in which reporters from the tabloids or the Sunday Times see how long they can pose as royal valets, butlers, footmen etc? I vote we cease all follow-up reporting of their antics. The Spectator is mounting a series of counter breaches, by which members of the royal family penetrate the offices of big newspaper groups. Ella Windsor has already successfully gained admission to the Mail on Sunday. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7 </strong> Roy Greenslade is away</p>",
  "<p>Just write about trends in television,\" says the impatient woman from the Guardian in a tone of voice normally reserved for first formers and people who buy the Independent. </p> <p>Has she got me confused with someone else? The closest I've been to a \"trend\" in television is the fashion for facial hair and combining open-neck pink shirts with tweed jackets that swept through Channel 4 a couple of summers ago. It's been back to jeans and T-shirts since July, I'm happy to report. </p> <p>In a panic, I spend almost seven minutes reading last week's Broadcast cover to cover in an attempt to glean something vaguely insightful to plagiarise. Learn nothing but feel a lot better. Seems I'm not the only one without a clue about \"the next big thing in television\". </p> <p>Decide to do what I always do when a decision needs to be made. I ring Baz. </p> <p>\"Pay attention, Lygo,\" he barks. \"I shall say this only once. \"Lorraine, Stuart and Nigel are out. Roly, Janice and you are in. Dan is in on Tuesdays but out every other day. Graham and Ben F are out but in. Dale is out but out. Reality is the new drama. Daytime is the new peaktime. Clunes is the new Pickard. A pygmy chimp with a calculator is the new Charles Allen. And Mark Thompson is the new everything he cares to claim the credit for.\" </p> <p>We discuss Endemol's quota of gifted Channel 4 capacity for the week ahead - including a drama documentary on the development of yellow fat spreads. And then Baz gives me permission to put the phone down and go to the bathroom. </p> <p>Send round an email to canvass ideas from the commissioning team at Channel 4, but they've long ago given up all pretence of thinking for themselves and the response is a deafening silence, apart from some bickering between the boys in documentaries and factual entertainment about who's got the biggest \"next big thing\" in TV. </p> <p>Desperate times call for desperate measures so I get under the desk and flick through my bootleg copy of the Living TV schedule for the month ahead. No executive relief is forthcoming. It's all still pink programming, the paranormal and penis skinning. So last year. </p> <p>Bereft of inspiration, there's nothing for it but to do the unthinkable and affect seriousness. So here, for the benefit of those still reading, are my top 10 theories on future trends. </p> <p><strong> 1</strong> John Humphrys is going to get a great deal grumpier. The yobbish 'chavs' have developed a taste for seeing themselves and all their technicolour vices on television and are here to stay. Learn to live with it, John, or lose the remote control down the back of the sofa for another five years. </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> The Ofcom salary budget will rise in inverse proportion to the number of hours of arts and religious programming on terrestrial television. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong>Channel Five will have a breakthrough hit. Eventually. But nobody may notice ... </p> <p><strong> 4 </strong>The BBC will be forced to sell the corporate Jacuzzi. </p> <p><strong> 5 </strong>You'll hear a lot from the BBC over the next year about Building Public Value, but nobody in White City is going to be cancelling their subscriptions to the Barb overnights just yet. There'll be as much lifestyle and acquired programming on BBC TV next year as this. </p> <p><strong> 6</strong> At the end of Charter Renewal there will still be more people working in BBC People (that's human resources or personnel to you and me) than on the entire Channel 4 payroll. </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> ITV will blame the Olympics, Big Brother, \"leaves on the line\" and \"the wrong kind of snow\" for their loss of audience share in 2004. They will refuse to pay any money back to advertisers, claiming they had their fingers crossed behind their backs when they signed the contract rights deal. </p> <p><strong> 8 </strong>Channel 4 programme titles will continue to get sillier and more attention seeking. Everyone at Channel 4 is going to start being a lot more respectful to the marketing department. </p> <p><strong> 9 </strong>Sky One will unveil its 19th new programme strategy since 2001. </p> <p><strong> 10 </strong>Greg Dyke will stand for parliament. </p> <p><strong> 10a </strong>Free Rad, a new platform to receive TV through your radiator, will be a cornerstone of UK TV's expansion policy. </p> <p><strong> 10b </strong>EastEnders will go the same way as Brookside. The only question is when ... </p> <p><strong> 10c </strong>We're all doomed. But some of us are more doomed than others. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Kevin Lygo is director of television at Channel 4</p>",
  "<p><strong> Meeting deadlines</strong><br> Many advertising, marketing and PR agencies would be much more productive for clients if they reduced the time spent in meetings. You need discipline to avoid a culture where you spend more time talking about what you are going to do than actually doing it. Of course only the second thing stands a chance of influencing the outside world. When we arrange a meeting we try to agree the start and end times in advance. </p> <p>Fortunately there are signs of a swing to faster decision-making. Contacts who visited the annual Marketing Forum on the ship Aurora this month spoke positively of the \"speed-dating\" system on board that allowed clients to meet dozens of potential suppliers over a couple of days. </p> <p>Now I see that the Media Trust is holding a \"speed-matching\" event at Channel 4 tomorrow which aims to pair charities with communications people willing to offer their services voluntarily. So bring on the \"speed-business\" culture. </p> <p> <strong> Martin Loat, director, Propeller PR &amp; Communications</strong> </p> <p><strong> We're not sub-standard</strong><br> So Andrew Marr believes that sub-editors \"with their own blind spots and unexamined prejudices\" often cut \"the most interesting or significant piece of news down to a few lines\" - (Between the lines, MediaGuardian September 20). You obviously didn't employ any good subs when you were a newspaper editor, Andrew. </p> <p> <strong> Janette Whaley, Guildford</strong> </p> <p><strong> When stardust gets tarnished</strong><br> I enjoyed Belinda Archer's article on celebrity endorsement (Crunch decision, Inside Marketing/PR, September 13). It's true that an endorsement transfers a celebrity's brand values to a product or service. But the process works in the other direction as well. One explanation for some of the \"over-protective\" parties you mention (which may or may not, I suppose, include agencies such as my employer) is that the brand's associations rub off on to the celebrity's brand, too. Therefore, a celebrity's agent or advocate has to consider issues of brand confusion, or even dilution if the celebrity endorses too many or disparate products. Even worse, should a brand be found to be lacking or involved in some kind of corporate or consumer scandal, the endorser is likewise affected. </p> <p>But, from a marketer's perspective, there are advantages of celebrity endorsement that go beyond the obvious objective to increase awareness of a brand. A powerful celebrity campaign can strongly affect another important stage in the consumer's decision-making process, that of brand preference. After all, virtually everyone is aware of Coca-Cola, but the company nevertheless spends millions on celebrity endorsement in order to tweak that crucial decision when one is standing in the grocery aisle staring at endless choices of beverages. </p> <p> <strong> Adam Kingl, marketing and development director, Deborah McKenna Ltd</strong> </p> <p><strong> Animal welfare has been our priority</strong><br> Over the past month, Five and Endemol UK have encountered some interesting issues in the making of The Farm, a new factual entertainment show where celebrities face the harsh realities of life on a working farm in Wiltshire. In particular, we've been surprised by organisations like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals who have fallen over themselves to criticise us over the style and content of the programme without having actually seen it (it's a nightly show which only started last night). </p> <p>Naturally Five, as a responsible broadcaster, and Endemol UK, one of the country's most respected and experienced production companies, have ensured that the welfare of animals has always been paramount. Our chosen farm is recognised as having the highest animal welfare standards. </p> <p>Our farmer and consultant Richard Guy is also the chairman of The Real Meat Company, which is dedicated to providing a genuine source of meat and poultry where welfare, purity and eating quality are the top priorities. Our celebrities are working to his high standards and treating all livestock with the utmost care and compassion. </p> <p>It's frustrating when broadcasters and producers are pressurised by campaigners more interested in jumping to conclusions and going to the press rather than entering into an informed dialogue with programme makers. I believe we have a programme that I'm really proud of which is not only entertaining but educating too. I hope that the people who criticised us in advance now feel that their worst fears were unjustified. </p> <p> <strong> Dan Chambers, director of programmes, Five</strong> </p> <p><strong> Time for a screen break</strong><br> Why are so many old men angry about television?

Turning around Maxim's ailing sales - down 7% to 227,017 - will be tougher. </p> <p><strong> Sony DAB</strong><br> Sony's entry into the digital radio market is proof that the medium has come of age. The portable XDR-S1 - complete with AM and FM settings - goes on sale at the end of this month. With nearly 700,000 digital sets sold in the UK, there really is no turning back. </p> <p><strong> Lauren Laverne</strong><br> Former singer with punk pop band Kenickie at the height of Britpop, Laverne hosts the drivetime show on London radio station Xfm and fronts a new music show on ITV. A mixture of glamour, attitude and access to the stars, meet the next Zo\u00eb Ball. </p> <p><strong> News of the World</strong><br> Britain's biggest-selling paper is having a purple patch, from scoops about David Beckham to the double affair at the heart of the FA. Editor Andy Coulson will want those scoops translated into sales - circulation was down nearly 5% in the year to August, to 3.75m. </p> <p><strong> Apax</strong><br> The venture capital firm of the moment, Apax boasts former Merrill Lynch investment guru Neil Blackley and ex-Telegraph boss Stephen Grabiner in its ranks. It was in the running to buy the Telegraph group, and joined forces with Haim Saban in a bid to buy ITV last year. </p> <p><strong> Blackpool</strong><br> That unlikeliest of genres - the comic musical with crime drama - with The Deal's David Morrissey starring as an amusement arcade owner striving to make it big in Blackpool. Also starring Sarah Parish, David Tennant and Lucy Gaskell it be gins on BBC1 next month and will be autumn's most talked about drama. </p> <p><strong> Dick &amp; Dom</strong><br> If a bunch of teenagers start yelling \"bogey\" next to you, there is no need to check your nose. They are just playing the Bogey Game from BBC1 Saturday morning show, Dick &amp; Dom in Da Bungalow. Real names Richard McCort and Dominic Wood, Dick &amp; Dom are Ant &amp; Dec with added balls. </p> <p><strong> Didsbury</strong><br> This south Manchester suburb is the district of choice for BBC executives waiting to find out if their departments - Radio 5 and CBBC among them - are moving north. Good restaurants, great schools and a golf course, if it isn't the Kensington of the north then it soon will be with this lot around. </p> <p><strong> Hex</strong><br> An everyday story of a schoolgirl with magic powers, Hex is being touted as the British answer to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Sky One certainly hopes so, as does Elisabeth Murdoch, whose company Shine is co-producing the show. It begins next month. </p> <p><strong> Sailing</strong><br> Yngling, Finn and 470 Class sailing aren't exactly household sports, but Team GB's medal success at the Olympics has made sailing a very marketable sport. So has technology, allowing viewers to get closer to the action than ever. Expect plenty more on Sky Sports. </p> <p><strong> Easy Living</strong><br> From the publishers of Glamour magazine comes Easy Living, a mixture of style, glamour and real-life issues aimed at \"grown-up\" women. Cond\u00e9 Nast promises it will be \"revolutionary\". It launches next March with the help of a \u00a36m marketing spend, and if it gets half of Glamour's 600,000 sales, they will be delighted. </p> <p><strong> Murdoch MacLennan</strong><br> Murdoch MacLennan is the new chief executive of the Telegraph group following its purchase by the Barclay brothers. Top of the former Daily Mail managing director's in-tray will be whether to turn the paper tabloid. </p> <p><strong> Bobby Friction and Nihal</strong><br> The Radio 1 duo were given a primetime slot on Andy Parfitt's station earlier this year. It was due reward for the Sony award-winning pair, whose Asian beats and Flavas show is the antithesis of the network's daytime playlist. </p> <p> <strong> Texas Hold 'Em</strong><br> The online poker business is now worth \u00a315bn. Next year will see the country's first 24-hour celebrity poker show on Challenge TV. Celebrity fans include Radio 1's Colin Murray and The Office's Patrick Baladi. </p> <p><strong> Holy Moly</strong><br> It wasn't the first online gossip board but Holy Moly is the sharpest. Priding itself on dishing the dirt that the newspapers don't (for the most sensible of legal reasons), Holy Moly also features the Priory Pool - celebs most likely to end up in rehab. Popbitch meets Viz. </p> <p><strong> Blinkx</strong><br> Dubbed the internet's \"first intelligent search engine\", Blinkx not only searches the web but also news sites, emails, attachments, blogs and your own hard disk. Unlike Google, it also uses artificial intelligence to rate stories, not page rankings. Only three months old, Blinkx has made quite a splash. </p> <p><strong> Parenting</strong><br> After telling viewers how to decorate (Changing Rooms), garden (Ground Force) and move house (Location, Location, Location), what else is there to learn? How to be a good parent. It's the latest big thing - witness BBC3's Little Angels and Channel 4's Supernanny. Changing Nappies, anyone? </p> <p><strong> The BBC's marketing job</strong><br> The only seat still vacant following the game of media musical chairs sparked by Greg Dyke's exit, Andy Duncan's successor is still to be announced. Following in the footsteps of the man who marketed Freeview will be no easy task. </p> <p><strong> Freesat</strong><br> Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so Greg Dyke, the man who masterminded Freeview, will be delighted that Sky is following his lead by offering a no-subscription digital service. Freesat launches next month with 200 channels for a one-off \u00a3150 fee. </p> <p><strong> I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here!</strong><br> The ITV reality show returns in November, with C-list celebrities reported to include Sid Owen, Chesney Hawkes, Emma B and - surely not - the Duchess of York. After a miserable summer, ITV will be hoping to match the 16 million viewers who watched the last final. </p> <p><strong> The new Honda ad</strong><br> Remember the award-winning \"cog\" advert for Honda, with the car parts arranged in a Heath Robinson style chain reaction? The eagerly-awaited sequel from Wieden &amp; Kennedy London hits the small screen next month (OCT). But instead of car parts, expect cartoon rainbows, cute bunny rabbits, flying diesel engines and a folk song by Garrison Keillor. Bizarre. </p> <p><strong> 'Value'</strong><br> Forget about \"breadth and depth\", the BBC's watchword in the run-up to charter renewal is \"value\". Launching their manifesto Building Public Value, director general Mark Thompson and chairman Michael Grade managed 35 \"values\". They won't be the last. </p> <p><strong> Arrested Development</strong><br> Former Happy Days stars Ron Howard and Henry Winkler reunite in Arrested Development, the tale of a pampered Californian family who fall from grace. Shot spoof documentary-style, the Fox sitcom won three Emmys. It begins on BBC2 on Wednesday.</p>",
  "<p>To: all producers, Coronation Street <br>Fr: Granada <br>Re: Exit strategies (Mike Baldwin, Johnny Briggs) </p> <p>Dear everybody, <br> Thanks for all the suggestions so far! Some were intriguing, some baffling, some brilliant. Keep them coming, and please add your comments to the five \"strategies\" outlined below. </p> <p><strong> 1. Avalanche.</strong> I asked Ursula to check, and she says the last avalanche in England happened in Sussex in 1836, so either it's a preposterous idea, or one could argue (and I'm inclined to go this way) that Weatherfield is well overdue for one. How much would it cost? Who else would die? </p> <p><strong> 2. Celebrity killer.</strong> This offers a big ratings punch. Think about it: Baldwin has an argument in the Rovers, issues threats, storms out. It's snowing outside (not as hard as in idea 1), it's dark, he steps off the kerb and BAM! He's knocked over by a 4X4. The viewers think that's it, but then we pan up over the bonnet to see that THE CAR IS BEING DRIVEN BY JAY KAY FROM JAMIROQUAI! Or Dennis Wise or, ideally, Barbra Streisand. </p> <p><strong> 3. Transexual Baldwin.</strong> We need to start this one soon, so Baldwin has time to admit his feelings and start taking the hormones. Over two years he gradually becomes more feminine and begins living openly as Michela, leading up to the big Christmas Eve operation. When he comes round on Boxing Day, he's played by Barbara Windsor. We've checked to make sure Johnny is fine with all this, and he isn't. </p> <p><strong> 4. Invisible Baldwin.</strong> It seems unlikely that Mike Baldwin would suddenly develop the power of invisibility, but scientists are making progress in this area and by 2006 it probably won't seem quite so outlandish. An explosive row with Sally (they're having an affair, although she doesn't know it's him) winds up with him being accidentally locked in the butcher's freezer, and his form begins to emerge as a light frost coats his invisible corpse. The big advantage is that we don't need Johnny for the last six weeks of shooting. </p> <p><strong> 5. Drowned in a hail of pants. </strong> A personal favourite, but there are technical issues. The amount of ladies' pants required to suffocate a person is unfeasibly large. They just don't weigh enough. I'm told it would work if all the pants were wet, so we need a plausible reason for the sprinklers to go off. Thoughts?</p>",
  "<p>The notion that the more mature have their sets permanently tuned to a daytime TV diet of Trisha, Bargain Hunt and the afternoon movie is as misguided as David Dickinson's perma-tan. </p> <p>Not only do the over-50s class themselves as \"young\", they profess themselves as up for a spot of online dating and not remotely averse to pop music. Media agency OMD UK's research demolishes plenty of myths about the group formerly known as the blue-rinse brigade. </p> <p>Firstly, they have the technology: more than half have multichannel TV access - 43% have satellite or cable TV and 10% have Freeview. </p> <p>And second, they're mad as hell with the people in TV-land. The age group often overlooked by consumer product marketers and therefore market researchers is also being neglected by TV executives, it seems. A quarter of over-50s don't think that people their age are represented enough in TV programmes and more than a quarter believe that there aren't enough programmes for people like them. </p> <p>But when they do stop surfing the internet for potential hot dates and foreign holidays for long enough to switch on the box, it is drama, news and documentaries that get their remote control vote. The TV genres they detest are, sorry David, daytime TV, reality shows and cartoons. </p> <p>But they do have better things to do than stay glued to the box - fewer than one in five said they wouldn't know how to pass the time without the television. </p> <p>And if programme-makers, schedulers, casting directors and TV bosses don't take note, they might find ratings fall as an army of dissatisfied older viewers switch off and go and do something less boring instead. Like kite-surfing.</p>",
  "<p>If you've ever secretly harboured thoughts that a colleague - or even your boss - behaves like a psychopath, you may be closer to the truth than you dared to imagine. A study has found that there are far more sub-criminal psychopaths - self-serving, narcissistic schemers who display a stunning lack of empathy, but are not criminally inclined - at large in the population than had previously been thought. Some even end up in managerial positions. </p> <p>\"The world of unfeeling psychopaths is not limited to the popular images of monsters who steal people's children or kill without remorse,\" explains Robert Hare, a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia in Canada, who conducted the study. \"After all, if you are bright, you have been brought up with good social skills, and you don't want to end up in prison, so you probably won't turn to a life of violence. Rather, you'll recognise that you can use your psychopathic tendencies more legitimately by getting into positions of power and control. What better place than a corporation?\" </p> <p>\"Corporate psychopaths\" tend to be manipulative, arrogant, callous, impatient, impulsive, unreliable and prone to fly into rages, according to Professor Hare. They break promises, and take credit for the work of others and blame everyone else when things go wrong. \"Psychopaths are social predators and like all predators they are looking for feeding grounds,\" he says. \"Wherever you get power, prestige and money, you will find them.\" </p> <p>But with today's employers increasingly focusing on anti-bullying policies, how do they get away with it? Paul Babiak, an organisational psychologist, explains that psychopaths have the ability to demonstrate the traits that the organisation wants and needs, as well as coming across as smooth, polished and engaging. They can appear to employers to be the perfect manager. \"The psychopath is the kind of individual that can give you the right impression, has a charming facade, can look and sound like the ideal leader, but behind this mask has a dark side,\" he says. \"It's this dark side of the personality that lies, is deceitful, is manipulative and that bullies other people.\" </p> <p>Dr Babiak claims to have dealt with corporate psychopaths who not only demonstrate the defining characteristics of lack of remorse and empathy, but also enjoy causing others pain. \"I have seen individuals fire people and take great pleasure in doing it,\" he says. </p> <p>Frances Collins was driven out of her job after just a few months, whilst her psychopathic boss remained in his. \"One shining example of his lack of empathy was the day of my graduation,\" she says. \"There was an event happening at work that day, which I had worked extremely hard to help them prepare for. It was all set to go like clockwork, so I was able to take the day off. On the same day, I found out that my stepdad had cancer, so wound up having to comfort my mother, as well as deal with my graduation. When I returned to work, and my boss discovered this, he simply pulled me up on the fact that I hadn't rang to check if the event had gone OK.\" </p> <p>He would turn up to work at 10am and leave by 4pm almost every day, \"due to family issues,\" she says. \"Yet it was almost as if no one else had a family or life, for that matter. Then, when people complained that the communications team was never there, he tried to imply that it was myself or the other PR officer at fault when we were out covering his meetings.\" </p> <p>In some organisations, corporate psychopaths pose a threat not only to individuals, but also to the entire workforce, according to Dr Babiak. They build up a power base and turn everyone in the organisation paranoid, everyone becomes afraid of everyone else and the work culture begins to reflect the personality of the leader. </p> <p>Dr Babiak adds that bullying isn't the only characteristic displayed by the corporate psychopath. \"Many even promote fraud in the organisation and steal the company's money,\" he says. Recent research by accountants MacIntyre Hudson demonstrates just how much of a concern to companies this is. Almost four out of 10 business owners in Britain view the possibility of fraud - particularly being ripped off by one of their own employees - as the single biggest threat to their company, the study found. </p> <p>In an attempt to root out such undesirable employees, Dr Babiak and Prof Hare have teamed up to design a test aimed at enabling companies to detect corporate psychopaths before they can do serious damage in the workplace. The \"Business Scan 360\" test will assess managers who come across as ideal corporate leaders, but who may carry psychopathic traits. Colleagues and a supervisor of the person being tested will be asked to fill in a detailed questionnaire that considers four aspects of the subject's personality - anti-social tendencies, organisational maturity, interpersonal relations, and personal style. </p> <p>But the idea is not to smoke out these people and give them the boot, insists Prof Hare. \"Some organisations would value some of the traits, such as being remorseless and manipulative. Used-car salesmen, for example, will probably need to be cut-throat,\" he says. \"The major problem is that psychopaths get into organisations as they interview well and can convince people that they are right for the job. But as soon as the person is hired all sorts of problems start.\" </p> <p>Tim Field, author of Bully in Sight and a recognised expert on bullying in Britain, believes the test is good news for victims of corporate psychopaths. \"'At the moment, there is very little that they can do to regain control of their career other than leave their job altogether,\" he says. </p> <p>\"You cannot negotiate or mediate with this kind of bully for two reasons. First, because they have a different kind of mindset to everyone else and second, because they are very good at pulling the wool over their employers' eyes. In fact, if you try to negotiate or mediate, they will simply see you as vulnerable, which can put you in even more danger. They get their kicks out of causing other people pain, so a vulnerable person is a prime target.\" </p> <p>Mr Field's own research has identified four types of \"serial bully\" in the workplace, and the one he claims is most dangerous is what he calls the \"sociopath\". \"The sociopath - which is short for 'socialised psychopath' - is basically my term for the corporate psychopath,\" he says. \"I just chose to emphasise the 'socialised' aspect because these people have brought their behaviour to just within what is socially and legally acceptable.\" </p> <p>Sociopaths, he says, tend to sit at middle, or just above, middle management and while Professor Hare has found they often gravitate towards roles in business, the media, law and politics - where scheming and bullying is just part of everyday working life - Mr Field has spotted them in others sectors too. \"I get a lot of calls from victims in the caring professions - nursing, social services and education, for example. I believe that's because they prey on vulnerable people and vulnerable people often choose to work in this sector.\" </p> <p>Corporate psychologist Ben Williams agrees that the corporate psychopath is at large in management throughout Britain. \"But I would argue that there are fewer than in the past because we now have laws against discrimination and unfair behaviour,\" he says. </p> <p>Others disagree. The quickly changing corporate world is increasingly susceptible to the psycho in a suit, Dr Babiak believes. The old, staid, bureaucratic organisation filled with rules, policies and procedures was too frustrating and unattractive to the psychopath, he says. \"Now, because the pace of business has accelerated so much, only organisations that move fast can survive. It also makes it more fun to work there, not just for you and I, but for the psychopath as well.\" </p> <p>Not all corporate psychopaths get away with their antics, however. Alan Ross recalls working for a particularly mercenary one in an investment bank. \"I was just out of university and she almost screwed me up completely,\" he says. \"She had ambitions to move into a new area of work and did this primarily by getting her researchers - us - to translate and plagiarise equity research from all the continental banks and sell it as her own research. This proved highly successful and she was getting a name for herself as an expert.\" </p> <p>Just before she was offered a major job in her new \"expert\" role, however, Ross decided to put an end to her reign of terror. \"First we supplied a dossier to a magazine, which duly printed an expos\u00e9 of her. Finally, to rub it right in, we sent copies of the article to every fund manager she ever had dealings with - ie all the bank's best and wealthiest customers. Job done - she was suspended pending an investigation and then sacked.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Some names have been changed.</p>",
  "<p>Have you ever wondered whether Batman is better than Superman, where is the nearest Nando's to Soho, or how much a vector boson weighs? Some people have, apparently. All these questions have been fielded by Any Questions Answered (AQA) one of the new text services which knows that there is a Nando's in Frith Street and that there are two types of vector bosons, the W particle and the Z particle. AQA is one of several services which, for around \u00a31 a go, allow you to text a question via mobile, and get an answer back, sometimes within a few minutes. Not all texts are sent in to the service just for the fun of it, according to research from 82ASK, another text information service. Its findings are that 68% of users have asked questions for business purposes. </p> <p>Brokers use such services from taxis to keep track of financial statistics, secretaries use them to double-check curtain up or kick-off for corporate hospitality events, or to get train times and flight times, without having to be kept on hold on a regular inquiry line. And a lot of people admit to using these services for showing off to colleagues by creating the impression that the weight of a vector boson is instantly summoned up from their giant brains. The services are aiming to cash in on the deregulation of directory enquiries, especially as they will handle vague questions such as what is the number of my nearest cinema? How do they work? The questions are answered by humans, backed up of course by databases, and no doubt, Google. As well as providing an answer they will usually give some indication of how they arrived at it. </p> <p>For example, according to AQA, Superman is considered superior to Batman on the rather spurious grounds that Superman has notched up more movies. It probably is not worth the expense of arguing, but the operators will text service users for clarification if they do not understand the original question. There is certainly no limit to the scope of these services' ambition. Asked what is the meaning of life AQA replies: \"In The Meaning of Life, written by Bradley Grieve, the answer is summarised thus: 'Figure out what you love and do it'.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> AQA 63336; 82ASK 82275</p>"
