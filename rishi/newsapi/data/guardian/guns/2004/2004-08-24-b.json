  "An official report on the Abu Ghraib abuse scandal yesterday blamed a failure of leadership at the Pentagon for negligence over prison conditions and confusion over interrogation rules which led to \"Animal House\" sadism in the Iraqi jail. <p>The report, by a four-member panel of Pentagon advisers, did not pin direct responsibility on the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, by name, nor did it find any top officials legally culpable. The worst abuse at Abu Ghraib, it said, was carried out by night shift guards. </p> <p>But the report represented an implicit indictment of the defence secretary's management of the defence department. </p> <p>\"We believe there is institutional and personal responsibility right up the chain of command as far as Washington is concerned,\" James Schlesinger, a former defence secretary who chaired the panel, told reporters yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Rumsfeld issued a non-committal response last night. \"The panel has provided important information and recommendations that will be of assistance in our ongoing efforts to improve detention operations,\" he said in a statement. </p> <p>\"The defence department has an obligation to evaluate what happened and to make appropriate changes. The independent panel's contributions will be of great help to us.\" </p> <p>For the first time since the Abu Ghraib scandal broke in March, the Schlesinger report officially made a connection between the actions or omissions of the Bush administration and the brutal treatment of prisoners in US military prisons, and could deepen the damage already done by the affair to the president's re-election effort. </p> <p>\"I think this is going to be more of a problem than they anticipated when they appointed this panel,\" said Professor Scott Silliman, an expert on military law at Duke University in North Carolina. </p> <p>The Schlesinger report depicts the torture scandal as one of the unseen circumstances of poor planning by the Pentagon leadership. </p> <p>\"In Iraq, there was not only a failure to plan for a major insurgency, but also to adapt to the insurgency that followed after major combat operations,\" the report found, adding that the war plan assumed a period of \"relatively benign stability\" would precede a transfer of power to the new Iraqi authorities. </p> <p>More damning details of the use of torture against Iraqi prisoners are expected to surface today, with the results of a separate army investigation into the role of military intelligence at Abu Ghraib. </p> <p>Leaks from that report, published in the Washington Post yesterday, included a finding that some guards used dogs to terrify prisoners as young as 15, in a sadistic game aimed at making their victims wet themselves in fear. The report will also mention evidence that at least one Iraqi male detainee was raped. </p> <p>Mr Schlesinger said yesterday that \"chaos\" reigned at Abu Ghraib.He said there was \"sadism on the nightshift\" and added, \"It was a kind of Animal House on the night shift ,\" in a reference to the 1978 film which portrays the unsavoury antics of a bunch of hedonistic students. </p> <p>\"There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military authorities,\" the Schlesinger report found. But Mr Schlesinger said yesterday: \"There was indirect responsibility at higher levels, in that the weaknesses at Abu Ghraib were well known and corrective action could have been taken, and should have been taken.\" </p> <p>The Schlesinger report said \"confusing and inconsistent interrogation technique policies\" issued by the Pentagon and the White House contributed to the belief among officers and soldiers at Abu Ghraib that they could use methods that had been allowed at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, but banned for use in Iraq. </p> <p>The panel also found fault with America's top generals in the joint chiefs of staff, for failing to make sufficient manpower and resources available at Abu Ghraib prison and the rest of a huge network of military jails that has sprung up around the world. </p> <p>The former US force commander in Iraq, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, was blamed in the report. But he, too, escaped legal responsibility, and the panel did not recommend a reprimand. </p> <p>Until today, only seven military police guards have been charged for the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib, and human rights groups said the Schlesinger report was a whitewash of the Bush administration's responsibility. </p> <p>Administration critics say US leaders created the conditions for the abuse by insisting suspected terrorists did not merit treatment under Geneva convention rules. </p> <p>Today's army report into the role of military intelligence, by Major General George Fay, is expected to recommend proceedings against soldiers who are not already among the seven facing trial, and against civilian contractors who worked at Abu Ghraib.</p>",
  "<p>Liverpool have rejected the latest bid from Steve Morgan to inject significant capital into the club, a scheme that would have effectively seen the building tycoon take control.</p> <p>The club's hierarchy had accepted proposals for a \u00a370m share purchase from Morgan after more than a month of negotiations. Yet he revised that offer after checks during the process of due diligence suggested the cost of the proposed new stadium in Stanley Park had risen significantly. </p> <p>He then submitted a \u00a370m package that would have placed around \u00a350m directly at the club's disposal. But agreement could not be reached as to how the \u00a370m would be split between the club and shareholders.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> To Newcastle, first, and a story that just cries out to be fed through the Diary's random Littlejohn generator. Sadly, that contraption is still not operational (we're having some trouble finding enough dead gay asylum seekers to fuel it) - but we'll take a wild punt that Richard would conclude you couldn't make the following up. And so: the Newcastle Evening Chronicle reports that the Liberal Democrats, who took control of the city council in June, have voted to honour their manifesto pledge to cut \u00a3100,000 off the annual \u00a3940,000 budget for senior councillors' allowances. Unfortunately - and here we see the good folk of local government foiled once again - an independent remuneration panel has vetoed the plan, and forbidden the councillors to slash their own pay. The astonished Lib Dems are now examining alternative ways of saving the money, including returning part of their salaries on an informal basis. \"If necessary,\" council leader Peter Arnold tells the paper, \"I'll hand back the money.\" We wish him all the best. <p><b>\u00b7</b> We're most grateful to the CBI, meanwhile, for their press release lamenting standards of literacy and numeracy in school leavers. Acquiring such basic business skills, advises Digby Jones, is \"the 'hear and now' for teenage Britain\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Good heavens. After all this time of being strangers, we've finally made contact with Harry Cummins, the British Council press officer who moonlights as Will Cummins, star Sunday Telegraph columnist and author of such clever rants as \"Muslims are a threat to us all\". Harry is still on paid suspension while the BC investigate his denials - but meanwhile we'll be amazed if our conversation with him doesn't become a set text in interview technique for would-be journalists the world over. Lovely to talk at last, we greet him as he answers the phone. How's tricks? \"Fine,\" says Harry. Good. Now, how long are you planning to spin this one out before you cough to it? \"All this is being investigated by my employers.\" Click, brrr. And thence straight to answerphone. We've provisionally selected something in peach for the Pulitzer party, but any designers wanting to loan us stuff should get their offers in early. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Surveillance 1: Jack Straw, on Radio 4, repeatedly referring to \"the Sudan\". It's bad enough tagging along to war behind a rabid imperialist, Jack, but beyond vulgar to start talking like one as well. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Delicious news from Virginia, where the charming Reverend Jerry Falwell is to open a Christian-led law school. Students will be trained to fight causes such as gay rights and abortion, and the course at Jerry's Liberty University has already attracted 61 applicants. The school's website promises lessons will combine \"history, objective reality, morality and common sense\" - and who could quibble, given that Jerry's previous triumphs include identifying one of the Teletubbies as gay and blaming the 9/11 attacks on gays and feminists. Anyway, something to stick on the Ucas form if you're not tempted by David Beckham's LA soccer academy or Madonna's planned Kabbalah college. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Incidentally, does anyone know anyone who actually practises Kabbalah, the celebrity religion du jour, who could get us a free place on the London centre's 10-week introductory course? Apparently it makes sense of literally all human existence - even why you have to spend \u00a3400 on a starter pack of books - and we're keen to take the Diary's black soul a couple of shades lighter this year.

  "The government and the House of Commons may just be edging towards a discovery about our dismal relations with the European Union. If the role of British ministers in making every key EU decision is hidden from the British people by a secretive and ineffective Commons scrutiny system, then it is not surprising that the British feel that the EU is disconnected and bureaucratic. Brussels is \"them\" who do things to \"us\". EU law is often presented as alien even by the ministers who agreed it. <p>The result of such unwholesome practices is that British public opinion is the most Eurosceptic in the EU. Fewer of us think that there are benefits to our membership than other Europeans. More of us think that the EU is undemocratic. More of us want to withdraw than in any other member state. Ukip's rise has given us the largest party committed to exit in any of the 25 member states.</p> <p>The reasons for this festering hostility to the EU lie mainly in Britain, not Brussels. Certainly, the EU does stupid things. But most of the 450 million European citizens are wise enough to know that a set of institutions that delivers peace, prosperity and the power to tackle cross-border problems such as pollution is not going to be perfect. The calculus, comparing the past 50 years with any previous 50 years of European history, is overwhelmingly positive. </p> <p>The real problem is that successive British governments have failed to make it clear that no major EU decision is taken without British ministers participating, and generally agreeing. The most sensitive issues - such as tax - require unanimity. Even when issues are agreed by majority, Britain is outvoted less often than any other major member state. We win from majority voting. </p> <p>But would we know it? British MPs often react like scalded cats when they discover that some EU directive has been agreed by ministers and MEPs, and is all over bar the shouting. Once a minister has signed off a directive in Brussels, and it is approved by the European parliament, the UK is committed to implementing its objectives, usually by means of a statutory instrument which requires no Commons debate. We are then even more surprised when Whitehall implements the directive adding items from its own agenda: so-called \"gold-plating\". </p> <p>The reason for our ignorance is the woeful inadequacy of the Commons' scrutiny of EU matters. Despite dealing with some 12 directives since 1999, there was not a single occasion on which the scrutiny committee either called me to give evidence or sent me its views. The Commons scrutiny committee meets in secret with a procedure that essentially involves sifting the paperwork that spews from the EU commission. Not surprisingly, it is swamped. </p> <p> Nor is this record compensated by greater activity on the backbenches. In a recent survey of written parliamentary questions, my colleague Chris Davies MEP found that a mere 79 questions out of 40,000 put down during one session concerned British ministers' attitudes in the council of ministers. There were 92 council meetings, each attended by a British minister, during that time. </p> <p>This failure to hold ministers to account has an unintended consequence. Because ministers know that there is no political downside in agreeing EU directives and regulations, they often delegate negotiations to British officials. A Brussels bureaucracy is met by a British one. Issues that should properly be political - because they involve values, and have political consequences - are never lifted to a political level except in the European parliament, where MEPs do not have the same profile as ministers. </p> <p>The Nordic countries have shown there is a much better way. Another Eurosceptic country, Denmark, pioneered the idea of examining Danish ministers before they went to each council meeting. Ministers are even given a rigid negotiating mandate. Danish scrutiny is high profile, public and unrelenting. As a result, the Danish Folketing - and the Danes - are forewarned and forearmed. </p> <p>The Danish system has its faults. Danish ministers can be so tied down that other ministers do not find it worthwhile negotiating with them, as they know they have no flexibility beyond their public position. The best model is the Finnish Eduskunta. Its grand committee of senior parliamentarians takes evidence before each ministerial meeting. It allows ministers to interpret a mandate flexibly. </p> <p>It can also, crucially, call for specialist evidence from its select committees. One of the great myths of Brussels is that you need to be a Brussels specialist to understand it. In fact, the core expertise in scrutinising a law on abattoirs is an understanding of abattoirs, not of Brussels procedures. And such expertise is more likely in a select committee than the foreign affairs committee. EU law is domestic, not a branch of foreign policy. </p> <p>Will it happen here? Peter Hain, the leader of the House of Commons, shows some signs of rising to the challenge. He - and perhaps the modernisation committee that he chairs - is beginning to realise the connection between the lack of Commons scrutiny and Euroscepticism. He has proposed a grand committee, meeting in public. So far, so good. The problem is that he has proposed that it meet just twice or four times a year. </p> <p>By contrast, the Nordic grand committees meet almost weekly, so that they can take evidence from ministers before every EU council. That is the guarantee that they are well-informed, and examine the issues before decisions are taken rather than succumb to shock afterwards. If the modernisation committee is to do more than genuflect to the need for EU scrutiny, it needs to face the far greater time commitment required of some MPs. Let us hope that it does, for our EU membership may depend on it. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Chris Huhne, a Liberal Democrat MEP, recently gave evidence on EU scrutiny to the Commons modernisation committee.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:chuhne@europarl.eu.int\">chuhne@europarl.eu.int</a></p>",
  "Mahdi army fighters loyal to the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr had largely abandoned Najaf's Imam Ali shrine yesterday before American forces launched a massive offensive, which was under way last night. <p>Sources inside the resistance movement said the majority of the militiamen slipped out of the complex after a secret order by Mr Sadr five days ago. </p> <p>The cleric was no longer in the area immediately around the shrine, which was encircled by American tanks, they said. </p> <p>\"He is 100% not there,\" one source said. \"We are cleverer than the Americans think. Anybody who stays behind is likely to be killed.\" He added: \"We need these people.\" </p> <p>Mr Sadr's aides insisted the cleric was still in Najaf, but many of his fighters appeared to be regrouping in the neighbouring town of Kufa, having been told that the battle for the shrine has effectively been lost. </p> <p>Their withdrawal preceded a ferocious bombardment by US forces of both Najaf and Kufa last night - and the largely symbolic arrival of a handful of Iraqi government troops near, but not in, the battle zone for the first time. </p> <p>American tanks were only a few hundred metres from the shrine, and had blocked off a strategic boulevard immediately to the south. </p> <p>A major American military operation appeared to be underway last night after a day of intense fighting. </p> <p>The streets of Najaf's old city echoed to the \"pop pop\" of machine gunfire. Overhead US warplanes circled continuously. Two Apache helicopter gunships flew over the vast cemetery. </p> <p>They also attacked targets in Kufa, where the crump of tank shells could be heard. Seconds later thick black smoke billowed above the old city. </p> <p>Yesterday Iraq's defence minister, Hazim al-Shalan, predicted that the battle in Najaf, which has severely dented the authority of the US-backed interim government, was entering its final, and possibly most bloody, stage. </p> <p>\"We are in the last hours,\" he told a news conference at a US base outside the city. \"This evening Iraqi forces will reach the doors of the shrine and control it, and appeal to the Mahdi army to throw down their weapons. If they do not, we will wipe them out.\" </p> <p>But Mr Shalan has made the same claim before, and last week Iraq's interior ministry announced prematurely that police were already inside the shrine. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Baghdad yesterday insurgents tried to assassinate Iraq's environment and education ministers in separate bombings that killed five of their bodyguards and wounded more than a dozen people, officials said. </p> <p>The environment minister, Mishkat Moumin, said she had survived a suicide car bomb attack on her convoy. \"I have been working on sending aid to Najaf and before that distributing water in Sadr City. Serving the Iraqi people is not a crime that deserves this,\" Ms Moumin told Reuters. </p> <p>The education minister, Sami al-Mudhaffar, was unhurt after a roadside bomb hit his convoy. </p> <p>The attacks were the latest attempts to kill government officials, seen as traitors by Iraq's resistance. The uprising in Najaf has plunged the prime minister, Ayad Allawi, into his gravest crisis so far. </p> <p>Yesterday a spokesman for Mr Sadr, Ali Semesin, told journalists the cleric still wanted a peaceful solution. \"We are still ready to negotiate to end this suffering,\" he said. </p> <p>Another of Mr Sadr's aides said shrapnel from an American attack on Monday night had hit the shrine's golden dome, one of its minarets and the compound's outer wall. The US said the Mahdi army caused the damage after firing a rocket that clipped one of the shrine's walls and exploded. </p> <p>Yesterday an official at Najaf's al-Hakim Hospital said at least two fighters had been killed and four wounded. Two civilians also died and two others were injured. More casualties were reported in the old city, where emergency workers could not reach. </p> <p>Mr Sadr has not been seen in public for many days, and police drove around Najaf with loudspeakers yesterday declaring that he had fled towards Sulaimaniya in northern Iraq. His aides denied that. </p> <p>\"Moqtada al-Sadr is still in Najaf and is still supervising the operations,\" Aws al-Khafaji, the head of Mr Sadr's office in the southern city of Nassiriya, told al-Jazeera television. </p> <p>US warplanes reportedly also struck the volatile city of Falluja early yesterday. Witnesses said it was unclear what the target was, but they reported flames and smoke in southern parts of the town.</p>",
  "On The Ridge, 200 metres above the river Lynher, warm humid wind blowing from stony Kilmar and Trewortha tors presages more torrential downpours, another hindrance to harvest. From the tumulus, on this rough-grazed hill burnished with flowering western gorse and shrivelled bracken, a wide view extends eastwards towards pale Dartmoor and north east to faraway Exmoor. In the intervening bosky landscape, the varying greens of permanent pastures and reseeded leys prevail over the browns of arrish, stubble and standing corn. <p>Nearer home much of the harvest is complete. Triticale, widely grown for fodder and without the need for perfect ripeness, is already crimped and stored in clamps under black plastic weighted down with old tyres. Jeff has spread dung on stubble while Horace has already ploughed and reseeded to temporary grass. Spring-sown barley will provide straw for George's lambing shed next year. Remaining stands of winter wheat are beginning to sprout but need dry weather for combining. </p> <p>On August 31, 60 years ago, I was born at the beginning of harvest. My grandmother went in sweltering heat to see mother and baby. She walked up Down Lane and across Viverdon Down. There, my father, grandfather and helpers were frantically harvesting, unable to take her to Pentillie Castle which had been requisitioned as a maternity hospital. In those days there were no sprays to control pests and moulds. In this damp area the dredge corn that was grown was sown in spring. Ripening in September, it was cut and bound in sheaves, dried in stooks and stacked in ricks for threshing in the mowhay.</p>",
  "<p> Yesterday the maker of John Smith's bitter was under further pressure after a ban on beer advertising became law in Russia and a leading investment bank repeated its sell recommendation. </p> <p>S&amp;N is a leading player in Russia's fast growing beer market through Baltic Beverage Holdings, a joint venture with Carlsberg. BBH is reckoned to have a 30% share of the Russian market, which is the second largest in Europe after Germany. As such, any developments in Russia tend to affect the S&amp;N share price, which was also hit yesterday by bearish comments from Citigroup Smith Barney. </p> <p>The US broker believes S&amp;N deserves to trade at a discount to its peers and the market because earnings growth is being driven by cost cutting in the UK, which it says cannot go on for ever. As for the possibility of a bid, it reckons regulators would only let two companies - <strong>SABMiller</strong>, up 4p to 684p, and Anheuser Busch - acquire S&amp;N and neither seem to be interested at the moment. As such Citigroup believes S&amp;N is a sell. The shares closed 7.25p lower at 393.5p. </p> <p>In the drinks sector <strong>Allied Domecq</strong>, the maker of Beefeater gin and Sauza tequila, eased 6.25p to 444p after Deutsche Bank, one of its biggest supporters in the City, trimmed its earnings forecasts ahead of next week's trading update. </p> <p>At the time of its half-year results in April, Allied warned the impact of adverse currency movements for the year would be around \u00a335m. Since then currencies in a number of Allied's principal markets have weakened against sterling. As such the German broker believes the impact could now be as much as \u00a345m and has lowered its forecasts by 1.5% as a result. </p> <p>In the wider market, it was another deathly quiet session in which leading shares went precisely nowhere even though the oil price continued to weaken. The final scores showed the <strong> FTSE 100</strong> up 2.2 points at 4,407.5, with fuel guzzler <strong>British Airways</strong>, up 5.5p to 224.5p, unsurprisingly the best performer. </p> <p>Elsewhere, it was no more interesting. The <strong> FTSE 250</strong> gained 20.1 points to 6,036.7, while the <strong>FTSE Small Cap</strong> in dex added 2.8 points to 2,449.3. In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 99.970, yielding 5.004%. </p> <p>Mining group <strong>Anglo-American</strong> was dog of the day in the FTSE 100, slipping 33p to \u00a312.51 on a combination of profit-taking and news that diamond miners in Botswana had gone on strike. Anglo-American owns 45% of the world famous De Beers, which mines in Botswana. </p> <p>Grocer <strong>Wm Morrison</strong> marked time at 177.25p despite talk that another profits warning could be on the cards before October's interim results. Unusually yesterday's rumour was of a slowdown in trading at the core Morrisons business rather than further troubles at Safeway. </p> <p><strong>Man Group</strong> slipped 8p to \u00a313.37. After the market closed the hedge fund manager announced the value of its AHL fund had fallen 2.43% in the past week. After two weeks in which the value of the fund had risen by 3%, dealers reckon the fact that AHL has failed to hold those gains could spark selling this morning. </p> <p>Lower down the market, there was another poor performance from glass maker <strong>Pilkington</strong>. Since the start of the month its shares have fallen nearly 10%. Analysts blame the weakness on the rising fuel costs, in particular the price of natural gas in the US, one of Pilkington's biggest markets. Pilkington fell a further 2p to 87.25p yesterday. </p> <p>On a brighter note, <strong>Cookson</strong>, the electronics and precious metals group, advanced 2.25p to 33.5p after Investec Securities withdrew its reduce rating on the stock. The broker reckons Cookson has gone from being the most expensive stock in the engineering sector to one of the cheapest in the past four months. </p> <p>Among the small caps Terry Ramsden, the former Japanese warrants trader turned stake builder, was the main talking point. </p> <p>In the past few days the three companies in which Mr Ramsden has, or plans to take, significant equity stakes - <strong>Hansard</strong>, <strong>Caplay</strong> and <strong>Tradingsports Exchange Systems</strong> - have all taken a good beating. And there was further bad news after the market closed last night when Hansard, a financial PR firm run by Adam Reynolds, a former stockbroker, said a proposed \u00a310.65m fund raising had hit problems. </p> <p>It seems three investors who signed up to take stock in the placing have failed to pay, leaving Hansard some \u00a33.85m short. As a result the company is having to look for new investors and has postponed the listing until Friday. </p> <p>Paul Foulger, Hansard's finance director, said he was reasonably confident that it would be able to find other investors. </p> <p>None the less, Hansard, which closed 2.5p lower at 41.5p, is likely to come under further pressure today. The shares were 116p at the start of the month. </p> <p><strong>Caplay</strong>, down 0.25p at 9.875p yesterday, however, may rally. After hours, Mr Ramsden announced he had acquired a further 2.5m shares, taking his holding to 14.3%. </p> <p><strong>Alphameric</strong>, the supplier of retail software, gained 3.75p to 76.5p on rumours of a back office contract win with a leading retailer. </p> <p>Department store operator <strong>House of Fraser</strong> marked time at 115p despite suggestions from Nick Bubb, the retail analyst at Evolution Beeson Gregory, that 11% shareholder Tom Hunter may be looking to offload his stake.</p>",

  "Polio, which can paralyse small children, has become the latest threat to refugees already struggling with famine and disease in the camps of Darfur. <p>Sudan is one of 12 countries that had been polio-free for at least two years but are now again seeing cases of paralysis as a direct result of a major outbreak in northern Nigeria. </p> <p>There have been 453 cases of polio in Kano, Nigeria, because controversy over the polio vaccine in the Muslim province led to cessation of immunisation. Although immunisation in Kano started again two weeks ago, major efforts will be needed across much of Africa to contain the outbreak. </p> <p>One case was identified in Darfur earlier in the year. Yesterday it was confirmed there have been three more, all caused by the Nigerian polio strain. </p> <p>Two more countries that were free of polio have had cases, it was revealed yesterday, taking the total from ten in June to 12 now - Mali and Guinea are outside the ring of African states around Nigeria and Niger where mass immunisation took place in February and March in an effort to check the spread. </p> <p>African Union health ministers have agreed a campaign to reach 74 million children under five years old, but it will be able to go ahead only if more money is forthcoming from donors. </p> <p>Six countries have never been polio-free.

  "Six weeks after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre, President George Bush flew to New York to throw out the ceremonial first pitch in the World Series baseball game between the New York Yankees and the Arizona Diamondbacks. <p>The president was finding it difficult to throw the ball in his bulletproof vest. \"Are you going to throw from the rubber or the base of the mound?\" asked Yankee star Derek Jeter. The rubber, the highest point on the mound, is the point from which a pitcher would usually throw. Bush had been planning to throw from the base, which is about six to 10 feet closer to the home plate. \"If you throw from the base of the mound they are going to boo you. You really need to take the rubber,\" said Jeter. </p> <p>Bush, then at the height of his popularity and leading a nation at war with Afghanistan and in fear of an anthrax attack, asked Jeter if the fans would really be so mean. \"Yeah,\" said Jeter. \"It's New York.\" </p> <p>Three years later, Bush is coming back to New York to a sceptical, if not downright hostile public as the Republicans prepare to kick off their convention on Monday. In an ad broadcast in June to prepare New Yorkers, former Democratic mayor Ed Koch pleaded: \"While they're here, make nice. Volunteer to show 'em the ropes. They won't know uptown from downtown. They've never ordered pizza by the slice.\" </p> <p>But with a week to go, the best they can hope for is that this city, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by five to one, doesn't \"make too nasty\". It may be in vain. So numerous are the expected protesters at the presence of the \"Grand Old Party\" in the city that its Republican mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has spoken of them as a marketing opportunity. Last week he offered discounts to Broadway shows, museums, stores and restaurants to those wearing buttons bearing a picture of the Statue of Liberty and the words \"peaceful political activists\". </p> <p>\"It's no fun to protest on an empty stomach, so you might want to try a restaurant,\" said Bloomberg. \"Or you might want to go shopping, maybe for another pair of sneakers for the march.\" </p> <p>The protesters, meanwhile, are making their own plans.

The Republicans are coming!\", mimicking the 18th-century Massachusetts craftsman Paul Revere who rode a horse through that state warning locals that the British were coming during the American War of Independence. A group of bell ringers, meanwhile, are planning to surround the site of Ground Zero ringing 2,749 bells to commemorate the victims of September 11 and oppose the war.</p> <p>\"Visitors to the city at the end of August may see illegal murals with political messages and the city itself may become a giant art installation,\" warns Liza Featherstone in the leftwing Nation magazine. \"Don't be surprised if you're crossing the street and a traffic light flashes 'Beat Bush' instead of 'Don't walk'. \" </p> <p>But not all the demonstrations will be unorthodox attention-grabbers. Among the more traditional acts of protest will be a parade of thousands of abortion-rights advocates marching across Brooklyn Bridge; the Hip-Hop summit's poor people's march to Madison Square Garden, where the convention is being held; the 5,000-strong permitless march of the poor being organised by a welfare mother from Philadelphia; and the huge demonstration planned for Sunday, which the demonstrators insist will be in Central Park and the New York Police are adamant will be on the West side highway, but which could reach a million-strong. </p> <p>Reverend Earl Kooperkamp of St Mary's Episcopal Church in Harlem will be hosting between 30 and 50 protesters on the wooden pews of his church, and has persuaded more than 30 other religious institutions to do the same, offering housing to almost 500 people. \"As long as they're standing firm against war, working for peace, that's what the church is supposed to be about,\" he told the New York Times. \"We pray every day to a guy called the Prince of Peace.\" </p> <p>Peace may not be on everyone's mind, however. At least 20,000 security personnel, representing everyone from the Secret Service to civilian units of the Army National Guard, have been mustered. Given that the convention is expected to attract only 48,000 visitors, including delegates, lobbyists and journalists, this is the equivalent to one law-enforcement official for every 2.4 civilians. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been questioning dozens of protesters who plan to come to New York, asking them all three basic questions: were they planning to be violent, did they know anyone else who was planning violent acts and did they understand that it is a crime, to withhold any information if they might know. The questioning immediately raised concerns about civil liberties, particularly after three young men, who were planning to come to New York from Missouri, were subpoenaed earlier this month and informed that they are part of a domestic terrorism investigation, without being informed on what grounds.</p> <p>\"It is part of a national effort to chill dissent in this country,\" says Bill Dobbs, the spokesman for United for Peace and Justice, which is staging week-long demonstrations in New York during the convention. \"And it is always a worry that this kind of intimidation will scare people off.\"</p> <p>\"The FBI isn't in the business of chilling anyone's first amendment rights,\" says Joe Parris, an FBI spokesman, referring to the right to free speech and free assembly enshrined in the United States constitution. \"But criminal behaviour isn't covered by the first amendment.\"</p> <p>The fact that the focus has shifted from what will be said inside the convention to what might happen outside is a symbol of just how much has changed in the national political mood over the past 18 months. Back in January 2003, when the party declared its choice of New York (over New Orleans and Tampa), it seemed like a shrewd if cynical move.</p> <p>The logic behind both the venue and the timing (the latest of any convention) was to bolster George Bush's status as a war leader, standing firm against terrorist attacks. \"What we focused on was that New York was the best background for the convention, growing out of the events of September 11,\" says Roland Betts, a member of the committee of Republicans assembled by Bloomberg to lobby the White House to come to New York. As recently as July last year, former mayor Rudolph Giuliani was claiming that Bush could even be the first Republican to take the state since Ronald Reagan in 1984. \"New Yorkers like strong leaders,\" he explained at the time.</p> <p>But that was then. In January 2003, when the announcement was made, the nation was facing down the United Nations and preparing for war with Iraq. President Bush had 59% approval ratings, 68% of Americans supported military force against Saddam Hussein and the Democrats were amassing a crowded field of contenders with no obvious frontrunner. Today, Bush's approval ratings stand at 49%, 47% of Americans think going to war was a mistake and his Democratic challenger, John Kerry, leads in 13 of the 17 key swing states, if only by a narrow margin in most of them. With the latest poll giving Bush 35% in New York against Kerry's 53% he has about as much chance of taking New York as Saddam Hussein does of taking back Baghdad.</p> <p>Opposition to the war was not insignificant at the time, but it had been marginalised. But the torture scandal in Abu Ghraib, President Bush's premature declaration of victory in Iraq, a stiffer than expected Iraqi resistance, a lack of international support and US military casualties that could reach 1,000 during the convention, have put the war into mainstream political debate. Meanwhile, the findings of the 9/11 commission into the terrorist attacks, the publication of which has become a bestseller, have exposed institutional shortcomings that put a question mark even over what he hoped would be seen as his finest hour.</p> <p>In May last year, the leaseholder of the World Trade Centre, Larry Silverstein, told the Daily News that New York state's Republican governor, George Pataki, wanted to lay the cornerstone to the new building during this year's convention. With the political winds blowing against them, he did it on July 4 instead. \"If you were to do something overtly political around Ground Zero you'd get hammered for it, and rightly so,\" says Michael McKeon, a Republican strategist and a former senior aide to Pataki.</p> <p>Sitting in a field last week just outside Orange, Connecticut, about 20 mostly young people were discussing non-violence. They were about two thirds of the way through a 258-mile march from Boston, scene of the Democratic party convention, toNew York, where they plan to protest. Six miles and several hours earlier they had set off from New Haven, Connecticut, crossing paths with the \"Stonewalk\" - a procession of family members of 9/11 victims, pulling a 1,400 pound granite memorial honouring the \"Un known civilians killed in war\", also heading for the Republican convention.</p> <p>Around two thirds of the 50 or so on the march would describe themselves as anarchists, although there are Buddhists, pacifists and others for whom knowing that they could not bear another four years of Bush is enough. \"I don't have a problem with people telling the police to go fuck themselves,\" says one, prompting a debate about the issue of verbal as opposed to physical violence. Also under discussion is the issue of whether to \"go limp\" or \"unarrest people\" if the police try to take them away.</p> <p>None of these people have walked all this way to \"make nice\". But this particular band of vegan, non-hierarchical political travellers are not out to carve great chunks out of the Big Apple either. Like the authorities, however, they feel the need to be prepared if things do spiral out of control. With no venue so far agreed for the main demonstration on Sunday, and tempers rising over the FBI's tough stance, there is plenty of scope for tensions to flare into something more serious.</p> <p>The last time the issue of violence dominated a national political convention was Chicago in 1968. Back then there was a war in a far-off land, a divisive Republican candidate in Richard Nixon and a mayor who pledged not to compromise. The police responded to verbal abuse from protesters and occasional missiles with tear gas and occasional beatings. Connecticut senator Abraham Ribicoff took to the podium to decry \"Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago\". It was a public relations disaster for the Democrats, and Nixon went on a few months later to defeat Hubert Humphrey.</p> <p>With Kerry taking a moderate stance on the war, these demonstrations have little, if anything, to do with the Democratic party. None the less, many believe that whoever is responsible, a rash of violence so close to the election will once again benefit the Republicans. \"If I were a voice in top Republican circles, I might be offering this advice: 'What we need for New York is a large-scale riot,' \" wrote Norman Mailer in New York magazine recently, in a public written exchange with his son. \"I don't have a great deal of hope that most of the people involved are really thinking of this election so much as expressing the need to vent, to gain some self-therapy.\"</p> <p>\"You do get a sense that the spiritual revolution may be awakening,\" replied his son, John Mailer, who believes that the protests could provide a focus for a huge anti-corporate movement. \"All right,\" replied Norman. \"But if we lose the election, it's going to be a very expensive spiritual education.\"</p>",
  "Osama bin Laden's Yemeni driver will today become the first Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoner to stand before a US military commission to face war crimes charges, in proceedings that have been denounced as unfair by human rights groups and American military lawyers. <p>Defence lawyers for Salim Ahmed Hamdan and three other prisoners facing preliminary hearings this week are expected to challenge the legality of the proceedings, and the nature of interrogations under which the defendants made statements. </p> <p>Unlike courts martial for US soldiers, there is no right of appeal to an independent civilian court. Instead appeals will be heard by another panel appointed by the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. </p> <p>\"This is a throwback,\" Eugene Fidell, a Washington lawyer specialising in military law, said. He said that the last time such tribunals were held was during the second world war, when suspected German saboteurs were put on trial . </p> <p>\"There are questions of independence and impartiality of the kind that would make eyebrows twitch in Strasbourg\" - home of the European court of human rights - Mr Fidell said. </p> <p>Mr Hamdan is in the first batch of four Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoners to face preliminary hearings by the commission, made up of five US officers and chaired by a retired army colonel, Peter Brownback. </p> <p>David Hicks, a former Australian kangaroo hunter turned Islamic jihadist, will face war crimes and attempted murder charges tomorrow, followed by Ali Hamza al-Bahlul, a Yemeni poet, and a Sudanese accountant, Ibrahim al-Qosi. </p> <p>Mr Bahlul and Mr Qosi are alleged to have acted as bodyguards for Bin Laden. According to his US military lawyer, Mr Hamdan worked as a driver for the al-Qaida leader at his farm near Kandahar until his capture in November 2001. </p> <p>The lawyer, Lieutenant Commander Charles Swift, said the 34-year-old Yemeni knew nothing about his boss's links to terrorist attacks against the US. The prosecution accuses him of conspiracy, arguing that not only did Mr Hamdan know about the terrorist plots, he also delivered arms to al-Qaida. </p> <p>Mr Hicks fought with the Kosovo Liberation Army in 1999 and converted to Islam in 2000. He is alleged to have attended al-Qaida training camps from January 2001 and to have met Bin Laden once. None of the defendants is accused of killing Americans, but they could all face life sentences. </p> <p>The hearings will take place in a specially built T-shaped courthouse overlooking the sea at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay base, an isolated US outpost on the south-eastern tip of Cuba. The defendants will have the charges read to them. </p> <p>Observers from the American Bar Association and international human rights groups will attend the proceedings, along with journalists. But they will be excluded when classified information is discussed. Photographs and sketches of the participants are banned. </p> <p>Defence lawyers have complained that they have been given severely limited access to their clients, and until recently have not been given interpreters. The lawyers and human rights groups have criticised many of the regulations, including the admission of hearsay as evidence and the government's right to monitor conversations between defendants and lawyers. </p> <p>John Altenburg, a retired major-general supervising the commissions, said no such monitoring had taken place so far. </p> <p>\"So the effect of monitoring of attorney-client discussions is speculative,\" he said, adding: \"The attorney has to be advised that that's going to happen. The expectation is the attorney will tell his client that this is happening. And lastly, any information gleaned from that monitoring will be completely firewalled from the prosecution and the criminal investigators and will be kept in national security intelligence channels only.\" </p> <p>Mr Altenburg said that, as in US civil trials, defendants had the right not to testify and would be presumed innocent until proved otherwise and that guilt would have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. </p> <p>However, Mr Fidell said that there were likely to be severe restrictions on the defendants' right to call witnesses. </p> <p>In June, the supreme court ruled that Guant\u00e1namo Bay fell under the jurisdiction of US civilian courts and that the prisoners therefore had the right to challenge their incarceration in court. In response, however, the Pentagon has established its own review boards to hear the challenges in an attempt to avoid inmates taking their case to district courts in America. </p> <p>The commission could set trial dates for the four men at this week's hearings, but defence lawyers could also ask for a delay, arguing they have not had sufficient time to talk to the defendants. Some have only been given interpreters in the past few days.</p>",
  "North Korea yesterday called President Bush an \"imbecile\" and \"a tyrant that puts Hitler into the shade\" in a stream of insults that seemed to rule out any progress on nuclear disarmament talks before the US presidential elections. <p>\"The meeting of the working group for the six-party talks cannot be opened because the US has become more undisguised in pursuing its hostile policy toward North Korea,\" a foreign ministry spokesman told the state-controlled news agency. </p> <p>New talks are due to be held in Beijing in September or October, as North Korea's neighbours and the US seek to per suade it to stop making nuclear weapons. </p> <p>Yesterday's tirade was apparently set off by a campaign stop remark last week by President Bush, who referred to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, as a \"tyrant\". </p> <p>Pyongyang's diplomatic spokesman called Mr Bush \"an idiot, an ignorant, a tyrant and a man-killer\". </p> <p>He added: \"Bush's assumption of office turned a peaceful world into a pandemonium unprecedented in history as it is plagued with a vicious circle of terrorism and war. The president's aides and allies are \"a typical gang of political gangsters\". </p> <p>John Kerry, the Democrat presidential candidate, has indicated that, if elected president, he would pursue direct bilateral talks with North Korea within the existing six-country framework. He has criticised President Bush for promising to pull out a third of the 36,000 US troops in South Korea without any reciprocal military concession from Pyongyang. </p> <p>\"The North Koreans made it very clear, politely, that they want Kerry to win the election,\" said C Kenneth Quinones, a former US diplomat who was in Pyongyang earlier this month for a Korean studies conference. \"Nobody wants to move. North Koreans are going to play wait and see.\" </p> <p>Mr Quinones, who worked on talks in 1994 that led to a first nuclear control accord with North Korea, added: \"The six-party talks have stabilised the situation. But the process will require the US to sit down with the North Koreans in a smoke-filled room for three months and bring out an agreement.\" </p> <p>In Pyongyang, official irritation with the US has increased with the passage last month by the House of Representatives of the North Korean human rights act, a bill that seeks to support North Korean refugees in China. </p> <p>Increasingly nervous over the defector issue, North Korea has criticised South Korea for taking 460 North Korean refugees to Seoul last month.</p>",
  "<p>Some managers are never satisfied. Rafael Ben\u00edtez's new side may be unbeaten in the Premiership and virtually through to the Champions League proper but for him there remains considerable scope for improvement. </p> <p>The Austrians of Grazer AK are likely to feel the brunt of that desire for perfection this evening as Liverpool, comfortable 2-0 victors in the first leg, aim to reach the lucrative group stage.

If you control the situation, those defensive problems can be cancelled out. It's not just about the defenders, it's about the mentality of the team. </p> <p>\"We have to have more confidence in ourselves. We can play better and we will. We have to stop teams in the build-up well short of our box. When I arrived at Valencia we were very powerful in defence but had problems in attack. Here they don't have a big defensive mentality.

  "<p>The government is facing a growing backlash from charities over a \"naked seizure of control\" of up to \u00a3700m a year of national lottery funding.</p> <p>Voluntary sector organisations gave a cautious welcome to the plans announced earlier this month by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, which set out how the Big Lottery Fund (BLF), the new body that distributes half of all the good causes money raised by the lottery, will work.</p> <p>But opposition to the plans has grown because \u00a31.2bn of cash will be handed out over the next four years under three themes - with linked outcomes - laid down by the government. </p> <p>The themes are community learning and creating opportunity, promoting community safety and cohesion and promoting well-being. Charities say this marks the \"assumption of government authority\" over lottery funding for charities.</p> <p>The BLF has been formed from an \"administrative merger\" of the Community Fund, originally set up to provide grants to charities, and the New Opportunities Fund (NOF), which has funded schemes in line with the three government priorities of health, education and the environment. </p> <p>Controversially, the government has often prescribed specific schemes that the NOF must fund, such as buying MRI scanners for NHS hospitals. </p> <p>BLF chairman, Sir Clive Booth, has stressed that ministers will no longer be able to direct funding in this way and that his organisation is not the \"NOF in disguise\".</p> <p>But angry charities are focusing on the stream of funding inherited from the Community Fund, which ran an open grants programme entirely independently of government priorities, with no equivalent of Ms Jowell's themes.</p> <p>The Acevo head of policy, Nick Aldridge, said: \"Rapid moves towards overarching themes suggest that decision-making in the BLF will be top down, paying little heed to the voluntary sector's priorities. </p> <p>\"We want the BLF to remain true to the spirit of the lottery. It should be genuinely independent of government priority areas, responding instead to needs identified by the sector.\"</p> <p>Stephen Bubb, Acevo's chief executive, has written to BLF chief executive Stephen Dunmore, saying: \"You will appreciate ... my members' present suspicion that outcomes such as healthier eating and better parenting, while very laudable, have more connection with present ministerial initiatives than any process of consultation with the sector.\"</p> <p>An email survey carried out by the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo) found 88% of charity chief executives opposed tying lottery grants to the government's themes. Just 17 of 139 charity chiefs backed the move.</p> <p>Asked if they would support the retention of an open grants programme, just one chief executive said no, with more than 99% in favour.</p> <p>Charity experts, the Directory of Social Change, described Ms Jowell's announcement as \"the long feared, but unexpectedly naked seizure of control by government of what was once a stream of independent charitable funding\". </p> <p>DSC researcher Luke FitzHerbert said it marked \"the final assumption of government authority over lottery funding through charities\". </p> <p>The Community Fund had been about supporting charities in their own self-defined activity, Mr FitzHerbert argued. Now it has been \"completely transformed for charities to carry out government purposes\", he said.</p> <p>Mr FitzHerbert said he was not entering the debate about whether the government's three themes were good or bad. \"The issue is that they are government chosen, not charity chosen.\" </p> <p>Campbell Robb, public policy director at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said: \"Whilst it is appropriate for government to be involved in setting the overarching themes under which the BLF will fund, it is completely inappropriate that they are involved in the setting of the specific outcomes these themes are set to achieve.\"</p> <p>He added that continuing an open access grant programme was \"vitally important\" and said NCVO would call for the amount allocated to the open \"Awards for All\" scheme should be expanded to at least \u00a3250m a year, with maximum grants of \u00a3100,000 a year. </p> <p>Vanessa Potter, policy and external relations director at the Big Lottery Fund, said: \"The DCMS framework is broad and flexible, and gives us a lot of scope to develop our funding programmes and the way we fund. We've made it clear to the government we would not welcome a direction that would force us to distribute elements of our funding in a certain way.</p> <p>\"Instead, it will be a matter for the board to decide how we will deliver against the outcomes and priorities the government has set us and in a way which maximises the benefits to communities. I am sure large elements of these programmes will be \"open\" or lightly prescribed.\"</p>",
  "<p>British Airways today cancelled 30 flights from Heathrow airport, causing a second day of travel chaos for thousands of passengers.</p> <p>The cancellations left the airline struggling to cope with demand in what is the busiest travel month of the year. </p> <p>Yesterday, BA had to cancel 25 flights due to staff shortages and technical problems with three aircraft that had been due to make long-haul trips to the US. Hundreds of passengers spent the night on the airport floor when their flights failed to materialise. </p> <p>With the BA's Heathrow operations this morning running below strength by an estimated 120 staff due to sickness and extra demand, several check-in desks at the busy London airport were unmanned. </p> <p>The problems meant BA was forced to shelve 30 flights - 15 outgoing and 15 incoming - to short-haul destinations in domestic and European locations.</p> <p>Airline officials had hoped that last weekend's union deal, which centred on the issue of absenteeism and averted a threatened bank holiday strike, would end the prospect of travel misery and heavy financial losses this summer. </p> <p>However, 7,500 passengers have already been affected by this week's disruption, which comes at one of the busiest times of the year for the airline industry. </p> <p>Last night 2,000 passengers were stranded at Heathrow. Five hundred were provided with hotel accommodation and some returned home, while the rest had to spend an uncomfortable night in the terminals. </p> <p>Some of the more fortunate passengers were accommodated on later flights, while others had to rebook.</p> <p>Passengers reported chaotic scenes at the airport, with the BA customer service desk besieged by angry customers frustrated by a lack of information. Those scenes are set to be repeated tonight, with further cancellations likely.</p> <p>BA - which would normally expect to carry around 100,000 passengers a day during the August period - today told travellers to expect further minor delays to short-haul journeys, advising customers to check its website for information.</p> <p>A company spokesman this afternoon said that no more cancellations were expected. </p> <p>BA had earlier apologised to passengers for the disruption, blaming the cancellations on a combination of technical problems and \"stretched\" services at Heathrow.</p> <p>The planned 24-hour walkout by BA check-in and baggage handling staff had centred on a contentious company policy aiming to cut average staff sick leave rates from 17 days a year to 10 within 12 months. BA believes high absenteeism rates are costing it \u00a330m a year.</p> <p>In the last-minute deal that averted the strike, the airline agreed to pay a \u00a31,000 bonus to baggage handlers and check-in staff, plus an 8.5% pay rise over three years, in return for union support for the policy. </p> <p>However, this week's problems are thought to be caused in part by sickness and also because staff are unwilling to take up overtime offers during what is the busiest and most stressful period of the working year.</p> <p>A BA spokesman today said the airline's Heathrow operation was short of full strength \"mainly due to sickness, and also the fact that we had more people leaving at the beginning of the summer than we expected\".</p> <p>\"We are recruiting, but the main problem with recruiting is not only training but also the security aspect,\" he added.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A journalist took a fake bomb onto an international flight from Birmingham airport, the Sun said today.</p> <p>The paper's undercover reporter, Anthony France, used bogus references to get a baggage handling job at the airport. </p> <p>Last week, he was able to take the \"device\" into the hold of a 757-200 flight to Majorca, which was carrying 220 passengers, without being challenged or detected, the newspaper said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> After attending a work convention abroad last year I am currently owed expenses incurred during the trip. According to the foreign bank that is reimbursing me, the money has been forwarded to my UK bank account, but my bank says it has not received the money. Both banks are saying the money has to be traced by the other and the foreign bank is refusing to reissue the payment. Who is responsible for tracing the money and how do I resolve this stalemate?</p> <p><strong>EF</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> It all rather depends on where the bank issuing the payment is situated. According to the Association of Payment and Clearing Services (Apacs), the UK bank clearing system, if the foreign bank is in the EU, then it is the one responsible for sorting out the missing payment. </p> <p>EU legislation states that it is the responsibility of the sending bank to trace - and if necessary, re-issue - a payment that doesn't arrive at the receiving bank. This makes a lot of sense - if your bank hasn't received a payment, the sending bank might be able to trace what went wrong with the transfer. </p> <p>Perhaps a digit was keyed in wrong and the money went to someone else's account, or the transfer was set up to be paid in August 2005 by mistake. Clearly, your bank would have no way of working out what has happened, which is why it is the sending bank's responsibility.</p> <p>What's more, if the payment is not sorted out within a specific timeframe, the sending bank will have to start paying you interest on the sum owed. This timeframe is calculated as 14 days after the day you first inform the sending bank that payment has not been received within the agreed period (for example, if the sending bank said the sum would be in your account within five working days, say).</p> <p>Even if the bank is outside the EU, Apacs was reasonably confident that similar legislation would apply and the resolution of the issue would still come down to the sending bank.</p>",
  "Applications for asylum in the UK fell by 13% during April, May and June, according to new Home Office figures released today. <p>The quarterly figures show that new applications, including dependants, totalled 9,210 - while the figure excluding dependants dropped to 7,920, a 26% reduction on the same period last year.</p> <p>The publication of the figures, in one of the most highly charged areas of government policy, is always a cause of controversy, with the Conservatives branding the figures \"meaningless\" and the government's approach \"chaotic and inefficient\" even before the numbers were announced.</p> <p>Applications reached a peak in 2002, with nearly 25,000 claims per quarter, and have been a political hot potato for most of the past decade, with the tabloid press often splashing on the issue several days a week.</p> <p>Today the immigration and asylum minister, Des Browne, credited part of the reduction to the installation of UK immigration officials in France and Belgium. He also attacked the opposition for taking up the official figures when they showed an increase, and dismissing them as \"unreliable\" when they showed a fall.</p> <p><b>Breakdown of figures</b><br></p> <p>A breakdown of today's figures shows that Iran is now the most common country of origin, with 685 applications. Somalia was knocked into third place with 540 applications, below China's 595. Applications from Iraq increased by 20% to 410.</p> <p>The number of failed asylum seekers being deported from the UK was also significantly reduced. Including dependants, 3,725 were removed from Britain - 9% fewer than in the previous three months and 18% fewer than in the same period last year. </p> <p>The Home Office report said the fall in removals was \"due to a large extent to fewer removals of nationals of the 10 countries which joined the EU on May 1\".</p> <p>Of the 11,720 initial decisions made on asylum applications, 3% (355) were granted asylum, 7% (855) were granted discretionary leave to remain in the UK, 40 (0.34%) were granted humanitarian protection and 89% (10,470) were refused. </p> <p>The independent Immigration Appellate Authority received 11,970 appeals in the period. Of those, 2,755 appeals were allowed - 20% down from 22% the previous quarter.</p> <p>Revised asylum figures for 2003 showed applications excluding dependants fell by 41% to 49,405, with an estimated 28% being awarded asylum, leave to remain or humanitarian protection, or winning on appeal.</p> <p><b>'Chaotic and shambolic'</b></p> <p>Conservative home affairs spokesman Humfrey Malins said that a small fall in the asylum figures was meaningless. </p> <p>\"This government has had a chaotic and shambolic policy for the last few years. They are hopelessly inefficient,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>\"If there are fewer asylum applications in the last quarter, most people believe that that could mean greater numbers of people are still entering the country illegally, because our borders are not secure, and simply not bothering to claim asylum.\"</p> <p>But Mr Browne - who took over what David Blunkett described as the most difficult job outside the cabinet in April after the resignation of Beverley Hughes - said: \"When these asylum figures, prepared in exactly the same way by exactly the same officials and published in exactly the same way, showed about 18 months ago historically high figures of asylum seekers, they [the Tories] were happy to rely upon them.</p> <p>\"Now that they are dropping significantly, and have been over the last 18 months, they are no longer reliable figures. Isn't that surprising?\"</p> <p>He later added: \"We will shortly be implementing the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004 which makes it an offence to arrive without papers or to fail to cooperate with re-documentation and which will speed up the appeals process. </p> <p>\"These will start to bite - just as our previous legislation has made a difference - making it easier for us to remove people who have no legitimate right to be in this country.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats said that an obsession with numbers was \"wrong\", since a disaster in Iraq or Somalia should mean an increase in asylum numbers.</p> <p>Their home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said: \"If there was a disaster in Somalia or Iraq, surely we would want to see an increase because it would mean that we were taking people who were fleeing persecution.</p> <p>\"So having this kind of fall may be absolutely meaningless because it could actually be a result of poor information [and] bad decisions being taken.\"</p> <p><b>Charity reaction</b><br></p> <p>Asylum charities pointed out that despite the fall in numbers there was no indication that the world had become safer, with the figures coming as the humanitarian situation in Sudan caused international concern.</p> <p>The number of applications for asylum in the UK from Sudanese nationals dropped by 30% to only 265 in the first quarter of this year, the Refugee Council's deputy chief executive, Margaret Lally, said.</p> <p>\"The government must turn its attention to what really matters - its responsibility to provide protection to those who need our help,\" she said.</p> <p>The chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Habib Rahman, said: \"The UK's increasingly harsh asylum system, which includes imprisonment of asylum seekers and forcible deportations, may be responsible for driving many asylum seekers underground if they manage to reach this country.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The fact that millions of people worldwide continue to suffer under repressive regimes, yet do not claim asylum in the UK, is not necessarily a cause for celebration.\"</p> <p> In all, 70,600 asylum seekers were receiving welfare payments or accommodation at the end of the period, according to the figures - 7% down on the previous three months and 22% down period-on-period.</p> <p>It was the Home Office's calculation of these two sets of figures - removals and numbers being supported - which came in for the most serious criticism in a National Audit Office report in May.</p> <p>The spending watchdogs said the totals had missed out up to 24,000 asylum seekers receiving welfare and accommodation funding, and that there was no evidence to confirm that removals from the UK had actually taken place in 6% of 48 cases analysed. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Separate figures published today showed 139,675 immigrants were granted leave to stay in the UK during 2003, 20% more than in the previous year. </p> <p>The figure included 29,600 people given employment-related grants, a rise of 50%, and 65,800 allowed to stay on family grounds, up 25%. </p> <p>The shadow home secretary accused the government of handing out work permits \"like confetti\" to meet Mr Blair's public targets on asylum. David Davis said: \"It's astonishing that we are removing fewer failed asylum seekers than before, when there are tens of thousands of people who shouldn't be here. </p> <p>\"Hidden in these figures are tens of thousands of people who would never have been allowed to stay before. </p> <p>\"That's why Britain has a reputation as a soft touch, and that's why a new Sangatte is opening up a mile down the road from the old one.\" </p> <p>\"These figures have become utterly discredited. The government have fiddled everything to meet Tony Blair's target on asylum, even if that means ignoring illegal immigrants and handing out work permits like confetti.\"</p>",
  "Maoist rebels in Nepal today said they would lift a blockade of Kathmandu that has choked the capital of supplies for the past week, but warned of serious reprisals if their demands were not met by the government. <p>In a statement, the rebels announced: \"The indefinite transport blockade has been postponed for one month with effect from August 25.\"</p> <p>But the rebels added that a \"tougher programme\" would begin if the government failed to release jailed guerrillas and make public the whereabouts of missing rebel suspects. They did not say what their further measures would involve. </p> <p>The government, which has agreed to investigate the cases of missing guerrillas but refused to free jailed suspects, has yet to respond to today's statement. </p> <p>The announcement came just hours after rebel gunmen ambushed an army lorry on the motorway linking Kathmandu to Tibet, killing at least four soldiers and wounding two others.</p> <p>Rebels did not erect a single road barrier in the week-long blockade of Kathmandu; instead they relied on the fear their attacks have instilled in the local population.</p> <p>Few truck drivers dared to defy the rebels, who detonated several bombs in the capital and fatally shot two people to scare residents off the streets. They also threatened to ambush any vehicles on the roads to Kathmandu and succeeded in cutting the capital off from the rest of the country. </p> <p>As a result, the tiny mountain city suffered severe goods shortages. Thousands of people were stranded in Kathmandu, and only a handful of buses were escorted by soldiers out of the city. Vegetable prices tripled and officials said they had only a few more days of cooking fuel in stock. </p> <p>\"The Maoists claimed to be fighting for the impoverished, and it was the impoverished who were suffering the most in the blockade,\" analyst Shyam Shreshta told Reuters. </p> <p>The guerrillas have waged an eight-year campaign to replace the tiny Himalayan kingdom's constitutional monarchy with Maoist communism. More than 9,500 people have died since the insurgency began in 1996. </p> <p>The guerrillas, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been launching bolder attacks in recent months. </p> <p>Last August the Maoists walked out of peace talks and withdrew from a seven-month ceasefire. </p> <p>But the Nepalese deputy prime minister, Bharat Mohan Adhikary, was today optimistic about the prospect of ending the civil war, Reuters reported. He told the news agency there were \"signs\" that the guerrillas, who currently control around two thirds of Nepal, were planning to return to the negotiating table. </p> <p>Analysts say the unprecedented blockade of Kathmandu could be a tactic to extract concessions from the government before talks begin.</p>",
  "<p>Google, the search engine which floated on the Nasdaq market last week, has the worst corporate governance structure of any company in the S&amp;P 500 index, according to an influential investor advisory group. </p> <p>Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises pension funds on how to vote at annual meetings, gives Google a withering 0.2 out of a possible 100 for effectiveness of its governance structure. </p> <p>It identifies 21 weaknesses, including too few outside directors and a capital structure using two classes of shares which allows the founders to retain control. However, the shares continued to attract buyers yesterday and were $1.09 higher at $109.40 by the close in New York. The shares floated at $85. The brokerage Jefferies initiated coverage of Google yesterday, setting a price target of $115. </p> <p>In an interview with the Financial Times, Patrick McGurn, senior vice president of ISS, cited perceived problems, including a compensation plan that allows the company to reprice stock options if the shares fall below a certain value and a lack of share ownership guidelines for executives or independent directors. </p> <p>Google was forced to pare back the price range for its IPO, as well as cutting the number of shares on offer, due to apparent lukewarm demand.

  "<p>For nine months, I have been fanatically committed to doing four Pilates workouts a week. Like yoga, Pilates is a contemplative exercise, one that works mind and body. Throughout this year, as I've struggled to halve my daily dose of antidepressants, Pilates has been a major factor in helping me settle at 75mg Effexor XL a day. </p> <p>Last week, only having time for one workout, I discovered just how vital Pilates is to my mental wellbeing. I felt my mind speeding up. Thoughts got fuzzy, and I stopped thinking clearly. I found myself obsessing about random things. The annoying neighbour with the new, seven -trillion-decibel home-entertainment system. The letter from the credit-card company telling me that the APR on my card had tripled overnight. Oh, and death. </p> <p>Having just become a father, my will needs amending. Revisiting the details, I started wondering if it was really such a good idea to have a clause stating that I want my ashes scattered in Naples? Two years ago, that made perfect sense. Eternal pizza, coffee, sunshine. Suddenly it sounded impractical. In my prayers, I always hope that my wife and I will die simultaneously, cuddled up under a fancy Missoni duvet that we've blown our retirement nest egg on. If that's the way we go, will our daughter really want to fly out to Italy to scatter dad in the Bay of Naples? </p> <p>Realising that my mind was spiralling into a morbid, anxious spaghetti, I took the phone off the hook, and unfurled my garish blue mat and popped a Pilates DVD in the machine. An hour later, the tension was gone; the sadness and lethargy too. I had energy! Felt excited! Ready for anything! The neighbour? Bring on the action movies at a window-rattling volume. The credit-card headache? Get a card with a 0% balance transfer rate. The will? Put some money away to cover the cost of the \"Dad's Snuffed-It Trip\". Label the funds \"The Ashes to Ashes Tour\". Just like that, life was manageable again. </p> <p>So why is Pilates so effective in containing my depression and anxiety? To find out, I popped the question to Moira Merrithew, master trainer and co-founder of Stott Pilates. Here's what she told me: \"When someone is depressed or anxious there is a feeling of losing control of their life or certain aspects of their life. We can also lose touch of our bodies, shutting out our physical side. Pilates, a mind-body exercise, puts people back in touch with their bodies, creates body awareness and educates them on how they can move to feel good about themselves and eventually more confident. The movements tend to have a similar effect as a body massage, while helping people gain the control and body awareness they may have lost. Pilates also has a meditative quality which helps calm the mind and reduce stress. Muscular tension is reduced and muscular strength is gained. Students leave a session feeling energised.\" </p> <p>I put the same question to Alycea Ungaro, the owner of Real Pilates NYC and author of Pilates: Body in Motion and The Pilates Promise. Her take? \"Pilates can be a mental and emotional respite for those suffering from depression, anxiety or everyday stress. Pilates forces you to focus inward for the duration of the workout, by concentrating on the detail, form and execution of each exercise. Pilates can rejuvenate the mind and restore the spirit. I sometimes think the benefits are almost in line with those of meditation. </p> <p>'At Real Pilates, we work with individuals who have had bouts of depression and anxiety. These clients walk in with a look of tension, sometimes even despair. They respond in an enormously positive way. Anxiety and depression can be overwhelming. But when you see your own body performing healthy, active and elegant moves, it restores your faith and belief in what you can achieve. A healthy self-image is incredibly positive and enormously empowering. The innate structure of the system serves as a mental nap. If you could put away your problems for a set period of time each day, you would have a fresh perspective when you returned to your daily life.\" </p> <p>It's true, Pilates does feel meditative. When depression or anxiety take hold, a paradoxical rot of physical lethargy and mental frenzy sets in. I struggle to concentrate on any thought for more than a second while finding simple physical tasks like making the bed indescribably exhausting. That's why yoga and Pilates work for me - they energise my body and calm my mind. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nickjohnstone.com\">www.nickjohnstone.com</a></p>",
  "On April 25 1986, 24-year-old Sasha Yuvchenko clocked on as usual for the night shift at the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine. It was a beautiful evening, particularly warm and clear, and Yuvchenko, an engineer-mechanic, and his workmates were full of their plans for the upcoming May Day holidays. At home, his wife, Natasha, was still up with their fretful two-year-old, Kirill. <p>On that fateful night, the water pumps in the newly commissioned No 4 reactor were being safety-tested. As the clock ticked past midnight, an argument was raging about the right power level at which to start the test. But what no one knew, thanks to years of error and cover up, was that there was a fatal flaw in the reactor design that made it unstable at low power levels. As power levels were lowered in preparation for the test, they dropped too low and the reactor ground to a halt. Meanwhile, unseen, a dangerous hot spot was building deep in the reactor. </p> <p>To raise the power, the boron control rods were removed. It was like cocking a gun, and when, at 1.20am on April 26 1986, the test began and the turbines were turned off, the reactor was turned into a volcanic steam pressure cooker. Emergency shutdown procedures were started, but when the control rods were reinserted, their graphite tips caused the power levels to rise so dramatically that a portion of the reactor was destroyed. There were two explosions and the 500-tonne safety cap was blown off the reactor. It was the worst nuclear accident in history. </p> <p>Yuvchenko, now 42, recalls what happened that terrible night 18 years ago. He is a bear of a man, 6ft 5in tall, and a former Soviet champion rower. You can't help but notice his left arm, which is half the size of his right and shiny with scar tissue. His wife, Natasha, sits nervously on the edge of her seat. </p> <p>\"There was a heavy thud,\" he says. \"A couple of seconds later, I felt a wave come through the room. The thick concrete walls were bent like rubber. I thought war had broken out. We started to look for Khodemchuk (his colleague) but he had been by the pumps and had been vaporised. Steam wrapped around everything; it was dark and there was a horrible hissing noise. There was no ceiling, only sky; a sky full of stars.\" A stream of ionising radiation was shooting starwards, like a laser beam. \"I remember thinking how beautiful it was.\" </p> <p>Yuvchenko went with a party of men to recce the damaged reactor hall. He stayed outside, propping the heavy reactor hall door open with his shoulder. The three men who went in all died within two weeks. \"You don't feel anything at the time,\" he explains. \"We had no idea there was so much radiation. We met a guy with a doseometer and the needle was just off the dial. But even then, we were still only thinking 'Rats, this means the end of our careers in the nuclear industry. We all thought, 'We've been exposed now, this has happened on our watch' and set about doing what we could. After about an hour, I started to vomit uncontrollably. My throat was very sore.\" </p> <p>By 6am, he could no longer walk. He was taken to the local hospital. Still he had no idea of the huge hit of radiation he'd received. \"We were thinking we might have had 20, perhaps 50rem. But there was a man there who'd been involved in a nuclear accident in the submarine fleet, he said it was more serious than that. 'You don't vomit at 50,' he said.\" </p> <p>At the hospital, they worked out (through measuring the fall in his white blood-cell count) that he'd received 410rem - or as it's now since been styled, 4.1Sv (one sievert is equal to 100rem) - a measure of the absorbed dose of radiation per kilogram of body weight. Four sieverts is lethal for half of those affected. </p> <p>In the EU, the maximum dose of radiation to which the population near a nuclear power station should be exposed to is one millisievert (mSv) a year and for nuclear workers, it is 20mSv annually. The average radiation dose from natural and medical radiation is 2.5mSv. The plant workers and firefighters at Chernobyl received 650 times their permitted yearly dose and more than 5,000 times the average annual dose. </p> <p>Yuvchenko was seen once by a nurse during this time but was interviewed three times by the KGB. Startling film taken by the KGB of the devastated reactor is shown in a new documentary, Zero Hour: Disaster at Chernobyl. Whoever took the film is likely to have died. </p> <p>Yuvchenko was then shipped off to Moscow. No one told Natasha where he was. A rule of thumb is that vomiting that starts within half an hour of irradiation indicates a fatal dose. Of those transported with him, five died. Those who died quickly were lucky. It is a truly horrible way to die, burnt from within and without. </p> <p>Some 128 people were sent to the specialised treatment centre in Moscow. When Yuvchenko arrived, his head was shaved, but within days all his body hair fell out anyway. By now all were experiencing the effects of radiation to their lungs, nose, ears and throats. For those with severe exposures, rubber-like mucus caused breathing problems, and herpes-like rashes formed massive crusts on lips and facial skin. Those who had started vomiting early were given bone-marrow transplants. Yuvchenko received the first of many transfusions. </p> <p>Nobody knows quite how radiation produces its early effects of nausea and diarrhoea. When the vomiting subsides, there is a period of calm. There is seemingly trivial reddening of the skin at first, but, again after a period of calm, the skin develops weeping ulcerations over layers of dead tissue. Yuvchenko recalls pulling back the sheets, and there being a cloud of black dust - his dead skin. A slime of gamma and beta-emitting nuclides had covered all surfaces in the plant after the explosion, and where his body had touched the door - his left shoulder, hip and calf - their deadly radiation had gnawed away at his flesh, causing the death of tissue deep in his arm. It became grossly swollen and his skin turned violet black. </p> <p>He had the first of many, many operations and skin grafts. For a while, he thought that his arm would be amputated. Those champion muscles were his saviour. \"Mine are small,\" he laughs, \"you should see my little brother's.\" His arm was to be in bandages for the next seven years. He was plagued by - and occasionally still has - outbreaks of skin ulceration. Microsurgery in Berlin, in which blood vessels were transferred from his leg to his irradiated arm, finally saw him on the road to recovery. His colleagues were not all as lucky. One who worked in the turbine hall and took 10Sv survived a bone-marrow transplant and blindness only to die after a few months. </p> <p>Death after acute radiation exposure usually comes from infection as the radiation destroys bone-marrow cells, causing a catastrophic drop in infection-fighting white blood cells. The body is overwhelmed, particularly where there is intense damage to skin and intestine. People assume that there is something that you can take to prevent radiation damage, as they do in Star Trek. Potassium iodate tablets, taken within hours of exposure, flood the thyroid, and make uptake of radioactive iodine less likely. But iodine is only one of the radionuclides. Supportive care and rigorous infection control is all the medical care there is. </p> <p>Yuvchenko spent a year in hospital and a further two in rehab. He attributes his survival to his treatment in Moscow - and those muscles. He doesn't know whether he is infertile - although this is highly likely - but in any case, was advised not to have another child because of the risk that they, or their children, would develop leukaemia. Chromosomal damage over 4Sv is severe. What of his prospects now, particularly of cancer? </p> <p>\"The doctors told me that if you've survived this, you shouldn't worry about anything else.\" Every year, he has two weeks of check-ups. \"I always think they might find something.\" But he has remained well, as has his wife and son, a tribute to the extraordinary repair properties of DNA. </p> <p>\"It's the nerves that get you,\" says Natasha. For many years, people literally ran away from them, terrified of contamination. The fear of radiation and what could happen, may yet prove to be a bigger killer than radiation itself. There have been nearly 2,000 cases of thyroid cancer, mostly in children, but the predicted surge in other types of cancer has, according to the Unscear 2000 report, not yet been seen. But there have been big increases in deaths from heart disease, alcoholism and suicide in Belarus and Ukraine. </p> <p>Yuvchenko considers himself lucky, especially compared with those whose extraordinary heroism finally brought the incident under control. Yuvchenko has a generous pension; they had nothing. And asked what he now thinks of the future of civil nuclear power, his answer is emphatic, and perhaps surprising. \"If one learns the lessons and keeps safety as the number-one priority in all developments, then it is safe.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Zero Hour: Disaster at Chernobyl will be shown on the Discovery Channel at 10pm on August 27</p>",
  "<p><strong>4.20pm:</strong> By the way, for further coverage please <a href=\"http://sport.theguardian.com/olympics2004/story/0,14912,1289901,00.html\">click here</a>.</p> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> That's me done. Thanks for all your emails - and best of luck to Dean Macey in his final two events. </p> <p><strong>3.55pm:</strong> Newton has retired. 65 laps left. </p> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> Our medal hope, Chris Newton, is apparently \"splintering under the pressure\". Oh dear. Russian Ignatyev is leading, German Guido Fulst is second. </p> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> Right. There's 80 laps to go. Milton Wynants of Uruguay leads. I think. </p> <p><strong>3.44pm:</strong> Meanwhile, Neil Golightly has an idea. \"In the modern pentathlon, the final event (cross country) has a staggered start, with the points leader going first and everyone else going at intervals according to how many points behind they are. This means that the winner actually is the person who crosses the finish line first. Wouldn't this liven up the decathlon no end?\". </p> <p><strong>3.40pm:</strong> Small technical hitch, but we're back. At the velodrome, the men's points race final is in progress. We're a quarter of the way through - still over 100 laps to go. </p> <p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> All becomes clear. The Swiss success on the beach volleyball court is apparently down to the fact that \"every half a year or so they fill Zurich train station with sand and pretend it's a beach\". You can almost hear those Hollywood scriptwriters sharpening their pencils. Or not. </p> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> Just to recap. Dean Macey's best attempt in the pole vault, the eighth decathlon event, saw him clear 4.40m but fail three attempts at 4.60m. That leaves him needing a superhuman effort in the javelin and the 1500m to catch Amercian Bryan Clay, who is 341 points ahead in the bronze position. The javelin starts at 5.30pm</p> <p><strong>3.19pm:</strong> Craig Doyle seems to have quite a fanclub. \"Hey, that 'fella from the Holiday programme' is the reason why so many women are enjoying the Beeb's coverage of the Olympics. He even has the ice maiden Ms Balding blushing and giggling under that fringe of hers. Nothing wrong with the BBC's coverage as far as I'm concerned. Bring on more eye candy for the ladeez,\" says Katie, who seems to have been taking spelling lessons from Noddy Holder. </p> <p><strong>3.16pm:</strong> Russian Tamilla Abassova has won the second, all-Russian semi final, to win the chance to race Muenzer in the final (he says, desperately trying to keep up with these races - which last roughly 12 seconds each). </p> <p><strong>3.13pm:</strong> \"The BBC coverage has been saved by two things,\" reckons Paul. \"Firstly Michael Johnson is the god of pundits and, secondly, the bloke who does the voiceovers for the event descriptions has decided that Alan Partridge should be his role model.\" Who is that?</p> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> Lori Ann Muenzer takes it to reach the final and guarantee at least a silver. </p> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> Canadian Lori Ann Muenzer is taking on Australian Anna Meares in the deciding heat of their sprint semi final. Cat and mouse stuff, this sprint cycling, as they battle for the inside berth.</p> <p><strong>3.08pm:</strong> In the meantime, there's some reasonably pointless sprints on the cycle track to decide who finishes where outside the medal positions. </p> <p><strong>3.02pm:</strong> Everybody, it seems, has an opinion on the BBC's coverage. Catherine reckons Craig Doyle is not doing a bad job. \"Certainly not as smarmy as on his recent Irish talk show. He does appear to have switched allegiances somewhere along the way, though, and keeps referring to \"us\" and \"we\" when talking about the British... Oi, Doyler, you're not Terry Wogan on the Eurovision, you know.\" Quite.</p> <p><strong>3.02pm:</strong>In the other semi-final 21-year-old Dutchman Theo Bos has won 2-0, so he's through to the final later today against Bailey. </p> <p><strong>3.01pm:</strong> \"Cool Runnings? Great film\" writes David, who is embarrassing himself. </p> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> Great finish as Bailey wins with a sprint finish to defeat reigning champ Gane and reach the final. </p> <p><strong>2.56pm:</strong> It's 1-1 in both women's semi finals. Now it's Australian Ryan Bailey against Frenchman Laurent Gane in the men's. Bailey is 1 race up. Best of three.</p> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> Over to the velodrome, where the women's sprint semi-finals are in progress... </p> <p><strong>2.51pm:</strong> Daniel has emailed from a well known high street bank (with a black horse for a logo) to say: \"In response to Jonathan Keith's query. Cheques take five days to go through because we need time to write into the Guardian's Olympic coverage.\" And the rest of the year?</p> <p><strong>2.50pm:</strong> Franco says he's \"glad to see the Swiss made it into the semi-finals of the beach volleyball. Given the lack of coastline, are they this year's Jamaican bobsledders?\" Maybe, though if it means sitting through another film of the calibre of Cool Runnings, is it anything to celebrate?</p> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong> On the bright side, Simon Hiscocks and Chris Draper have guaranteed Team GB their fourth sailing medal in the mixed 49er category. The British pair finished the day in third place overall and, with just one race remaining, cannot be caught by America, who are currently fourth. While they're unlikely to catch Spain following the final race on Thursday, they stand a definite chance of silver with the Ukraine only two points ahead in second place. Where would we be without the sailing?</p> <p><strong>2.41pm:</strong> You can put your calculators away. Macey's failure at his third attempt means the gap between Macey and Clay has been stretched out to 341 points. Effectively that leaves Macey needing an injury to his rival in the final two events to have a hope of snatching bronze. </p> <p><strong>2.38pm:</strong> \"To get back to the jack of all trades v master of none discussion,\" writes Jonathan Cardy. Go on then. \"Daley Thomson was on the telly last night over here in Germany and after trying to snog Katarina Witt he very casually mentioned that his best time for 100 meters was 10.26 seconds. That might not have earned him a medal the other night - but by my reckoning it makes him quicker than any of our current 100 meter sprinters and better than most others who specialise in this event.\" </p> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> Apparently we've missed an earthquake in the BBC studio. So says Ms Balding. To continue the theme from earlier today - what do we think of the Beeb's coverage so far?Do we agree with Labour MP Chris Bryant and the Sunday Times that it's smug and banal. Or are Balding, Cram, Rider and that fella from the Holiday programme doing a decent job?</p> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> The Brazilians have beaten the Swiss to reach the final of the men's beach volleyball, where they will meet Spain. </p> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> Jonathan Keith is not a happy man. \"Absolutely nothing to do with the Olympics (unless the swine are squandering more of my money on sponsorship, which they probably are), but how can a bank take five working days to clear a cheque in 2004? Maybe some of your readers can cast some light on the matter for me?\" Anyone? </p> <p><strong>2.20pm:</strong> Come on Dean! No...he's gone straight into the bar. Having passed at 4.50m, that leaves 4.40m as his best attempt. Let's hope he's saving himself for the javelin... </p> <p><strong>2.15pm:</strong> So, Macey has one attempt left at 4.60m. The pressure's on, particularly as some of his rivals for that bronze medal are now going clear at 5.00m. </p> <p><strong>2.10pm:</strong> Dean Macey has just failed his second attempt at 4.60m. He doesn't look happy and his medal hopes could be dwindling...</p> <p><strong>2.05pm:</strong> Hello, Owen Gibson here, as the baton is passed once more. The USA's Bryan Clay has just failed his final attempt at 5m in the decathlon pole vault</p> <p><strong>2pm:</strong> Dean Macey has appeared. Sadly he failed at 4.60m, but he has two more attempts. Roman Sebrle, in second place, has just cleared 4.90m. </p> <p>Jack Whibley wants to know: \"What's more important: success with women or getting mentions on the Guardian's 'Olympics: as it happens' site?\" Stick to the latter, Jack. Anyway, I'm off again.</p> <p><strong>1.52pm: </strong> Tom Pappas, who was in fifth position, has withdrawn from the decathlon after injuring his foot in the pole vault. Tough on the American, but a plus for Dean Macey's medal hopes. Maybe one day Macey will actually return to action in the pole vault. Just maybe.</p> <p>\"Seeing as you're quiet on the email front,\" starts Rob Mansfield tentatively, \"here's my tenuous link to one of this year's Olympic athletes. My mum is best friends with the mum of sailor Simon Hiscocks.\" Good, Rob, but no cigar. My girlfriend's mum is best friends with Sir Steve Redgrave's wife. Ha! Anyway, you had another point I believe. \"On the nerdy question front: I wonder if there's evidence to suggest that host nations always exceed expectations when it comes to performances and medals at Olympics. The Greeks definitely seem to be doing pretty well this year.\" Let's see. Obviously Australia did well in 2000, but then again they always do well. Ditto America in 1996. But, possible evidence in 1992 is that the Spaniards, who hitherto had won few gold medals, won a big bucket of them in Barcelona. I was only seven when the Games were in Seoul, so my memory does not stretch back that far.</p> <p><strong>1.45pm:</strong> Robbie McMillan has not quite entered the Olympic spirit: \"Synchronised swimming is up there with that skiing-walking thing which goes on forever and horses moving diagonally across loads of wood chippings.\" He has a point though. Still nothing to report.</p> <p><strong>1.39pm:</strong> Bryan Clay has just vaulted over 4.90pm, impressive by anyone's standards. Well, except Sergie Bubka's. Eurosport seem determined not to let me watch Dean Macey.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Colin Parselle has angered me. \"I've just been catching-up, and noticed that Australia beat Japan 1-0 in baseball,\" he says, with my ears pricking up because of my interest in baseball. \"Since when did baseball become an Olympic sport? Could you check how our plucky guys and girls are getting on with Olympic rounders, French cricket and bowls?\" Oh dear. Colin, baseball has been an Olympic sport for some time, it has retained its amateur(ish) status because the Major League players are not allowed/wouldn't want to compete, and has a far higher participation level in lots of countries than it does here. The real question should be how the Aussies have managed to beat Japan. They are the best at everything they turn their hand to, aren't they?</p> <p><strong>1.33pm:</strong> China have beaten their bitter rivals Japan by three games to nil in the quarter-final of the women's volleyball.</p> <p>Gary Partington has relieved my boredom: \"Not strictly related to the Olympics,\" ah, who cares, go on, continue, \"but out around Leeds city centre on my lunch break just now I passed the great Chris Kamara, apparently on a shopping trip with his other half. He'd been asked to pose for a snap with a (female) fan, and he didn't seem at all happy about it.\" Fascinating.</p> <p><strong>1.28pm:</strong> The synchronised swimming (yes, I have plunged this low) second stage is about to start. Russia lead Japan and the United States after the first day, having performed quite impeccably at periscope depth, in a special Athens pool. Oh, and they had the best carnival masks. So say the 14 judges poolside. There cannot be a sport where there are more judges, surely?</p> <p><strong>1.22pm:</strong> Dmitri Karpov has just cleared 4.50m in the pole vault. The Kazahkstan athlete leads the decathlon after seven events.</p> <p><strong>1.15pm:</strong> It's quiet on the Olympics front and the emails front. Having just sat down at the computer, I can tell you that sailors Simon Hiscocks and Chris Draper are second in the mixed 49er after 14 races. Spain lead by nine points. The British duo finished sixth this morning. The pole vault is continuing, but no further sign of Dean Macey yet.</p> <p><strong>1.07pm</strong> Right, it's time for lunch. I'll hand you over to Mike Adamson.</p> <p><strong>1.05pm</strong> One of Dean Macey's close rivals in the decathlon Tom Pappas is in trouble in the polevault. His first attempt ended with him hobbling straight into the mat and he has been studying his left foot with a look of real concern. At the moment he is yet to register a score in this event, and that would mean the end of his competition. He currently lies fifth, one place behind Macey.</p> <p><strong>1pm</strong> Dean Macey easily clears his first vault in the polevault at 4.40m. A bronze medal is not out of the question yet. The javelin starts at 5.30pm, with the 1500m - the final event in the decathlon - taking place at 9.05pm. Come on Dean!</p> <p>\"Obadele Thompson? Pah!\" scoffs Charlie Tinsley. \"What about Anju Bobby George, the Indian long jumper? Her parents were clearly big fans of the Essex darts player.\"</p> <p><strong>12.55pm</strong> I mentioned earlier that Iain Percy and Steve Mitchell had moved up to seventh in the Star class after six races with a third place today. The good news is that there are still five races to go for them to move into the medal places.</p> <p>\"Don't you 'vault' in the pole vault and not jump?\" wonders Robert Kovacs. \"Jumping is in the long or triple jump.\" I suppose you probably do, Robert. I suppose you probably do.</p> <p><strong>12.52pm</strong> Marcus Thorpe has a highly scientific explanation for the Rulon Gardner middle-toe frostbite mystery. \"Frostbite is caused by a combination of extreme cold and poor circulation,\" he begins calmly. \"If you try wiggling your toes, which physically moves least? The middle one. Ergo, most likely to be frost-bitten.\" Brilliant! And so simple. </p> <p><strong>12.50pm</strong> \"<a href=\"http://www.flatbatteries.dsl.pipex.com/games/images/daley2.gif\">This</a> is what Daley meant to an entire generation,\" reckons Jonathan Keith. </p> <p><strong>12.47pm</strong> Things have gone a little quiet in Athens at the moment, so you'll have to make do with this mini-rant from Nigel Wilson.</p> <p>\"Superstars winner and acknowledged fit bloke Brain Hooper presented a 15-minute Channel 4 programme at the end of which he declared water polo the toughest sport he'd ever taken part in. Why don't we get to see any coverage of this (even on interactive)? Just because we invented the game but now play it worse than everyone we taught it to does that mean we shouldn't be entitled to proper coverage (see also tennis, football, and the rest)?\"</p> <p><strong>12.39pm</strong> In the men's star (keelboat), Iain Percy and Steve Mitchell have finished third in race 6, which leaves them seventh overall. But that's just three points behind the Canadians in second place, so there's everything to sail for. Dean Macey is yet to jump in the pole vault.</p> <p>Ed Mack wants to know how the American wrestler Rulon Gardner lost his middle toe to frostbite. \"Wouldn't you expect the flanking toes to have keep it warm and for him to have lost either the big or the (relatively) little toe?\"</p> <p><strong>12.34pm</strong> The pole vault is currently taking place in the decathlon, but no news yet of Dean Macey's progress. You can't get the staff.</p> <p>\"Just to extend James Paterson's point,\" writes Alex Aspinall, \"surely not many other atheletes can claim to have had another athelete named after their sprinting sucess (Obedele Thompson).\"</p> <p><strong>12.29pm</strong> Australia have beaten Japan 1-0 in the semi-finals of the baseball. </p> <p>\"There's also a Daley Thompson House in Notting Hill,\" points out Justin Toland. \"A nice tribute, but where's his knighthood?\" </p> <p><strong>12.24pm</strong> Apparently, I called Christian Malcolm Malcolm Christie earlier. Hilarious though all the jokes are about the Middlesbrough footballer suddenly changing careers, I'd like to put the record straight.</p> <p><strong>12.20pm</strong> \"Perhaps not athletes per say, but 'Sir Tom Finney Way' in Preston is bisected by 'Flintoff Way' upon which a new Sainsburys stands,\" says Dan Musson. \"They do decent pies apparently.\" I think we might be getting off the subject here.</p> <p><strong>12.18pm</strong> \"Daley Thompson came top in a Channel 4 programme about nine years ago to find the greatest ever British Sportsman, beating the likes of Botham, Charlton, Moore etc,\" said Matthew Round. \"As the credits rolled on the last programme my eye caught the credits where it said Executive Consultant: Daley Thompson. No ego whatsoever, that man.\" </p> <p><strong>12.10pm</strong> Sailing, and Simon Hiscocks and Chris Draper have moved to within two points of the overall lead in the 49er class with a narrow win in race 13. The leaders Spain finished eighth.</p> <p>\"Is it me or is there is a self-satisfied air of smugness in all the BBC Sports coverage these days?\" wonders Andrew Goldsby. \"I'm sure they didn't used to be that pleased with themselves all the time and they really don't seem to have learnt the lesson from the way they lost the cricket to Channel 4.\" </p> <p><strong>12.05pm</strong> \"Very few other British athletes can claim to have had the all round success of Daley Thompson,\" pronounces James Peterson, \"and even fewer can claim to have roads named after them. I live a couple of roads down from <a href=\"http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=528808&amp;y=175942&amp;z=1&amp;sv=daley&amp;st=6&amp;tl=Daley+Thompson+Way,+London,+SW8&amp;searchp=newsearch.srf&amp;mapp=newmap.srf\">Daley Thompson way</a>. The more observant will also notice that this leads onto Tessa Sanderson place, metres from my local \"Kelly\" Holmes Place).</p> <p><strong>12.02pm</strong> Just to round up the results so far today from Team GB... Darren Campbell and Malcolm Christie qualify for tonight's second round of the 200m, but Campbell left the stadium rubbing his right leg... But Chris Lambert failed to finish his heat after pulling a hamstring... Rob Newton and Andy Turner didn't make it through to the second round of the 110m hurdles... Dean Macey was fourth going into the pole vault, the eighth event in the decathlon - but he has a lot of work to do to catch up with the USA's Bryan Clay, who currently has a hold on bronze... Ian Wynne (K1 500m), Paul Darby Dowman (K2 1,000m) and Kay Hardy (K1 500m) all qualified for the semi-finals in the canoeing... Nick Skelton is 13th and well-placed to make the final of the individual show-jumping... Robert Smith is 28th... Tony Ally and Mark Shipman are out of the 3m springboard </p> <p><strong>11.48am</strong> \"Can you stop all the gassing and get on with telling us how Deano's doing?\" barks Stephen Torsi. Believe me, Stephen, as soon as I find out, you will be among the first few thousand to know. </p> <p><strong>11.45am</strong> \"Has anyone noticed that the BBC change their commentary for the highlights?\" wonders Daniel Seppings. \"Thus removing the possibility of Colemanballs. The Bryan Clay shot putt from yesterday is a case in point.\"</p> <p><strong>11.42am</strong> Bad news for the Brits in the 3m springboard semi-final. Out of 18 competitors, Tony Ally came 15th and Mark Shipman 18th.</p> <p>\"I don't hear anybody complaining when gymnasts compete in their strongest discipline as well as the the medley (or whatever it's called when they do have a go at all the apparatus in the gym),\" argues Ezra Kirk. \"Also shouldn't the essay be: \"Decathletes. Jack of all trades but master of none, or great all-round competitors. Discus.\" Very nice, Ezra. And in no way lowering the tone. </p> <p><strong>11.39am</strong> No tittering at the back now, but America's reigning Olympic champion in the 120kg Graeco-Roman wrestling Rulon Gardner has won his first two bouts this morning. Gardner has four toes, incidentally, after suffering frostbite when his snowmobile broke down in a Wyoming forest two years ago. Yes, we bring you the human-angle stories too!</p> <p>\"Also, Daley was good enough to compete in team GB's 4x100 relay team,\" points out Harry Wallop.</p> <p><strong>11.32am</strong> Speaking of the individual show-jumping competition, Nick Skelton lies 11th after today's second qualifying round, with Robert Smith back in 28th. </p> <p>\"I recently spent a fortnight in Budapest,\" reveals Gordon Pittendrigh, \"and while no Hungarians I met mentioned the \"Pool of Blood\" final, many of them tried to sell me paprika. How soon they forget.\" Sad, isn't it, Gordon.</p> <p><strong>11.28am</strong> Germany lead the way after the first round of the team show-jumping competition. USA and the Netherlands share second, but a brief scan of the 16 teams reveals that Britain don't actually have one. After much fevered speculation in the office, it is decided that we only have competitors in the individual competition - Nick Skelton and Robert Smith.</p> <p><strong>11.20am</strong> \"Don't you think that events where judges' opinions decide the winner are fundamentally flawed?\" asks Stephen. \"There needs to be some clear winner/loser decider. I recommend merging high diving and greco-roman wrestling or gymnastics and team pursuit cycling. Then we'll know who's boss.\"</p> <p><strong>11.16am</strong> Sarah Hannett is still wincing with the embarrassment of it all. \"The truly cringe-worthy moment of Brendan Foster singing the Batman theme tune as the Hungarian discus gold and bronze winner ran a lap of honour under the Hugarian flag 'cape',\" she says. \"Awful.\"</p> <p><strong>11.12am</strong> Ian Wynne has won Heat 2 in the K-1 500m. Quite where this leaves him overall is anyone's guess.</p> <p>\"Just to chip in on the jack of all trades or good all around athletes debate,\" writes Paul Robson, \"I think I'm right in saying that while the jack of all trades normally applies, in his heyday Daley Thompson's long jump would've won him a medal in the individaul long jump event had he competed (it was certainly no worse that 4th).\" </p> <p><strong>11.05am</strong>The big grudge match in the women's basketball has been won by China, who have beaten Japan 82-63 in the prestigious 9th-10th place play-off.</p> <p>Alex Walter has another amusing quote. \"'That jump was just like the last one - he flew over the bar' - Paul Dickinson commenting on Deano in the high jump last night. It was in fact a replay.\"</p> <p><strong>11.01am</strong> \"Has anyone else noticed that the BBC's gymnastics commentators managed to get their predictions of how the judges would score each performance completely wrong on just about every occasion,\" wonders Dominic Jones. \"Were they trying to push some sort of conspiracy theory on us, or are they perhaps as crap at identifying good gymnastic skills as GB gymnasts are at producing them?\" </p> <p>To be fair, Dominic, it sounds as if everyone got their predictions wrong.</p> <p><strong>10.58am</strong> Bulgaria's Jordan Jovtchev has lost his appeal against the men's rings result after his team claimed that the eventual winner, Dimosthenis Tampakos of Greece, was credited with too high a difficulty rating. But the rules state that you can't query another competitor's score, so Tampakos keeps gold and Jovtchev has to make do with silver.</p> <p>\"For an Olympic Games that everyone said would be a disaster, these are turning out rather well aren't they?\" says Andrew Goldsby. \"We've been witnessing triumph, disaster and controversy. What more could you want?\"</p> <p><strong>10.53am</strong> \"Steve Ovett used to hold an interesting view on the decathlon around the time of Daley Thompson's dominance,\" points out Jezz Nash. \"I believe he described it as 'nine Mickey Mouse events and the 1500 metres'.\" I'd have liked to see Ovett trying the pole vault, Jezz.</p> <p><strong>10.50am</strong> The pole vault in the decathlon starts at around 11am, with Dean Macey needing to jump really rather high to stay in with a chance of what would be one of the most astonishing medals of these Olympics.</p> <p>In the meantime, a brief history lesson from Simon Thomas. \"You're completely missing the historical significance of Russia v Hungry in the water polo,\" he screams. \"Sharpen up, man.\" Did they invade them, or something? </p> <p><strong>10.48am</strong> \"Dean Macey is clearly an amazing all-round athlete,\" writes Alex Marklew. \"After all, he has already picked up a bronze in the three-day eventing, albeit with Pippa Funnell strapped to his back.\" Harsh, Alex. But I'll allow it.</p> <p><strong>10.45am</strong> Here's Jonathan Wood. \"Fave quote of the Olympics so far from John Inverdale on 5 live last night, reflecting on Kelly Holmes' success: 'There are loads of people out there with silver medals; but very few with gold'.\" Made me chuckle too, Jonathan.</p> <p> <strong>10.43am</strong> Dean Macey has clawed his way back to fourth in the decathlon after this morning's discus, and there are now just three events to come. Macey threw 48.34m - the sixth-longest throw - to jump three places after a disappointing 110m hurdles. But Macey still trails third-placed Bryan Clay of the USA by 192 points. A medal could prove tricky. Still, GO DEAN, and all that.</p> <p><strong>10.40am</strong> Ah, controversy. It seems the Russians plan to appeal against many of the decisions made in the gymnastics competition because they reckon the judges were biased against them. There were amazing scenes last night during the horizontal bars when spectators booed the low marks given to Russia's Alexei Nemov, and eventually prompted the judges to up their scores. But it didn't make any difference to Nemov's position and he trailed in fifth. </p> <p><strong>10.32am</strong> Lots of Graeco-Roman wrestling going on. Have searched in vain for Giant Haystacks.</p> <p><strong>10.25am</strong> \"True champions are those who are humble in vistory and gracious in defeat,\" writes Robbie McMillan, inventing words as he goes along. \"Mutola is just a sore loser - what did she expect Kelly to do - take it easy so Mutola could keep winning? I don't think so. Nice one Kelly.\"</p> <p><strong>10.22am</strong> More bad news for the Irish after Sonia O'Sullivan's disappointing run in the 5,000m last night. Paul Brizzel, the man who had to duck out of the way of an errant TV camera during his heat at the European Championships in 2002, finished sixth in the first round of the 200m today. So he's out.</p> <p><strong>10.17am:</strong> They tell me Russia's ladies have beaten Hungary 12-11 in the water polo. I mention this only because things are a little quiet at the moment. But well done the Russians.</p> <p><strong>10.15am:</strong> Well, good morning. Lawrence here. I'm still buzzing with excitement after Kelly Holmes's gold in the 800m last night. Apparently Maria Mutola, her former training partner, has accused Holmes of taking advantage of her injury, which seems like a bit of an odd whinge in an Olympic final. Oh well. Here's Holmes herself. \"It was the hardest race I have run,\" she said. \"My heart just took me to the line.\" And they say romance has no place in sport. </p> <p><strong>10am:</strong> James Coney has set an essay for all you budding sports science students. \"Decathletes. Jack of all trades but master of none, or great all-round competitors. Discuss.\" Now if I had been set that kind of exam question in my English Finals (rather than \"In what ways has lexicography developed over the past century\"), I might have squeezed a first-class degree. My brief opinion, both statements are true. Clearly they are masters of none of the disciplines, otherwise they would be able to compete in the individual events. Their times and distances are down on the individual finals. But, of course, how can someone expect to be a top-class competitor in both the 100m and the 1500m - the two events require different body-types. Yet, of course, to be able to achieve a very good, if not world-class, level at so many events shows they are also great all-round athletes. I must now head off, as this fence I'm sitting on is starting to ache. I leave you in the capable hands of Lawrence Booth.</p> <p><strong>9.45am:</strong> For all you kayaking enthusiasts out there, and I know there are some, Ian Wynne has won his K1 500m first round heat, recording the best time of all the competitors. Lucy Hardy is through to the women's equivalent event, finishing fourth in her heat. </p> <p>It has just been reported that Darren Campbell limped out of the Olympic stadium this morning, and will struggle to be fit for tonight's second round of the 200m. The Manchester man has a tight hamstring.</p> <p><strong>9.30am:</strong> Mixed fortune for Britain's sprinters in the men's 200m. Christian Malcolm looked good as he cruised home in second in his heat, while Darren Campbell struggled to fourth place, just enough to see him into the second round. But Chris Lambert dropped out halfway round the bend, citing a tight hamstring. In Malcolm's heat, Asafa Powell almost caused a sensation by easing up too early on the straight. The Jamaican, favourite for gold, was pushed down to fourth and almost run out of the qualification spots. He would have had only himself to blame, and it would have been most amusing. The other main contenders for the medals all looked typically arrogant, Shaun Crawford looking particularly expressive as he made a point of revealing to his rivals how much better he is than his first round competitors. Justin Gatlin, the 100m champion, also moved serenely into the second round.</p> <p>Andy Turner and Rob Newton, meanwhile, both missed out in the men's 110m hurdles - the days when Britain used to dominate this event with Colin Jackson and Tony Jarrett are long gone. Allen Johnson, who seems to have been around forever, and Anier Garcia, the reigning champion, both won their heats.</p> <p><strong>9.15am:</strong> Good morning everyone, welcome to day 12 (or is it day 13, I lose count?) of the Olympics. It should be a busy day, with Amir Khan boxing for at least a bronze in the men's lightweight category, Chris Newton going for gold in the men's cycling points race final, the men's football semi-finals, and Hicham El Guerrouj looking for that elusive first Olympics title.</p> <p>Dean Macey was up early, before me, and has already competed in two disciplines of the decathlon. His time of 14.56secs in the 110m hurdles saw him drop to seventh from his overnight standing of fourth, 155 points behind Bryan Clay, of America, in the bronze medal position. Macey has since thrown 48.34m in the discus first round, a hearty throw. News of the men's 200m heats and 110m hurdles first round in the next update.</p>",
  "The government must legislate to ban foxhunting before the next election or lose all credibility on the issue, a senior Labour MP warned today. <p>Tony Banks, the former minister and animal rights campaigner, was speaking after reports that \"senior ministers\" are prepared to quit if the prime minister again retreats on promises to outlaw the practice this autumn.</p> <p>As things stand the government has a narrow window of opportunity to get a new anti-hunting bill past opposition in the Lords before a likely election next spring.</p> <p>This morning Mr Banks, a staunch opponent of hunting, warned that a failure to finally pass a bill - first promised by Labour in opposition seven years ago - would make it impossible to go into the election pledging to outlaw the sport.</p> <p>He said: \"If we're not careful this is the final chance - period. The issue has been hanging around now for so long that we'd have no credibility going into a third election promising to outlaw it.</p> <p>\"We are going to have to deal with this in this session [of parliament].\"</p> <p>The identities of the ministers who, according to today's Times, would quit as a point of principle over the failure to legislate remain a mystery, but Labour backbenchers are increasingly angry and frustrated with the government over the issue.</p> <p><b>Growing frustration</b><br></p> <p>After seven years of delays and defeat in enacting legislation, there is speculation in Westminster that the government might force a new bill through the Commons in one day during the two-week period at the beginning of September, before the party conference season.</p> <p>It would then most likely be defeated in the Lords, where the government does not have a majority, but - because that would be the second Lords defeat in successive sessions of parliament - the government could then force the measure through using the Parliament Act, whereby the Commons can overrule peers.</p> <p>According to arcane parliamentary procedure, as long as the defeat in the Lords came at least 30 days before the end of the parliamentary session, it could then be introduced via the Parliament Act. The current session of parliament is expected to end in mid-November, allowing the government, if it wishes, to go into the next election having enacted a hunting ban.</p> <p>Such a move would act as a sop to Labour backbenchers disgruntled with the direction of the prime minister, since banning foxhunting is a totemic issue among many MPs.</p> <p>A sign, albeit discreet, that this may be the case came before the summer recess, when the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, only gave out parliamentary business for the first week in September, leaving conspiracy-minded MPs convinced that the bill could be introduced in one day in the second week, most likely September 14.</p> <p>Mr Hain himself has come out strongly against hunting, telling MPs at the final business questions of parliament that \"this barbaric practice has to be ended\".</p> <p>More explicitly, he told another MP: \"'This is what the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs want and undoubtedly there is a large majority of the country that expects this parliament to do so and to do so before the general election.\"</p> <p>He hinted to MPs: \"I think you will be encouraged when I do make the announcement in the way we intend to pursue this.\"</p> <p>Before the summer recess, more than 250 MPs signed an early day motion demanding a ban.</p> <p>The government's last attempt to tackle the controversial issue in July 2003 saw it introduce a bill which would have allowed some licensed foxhunting to continue. Labour MPs voted to turn this into a total ban, after five hours of intense Commons debate, by 362 votes to 154.</p> <p>But the amended bill was blocked by the Lords in October as peers voted in favour of a licensing regime for foxhunting, stag hunting and hare coursing, sending the bill back to the Commons where it ran out of time.</p>",
  "One of France's ex-terrorists is missing. Cesare Battisti, the Italian ex-guerrilla turned thriller writer and pin-up of the far left who was granted asylum by a sympathetic Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in 1985 after a court in Rome handed down a life sentence in his absence, has apparently fled. <p>The precise nature of Battisti's revolutionary activities has never been entirely clear. Born in 1954, the biography on his website records that he joined an organisation called Armed Proletarians for Communism in 1976 after various run-ins with the police. In 1979, he fell foul of what he describes as a \"vast anti-terrorist operation\" and was jailed.</p> <p>Two years later, Battisti escaped - first to France and then to Mexico, where he worked as a journalist before returning to Paris. Mr Mitterrand allowed him to stay on condition that he renounced all terrorist activities and did not attempt to flee.</p> <p>Several critically acclaimed thrillers followed, including the semi-autobiographical The Last Bullets. In 1993, an Italian court found Battisti guilty in his absence of the murders of a prison guard, a policeman, and a neo-fascist militant.</p> <p>But it was not until February of this year that the French government - keen to avoid the charge that it was soft on terrorists - finally bowed to pressure from Rome and arrested him.</p> <p>Much to the disgust of his supporters, a French court subsequently ruled that he could be extradited to Italy. His lawyers claim the only evidence against him was supplied by turncoats and that at least one of them was tortured during the trial.</p> <p>Fred Vargas, another thriller writer, promptly rushed out a book protesting his innocence, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur Cesare Battisti. The man himself insisted in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche earlier this month that he had never killed anyone. The French left, meanwhile, urged President Jacques Chirac not to betray a man to whom his predecessor had granted asylum.</p> <p>Battisti's lawyers accused the government of breaching the European convention of human rights in accepting the verdict of the Italian court.</p> <p>It was to no avail. Faced with an intransigent government and the prospect of spending the rest of his life in jail without a retrial, Battisti failed to sign in at the local police station last Saturday for his weekly check.</p> <p>\"If he has fled, which I can only suppose he has, he is entitled to defend himself,\" Ms Vargas told Lib\u00e9ration today. \"I've seen the psychological damage that the media's campaign against him has done.\"</p> <p>\"He realised that the separation of power no longer exists, that Chirac and Berlusconi had made up their minds to condemn him,\" she added. \"He was becoming more and more fragile.\" She told France Inter radio she was afraid he would harm himself.</p> <p>There was plenty of sympathy for the fugitive today among those who sympathised with his armed struggle against the Italian state. \"He was trapped,\" a communist senator told Lib\u00e9ration. \"There was no possibility of a retrial in Italy.\"</p> <p>\"He chose life, and I'm happy for him,\" another ex-member of the Red Brigades, Oreste Scalzone, told the paper.</p> <p>The Italian government was less sanguine at the news that France had allowed Battisti to get away. Roberto Castelli, a minister in the Italian government, praised the French courts for ordering his extradition this morning but attacked French \"leftwing intellectuals\" who, he said, had more sympathy for terrorists than their victims.</p>",
  "Lida Rodriguez-Taseff, a corporate lawyer and a former president of the Miami chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, vividly remembers the moment she became an election reform activist. It was on September 10 2002, when she saw yet another election in south Florida go unfathomably awry - this time a primary election, the first vote in which her county, Miami-Dade, and several neighbouring counties would use electronic voting machines at the polls. <p>\"It was jarring,\" she recalls. The poll workers didn't know how to run the new touch-screen machines. The voters didn't know how to vote on the machines. Some of the systems didn't work at all; they displayed incorrect selections, froze up, acted generally odd. \"What moved me to action was seeing all these people - elderly black folks standing in line for hours without being able to vote, fanning themselves in the hot sun, waiting for the machines to start working so they could get their chance,\" Rodriguez-Taseff says. \"And then, seeing the people coming out of the polls with their eyes dazed over, shocked and amazed by what had happened. They couldn't understand why when they pressed a button next to one candidate, the machine brought up another candidate's name.\" </p> <p>Accounts of the perils of electronic voting systems are nothing new. In the last couple of years, it seems we've all heard stories like Rodriguez-Taseff's - tales of machines breaking down during elections, of systems displaying erroneous selections, of machines behaving badly. When computer security experts have examined some of the voting machines now widely in use, they've discovered enormous security problems. In January, for instance, a team at RABA Technologies, a computer consulting firm in Maryland, managed to devise a half-dozen ways of compromising the votes in touch-screen machines manufactured by Diebold, which produces the systems to be used in Maryland and Georgia this year. (A PDF file of their report can be found <a href=\"http://www.raba.com/press/TA_Report_AccuVote.pdf\">here</a>.) Voter confidence cannot be helped by the suspicion that some voting machine firms have close relationships with certain politicians. Diebold's CEO is famous online for declaring, in his role as a major Bush-Cheney fundraiser, that he's \"committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year\". </p> <p>According to the political consulting firm Election Data Services, on election day this year about 29% of the registered voters in the nation - more than 45 million people - will find electronic touch-screen systems at their polling places. To computer scientists, the only way to secure these machines is to have them print out \"verifiable\" paper ballots - a paper ballot that a voter accepts or rejects as his accurate vote, and which is then counted in the case of a contested election. Such a system will only be available this year for the one-half of 1% of voters in Nevada. The rest of us will cast our electronic votes with a kind of leap of faith. We'll have no way of knowing what the machine has actually recorded, and we'll be forced to trust that the system (the officials, the voting company, the procedures, everyone and everything involved in the race) has done everything fairly. We have no choice, really, but to trust the system. </p> <p>Still, two years after witnessing that Florida debacle, Rodriguez-Taseff, who founded and now heads the Miami-Dade Reform Coalition, a non-partisan citizen's group dedicated to fixing elections in a county where elections seem eternally unfixable, remains deeply worried about the electronic systems that will be used at her polls this year. But she says that it's too late, too costly and probably not even technically feasible to configure voting machines to print the kind of verifiable ballots that computer scientists have called for, at least for this election. That kind of system, untested and unproven in any real race, \"lives in outer space\", Rodriguez-Taseff says bluntly. </p> <p>Rodriguez-Taseff chief worries surround the far more pragmatic issues of voting procedures and voting practices we'll have to deal with in electronic polling places this year. She fears that polls won't open on time, and that voters won't know how to use the machines, and that officials won't know how to help voters when the machines (inevitably) screw up. She's also concerned that, in the event of irregularities, elections laws in Florida won't allow a thorough examination of the machines to see what's gone wrong. The machines in her state are capable of printing out paper \"ballot images\" of each vote after the election; these ballot images aren't quite the same thing as the voter-verified paper trail that computer scientists have been calling for, but they would constitute some kind of paper record of every voter's choices, and Rodriguez-Taseff believes they could prove useful if there are questions about an election's accuracy. Florida's election rules, however, specifically prohibit manually recounting these ballot images, a situation that Rodriguez-Taseff says will cast even more doubt on election results. </p> <p>She is also concerned that voters who've heard about the problems with electronic voting machines will disenfranchise themselves. In a recent poll of Florida voters conducted by Quinnipiac University, more than half of the people surveyed reported being less than fully confident that their votes would be counted at all during the upcoming election. The numbers were higher when broken out for minorities and Democrats in the state. About 16% of those surveyed said they planned to vote by absentee ballot, and half of them said they were choosing the absentee route because they didn't trust the voting machines. </p> <p>Rodriguez-Taseff blames political parties - specifically Democrats trying to court minority voters in Florida - for this scepticism. She says the parties aren't doing enough to educate voters about what they'll see at the polls this year. Instead of being honest with voters about both the advantages and disadvantages of electronic voting, politicians are trying to paper over the problems, or to urge a quick-fix - not especially good - alternative: absentee voting. </p> <p>But other voting experts charge that it's not the Democrats' or the Republicans' fault that people don't trust the election system - it is, instead, the fault of activists who've been constantly criticising the voting machines for the past two years. \"The conversation the way they've been framing it is all going to make people believe that they shouldn't vote,\" says Ted Selker, a professor at MIT who co-directs the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, which produced a landmark study examining how voting technology performed in the 2000 election. He says that electronic voting critics have forced the electorate to become much more cynical and jaded about elections and especially about the integrity of elections officials. </p> <p>And in an election this tight, is such scepticism something that political parties - especially Democrats - want or need? Most touch-screen machines in south Florida were introduced, after all, by Democratic officials who were horrified at the rate of disenfranchisement of minorities in the 2000 presidential vote; the machines were supposed to make voters come back to the polls, not keep them away. Clearly, though, either the machines, or the controversy surrounding the machines, is making people scared. </p> <p>What if all the activism only succeeds in keeping people away from the polls on election day? Just a few weeks after Florida's 2002 primary, when Salon first reported on the flawed machines and on some computer experts' concerns about the security and accuracy of electronic voting systems, just about everyone we spoke to in the election community told us not to worry. What happened in Florida's primary was caused by ill-prepared poll workers, not buggy machines, elections officials and voting companies said, and they maintained (and still maintain) that no votes were lost. It was said that computer scientists who fretted about electronic voting machines that aren't backed up by a \"paper trail\" were naive, and they didn't understand the rigorous security procedures that occur in real elections; people who suggested that we shouldn't trust our democracy to private firms were scoffed at, labelled conspiracy theorists. </p> <p>Over the course of a couple of years, though, calls by elections officials and voting companies for us to remain unworried became almost comically blind to the problems at hand. There have been enough voting machine failures, scandals and expos\u00e9s in that time to make any concerned citizen weep. These days, nobody can seriously call the critics of such systems naive conspiracy theorists. Thanks to their efforts, we now know that at voting firms such as Diebold, employees don't seem to take security very seriously, as internal documents from the firm seem to suggest; that executives at some companies have suspiciously close relationships with elected officials; and that, despite assurances from elections officials, when you vote on an electronic machine, you might never know what the system has done with your choice. </p> <p>No longer are the activists considered kooks and paranoids, and their fears, backed up by numerous studies pointing out flaws in some electronic voting machines, have thoroughly permeated the mainstream media. Magazines as diverse as the Nation, Vanity Fair and Hustler have devoted considerable space to the issue. In January, the New York Times inaugurated a special editorial page section aimed at Making Votes Count, and Paul Krugman routinely uses his column to warn of the dangers of paperless electronic voting. When Rodriguez-Taseff's Miami-Dade Reform Coalition recently discovered that the county had lost all of its electronic records from the 2002 election, the news didn't break online, in a techie blog or underground discussion site, as it might have a year or two ago. Instead, the story landed on the front page of the Times. </p> <p>The coverage has certainly helped convince the public, as well as elections officials, of the dangers of electronic systems. Officials in California, for instance, have mandated that electronic systems include verifiable paper ballots by 2006, and Congress is mulling over legislation to require such machines nationally. David Dill, the Stanford computer scientist who's done much to line up technologists against paperless electronic voting systems, says that he's exceedingly pleased with what critics of electronic voting machines have accomplished so far. When, in early 2003, Dill began asking computer scientists to sign a petition calling for verifiable voting systems - that is, systems that produce some kind of human-readable physical evidence of a person's vote - he didn't think he'd be able to convince entire states to change their rules. </p> <p>But, in the face of so much anti-e-voting rhetoric, are voters becoming unreasonably scared or suspicious of elections? They might be. While it's undeniable that Dill and other critics of electronic voting systems have sparked much-needed discussion and action to fix some of the glaring problems with electronic machines, experts like Selker worry the hype is unnecessarily scaring voters. Selker points out that in 2000, most of the votes that were lost because of equipment malfunction were caused by faulty ballot design (remember the \"butterfly ballot\"?), not faulty machines, and that by far the largest number of votes (several million) lost could be blamed on bad voter registration procedures. These problems should be fixed before we spend money on paper trails for touch-screen machines, Selker says. </p> <p>While he understands people's trepidation about voting on a system that doesn't have a paper trail, Selker insists that rigorous testing can detect malicious code in paperless voting systems. He recommends, for instance, that elections officials conduct \"parallel testing\" on voting machines - on election day, they would randomly visit precincts and pull certain machines out of service for the day, then subject those machines to a battery of tests. If those randomly selected machines are found to record and tabulate votes accurately, you can be reasonably sure that the other machines are doing the same thing. (Officials in California are expected to conduct parallel testing on election day, as will some officials in electronic voting counties scattered all over the nation. In Maryland, where the choice to go to Diebold machines has sparked several security reviews and a lawsuit calling on a court to prevent the state from using the system, officials are considering using the parallel testing, said Linda Lamone, the administrator of Maryland's board of elections.) With such measures in place, Selker says, people can be confident that the electronic machines are working properly. \"It'd be terrible if the reason we didn't have a great election is because Americans acted like voters in a third world country\" and didn't trust what happened at the polling place, he says. </p> <p>David Dill, for his part, insists that it was never his intention to cause people to stay away from the polls, and he says he always tries to let people know that the problems with voting machines are no excuse not to vote. \"People have to vote,\" he says. \"I'm not sure how to get that message across. I wouldn't be going to all this trouble to make sure we have a trustworthy election system if I didn't respect the importance of voting.\" He also emphasises that \"we're not talking about a proven conspiracy to steal the election with electronic voting. I'm sure that there'll be some people saying such things, but what I've been saying all along is we should pick the best technology we have available and use that\". </p> <p>There is something of an inconsistency to what Dill says, however. On the one hand, he's insisting that elections can't be trusted unless they're conducted on equipment that produces some kind of verifiable paper trail. At the same time, he's telling voters that they should probably go ahead and vote on machines that don't produce such a trail, machines that he says can't be trusted. Now, most people will probably disregard this inconsistency and, even if they agree with Dill that the machines are flawed, they'll still go ahead and vote. As Dill says, this year's election is far too important to miss out on. But there are probably a fair number of people who are on the fence about voting to begin with - young people, say, or certain minorities, or members of other groups that tend to vote in low numbers, possibly because they don't think voting will make any real difference to their lives. Dill's suggestion that the voting system is not trustworthy just adds another reason for them to doubt the importance of voting - and for how many people will it be the deciding factor, the final straw keeping them home on election day? </p> <p>Some Democrats are, understandably, nervous about this idea. Dill says that he's heard from party officials who tell him privately that they support him, but that they couldn't support the cause publicly for fear that it will turn voters away. In Florida, the party is giving voters mixed signals about what they should do. It won't say that the machines are buggy, or that people shouldn't trust them. Yet it has also supported a call for a paper trail. When asked about the party's position, Allie Merzer, a spokeswoman for the Florida Democratic party, says, \"We advocate for any system that increases voter confidence. All voters should have the right to have their vote counted.\" Merzer says that \"in some instances\" people have \"valid\" concerns about electronic voting machines. People who are concerned should vote using other methods, she suggests - absentee ballots or early voting. In light of people's concerns, the party is \"ramping up\" its effort to sign people up for absentee ballots, Merzer says. </p> <p>\"Stupid Democrats - with Democrats as dumb as this who needs Republicans?\" counters Lida Rodriguez-Taseff. \"They're running around afraid of their own shadows, not talking about the problems with the voting machines, thinking they can lie and manipulate the African-American community into voting for them.\" </p> <p>Instead of being mealy-mouthed about the situation, Rodriguez-Taseff would like the Democrats to directly acknowledge and make clear to voters the problems associated with electronic machines. Only when it does this will the party be able to fix the problems, she says. And she thinks that a direct approach will bring more voters to the polls: \"They should reach deep into the history of this situation,\" she says. \"They really should be saying, 'Look, the lynch mob didn't scare you away from voting. Poll taxes didn't scare you away. Literacy tests didn't scare you away. Are you going to let a little voting machine scare you away?' Voting is a sign of defiance and courage. Voting at a voting machine even when the voting machine doesn't work is a sign of courage. But instead, they're choosing to lie to people. 'No, the lynch mob is not outside.' 'Oh yeah, your vote will be counted - just vote for us.' People aren't stupid. And that's why people aren't going to go to the polls, because they're being lied to.\" </p> <p>Rodriguez-Taseff also takes issue with the Democrats' suggestion that people should vote using absentee ballots instead of going to the polls. Absentee ballots are not known to be any safer than electronic voting systems. Yes, there's a paper ballot - but it can easily be thrown away, lost, misfiled, damaged, never counted, or be subjected to any number of other harms, whether intentional or accidental. Of course, there are security precautions to prevent these things; but if you're the sort of person who is wary about the security precautions meant to prevent electronic vote fraud, why wouldn't you be similarly wary of the precautions meant to prevent absentee-ballot vote fraud? </p> <p>Rodriguez-Taseff says that she doesn't intend to vote absentee. With all that can go wrong with such a ballot, she'd prefer to take her chances with the computer. Ted Selker of MIT says the same thing. Indeed, Selker recounts a time he witnessed an incident of absentee ballot tampering in his own voting precinct in Massachusetts. After he cast his vote on one election day, he noticed a woman (probably an elections official or poll worker) sitting to the side, looking over a stack of ballots. He asked her what she was doing. \"I'm checking the absentee ballots,\" the woman said, explaining that she was making sure that they were in good enough condition to be filed into the ballot reader. Selker asked her if she'd found any problems. \"So she tells me, 'One of them couldn't be read, so I looked at it and I found a mark that wasn't right and I erased it,'\" Selker says. \"So you see, she changed somebody's ballot without anyone else's permission, on her own. And she admitted it to me. That's what I think about absentee ballots.\"</p> <p>David Dill's home precinct in California uses a paper-based optical scan voting system, not an electronic touch-screen. If it did use a touch-screen, would he vote absentee? Dill is aware of the problems with absentee ballots, and choosing between absentee voting and paperless touch-screen voting would be especially difficult, he says. In the end, though, Dill says that he would probably take his chances with the absentee ballot. Rebecca Mercuri, the computer scientist who first developed the idea of a verified paper ballot and is quite sceptical of any machines that lack such a system, says that she, too, would vote absentee instead of on a touch-screen. </p> <p>One of the few political groups that seems to have no deep division or concern about how people should vote in the upcoming election is the Republican party. At both national and local levels, the GOP is consistent about what people should do - they should go to the polls and vote, and they should trust their touch-screens. It is true that in July, the Florida Republicans sent some voters a flier urging them to register for absentee ballots. \"The liberal Democrats have already begun their attacks and the new electronic voting machines do not have a paper ballot to verify your vote in case of a recount,\" said the flier, which featured a picture of President Bush. \"Make sure your vote counts. Order your absentee ballot today.\" But the party immediately repudiated that message. Everything else that Republican officials - including Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Glenda Hood, the Republican secretary of state - have said indicates a deep trust in the elections systems as they are. </p> <p>\"That flier most definitely caused confusion,\" says Joseph Agostini, a spokesman for the Republican party of Florida. He says that the person responsible for that confusion has \"learned the hard way\" what the Florida Republicans actually think about electronic voting. \"It's something we regret that went out, and we've taken steps to make sure that this misunderstanding doesn't occur again,\" Agostini says. \"Let me say without any uncertainty that we the Republican party have complete confidence in the Florida election system and its accuracy. Whether it's opti-scan or touch-screen by Diebold, we have no doubts that the election will run smoothly.\" </p> <p>If you're concerned with the security of electronic voting systems but you decide to vote on such a machine anyway, you can perhaps rest a bit easier this year, as the controversy surrounding the machines has already led to many extra security safeguards protecting the systems. In large part due to the activists' complaints over the lack of a paper trail, some of the most ill-regarded machines and manufacturers have been subjected to punishing scrutiny. Diebold's machines, for instance, have been thoroughly inspected by several computer researchers, and while many of the researchers found significant problems with the machines, it is at least comforting to know that elections officials and the company made some improvements to the systems. In Maryland, for example, the state and Diebold have implemented many of the safeguards proposed by RABA, a computer firm that found significant vulnerabilities in the Diebold system earlier this year. Lamone says that while she has not enjoyed being the subject of intense criticism over her decision to use Diebold's machines, \"I like the opportunity to make things better.\" </p> <p>Facing similar pressures from critics of electronic voting systems, Nevada secretary of state Dean Heller decided last December to make his state the first in the nation to use paper-equipped touch-screen systems. The machines he chose are manufactured by Sequoia Voting Systems, and for the most part they work exactly how proponents of such systems have said all touch-screen systems should work: when a voter steps up to the system and casts a ballot on the touch-screen machine, a printer attached to the machine produces a ballot for the voter to review. (The ballot is printed under a glass screen in order to prevent the voter from walking off with it.) After the voter reviews this paper ballot, he or she can either accept or reject it on the touch-screen; either way, the ballot scrolls away into a locked compartment, and it's then considered the voter's official ballot, trumping whatever electronic ballot the touch-screen machine has stored. In the event that a recount is needed, the paper ballot tape would be counted by hand, and that count would become the ultimate election result, according to Alfie Charles, a spokesman for Sequoia. </p> <p>David Dill and Rebecca Mercuri say they're hopeful that the Nevada test will go well, but both say they think there'll probably be some mishaps in the state, as there always are in such things. \"I do not want the future of the paper-trail movement to be judged on how the machines do in Nevada,\" Dill says, though he concedes that this will probably happen. If the election in Nevada goes badly, people on the other side of the paper-trail debate will surely point to the race as proof that paper-trail systems can't work. </p> <p>And, who knows, maybe they'd be right. Indeed, Mercuri says that she's been thinking for some time that even electronic machines equipped with a paper trail \"are probably not the best way to vote,\" because \"the touch-screen puts something between the voter and the actual construction of their ballots\". For most able-bodied voters, both Mercuri and Dill say, fill-in-the-bubble optical-scan paper ballots are probably the best way to vote. </p> <p>Many groups and both political parties plan to monitor polling places this year, and, given the scrutiny they'll face, you can be sure that any irregularity, no matter how small, will be taken very seriously by officials. Verified Voting, David Dill's group, is calling for technically inclined people to volunteer to monitor precincts across the nation. Verified Voting is also creating a web-based national error-reporting system, a central clearinghouse for people to report everything that goes wrong on election day; this will allow the group to spot when similar problems occur in different locations, say, or to keep track of a specific sort of glitch, giving activists a fuller picture of what happens on election day. </p> <p>In Maryland, Linda Schade, the activist who has sued the state to prevent the Diebold machines from being used in November, says that in the event her suit is unsuccessful, she and her fellow Diebold critics will closely scrutinise what happens on November 2. \"I want to have a handful of people at every precinct dedicated to helping people, making sure they know what's going on, that all races are on the ballots, that voters go in with the information they need, and that there are people on hand when there are problems,\" she says. </p> <p>Schade says she hopes everything goes well. But what if it doesn't? What if, for example, there's an unexpected result - what if Maryland, which looks sure to choose Kerry, goes for Bush? Will anyone trust the machines? </p> <p>In the end, that's the only real test of a voting system. Do people believe what it says, even when what it says seems unbelievable? \"If we wake up the next day and Maryland has gone for Bush ... \" Schade says, and her voice trails off. There's nothing more to say. The truth is, nobody really knows what will happen then. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Farhad Manjoo is a staff writer for Salon Technology &amp; Business.</p> <p>This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited.<br> \u00a9 Salon.com 2004<br> Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/\">salon.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Teachers today welcomed the slight improvement of test results for seven, 11 and 14-year-olds, but urged the government to drop its \"testing, tables and targets\" regime.</p> <p>\"The testing engine has run out of steam,\" said Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers.</p> <p>The national test results, published today, showed a 1% to 2% improvement across the board in English, maths and science, apart from at 14, where the number of pupils reaching the expected grade dipped by 2%.</p> <p>The schools standards minister, David Miliband, said he was pleased with the results, claiming they had broken the three-year \"plateau\" of no improvement. Prior to that there had been a rapid improvement for four years since Labour came to power, bringing with it new literacy and numeracy strategies. </p> <p>But the improvements still fall short of many of the targets set for schools in 1998, when David Blunkett was education secretary. Primary schools have missed not only their targets for this year, but have still not achieved those set for 2002. At least 85% of pupils should be leaving primary school with the required levels of achievement in maths and English by 2006, but with an eight-point gap to close that now looks unlikely. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat education spokesman, Phil Willis, called on the government to honour the promise made by Mr Blunkett in 1998 to resign if the targets were missed. \"Seven years later those targets seem just as remote,\" he said. </p> <p>He attacked the Labour minister's reaction today, saying: \"David Miliband's complacency hides a stark fact that this government's desire to control school standards from the centre has miserably failed.\"</p> <p>Teaching organisations congratulated teachers and pupils for their work, but said the government should follow the example of the Welsh assembly, which earlier this year dropped the national testing and target setting regime. </p> <p>Mary Bousted said: \"Congratulations to both pupils and their teachers on their efforts - but congratulations come with a health warning. Test results can't be relied upon alone - they're subject to variation and only represent part of a learner's achievement.</p> <p>\"The government must face facts: testing by itself is no longer driving up standards. The testing engine has run out of steam.\"</p> <p>The general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, John Dunford, said schools were being \"tested to destruction\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, Steve Sinnott, said the government's persistence with targets meant it had \"shot itself in the foot\".</p> <p>\"Inevitably those hostile to the success of our primary schools point to the fact that the government's original targets have not been achieved rather than to the continuing improvement in pupil performance.</p> <p>\"The question still has to be asked: why is the government continuing to impose these uninformative and damaging tests on pupils in England? Teachers regard these tests as disruptive of children's education, taking up an unreasonable amount of time and placing an additional workload on teachers without benefit to pupils, parents or teachers. </p> <p>\"The government should follow the example of Wales and get rid of these educationally unsound tests, performance tables and crude national targets.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year the Welsh assembly announced that it planned to do away with national testing, relying instead on more teacher assessment of children's progress. Westminster was urged to follow suit. Scotland has already dropped the tests. </p> <p>The education secretary, Charles Clarke, has insisted that he will stand by the government's policy on national testing, but there are some indications that other options are being considered. Some 5,000 primary schools in England have been piloting teacher-led test assessment. An independent comparative study of whether this has worked is expected later this year.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there were concerns about the 2% drop in the number of 14-year-olds reaching the correct level in science, which Mr Miliband said was \"unexpected\". This follows concerns about the failing number of students opting to study some science subjects - physics, chemistry and engineering - at university. </p> <p>Dr Peter Cotgreave, director of the campaigning group Save British Science, said it was \"very worrying\". </p> <p>\"There is a really serious shortage of science teachers at secondary school. We can't expect to enthuse kids and get them through their tests if we haven't got people who know and enthuse about the subject themselves.\"</p>",
  "In the ocean-fed air and mild August sunshine of America's most beautiful city, optimism flows easy. But the real mood-lift these past few days was in the windowless conference rooms of two downtown mega-hotels. More than 5,000 American sociologists, plus a few foreign scholars, held their largest and, many said, most vibrant annual convention for years. <p>Bush and Kerry were campaigning through nearby states. Their soundbites were rarely mentioned, but the lack of serious debate is one reason for US sociology's new political engagement after decades of quiet since the 60s. </p> <p>The profession's centre of gravity is moving left. There is a drive to inject ethical standards into the analysis of what most agree is a US society becoming increasingly polarised beneath its veneer of shared consumerism. </p> <p>Above all, sociologists are starting to challenge the intellectual stranglehold of American economists who have managed to get the neo-liberal model of competitive individualism and corporate globalisation to dominate public discourse and policy-making for the past 20 years. </p> <p>Words like \"empire\" and \"inequality\" popped up frequently at this conference after their post-Vietnam war dormancy. New phrases like \"the corporate state\" and \"global apartheid\" appeared. </p> <p>Half the world's PhDs in sociology are taken at American universities. The US has 13,000 career sociologists, a potential for extraordinary intellectual hegemony. They flexed their muscles last year, becoming the only US professional association to oppose the invasion of Iraq. A few unions denounced the war and even the normally conservative trade union federation, the AFL-CIO, passed a mildly worded vote of criticism. But with the exception of the sociologists, America's professions were coy about raising their collective voice. </p> <p>It was no accident that this year's conference theme was \"public sociologies\". It was chosen by the American Sociological Association's president, Michael Burawoy, a modest Mancunian ethnographer and sociologist who emigrated in the 70s. He distinguishes public sociology from professional sociology, which he describes as work aimed primarily for academic journals and peer review - \"solving puzzles\". It also differs from policy sociology, which is \"solving problems\" for mainly government or business. </p> <p>Public sociology, by contrast, is a conversation with society about values. Burawoy is careful to argue that it does not have a single orientation since a third of the sociologists who voted rejected the anti-war motion. He also insists that the three types - professional, policy and public - are inter-dependent. Without rigorous scholarly standards no public sociology will be taken seriously. </p> <p>Most controversially, Burawoy wants to \"provincialise\" American sociology. This may sound odd since US intellectual life has long been scarred by insularity. Burawoy means his slogan provocatively. The famous \"end of history\" claim that US liberal democracy and market capitalism were the only models left was a sign, in his view, that many Americans were trying to universalise the particular. They should realise their culture is not always preferred else where. To make the point, he invited high-profile foreigners like Arundhati Roy, the anti-globalisation campaigner, and Mary Robinson, a former UN human rights commissioner. </p> <p>Sociologists' relations with the state vary in time and place. The South Africans and east Europeans present were ex-dissidents who described how the advent of democratic and legitimate governments in their countries had brought new problems. Debate narrowed, intellectuals were less in demand and disappointment with rising social inequality and the new governments' economic policies was leading to public apathy. </p> <p>Jacklyn Cock, author of a path-breaking exposure of the plight of domestic workers in South Africa, called on sociologists to stand in solidarity with the new social movements. But she warned against romanticising civil society in the struggle against globalisation's injustices. \"The real issue of our time is how to reinvent the state,\" she said. </p> <p>Her point applies with greatest force in the US. Behind the rhetoric of small government, the US has created a monster state where political, economic and media power is dominated by corporations. America's political scientists ought to be taking the leading role in analysing this distortion of democracy but, according to their sociology rivals, their profession is in a conservative phase. It churns out graduates for the foreign service rather than critics who want to reform the system. Sociologists have to move alone. </p> <p>Four days in California are not going to change the world. But it was hard not to feel that something big is stirring in US academic life. The dominance of Reaganomics is under serious intellectual challenge. Clinton's third way is rejected as neoliberalism in a different guise - welfare-cutting, support for the out-sourcing of US jobs and unfair \"free\" trade. </p> <p>The foreign subjects of America's global empire have been restless for years. Now some of the sharpest minds are raising questions. Even if John Kerry wins control of the White House, the rebellion is unlikely to stop. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>\"GreatBritainGreatBritainGreatBritain! T-rarrty!\" exclaimed the elderly Jamaican lady seated in row 12. Clutching a triumvirate of flags - Jamaican, British and Greek - she had been flashing her gold teeth and waving her nationalities around for most of the evening. But, as for most of us, it was the 800m women's final that really got to her.</p> <p>\"Aww Kelly,\" she said, patting her gold fingernails to her breast with a proud smile. Kelly Holmes: the first British woman to win the 800m Olympic gold medal since Ann Packer in 1964; the first British woman to win Olympic gold on the track since Sally Gunnell in 1992; the first British gold athletics medal at this year's Games. And she did it in her usual inimitable style.</p> <p>Loping at the back for the first 400m, Holmes began a slow acceleration in the second lap. Over the final 300m she ran the long way round, past the shoulder of her training partner Maria Mutola before finally breaking for the front in the 100m straight. It was a close finish, Mutola just missing out on the medals as old rival Jolanda Ceplak stole second and the Moroccan Hasna Benhassi took third. The spectacle of such a race had bewitched the crowd; the tannoy announced that a replay would be shown on the large screens.</p> <p>Our row 12 lady beamed and stuck a Union Jack in the face of a nearby Dominican Republic supporter, who snorted with derision and commented on her divided loyalties. But Row 12's loyalties were more ubiquitous than divided. Caught up in the much talked-about spirit of the Games, Row 12 was all about exuberance and celebration, not national borders and control points.</p> <p>The Olympic stadium follows a rise-and-fall pattern of stillness and intense activity. Jumpers and sprinters burst forward to riotous applause from the crowd, the home fans chanting \"Hellas! Hellas!\". Medal ceremonies call for silence and reflection as national anthems squeak from the loudspeakers, and the crowd is strangely quiet. \"Why no-one singing it?\" hissed Row 12 to her daughter. She was talking about the American national anthem, played for the 100m gold medallist Justin Gatlin, for which several conscientious objectors had refused to stand. An eerie silence floated over the stadium as the crowd paused to reflect upon the intimations of an American victory: drug manufacturing laboratories in California, war in Iraq, victims of 9/11, the sound of the thought processes almost tangible.</p> <p>Then, a rising cheer and onto the next event: the men's 400m final; the line up dominated by American and Jamaican athletes, all black bar one - Jeremy Wariner of the USA . Another kid exploding onto the scene, seemingly from nowhere; 44.00 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year, Wariner took the track and the gold medal by storm. The droning chords of \"Shaft\" and then Springsteen's \"Born in the USA\" filtered through the tannoy and there followed a period of collective murmuring: where had this kid come from?</p> <p>The women's triple jump medal ceremony also brought confusion, along with celebration, the powerful Francoise Mbango Etone taking centre podium to claim gold. \"Trevor McDonald!\" exclaimed row 12, \"Trevor Trevor! It's Trevor McDonald!\" as Lamine Diack IOC representative for Senegal, not the ITV news presenter, stepped forward for the presentation. \"Oh it not Trevor\" she sighed and sat back in her seat, \"Cha! I really thought it was.\"</p> <p>As though in response to her intense disappointment, the crowd began to slip away. Morphing back through the coils of the aluminium walkways, they packed themselves back into the metros and began the long return journey home.</p>",
  "<p>Echoes of Grieg's incidental music float briefly across the night air. That, however, is the only concession to 19th-century romanticism in Peter Zadek's witty, ironic, loudly applauded Berliner Ensemble production of Ibsen's epic work - a version that sees Peer as a contemporary Everyman and Ibsen's play as a prophetic forerunner of modern drama. </p> <p>Zadek keeps the house lights on throughout, which gives us every chance to analyse Uwe Bohm's mercurial hero. What comes across is Peer's boundless mix of sensuality and self-delusion. He treats all women - even his mother Aase - as potential sex-objects waiting to be flung across his shoulder in a fireman's lift. He adopts the philosophy of \"look after number one\" as the law of life. And, in Karl Kneidl's design, he ends up in a portable urban snack-bar peeling an onion that, like himself, has no core. Bohm not only holds the evening together with his energy but reminds us that Peer's enslavement to selfhood is the curse of modern man. </p> <p>Zadek's fleet production also proves that Ibsen in 1867 anticipated much of modern theatre, not least Strindbergian dream-drama, Brechtian expressionism and the Marat/Sade. Even more intrgiuing is Zadek's own use of a whole armoury of theatrical devices. Crazy Gang-style chases through the stalls, after Peer's abduction of a bride, and pantomime pigs and horses remind us of Zadek's deep roots in post-war English theatre. But when a ship is created out of an old bicycle wheel and a pair of chairs, Zadek is clearly tipping his hat to contemporary physical theatre. </p> <p>Even if it doesn't have the Shakespearean feeling for time that marked John Barton's peerless Peer, this is still a fine production; one that combines moral judgement of its hero with a broad humanity. The scenes between Bohm and Angela Winkler as the exasperated, loving, pianfored Aase are very touching. Annett Renneberg's Solveig, waiting for Peer on the 17th floor of a modern tower-block, is both an image of fidelity and a deeply Freudian reminder of the male quest for mother and lover in one person. All told, an evening that deromanticises Ibsen without debunking him and that offers vital proof as to why we still need the international festival. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Ends tonight.

  "<p>Just days after scooping a record \u00a31.2m publishing deal, Piers Morgan has won a payoff of around \u00a31.7m in compensation for the loss of his job as editor of the Daily Mirror.</p> <p>Lawyers for Morgan, who was sacked in May after refusing to apologise for publishing fake photographs purporting to show British soldiers torturing Iraqi prisoners, secured the payoff on Friday. </p> <p>The payment takes into account share options over the next two years, pension entitlements and basic salary.</p> <p>The sum is certain to anger shareholders in the company, some of whom put pressure on chief executive Sly Bailey to sack Morgan in the wake of the fake photographs scandal.</p> <p>Some have already expressed concern about the prospect of \"rewards for failure\" after the paper was forced to publish a humiliating apology and admit it had been duped into publishing the pictures.</p> <p>But Morgan's lawyers advised him that the Mirror would have to prove gross misconduct or reckless dishonesty when he published the photographs - in other words, the paper would have to demonstrate that he knew the photographs - one of which purported to show a British soldier urinating on an Iraqi prisoner - were fake when he published them. In fact, the company has never claimed Morgan knew the pictures had been fabricated.</p> <p>Neither Morgan nor the Mirror would comment on the settlement today, which has been struck after almost three months of negotiation.</p> <p>The agreement was secured by Schillings - the high profile media law firm that represented Naomi Campbell in her successful privacy battle against the Mirror - which Morgan vigorously opposed.</p> <p><strong>Memoirs based on meticulously kept diaries</strong></p> <p>It comes just days after Morgan secured a record \u00a31.2m payment from publishers Ebury Press for his memoirs - triple the \u00a3400,000 former BBC director general Greg Dyke was paid for his memoirs.</p> <p>The Insider, an account of the maverick editor's colourful 15-year career newspaper career, will be published next spring and is based on Morgan's meticulously kept diaries.</p> <p>It is likely to prove an explosive read, covering everything from Morgan's appointment, aged just 28, as the youngest editor of Britain's biggest selling newspaper, the News of the World, to his eventual falling out with Rupert Murdoch and the share-tipping scandal of 2000 that almost claimed his scalp.</p> <p>Ebury is hoping Morgan's revelations will help the book attract a broader readership than many autobiographies, and is positioning it as a \"compulsive read for fans of the political and celebrity autobiography alike\".</p> <p>\"I was incredibly fortunate to be editing newspapers during one of the most tumultuous decades in modern times, a period in which we witnessed the self-implosion of the Tories, the rise of New Labour, the royal family brought to its knees by scandal and tragedy, horrific news events like Dunblane and September 11, and a seemingly endless supply of fantastically entertaining sport and celebrity gossip,\" said Morgan.</p> <p>Like Alastair Campbell, he kept diaries of his 11 years as a newspaper editor, detailing his encounters with figures including politicians, celebrities and people like Rupert Murdoch, who gave him a fierce and public dressing down after the News of the World was found to be guilty of breaching the privacy of former wife of Earl Spencer, when it photographer her in a hospital.</p> <p>He is also expected to give his accounts of dealings with Tony Blair with whom he fell out with after Cherie Blair launched a campaign against him, complaining that he had \"no moral compass\".</p> <p>\"This is not going to be the usual bitter rantings of a sacked editor. Instead, I hope my book will give people an unprecedented insight into the workings of newspapers, and the inside track on the corridors of power in Britain and those who work in them.

  "<p>People under 40 are five times more likely to have a heart attack if they smoke, according to a study published today. </p> <p>The report's authors said the findings, based on figures compiled on behalf of the World Health Organisation, had destroyed the myth that only older smokers were at risk of cardiac disease. </p> <p>The research, which included almost 23,000 non-fatal heart attacks between 1985 and 1994, found four-fifths of victims aged 35-39 were smokers. It was published in the British Medical Journal's Tobacco Control journal and involved study groups in Europe, China, Australia, New Zealand and North America. </p> <p>The report said: \"Although young people may acknowledge the well-documented fact that cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, they, and even physicians, may think that this is only a concern in older age.\" </p> <p>However, the study found that in men and women aged 35-39, the risk of heart attacks was around five times higher among smokers than their non-smoking peers. \"Our data indicates that half of non-fatal myocardial infarctions in men and women younger than 50 years - even more in younger age groups - would be preventable if smoking cessation programmes were successful.\" </p> <p>The study also suggested that women smokers were slightly more susceptible to cardiac disease, particularly among the older age groups. </p> <p>Further research provided bad news for smokers and non-smokers alike, as a separate study in the magazine showed air pollution levels from cigarettes in a confined space were 15 times more than those recorded outside. </p> <p>The experiment was carried out in a garage in the town of Chiavenna, northern Italy, which enjoys low levels of outdoor particulate matter (PM). </p> <p>PM is the most dangerous element of air pollution and comes from various sources including cigarettes and car exhausts. It is a risk factor in conditions such as emphysema, bronchitis, asthma and lung cancer. </p> <p>The authors chose the garage because it was similar in size to rooms found in many offices and homes. They said the results gave \"cause for concern\" because they showed that such exposure to cigarette smoke could account for frequent bouts of short-term respiratory damage in non-smokers. In the experiment, the engine of a 2.0-litre Ford Mondeo containing diesel fuel was left running for 30 minutes in the garage, with the door closed and six small air vents open. The results were then compared with those for smoke emitted from three cigarettes left smouldering in the garage for 30 minutes. </p> <p>The authors also found that, when the cigarettes were lit, PM levels inside were 15 times the levels found outside. But PM levels recorded inside from the diesel engine were just double those found outside.</p>",
  "<p>Red tape is one of the main obstacles faced by vulnerable people trying to access funds that allow them to pay for their own services, a new report has warned.</p> <p>The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) report found that the barriers against successful implementation of direct payments were, \"lots of paperwork, lack of information and councils' reluctance to embrace the scheme\".</p> <p>The direct payments system, a government policy which gives people needing social support the money to arrange their own services, has been criticised for its poor take-up and difficulty of use. Local authorities were set the task of promoting and administering the initiative.</p> <p>Direct payments were introduced in 1997 as part of a strategy to introduce different ways of working with older and disabled people, those with mental health problems, carers over 16, and people with parental responsibility for disabled children.</p> <p>Around 12,600 people used direct payments in September last year, a figure the CSCI said is \"disappointingly low\", even though it compares favourably with 8,000 in 2002 and under 5,500 in 2001.</p> <p>Most of the people who took up direct payments were physically disabled and aged between 18 and 64. Fewer than 2,000 people over 65 were using direct payments and a mere 229 of users had mental health problems.</p> <p>The report urged policy makers and providers to tackle confusing terminology, unnecessary paperwork, and unreasonable criteria.</p> <p>The report recommended that everyone involved in the delivery of direct payments must develop imaginative solutions and said that the voluntary sector should be encouraged to take on an enhanced role providing advocacy and independent support services.</p> <p>It stressed that increasing take-up of direct payments should not become an end in itself, but should represent a 'cultural shift' in public services towards genuinely empowering people to choose and control the way they live their lives.</p>",
  "David Davis, the shadow home secretary, resolutely continued yesterday marching further into the legal quagmire he entered last week. Undeterred by a recent report from the better regulation task force that suggested Britain's growing \"compensation culture\" was a myth generated by the media, Mr Davis insisted it was time to inject more personal responsibility and common sense into the system. We agree with his goal, but disagree with both his analysis and his solution. <p>The task force's report in May produced some powerful arguments. It noted that the cost of civil claims as a proportion of gross domestic product remained largely at 0.6% - one of the lowest of all developed states - for all but one of the last 15 years. It reminded readers of the large proportion of cases that get dropped as well as the relatively modest levels of damages awarded. Over half who win awards in the county courts receive less than \u00a33,000. It rightly warned of the danger of singling out absurd settlements in a system in which there are 700,000 initial claims a year. Mr Davis made much of three yesterday: the teacher who won \u00a355,000 for slipping on a chip; the parents of a girl guide who received \u00a33,500 after their daughter's fingers were singed while cooking sausages; and the prisoner who successful sued the government when he fell off a roof while trying to escape. </p> <p>But the task force's look at the aggregate cost of claims fails to recognise the shifts that can take place within the total. Annual expenditure on claims within the NHS, for example, rose from \u00a31m in 1974 to \u00a3446m in 2002. The man in charge of civil courts, Lord Phillips, the second most senior judge in the country, has spoken of his concern at the way compensation claims are reducing the readiness of local councils to provide sporting or leisure facilities that involve risk. Surveys of employers and local government have shown the total cost of compensation claims - including insur ance and legal fees - rising inexorably. Remember earlier reviews have suggested that for every \u00a3100 gained in personal injury compensation, lawyers walked away with another \u00a385. Then there was the chief medical officer's report pointing to problems beyond the current slow, complex and costly system. As well as engendering a climate of blame, acrimony and confrontation, it also encourages doctors to practice defensive medicine, revealing as little as possible of what has gone wrong, thus making future correction more difficult. </p> <p>Where Mr Davis is wrong is linking the rise in compensation claims with the Human Rights Act. The act may have been passed in 1998, but only came into force in October 2000. Police compensation doubled in the three years before HRA came into effect, pay-outs to injured armed services members quadrupled in the decade up to 2002 and the rise in NHS cases was even steeper. The main drivers - legal ambulance chasers, the introduction of a \"no win, no fee\" legal option, along with greater consumer readiness to sue - have nothing to do with human rights laws. </p> <p>Conservatives voiced strong opposition to HRA from the beginning, using it as a stick with which to beat the anti-European drum. Mr Davis was at it again yesterday, falsely implying that the European convention on human rights (which the HRA incorporates into UK law) imports continental legal principles. Contrary to these claims, the convention was mostly drafted by Conservative British lawyers following traditional British legal principles. The review of the HRA that the Conservative party announced yesterday has the wrong target. What they should be looking at are ways of reducing the role of lawyers. The chief medical officer put forward one model last year. The task force listed other complementary measures including more emphasis on mediation. Mr Davis is right to pursue the burgeoning compensation culture but his recipe is wrong.</p>",
  "A Conservative pledge to consider repealing the Human Rights Act to curb the \"compensation culture\" backfired yesterday when legal experts accused the party of \"alarmist\" and \"hysterical\" behaviour. <p>Within two hours of David Davis, the shadow home secretary, announcing he would set up a commission to look at \"the reform, replacement or repeal of the act\", the Law Society predicted it would conclude that the act merely allowed British courts to deal with human rights abuses \"rather than forcing people to go to Strasbourg for justice\". </p> <p>The Association of Personal Injury Lawyers accused him of \"exacerbating hysteria\", while a leading human rights lawyer, Geoffrey Bindman, described Mr Davis's speech as \"grossly inflated and alarmist\". </p> <p>The government condemned him for \"muddling the European convention of human rights with the compensation culture\", and Labour released a list of Tory frontbenchers and peers who had consistently backed the 1998 bill, including Mr Davis's deputy, Dominic Grieve. </p> <p>The attack came after Mr Davis delivered a speech in which he blamed the Human Rights Act for fuelling the compensation culture. </p> <p>\"The Human Rights Act has spawned too many spurious rights,\" he said. \"It has fuelled a compensation out of all sense and proportion. And all too often, it seems to give criminals more rights than the victims of crime. This has to stop.\" He added: \"Our society needs more discipline, decent values and respect.\" </p> <p>The shadow home secretary cited the cases of the mass murderer Dennis Nielsen, who had secured hard-core pornography in prison after claiming his \"right to information and freedom of expression\" under the HRA, and a group of travellers who had used the act to justify setting up a permanent home in a Cambridgeshire village. </p> <p>Since the legislation came into force in October 2000, enshrining the 1951 European convention on human rights into British law for the first time, it had had a \"serious effect on the operation of the law\", he said. It had been considered in 431 cases and affected the outcome of 381, compared with 316 cases in the 21 years between 1975 and 1996. </p> <p>But, despite it being a \"seriously malfunctioning act of parliament\", he said, a Tory government would remain a member of the European convention - meaning that claimants would have to go to Strasbourg to get justice. </p> <p>His onslaught provoked fury and ridicule from experts. </p> <p>Lord Filkin, a minister in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, said that since the HRA merely incorporated the European convention on human rights, a review was not needed. \"It's been our law effectively for the last 50 years. I think he's muddled and conflating the European convention of human rights with the compensation culture.\" </p> <p>Edward Nally, the president of the Law Society, said: \"Establishing a commission to investigate the ... Human Rights Act will demonstrate the main impact of the act has been to enable British courts to deal with human rights abuses when they arise, rather than forcing people to go to Strasbourg for justice.\"</p> <p>He said the anticipated deluge of claims had not materialised, and that the courts had been \"pretty willing to reject over-adventurous claims\". \"Frankly, we feel he is overplaying the issue and the facts don't bear what he's saying,\" he added.</p>",

  "Hawa Abdullahi's father pulls back her orange shawl to show where a bullet smashed through her upper arm. The 15-year-old girl is in pain and traumatised, but in her family she is the fortunate one. Four of her brothers are dead after an attack they blame on the Janjaweed. <p>\"Maybe God knows why this happened,\" said Maryam Ayacoub Solomon, the mother of the murdered boys. \"I don't know. I don't know what to say - I have no words left.\" </p> <p>Every few days, more refugees from Darfur cross the border into eastern Chad. They all tell the same story; in recent days and weeks, there have been fresh attacks on black African villages involving Janjaweed fighters backed up by Sudanese government troops. </p> <p>Despite a UN security council resolution demanding that Sudan disarms the Janjaweed, Khartoum's war against its own people goes on. </p> <p>UN officials say that 11 vil lages close to the border with Chad are believed to have been cleared in a campaign that began a few days after the security council resolution was passed. </p> <p>Nearly 500 refugees have been registered by the UN after crossing the border at Senett, near the village of Birak in eastern Chad. </p> <p>Abdel Moula Abdullahi, 25, told the Guardian he had escaped an attack on Diba village in west Darfur on August 9. \"They came at 6am. It was raining and everyone was in the village,\" he said. \"The women cried out: 'The Janjaweed are coming'. </p> <p>\"The men and women ran from the village. As they were running, the Janjaweed were shooting. </p> <p>\"The Sudanese military came with five vehicles. They shot the people with machine guns. The Janjaweed threw hand grenades to burn down our houses.\" </p> <p>Mr Abdullahi's home now is a piece of plastic sheeting spread over a framework of branches, with a handful of possessions inside; blackened cooking pans, a dagger and an ancient plastic tub of blue hair gel. There is a waist-high stockade of branches to keep animals out. </p> <p>Another refugee, Osman Yahya Khadir, 52, escaped an attack on Gazmoun village last Wednesday. According to his account, Sudanese military helicopters circled in the sky overhead while Janjaweed attacked on the ground. </p> <p>\"When I heard the noise of the helicopters, I ran to hide in the mountains, because I knew the Janjaweed would come,\" said Mr Khadir, a tall man in a long, white robe. </p> <p>\"I knew from the other villages that it had happened like that. They told me: 'When you hear the helicopters and the planes, the Janjaweed are coming'. </p> <p>\"We drove our herds of animals towards the mountains. The Janjaweed came to take our animals and killed five people.\" Both these villages have previously been attacked by Janjaweed and government forces, and their inhabitants had fled to Chad. </p> <p>In recent months, some refugees had returned across the border to rebuild their lives, but renewed attacks have killed or driven away those who went back to Darfur. </p> <p>Mr Abdullahi, dressed in a khaki green tunic and ragged green trousers, said: \"The first time we were attacked was one year ago. Aeroplanes dropped bombs, and there were Janjaweed on horses and soldiers in cars. My father and my father's brother were killed. </p> <p>\"One month ago, we returned to our village. Everything was destroyed and we rebuilt it all. We only had one or two cows left. </p> <p>\"The government of Sudan sent envoys to Chad to say it is safe to return, and we believed they were telling the truth because they were the state.\" </p> <p>As he speaks, sitting on a straw mat flanked by a group of male refugees, the low growling of an Antonov plane's engines becomes audible. The men fall silent; the Russian-built planes are the favoured bombers of the Sudanese government. </p> <p>Many of the refugees are members of the Djabar tribe, which has not played a large part in the Darfur rebellion. </p> <p>Although there are rebel strongholds to the north and south of the region which has recently come under attack, there is no significant rebel activity in or near these villages. </p> <p>Instead, the motive for the Janjaweed appears to be an opportunity to acquire the livestock of the black villagers and steal their land. </p> <p>It is harder to understand why the government continues to back the Janjaweed when there is no rebellion to crush. The refugees believe it is because the regime in Khartoum is racist. </p> <p>Mr Abdullahi said: \"The government of Sudan doesn't want blacks, they want only Arabs. </p> <p>\"Before the first attack, some Arabs in the region came to tell us: 'We're going to send you blacks away and claim this land for ourselves'.\" </p> <p>The landscape of eastern Chad is a mirror image of Darfur. With the rainy season, a transformation has taken place, and a countryside of barren sand, rock and straggling bushes wears a thin covering of green, as if it has been freshly painted. </p> <p>Herds of camels, goats and cattle are accompanied by wobbly calves, greedily cropping the grass before the dry season returns. </p> <p>But the refugees say their lands in Darfur were far more fertile than the border region. </p> <p>Their rival Arab tribes want the land \"because the land of Darfur is rich, and there are many animals, plenty of riches, oil under the ground,\" said one refugee. </p> <p>Hundreds of refugees have now fled across the border once again. But even here, they claim, they are being pursued by the Janjaweed. </p> <p>On August 12, a family of refugees was sleeping in a stockade of branches at Senett when they were fired on. It was then that Hawa Abdullahi was shot through the arm and her brothers, aged 12, 15, 18 and 21, were killed or fatally injured. </p> <p>Hawa said: \"I was sleeping when I heard something in the night. Before I could ask my brothers what it was, there was gunfire. I got up straightaway, then I was hit in the arm and cried out for my mother.\" </p> <p>According to Hawa's father, Abdullahi Ibrahim, who ran from his sleeping place to the scene of the shooting, the gunman escaped with an accomplice who was holding their horses. They fled in the direction of Sudan. </p> <p>\"This did not happen because they wanted to steal from us,\" Mr Ibrahim said. \"But because this is the manner in which they treat our people.\" </p> <p>Under a burning sun, Mr Ibrahim, a barefoot man in a tattered green robe, goes to pray over three mounds of sandy yellow earth covered in branches.

  "She may once have sobbed she was no superwoman, but Cherie Blair was yesterday declared the most powerful woman in Britain by the US business magazine Forbes. <p>Mrs Blair was judged the 12th most powerful woman in the world, nine places ahead of Margaret Thatcher and 10 above the Queen, but trailing behind American first ladies present and past, Laura Bush (fourth) and Hillary Clinton (fifth). </p> <p>She was one of only six British women on the list, which was unsurprisingly dominated by Americans and topped by the US national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. </p> <p>The pre-eminence of Mrs Blair, Lady Thatcher and the Queen highlights the paucity of British women who operate in their own right as political leaders on the world stage. No members of the government got a look-in in the top 100.</p> <p>Forbes said Mrs Blair was \"best-known as the wife of British prime minister Tony Blair\" but acknowledged that she was a talented professional in her own right.</p> <p>\"Other than living at No 10 Downing Street as Britain's first lady, Blair practises under her maiden name as a queen's counsel with London's Matrix Chambers law firm... Blair gets her power both from her own work and from that of her husband.\"</p> <p>The magazine appeared to have an insight into current goings-on at the Blairs' official residence: \"Today she's helping her husband behind the scenes as Britain continues to weather the storms about its alliance with the US over Iraq.\" </p> <p>Margaret Thatcher's assertion, \"I don't mind how much my ministers talk as long as they do what I say,\" is quoted in the introduction to the Forbes list.</p> <p>According to the magazine, which placed the \"Iron Lady\" in 21st place, she and Ronald Reagan had \"helped usher the collapse of the Soviet Union and pushed for a worldwide embrace of free markets\". It praised her voice as that of \"clear-eyed realism\".</p> <p>One place behind, the Queen was described as remaining \"unflappable\" as she has watched her empire \"nearly lose its worldwide influence\" and endured \"a series of embarrassing tabloid scandals.\" Forbes concluded: \"Britons love her and her sedate demeanour, not to mention her fashion sense.\"</p> <p>The queen of Hogwarts, JK Rowling, the creator of what the magazine calls \"the Harry Potter media phenomenon\", is on the list at No 85. Marjorie Scardino, the chief executive of the Pearson Group, managed 59th place, while the chief executive of the London stock exchange, Clara Furse, squeezed on at 97. </p> <p>Forbes came up with its list by creating a \"power scorecard\". Factors taken into consideration included the woman's title and CV, the size of the \"economic sphere\" in which she yielded power, and the number of media mentions. </p> <p>The judges threw in some \"subjective adjustments\" - giving more points to a current head of state than a former one, for example. There were few surprises at the top of the list - Ms Rice was followed by Wu Yi, the vice-premier of China, and Sonia Gandhi, the president of India's Congress party. </p> <p>Further down in the top 10 came two US supreme court justices, the presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines, and Carleton Fiorina, the head of Hewlett-Packard. </p> <p>But the Forbes researchers claimed the system also picked out \"do-gooders\", including Queen Rania of Jordan (13th) and the head of Unicef, Carol Bellamy (95th). Media stars were featured, with Oprah Winfrey at 62. </p> <p>Mrs Blair may also have been interested in the 51st placing.

  "<p>Fahrenheit 9/11 is astounding. Not so much as a film - although it is cunning and moving - but as an event. Most commentators try to dismiss the event and disparage the film. We will see why later. </p> <p>The artists on the Cannes film festival jury apparently voted unanimously to award Michael Moore's film the Palme d'Or. Since then it has touched many millions across the world. In the US, its box-office takings for the first six weeks amounted to more than $100m, which is, astoundingly, about half of what Harry Potter made during a comparable period. Only the so-called opinion-makers in the media appear to have been put out by it. </p> <p>The film, considered as a political act, may be a historical landmark. Yet to have a sense of this, a certain perspective for the future is required. Living only close-up to the latest news, as most opinion-makers do, reduces one's perspectives. The film is trying to make a small contribution towards the changing of world history. It is a work inspired by hope. </p> <p>What makes it an event is the fact that it is an effective and independent intervention into immediate world politics. Today it is rare for an artist to succeed in making such an intervention, and in interrupting the prepared, prevaricating statements of politicians. Its immediate aim is to make it less likely that President Bush will be re-elected next November. </p> <p>To denigrate this as propaganda is either naive or perverse, forgetting (deliberately?) what the last century taught us. Propaganda requires a permanent network of communication so that it can systematically stifle reflection with emotive or utopian slogans. Its pace is usually fast. Propaganda invariably serves the long-term interests of some elite. </p> <p>This single maverick movie is often reflectively slow and is not afraid of silence. It appeals to people to think for themselves and make connections. And it identifies with, and pleads for, those who are normally unlistened to. Making a strong case is not the same thing as saturating with propaganda. Fox TV does the latter; Michael Moore the former. </p> <p>Ever since the Greek tragedies, artists have, from time to time, asked themselves how they might influence ongoing political events. It's a tricky question because two very different types of power are involved. Many theories of aesthetics and ethics revolve round this question. For those living under political tyrannies, art has frequently been a form of hidden resistance, and tyrants habitually look for ways to control art. All this, however, is in general terms and over a large terrain. Fahrenheit 9/11 is something different. It has succeeded in intervening in a political programme on the programme's own ground. </p> <p>For this to happen a convergence of factors were needed. The Cannes award and the misjudged attempt to prevent the film being distributed played a significant part in creating the event. </p> <p>To point this out in no way implies that the film as such doesn't deserve the attention it is receiving. It's simply to remind ourselves that within the realm of the mass media, a breakthrough (a smashing down of the daily wall of lies and half-truths) is bound to be rare. And it is this rarity which has made the film exemplary. It is setting an example to millions - as if they'd been waiting for it. </p> <p>The film proposes that the White House and Pentagon were taken over in the first year of the millennium by a gang of thugs so that US power should henceforth serve the global interests of the corporations: a stark scenario which is closer to the truth than most nuanced editorials. Yet more important than the scenario is the way the movie speaks out. It demonstrates that - despite all the manipulative power of communications experts, lying presidential speeches and vapid press conferences - a single independent voice, pointing out certain home truths which countless Americans are already discovering for themselves, can break through the conspiracy of silence, the atmosphere of fear and the solitude of feeling politically impotent. </p> <p>It's a movie that speaks of obstinate faraway desires in a period of disillusion. A movie that tells jokes while the band plays the apocalypse. A movie in which millions of Americans recognise themselves and the precise ways in which they are being cheated. A movie about surprises, mostly bad but some good, being discussed together. Fahrenheit 9/11 reminds the spectator that when courage is shared one can fight against the odds. </p> <p>In more than a thousand cinemas across the country, Michael Moore becomes with this film a people's tribune. And what do we see? Bush is visibly a political cretin, as ignorant of the world as he is indifferent to it; while the tribune, informed by popular experience, acquires political credibility, not as a politician himself, but as the voice of the anger of a multitude and its will to resist. </p> <p>There is something else which is astounding. The aim of Fahrenheit 9/11 is to stop Bush fixing the next election as he fixed the last. Its focus is on the totally unjustified war in Iraq. Yet its conclusion is larger than either of these issues. It declares that a political economy which creates colossally increasing wealth surrounded by disastrously increasing poverty, needs - in order to survive - a continual war with some invented foreign enemy to maintain its own internal order and security. It requires ceaseless war. </p> <p>Thus, 15 years after the fall of communism, a decade after the declared end of history, one of the main theses of Marx's interpretation of history again becomes a debating point and a possible explanation of the catastrophes being lived. </p> <p>It is always the poor who make the most sacrifices, Fahrenheit 9/11 announces quietly during its last minutes. For how much longer? </p> <p>There is no future for any civilisation anywhere in the world today which ignores this question. And this is why the film was made and became what it became. It's a film that deeply wants America to survive. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Berger is a novelist and critic</p>",

  "<p>Roy Greenslade is correct in his complaint that the media has broken its own code of conduct in its reporting of the alleged love life of David Blunkett (G2, August 23).

Can you imagine the outcry that would create about the freedom of the press being denied? But at least the idea would begin a public debate about the \"sensational\" tittle-tattle that passes for news, which has done nothing to stem dwindling newspaper sales.

Whenever there is a complaint we will consider it. This may not tally with Greenslade's neat view of the PCC, but we cannot and do not ignore complaints.

  "<p>Broadcaster ITV has fired the starting gun on its non-core disposal programme with the sale of Carlton Books for an estimated \u00a33m. </p> <p>The sale - to a management-led buyout team - is expected to be followed shortly by the disposal of the Moving Picture Company, a post-production business with an estimated value of \u00a325m. </p> <p>City analysts believe ITV has earmarked between \u00a3550m and \u00a3600m of savings from the disposal of non-core assets. </p> <p>The money raised could be paid back to shareholders in the form of a special dividend or buyback.

  "<p>Modern technology is rapidly and radically changing the relationship between students and lecturers - sometimes to the advantage of students, sometimes not. Now there are universities where most official and all unofficial communication between lecturers and students is by email. Changes to essay deadlines, alterations to tutorial times, changes to topic titles all appear not on paper in pigeonholes, but in email in boxes. Even end-of-year grades are accessed via websites. The old, dreaded letter through the post, brought up by an anxious mum and dropped on the pillow long before the student was ready to wake up, has been replaced by a lonely moment of truth in front of a screen.</p> <p>This works well for the computer literate, but not quite so well for those without their own internet access. The advantage, as one student put it, might be \"not having to eyeball your tutor when you are getting a lousy grade\". And it means that \"pigeonholes\" can be checked in the middle of the night.</p> <p>But the disadvantages are obvious where students are unable to access the internet in the university library or in student halls or houses. Students who can't check emails won't know if a tutor has changed a tutorial time or if a course deadline has changed. Some lecturers are finding that it also takes away vital personal contact with the student, who may have been coming up against an unexpected problem that is causing grades to drop. It is far easier to assess that sort of situation when the person is sitting in the chair opposite than via email.</p> <p>Endless websites offer top grade cribbed answers to almost any question set to date. Sadly for would-be cheats, the styles of the answers are quickly spotted by those marking papers. And reworking downloaded material to make it look like your own work is almost as time-consuming as doing proper research.</p> <p>The pressure to use computers and email is creating opportunities for computer companies to offer deals to students - but pay careful attention to the fine print. Buying at a special student discount, even through your university, might mean getting last year's model or a smaller software bundle. That might not matter: the latest computer hardware innovation is not always essential. But it will matter if the software missing from the bundle is, say, Microsoft Works, which will seriously reduce the functionality of your machine and will be so expensive to buy that the computer will end up costing as much as a smarter model bought over the counter. It is worth checking with local computer stores or with direct selling companies - as well as asking your student union and friends and family - before using the \u00a31,000 interest-free overdraft facility student bank accounts offer to buy a machine.</p> <p>In the past two decades, university staff have lead the way as users of internet services and communicators by email. Once universities realised the advantages in improved internal communication of providing free email addresses to all staff - long before the free services started to mushroom - then academics took to their keyboards like divers to oxygen.</p> <p>Some universities lead the way by offering students free email as well. The first to do this were those that realised that if foreign students could keep in easy touch with their families at home, they settled and studied more efficiently.</p> <p>The same, of course, is true of home-grown undergraduates, although their families were not necessarily as computer literate when free email was first available. Now that computers conjoined with televisions are becoming a part of every living room, that is changing.</p> <p>The problem is that the need for computer access has grown so fast that universities are having to run to keep up with demand.</p> <p>King's College London, which was one of the frontrunners offering email access, is still at the forefront, offering an internet portal for all its students. Libraries and public areas are equipped with computer suites, and departments make separate provision, too. Halls of residence, similarly, offer computer connections, and library access, as is the case with most other institutions, is free.</p> <p>But students in some universities complain of a lack of computers and difficulty in getting lines. A standard grumble is: \"There is always a queue in the library.\"</p> <p>A lot of universities are working to upgrade provision. At London Metropolitan, internet access is provided in every possible library site and students can usually find a free machine. In Queen Mary, London, the law department provides dedicated access in all buildings for law students. At the newly-enhanced University of Roehampton, every new student room has an internet link, as is the case in this season's other new university, Bolton, where new halls are being opened with internet links in rooms.</p> <p>Universities usually charge for access in halls of residence. The cost is a fairly standard \u00a350 a term for a phone and broadband connection - not cheap compared with some competitive new broadband offers, but not outrageous either.</p> <p>There are, however, inevitable teething problems as universities fight their way through the jungle of service providers. Some of the phone and internet packages being sold through universities to the captive market in halls make incoming phone calls, for example, as expensive as calls to mobiles. And internet access can be uncertain where reception is bad or systems cannot cope with the demand. For the student, checking prices of services and of computers - and finding the time when the library computer is least used - pays dividends.</p>",
  "<p>Science degrees may not be for everyone but they offer interest, challenges, teamwork and unbeatable job prospects. A recent study from the University of Lancaster Management School found that students of physics, biology and chemistry at A-level have the best future earnings.</p> <p>Despite the stress involved in getting a university place through Clearing, it's worth taking the time to make sure it's the right science course. While a science degree will stand you in good stead full stop, in the wake of ever more specialised degrees, such as sport or forensic science, it's worth considering a more conventional course.</p> <p>For Libby Steele, manager of professional education and development at the Royal Society of Chemistry, there's a lot of confusion over what a degree title actually means. \"There are a huge number of different types of degrees around. Most chemistry degrees will cover inorganic, organic, physical and analytical chemistry. But some chemistry courses are titled chemistry 'and' or 'with' something and there are subtle differences. Courses entitled chemistry \"with\" mean that chemistry will form the major component of the course. Students need to be aware of looking into the degree course content.\"</p> <p>With forensic science, the percentage of chemistry actually in the course can vary enormously. Some may want a lot of chemistry and others not, and it could eventually affect the degree's value in the job market. \"What might be an issue in the future is that people with courses such as forensic science may find that employers do not understand what is in that,\" Steele says. \"It's also about employability. If you are looking into going into forensic science, we are being told by employers that they want a straight chemistry or biology degree.\"</p> <p>Steele's advice is to look below the subject title. \"First of all it may not meet expectations, or students may go into something thinking it's going to be a lot of chemistry or vice versa. Secondly it's about employability; some of these degrees businesses do not understand, and not necessarily because it's not a good degree. It's so important for students to know what doors will be opened or closed.\"</p> <p>In chemistry it may also be worth considering a master of chemistry or science (MChem/MSci) rather than a straight bachelors course. \"BSc is a good basic degree and could be used as a stepping stone to go on with, but MChem is viewed much more favourably - it's seen to be the professional qualification for those wishing to pursue a career in chemistry,\" she says.</p> <p>As far as the pros and cons of a specialist science degree versus a more conventional, \"straight\" science degree goes, it's really a question of nuance, and preference - take, for example, the difference between a scientific specialism, such as neuroscience, and a specialist science degree with a vocational bent. </p> <p>Neuroscience has no particular vocational outcome, and is a valuable science degree to have studied regardless of whether you pursue a career in neuroscience at the end. With vocational science degrees, such as forensic science, however, you need to be certain it holds credibility in the workplace.</p> <p>For instance, if you want to make surfboards for a living, a degree in surf science may not be genuinely valued in the job market. Unless this is the case, another specialist but more conventional degree such as naval architecture or fluid dynamics might be a better bet, says Nigel Percival, director of education liaison at University College, London.</p> <p>For those with no particular career path in mind, or who are unsure of exactly what they want to do with their degree, opting for a general science degree to start with is a good option, says Percival.</p> <p>\"Start off with something quite broad and then specialise as you go along. But if you are sure you want to be a molecular biologist, then it won't hurt to get stuck in straight away. It's often just as easy to broaden out in later career.\"</p> <p>Julia King, a successful engineer and chief executive of the Institute of Physics, believes any science degree is worthwhile. \"If by having degrees like forensic chemistry and sports science we attract more young people to do science and engineering degrees, then I'm not going to knock it.\" The physics equivalent is tacking astronomy on to the title, but King is not against this either: \"Using astronomy to attract young people in to do a physics degree is actually a very positive thing.\" </p> <p>If you enjoyed science at school, don't agonise too much over what you do for your degree, except to do something you will find interesting and challenging, she advises. For King, science and engineering degrees are just that. They use a wide range of teaching styles - not all lectures - with lots of time in lab classes and doing projects, while still having the opportunity to be independent and creative. And there is team-based teaching, which is a big plus for some people. </p> <p>\"There's not a lot of sitting on your own reading complex texts, there's a lot of working with colleagues and plenty of people to ask if you get stuck. That's one of the things I enjoyed about coming through the science and engineering route. You don't have to be on your own for very long and if you're the kind of person who does things better with other people, and gets ideas from talking to other people, then it's a great way of working.\"</p> <p>But King agrees that the quality of a degree is all-important. \"The most transferable qualities of a science degree are quite often more the qualities of a pure science degree than the more jazzy-titled degrees. That rigorous analytical approach - keeping your mathematical skills going, learning to design experiments and deliver a well argued case with the evidence or proof for the various stages in your logic chain - is incredibly useful across such a wide area. You might be passionate about carrying on in science or go into another area, but you'll find that's a set of skills that will stand you in very good stead in life.\"</p> <p>While it may be the least of students' worries before starting a degree, the job prospects at the end of it should be considered. \"It's worth having an idea of what you want to do at the end,\" says Steele. The RSC has put together a leaflet that should help to guide students through that process and give them an idea of which course will suit them best. It's specifically aimed at chemistry, but has key questions about courses that will apply to all science degrees.</p> <p>The job prospects with a science degree in hand don\u00c0t come much better, for whatever walk of life. \"Where more and more people are gaining degrees, I think employers are definitely more impressed by a science degree on a CV, certainly where the job doesn't need a specific subject to have been studied,\" says Elizabeth Barlow, a PhD student of astronomy at the University of Southampton. \"I think it will be assumed that a science graduate has a better grasp of IT, is used to having to tackle problems and isn't scared of technology or numbers.\" Being able to write scientific reports might be a more useful skill when it comes to getting jobs than writing essays, Barlow suggests.</p> <p>Scientists are snapped up by the big City law and financial firms and, increasingly, by the media. \"With the government's drive to improve public sympathy for science, which it will need to do if it really is to build the UK up to be an R&amp;D [Research and Development] centre, we're going to have a growing science media,\" says King. \"There will be opportunities in television, radio and newspapers for literate people with a science background. So if you're interested in media, a science degree can still be a hugely useful thing to do.\" The prospects are also particularly good for scientists going into teaching. The government's recently announced science strategy recognises the dire shortage of science teachers. \"Now there's a \u00a37,000 training bursary and a golden hello of \u00a35,000. For \"advanced skills\" teachers there's a minimum of between \u00a340,000 and \u00a345,000 and no cap on what they can earn. If you're a really bright scientist you can earn some very decent salaries in teaching with high-quality qualifications,\" says King. </p> <p>\"I think there's also a pretty good 'save the world' banner that goes with science and engineering. It isn't all going to be done with genetics; tackling energy, for example, will need a lot of physics, chemistry and engineering.\"</p> <p>Despite common media depictions, scientists needn't be nerds. Barlow took time out after starting a career in the City to pursue her passion: diving. Over a hundred dives later, she came back to the UK with renewed enthusiasm for science and found it easy to pick up where she left off years earlier. \"Postgrad study was surprisingly easy to get into, even after a break from the subject,\" she says. And funded PhD positions are widely available, unlike for arts graduates, who are forced to tout their PhD research proposal like a business plan. </p> <p>For Barlow, it's hard to think of a reason for not doing a science degree. \"Maybe the subject matter is harder to grasp, but it just depends on how your mind works. As long as I don't have to do essays I'm happy, and it's not true that you have to be good at maths to do a science degree,\" she says. </p> <p>It's not just the variety of potential jobs, it's the potential earnings involved. While this is not top of most students' minds, it will be an increasingly important factor in degree choice for students graduating with elephantine debts once top-up fees come in. So, don't be disheartened by not getting into your first choice of university. Wherever you go you will end up loving it. But use this time to take stock and make sure you get the most out of your degree.</p> <p><strong>Case studies</strong><br> <strong>\"My 20-year-old son just happens to be in the same class as me\"</strong><br> Dallas Monro, 48, is studying computing science at the University of Aberdeen<br></p> <p>\"While I was working as an electrician, I decided to go to night school to do an ONC [ordinary national certificate] in electronics. I worked for about two years in building maintenance and then I lost my job.</p> <p>I've always been interested in computers because of my electronics background and had wanted to go to university, but had been too worried about it affecting my job to do anything about it. So I decided to take this opportunity to apply to do computing science at Aberdeen.</p> <p>I got a conditional offer and was accepted after completing an intensive course at the university's summer school. The summer school was fantastic - I'd have been lost without it.</p> <p>The workload has been bearable. I've managed to keep on top of it by starting my assignments early.</p> <p>Alongside my core course, I'm doing English, maths, environmental studies and astrophysics. I've got to resit maths, but everything else has been fine.</p> <p>During the first year I had every Wednesday off, which I used for doing my assignments. But in the second year I have had lectures every day.</p> <p>Being at the university and building a relationship with the tutors has been fantastic. They're very approachable: you can speak to them after a session or email them to make an appointment.</p> <p>There are quite a few mature students and I was surprised to see how many women are on the course. My 20-year-old son just happens to be in the same class as me.

I love being at Queen Mary. It's in the heart of east London and there's a great atmosphere. It's part of the University of London, which carries weight with prospective employers, and it has great facilities. There is a building completely dedicated to computers, and it's open really late.</p> <p>I've just completed my BSc and will be starting an MSc in September. When I first started my degree, I didn't really understand the difference between computer science and computing, and the course was more mathematics-based than I expected. I still loved it though, because I love maths.</p> <p>There were very few girls on the course, which I found a bit challenging at times, but the boys were all very nice. We were like a little family - revising together and spending all our time in the IT lab, leaving at 11pm every night. Queen Mary is very full-on. During term-time you are bombarded with coursework, assignments and projects, so you're left with very little time to socialise. Some people joined societies and things, but I concentrated on the work.</p> <p>For my final-year project, I created some software that teaches people sign language. I contacted a company that produces software for deaf people to obtain the copyright to use some of their videos and I built up a relationship with them, which resulted in them helping me to market my software. It's the first undergraduate project to be commercialised and the university has been very supportive.</p> <p>I've now signed a five-year contract with the company, so whenever they've got something they want me to do they contact me. I feel really lucky because I've already got a job and a lot of the students who left last year are still looking.\"<br> <strong>Interviews by Katie Shimmon</strong></p>",
  "On Sunday evening Karim al-Zuheiri was watching Iraq's footballers play Australia at the Olympics. There had been no power for weeks in Najaf's old city where he lives; and so - ignoring the shellfire from the nearby Imam Ali shrine - Mr Zuheiri hooked up his television to a car battery. <p>He and four friends were on the pavement watching the first half when they heard several shots. \"We realised an American sniper was shooting at us,\" Mr Zuheiri said yesterday. \"We ran inside like gazelles. By the grace of God we got the TV set back on in time to see Iraq score. With the goal we forgot some of our sadness and pain.\" </p> <p>For the past three weeks the dusty alleyway where Mr Zuheiri lives has been transformed into a war zone. The road is 500 metres south of Najaf's golden-domed shrine, where the rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's militia have been holding out against the US army. </p> <p>To get to the shrine you have to go past Mr Zuheiri's terraced corner house, across a shot-up boulevard and through a dense network of small lanes. From there it is a sprint left to the shrine's gateway, opposite Najaf's souk. </p> <p>\"If you walk 20 metres beyond my house you are at the frontline,\" Mr Zuheiri said. </p> <p>In the past two days US tanks have advanced further towards the shrine than ever before, encircling the south and east of the complex. They already control the west, and have been pulverising the Wadi al-Salam cemetery to the north. </p> <p>Last night, smoke rose above the Old City within a mile of the shrine. Shrapnel fell in the courtyard of the gold-domed mosque, whose outer walls have already been damaged. </p> <p>Given their superiority, Mr Zuheiri said yesterday he could not understand why the US military had not yet finished the job. \"It took them nine or 10 days to invade Iraq and get rid of Saddam Hussein,\" he said. \"Why can't they get rid of Moqtada?\" </p> <p>But with the battle for Najaf entering a stage of bloody attrition, life for the civilians caught in the middle has become intolerable. </p> <p>Five days ago, a US tank pulled up outside the house of Yassir al-Abayechi, one of Mr Zuheiri's neighbours, whose home is now on the wrong side of the frontline. </p> <p>\"The tank suddenly appeared,\" said Mr Abayechi, a 22-year-old student. \"The American soldier in it started shouting, 'Go, go.' I understand a few words of English so I grabbed my stuff and ran. I took my mother, sister and brother. We haven't been back.\" </p> <p>Mr Abayechi was bitterly critical of all sides: \"If I step out of my house I get killed in a mortar attack. If I criticise the Mahdi army they will kill me. If I attack the interim government they will kill me. And if I attack the Americans they will kill me as well.\" </p> <p>He said that Saddam had arrested and executed his father and uncle in 1985, but that life under his regime was preferable to the current situation: \"Under Saddam we were living in a big prison, but there was security. Now they claim we have democracy, but what is the point of that if we don't have security?\" he asked. </p> <p>At least 52 civilians have been killed and 223 wounded in Najaf since Mr Sadr launched his latest uprising. Mr Zuheiri said an old woman living a few doors away had been one of the victims. </p> <p>\"An American sniper shot her in the chest and stomach,\" he said. \"It was impossible to get her to hospital. She died. We, the people of Najaf, are the victims of all this.\" </p> <p>Civilians in Najaf's old city have had no water or electricity since the fighting began. They have had no ration cards for two months, and are running out of food. </p> <p>While we were sitting in Mr Zuheiri's sweltering front room, a group of Mahdi army fighters knocked on the door, demanding to know who we were. Several minutes later an American tank rumbled past. </p> <p>When someone is killed, residents say it is not always easy to know who to blame. </p> <p>The night bombings by US jets are terrifying, they say. \"We didn't sleep,\" said Mr Zuheiri, who teaches at the local primary school. </p> <p>Soon after midnight yester day a US warplane pounded the city again. Artillery exchanges continued until the fighting eased at 8am. </p> <p>By lunchtime the mortars had started again, crashing into Najaf's cemetery. </p> <p>\"We don't want a bloodbath in the holy city,\" said one of Mr Zuheiri's relatives, Sabar al-Zuheiri. \"We call on the Islamic world to intervene.\" </p> <p>And what about the Olympics? Could Iraq's football team surprise the world and win the gold medal after its 1-0 victory over Australia? </p> <p>\"I don't think so,\" Mr Zuheiri said.</p>",
  "Fifteen British tourists on a horse-drawn carriage trip in Norway were injured yesterday when the horses took fright and flipped their carts. The accident happened as 51 Britons were returning from a glacier tour near Stryn in south-west Norway. <p>Police told Sky News that the animals had become frightened on the steep descent, overturning carts and flinging the passengers to the ground. Three rescue helicopters went to the aid of the injured, most of whom are believed to be pensioners. </p> <p>Six tourists and their Norwegian guide were flown to hospitals in Alesund and Foerde after the accident near the Briksdal glacier. Three were said to have suffered head injuries or broken bones. </p> <p>\"They are moderately injured. There is no life-threatening danger to them and they are being observed during the night,\" said a local doctor, Terge Takle. </p> <p>He said two of the patients had suffered fractured bones which would be operated on today. </p> <p>The police chief, Nils Erik Eggen, said the British group was travelling along the scenic route in 17 separate carriages when the accident happened. </p> <p>\"This is a very narrow, steep mountain road which is partly very steep. They were about one kilometre from the glacier,\" he said. </p> <p>He said a group of Japanese tourists was injured in a similar accident in the same place about four years ago. </p> <p>\"It is a place visited by thousands of tourists every year because it is a very scenic part of Norway. Lots of tourists go there every day and most of them go by horse for the last few kilometres. It is a marvellous tourist route even for Norwegians. It is spectacular.\" </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman denied reports that the horses had stampeded. \"They were travelling in horse-drawn carriages when something spooked the horses and they bolted,\" she said. </p> <p>\"We are in contact with the local authorities. We have people in Bergen and Alesund working with the local authorities to try to check the welfare and safety of the Britons involved.\" </p> <p>Charles Davies, a spokesman for the British embassy in Oslo, said: \"There has been an accident and we are trying to identify the facts of the case. </p> <p>The Briksdal, which rises to a height of 1,200 metres, is one of Norway's most spectacular glaciers; it is visited by around 300,000 tourists every year.</p>",
  "Your article on lap dancing clubs in Glasgow (I like my job, says the lap dancer, August 21) seems to be more interested in shooting the messenger than addressing the important issues involved. If Glasgow city council has decided to act on Julie Bindel's report, it suggests that it was a substantive and robust piece of work. <p>The council is to be commended for commissioning the research and taking this issue seriously. Against Ms Bindel's apparently extensive research, your article offers a quotation from a 19-year-old lap dancer who says she likes the work (what else is she going to say?) and an extensive quote from one of the lap dancing club owners who, surprisingly, does not like the propriety of his and other clubs being questioned. </p> <p>Recent research from Sheffield has shown the overlap between lap dancing and prostitution, and the ways in which young women are being exploited in these establishments. A wide-ranging group of progressives, including feminists and non-feminists, are campaigning to unionise sex workers, protect their their rights and limit abuses within the sex trade. </p> <p>Indeed, rather than pretend that there is no problem, as your article seems to do, there is an urgent need for more detailed research into the operation and proliferation of lap dancing clubs as well as of the growth of the increasingly lucrative sex industry in Britain. <br><b>Prof Roger Matthews</b><br> Middlesex University</p>",
  "Youths wearing Burberry shirts in Leicester town centre have been banned from two pubs owned by the Barracuda Group. Mild amusement was afforded at the weekend by the fact that Tony Blair was photographed wearing a Burberry top in Italy, though what with the high probability that this was a freebie from a prominent Italian - and not to wear it might be considered an affront that would lead to his getting less free stuff next year - he has so far escaped a ban from any drinking establishment. <p>Oh, and besides, the ban only applies where the uniform bisects other telltale signs of hooliganism: travelling in a large group of same-gender friends, cutting your hair short, making a lot of noise. PC Karen Holdridge, of Leicestershire police's violence and disorder team, said: \"Well known football hooligans have a dress code. These people are recognised as coming into the city centre day in, day out and causing trouble.\" </p> <p>Sure, sure - all very true, but omitting to mention the fact that a lot of people wear this stuff who aren't hooligans, for the simple reason that it is trendy. This is no Clockwork Orange garb sought out so that a trio of young psychos can look threateningly different. Everyone wears it; Danniella Westbrook wears it; the only reason I don't wear it is that I'm too middle class, plus the skirts are too short and they show my fat bits. </p> <p>Here's the rub - people talk about \"yob culture\" and \"hooligan culture\" to describe behaviour that is usually not illegal, causes no lasting damage, but that they just find very annoying. That milky suffix \"culture\" allows tags of criminality to be applied to people who have committed no crime. Naturally, these men wearing Burberry might go on to commit a crime. It is likely that the people who will commit a crime at the end of the night, or at some later point, will own a garment featuring the distinctive check. But it's equally likely that everyone facing any charge of high-level fraud owns a shirt by Hackett, or Thomas Pink. </p> <p>Numerous crimes - pretty much all crimes that aren't domestic - are associated with structures of fellowship: groups whose momentum in pursuit of their common interest interferes with their personal ethics. This momentum might come from booze or it might come from farcical amounts of money. It might gather more pace in groups who have less to lose. Reason still dictates that you can't exclude or castigate people for sharing a sartorial profile with other people who behave criminally. </p> <p>So what is this behaviour, that Blunkett et al feel legitimate in describing as yobbish, and yet isn't illegal? Principally, it is being drunk and noisy. This irritates me as well. But I'm way more irritated by art students, with their piping, over-confident voices, bellowing on the top of the bus about some tripe that involves cutting turf into the shape of a car. (Man alive! They've disturbed a relationship between rural and urban!) I'm irritated by braying, corn-fed men in rugby shirts. In other words, people with very posh voices, who don't have the grace to camouflage or muffle them, send me crazy. And don't think this is irrational. In parading, rather than hiding, a moneyed accent, people are saying: \"I'm not ashamed of the privilege of my class. Indeed, I think I deserve it. This whole business suits me rather well.\" That's social carelessness. </p> <p>Then there is obscenity. A judge recently barred a juror for wearing a Fcuk T-shirt. What is the world coming to when you can be offended by an anagram? Max Hastings, on these pages, described upbraiding a youth for having \"I am a cunt\" written across his top. OK, it's a bit balder - but a caramel silk vest top from Jaeger, a flock of cashmere pashminas, a pair of Tod's men's driving shoes: these all say, \"I am a cunt\" to me. Graffiti annoys a lot of people. It tickles me. If we are talking about polluting a public space with coarse messages, I feel more offended by almost all adverts (at the moment: \"It's not your shirt, it's not your job, it's not your blah ... it's your watch that says the most about you.\" Just Fcuk off! </p> <p>And what does that leave us, yobwise? It leaves us with litter. Litter really is bad. I used to be an inveterate litterer until a bloke saw me drop an apple core on the floor of a train and said: \"People like you think there are people born to clear up after you.\" I was so ashamed that I picked it up and ate it. Yes, even the hairy bit. </p> <p>Otherwise, if you mean criminal, say it, and back it up with actual crime. If you mean noisy, say noisy. And if you mean I just don't like young, working-class people, then for God's sake say so. Don't hide behind yob, or culture, or any combination thereof. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:zoe_williams@ntlworld.com\">zoe_williams@ntlworld.com</a></p>",
  "It's midnight at the Hyatt Regency hotel in the Spanish resort of La Manga Club and the bars are packed with British middle classes revelling, but only mutedly. In Spike's, there's a band doing what the generous would call a spirited rendition of Beyonc\u00e9's Crazy in Love. A bemulleted white man is trying to rap like Jay-Z with undeniable gusto, while a singer gamely belts and warbles over taped horns. The dance floor is occupied by that rare sight, sartorially blameless Britons abroad, some singing \"Uh oh uh oh. Uh-oh-oh-oh,\" at the right moments. <p>In the Lorca bar, 57-year-old pianist Brian Chapman, who has been entertaining people here for decades, boldly segues from Cockney Rebel's Come Up and See Me to Elvis Presley's Suspicious Minds. Barry and Susan Jones, accountants from Reading, sing along from their table, misquoting Steve Harley and mangling the tune, while their teenage children stare blankly into the middle distance. There really ought to be decisive action against these kinds of public outrage, but as yet the authorities on the Costa Calida have not seen fit to tackle the problem. </p> <p>In any case, the Hyatt has witnessed uglier scenes - most of them involving footballers. Four years ago, the then Leicester City striker Stan Collymore let off a fire extinguisher and team mates were said to have terrified 40 guests in the Lorca bar, allegedly harassing women and dancing on tables. </p> <p>\"We threw the team out after that incident and vowed never to let Leicester City back,\" says La Manga Club's managing director, Tony Coles. \"But, sadly for us, we changed our minds because we were assured that they could behave responsibly.\" </p> <p>There was also the incident in 1998 when Paul Gascoigne, unable to master his emotions in the traditional British manner after being left out of the England World Cup squad, was reported to have trashed his room at the Hyatt. \"That was blown out of all proportion,\" says Coles. \"He didn't trash his room. He kicked a chair. If I'd been left out of the squad, I'd have kicked a chair. Wouldn't you?\" </p> <p>Then there were reports last year that the Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand had brawled with hotel staff. But worst of all, there was the incident in February of this year when Leicester City (again) arrived at La Manga for a mid-season break in the sun. Their stay came to a grubby end when three players were accused by three women of sexual assault in the Hyatt. Spanish authorities eventually dropped the charges against Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie, but only after the men spent a week in jail. </p> <p>\"When we looked at the security tapes, we saw just three ordinary women who looked like they had come for the weekend with some Scandinavian friends,\" says Coles. Were they prostitutes? \"There are no prostitutes here and no drugs - in so far as you can guarantee those things. We knew those guys had done nothing illegal but we couldn't say anything at the time because of sub judice rules in Spain.\" </p> <p>He says that there were no cancellations as a result of the adverse publicity, and that currently the resort is at 90% occupancy. But these incidents have given La Manga Club - a resort sprawling amid the lemon groves, bougainvillea and rock gullies of south-eastern Spain with spectacular views over the Mediterranean - a raffish reputation. Now La Manga's owner, P&amp;O, has announced that it is going to sell the resort, valued at \u00a3100m. prompting a renewed rash of headlines about its seamy past. </p> <p>The British press, fans complain, never accentuate the positive about La Manga. Beyond the security checkpoint, this aspirational 1,220-acre resort has three championship golf courses, a 28-court tennis centre, a state-of-the art spa, terrace restaurants and bars, secluded beach, horse-riding and diving facilities. </p> <p>It has been, footballers notwithstanding, a very British, and a very middle-class, kind of touristic paradise. Brits come here to mingle with their own kind and never have to speak a word of Spanish. There's crown-green bowling and Sky TV is readily available in bars and hotels. \"If people want to come here from Britain for a holiday,\" argues Coles, \"have very little to do with Spanish culture but stay in their apartments or hotel rooms or bars watching Sky TV why shouldn't they?\" </p> <p>La Manga Club is, like ClubMed, part of a global trend towards huge resorts for the upwardly mobile tourist. They are designed as places where you can check out any time you like but, thanks to all the manifold facilities on offer, you never want to leave. In La Manga, the leisure equivalent of a gated estate, the well-to-do can hole up for some decorous rest and relaxation without the riff-raff getting in to spoil their holidays or menace their kids. Clearly they are not for everyone: especially not for those who go abroad to get away from the British. </p> <p>The resort has been supplying tennis, golf, diving, horse riding and pool side-lounging holidays for more than three decades. Generations of Brits have bought up their little bits of Spanish paradise here in the form of 1,675 apartments and villas - and have have seen three-fold equity gains in the past decade. Formula One champion Nigel Mansell lives quietly in a villa here, Bruce Forsyth is no stranger to the resort's golf courses, and even Bianca from EastEnders chose to get married at La Manga, arranging it so that she was discreetly screened from public and press with a barrage of golfing umbrellas. </p> <p>But the footballing scandals have undeniably tarnished the resort's reputation. One newspaper called it \"a middle-management Faliraki\"; but while Faliraki is the home of binge-drinking, high-jinksing, mass-vomiting Brits, La Manga's clientele for the most part behave discreetly and, if wealthy, do not flaunt their wherewithal. True, there are some villas at La Manga that are valued at \u00a332m and the best suite in the five-star Hyatt costs more than \u00a3750 a night, but for the most part this is a middle-class resort. Two- bedroom apartments can be bought for \u00a3150,000. Self-catering accommodation can be had for as little as \u00a340 per night. </p> <p>And the raffish reputation is also broadly unfair. True, at the local airport (Murcia) one may glimpse a young British teenage girl with her mother, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with a football and the characteristically charmless FCUK slogan \"Wanna find my penalty spot?\", but La Manga's clientele, on the basis of what I saw, eschews such vulgarity. It's the kind of place where if, after winning a match on one of the clay courts, you pull off your shirt in celebration, you might well be quietly told to put it back on. </p> <p>Terry and Joan Prudhoe, from Hertfordshire, are on their way to a morning of tennis coaching, having deposited their daughter at the mini-club creche at a cost of \u00a350 for the day. He is an estate agent, she is in IT, and this is the second time they have stayed for a week's holiday. \"It's got everything for us in terms of activities. It feels really safe for kids, and there's lots for them to do,\" says Joan. \"We've become quite besotted with the place.\" The couple are considering buying a villa there. </p> <p>Many Brits have done so already. There are some French, Dutch and Scandinavians, but the resort is overwhelmingly British - they own more than 85% of the property and account for more than 60% of the resort's business. </p> <p>La Manga was established in the near-desert landscape in 1972 as a golf resort by an American investor. At the time there was scarcely any road infrastructure and only one flight a week from Britain. Today, the region is well served with pristine motorways and frequent, low-cost flights from Britain for as little as \u00a350 each way - services that have accelerated the resort's development since the late 1990s. </p> <p>Under P&amp;O's ownership, La Manga Club became not just a golf resort but a real-estate and holiday haven. Although established 32 years ago, it only went into profit five years ago (last year it made \u00a35m), and is continuing to expand with new villa developments and a spa that opened in March. There are plans for La Manga to eat further into the Spanish countryside, taking over 84 acres of land for commerical or residential development. It seems, then, on the face of it, a strange time for P&amp;O to put it up for sale - unless the decision was prompted by the lurid stories involving off-duty footballers. \"No, that's complete rubbish,\" says Lorenzo Martinez, La Manga's director of tennis and leisure. \"P&amp;O has been planning to sell the place for about a year - long before the Leicester City thing.\" It is more likely the sale is part of a global retrenchment aimed at helping the loss-making company focus on its core business of port management and ferries. Three P&amp;O-owned resorts in Australia have been sold off, and the company is also to dispose of the \u00a349m Manchester Arena. </p> <p>But who will buy La Manga? Of course, any great rich galoot could tranform it from an aspirational playground for muted England, into something that its current clientele would regard as hideous. It could become a new EuroDisney, sucking in Brits from Benidorm to Malaga. \"We are worried, of course we are, about what the future holds,\" says Martinez. \"Not just people like me but all of the 650 staff and a lot of the people who stay and live here. It's too lovely a place to be ruined.\" </p> <p>Unless of course, you think La Manga Club is a blot on a landscape, a testament to the banality of the middle class's hedonisitic dreams, and a place that would do better to become desert once more.</p>",
  "<p>The first woman ever to win gold in Olympic wrestling screamed with delight, subsided into floods of tears and leapt into the arms of an astonished referee. Five minutes later she was still sobbing and tearing at her hair on the podium. Irini Merleni could be forgiven her Bridget Jones moment. </p> <p>Merleni, a Ukrainian with the world's most aggressive pigtails, really did resemble Bridget Jones on a bad-hair day. But what a bad-hair day: she routed the American, Patricia Miranda, in the semis and Japan's Chiharu Icho, the youngest of the fearsome Icho sisters, deservedly followed on a referee's verdict in the final. It was tigerish, it was talented; as an Olympic sport it was entirely legitimate. </p> <p>One of the more gratifying sounds of a modern Olympics is that of Baron de Coubertin turning in his grave. If he flipped over the introduction of women's weightlifting in Sydney, he will have triple-salchowed in Athens at his first sight of women wrestlers. If boxers are ever admitted, prepare for him to take gold in grave gymnastics. </p> <p>\"The ruggedness of male exertion is much to be dreaded when it comes to the female\" - before Merleni plots violent retribution, it is best to point out the quote belonged to Coubertin. As did his suggestion that, when it comes to the Olympics, women should concentrate on exalting the male form by engaging in periodic bouts of polite applause. </p> <p>As of yesterday they engage instead in strategy, stamina and controlled violence. They are the stars of the Ano Liossia Hall, an Olympic outpost on Athens' scrubby northern fringes. </p> <p>Not that finding a comment to capture this historic moment was easy. Merleni was too overcome with her gold in the 48kg freestyle to make much sense, and Icho was too concerned about the knock-on effect her defeat might have on her older sister, Kaori, to engage in theorising about the cultural advancement of women. </p> <p>She observed (although one suspects the translator tidied it up a bit): \"I regret I have no thoughts at this time about the effect upon women in Japan by the presence of women's wrestling in the Olympics.\" </p> <p>So it fell upon Merleni's masseuse, a friendly, strapping lass, to make a point in broken English that brooked no argument. \"Wrestling now for woman. Ukraine women. Ukraine women very beautiful.\" </p> <p>Miranda will now study for a law degree at Yale. She does pottery, plays the piano and her parents were political refugees from Brazil. She would be a natural hero in a Pelecanos crime novel. At Stanford University, when she was not fighting men, she was fighting the jibes. \"I couldn't count how many people were sceptical about my wrestling.\" </p> <p>Japan had three finalists in the four weight categories last night. Kaori Icho did take gold after all at 63kg and there was another for Saori Yoshida at 55kg. Kyoko Hamaguchi, who carried the Japanese flag in the opening ceremony, had to settle for bronze. Between them they symbolise the rise of women's sport in Japan. </p> <p>Hamaguchi's semi-final loss to the Chinese, Wang Xu, had caused quite a stir. Her father, \"Animal\" Hamaguchi, a former professional wrestler of renown, leapt from the stands shouting: \"That's impossible. It's not on. They've made a mistake.\" He was restrained by security staff and returned to his seat, to be berated by his wife. </p> <p>Japan's ancient scripts tell of legendary female warriors and, if the samurai culture put paid to that, those battling qualities live on in the Icho sisters. </p> <p>Both were wrestling by the age of five and last year they became the first sisters to win world titles in the same year. Chiharu had Kaori in her corner as her coach and, after the bout, dropped to her knees in front of her, partly with exhaustion, partly from homage. Last night, after Kaori won gold, she dropped to her knees in relief.</p>",
  "<p>It was a beautiful evening on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico in February 2003 and the aromatic smell of a barbecue was still lingering in the warm night air. A few hours earlier Paula Radcliffe had set a world record for the 10 kilometres and was sharing a well-deserved bottle of red wine with the small group of journalists who had travelled to San Juan to report on her performance. </p> <p>The Bedford runner was reflecting on how she had suddenly become the hottest runner in the sport following a series of record-breaking performances. Radcliffe had always enjoyed a good gossip about the latest rumours on the circuit and was quite happy to share them with writers who had followed her since she was a teenager. </p> <p>Fast-forward a year. It is the same scene, except Radcliffe had been beaten in an individual race for the first time in nearly two years. She was again drinking a glass of wine but on this occasion there was a definite edginess about her manner. </p> <p>It was not the defeat that appeared to bother her as much as the impending media pressure she feared leading up to this year's Olympics. Radcliffe and Gary Lough, her husband, training partner and agent, were already being swamped with requests for interviews and they feared it would impinge on her preparations for Athens. </p> <p>The handful of reporters who had again made the effort to travel to Puerto Rico (not too much of a hardship in the middle of a British winter) suggested the couple arrange a series of media days where she could deal with everyone at once. </p> <p>The next occasion on which the same journalists tried to contact Lough, the following month after Radcliffe's withdrawal from the world cross-country championships with a hamstring injury, they discovered all the telephone numbers no longer worked. Instead they were referred to Octagon, a London-based management agency which specialises in representing high-profile sportsmen and women, including Anna Kournikova and Patrick Vieira. </p> <p>The lady at Octagon explained that because Radcliffe wanted to concentrate on Athens and Lough needed to help her he was no longer dealing with media inquiries and that from now on journalists would have to deal with her. It signalled the start of a period where Radcliffe became a virtual recluse, where her life was seemingly going to be defined by what she achieved here on August 22. </p> <p>Radcliffe claimed not to have known what was being written about her in the media and how she was a dead cert to strike marathon gold but Lough is an avid surfer of the worldwide web and would have been acutely aware of how much pressure there was on his wife. </p> <p>He has been regularly criticised in the media ever since the 2001 world championships in Edmonton where he stormed on to the track to confront her angrily after he felt she had not run very well following her fourth place in the 10,000 metres. But Lough is totally devoted to his wife's career. He can be a nervous individual, regularly becoming ill on the eve of Radcliffe's big races, a sign of how much he wants her to be successful. </p> <p>It was clear to anyone who attended Radcliffe's emotional press conference yesterday that he was feeling the pain of her defeat as much as her. The Northern Irishman arrived next to Radcliffe, looking haunted, caught in the glare of a hundred flashbulbs. He stood at the back of the room being comforted by Allison Curbishley, a former 400-metre runner, a close friend of the couple and here as commentator for Radio Five Live. </p> <p>Lough's upset was easy to understand. For months he and Radcliffe had relied mostly on each other for support. They had for occasional comfort only their physiotherapist, Gerhard Hartmann, and Alex Stanton, Radcliffe's coach. Their dedication was amazing but at times it must have been suffocating. There were few opportunities to socialise with people who did not share the couple's obsessive vision of Olympic glory. </p> <p>Perhaps preparing under that kind of intense pressure - the endless miles run around the trails of Font Romeu in the French Pyrenees, followed by the massages, specially prepared meals and the necessity to get 12 hours sleep a day - led to her imploding in the Greek capital on Sunday. The gold medal became an all-encompassing dream as a sense of suspicion enveloped Team Radcliffe. Media opportunities were non-existent. </p> <p>Until 2002 Radcliffe used to be an enthusiastic regular on the European grand prix circuit, racing over a variety of distances. But since she has begun concentrating on marathons she has restricted her appearances on track, road or country to a select handful each year. </p> <p>As Radcliffe shattered a world record in each one it appeared that she became more and more strangled by her own expectations and those of others. It was no longer enough for her or her supporters that she should just run well; she should also rewrite the record books. </p> <p>On Sunday it appeared she had forgotten the art of foot racing, as opposed to the time-trialling that she had done in her only three previous marathons, when she had twice broken the world record with the aid of male pacemakers. </p> <p>Most experts agreed that her tactic of not blasting away from the gun on Sunday was a prudent one given the oppressive conditions. But there was widespread bewilderment as to why she insisted on leading the group of runners who gathered at her elbow ready to pounce. </p> <p>\"Why didn't she just cruise along in the middle of the pack?\" asked one former top British international. \"She was easily the fastest 10-kilometres runner in the field. If she had waited until 20 miles and then gone she could still have won. She didn't have to do the work for everyone else.\" </p> <p>Some have also privately questioned whether, for all her meticulous preparation in the areas of science and diet, Radcliffe had paid the course and conditions enough respect. Unlike Mizuki Noguchi, the Japanese winner, Radcliffe had not run the entire 26.2-mile course in one single effort. She had completed parts of the course on different occasions. </p> <p>Others have also doubted if Radcliffe spent enough time training in hot conditions, believing she should have spent more than three weeks in southern Spain. </p> <p>Clearly Radcliffe dropped out for a reason - either medical or psychological - but it would surprise no one if she were to line up for the final of the 10,000m on Friday. But, whatever Radcliffe does, let us hope she soon rediscovers the pleasure the sport once gave her and it ceases to be the unbearable load it appears to have become recently.</p>",
  "<p>After all the talk that cynical terrorists would use the platform of the 2004 Olympic Games to make a crass political statement, it turns out that a cynical president of the United States got in there before them. </p> <p>For the past week the campaign to re-elect George W Bush has been running a television advert in America seeking to attach the US administration's \"war on terrorism\" with the participation of Iraq and Afghanistan in Athens. \"Freedom is spreading through the world like a sunrise,\" intones a portentous narrator as the flags of both countries flutter. \"At this Olympics there will be two more free nations and two less terrorist regimes.\" </p> <p>Cue stirring music, followed by the hard sell: Vote Bush-Cheney. </p> <p>The first temptation is to reach for the TV remote with one hand and the sick bag with the other but, as anyone who has been exposed to American political advertising for any length of time will tell you, subtlety has no place in the emotional vocabulary of the people who put these things together. In any case, the crassness of the script is not the most objectionable aspect of Bush's advert. </p> <p>There are also, for instance, the legal issues involved. According to US federal law, the insignia, images and trademarks of the Olympic Games can only be used for marketing purposes by the International Olympic Committee and national Olympic committees. </p> <p>In America this means that the Olympics belong to the US Olympic Committee - a fact that body's officials pointed out when asked to comment on the advert. Or at least they did until they realised that sticking up for themselves would land them in a fight with an administration which has a history of vindictiveness towards those who stand up to it (as the vicious attacks on John Kerry's war record amply illustrate). Now the committee says it will not make any further comment until its lawyers review the tape of the advert. </p> <p>It doesn't take a Harvard law degree to work out that the USOC will do or say whatever it takes to avoid a confrontation, although it will take a few days to draft a face-saving excuse to back off. While the lawyers are making their money, at least it gives the rest of us time to contemplate the fact that the courage of the Iraqi national football team extends way beyond the touchlines on the football field. </p> <p>Rather than meekly accepting their designated role in Bush's re-election campaign - plucky foreigners saved by political colossus - members of the team reacted furiously when they were told their success had been appropriated by a man whom one player described as a mass-murderer. The team's coach Adnan Hamad yesterday told reporters: \"We do not have freedom in Iraq, we have an occupying force. This is one of our most miserable times. Freedom is just a word for the media.\" </p> <p>No one would deny that Iraq's participation in these games has been welcome but there has been a public relations aspect to it which, frankly, stinks. Under the guidance of a former British army officer called Mark Clark, the team's manager, a daily ration of \"uplifting\" tales about the Iraqi athletes has been gobbled up and regurgitated by unquestioning reporters, especially in the American media. </p> <p>The bravery of these athletes is obvious. But so is the moral of their stories; they would not be here if the allies hadn't toppled Saddam Hussein. Calling George W Bush a mass-murderer does not fit into this comforting narrative. </p> <p>Clark's response was to insult his team's intelligence. \"They are perhaps politically naive,\" he suggested, adding that reporters had taken advantage of them. Sorry, Mr Clark, but perhaps the players are simply grown men who were annoyed to discover that a politician who invaded their country under a false prospectus and reduced much of it to rubble apparently wants to claim their success as his own. </p> <p>Now we hear that George W Bush is thinking about visiting Athens later this week and that, should the Iraqis beat Paraguay in tonight's semi-final, he would like to meet the team at the medal ceremony. </p> <p>Given the Iraqis' comments, that now seems unlikely to happen. But on the off-chance that it does, the IOC might want to extend the podium to accommodate the president. That way Jacques Rogge will be able to present him with a brass medal to go with his brass neck.</p>",
  "<p>As we shuffle through the crowds, down from Irini Metro and on to the concourse that leads to Athens' Olympic Stadium, a familiar figure is mopping his brow, shooting wild, desperate glances and frantically waving a piece of multi-coloured card in the sticky air. </p> <p>A ticket tout from the States, a big guy around 50, he has the bright white hair and deep, nuclear tan of a TV evangelist and that classic summer American look - a short-sleeved checked shirt tucked into ample-belted khaki shorts, adorned with a \"fanny pack\", white sports socks yanked up his shins and pristine running trainers fastened in elaborately big bows, like an infant who has just learnt to tie his laces. </p> <p>We have spoken before because we had spare tickets for Sunday night, tickets we reckoned were the hottest in town but ones that, defeated, we reluctantly, painfully let go for a loss. Curiosity has got the better of us and we want to find out what we could have won. It could be the ultimate act in self-punishment but instead there is a sense of relief: it is not the speedboat. </p> <p>Wrinkled by the sweat that seeps nervously, irritably from his pores, the American is clutching a ticket for the men's 100 metres final. But no one cares. Edgy, simmering, he shoots us a flustered look as we approach and shrieks: \"I can't shift this thing, nobody wants it. This is a disaster.\" </p> <p>All around him others are saying the same thing. I cannot suppress a grin but I feel deflated too. It is the event we were so desperate so see, and so convinced we would miss out on, that we applied three times (which seemed like a good idea until we got 12 tickets), and yet there are seats left and going very cheap. </p> <p>The 100m is the Olympic Games. And you can get in for \u00a325 - less than face value. So where is everyone? What is wrong with them? Why aren't they here? The angry American thinks he knows. </p> <p>\"I'm not being bad about the Greeks,\" he says, being bad about the Greeks, \"but they don't know anything about anything. All the events are empty because of them. And they're boycotting American sports - baseball, tennis . . .\" </p> <p>Tennis, American? We back off uneasily as he starts ranting. \"They're so stupid. We're trying to educate them but they're too damn stupid. That's what we're doing in the Middle East - educating. And these idiots . . . we're sorting out the world, so they boycott everything American. No wonder the Americans don't want to fly.\" </p> <p>\"Well,\" says another tout deadpan, when Mr Angry is out of earshot, \"the Americans don't fly, do they? Unless it's over bloody Baghdad.\" </p> <p>Which is not strictly true but there are certainly fewer people from the US at the Olympics than normal and less Greek interest than was anticipated too - except when their own athletes are competing. </p> <p>The American looks devastated. He cannot even rely on those people we had seen earlier in the week, brandishing handwritten sheets of paper like Blankety Blank panellists, with the same roughly scrawled message: \"I need tickets\". For they too were touts. They offered a pittance and now they are asking for one. </p> <p>A huge, fascinating stock exchange, operating openly in front of security guards, police and Olympic staff, Irini has been frenetic all week, with huge wads of tickets and cash, prices racing round, phones ringing and promises being made and broken. Now it is reaching meltdown. Like my Dad's homemade shelves, the market has crashed spectacularly. It is compelling viewing but best left behind. </p> <p>Inside the stadium, though, the flat feeling and disbelief lingers. The anticipation and excitement we feel does not seem shared. There are empty seats, although not as many as we feared, and a muted, strangely ambivalent atmosphere. Maybe the Olympics are always like this; maybe the telly lied to us. Again. But I cannot help feeling a bit sunk, thinking they are doing something wrong. </p> <p>Like the complete lack of information, for start. It is all about building towards the 100m final, the fastest men on earth. Yet there is no real build-up and the people next to us do not even know that tonight is the 100m. No one said anything. </p> <p>Likewise the rest of us are kept in the dark on everything else. We do not know who won the high jump or the triple jump except that a couple of Swedes have gone bounding down the track in delight. Nothing has appeared on the scoreboard, the competitive edge is sucked out, almost killing an already wounded atmosphere. </p> <p>There is a roar when the Greek woman breaks the Olympic record in the 400m hurdles but little tension and excitement, little noise or applause. The night desperately needs something to get people jumping, excited, to create a real buzz, some noise to drown out the dull, head-numbing hum of the stadium generators. </p> <p>Luckily, someone in the announcer's box has a moment's inspiration, reaches for the CD rack and, just in time, brings the stadium to its feet, hopping and cheering and clapping in time as the athletes step on to the track and join in, grinning. Finally there is anticipation, excitement, atmosphere. Zorba the Greek to the rescue again.</p>",
  "<p>It may well be that four or five of the six team pursuiters who contributed to Britain's silver medal here yesterday turn up for another go in Beijing in four years' time. Rob Hayles, asked what might drive him to keep racing until the age of 35, said simply \"frustration\". That emotion ran deep among the British cyclists yesterday after they finished runners-up for the fourth time in a major title in the last four years. </p> <p>There was no capitulation over the four kilometres and there were no errors, merely gradual submission to inexorable opponents. Steve Cummings, Bradley Wiggins, Hayles and Paul Manning initially matched the Australian quartet of Luke Roberts, Brad McGee, Graeme Brown and Brett Lancaster before the gap opened steadily at a rate of just under a second per kilometre. </p> <p>The absence of suspense, compared with a tight bronze medal ride-off in which Spain defeated Germany, hid the fact that the Britons had gambled on switching to a larger gear, hoping to produce sufficient speed to match the Australians, who had pulverised the world record in the first round on Sunday. Instead of going faster, the quartet struggled, like the driver of a car who finds he is in fifth gear but cannot get his foot down. Their time of 4.01.76sec was more than three seconds down on the Australians. </p> <p>\"We geared up to win, the gear was right for the time we wanted to do but, because we weren't on the time, it felt a bit big,\" said Hayles. \"We scheduled for a 3.57, which was not over-optimistic, but unfortunately the conditions were a bit harder than yesterday, with the wind getting up, and it was cooler as well, and there was no chance of a catch as there was yesterday. </p> <p>\"The first kilometre, the first three laps at least, were good. I thought 'we're on this'. We were up on schedule, it was under control but we went off the pace and, when you slow down a little on a gear like that, you're suffering. It's hard to fight back on a big gear like that.\" </p> <p>The team, and their coach Simon Jones, will have regrets aplenty but there need be no recriminations. \"I'm proud, not gutted,\" said the cycling performance director Dave Brailsford. \"We knew it could backfire but, if we'd been conservative, we would have had silver anyway.\" </p> <p>The frustration, and for the youngest team member Cummings the tears, should not detract from their rapid progress: six years ago, according to Hayles, sixth or seventh place was felt to be an achievement; now silver sticks in the collective craw. </p> <p>Wiggins, if not exactly fresh then still buzzing from his gold medal in the individual event, was the strong man. He started in the difficult No2 slot, behind the starter Paul Manning, facing the task of taking the team up to 40mph from a standing start, and then made the pace for complete laps and on one occasion a lap and a half. </p> <p>It was noticeable that, when he made the running, the deficit on the Australians lessened and, while victory yesterday would have made him the first Briton since the equestrian Richard Meade in 1972 to take two golds in the same games, he will have another chance in tomorrow's two-man madison relay, where he is partnered with Hayles. </p> <p>Brailsford said yesterday that he will attempt to persuade the BOA to appeal for Chris Newton and Bryan Steel to be awarded medals as they rode in qualifying but were not selected in the final. The rules state that only finalists receive medals but in a similar situation in Sydney an appeal resulted in medals for Hayles and Jon Clay. </p> <p>While Newton at least has a strong medal chance in today's men's points race, Steel will retire after these games at the age of 35. Yesterday must have been an anticlimactic end to a career that began when he was a reserve for Seoul in 1988 and which has seen him miss only two world championships in the last 15 years. </p> <p>Yesterday, remaining a team man to the last, he could be seen carrying his mates' bags to the track centre before the event and he stayed to share their pain at least in spirit. \"It was gutting to have to tell those athletes they wouldn't get a medal and I'd like Brian to go out with one,\" said Brailsford. \"He's been one of the most dependable riders we've ever had.\" </p> <p>Although there is delight at the way that Cummings has proved himself equal to the task in the last six months, a replacement for Steel has to be found to keep the squad competitive. While the Australians have seemingly limitless numbers of young cyclists coming through, the talent pool in Britain is smaller and the under-23 ranks will be scoured in the next few months. \"There are lads there but they need guts to be involved,\" said Hayles. \"I hope this inspires some guys.\" </p> <p>The Scot, Ross Edgar, was eliminated in the quarter-final stage of the men's sprint, although he was not initially expected even to ride, let alone get so far, which meant that Victoria Pendleton's win in the ride-off for ninth place in the women's sprint was the only British victory in the velodrome yesterday. Aged 21 and 24 respectively, Edgar and Pendleton will be back and so will the pursuiters, whose shared frustration now spans an entire Olympic cycle.</p>",
  "The search for the reasons behind Paula Radcliffe's disastrous performance in the Olympic marathon moved yesterday to a medical laboratory in Athens, where blood samples taken from the 30-year-old athlete were being analysed in the hope of discovering some medical explanation for the exhaustion that forced her to come to a halt at the side of the road with four miles of the race still to run. <p>Too distressed to utter more than a single word - \"Devastated\" - in the immediate aftermath of her withdrawal, a pale and red-eyed Radcliffe emerged yesterday to give her version of the events that ended the attempt to crown her career with a gold medal. </p> <p>During yesterday's late-afternoon press conference there were signs of the effects of the distress so clearly evident to a worldwide television audience when she abandoned the race. At one point in the questioning she was forced to call a temporary halt to the proceedings while she composed herself. </p> <p>\"Basically I don't have a lot of explanations at this point,\" she said. \"I'm struggling myself to comprehend what happened and find a reason for it. This morning I had some tests done, and I'm still waiting for the results to come through.\" </p> <p>Of all the 271 athletes who arrived in Athens under the banner of the Great Britain team, Radcliffe seemed to many to be the best bet for a gold medal. </p> <p>But the world record holder, who is considering whether to compete in Friday's 10,000m event, confessed yesterday that there had been \"nothing left in her legs\" when an Ethiopian runner, Elfenesh Alemu, overtook her just over two hours into the marathon, with 22 and a half miles run. </p> <p>What she could say was that the conditions had not been to blame, thus confirming the belief of those who thought that mental turmoil, rather than simply a physical toll, had been responsible for her inability to finish the race. </p> <p>The temperature of 35C (95F), the 35% humidity and the relentless, shadeless hills of the 26-mile course had offered nothing unexpected to an athlete whose preparations for this event during the past 18 months had been almost obsessively single-minded. </p> <p>No athlete in the world has spent more time bringing scientific principles to bear on her diet, on her physical conditioning, and on helping her body to recover from the effects of training and competition. In recent weeks she had trained in seclusion in southern Spain, in the sort of environment she knew she would find last weekend on the road between the village of Marathon and the Panathinaiko stadium in Athens. </p> <p>\"They were tough conditions\", she said yesterday, \"but they were tough for everyone. You have to train to cope with that. I'd done that. The conditions were tough, but I didn't finish the race dehydrated or in any sort of distress from the heat. </p> <p>\"I was prepared. I'd prepared for run ning in the heat. I don't feel the heat was a factor. Where we were in Spain, it was as hot, and probably more humid. And I train on hills the whole time. So I can't say it was a lack of preparation. I'm totally devastated, because this is what it had all been about, preparing for this race. To run that badly and not really have a reason for it is hard.\" </p> <p>There had been rumours that she had been seen visiting the clinic of a German sports doctor, Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt, in recent weeks, seeking treatment for a leg injury, but she refused yesterday to advance that as a factor. </p> <p>\"I did have a slight calf niggle four and a bit weeks ago, and I visited Dr Muller-Wohlfahrt's clinic for a check-up,\" she said. \"I've been going there regularly. I missed two days' training then. And last week I had another niggle. Probably that was a stress, so close to the Olympics There was worry there. But I came through that and I was back training and it didn't bother me in the race.\" </p> <p>Other forms of pressure, she conceded, might have played a part. \"I've had pressure before. Yes, there was more pressure this time, but probably the biggest pressure was from myself. You're always going to be more nervous before the Olympics than you are before other races, but I don't think I can use that as an excuse.\" </p> <p>There were certainly no signs of unusual pressure when she took the lead at the start of the race and held it for 15 miles. The difficulties started when Mizuki Noguchi of Japan, the eventual winner, and Alemu, the Ethiopian, broke away from the leading group of 10 runners. </p> <p>\"I felt reasonably good for the first part of the race,\" Radcliffe said. \"I intended putting in some effort on the tougher parts of the hills and the long climb. I felt good on the first couple of hills. </p> <p>\"Then I had stomach problems at 15 kilometres, but I seemed to come through those, and I went through a bad stage when the two girls broke away. I seemed to feel a bit better when I got back into second place. I was trying to stay positive and feeling that the gap, at that stage, wasn't beyond me. I could pull it back if I held it together.\" </p> <p>The big problems came when the race started the long descent to the finish through the suburbs of Athens. She had become so disorientated that she found herself following the double rows of cats' eyes that marked the bus lane, rather than staying in the middle of the road. </p> <p>\"I was going downhill, but I felt like I was going uphill,\" she said. \"I was running at the side of the road, but I was still hitting those bump things. It wasn't like any part of me was hurting. But all of me was, if that makes sense. There wasn't any muscle or anything that seized up. I just couldn't keep going.\" </p> <p>Seeing Alemu go past had been the final blow. \"Emotionally, it kicks you in the guts. It did that when the two girls pulled away, too, but I'd got that back together and come through it. </p> <p>\"Physically, I knew I could do that. If I'd been running strongly when she [Alemu] came by me, I could have regrouped and got through that, too.\" </p> <p>As she stopped and looked back down the road, hands on her knees, her thoughts were divided between carrying on and finding a way of giving up. </p> <p>\"My mind didn't want to let go and give up on it,\" she said. \"There was support there, from people shouting at me to get going. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what the protocol was for just getting out of there.\" </p> <p>She tried to start again, but realised, for the first time in her life, that it was useless. \"You go through bad stages in every race, and definitely in a marathon, but not as bad as that. I've never felt before that I couldn't finish a race.\" </p> <p>Eventually, she was picked up and taken back to the stadium, where she met her husband, Gary Lough, and her parents. \"There's very little anyone can say to comfort you,\" she said. </p> <p>After a doctor had checked her over and could find nothing wrong, she was taken out of the stadium and driven back to the athletes' village. </p> <p>\"I was just in shock,\" she remembered yesterday. \"I was numb.

  "<p>The British sprint manager Shane Sutton, as Aussie as they come, was a little nervous and itching for a cigarette. \"I just want the boys to bring it home tonight. They're not interested in silver. If they don't do it you'll see four devastated blokes.\" </p> <p>And devastated they were. This was fourth time in succession - at the last two world championships, the Commonwealth Games (as England) and now the Olympics - that this men's 4,000m pursuit team had been beaten by the Australian quartet who, like their cricketers, seem to get better and better. </p> <p>Unlike that never-to-be-forgotten day in 1882 when England lost at The Oval, the body of British pursuit cycling has not died in consequence, nor will it be cremated and the ashes taken back to Australia. But, as Rob Hayles observed on behalf of his three colleagues: \"We're starting to get sick of finishing behind them\". </p> <p>Sutton, who hails from the small New South Wales town of Moree, has been living in England for around 20 years and nobody could have been more desperate to see the Aussies lose. He was quietly confident that the tables could be turned and, as would be expected given his roots, had a small, informal, wager on the outcome. \"Well, you've got to have a bit of a gamble,\" he grinned. </p> <p>\"Bugger - silver again\" read an Australian headline after Katie Mactier finished second in the women's individual pursuit on Sunday. Hayles, Steve Cummings, Paul Manning, and Bradley Wiggins would have concurred. </p> <p>The Athens velodrome was not expected to be particularly quick but the heat, coupled with the humidity, appears to have created a microclimate of thin atmosphere akin to riding at altitude. Prior to yesterday, seven world records had been broken, including the Australian pursuit team on Sunday. </p> <p>The Brits knew they would have to be at their absolute best. \"May the best team win,\" was how one British voice greeted Jennie Sheer, an Australian official. \"We will,\" she replied. </p> <p>Tension was high in both camps, heightened by the intense rivalry that always exists on the sporting field between the two nations. The riders' long, tapering, aerodynamic helmets were nervously adjusted and re-adjusted, thighs were slapped and palms wiped. All was fidget and fret as both teams prepared for the start; once on the move all was poetry in motion. </p> <p>There are few more compelling sights in sport than a pursuit quartet in high-gear pomp - wheels within a whisker, tyres gently humming. Such is the expertise that there appears to be no effort being expended at all. It is, of course, a complete illusion. </p> <p>At the first check the Australians were marginally ahead; at the second the Brits had reversed the lead. For a few split seconds hopes leapt, but they were never to be in front again. There were small fluctuations, but finally the gap was more than 3sec. </p> <p>The Australians were way short of beating their own new world record, but the weather was a little cooler and the wind a little more blustery. The Brits had been hoping that the latter might cause the Aussies, who ride exceptionally close together, a few problems. It was not to be. </p> <p>\"You get a dominance in sport like the Australians have against us and you just try to claw your way back,\" said Jones. \"We're getting there, slowly but surely.\" For Jones, read Michael Vaughan. </p> <p>The trouble is, as Hayles pointed out, that the Australians have a conveyor belt of talent in the wings. \"Every junior world championships is full of Australian kids breaking records left, right and centre. And it is not just cycling. Every sport is full of kids. OK, they've got the weather, but all sportsmen are heroes down there, whereas in the UK it seems like it's just the soccer players.\" </p> <p>Silver was not a failure, hardly. It just felt that way. The more so because it was the Aussies above them on the podium once again. Advance Australia Fair? One day they may be rocked back on their heels. Maybe.</p>",
  "In March 1969, after the Czechoslovakian ice hockey team defeated the Soviet Union 2-0, the streets of Prague filled with people chanting at their Soviet occupiers, \"You have tanks, we have goals.\" In such a context, Ivan Hlinka, who has died aged 54, had an importance comparable to that in England of Bobby Moore, Alf Ramsey and Denis Law combined. <p>As an ice hockey player, Hlinka led Czechoslovakia to their first world championship. As a coach, he took the Czech Republic to an Olympic gold medal in Nagano. Later, he became the first European to coach in the north American National Hockey League (NHL). </p> <p>Hlinka died in a car crash while returning to Prague from the spa town of Karlovy Vary, where he had gone to make sure that the Czech star Jaromir Jagr could take part in the World Cup tournament, which begins next Monday. Hlinka's feuding with Jagr was one of the reasons for his dismissal as coach of the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins in 2001. Ironically, Herb Brooks, whom Hlinka succeeded as coach, died last year, also in a car crash (obituary, August 22 2003). </p> <p>Born in Most, near the German border, Hlinka began playing, at the age of 12, with the junior teams of CHZ Litvonov, the hotbed of Czech hockey. He made his senior debut aged 19 in 1969, and, apart from a brief spell with Dukla Trencen, played there until 1981, registering 848 points in 469 games. But his reputation was made as leader of the national team. With Canadian and American professionals barred from competition, \"amateur\" ice hockey was dominated by the Soviets. </p> <p>When the Czechs won their first world championship, in Prague in 1972, it was Hlinka who was credited with convincing his teammates they were capable of winning. He won two more world titles, in 1976 and 1977, but had to settle for Olympic bronze in 1972 and silver in 1976. </p> <p>However, in 1976, Czechoslovakia again shocked the hockey world by reaching the finals of the Canada Cup, the first \"open\" world tournament. Although they lost to the host Canadians 5-4 in the final, Hlinka was named as the tournament's outstanding forward, ahead of Guy LaFleur and Phil Esposito. </p> <p>At 6ft 2in and nearly 16st, Hlinka's style as a centre resembled Esposito's - difficult to move from the slot in front of the goal, although his skating and passing abilities reminded people more of the elegant Montreal Canadian centre Jean Beliveau. </p> <p>A number of Czechs had already played in a rival professional league, but, in 1981, Hlinka, past his prime, became one of the first in the NHL, playing two seasons for Vancouver Canucks; his 60 first-season points remains a team record for a rookie. He played two more seasons in Switzerland, before returning to Litvonov as coach in 1985. He became coach of the national Czech team just as it was weakened by the loss of Slovak players to their own, newly independent country. </p> <p>Hlinka's greatest triumph came in 1998, when, behind the outstanding goaltending of Dominik Hasek, the Czech Republic won in Nagano, the first Olympic tournament completely open to professionals. After coaching the Czech Republic to their second world title in 1999, Hlinka was hired as associate head coach in Pittsburgh by Brooks and general manager Craig Patrick, both of whom had competed against him as US Olympians. </p> <p>After a year understudying Brooks, Hlinka took over the Penguins in 2000, joining Chicago's Finnish coach Alpo Suhonen as the NHL's first European skippers. Boasting 15 European players, his team reached the Stanley Cup semi-finals, but he was fired after losing the first four games of the 2001-02 season. Player-owner Mario Lemieux blamed a lack of communication; Hlinka was unable to get the superstar Jagr to concentrate on playing defence. </p> <p>Hlinka spent two years resting after suffering heart problems, but again was hired by former rivals, spending one season as coach of Avantgard Omsk, in the Russian Premier League. At the 2004 world championships in Prague, he was named as the greatest figure in Czech hockey history. </p> <p>After the Czechs performed badly in that tournament, Hlinka was chosen to replace his former assistant, Slavimir Lener, as coach. With Hlinka's death, Vladimir Ruzicka, captain of the 1998 Olympic champions, is expected to take over. But no one can replace Hlinka's standing in the hearts of Czechs. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Libena and a son. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ivan Hlinka, hockey player and coach, born January 26 1950; died August 16 2004</p>",
  "<p>Seven years after Kelly Holmes feared her career was over on this track, she disbelievingly pulled off the most improbable victory of her life to claim the Olympic 800 metres gold medal here last night. </p> <p>The 34-year-old Kent woman who decided to compete in this event only two weeks ago ran a textbook tactical race to hold off three challengers, including Mozambique's defending champion Maria Mutola, in a desperate finish. </p> <p>It brought her the reward she has surely deserved during a career marked by so many ups and downs. </p> <p>Holmes's face first burst into an explosion of joy when she crossed the line. Then there was the horrible realisation it may not be true. Her worst fears must have been exaggerated by the fact that it took officials nearly a minute to confirm the result. </p> <p>Then when \"1..Kelly Holmes\" flashed up on the scoreboard the grin briefly returned before another sense of disbelief at becoming the first British woman to win an Olympic title on the track since Sally Gunnell in 1992 washed over her. </p> <p>\"I can't believe it,\" said Holmes, who gave her first interview as Olympic champion to Gunnell, now working for BBC. </p> <p>\"I didn't realise I had won and had to see the replay twice to be sure. I saw the line coming and coming and I fought for it. I held on for dear life. </p> <p>\"I have had all those dreams and I thought everything was going too good this time and I thought it would go again, but I came through.\" </p> <p>Holmes is the first British 800m runner to win an Olympic title since Steve Ovett in 1980 and the first woman since Ann Packer in Tokyo 40 years ago. </p> <p>\"I just wanted to see the replay to be sure,\" she said. \"I couldn't believe it. It was unreal. Someone told me at the side of the track that I'd won and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.\" </p> <p>Holmes has overcome extra ordinary odds to do the unthinkable on so many times it has ceased to be remarkable. But the former army sergeant experienced the lowest point of her career in this stadium in 1997. </p> <p>Then she had been among the shortest-priced favourite for any event in the world championships but saw her hopes dashed in the 1500m on the first lap of the first round with an Achilles injury. It was one of several occasions she was advised that her career may be finished. </p> <p>The traumatic memory of that incident had cast a pall over her preparation for these games and was at first unwilling to risk injuring herself by running both the 800m and 1500m here. </p> <p>\"It was always a risk doubling up,\" said Holmes. \"But I figured that I was in such good condition it was worth giving it a go.\" </p> <p>Bookmakers last night made Holmes 5-2 to become the first British runner since Albert Hill in 1920 to complete the double by also winning the 1500m. </p> <p>Holmes received her gold medal from Sebastian Coe, the former men's world record holder, who twice came close to repeating that double in 1980 and 1984. </p> <p>There will be no time for Holmes to celebrate. She is due on the track again this evening to run in the first round of the 1500m. \"I don't know what state I'll be in tomorrow but I'll be there,\" she said. </p> <p>The last time Holmes had attempted the Olympic double was in Atlanta eight years ago when she had finished fourth in the 800m and 11th in the 1500m. </p> <p>There she had been suffering a stress fracture and was so disillusioned she threw her spikes in a bin at the end of the games. She had vowed never to watch a video of those races until she won a gold medal. </p> <p>What Holmes achieved here surpassed even what she did in the Sydney Olympics four years ago. Then a scan revealed how she had a 12-centimetre tear in her calf muscle. </p> <p>She returned to the track only seven weeks before Sydney and went to the games more in hope than expectation, but ended up with a bronze medal. </p> <p>This time, fitter and stronger, Holmes could afford to be bolder. When the gun went she dropped to the back of the field tracking Mutola, the runner she shares a coach with in the American Margo Jennings. </p> <p>It appeared a risky tactic as the American Jearl Miles Clark set a fast tempo at the front. Even at the bell Holmes was still only in seventh. Then, when Mutola began to accelerate through the field, Holmes was at her elbow. </p> <p>At the same place she had kicked in Sydney Holmes was shoulder to shoulder with Mutola. The two were battling down the home straight in a titanic struggle but, whereas Holmes has buckled so often in the past, this time she discovered extra strength. </p> <p>When the rush of bodies arrived on her shoulder as the line loomed, Holmes thrust herself forward with one final effort that transported her into history by claiming victory in 1min 56.38sec. </p> <p>\"I kept to my race plan which was to stay back as long as possible and then I knew the last 150m had to be all out and I decided to go for it,\" Holmes said. \"I have more strength than speed but I had to risk staying back.\" </p> <p>It was only the second defeat in 39 races for Mutola, a period stretching back more than two years. </p> <p>Nearly as shocked as Holmes when she saw the scoreboard was Mutola, run out of the medals by Morocco's Hasna Benhassi and Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak. Nearly . . . but not quite.</p>",
  "The smiling man in the FBI wanted poster is Howard Welsh, and more than 1,000 investors in his religion-themed investment scam are very keen to hear from him. <p>But any prayers that the Liverpool-born fugitive might rematerialise with their money have so far gone unheeded. </p> <p>The 61-year-old is accused of defrauding investors out of almost \u00a316m with a \"divinely inspired\" scheme he started five years ago in the US. </p> <p>Mr Welsh, who allegedly set up the scam in the east coast tourist city of Virginia Beach, Virginia, disappeared from there before charges were filed at the US district court last summer. </p> <p>This month a report cited an FBI source as saying he could be hiding in Britain. </p> <p>Before setting up the Living Your Sole Purpose investment plan, Mr Welsh had reportedly tried selling a \"magical elixir\". </p> <p>The FBI says one of his investors has lost \u00a34m. </p> <p>Mr Welsh found deeply religious people, many of them groups of families, and tried to appeal to their faith, telling them they should not fear he would run away with their money because if they had faith their deposits would triple. </p> <p>His victims include hundreds of Americans and some Britons targeted through word of mouth, fliers, seminars in several states, and email. </p> <p>The scheme had a religious, self-improvement bent but has not improved many investors' lives. Fewer than 5% saw any returns on their money. </p> <p><b>Co-accused</b><br> </p> <p>Wherever he is, Mr Welsh is likely to be with his co-accused, his American girlfriend, Lee-Hope Thrasher, 51. A graduate from a well-off family, she was working for victims of crime when she met the Liverpudlian in 1997 through a mutual friend. </p> <p>They set up the investment plan in 1999 and ran it until earlier this year. </p> <p>The FBI say it was a suspected Ponzi fraud, named after Carl Ponzi, a conman who attracted investors with promises of quick, high returns in Boston in the 20s. </p> <p>It works by paying back some investors early on to create a buzz and lure more money in. </p> <p>Mr Welsh and Ms Thrasher called it a \"corporation sole\" scheme, normally tightly regulated tax-free investments used by churches and often linked to a specific \"mission\". </p> <p>US court records show the couple opened bank accounts in the name of a non-profit entity called Dominion of Heaven on Planet Earth. </p> <p>One of their promotional fliers said: \"Some people will say, 'If this is not a business what tells me that they won't take my money and run? I would say, 'Do you have enough faith to see this through for a year?' </p> <p>\"If your answer is 'yes' then you will see your deposits triple.\" </p> <p>On its website the FBI says that to make the schemes look legitimate \"the victims were required to attend three-day training seminars held throughout the US. The theme of these seminars was deeply religious.\" </p> <p>Some investors had to pay more than \u00a31,000 to register with the scheme. They were promised they could make more than \u00a31m on an investment of around \u00a31,200 over six years. </p> <p>A bank became suspicious in 2001 when a large sum was transferred from a Washington account of Dominion of Heaven on Planet Earth and wired to Hong Kong. </p> <p>Authorities then began to discover the scope of the alleged money laundering conspiracy. Charges filed at the US district court show that money was wired to 13 different countries, including Switzerland, Nigeria, China, Lebanon and France. One of Mr Welsh's mailing addresses for the scheme was in the Bahamas. </p> <p>Mr Welsh is something of a man of mystery, who is believed to have moved to the US several years ago. Friends of Ms Thrasher told the local Virginia Pilot newspaper he was divorced and had children in Washington state. </p> <p>They said he had variously claimed to have worked in manufacturing, the oil-spill clean-up industry, water purification, real estate and investment planning. </p> <p><b> Distraught</b><br> </p> <p>Ms Thrasher's family are distraught that she fell in with Mr Welsh. After being traumatised by a burglary in 1975, she worked for more than a decade helping victims of crime before, they say, he led her astray. </p> <p>Her father Harold, 82, one of the investors in the scam, said Mr Welsh had been the driving force. He told the Virginia Pilot: \"She didn't seem to have the knowledge how he was going to make the money and how he was going to pay these people I think she's strictly under his control.\" </p> <p>In an indication, perhaps, of Mr Welsh's charisma, some of those who invested are said to be still hopeful they will see a return. </p> <p>The US media reported that an investor had received an email believed to be from Ms Thrasher after the couple disappeared, saying: \"We feel very good about everything so just take deep breaths with us and be surrounded by God's brilliant white light.\" </p> <p>The FBI's wanted notices say Mr Welsh might still have contacts in the UK, but the truth is he could be anywhere in the world. </p> <p>While on the run he has been in South America and Africa, and was last seen in Belgium in the spring of 2003, where he received medical treatment for a broken leg after being in a road accident. </p> <p>The FBI lost trace of him there and contacted Interpol, who alerted member countries. </p> <p>Mr Welsh may be using an alias, and is known to have used the name Albert D White for some bank accounts. </p> <p>The Guardian contacted the FBI, Virginia Beach police, Merseyside police, Scotland Yard, Interpol, the National Crime Squad and the National Criminal Intelligence Service but none would comment on the case. </p> <p>Speaking generally, all an FBI spokesman would say was: \"We are seeing more religious investment frauds and those that use the internet are on the rise.\"</p>"
