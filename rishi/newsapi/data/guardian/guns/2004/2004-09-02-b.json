  "Slobodan Milosevic is refusing to take the medicine prescribed for his high blood pressure by UN doctors at his cell, jeopardising his trial for war crimes in what prosecutors said yesterday was a calculated attempt to delay the trial still further. <p>Two independent and confidential medical reports also found that Mr Milosevic, unknown to those treating him, was taking another, unprescribed drug. They concluded he was not fit to conduct his own defence.</p> <p>In an outburst at the close of the hearing at the war crimes tribunal in the Hague, Mr Milosevic also complained that he had recently been served the wrong food at his detention unit at Scheveningen outside the Hague - food apparently intended for a fellow inmate.</p> <p>Long-term observers of the tribunal speculated whether Mr Milosevic, who turned 63 last month, was becoming paranoid after more than three years in custody on charges of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.</p> <p>Mr Milosevic waited until the close of the hearing yesterday to accuse a heart specialist who provided independent medical expertise on his condition of being a Nato stooge and demanding a new check-up from friendly doctors from Serbia, Russia and Greece.</p> <p>The prosecution denounced the demand as another ploy to waste the court's time, but it appeared that the judges might grant Mr Milosevic a further week to submit medical evidence.</p> <p>The medical reports said Mr Milosevic was refusing to take pills prescribed for hypertension, but was taking pills obtained elsewhere to relieve stress.</p> <p>Mr Milosevic reacted angrily to the discussion. \"I take my medication in the presence of guards and the guard writes down the exact time I ingested those medicines,\" he said.</p> <p>But he added that the pills were causing unpleasant side-effects. He had discussed the problem with his Serbian doctor and decided to change the medicine.</p> <p>\"He's playing with his medicines to avoid coming to court,\" said Florence Hartmann, a spokeswoman for the prosecution.</p> <p>The three-judge panel in the case is considering whether to compel Mr Milosevic to accept a defence team and appeared poised to order that yesterday when the row over the accused's tablets, conduct, and legal rights erupted, threatening to delay further a 30-month trial.</p> <p>The judges are to rule today whether Mr Milosevic is to be forced to use defence lawyers. A compromise appeared in the offing for a \"standby lawyer\" to conduct the defence when the accused was sick or when delegated by Mr Milosevic.</p> <p>But Mr Milosevic could still refuse all cooperation with a defence team \"assigned\" by the judges. \"I won't have my right to defend myself diminished. I will never waive that,\" he vowed yesterday after opening his defence on Tuesday.</p>",
  "I always know there has been a terrorist incident in southern Israel when the helicopters start arriving at the regional hospital opposite my place of work. This time I didn't need to wait for the helicopters: Tuesday's suicide bombs exploded near enough for me and my colleagues at Ben Gurion university to be shaken by the blast. <p>It was closer to home in another sense: we were all aware that it could have been any one of us on those buses, popping out of our office to go shopping. And given that it was the last day of the holidays before the country's schoolchildren returned to their desks, we were all worried that maybe, just maybe, one of them was on those buses. </p> <p>Family and colleagues immediately got in touch,as did the foreign correspondents wanting to know more about this place which has, until now, been well off the map of terrorism. Beersheba, the normally peaceful regional capital of the Negev in the south of the country, has finally made it into the international headlines. </p> <p>Beersheba is almost equidistant between the Gaza Strip and the southern section of the West Bank, approximately 20 minutes' drive from each. In the past, when cheap Palestinian labour used to flood into Israel from the occupied territories, it was a place where the two groups of Palestinians met, exchanged information and disseminated their fight for independence from one territory to the other. But those days have long since ceased: today there is no more than a trickle of Palestinians allowed into Israel by the authorities. </p> <p>Israeli rightwingers, who oppose Ariel Sharon's Gaza disengagement plan, have used Tuesday's attacks as another reason not to go ahead, arguing that to disengage from Gaza would be equivalent to rewarding the terrorists. The fact that the suicide bombers did not come from Gaza, but from the Hebron region in the West Bank, is irrelevant to them. Any act of terrorism is, they say, an indication that territorial withdrawal will not bring an end to violence. And when the incident takes place in a major town so close to the Gaza Strip, this argument is strengthened. </p> <p>The lull in bombings over the past six months has been taken by most Israelis as proof that the security wall has served its professed purpose: keeping the bombers out of Israel. The proponents of the wall, which is still being built even though the international court of justice has ruled it illegal, point to the Beersheba bombings as further proof of its value. Why, they ask, did terrorism move southwards this week? Because, they answer, this is the only region where suicide bombers can still cross with relative ease from the West Bank into Israel. </p> <p>If anything, Tuesday's bombings will serve to speed up Israeli plans for the wall. It was reported on Ynet, the Israeli internet news channel, that Sharon undertook a tour of the southern parts of the West Bank last week to push ahead with the construction of the wall in this region, now that it has been completed elsewhere. When construction does go ahead, it will more closely follow the course of the green line. The few Israeli settlements there are more isolated and would not necessitate a rerouting of the border, as elsewhere. </p> <p>The idea that the wall - and only the wall - has brought about the lull in bombings is far too simplistic. There are a host of other reasons. International pressure on Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to take a firmer hold of fundamentalist groups is of great importance. So, too, has been the impact of Israel's hardline military operations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which have destroyed much of the military and civilian infrastructure, so much so that the situation for Palestinians is worse than at any time since 1967. </p> <p>Not that that makes much difference to some Israeli policymakers, who immediately after the bombings accused the Palestinian Authority of not doing enough to rein in the terrorists. The Israeli government is intent on discrediting Arafat, who is therefore linked to every outrage despite the fact that his declining authority has left him with little control over Hamas and Jihad elements. </p> <p>According to the biblical narrative, Beersheba was the home of Abraham, the common father to both Judaism and Islam. His name is often used to promote it as a city of peace and dialogue between the two peoples. But this week it became a city of violence and blood. It reminded the residents of this outlying town that the conflict does not bypass anyone. Hopefully, when the immediate - and understandable - emotional reaction has passed, it will remind us that peace, if it ever comes, will be for the benefit of all - not just the residents of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Newman is professor of political geography at Ben Gurion University of the Negev </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:newman@bgumail.bgu.ac.il\">newman@bgumail.bgu.ac.il</a></p>",
  "Dangerous confusion threatened the Republicans on the second day of their convention. In an interview on the NBC Today Show, President Bush was deferentially asked about the war on terrorism. \"I don't think you can win it,\" he replied. For hours afterwards, his campaign issued bulletins to say he hadn't meant it. <p>Finally, appearing before the American Legion veterans in Nashville, Bush declared: \"We will win.\" </p> <p>Vice-President Dick Cheney helpfully explained: \"The president certainly never intended to convey the notion that we can't win.\" </p> <p>By breaking his own iron law - \"I don't do nuance\" - Bush had blurred himself into the negative image of John Kerry as a flip-flopper. </p> <p>Nuance leads to ambivalence, which can lead to inaction; and who then can be an action hero? </p> <p>Bush's mistaken nuance set the stage for the larger-than-life persona of Conan the Barbarian, Predator, The Terminator, Commando, and, not least, Kindergarten Cop. \"This is like winning an Oscar, as if I would know,\" said Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California. </p> <p>Schwarzenegger is the only political figure in America who is married to the Kennedys and is an old Bush family retainer. His ability to operate in several dimensions at once is intrinsic to his rise. In 1988 he campaigned for the elder Bush. \"They call me The Terminator, but, when it comes to America's future, Michael Dukakis is the real Terminator,\" he said. </p> <p>For that he was made the president's fitness adviser and appeared at the White House to direct Colin Powell (then General Powell) in push-ups on the South Lawn. </p> <p>Schwarzenegger's policies as governor- pro-gay, pro-choice, pro-environmental - have little in common with Bush's, and he has no chance of carrying his state for Bush. As a principal speaker on \"People of Compassion\" night, his role as supporting actor was to transfer his image to Bush and the party. </p> <p>Arnold has an aesthetic sense that passes over the heads of the Republicans. No matter how scripted he may be, he remains pure in his underlying message. He makes the case for the narcissism of power through the power of narcissism. </p> <p>No one is more narcissistic than the body builder. He builds his reputation standing before mirrors. </p> <p>Schwarzenegger offered the Republican convention totemic worship of virility borne out of fear of its fading. It was an act he has been perfecting for decades. In its essence, he offered a sexual identity panic speech. </p> <p>He told of being a \"once scrawny\" boy in Austria daydreaming about becoming an American, inspired by John Wayne movies. In 1968 he arrived, during a presidential campaign. \"Listening to Nixon speak ... I said to my friend, 'What party is he?' 'He's a Republican.' I said: 'Then I'm a Republican.'\" </p> <p>He offered the flattery of the immigrant to the native: \"Everything I have, my career, my success, my family, I owe to America.\" </p> <p>Having established his citizenship, Schwarzenegger felt entitled to articulate the Republican credo - power over weakness. \"If you believe this country, not the UN, is the best hope for democracy, then you are a Republican.\" Thus the immigrant blasted internationalism. </p> <p>\"If you believe that we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism, then you are a Republican.\" Thus the Democrats were soft. </p> <p>\"And to those critics who are so pessimistic about our economy, I say: Don't be economic girlie-men.\" \"Girlie-man\" is a peculiar accusation. It reveals fear of women and their complex values. The name-calling is a frantic effort to suppress nuance, which the action hero fears he may harbour within. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal is a former senior adviser to Bill Clinton, and the Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "According to yet another of the surveys that now punctuate our lives, 39% of Americans say their sexual behaviour is influenced by religion, compared with 16% in Britain and a paltry 3% in France. I am not quite sure what this means. Most people would assume that religious people are rather more chaste than the world as a whole, and that may well be true. And yet - like the things that you're \"li'ble to read in the Bible\", as listed in Porgy and Bess - it ain't necessarily so. So much is clear from the scandals reported from time to time from the US featuring charismatic preachers who, when female followers under their spell throw themselves at them, can't always resist the temptation to catch. Leaders of mystical movements emanating from the east are not always impervious either. <p>The histories of heretical sects suggest that this has a long provenance. Those given to promiscuity tend to fall into one of two categories. There are those where free love, as it used to be called, is advocated as something which all should embrace; and those who enjoin restraint but don't feel their teachings apply to themselves. </p> <p>The patron saint of the former group is probably Pierre Clergue, priest of Montaillou, whose exploits are chronicled in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's classic account of events in a village in Languedoc where the Cathar heresy still flourished in the 14th century. This ram of a rector helped himself to a large proportion of the women of Montaillou, not excluding his sisters and sisters-in-law, sometimes even in church. Most appear to have succumbed quite happily, but where he encountered resistance, he sometimes found it useful to mention the Inquisition. </p> <p>Some feared that giving into him might be sinful, but Pierre had arguments ready to dispose of such qualms. Yes, such behaviour might be sinful, he told one married woman, but it was a greater sin for women to have intercourse with their husbands, since then they would not be conscious that they were sinning. One woman whom Pierre had seduced when she was only 15 defended her conduct in terms he had no doubt taught her: a woman who slept with a true lover was purified of all sins, she maintained, since the joy of love made the act innocent, proceeding as it did from a pure heart. </p> <p>There is more, much more, of the same in a wonderful book by Norman Cohn, first published almost 50 years ago, called The Pursuit of the Millennium. Some Free Spirit heretics of the 13th century argued that since they were full of the holy spirit, this made them free from sin, and therefore nothing they wanted to do could be sinful. Others who belonged to this tendency liked to claim that since repentance was one of the highest goods, one ought to do things one could then repent of. But Cohn's book is full of figures who belong to the other category, too: those whose watchword seems to have been: don't do as I do, just do as I say. </p> <p>Tanchelm of Antwerp was said to have taught that since he was God incarnate, intercourse with him became a spiritual act. (Court reports suggest that similar doctrines were still being peddled by some naughty priests in 20th-century Britain.) </p> <p>The most spectacular of such practitioners was the 16th-century Anabaptist John of Leyden, born Jan Bockelson, \"a man of extraordinary good looks and an irresistible eloquence\" who became the movement's leader in M\u00fcnster. Having taken 15 wives himself, almost all of them under 20, he annulled the rule that a man must cleave to one woman on pain of death and announced that the men who followed him might marry as many wives as they wished. This licence was not extended to women. Such adherents as dared to question his ruling were executed. But in other respects it was one law for John and his entourage and another for everyone else. Where his court (he had made himself king) dressed in high ostentation, the rule for everyone else was austerity. This, he explained, was because he was dead to the world, so what in anyone else would be sinful vanity could not harm him. When his kingdom was later blockaded by the bishop, his followers were kept on rations so that all the available food could go to his court. </p> <p>It's too easy to write off such prophets as spectacular hypocrites. \"Like many other propheta from Tanchelm onwards,\" says Cohn, \"Bockelson seems to have been a megalomaniac, whose behaviour cannot be adequately interpreted as sincere fanaticism or simply as calculating hypocrisy\". </p> <p>As reading of modern newspapers shows, the conviction that \"if I do it, it must be right\" is still very much with us today. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:McElsewhere@aol.com\">McElsewhere@aol.com</a></p>",
  "There are seminal moments that decide the course of your life. For me, one such was the occasion my wife, Val, decided, \"We need a big vision!\" after my accident in Bolivia. I suppose a precursor of that decision was her insistence, \"Don't you bloody well die on me,\" but that could have been a matter of selfishness or one of desperation that our son Barney would be without a father. Certainly, the doctor escorting us home told her, \"Before long you will wish he had died.\" Only 10 or 15 years ago most people with my level of spinal injury and paralysis did. <p>The big vision meant we were going to have enough money to live decently, she would not allow my injury to cramp our days nor dull my mind, and that Barney's teenage years were going to be \"normal\". In fact, they turned out better than that; he has been able to enjoy every licit and illicit part of the four years since and looks forward to the future with a bubbling impatience. </p> <p>My older daughters, Keira (who fought with the insurance company to get me home) and Beth (who was in the middle of her finals when she heard of my accident), can now pursue their careers without worrying too much about me - Keira as a solicitor buying and selling frightening amounts of commercial property and Beth as a Harvard scientist developing nano-bots in the hope of turning Prince Charles to grey goo or maybe doing something in quantum computing (she can't tell me, it's all hush-hush). </p> <p>Living up to the vision isn't easy and particularly wasn't in the first couple of years when Val struggled to put together the basics of our life; a change of house, installation of a lift and a hoist, the construction of a ramp to give me access to the street and the endless, dispiriting negotiations over the provision of my care with a bureaucracy that, whatever liberal \"mission statement\" it had emblazoned on its letterhead, seemed designed only to save money. </p> <p>For a couple of years she had sacrificed her identity to preserve mine and had to struggle through claustrophobia to regain some of her independence, encouraging me to do the same. I suspect when couples try to \"share\" a spinal injury, they either sink into depression or end up flying apart. We can now more easily choose when, and when not, to be together, just like other people, which is liberating. We still have bad days - but who doesn't? </p> <p>Of course, survival stories abound in the spinal injury community. You read in Forward, the journal of the Spinal Injuries Association, of people skydiving, canoeing, skiing, driving quad bikes with head controls (something I intend to try myself), and the uncomplaining, daily problem-solving, and realise how much tenacious spirit there is out there. None the less, there are still too many living a life bounded by four walls and a television. </p> <p>Most of the things we do are quite commonplace but always involve more forward planning than you could imagine. Like going to the cinema, the theatre, out to dinner, even to the pub. More elaborate preparations have to be made when I decide I want to \"take a walk\" in the countryside. Say I fancy going to Curbar Edge. First, check access with the Peak Park planning board. Next assemble a tribe of robust wheelchair pushers, lifters and bumpers to trundle me along the uneven path by the gritstone edge and through gates not designed with wheelchairs in mind. </p> <p>We booked a holiday in Portugal without having the faintest idea how I would even get into an aeroplane. (By way of a draughty luggage lift in the driving rain, then transfer to an ultra-narrow wheelchair to get into the aircraft where I was liftedby two hefty blokes, hopping from one seat to the next until plonked in the middle. In Portugal the two blokes were pretty weedy, and did not impart much confidence.) </p> <p>We thought we might be limited to lounging around in the sunshine but in fact toured the entire Algarve, mountains and seashore, scrambling over rocky sand dunes to the cliff edge overlooking the Atlantic. </p> <p>So now I have to write my column and write a book or two, no slacking allowed, plan my share of the meals, instructing those of the PAs who can't cook, do some of the shopping (with a trolley attached to the front of the wheelchair making it behave like an articulated lorry. I'm going to try it online), and look after the household accounts. In fact, be a partner, or else. Bloody visions never give you a moment's rest!</p>",

  "For the second time in a week, Vladimir Putin was forced to interrupt his Black Sea holiday yesterday and rush back to Moscow to deal with a horrifying terrorist outrage linked to the crisis in Chechnya. <p>Like last week's bombing of two Russian passenger airliners, the school hostage siege in North Ossetia caught the Russian president on the hop. It follows closely on the heels of Tuesday's suicide bombing in Moscow and a string of other incidents in Chechnya and Ingushetia. </p> <p>This dramatic surge in Chechen separatist violence threatens to draw Mr Putin into what could become, in effect, a third Chechen war - with the alarming possibility of a wider Caucasus conflagration. </p> <p>His predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, miserably failed to suppress Chechen nationalism through military intervention from 1994-96. Three years later, Mr Putin, then prime minister, plunged into a second conflict which he used to boost his presidential credentials. </p> <p>Mr Putin declared victory in early 2000 and again in mid-2002 - but like President George Bush, who prematurely announced \"mission accomplished\" in Iraq, Mr Putin has been repeatedly made to look weak and foolish by the Chechen rebels. </p> <p>That is a dangerous way to treat the former KGB hard man and judo fan. Even at the best of times, Mr Putin's tolerance for opposition or dissent is limited. If provoked, he hits back. Yet now, despite his hurried return to base, it is unclear what he can do beyond resolving the immediate crisis in North Ossetia. Mr Putin refuses to countenance negotiations in Chechnya; the use of force has demonstrably failed; and his political machinations, including last weekend's bogus presidential election to replace an assassinated pro-Moscow placeman, are counterproductive. </p> <p>In July, in apparent exasperation, Mr Putin sacked three of Russia's most senior generals, including Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the general staff, over the setbacks in Chechnya. But this has simply led to the Kremlin being more intimately associated with continuing humiliations in the region. </p> <p>Considered more broadly, the overall authority of a man whose approach to governance is increasingly authoritarian is under challenge on a range of fronts and not just in the Caucasus. </p> <p>Mr Putin won a second term by a landslide last March, largely by denying media access to rival candidates. His message was that he alone could provide Russians with security and stability after the chaos of the post-Soviet Yeltsin era. Above all, Mr Putin presents himself as a safe pair of hands. </p> <p>But there have been several fumbles of late. Terrorism apart, Mr Putin has faced unusually vehement public protests since March over cuts in longstanding social benefits, including housing subsidies, free public transport and prescriptions. </p> <p>His stated aim of doubling Russia's GDP has begun to look as far-fetched as his claim to have whipped the Chechens. Amid open cabinet bickering, his finance minister, Aleksei Kudrin, complained recently that economic reforms have been \"screwed up\". And then there is the Kremlin's long-running, destabilising vendetta with Yukos Oil. </p> <p>While Mr Putin's strongman image may be wearing thin at home, foreign criticism is also on the increase. </p> <p>In an open letter to President Jacques Chirac of France and the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, last month ahead of their talks with Mr Putin, Human Rights Watch deplored abuses of press and academic freedoms in Russia and attacks on non-governmental organisations. </p> <p>It also urged France and Germany to act over Mr Putin's \"failure to establish a meaningful accountability process for crimes committed by Russian soldiers and police forces [in Chechnya]... enforced disappearances, summary executions, and torture have grossly undermined trust in Russian state institutions among ordinary Chechens.\" This caused people such as last week's \"black widow\" plane bombers to resort to violence, it suggested. </p> <p>According to Amnesty International, \"Russian security forces continue to enjoy almost total impunity for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Chechnya\". Continuing excesses by Chechen fighters, like the Ossetia siege, were also strongly condemned. </p> <p>In truth, it sometimes seems that the only people not criticising Mr Putin these days are western governments. Mr Chirac and Mr Schr\u00f6der endorsed Sunday's sham election and sidestepped human rights issues. The Foreign Office, like the US state department, sticks to cautious formulas expressing \"concern\" and fond hopes for better, more democratic days. </p> <p>This attitude has many explanations. Among them is the fact that the US wants Russian support for its own \"war on terror\", so a blind eye is turned in Chechnya. Another reason is the US-British requirement for Moscow's acquiescence over Iraq (and Palestine). And then there is oil. </p> <p>Russia is an energy giant whose importance as a global supplier is increasing rapidly. It is the world's largest exporter of natural gas and second largest exporter of oil after Saudi Arabia. Put crudely, the west needs Russia. And it believes Mr Putin can deliver. End of story.</p>",

This is a pity because Hodson is stuck in Terre Haute, Indiana, with a skirt problem on Wings of the Dawn, the customised two-ton Griffon 450 TD Mk II hovercraft he is driving across the US. Making the longest hovercraft trip in history should provide lots of things to write about, but the entry for August 18 has just three words: \"Replacing skirt segments\", and a photo. Worse, his online journal had no entries from May 3 to August 17, and the photo gallery has only four images in total. Hodson would have generated more interest if, instead of having a proper website, he'd used a camera phone and signed up with Blogger. &lt;BR <a href=\"http://www.hover-adventure.com \">www.hover-adventure.com</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.griffonhovercraft.com\">www.griffonhovercraft.com</a> <br> <a href=\"http://bdb.co.za/shackle/articles/hovercraft.htm\">http://bdb.co.za/shackle/articles/hovercraft.htm</a></p> <p><strong> Rent a peasant </strong><br> \"Rent A Peasant is primarily an association of two people.

While awaiting clearance from the Treasury on a licensing deal with Microsoft for Windows, the NHS has purchased 5,000 licences for Sun Microsystems' Java Desktop System (JDS). This includes the Gnome desktop environment, Sun's StarOffice office suite, Ximian's Evolution email and calendaring application, and the Mozilla web browser. It is paying Sun on a subscription basis, which covers the elements that are not open source, and includes indemnification against possible legal problems. Licensing JDS does not mean the NHS is rushing into open source software, but is taking a chance to evaluate alternatives to Microsoft.  <a href=\"http://wwws.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/\">wwws.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem</a> </p> <p><strong> Wi-Jack</strong><br> Aruba Wireless Networks has launched the Wi-Jack (right), which it claims is \"the world's first centrally configured, wall mounted Wi-Fi outlet\".

Aruba reckons it reduces the cost of deploying a wireless access point from \u00a3550-1,700 to less than \u00a3170.

The students are developing a system to measure the time taken for Bluetooth signals to pass from one device to another. A central tracking console is used to sound an alarm if the time interval changes, indicating that a device has been moved. By mapping and triangulating the signals, the police feel the system would be able to detect and, therefore, deter thefts of equipment from building sites, offices and warehouses. The system could also be used to locate fire fighters in smoky buildings.  <a href=\"http://reporter.leeds.ac.uk/ 500/s10.htm\">http://www.arubanetworks.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Higher Wi-Fi</strong><br> Intel has extended the capabilities of its Centrino wireless system for notebook computers with a tri-mode wireless chip that supports the 802.11 a, b and g network standards.

  "<p>As email becomes more important, and more and more messages arrive in our inboxes, it is getting harder to manage the flood. For many business users, that means a daily struggle with Outlook, the personal information manager that comes as part of Microsoft Office. But remember, it's not just a program, it's a platform: its failings are an invitation for third parties to add enhancements and plug the gaps. </p> <p>For example, Outlook 2003 has Search Folders that let you set up rules for classifying messages without actually moving them out of your inbox, so one piece of email can show up in as many Search Folders as you want. That's useful, but Outlook doesn't keep the contents of all your search folders up to date: if you haven't looked at a Search Folder in a while, you have to wait for Outlook to find the relevant items, and its search is pretty slow. </p> <p>The solution is to use the Lookout add-in instead. It takes about half an hour to build an index and then produces results so fast it's like having a virtual folder. It can also search documents on your hard drive, attachments, contacts, tasks, notes and calendar appointments as well as messages. After you install it, pick Options from the Lookout toolbar, then choose which email folders and document directories you want to index: that can include mapped drives on your network, too. </p> <p>With Lookout, you can sort the search results by date, folder, size, sender, recipient, subject, file type, or how good a match it is. You can restrict results to emails, contacts or files or pick only messages with attachments. For more complicated searches and filters, there's a dialog box that lets you build a query based on any field in the message. </p> <p>Lookout - based on open source technology from the Apache web server project - is so good that Microsoft bought the company. It is now expected to contribute to MSN Search, and there are rumours it will be combined with search technology developed by Microsoft Research to provide the fast email and document searching promised for the next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn. You can download Lookout now, and it's free. </p> <p>Confusingly, there's another Outlook add-on called LookOut!, which you have to pay for. It lets you match incoming emails to a database of contacts (as long as they're stored in Microsoft Access or SQL Server). You can see whatever ID you've assigned to a contact inside Outlook, so it's obvious when you get urgent email from a key client. You can also spot email from co-workers or people who aren't in your database, and who might, therefore, be potential customers. </p> <p>LookOut! also monitors outgoing messages, so you can use it to check you're not making embarrassing mistakes. For example, if you've received a blind carbon copy (bcc:) of an email, only the sender knows you've seen it, but if you use Reply to All, it's obvious you got a secret copy. LookOut! will warn you if you use Reply to All in such a case, and if you don't use Reply to All when the original message was sent to several people. </p> <p>LookOut! can also warn you if you send a particularly large message, if you leave out the subject or the email signature, if you include the word \"attach\" but forget to attach files, or say anything you're likely to regret. </p> <p>It's easy to take email messages personally and to reply in the kind of language you wouldn't use to someone's face - and there's no way to cancel it once the message has gone. LookOut! can be a useful way of getting a second chance. It can also warn you against using cheesy cliches. </p> <p>You Software - set up by Craig Barnes, who made a career out of selling add-ons for Adobe Photoshop and Quark XPress - has been founded to build add-ons for Microsoft applications such as PowerPoint and Project, and it has started with Outlook. You Perform adds 15 tools to Outlook, from adding all new email addresses to Contacts and automatically saving attachments to a specific folder to scheduling regular emails you need to send. It also tries to catch missing attachments, too. </p> <p>Getting Things Done is a popular time management system - it swept through Microsoft last year - and as so many of the things we need to do arrive by email these days, there's an Outlook add-in designed to help implement the system. </p> <p>The idea is that when anything arrives you deal with it immediately, either doing it, delegating it or putting it into a system you trust. When an email arrives, you decide whether you can delete it, delegate it, file it for reference or hang on to it in case you can do something about it later (like signing up for a course on time management). </p> <p>If you can delegate it, you create a task to remind you that you're waiting for someone else. If you can do something and it will take less than two minutes, you do it straight away. If it will take longer, you either decide when you're going to do it or add it to your To Do list. </p> <p>This add-in formalises the kind of system that many people devise for themselves. However, having the toolbar reminds you to deal with things as they arrive, and the tools combine several steps you'd have to remember to do yourself. You're less likely to forget any of the steps when they are all done from the same dialog box. </p> <p>Alternatively, rather than customising Outlook, you can replace it, with something such as FranklinCovey's Tablet Planner. This is designed to implement a time management system, and was programmed to run on a Tablet PC, so you write your appointments in something that looks like a paper diary using something that looks like pen and paper. But underneath, Tablet Planner connects to a Microsoft Exchange server and gives you the tasks, appointments and contacts you'd see in Outlook. </p> <p>Not many people will want to make such a radical change to their way of working, but if you do nothing else, install Lookout. It will save you hours of opening and closing files and messages, and unlock the useful information in your old emails and documents. </p> <p><strong> Useful links </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Office Online: Outlook</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/FX010857931033.aspx\">http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/FX010857931033.aspx</a><br> <strong> Lookout</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=09b835ee-16e5-4961-91b8-2200ba31ea37&amp;displaylang=en\">www.microsoft.com/downloads</a><br> <strong> SSW LookOut! for Outlook</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/LookOut/ \">www.ssw.com.au/SSW/LookOut</a><br> <strong> Getting Things Done</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com\">www.davidco.com</a> <br> <strong>Tablet Planner</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.franklincovey.com/tabletplanner/  \">www.franklincovey.com/tabletplanner</a></p>",
  "<p> <strong> Is the computer integral to the Sparks' studio set-up? </strong></p> <p><strong>Russell: </strong> We have one of the 2GHz Apple Mac G5s - of course, they've just brought out the 2.5GHz so every week you're obsolete! The one we have was reputed to be the fastest computer ... up until two weeks ago obviously! We use <a href=\"http://www.motu.com/english/software/dp/body.html\">Digital Performer</a> as the backbone because it handles the Midi and digital audio recording together ... effectively, we're using Digital Performer more as a means of capturing the actual performances instead of a tape recorder. </p> <p><strong> So is the G5 as good as we are told it is? </strong> </p> <p><strong>Russell: </strong> For digital audio, it's really great because it's powerful enough to give you more tracks or plug-ins, and everything's still smoother. It is by no means perfect because it still crashes, which is frustrating given that Apple assures us it is the fastest computer available. The other side of that is that it is miles beyond the computers we've had previously. </p> <p><strong> How do you feel about the move towards downloadable music? </strong></p> <p><strong>Ron: </strong> Aside from the issues of music being stolen, one thing that worries me is this idea of people being able to select whatever they want from what you present ... like in <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes\">iTunes</a>. Even if listeners skip over tracks, I want them to have to accept the entire work I'm presenting as an album. </p> <p><strong> Any other concerns? </strong></p> <p><strong>Russell:</strong> It's also completely eliminating the tangible aspect of what's cool about pop music, such as the album artwork. If your whole life is centred around iTunes or its equivalent, then you see a 1 inch by 1 inch digital representation of some artwork, and that's it. There's no back cover or liner notes. I've heard authors say the same of ebooks and downloads, that there's just something about a tangible book ... the feel of it, the smell ... and you can't replace that no matter how convenient it is to have in your Palm Pilot or music in your iPod. Technologically, that is all quite cool but you can't replace that experience of opening a new CD. I was on iTunes for a look around and was disappointed because it's just an interface, and there's no real background to the artists and nobody's really got a visual statement to help you figure out the sensibility of the group. That's a shame. </p> <p><strong> How about the ringtone phenomenon? </strong></p> <p><strong>Ron: </strong> That's bizarre ... they're not even downloading the whole song, just the main hook. It sounds almost Japanese - like slicing things up into razor-thin segments so that nothing is ever really complete, and everything is taken out of context. It's not enough that there isn't time to go through a whole album - there isn't even time to go through a whole song! Once you've got that ringtone, that may be amusing to yourself but it tends to be quite irritating to anyone sitting next to you on public transport.

  "It may say something about Republicans that on the day they dedicated to showcasing their compassion the headline speaker was the man who once played Conan the Barbarian. <p>But if Arnold Schwarzenegger was miscast in his new supporting role - a pro-choice, gun control liberal in a deeply conservative setting - then both he and the audience masked it well. For when the former action hero and current governor of California took to the stage of Madison Square Garden the faithful were ready for him. </p> <p>The delegates' posters, waved to the cameras, had been switched from proclaiming A Nation of Courage to People of Compassion. An array of female and minority speakers had been lined up to soften the edges of a reputation the party fears may be just too hard for many moderates and undecided women. </p> <p>And while the undecideds watched on television, the devoted looked on in the audience. Valerie White, from Asheboro, North Carolina, had had each of her nails decorated with the American flag, and her favourite sequinned vest was in his honour. \"He's what America is all about,\" she said. \"You can come to this country and be successful.\" </p> <p>As though the president's address today were strictly B-list, Patti Gaines, from Alabama, told the New York Times: \"From the time we found out about it, that's who I wanted to make an effort to come and see. I wanted to see Laura, too. It was nice that they were on the same night, but he was the main reason.\" </p> <p>Mr Schwarzenegger's performance did not disappoint. He brought star quality to a party now renowned for its hostility to Hollywood. \"Governor Schwarzenegger is someone people pay $8 to see - in droves,\" said the Republicans' chairman, Ed Gillespie, explaining how Arnie's fame could help Republicans reach beyond the committed to the star-struck. </p> <p>And so the governor did his party pieces. Rehashing lines from his movies, he recounted how a wounded soldier told him, \"I'll be back\". He told the crowd \"America was back from the attack on our homeland\", and the Democrats should have called their convention \"true lies\". </p> <p>Not surprisingly, his biggest cheers were for his least moderate statements. When he branded those questioning the performance of the economy as \"economic girlie men\" the crowd went wild. When he told them he had been inspired to become a Republican by Richard Nixon, they cheered heartily. When he said \"if you believe that this country and not the United Nations is the best hope for democracy, then you're a Republican\", they chanted \"U-S-A, U-S-A\". </p> <p>But in a speech in which he used personal narrative - from immigrant to bodybuilder to film star to politician - to champion the American dream, this was more about his own political prospects than about George Bush. In a 23-minute speech, he mentioned America 47 times, used the word Republican 15 times and referred to President Bush by name six times. As the New York Post columnist, Linda Stasi said, \"whoever put those [Bush] twins on after Arnold needs to be beaten severely about the head and neck\". </p> <p>For the sorority goodtime girls this was their coming out parade, the first time they had publicly supported their father in politics. Giggling through a litany of feeble one-liners, the sole task of the two 22-year-old daughters of Mr Bush was to introduce their father on video-satellite who would then introduce their mother, Laura. The crowd shuffled awkwardly in their seats at their attempts to be cute. </p> <p>As more than a thousand of their peer group were being arrested in the city, the Bush girls gleefully admitted they were \"not very political\" before cracking jokes about their underage drinking and telling the world that their parents' pet name for each other was Bushie. </p> <p>Compassionate conservatism would have sent them back to their temporary hangout, the Union League Club, and to bed with a large Cosmopolitan. CNN's anchor woman summed it up for many when she turned from the sister act to camera to confess: \"I'm not sure what that was about.\"</p>",
  "President George Bush will tonight present himself as the \"candidate for change\" in this year's presidential election, presenting a second-term agenda that will emphasise reform at home and an uncompromising stance abroad. <p>He will address the Republican party convention from the centre of New York's Madison Square Garden, on a small circular podium linked to the main stage by a catwalk. From there, he will make his bid to convince the US electorate to bestow on him something it denied his father: another four years in office. </p> <p>The theme of the domestic elements of the speech will be the march towards an \"ownership society\" as a solution to unemployment, the sluggish economy and a looming pensions crisis. </p> <p>Mr Bush has edged ahead of his Democratic party challenger, John Kerry, in opinion polls in the past week. But his aides are aware that the president's approval ratings are hovering around the 50% mark - hardly a guarantee of re-election. </p> <p>Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said the slight shift in the numbers was principally a result of the campaign by anti-Kerry Vietnam veterans to question the Democratic contender's war record. </p> <p>\"[The polls] represent a serious shift in Kerry's credibility, not necessarily a permanent shift in presidential support. It's more of a Kerry weakness than a Bush strength,\" Mr Luntz said. \"But that's what the convention does. It's to convert a Kerry weakness into a Bush strength.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush's address tonight, formally accepting the party nomination, is designed to stress his attributes as a wartime leader. But it will also lay out a broad outline of his domestic plan to create jobs and control the deficit. </p> <p>Republican officials say the speech will showcase Mr Bush as a \"transformational president\", an \"agent of change\" whose reform programme has only been half implemented. </p> <p>It is a hard task for an incumbent with four years in office under his belt to sell himself as a new broom. That is particularly true when the first term in office has seen another 1.3 million Americans living below the poverty line, and another 1.4 million without medical insurance. </p> <p>Mr Bush is the first president since Herbert Hoover, more than 70 years ago, to oversee a net loss in jobs. A government spending surplus inherited from the Clinton administration has plummeted to projected deficits of more than $400bn (\u00a3223bn). </p> <p>The trick of tonight's speech will be to distance the president from economic problems, blaming them inherited handicaps, the war on terror and resistance to his programme. As one one Republican strategist put it: \"Just because you think the country is headed on the wrong track doesn't necessarily mean you disagree with Bush.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush will argue that the tax cuts during his term in office have begun to turn the economy around and need to be permanent to encourage investment and growth. He will also revive a proposal to eliminate inheritance tax. </p> <p>He will relaunch a plan to deal with the danger of a social security crisis as millions more baby boomers retire, by semi-privatising the system, allowing workers to invest in individual pensions accounts over which they would have control, rather than paying into a general state fund. </p> <p>The critical problems affecting US healthcare will be blamed largely on the costs imposed on doctors and hospitals by malpractice lawsuits. The Bush solution will be to sharply limit the ability of trial lawyers to extract large damages payments. At the same time, tax credits will be used to help the working poor to buy private health insurance. </p> <p>High energy costs will be offset by a renewed push to open up wilderness areas in the US to exploration, in the hope of increasing domestic supply. </p> <p>All the elements of the programme have two traits in common. They will not require large scale government spending in the short term and therefore not increase the deficit, and they all emerged in the course of the first term.</p>",

  "A curfew was imposed on Kathmandu last night, with orders to shoot people on sight, after thousands of demonstrators ransacked a mosque and fought pitched battles with police to protest at the killing of 12 Nepalese hostages by insurgents in Iraq. <p>The rioters attacked the capital's main mosque, set fire to offices of Arab airlines and ransacked the premises of employment agencies offering work in the Middle East. Also attacked were television stations, including one owned by a prominent Muslim. </p> <p>Police used batons and tear gas to control the mob, which chanted \"Down with Islam\". </p> <p>Protesters stormed inside the mosque, set furniture and carpets on fire and tore up a copy of the Qur'an, before police drove them out. </p> <p>Police clamped an indefinite curfew on the capital and later fired on a group of people who had gathered in the centre of the city in defiance, killing one man, an official said. </p> <p>Commentators accused hardline Hindu groups of stoking up anger at the killings.

He knows precisely what he is doing or, perhaps more pertinently, what he does not want to do any more. </p> <p>Ever since the most triumphant day of his life in Sydney last November he has clearly been looking for something to replicate that rush. Climbing Everest twice might appeal to some people but that would mean revisiting old ground and that has never been Woodward's style. Onwards and upwards is his preferred course and football, to a patriot with such limitless self-belief, would be a fitting destination in many ways - unless, like many a modern-day Icarus before him, he strays too close to the Sun. </p> <p>The rugby world will certainly be a duller place without him. To rise at 7am on a Sunday morning in Edinburgh this year and eavesdrop on Woody railing against the feng shui and pipe bands of Murrayfield was a surreal delight; neither will the security guards at Twickenham know themselves without his pre-dawn arrivals for work. </p> <p>Nor will the England players, few of whom ever really knew what Woodward was liable to say or do next. One minute they found themselves on opposite sides of the barricades, notably during the squad's strike action in 2000, the next he had his arm around their shoulders, telling them they were the greatest. Naturally they believed him; Sir Clive is a persuasive guy. </p> <p>His unpredictability, though, long ago became a strength, to the point where he could contradict himself several times within the same sentence. This, perhaps, explains why his soccer ambitions have not received more of a public airing before now. Almost two years ago his wife Jayne confided that her Clive felt he could do for English football what he had done with English rugby. When pushed himself, he laughed it off as someone else's fantasy. Clever, very clever. </p> <p>Who else but Woodward, furthermore, would agree to co-operate with a biographer who had loudly called for him to be sacked after the 1999 Rugby World Cup? Or check the entire team into the smartest hotel in Cape Town on his own credit card as he did on the ill-fated England tour in 1998? Never has there been a coach in any field who has acted so impulsively on gut instinct. </p> <p>And yet it worked. The first on-field signs that a revolution had begun came in December 1997, barely three months after Woodward had been forced to set up his laptop in the reception desk of the RFU's offices because no one had thought to allocate him an office. England drew 26-26 with a startled New Zealand at Twickenham and, although they lost 76-0 to Australia in Brisbane the following summer, rugby politics rather than Woodward's coaching was to blame. </p> <p>There was even a foretaste of this week's developments after the 1999 World Cup when, depressed by England's quarter-final exit to South Africa, he talked darkly about \"skiing uphill\" and considered \"throwing my toys out of the pram\". In those days, though, his ambitions for English rugby were still unfulfilled and subsequent disappointments, notably grand slam failures at Murrayfield and Lansdowne Road in 2000 and 2001 respectively, simply made him and his team more determined. </p> <p>By last year England were winning with equal facility at home and abroad, steamrollering Ireland in Dublin to complete a Six Nations grand slam and registering historic wins in Wellington and Melbourne. Then, as if we need reminding, came the World Cup. England did not always play to their potential but they delivered under the fiercest pressure, just as Woodward had taught them to do. </p> <p>Since that epic night few have bothered asking what would have happened had Jonny Wilkinson's injury-time winning drop-goal swerved away, Beckham-like, towards the corner flag. We shall never know for sure but, had England lost, the pressure on Woodward would surely have reached screaming pitch by now. Five defeats in their last six Tests, retirements or not, is not the platform of strength his successor would like. </p> <p>In five or 10 years' time, however, such minor details will be long forgotten. \"Judge me on the World Cup,\" he once said. So we will. Players sometimes moan that coaches get too much credit. In Woodward's case, who can honestly say England would have won the Webb Ellis Trophy without him?</p>",

  "<p>Software giant Microsoft has unveiled a string of initiatives and new products designed to take on Apple's iPod and position the company for a world in which it sees consumers buying films, music and TV shows online before beaming them around the house and watching them on the move. </p> <p>The company, which dominates the home computer market, today said devices running its Portable Media Centre software would be available in Europe from mid-September. </p> <p>The devices are video versions of music players such as the iPod that will allow users to watch movies and music they have downloaded onto their computers.</p> <p>The decision by Microsoft to launch the software heralds a new era in which viewers can record TV shows onto pocket-sized devices that can be watched on the move or transferred onto a friend's PC.</p> <p>The idea is that users will end up subscribing to vast libraries of content - be it music or TV - in the same way as they might currently subscribe to pay-TV, which they will be able to tap into on the move and in the home through their television, PC and stereo. </p> <p>Users can also record TV shows to their computer or download them from planned services such as the BBC's interactive Media Player (iMP), before transferring them to the portable device. </p> <p>Microsoft is also launching a new \"online mall\" in the US that will offer 200 films from CinemaNow, highlights from Major League Baseball games and the Napster music download service.</p> <p>Senior product manager James Bernard said the content on offer was \"just the tip of the iceberg\" and that new subscription models would offer media companies new ways of selling their content. </p> <p>\"We expect to see CinemaNow come to the UK and we expect to see a series of similar deals across Europe with content owners and sports bodies,\" he said. </p> <p>Thanks to Microsoft's new Media Player software, subscribers to download services will be able to transfer content to their portable devices without having to permanently download them. </p> <p>Napster subscribers paying \u00a39.95 a month, for example, will be able to access the entire library of 700,000 tracks rather than just those they have downloaded. </p> <p>\"We're very excited about this.

  "<p>If you lift up your telephone receiver and listen very carefully, you will hear the quiet but increasing rumble of technological inevitability. The telephone network is, without doubt, moving to the internet. It will be a huge change, and one that will result in many casualties - perhaps even bringing down BT itself. Here's why. </p> <p>Online has devoted a great deal of space to the subject of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in the past few months. This is the technique of sending telephone calls over the internet instead of the specialist phone network, and it has grown rapidly in the past few years. Whereas it was once a crackly joke, today it provides call quality as good as - if not better than - your existing landline connection. </p> <p>With VoIP and the nifty stuff that comes with it becoming more and more common both at school and in the workplace, increased demand for domestic facilities seems inevitable. When we are at home, why can't we have cheap-as-free telephone calls, video conferencing or voicemail that follows us around? Why can't we have telephones that know - like VoIP phones do now - when we are busy on our computers and cannot be disturbed? Why can't we have telephones that tell us it is not worth calling Aunt Mildred because she is already on the line to somebody else, but that she'd prefer an instant message instead? </p> <p>Last month BT announced the start of major new trials of its so-called 21st Century Network, testing a dedicated VoIP as a precursor to a massive migration of its existing network from 2006. </p> <p>But while BT is converting the entire phone network into VoIP, other companies are using the internet to provide the same services. Tiny start-ups such as Gossiptel can already provide customers with VoIP telephones, the associated cool features, and call charges around 50% lower than BT. The only thing required is for the customer to have a broadband internet connection. </p> <p>Previously, that caveat would have disguised a whole series of drawbacks: broadband connections needing an existing telephone line, for which you would be paying line rental, and from which you could not move your number. Moving to VoIP is, of course, less attractive if you need to tell everyone a new telephone number, and loses its lustre almost entirely if you have to continue to pay for your old phone anyway. </p> <p>But things may be about to change. Ofcom are reviewing recommendations that British customers should be able to buy \"naked DSL\". This means the broadband connection no longer requires the payment of a telephone line rental. </p> <p>Furthermore, in a rather controversial move, you will also be able to transfer your existing landline telephone number to your VoIP provider. At the moment, a Gossiptel number starts with an 0870 prefix, but from next month the company says it will be able to transfer your existing number. All the company requires is five days to complete the transfer and you will be free from the yoke of line rental forever. </p> <p>Of course, BT says there is a major difference between telephone calls made over a dedicated network and those over the common internet. \"We want to be absolutely clear that using IP technology in our network for our premium-quality voice services is a gulf apart from the new budget voice over the internet services being launched almost daily by a wide range of providers,\" says Paul Reynolds, the chief executive of BT Wholesale. </p> <p>Fine words, but the question for the average consumer is \"so what?\" Given that internet-based VoIP is proving increasingly adequate for the job, will customers care enough for any advantages that BT's enormous investment in a dedicated network will bring? </p> <p>Whether or not customers migrate to internet-based VoIP or stick with existing providers, it represents a challenge for BT. The latest figures show that the company is suffering a net loss of 100,000 customers a month. To make the situation worse, the company was recently forced to slash the amount it charges to internet service providers for broadband connections in a bid to prevent Ofcom from breaking the company up. And it is these very connections that allow VoIP companies to threaten BT's incumbency. </p> <p>The one remaining reason behind the reluctance to switch to independent VoIP - power supply - is also becoming less relevant in the face of new technology. Many rivals have asked loudly what happens to VoIP devices, which require a separate electricity supply, if there is a power cut. </p> <p>What if you need to call the fire brigade or an ambulance and you find your telephone is dead? BT and other national carriers are bound by law to make sure the service remains in operation exactly for this purpose. Independent VoIP operators,however, are not. So wouldn't people die if this situation took hold? Don't be silly, say the VoIP vendors, it is not a case of either/or - you would use your mobile instead. </p> <p>This increasingly pragmatic view is part of the general trend of installing one large internet connection and running everything on top of it. Many modern housing developments in Sweden, Japan and the US are pioneering this approach, with telephones, broadband internet, cable television and home automation controls all run over a single wire into the home. </p> <p>It is both cheaper and more future-proof than putting in separate systems for everything. Indeed, given a clean slate and no existing infrastructure to worry about, VoIP seems the most sensible choice. The company behind Gossiptel, for example, used its know-how for the installation of the phone network for the new government of Afghanistan. </p> <p>An irresistable digression: the Afghan government's telephone network obviously needed to have outside lines and, being VoIP, these could be connected anywhere in the world. They ended up as numbers with a Northampton dial code, and for a few confusing weeks, the Afghan foreign ministry's number in Kabul was one digit off a Northamptonshire butcher's shop. You can imagine the ensuing consequences until, tiring of the continual orders for sausages, the ministry insisted on a number change. </p> <p>Meat products aside, corporations - like governments - depend on their internal phone networks. In the corporate world, too, VoIP is becoming inevitable - if for slightly banal reasons. Of course, VoIP offers a number of attractive features to those large companies using it for work purposes - conference calling, intelligent voice mail, and so on - but as the technology matures, other reasons become more apparent. </p> <p>The first reason is technological support. According to Mitel, one of the world's biggest corporate VoIP equipment suppliers, half the telephone equipment in use in offices today is \"orphaned\". This means the manufacturers either no longer produce or support that model, or have left the market altogether. Installation of the technology, specific supplier aside, is quickly being a fait accompli. </p> <p>Second, there has been a lot of comment about the low cost of VoIP. For corporate users, this runs two ways. Yes, internal phone calls are routed over the internet and are, therefore, free. Mitel says the average customer will see a switch to VoIP pay for itself in between six to nine months - one UK customer, a major high-street chain, took only four months and saved \u00a380,000 per store. </p> <p>But what is increasingly important is that the cost of installation and management is also greatly reduced. Whereas ordinary phone systems require engineers to arrive before a new employee can be connected, these days you can put a new VoIP phone in the post and have the recipients do the less-than-technical task of plugging it in and turning it on themselves. </p> <p>These cost savings are not to be sniffed at. Mitel says it won one major order on the basis that its equipment only needed one plug, while its competitor's required two. One plug meant the office manager could install it; two meant a man in the van had to be sent round to put in a new socket. On such seemingly minute details does a billion-pound industry revolve. </p> <p>But, as with any major technological shift, the move to a completely VoIP world is not without growing pains. Number changes are carried out via a web interface and not, as before, by a man with a screwdriver in the basement. This is a huge cost saving for the customer, but telephone equipment resellers are finding they need fewer engineers. </p> <p>Nor can they make money on adding people to, and moving them around, existing customer networks. Usually, they would send an engineer and charge a fee, but now - in a metaphor for the entire telephone industry - neither the cost nor the specialist engineers can be justified, and both are being done away with. </p> <p>When telephony becomes just another internet service, what future is there for such an expensive dedication? A happy transition for customers could become incredibly painful for the small resellers. And if it is likely to hurt the smaller companies, just imagine the agony for a company the size of BT.</p>",
  "<p>Struggling telecoms equipment maker Marconi today took a giant step towards recovery as it announced the early repayment of \u00a3669.5m of debt following its restructuring last year.</p> <p>The money was paid well ahead of the 2008 deadline set by creditors, and will save Marconi \u00a355.8m in annual interest charges.</p> <p>\"The early paydown of all of our restructuring debt is an excellent achievement,\" Mike Parton, the Marconi chief executive, said. \"We have emerged with a strong balance sheet, and can now fully focus our efforts on growing our business.\"</p> <p>Today's repayments follow better than anticipated returns from the sale of businesses and improved trading performance at the company. </p> <p>Following an increase in confidence among telecoms customers, Marconi announced its first quarterly profits for three years in May. </p> <p>Last month, the improved trading performance enabled three directors, including Mr Parton, to raise almost \u00a39m from cashing in options granted after they met performance targets, including those for debt reduction. </p> <p>Marconi staved off collapse in May last year thanks to a restructuring in which banks and bondholders agreed to write off most of the company's debt in return for control. Shareholders saw their holdings virtually wiped out. </p> <p>The near-collapse of the company was one of the most spectacular in British corporate history. Formerly GEC, Marconi was an industrial giant built up by Arnold Weinstock, one of Britain's premier industrialists. At its zenith, it was worth more than \u00a330bn.</p> <p>Problems began when Lord Weinstock's successor, Lord Simpson, decided to focus on telecommunications, selling profitable defence businesses and dropping the name GEC in favour of Marconi.</p> <p>Marconi ran into trouble three years ago when the hi-tech bubble burst. Demand for its products from customers such as BT dried up, and it was left with huge debts after an ill-timed acquisitions spree. </p> <p>Thousands of jobs were lost, and Marconi currently employs one third of its 12,400 global workforce at UK sites in Coventry, Beeston, in Nottingham, Liverpool and Chelmsford.</p>",
  "<p>A British Council official who assumed a pseudonym to write Sunday Telegraph articles attacking \"the black heart of Islam\" has been sacked. </p> <p>The government-funded body, which recently commissioned a handbook on Islam \"to prevent ignorant comments about Muslims being made in [the] national press\", said yesterday it had dismissed Harry Cummins, a senior press officer, after an internal investigation. </p> <p>The author's identity was unknown to all but the Sunday Telegraph's executives until it was revealed by the Guardian's diarist, Marina Hyde, four weeks ago, prompting a flood of complaints to the council from Muslim groups. </p> <p>In his four articles, bylined Will Cummins, he compared Muslims to Nazis and argued that Muslim voters have a \"global jihadi agenda\". One of his articles stated: \"All Muslims, like all dogs, share certain characteristics.\" Another argued: \"It is the black heart of Islam, not its black face, to which millions object.\" </p> <p>The author also compared voters in Leicester and Birmingham to the Janjaweed militia who have committed atrocities in the Darfur region of Sudan and claimed that Islam was \"sanctified by the principle ... that any civilisation, however repulsive, has the same value as any other\". </p> <p>In a statement, the British Council said: \"Following allegations that a British Council employee had written a series of articles in the Sunday Telegraph offensive to Islam, an investigation has been carried out and a British Council officer has been dismissed.\" </p> <p>The dismissal was welcomed by the Muslim community, which said the comment pieces had incited racial and religious hatred. </p> <p>Murad Qureshi, a Muslim activist and member of the London assembly, said: \"The British Council was right to move swiftly against something which threatened to reflect so badly on the work it does globally. This was a huge issue for us. But there remains the problem that we rely on the goodwill of public bodies. What we need is legislation which will stop these vicious and pernicious attacks.\" </p> <p>Abdul Bari, deputy secre tary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said the British Council had \"acted swiftly and decisively to distance themselves from the poisonous hatred espoused by Mr Cummins\". </p> <p>An MCB spokesman added: \"We have always insisted that there is a world of difference between criticising a faith and actually inciting hatred of its followers. Harry Cummins had clearly crossed this line.\" </p> <p>The affair has severely embarrassed the council. Last year, Mr Cummins helped to promote a seminar \"to debate press freedom and responsibilities with emerging and potential Muslim leaders\". </p> <p>After the Guardian revealed that Mr Cummins was the author of the Sunday Telegraph articles, the council voiced concern that his writings and the resulting furore might hamper its work. A spokesman described the pieces as \"the antithesis of everything that we stand for and have worked to achieve over 70 years\". </p> <p>Mr Cummins, who had denied that he was the author, was unavailable for comment yesterday. </p> <p>Nor was anyone available for comment at the Sunday Telegraph. But the articles have been publicly criticised by another writer on the paper. Columnist Jenny McCartney said of Mr Cummins: \"He is not a man to let the facts get in the way of his vigorous pursuit of a bad argument. Inaccuracies and distortions abound.\"</p>",
  "A French law banning Islamic headscarves in schools came into force today as France intensified its diplomatic efforts to free two hostages held in Iraq by militants demanding the withdrawal of the new legislation. <p>The law, which is among the most divisive issues of recent times in France, was put to the test for the first time as pupils began the new school year.</p> <p>It forbids conspicuous religious signs or apparel, including Jewish skullcaps and large Christian crosses, in public schools. However, it is aimed primarily at Islamic headscarves and is meant to counter what the government says is a rise in Muslim fundamentalism in schools.</p> <p>It is not yet clear whether Muslim girls who cover their heads will defy the law or compromise their beliefs in order to stay in school. There were no immediate reports of incidents involving pupils trying to enter schools in headscarves.</p> <p>However, experts predict a rash of court cases brought by Muslims who test the law by wearing \"discreet\" head coverings such as bandannas.</p> <p>Another factor, the continuing hostage crisis in Iraq, hung ominously over the new school year. France has refused to give in to calls on it to repeal the law from the Islamic Army of Iraq, which is holding two French journalists hostage</p> <p>Efforts to rescue Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot, both reporters, are being led by the French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, who is now in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on the fifth leg of a diplomatic mission to rally support from Arab leaders. </p> <p>France's industry minister, Patrick Devedjian, told the RTL radio in Paris: \"The situation is extremely difficult and the government is doing its utmost to secure the release of our compatriots.\" </p> <p>He said he could not confirm whether the two reporters were still alive. They were seized on August 20 between Baghdad and Najaf. </p> <p>Mohammed Bechari, a vice-president of the French Council for the Muslim Faith, is travelling to Iraq with a delegation of French Muslim leaders to try to help ease the crisis.</p> <p>He called for a calm response to the implementation of the new law, telling Le Figaro: \"The hostage-takers are just waiting for a provocation ... We must be responsible.\"</p> <p>Even Muslim leaders who oppose the law barring the headscarf from schools have said they hope for an uneventful return to school and criticised what they regard as the kidnappers' attempts to interfere in French internal matters.</p> <p>Fouad Alaoui, the secretary-general of the Union of French Islamic Organisations, said: \"Those people know nothing about France. France is a law-abiding state, and those who do not agree with the law cannot express that disagreement by hostage-taking.\"</p>",
  "<p>Dignitas says it gives people in unbearable pain from incurable diseases the chance to die in pleasant surroundings by the shores of Lake Zurich, at a time of their choosing. </p> <p>There is nothing back-street about the procedure provided by the charity. Swiss law gives citizens the right to physician-assisted suicide at their home or in a hospital. All staff at the clinic are medically trained, although the nurses do not wear uniforms and are unpaid volunteers.</p> <p>Most of their clients suffer from motor neurone disease and cancer. There is a small fee to join up, and clients must pay for the doctors' time and the drugs used to kill them - but Dignitas makes no profit at all from the service.</p> <p>Getting hold of Dignitas from the UK, however, isn't easy. The Voluntary Euthanasia Society, which campaigns for the right to die, refuses to give out the Swiss charity's contact details for fear of being prosecuted for aiding and abetting someone to commit suicide, an offence which can carry a jail term of up to 14 years.</p> <p>The company has a website, but it is entirely in German. But sending an email will elicit a response in English. Once contact has been made, it is a simple process to join up.</p> <p>Applying for assisted suicide however takes much longer. Dignitas says it goes through every check and will only help someone to die if they are absolutely certain the person is of a fit enough mental state to make the decision. Around 80 per cent die naturally, living out their final months in the knowledge that should the pain become unbearable, they can apply for an assisted suicide.</p> <p>Once the application has been made, the charity will ask for a letter from the member's GP to confirm the diagnosis and prognosis. Dignitas will then investigate the case and, if the application is successful, the person will be invited to the charity's plush flat in the centre of Zurich to see a doctor.</p> <p>When in Switzerland, the patient will be asked to fill in a questionnaire and will be interviewed by a consultant to ensure there was no outside pressure and that the person understood the procedure. Dignitas says it assures patients they can change their mind at any time.</p> <p>A nurse will offer the patient an anti-nausea drug, which takes 20 minutes to act, to ensure the lethal dose is not vomited up. Then, if the patient still wants to go ahead, the nurse will give them a liquid dose of barbiturate to take.</p> <p>This is the point of no return. The client will lose consciousness within five minutes and will be dead soon after. Policemen and external doctors will then arrive to check whether the procedure had been carried out in accordance with the law. Dignitas will take care of the cremation and flying the ashes home.</p> <p>The founder of Dignitas, former human rights lawyer Ludwig Minelli, says he would be delighted not to have to help foreign nationals to die. But unless there is a change in the law, Dignitas is sure to have a long list of clients searching for the right to die with dignity.</p>",

Since the publicity that surrounded his case, there has been a sharp increase in the number of British people travelling to Zurich to die.</p> <p>Figures seen by SocietyGuardian.co.uk show that, since October 2002, 22 people have been helped to die.</p> <p>British membership of Dignitas has also shown a sharp increase, rising from 90 at the end of 2002 to 557 last month. </p> <p>Britons now make up 13% of the charity's total membership of 4,154 people in 52 countries. Around 20% of people who become members go on to be helped to die by the organisation.</p> <p>Lesley Close, whose brother was the fifth Briton helped to die by Dignitas, said: \"The disproportionate interest shown by UK citizens is clear from the membership figures as well as the number of deaths.</p> <p>\"This does not reflect a unique British position: it reflects the fact that Reg Crew's bravery in going public with his journey to Zurich opened a door which showed ordinary people with terminal illnesses - people like my brother - that there was a way to end their suffering with dignity.\"</p> <p>Since its establishment, Dignitas has helped 304 people to die, around two thirds of them from outside Switzerland.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a survey published today, commissioned by the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, found that 50% of people would consider going abroad to receive medical assistance to die if they were suffering unbearably from a terminal illness.</p> <p>The survey results come as 80,000 expressions of support for a change in UK law were today submitted to a select committee investigating a private member's bill put forward by Lord Joffe, which would legalise euthanasia.</p> <p>Deborah Annetts, the chief executive of the VES, said: \"This indicates that people are prepared to seek alternatives when the law provides none. </p> <p>\"It is tragic enough that people should feel they have to make such difficult journeys when they are so ill, but to know that any relatives or friends who help them could then be jailed is a cruel uncertainty. </p> <p>\"The director of public prosecutions must stop prevaricating and issue guidance as to whether they will prosecute relatives.\"</p> <p>Lord Joffe's Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill would allow people to die at the time of their choosing once they have proved that they are in the right state of mind.</p>",
  "Thank you for coming. It's always a great pleasure to be here at Chatham House. <p>A year ago, Kofi Annan summed up what many were thinking when he spoke of the United Nations \"at a fork in the road\". There was a feeling that collective action had failed, and that the Organisation's future was at stake. On one side were accusations of unilateralism. And on the other was the conviction that our collective security was being threatened in new ways, with an insufficient collective response being offered. </p> <p>It was clear that we needed to build a new consensus. The High Level Panel appointed by the Secretary-General has the task of proposing how that consensus might look; and I look forward to its conclusions. Let me offer some remarks today from a British perspective.</p> <p>In asking how the United Nations can adapt for the future, it is worth looking first at what lessons we can learn from its past.</p> <p>After the Charter was signed in 1945, the New York Times warned that it \"can be either the soul of a brave new world or merely a scrap of paper, depending on the will and action of its creators\". That \"will and action\" has varied over the UN's 60-year history. During the Cold War, although it did do some major work such as the resolutions on the Middle East, the Council was hampered by the superpower stand-off. In the whole period until 1990, it adopted only 17 Chapter VII resolutions. But today, the Council is the scene of remarkable international collaboration: it has adopted 24 Chapter VII resolutions over the last year alone. The UN's founders were well aware that they had not created an organisation fixed in stone: President Truman, at the signing ceremony, said \"no-one claims that [the Charter] is now a final or a perfect instrument\". But change has, in fact, come about not through revision of the Charter text, but by making flexible use of the instruments which it established. UN peacekeeping, for example, is nowhere mentioned in the Charter, but it has been one of the Organisation's great successes. Since they won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988, the \"blue helmets\" have helped to bring peace and democracy to countries such as Namibia, Cambodia, El Salvador, Mozambique and East Timor, and continue to maintain stability from Haiti to Sierra Leone to the Ethiopia-Eritrea border. </p> <p>So its history shows that the United Nations is an effective tool for action when - though only when - its members have the political will to use it. And it shows too that the Organisation is a flexible instrument which is able to adapt - though again, it has done so when and only when its members have been willing to drive that change. </p> <p>The UN will need the same political commitment if it is successfully to adapt today. And it is vital that we build such a commitment to change, because the nature of the threats which we face has evolved, and because they demand collective and global responses.</p> <p>Today's threats are as likely to come from non-state groups such as terrorists and criminals as from states themselves. And they affect us all. The terrible siege at the school in Beslan, in the Russian Federation, shows again that terrorists are prepared to attack anyone, anywhere, without a shred of human compassion. The trauma for those poor innocent children is unspeakable, the anxiety for their parents unimaginable. Their suffering is our suffering. The awesome responsibility of President Putin and his Government is our responsibility too: first, out of simple human compassion and natural solidarity with the Russian people, whose sacrifice in the second world war helped secure our peace and future as well as theirs; but also, because this barbarism unfolding across the world's television screens is a horrible reminder that international terrorism is a present danger to all of us, wherever we are. The Security Council last night was therefore absolutely correct, in calling for the unconditional release of the hostages, to reaffirm that terrorism is one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. </p> <p>It is not only terrorism within one state which has to be the concern of the international community as a whole, but other conflicts too. The situation in Darfur, from where I returned last week, demands action both because it is a human tragedy, and because it affects the whole region through the spread of instability and the movement of refugees. And in Gatumba, in Burundi, the horrific massacre a few weeks underlines the continuing potential of that conflict to destabilise the Great Lakes, and the challenges which the UN force there has to face. </p> <p>Those conflicts also show how threats to our security today are often linked to a range of factors such as the breakdown of order, poverty, disease, crippling injustice, environmental degradation and climate change. Unless we tackle such issues, we will not be able to build long-term, sustainable global security. The modern security agenda demands new and wide-ranging forms of collective action. And the United Nations is uniquely fitted to deliver them. The UN alone offers the global reach which is needed, and has the international standing and legitimacy to bring the international community together, developed and developing countries alike.</p> <p>It is beginning to fulfil that role. Over the past years, the Security Council has expanded the range of issues which it determines to be threats to the peace - covering the overthrow of democratically-elected government, terrorism, large-scale human rights violations, humanitarian catastrophe, refugee crises, and states which flout their international obligations on weapons of mass destruction. It has also considered uncontrolled small arms flows and the HIV-AIDS pandemic. </p> <p>We now need to take that evolution further, with the Council beginning to treat such issues more consistently, and as a matter of course, rather than in the relatively ad hoc way in which it has done so to date. That means that we need to continue to build a shared understanding of the nature of the modern threats to international peace and security.</p> <p>And alongside that, we also need to develop a greater consensus on how we can collectively address those threats. Let me highlight three areas for discussion.</p> <p>First, we need to be able to act earlier, as threats emerge; and our action needs to be sustained.</p> <p>To encourage a quicker response to emerging threats, the Secretary General could consider making more use of his power, under Article 99 of the Charter, to bring any matter which in his opinion may threaten international peace and security to the Security Council's attention. But no Secretary-General could do this in a vacuum, nor at the risk of being embroiled in an argument among Security Council members. So the UN's member states, not least the members of the Security Council, also have to face up to their responsibilities. Despite the warnings from United Nations staff this Spring of looming catastrophe in Darfur, and active efforts by the UK to draw international attention to the situation, it took the Security Council until the end of July to agree a resolution. Member States need to provide the UN Secretariat with the analytical capability it needs, and act on its warnings.</p> <p>We also need to ensure that international action is co-ordinated and sustained, particularly in post-conflict societies. Although the success of Namibia or Mozambique shows what can be done, countries emerging from civil conflict may relapse back into it within only a few years. Duplication of effort or competing programmes and priorities can be fatal to such fragile societies - if, for example, economic reforms cause high unemployment, and that coincides with the demobilisation of large numbers of battle-trained soldiers. So the United Nations needs to ensure that its own agencies work together, in pursuit of common objectives, with a clearer division of responsibilities; and it also has the wider potential to act as a co-ordinator of other international efforts and programmes. </p> <p>The second area which I want to highlight is the need to develop more effective tools for collective action. </p> <p>On terrorism, we need to maintain the recent momentum created by Resolutions 1526, on sanctions against Al-Qa'ida, and 1535, on the Counter-Terrorism Committee; and to put those Resolutions' objectives into practice. On the spread of small arms and light weapons, we should build greater international support around the UK's Transfer Control Initiative, aimed at securing agreement, at the UN Review Conference on small arms in 2006, to curb the export of such weapons to countries where they can fuel conflict or the abuse of human rights. </p> <p>We should also look to strengthen the UN's growing relationships with regional organisations. Chapter VIII of the Charter was remarkably visionary in nature, drafted at a time when few regional organisations existed; today, the Security Council could make more use of it. The UN has the potential to act as a clearing-house for the exchange of resources and capabilities - for example, facilitating NATO airlift support for an African Union operation, or deploying a European Union policing contingent as part of a force of UN-led peacekeepers. </p> <p>Perhaps the most sensitive question in the debate about the tools at our disposal is that of collective intervention in another state - including, in the most extreme cases, the use of military force. But it is a discussion which we need to have. </p> <p>A journalist [E.B. White] at the San Francisco Conference in 1945 wrote that underneath all the talk of collective security could be heard \"the throbbing of the engines: sovereignty, sovereignty, sovereignty\". There was no sense that the new Charter had removed the Westphalian principle of non-intervention in a state's internal affairs which lay at the basis of the international system. </p> <p>But equally, all members of the United Nations have accepted some limitation on their power to do as they please, in the service of collective security. It can no longer be acceptable to classify situations such as that in Darfur, or before in Rwanda or Kosovo, as simply the concern of one national government. States have the right to non-interference in their internal affairs; but they also have responsibilities, towards their own people, and towards the international community and their international engagements. Where those responsibilities are manifestly ignored or abused, the international community may need to intervene: the cost of failing to do so in Rwanda still haunts us today. So we are, correctly, not allowing the Sudanese Government to regard the situation in Darfur as a sovereign matter which is none of the world's business - but instead, we are putting pressure on that Government to meet its responsibility to provide security for its people. We are now giving active consideration to the Secretary General's report on the situation which issued yesterday.</p> <p>In the most extreme cases of crimes against humanity or humanitarian catastrophe, such as in Kosovo in 1999, international intervention may also have to include the use of military force. Such action will always be a highly sensitive topic in the international community, and rightly so. But there are some signs that a consensus is beginning to emerge. We need now to build on that - for example by restarting discussion on the basis of the guidelines for humanitarian intervention which the Prime Minister first proposed in 1999. </p> <p>And the debate is also evolving in the face of today's threats to international security. In the wake of the September 11th 2001 attacks, the Security Council recognised that large-scale terrorist action could constitute an armed attack that will give rise to the right of self-defence; and that force might, in some circumstances, be used against those who plan and perpetrate such acts and against those harbouring them, if that is necessary to avert further such terrorist acts. It was on that basis that the United Kingdom participated in military action against Al Qa'ida and the Taleban in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Alongside the debates on humanitarian intervention and action in self-defence, we also need to start building a consensus around the broad criteria for action by the Security Council against threats to international peace and security. We can build there on the growing understanding that these threats are wider, and different in nature, than before. On all of these questions and many others, the UN will be at its most effective when it promotes the widest possible international collaboration. So we also need to address the question of broadening the membership of the Security Council itself, on which the UK has a long-standing position. In pursuing that reform, we should be guided not just by a concern for representation, but by a recognition of the responsibilities which membership entails. That need not necessarily imply accepting specific military commitments. But it does require strong engagement with security issues across the board, wherever they arise. </p> <p>The third theme which I want to highlight is the importance of building the wider conditions for long-term, sustainable security. Let me take just two quick examples.</p> <p>The first is good governance. Well-governed, capable and accountable states are less likely to act aggressively, descend into conflict, or harbour terrorists and criminals - so we all have an interest in supporting them. The United Nations is well-placed to develop international norms on good governance, provide practical support for their implementation, and set up mechanisms for their review. And it also has unique legitimacy and expertise in spreading practical democracy. In Afghanistan, the UN's success in registering some 10\u00bd million electors has been remarkable. And in Iraq, the UN has a vital role to play in overseeing the political process. Just over a year on, the terrible and tragic attack of 19 August last year in Baghdad is still a painful memory for the UN's staff there, as it is for all of us. We and the United States are working closely with the UN to ensure that it gets the security which it needs to increase its presence on the ground, in order to offer the Iraqi Independent Electoral Commission and the Interim Government the advice and support which they have requested to organise successful elections. It is important that we do everything we can to maintain the time-table for those elections in January. And I welcome the appointment of Ashraf Jehnagir Qazi as Special Representative of the Secretary General, to lead the UN team in Iraq.</p> <p>The second example is this: The UN could do more to make development assistance more effective and better co-ordinated. It can help to push aid donors to greater generosity, and encourage recipients to spend aid more transparently and more effectively. As we have seen in Darfur, more could be done to improve the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system. The UK therefore strongly supports the Good Humanitarian Donorship process, promoting better co-ordination and prioritisation, and the more effective allocation of resources. </p> <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p> <p>Let me conclude with some observations on Britain's own role in shaping the United Nations' future.</p> <p>We have helped to shape the UN from its foundation. In 1946, London hosted the first meetings of the General Assembly, in Methodist Central Hall, and the Security Council, in Church House. Through our role in the Security Council and other UN bodies, our important contribution to the budget and to peacekeeping operations around the globe, and our strong commitment to an effective international system, we can be proud of the part which Britain has played in the UN's development. </p> <p>And we are well-placed to contribute as the UN adapts to today's global security challenges. Our armed forces are second to none, and highly adapted to modern, mobile operations. And we pursue a modern, active and wide-ranging foreign policy which helps to build the conditions for long-term global security and sustainable development. Tony Blair has convened the Commission for Africa, with the aim of putting the concerns of that continent back at the top of the international agenda. We will continue to lobby for the International Finance Facility proposed by Gordon Brown, which offers the potential of doubling development aid by leveraging the power of the capital markets. We will use our Presidency of the Security Council in October to lead work on following up the Secretary-General's report on Justice and the Rule of Law, an initiative which I launched during our last Presidency a year ago. And next year, when Britain holds the Presidency of the EU and the G8, we will have an important role to play in preparing for the Summit reviewing progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, and in following up the work of the High-Level Panel. </p> <p>Britain has as vital an interest as any country in a strong, modern and effective United Nations. We will remain at the forefront of efforts to build a new international consensus on the threats we face, and the tools which we can use, collectively, to address them. The UN's history shows a remarkable capacity to adapt and to realise its potential. We need now to ensure that it continues to do so, to address the security challenges of the next decades.</p>",
  "Do you remember the \"British Disease?\" It once described Britain's economic and industrial weakness when the trade unions were out of control. The last Conservative government cured it. <p>Today, there is a new British disease. But this time it is in our hospitals. And it actually kills people. The new British disease is the superbug in our hospitals which it is estimated kills at least 5,000 people a year. One hundred people a week dying from an infection picked up as a direct result of going into hospital.</p> <p>It is a devastating figure: 5,000 lives lost needlessly and tragically. Hospitals are supposed to cure you, not kill you.</p> <p>The hospital superbug is far worse in British hospitals than in most European hospitals. </p> <p>Why isn't there a national outcry? Where's the government's sense of urgency?</p> <p>It is worth remembering what happened 50 years ago. In December 1952, London was brought to a standstill by a terrible smog. It was a real pea-souper. It lasted four days. Even in a city used to smog, this was exceptional. The Ministry for Health estimated that more than 4,000 people had been killed as a result. </p> <p>Quite rightly, there was a national outcry. The Clean Air Act 1956 was the inevitable result. Today pea-soupers are a distant memory. A smog that kills people in their thousands is unimaginable.</p> <p>But, half a century later, there is another killer on the loose. Every year, some 5,000 people are thought to die in our hospitals from hospital infections. They go in to be cured. They end up dead. The problem has been getting worse every year under Labour. Deaths from the hospital superbug have doubled since they came to office. </p> <p>But unlike the 1950s, there is only half-hearted Government action. This is intolerable. </p> <p>Time and again, the Government has been told about this problem. </p> <p>Four years ago, the official watchdog - the National Audit Office - said action was required. It made detailed recommendations. Yet this summer it described implementation of those recommendations as 'patchy.' In fact it even said the NHS still didn't have enough information on the extent and cost of hospital acquired infection - let alone what to do about it. And there were still such basic problems as compliance with guidance on hand hygiene. </p> <p>Meanwhile Labour have launched 20 initiatives in the last four years - initiatives designed to catch headlines. Yet more and more patients go on catching the superbug. Yesterday, the 21st initiative was launched to encourage hospital staff to wash their hands. I welcome that. But it's hardly rocket science. Why on earth has it taken almost four years to come up with such a basic recommendation when the issue of handwashing was first raised in an official report as long ago as November 2000?</p> <p>This is intolerable. We cannot go on with a piecemeal approach like this. Most of us know people who are now too frightened to have an operation in case they catch the superbug. The time has come for a sustained and effective programme of action.</p> <p>The next Conservative government will therefore make ridding our hospitals of the superbug a key priority. Patients deserve, and patients will get, clean and safe hospitals. </p> <p>There are certain essential steps we will take.</p> <p>First, we are going to scrap the plethora of targets that divert attention away from tackling the superbug. The man charged with running the NHS - its Chief Executive - has admitted that Government targets have made dealing with the superbug more difficult. </p> <p>The independent National Audit Office says the same. The NAO says that targets set by the government have made it more difficult to deal with Hospital Acquired Infections. </p> <p>And nurses say targets mean there is often little time to clean beds between patients. This is the report in the Nursing Times from May this year, of a conference on infection control: \"Nurse delegates said that government waiting time targets in A&amp;E, coupled with high bed occupancy rates, meant that there was little time for hospital staff to clean beds in between patients\"</p> <p>Pressure to meet Government targets can also mean that even when an infection control team recommends that hospitals close wards to control an outbreak of infection, the hospital chief executive sometimes refuses to do so. This is what the National Audit Office Report said in July this year: \"Twelve per cent of infection control teams reported that their recommendation to close a ward or hospital to admissions for the purpose of outbreak control was refused or discouraged by the chief executive\" So infected wards are now staying open because of Government targets. And, quite possibly, patients are dying as a result.</p> <p>Under the Conservatives, patient safety will come first.</p> <p>Secondly, we're going to give patients proper information about the superbug. Even today, the NHS cannot tell you exactly how many patients are affected by hospital infections or where the concentration is.</p> <p>We will ensure that clear infection statistics are available to patients for every hospital in the country - and department by department. That will mean that the staff in those departments know where the infection is present and take responsibility for dealing with infection in their wards.</p> <p>Third, we will give every patient the Right to Choose what hospital they have their operation in - not, as with Labour, the right to choose between only one or two hospitals, and even that only after a six month wait - but a right to choose any NHS hospital. </p> <p>So if patients don't want to be treated in a filthy ward, or one with a high rate of infection, they won't have to be.</p> <p>Hospital managers will therefore have real incentives to force up standards. Dirty hospitals will lose patients and the funding which goes with them. Clean hospitals will win gain patients and the funding which goes with them. The reputation of hospitals will be based in part at least on how clean and infection-free they are. The best hospitals will drive up standards for the worst. This is how choice works to improve standards.</p> <p>All hospitals will compete to be the cleanest and safest in the country. With less paperwork from Whitehall, they will be free to do so. They will take the steps needed, including putting matrons in charge, closing beds and wards when necessary, and screening patients before operations in high-risk areas.</p> <p>They will have an incentive to get all their staff thinking about cleanliness. At the moment, the NAO say people often think it someone else's problem. I want to see a culture of cleanliness running through all our hospitals, from top to bottom. </p> <p>Britain's high rates of superbug are not inevitable. Many countries have lower rates of hospital infection generally - and British patients are particularly likely to catch MRSA itself. </p> <p>So other countries have systems in place which make MRSA less likely to occur.</p> <p>That's what I want to institutionalise in the NHS. Our policies will achieve that. And the Right to Choose is at the heart of our approach.</p> <p>The superbug is a British disease. The Right to Choose is the cure.</p> <p>The failure to beat the hospital superbug is just one horrific example of Labour's failure in our health service. Too much centralisation. Too much bureaucratic interference. Too much red tape. The result? - Too little freedom for the professionals who know best. </p> <p>Let me just read you the main headline in The Times newspaper of two days ago: </p> <p>\"Foundation hospitals strangled by red tape.\" </p> <p>\"Chief Executives say promised freedoms are being watered down\"</p> <p>Labour just can't help themselves. They promised freedoms to the new Foundation Hospitals. But their bureaucratic urges always get the better of them.</p> <p>This is what the Chief Executive of one NHS foundation trust in London said. \"You cannot give freedoms to a foundation trust and a matter of 17 weeks later come along and start changing those freedoms\"</p> <p>Another Chief Executive of an NHS foundation trust in Birmingham said that the NHS bureaucracy was stifling the hospitals because it wanted to keep control of power.</p> <p>That is why the Conservatives will give the Right to Choose to professionals in the health service as well as to patients.</p> <p>That is the way in which we will overcome the hospital superbug and save the lives of patients. And that is the way in which we will raise standards more generally across the NHS.</p> <p>Nothing but the best will do for our country. We're not getting that now. The next Conservative Government will do its utmost to enforce that we get it in the future.</p>",

  "<p>It does seem to good to be true. But Rimonabant is the closest scientists have come to a wonder drug that promises to banish two of the most deadly excesses of modern life. </p> <p>But in the fog of hopefulness that surrounded reports of the drug this week, a subtle note of caution has been missed. This is a drug that works by altering the way the brain normally functions. In that respect, it could be much more risky than you might imagine. </p> <p>Rimonabant has just completed a year-long trial that involved more than 1,500 people. Those on the drug lost an average of 19lb each, 11lb more than those taking placebos. All participants on the trial were encouraged to exercise more as well. </p> <p>The drug works by binding itself to receptors in the brain that, when activated, produce an urge to eat or smoke. By preventing any chemicals reaching these receptors, the desires are reduced. </p> <p>The study found that the drug also helps to reduce some of the other health problems associated with obesity such as diabetes, heart disease and high levels of bad cholesterol. </p> <p>For Steve Bloom, the head of the investigative science division at the Imperial College School of Medicine and a researcher in how the brain controls appetite, the drug is a mixed blessing. \"There's no doubt that the population is dying like flies from obesity - 1,000 deaths a week,\" he says. \"It's a criminal thing that we're not putting more effort into treating it, and here is something that stops you feeling hungry. </p> <p>\"But there is a problem,\" he adds. \"To begin with, can I compare this drug, for the sake of an argument, to heroin? Heroin makes you feel happy, heroin stops you feeling hungry, heroin works extremely nicely. But it's not an acceptable drug because it interferes with your normal mental processes.\" </p> <p>Rimonabant also interferes with normal mental processes, and could have longer-term implications we are yet to discover. The question is whether changing people's drive and motivation is a good idea in the long run. </p> <p>\"I would have a high level of caution about it,\" says Bloom. \"On the one hand, as a physician, I'm delighted to have something that works for obesity. On the other hand, it really worries me that here you have something that alters people's drives. </p> <p>\"For example, will it stop people getting married now? Will it stop them getting promoted at work? If you're taking away the edge that makes them want to smoke, will it also make them work less hard?\" </p> <p>The problem for clinical researchers is that they have few tools to detect how drugs affect the cognitive functions of those using them. \"In the treatment of hypertension, it took them many years to do quality of life assessments and discover that many of the drugs used to treat hypertension made people very miserable,\" says Bloom. </p> <p>For scientists, whether the drug should be prescribed to people will ultimately depend on how bad the obesity problem becomes. </p> <p>\"If you think that obesity is a serious disease, then you'll accept the downside,\" says Bloom. \"If you're of the opinion that obesity is a self-control issue, then you wouldn't want to interfere with somebody's mind just for that reason. </p> <p>\"What we need to do is instigate more controls over behavioural sides of this drug. We need to have more evidence as to whether it affects behaviour. I don't think the current trials have been looking at that particularly effectively.\"</p>",

Variety reports that the Easy Rider veteran will star as a retired doctor who - instead of whiling away his remaining years on the golf course - winds up stumbling onto the genetically stored memories of a killer. Backed by 3210 Films to the tune of $3.5m, the film shoots in Vancouver next February. </p> <p><strong>Robert Greenwald</strong> - the man behind the provocative documentary Outfoxed - is set to make a film, Bud &amp; Bill, looking at the relationship between the father of Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh and the father of one of the victims of McVeigh's 1995 attack. The two men, Bill McVeigh and Bud Welch, struck up an unlikely friendship during McVeigh's trial. Mr Welch's daughter Julie was one of those who died in the bombing.</p> <p><strong>Mean Girls</strong>'s Rachel McAdams and Girl with a Pearl Earring's Cillian Murphy are to take the leading roles in Wes Craven's new thriller, Red Eye. The deal is said to be the largest so far in McAdam's career (with a cheque for $1m), and shooting is set to start in November.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Sony Pictures</strong> may be nearing a settlement in the class action over the use of fake critics, filed by two LA filmgoers, Omar Rezec and Ann Belknap. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the settlement - which charged Sony with misleading filmgoers by quoting a fictional critic in advertisements - could be for more than $1m, meaning that individual moviegoers could receive as much as $5 each, depending on how many decide to claim. Any remainder would go to charity. During 2000 and 2001 a series of posters for Sony films featured recommendations by \"David Manning\", a critic at the Ridgefield Press. No such Manning existed, and the reviews quoted had never featured in the pages of the Ridgefield Press. Two enterprising cinemagoers then sued Sony under California law for luring them into cinemas to see its films under false pretences.</p> <p><strong>The Toronto film festival</strong> has received an anonymous death threat after agreeing to screen a controversial film about torturing a cat. Variety reports that the festival, which runs from September 9 to 18, has also been the recipient of angry phone-calls and emails over the film, Casuistry: The Art of Killing a Cat. The film looks at the videotaped torture and killing of a cat in 2001 by three men claiming that they were protesting against factory farming. An animal rights group denied being behind the threats, but asked the organisers to pull the film, which they say features \"many apologists for the cat torturers\".</p> <p><strong>The Hollywood rumour mill</strong> says Time Warner is launching a determined bid to take over film studio MGM. Shares in MGM have been rising in response to rumours that a deal is in the offing. Variety reports that Time Warner has now moved its bid from deal consisting of shares and cash to one that is entirely cash based. The offer, they say, is worth around $4.5bn - somewhat less than majority MGM owner Kirk Kerkorian may have hoped for. MGM has been the subject of intense speculation in recent months as most industry watchers assume it will eventually be absorbed by one of its larger competitors. </p> <p><strong>Star Trek</strong> mainstay James Doohan was yesterday honoured with a star on the Hollywood walk of fame. Doohan, 84, played hard-pressed engineer Scotty throughout the long-running 60s TV show and latter movie spin-offs. Confined to a wheelchair and suffering from Parkinson's disease, Doohan was joined at the ceremony by Star Trek co-stars Walter Koenig (Chekov), George Takei (Sulu) and Nichelle Nicholls (Uhuru). A few thousand ardent Trekkies were also in attendance.</p> <p><strong>Renee Zellweger</strong> is set to sell her \"fat clothes\" in a charity auction. According to the Daily Star, the Oscar winning actor has now returned to her usual svelte figure after putting on weight for her role in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. She will now, they say, sell her outfits online, and donate the proceeds to children's charities.</p>",
  "<p>Time has run out for the shapely, hourglass figure. The curvaceous form - traditionally perceived as the embodiment of feminine beauty - is disappearing, according to analysis of the nation's expanding waistlines. </p> <p>The results of the first UK National Sizing Survey were published yesterday, revealing that average measurements around women's midriffs have increased by 6.5in (16.5cm) in a little over 50 years. </p> <p>Men's bodies are thought to have inflated by a similar proportion over the same period: an authoritative study of women's shapes was undertaken in 1951, providing a comparative baseline, but no such study was done for men who, it was then assumed, had suits tailor-made. </p> <p>The latest survey took three years to complete, exploited sophisticated, three-dimensional bodyscanning technology, cost \u00a31.2m and was jointly funded by the Department of Trade and Industry and 17 leading British clothes retailers. Its findings have prompted a sharp intake of abdominal flab. </p> <p>We are, it suggests, getting larger and turning into tubular men and women - with measurements around our chests, waists and hips gradually converging. Preliminary results from an identical study in the US show we are not yet, however, as rotund as Americans. </p> <p>Average measurements for British women were a 38.5in bust, 34in waist, and 40.5in hips; for men the figures were a 42in chest, 37in waist and 40.5in hips. In the 1951 survey, women's average measurements were 37, 27.5, and 39. </p> <p>The figures are likely to reinforce political anxiety about the level of obesity but larger sizes may also reflect improved nutrition since the end of the second world war. The average woman at the start of the 1950s, for example,was 5ft 3in [159cm] tall; her counterpart today has grown to 5ft 4.5in. </p> <p>The SizeUK survey took more than 1.5 million measurements from about 11,000 people during 2001 and 2002. The oldest volunteer was a 95-year-old woman. Participants were asked to walk into bodyscanning machines in shops and retail centres around the country, where stripes of white light were projected on to them. </p> <p>The resulting distortions were recorded on camera and automatically broken down into a pattern of electronic points. Faster than a shop assistant's tape measure, the US-manufactured [TC]2 machines derived 130 measurements from each subject within seconds. </p> <p>Women were generally more eager to volunteer than men but the numbers used for the study were statistically adjusted in an attempt to reflect the general population's breakdown by ethnicity, age (over 16), social background and regional distribution. It took 18 months to analyse the data. </p> <p>Philip Treleaven, professor of computer science at University College London, was director of the survey. \"The big thing we found out is that everyone is developing a tummy,\" he said yesterday. \"It might have been more accurate to call it ShapeUK. The 3D scanners allow you to look at the curvature of people's stomachs and bottoms. </p> <p>\"There's never been such a survey producing such a wealth of size and shape data. Retailers will be able to use the data to help them cater for all their customers but it will also benefit other sectors such as the transport industry.\" </p> <p>Andrew Crawford, of Bodymetrics, which is storing the data, said it was invaluable and could be cross-referenced with lifestyle questionnaires given to volunteers. \"We asked people to what extent they went to gyms or sat on a couch and drank beer,\" he said. \"Beyond fashion, this survey could help the transport industry - buses, planes, cars and trains - improve the dimensions of their seats. Furniture manufacturers could produce more comfortable chairs and sofas.\" </p> <p>Medical experts may be able to exploit the technology to create matching prosthetic arms for those who have lost limbs in accidents, suggested Richard Barnes, the managing director of Select Research which participated in the study. \"Plastic surgeons we talked to were very enthusiastic about it.\" </p> <p>SizeUK made some calculations about the health of those it surveyed. Using body/mass indexes it judged that half of the men and women measured were normal, 38% of women and 44% of men were overweight or obese, and 12% of women and 6% of men were underweight. </p> <p>Among the clothes retailers involved were Marks and Spencer, House of Fraser, Monsoon, Bhs and Miss Selfridge. The technology will enable companies to produce more accurate clothes dummies to send overseas to their sub-contractors producing their outfits. </p> <p>In future, Mr Barnes said, shops may install bodyscanning machines to attract customers. The computer technology can generate images of figures fitted with clothes, saving the bother of trying on trousers or jackets. \"It can be a bit difficult emotionally for people,\" he cautioned. \"It's like hearing yourself on tape for the first time. You are seeing yourself as others see you.\"</p>",
  "<p>What is Apple trying to tempt us with this time? A glamorous new wireless desktop computer as skinny as a catwalk model, as minimal as a John Pawson flat, that's what. For those of you working at home, the iMac G5, launched in a whirl of dry-ice publicity in Paris this week, will allow you to say farewell to dog/cat/toddler-trips-over-cable misery as you hurry to meet deadlines. Or it might be used to impress green-faced office colleagues stuck in front of antique Anglepoise-style iMac computers dating all the way back to 2002. As for those still cranking out their work on the first generation of multi-coloured translucent iMacs of 1998: they are dismissed to the outer realms of the electronic ether. </p> <p>The latest iMac, designed by Apple's relentlessly award-winning Jonathan Ive in his Silicon Valley studio, is not just good-looking, with every accessory you could possibly need packed inside its two-inch-deep, 17 or 20-inch wide screen; it has a memory approximately a million times greater than the very first generation of home computers beginning with the MITS Altair 8800 that went on sale in the US, in kit form, priced $395, in January 1975. </p> <p>That machine looked like a leftover from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, the sort of anonymous box of electronics that you find dumped in canals. But, it could be used at home - a giant leap for the computer - and was tiny compared to the cabinet-sized IBM machines that looked like giant tape-recorders. </p> <p>Steve Wozniak's Apple 1 made its tenuous debut at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California in April 1976. It represented a revolution-in-the-making, but, clad in timber, looked like a component from a 1930s telephone exchange, and made a Louis XV chair look positively hi-tech. Teamed up the following year with Steve Jobs on the prototype Apple II, Wozniak approached Jim Warren at the first of his West Coast Computer Fairs. Housed in a beige plastic case, Apple II boasted such highly desirable refinements as a built-in keyboard and coloured graphics. When the two Steves offered a sceptical Warren a share in their new company for space at the fair, he shook his head. That headshake cost Warren a fortune. </p> <p>Apple blossomed. Its 1984 Macintosh became a darling of the design and publishing industry. Beige, upright and boxy, and very, very slow compared to the Apples and PCs we are used to now, it marked the beginning of the clear-cut divide between Apple and the rest. </p> <p>Increasingly aware of the marketing power of chic, as opposed to purely practical design, Apple had Ridley Scott direct its TV and cinema ads that year, and then, bit by megabyte, began to shape a new generation of machines calculated to appeal to graphic designers, product designers, architects and, ultimately, to the design-conscious chattering classes as a whole. </p> <p>The British-born Ive brought real excitement to the design of desktop computers with the 1998 iMac. Brightly coloured and wired up for the internet, it adorned the desks of cooing designers and their groupies. In his book Electric Dreams: Designing for the Digital Age (V&amp;A Publications, 2004), David Redhead notes that even as Business Week magazine greeted the iMac as \"illustrating the company's gradual slide into irrelevance\", Apple sold 150,000 of the colourful computers on the first weekend they went on sale. </p> <p>Computers had finally adopted the sleek and even sensual styling of the best hi-fi systems and cameras. What had looked like inscrutable components from hard-worked laboratories or early Moog synthesisers were now consumer goods, lifestyle accessories, desktop fetishes to preen over and show off. </p> <p>Most PC users see their computers as hugely useful tools: they will tell you how many more functions, or how many zillion more gigabytes of processing power, their latest laptop has compared with an iMac G5. This, though, misses the point. Simplicity of operation aside, Apples relies on sheer style to sell, at a premium, in a hugely competitive market. Even though products such as the iMac and iPod have widened the appeal of Apple and boosted sales to new heights, the company has just 3% of the global PC market, down from 5% five years ago. As Jobs told Time magazine in 2000: \"Victory in our industry is survival.\" </p> <p>Ive and his team are already well advanced on the design of the next generation of Apple computers. How they will look is, inevitably, a closely guarded secret. They could, of course, look like anything. Why not abandon minimalist, silver-sheen chic and produce a desktop that can be packaged and repackaged in any number of styles to suit fans of Gothic, Greek, Bauhaus, or deconstructivist styles? Office managers would have a fit, of course, because theirs, for the most part, is a world of the IBM-style neatness of 40 years ago. </p> <p>This is the very world the miniature computer has helped so many people escape, to set up on their own, to gain control over their own destinies, and perhaps why Apple has made a design fetish out of its desktop and laptop computers. Not only can they look good at home but, plugged into the world, with your choice of music, you feel, if only fleetingly, master or mistress of your universe. </p> <p>Apple's computers are an attempt to create a little piece of perfection in an imperfect world. It can never win, of course, and gradgrind PCs will continue to dominate the market, but as the latest iMac shows, Apple simply can't help but keep trying to lead us into electronic temptation.</p>",
  "<p>At 67, Anita Desai says she is becoming something of a drifter. She didn't leave India until she was 45, but now lives between Boston, Mexico, Cambridge and Delhi. She visits India less and less, just once a year, and \"briefly\" at that. \"Modern-day India is slipping away from me,\" she says. </p> <p>At an age when most writers are descending deeper into their own fictional worlds, into meditations on age, identity and the bankruptcy of the modern world, Desai is exploring lives increasingly remote from her own. Her new novel The Zigzag Way is set in Mexico and Cornwall, and is narrated by a young American writer, a man, who travels to the Sierra Madre without really knowing why. Desai says that this is more and more her own experience. \"There are two ways of travelling: there is the stumbling, directionless kind, and there is the more efficient sort, where you know exactly where you are going and how long it will take. But I think most things in my life have come about through chance, through serendipity.\" </p> <p>She is an unlikely-looking chancer, in her black and white sari and black jacket, her grey hair neatly tied back and a handbag over one shoulder. At the Edinburgh book festival last week, she came on stage carrying a couple of plastic bags and fidgeted with her handkerchief and several bookmarks during her introduction - but if she seems shy and self-effacing, you shouldn't mistake this for weakness of character. She is fiercely bright, extremely well read and has a neat way of unpicking a bad question from the audience. \"She has this absolutely steely core,\" says Alison Samuel, her editor. \"She doesn't suffer fools, I think, but she does it with such grace.\" </p> <p>The idea for the new novel grew out of Desai's passion for Mexico. She first went there six years ago, during a particularly cold New England winter, and immediately felt its affinity with India. \"It's such an ancient country, you feel every stone has a history to tell. Mexico and India share a history of colonialism - 300 years of Spanish and British rule - along with this much, much longer past that goes back into myth. Physically, we're alike, too: I am constantly taken for a Mexican.\" The novel focuses on the history of Mexico's silver mines, which for a time employed large numbers of Cornish miners. The places they lived in are now ghost towns, and the only signs they were ever there are the local pasties, and a rumour that the Cornish brought football to Mexico. </p> <p>Desai wrote the novel over several years, in breaks from teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, often sharing a house with her youngest daughter, Kiran, who is also a writer. (Kiran Desai's first novel, Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard, won a Betty Trask award in 1999, and she has just completed a second.) \"She works upstairs and I work downstairs,\" says Desai, smiling. \"It's a very good arrangement.\" </p> <p>The Zigzag Way is an unfashionably quiet, subtle book, in which history and landscape are more important than character and denouement; like many of Desai's books, it is open-ended. If the first rule of fiction is never to mention the weather or dwell on the scenery, Desai breaks it every time - but she manages to make them matter. \"I wanted to put Mexico in the foreground,\" she says, and the book is full of sunsets on purple mountains, lonely plains strewn with volcanic rubble, the silhouettes of twisted cacti, the air \"sharp as glass cut into splinters, flashing\". She has no argument with the modern taste for noisy, show-off fiction, she says - it is just not her style. \"I think writers have a duty to reflect the times, which are noisy, faster, wilder - but it's not my experience and I can't pretend it is; for some reason it always shows in the writing.\" </p> <p>In her fiction - 11 novels, two collections of short stories - Desai has instead explored the lives of middle-class Indians, the encounter between India and the west, and, in particular, the lives of Indian women. Her mother was German and her father Bengali, and although she was never discouraged from pursuing a career, she felt the options available to her were very limited; there was a strict progression from school to university to marriage and motherhood, with no break between. </p> <p>\"My older sisters both had careers, one as a doctor, the other as a civil servant, but I felt really there were few choices.\" She married at 20, after leaving Delhi University, where she studied English, and had two sons and two daughters. She had by this stage published several short stories, and still found time to write - although she has said that this work was \"utterly subservient to that of being a wife\". She was encouraged by her neighbour, the author and Merchant-Ivory screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, who now lives in New York and so remains a friend and neighbour. </p> <p>As a young woman, Desai says she felt her own life was not big or broad enough to feed her writing. \"My whole life was about family and neighbours: it was very difficult for a woman to experience anything else. I was bored, and I needed to find more range, which is why I started to write about men in books like Baumgartner's Bombay [in which a German Jew flees the war in India] and In Custody [a college lecturer goes in search of a famous poet]. Men led lives of adventure, chance and risk. It just wasn't possible to write that from an Indian female perspective.\" </p> <p>In her 1999 novel Fasting, Feasting - her third to be shortlisted for the Booker prize - an unmarried woman is forced to care for her demanding, elderly parents, while her adored younger brother is sent to study in America. It is a brilliantly angry book, full of quiet rage about the pressures on women to marry and to serve (and, in America, to consume). In one brief, devastating scene, the cousin who won a place at Oxford but was forced to marry instead is wrapped in a nylon sari and set on fire: it is unclear whether she has committed suicide, or has been killed by her husband and mother-in-law. </p> <p>In 1990, Desai wrote a controversial essay for the Times Literary Supplement, A Secret Connivance, in which she argued that Indian women connive at their own subordination by aspiring to mythic role models, in the form of Indian goddesses. Desai says she believes that Indian society has changed since then, although not necessarily at a radical level. \"Women are now actively encouraged to work, but the reasons are chiefly economic - it is recognised that women have earning power, too. The pressure to marry is still huge, and so in some ways there are increased pressures.\" The American students she taught are no less obsessed by marriage, she says, but for almost opposite reasons. \"They are very much on their own from a young age, from the minute they learn to drive. And while Indian family life can be suffocating, the American family can be a lonely place.\" </p> <p>Desai arrived in America too late to catch the \"second wave\" of the feminist movement in the 60s and 70s, and left India too soon. \"I don't think feminism reached India till the 80s and 90s. Really it was something that affected my daughter's generation. Women were involved in politics when I was growing up because Gandhi and Nehru were keen that women be a part of the independence movement. These women were looked upon as heroines, but they were also great exceptions.\" She thinks Sonia Gandhi was right to have stood aside as prime minister after the Congress party's victory in this year's general election. \"It was a role she inherited and not one she chose. She would have been used as a tool by the party. The Gandhi-Nehru dynasty could have gone on and on for ever, but I think she was very wise to break it. And it's really magnificent news that a government I so much disapproved of has been voted out.\" </p> <p>On her annual visits to India, to see her husband and eldest son, Desai feels more and more a stranger. \"One likes to imagine that things have stood still, but so much happens. I have become an observer, and not a participant. And so much has happened to me that to them, my friends and family in India, I am becoming a ghost.\" She recently gave up teaching, \"because it required my best attention. I kept breaking my thread and it's a bad way to write.\" Home for the time being is wherever she can find the solitude she needs to work - Mexico, New York state, Cornwall, Cambridge, wherever. After all these years, she is leading the life she wanted for her characters, and which for years she thought could only be a man's - a life of adventure, chance and risk. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Zigzag Way by Anita Desai is published today by Chatto, price \u00a312.99.

  "<p>Indian film-maker Mira Nair has been approached to direct the fifth Harry Potter picture, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which is due for release in 2007. The Monsoon Wedding director says that she has read Steven Kloves' adaptation but has yet to reach a final decision.</p> <p>\"I read it over the weekend and I'm still deciding,\" Nair said. \"I'm not letting all this go to my head.\" But she admitted: \"My son Zoharan's excited. I've seen all the Harry Potter movies with him.\"</p> <p>Nair, 47, has won plaudits for her work on the films Salaam Bombay, Mississippi Masala and Monsoon Wedding. But her latest, most ambitious picture is already prompting more mixed reviews. The director's star-spangled adaptation of Vanity Fair opens in the US this weekend, with Reese Witherspoon playing Becky Sharpe and James Purefoy, Bob Hoskins, Jim Broadbent and Romola Garai in the supporting roles.</p> <p>According to the Boston Globe, Vanity Fair is \"a toothlessly pleasant bit of period tosh\". Over at the New York Times, critic Stephen Holden accused it of \"conceptual confusion\", explaining that: \"in mixing satire and romance the movie proves once again that the two are about as compatible as lemon juice and heavy cream\".</p> <p>The first two Potter outings were directed by safe Hollywood hand Chris Columbus, while this year's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was whipped into shape by Mexican film-maker Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n.

  "The entry in the official \"Master Calendar of Events\" looked too good to miss: \"The Right Stuff - Conservative Comedy Show (invitation is not required)\". <p>The humour began long before the mike was switched on. The Laugh Factory club on 42nd Street seems to share an address with one of 8th Avenue's many midtown sex stores, which perhaps accounts for the fact that only a few dozen politicised punters made it along for the opening act at 7pm. </p> <p>\"Are you a journalist?\" said one intense-looking man who slid along next to me, as I sat fingering my notebook. Around my neck was a plastic photo id card emblazoned with the word, PRESS: \"Ah, in that case I don't want to sit next to you. Are there any real Republicans here?\"</p> <p>It was the same opening question put to the small audience by The Right Stuff's compere, \"Big Daddy\" Jeff Wayne. From what I could see, there were only three genuine delegates present, but the room stayed completely silent when he asked if there were any Democrats in the house. </p> <p>\"I've had people telling me there were no protesters at the Democratic Convention - well that's because they were all at the convention,\" was the opening salvo, fired leftwards. </p> <p>Mr Wayne is a self-styled \"white trash\" native of Kentucky, who now lives in California. Together with seven other right-leaning comics, he has been touring the country and Republican-friendly media circuit for the last year now. Performing in the Democratic bastion of New York City during convention week is the icing on the cake for The Right Stuff team. </p> <p>Sometimes really funny, sometimes tasteless, and sometimes just extreme, the jokes were aimed at familiar enemies of the party faithful. John Kerry, Bill Clinton, and of course, the French: </p> <p>\"I'm still angry about France, aren't you,\" said Mr Wayne, to heavy applause. \"They gave us the Statue of Liberty and we thought so much of it, we threw it right in the damn water. I want to take that torch off and put a finger on it instead.\"</p> <p>Julia Gorin, a Jewish Republican New Yorker (\"not so much a minority, but an extraterrestrial\"), performs wearing a diamond choker and a locket around her neck, containing photographs of President Bush and Condoleeza Rice. For her, Europe is a burgeoning anti-Semitic superstate: </p> <p>\"When I first heard that Europe was unifying, I gave away all my Star of David necklaces. I locked the door, turned out the lights, hid in the attic, and started a diary.\"</p> <p>On the opposition to war in Iraq, she said liberals everywhere should rejoice at the lack of WMD: \"They shouldn't think of it as a war, they should think of it as an expensive social programme. We did find Sarin and Mustard Gas - two banned chemical agents. But the Democrats even downplayed this... 'Sarin and Mustard Gas; big deal - I did those at college'.\"</p> <p>Bill Clinton never fails to raise a derisive laugh, and Ms Gorin had the best Clinton one-liner of the night: \"Bill takes the L right out of public service\". Mr Wayne's most withering gag was aimed at John Kerry's wife, Teresa, who inherited billions from her first marriage to Ketchup scion, Senator John Heinz. </p> <p>He asked if anyone had heard her convention speech last month in Boston: \"It was slow, full of vinegar, and when it was finished you just wanted to smack her bottom.\" </p> <p>The most irreverent comic on the bill was Chris Warren, who comes from a \"military background\" and owns his own comedy club in the north-western outpost of Spokane, Washington. He was wearing a white T-shirt bearing the slogan: \"comedy for real Americans\". Last year he joined US troops in Baghdad, as part of the official entertainment to lighten the post-invasion mood: </p> <p>\"I spent 22 days over there, covered that country north, south, east and west, and I'm now qualified to say about Iraq - what a shit-hole this place is... It was 130 degrees, there was no alcohol, you can't touch the women... I was ready to strap on a bomb, ok?\" </p> <p>His act was peppered with self-deprecating jokes at the expense of American redneck culture, but it was certainly no place to be for Democrats of Arab descent, or anyone with west coast environmentalist sensibilities, or - yes, the French:</p> <p>\"The next time I see Shock and Awe, I want to see the Eiffel Tower in the background,\" was Mr Warren's contribution to the diplomatic debate. There was no Machiavellian hand of Karl Rove in the script writing here.</p>",
  "<p>Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella has been persuaded to join the world of commercials, shooting a \u00a315m blockbuster campaign for Guinness.</p> <p>Like many movie directors who have filmed adverts, the director of Cold Mountain was attracted by the opportunity of a budget of millions of pounds per second, an utter luxury in the film world.</p> <p>The commercial, which will appear on television from next Wednesday, breaks with Guinness's traditional esoteric advertising.</p> <p>Once again Guinness has opted for an image of a wild horse to evoke strength and vitality.

But the \"Guinness\" prisoner opts to free his horse in order to win the animal's trust.</p> <p>Minghella draws a parallel with the prisoner taming the horse in front of prison guards with the \"surge and settle\" that occurs when pouring Guinness into a glass and waiting for it to assume its familiar black and white form.</p> <p>The final shot of the advert shows the man riding the horse across a prairie that resembles the familiar light and darkness of a glass of Guinness.</p> <p>The British film director, who won an Academy Award for the English Patient and who started his career as a scriptwriter on EastEnders and Grange Hill, was chosen because he could put emotion into the commercial, Guinness said.</p> <p>\"We wanted someone who could tell a human story very well,\" said the Guinness marketing director, Nick Robinson.</p> <p>\"We wanted to build the legacy of good advertising that Guinness has had in the past and we thought that Anthony would help us to do that.\"</p> <p>\"This campaign is about putting the product back in our advertising,\" he added.</p> <p>The advertisement will be used in the UK only, although Guinness will consider showing it in its 150 international markets if it is judged a success.</p> <p>Guinness's image has always been a challenge for the stout manufacturer - more than 50 years ago it was advertised as a drink that could give strength with a workman carrying a steel girder on his own.

Seventeen gunmen, some wrapped in explosives, swept into Middle School 1, running into the school courtyard from the nearby railway station and sparking Russia's most serious domestic crisis since the Dubrovka theatre siege two years ago. </p> <p>Diana fled. She hid in the boiler room with 14 others, a teacher and a parent who had been attending the ceremony. </p> <p>\"We managed to peek through the crack in the door,\" she said. \"The gunmen were armed with machine guns and my teacher noticed one girl among them wearing a mask. Someone said they were speaking in Chechen.\" </p> <p>Amid the disinfectant of newly scrubbed floors and the gleam of whitewashed walls, the attackers filed through the school corridors. </p> <p>Moments later, Diana heard an Ossetian voice outside the room. \"We whispered to him, 'help us get out'. He did, yet as we ran from the boiler room, the [militants] noticed us. Some of us were grabbed by them and were taken off to the sports hall. Now I am here, outside, and they are there.\" </p> <p>Inside, scores of pupils aged from seven to 17 were herded into the school's sports hall along with parents and teachers. One official estimate put the total number held at 336. According to reports, mines were laid about them, and children posted at the windows to prevent sniper fire. </p> <p>The suicide bombers eventually made their demands clear in incipient negotiations with the authorities: the release of 24 prisoners, fellow militants captured in a recent raid, talks with the presidents of North Ossetia and neighbouring Ingushetia and Russian withdrawal from Chechnya - a demand that no Russian president can meet. </p> <p>The Kremlin called an emergency sitting of the UN security council in a bid to shore up international support for its inevitable backlash. President George Bush was one of the first to express condolences and solidarity in a message the Kremlin portrayed as support for Russia's own peculiar war on terror. </p> <p>Earlier in the day, President Vladimir Putin pledged that he would never negotiate with terrorists or even Chechen separatists. But with the bloody end of the Dubrovka theatre siege - in which 129 people were fatally gassed during a Russian assault - still fresh in the popular consciousness, the Kremlin strongman needs to minimise casualties. </p> <p>Outside the school the reason for a soft approach was clear. Relatives milled around, dumbstruck that a decade of conflict in the nearby republic of Chechnya had crossed the border to wreak such havoc with their families. Two corpses lay near the school building. A sniper on the roof kept doctors away from one girl, who lay wounded in the inner grounds of the building. </p> <p>Mothers screamed at helpless policemen. One was shown on television saying: \"How long can this madness in the country continue? When will it end?\"Another wailed: \"Exchange us for the children. What are our children guilty of?\" Another said: \"This was my child's first day at school. He was so happy and told me: 'Mum, I will be a good student'. Please, take me, take me, instead.\" </p> <p>The local authorities struggled to retain control of the situation as the day progressed. A brief shootout between police and the hostage takers ended with reportedly seven people dead, including two officers, and a dozen wounded. The gunmen fired rocket-propelled grenades at an armoured personnel carrier that approached the building. </p> <p>A videotape was given to police by the militants, according to Oleg Tsagolov, a spokesman for the president of North Ossetia. It was blank. The mobile phone number they gave did not work. The militants refused to accept food for their hostages. </p> <p>A man answered the school phone, according to the New York Times, and said he was part of a group led by Shamil Basayev, the Chechen field commander who has led several chilling, deadly raids into Russia over the past decade. </p> <p>The gunmen said they would execute 50 hostages for each one of them that was killed, and 20 for each wounded. </p> <p>The gunmen had entered North Ossetia from neighbouring Ingushetia, Mr Tsagolov said. \"They captured a police captain in Koli-Gou, and then came in his car [and a military truck] to Beslan.\" </p> <p>He said the policeman escaped and told officials there were 17 militants, many wearing suicide bomber belts, including two women. </p> <p>One schoolboy, Arsene Dedeyev, 15, told the Russian NTV television channel that a friend had seen the militants \"standing far away from school a while ago, looking at it with binoculars\". </p> <p>Anatoli Sikoyev, a parent in his fifties, described from Beslan hospital his lucky escape. \"When I heard the news I rushed to school to save my family. I approached the schoolyard and came across a man with a huge beard. He shouted at me: 'lie down and crawl backwards' ... Then another man shot at me from a window, hitting my hand and skimming my head.\" </p> <p>One policeman, carrying his AK -47, whose son was inside the school, said: \"The life of a child is priceless, and for their lives I will do everything I can. But if Moscow orders an assault, I will kill the person who gives the order.\"</p>",

  "<p>The French government is giving up control of France T\u00e9l\u00e9com by raising up to \u20ac5.75bn (\u00a33.9bn) as part of a debt reduction campaign to met eurozone rules on government borrowing. </p> <p>The finance ministry announced yesterday that it was placing up to 12.1% of France T\u00e9l\u00e9com shares. The sale would cut its stake in the company to just over 40%. </p> <p>The move sparked speculation that other cash-strapped governments could sell shares in former state-owned monopolies. Germany, for example, which like France is in breach of the eurozone rules that limit government debt to 3% of GDP, has 43% of Deutsche Telekom. </p> <p>Commenting on the timing, one corporate financier said: \"There is merit in going early in the [post-holiday] season because markets may become more volatile in the run-up to the US elections and there are other governments willing to sell telecoms stock.\" </p> <p>Deutsche Telekom shares followed those of France T\u00e9l\u00e9com lower yesterday. Some traders suggested that the German company's share price may have fallen as investors sold stock to switch into France T\u00e9l\u00e9com. </p> <p>The planned placing of between 236m and 299m shares, priced between \u20ac18.95 and \u20ac19.25, is the biggest equity offering in Europe this year. By taking the government's holding below 50%, it marks a watershed in the relationship between the state and the former telecoms monopoly. </p> <p>France T\u00e9l\u00e9com was privatised in 1997. It embarked on an acquisition spree, which by March 2000 had seen the shares reach \u20ac219 - but the company's debt rocketed. </p> <p>When the tech stock bubble burst, the share price crashed and the company was almost crippled by the debt burden, which forced it into a painful restructuring programme. </p> <p>In 2003, the government backed a \u20ac15bn rights issue that lifted its stake to well above 50%, which, until earlier this year, had been the legal minimum it could hold. </p> <p>The finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, is hoping to make a capital gain on the rescue rights issue, which was priced at \u20ac14 a share compared with the asking price of around \u20ac19 for the placing. </p> <p>\"This [sale] will allow the state to reduce its debt and give the company the flexibility it needs,\" he said after a cabinet meeting yesterday. </p> <p>Though France T\u00e9l\u00e9com is not raising money through the placement, it is issuing up to \u20ac1.15bn worth of bonds - convertible into shares in five years - in parallel with the government placement. </p> <p>Analysts said the move was aimed at reducing the costs of financing a debt burden that has come down from around \u20ac75bn to about \u20ac47bn, rather than raising cash to spend. </p> <p>The reduction in the France T\u00e9l\u00e9com stake also marks a key point in Mr Sarkozy's plans to privatise a big chunk of remaining state-owned assets. Despite union protests, the government is pressing ahead with plans to sell shares in energy utilities Electricit\u00e9 de France and Gaz de France. </p> <p>As part of the planned placement, both France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and the government have agreed not to sell more shares for nine months.</p>",
  "<p>The fate of two French journalists kidnapped in Iraq remained unclear last night as a deadline passed with no word on their fate, while an Iraqi militant group said it had freed seven truck drivers seized more than a month ago. </p> <p>The drivers - from India, Kenya and Egypt - were on their way back to Kuwait yesterday after the firm that employs them announced it had agreed to the kidnappers' demands to pull out of Iraq. </p> <p>The Kuwait and Gulf Link Transport Company (KGL) also said it had paid $500,000 to the abductors, who were part of a group calling itself al-Rayat al-Sud or the Black Banners Division of the Islamic Secret Army. </p> <p>\"They were not trying to make a political statement, they were purely extortionists,\" KGL's chief executive, Said Dashti, said in Kuwait as the seven arrived there. </p> <p>\"We didn't sleep from happiness. Thank God, everyone helped us,\" one of the freed hostages, Egyptian Mohamed Ali Sanad told al-Arabiya TV. </p> <p>Television footage showed a kidnapper, his face covered by a red-checked kaffiyeh , shaking hands with each captive and then handing them a copy of the Qur'an. </p> <p>An eighth, previously unknown, hostage, a Turkish truck driver, Tassin Abdul Rahim, was also pictured being released by kidnappers. </p> <p>Violence continued to shake Iraq last night, this time in Falluja, where US forces launched an air strike on a target they described as a safe house where militants had been spotted executing a captive. The victim's identity was not known. Hospital officials and witnesses said 17 people were killed in the US attack, including three children. </p> <p>The abductors of the French journalists had threatened to execute both men if the French government did not repeal a law banning the wearing of headscarves in French schools, which comes into effect today. </p> <p>Last night the deadline passed with no word on whether the pair - Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot, who were seized in Iraq nearly two weeks ago - were still alive. </p> <p>President Jacques Chirac reiterated yesterday that the French authorities \"would continue to do their utmost, in these difficult hours and days\", to free the two journalists. The foreign minister, Michel Barnier, was in Doha yesterday to meet editors at al-Jazeera, which has broadcast video footage of the pair. </p> <p>France's normally fractured Muslim community has united to express its outrage at the hostage-taking. </p> <p>An official delegation from the French National Muslim Council has been despatched to Baghdad. </p> <p>Friends and relatives of the two men said they were sick with worry. \"I can't even watch the television,\" Mr Malbrunot's mother, Andr\u00e9e, told Le Parisien. \"I knew he shouldn't have gone this time.\" </p> <p>Mr Chesnot, a reporter for Radio France International, and Mr Malbrunot, who writes for Le Figaro, disappeared on August 20 while on their way to Najaf. </p> <p>They appear to be in the hands of a hardline Sunni Islamist group and were almost certainly seized near Mahmudiya, a Sunni enclave 30 miles south of Baghdad. </p> <p>Yesterday's release of the seven truck drivers came a day after another Iraqi militant group announced it had shot dead and decapitated 12 Nepalis, the worst mass killing of hostages in Iraq. </p> <p>Dozens of foreign nationals have been kidnapped since April, when Iraq's resistance embarked on a new tactic designed to scare away foreign firms and investors. </p> <p>Most foreigners have now left. The only westerners still in Iraq and travelling around without armed escorts are journalists. </p> <p>The Najaf-Baghdad road has become treacherous and yesterday gunmen opened fire on a convoy carrying the former Iraqi governing council member Ahmad Chalabi, killing two of his guards. </p> <p>Mr Chalabi was the subject of counterfeiting allegations last month, but said yesterday that the charges against him had been dropped. An Iraqi judge said he would issue a final decision as soon as today on whether to proceed with the case.</p>",
  "<p>EBay, the online marketplace, yesterday continued its push across the globe with a $530m (\u00a3296m) offer to take full control of its South Korean affiliate, Internet Auction Co. </p> <p>EBay is locked in a battle with Yahoo! to become the number one online auction brand in Asia. It grabbed the early lead in China in 2001 with an investment in EachNet, for which it paid $150m last year. In June, eBay agreed a $50m deal to buy India's biggest site, <a href=\"http://www.Baazee.com\">Baazee.com</a>. </p> <p>The company's one black eye has been Japan, from which it withdrew in 2002. </p> <p>The South Korean market offers huge potential. South Korea has the highest penetration of broadband internet access in the world, some 11m people out of a population of 48m. It is also Asia's second-biggest online auction market. </p> <p>Internet Auction claims to have 9.9m users and at the end of June offered 2.5m items for sale online. </p> <p>EBay said it had agreed to pay some institutional shareholders in the company $325m to raise its stake from 62% to 86%. It will pursue a tender offer to buy the remaining shares at the same price in the next few days, bringing its total offer to $530m. </p> <p>Jay Park, an analyst at Samsung Securities, said the offer was consistent with eBay's strategy. \"EBay wants all of Internet Auction, to take it off the market and make it a private company. That has been their policy globally in order to allow aggressive and speedy decision making,\" he said. </p> <p>Shares in eBay, which have been one of the few success stories from the internet boom, were trading 60 cents higher yesterday at $87.14. </p> <p>Ebay is now in 29 countries and the overseas operations are playing an increasingly important role. </p> <p>In the company's second quarter, revenues from the US site increased 36% to $450m. Revenues from transactions on international sites increased on the previous year by 82% to $324m. </p> <p>That means international operations now account for 42% of total turnover. </p> <p>EBay has driven overseas growth through a combination of acquiring local operators which have copied its model and building new sites from scratch. </p> <p>It continues to enjoy rapid growth. In the second quarter, eBay recorded total revenues of $773.4m, up 52% on the same period last year. Operating profits of $254m were 108% higher than the same quarter in 2003.</p>",
  "<p>Video Networks, owner of the HomeChoice video-on-demand service, is planning to raise up to \u00a380m at the end of the year as it seeks a broader shareholder base to support expansion plans. </p> <p>The company hopes to extend the HomeChoice service to cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow. HomeChoice is available to 1.25m London homes and already has the funds in place to widen its coverage to 4m over the next year. The largest shareholder in Video Networks is Chris Larson, one of the founders of Microsoft, who rescued the company from closure with a \u00a360m cheque two years ago. </p> <p>Roger Lynch, chief executive of Video Networks, said Mr Larson has agreed to back the latest funding push, but the company needs a broader shareholder base as it seeks to become a nationwide service. \"We are doing a fundraising later this year and it will be in the range of \u00a360m to \u00a380m ... We want to bring in a larger shareholder base that can accelerate our growth. A lot of our cost going forward will be in acquiring subscribers and we want to set up for our growth nationally.\" </p> <p>Mr Lynch said the company had yet to appoint an investment bank to lead the fundraising and had not decided on the means of raising cash, from issuing new shares to offering convertible securities. Private equity investors will be considered but they are one of many possible sources of funding, he added. The other shareholders in Video Networks include Time Warner and Disney, which control less than 10% of the company between them. Mr Larson is by far the biggest investor, with about 80% of the equity. </p> <p>Another fundraising is possible in 2005, when Video Networks will consider expanding nationally in earnest, Mr Lynch said. </p> <p>\"Our national rollout would require additional capital but that would be around 2005.\" </p> <p>Video Networks offers over 5,000 Hollywood films on demand and specially tailored channels, which include US and UK drama. It also offers a \"catch-up TV\" service which plays back popular programmes from various channels, including EastEnders and Coronation Street. Because it is beamed to subscribers through telephone lines, it also sells a broadband service and will shortly match cable's \"triple-play\" offering by marketing a telecoms service. </p> <p>The biggest breakthrough for Video Networks since its rescue came last month, when it secured a deal with BSkyB to carry premium channels such as Sky Sports 1 and Sky Movies. The deal, brokered by former NTL and BSkyB executive Jon Sykes, made HomeChoice an easier sell to viewers who have yet to grasp the video-on-demand concept.</p>",
  "<p>On October 22 2003 I got an email from Conrad Black. By then, the scandal that would ultimately wrest control of the Telegraph Group from him and catapault him into Maxwellian disgrace was gathering pace. But if Black was worried, he wasn't showing it. \"Dear Debbie,\" he wrote, \"The problems have been absurdly exaggerated and are well in hand, but thanks for your good wishes anyway. Once again, to the consternation of my detractors, a number of whom you have interviewed, the charette will arrive empty at the guillotine and the tricoteuses will have to stick to their knitting. Regards, CONRAD BLACK.\" The baroque, frequently impenetrable language was typical of the emails - by turns combative, funny, and sometimes plain weird - which I received from Black during the three years I spent making a documentary about him. I wrote back, questioning his use of the word tricoteuses. His reply came the following day: </p> <p>Dear Debbie, I was using tricoteuses in the sense of Carlyle and other commentators on the French Revolution, as the ghastly, wretched, morbid women who knitted while the victims were steadily conveyed to the guillotine and executed. I have always attracted such people and their presence is a badge of honour and my unvarying ability to disappoint them is one of life's pleasures, though ranking well behind wholesome sex and chocolate cake. Regards, CONRAD BLACK </p> <p>It would be nice to say that it was uncanny prescience that led us to begin making a documentary about Black 24 months earlier, but unfortunately it wouldn't be true. I decided to make a film about the man who was once the third-largest English-language newspaper publisher in the world because I found him a perversely fascinating character, a bookish, status-hungry press baron who wanted a ringside seat at the sport of British politics. Dare I say he was our own Charles Foster Kane? </p> <p>From the start it was not clear what Black would do to cooperate with - or frustrate - the film. Two hours before we were to catch a flight to London we received an email from his personal secretary, Rosemary Millar, asking us to state our intentions. Everything had been going smoothly until I emailed Barbara Amiel-Black, his wife, seeking an interview. When I awoke the next morning, Millar's email was awaiting me. It said that Black was not interested in participating in the documentary. She wrote that he remained unconvinced that it was a worthwhile endeavour and if he wasn't satisfied with our response he would tell his friends and colleagues who had already committed to interviews not to do them. </p> <p>I looked at my producer and said: \"What should we do? We have 20 interviews set up. Maybe we should wait a day and see what happens?\" Despite the fact that we wouldn't receive a response until the following day, we decided to take our chances and go to London anyway. After arriving, we rushed to an internet cafe and checked our email, where the response from Millar awaited. She wrote that Black had decided not to interfere with our interviews, although he personally still did not wish to participate. </p> <p>It was amazing just how many people wanted to talk about Black. One of the themes I discovered after interviewing several people was Black's self conscious concern with his image. Former chief executive of The Daily Telegraph, Andrew Knight said: \"He was more conscious than he needed to be of what English society would think of him. Would they just think that he was a small-time Canadian? I lost count of the amount of times that he would say on the telephone - 'How did people take it? What did they think of me?' - after a dinner.\" </p> <p>In November 2003, Black and his colleagues were alleged to have taken $32m (\u00a317.8m) in non-complete payments that hadn't been approved by the board, and he is being sued by Hollinger International for $200m over \"self-dealing transactions\" and \"excessive management fees\". Earlier this summer, Hollinger upped the ante and piled on racketeering charges and are seeking treble damages of approximately $1.25bn. </p> <p>The day before Black was ousted as CEO of Hollinger, I spent around three hours with him at the Washington Press Club's book fair, where he was signing his recently released 1,134-page biography, Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom. The book fair was populated with a Who's Who of American political and journalistic movers and shakers, and plenty of has-beens and wannabes (among them Colonel Oliver North, former House majority leader Dick Armey and sex therapist Dr Ruth Westheimer.) If Black knew the axe was going to fall the next day, he betrayed none of that in public. He was extremely relaxed - charming, funny and gregarious - and consumed at least four glasses of white wine while we were talking. </p> <p>He was hawking his FDR biography with the fervour of a bible-belt preacher. Whenever someone walked away without purchasing it, he would cajole them: \"You're putting that book down? It's a bargain at twice the price.\" Then he would turn to me and say: \"It's like selling ads for the Jerusalem Post, with customers huddled in their basements wearing gas masks and eating soda crackers.\" </p> <p>As the evening wore on and the crowds dwindled, a few reporters approached Black with an occasional question. At that point his response was always the same: \"If you want to ask a question, you've got to buy a book.\" Though I had received a review copy from his publisher, which Black thought was \"devious\", I purchased another one and he signed the book: \"To Debbie Melnyk, my friendly nemesis, Best wishes, Conrad Black.\" </p> <p>Once Black was sacked as CEO, his book tour appearances took on the aura of a rockstar's. Suddenly his lengthy FDR tome was on the bestseller list. When I arrived at a book signing in Toronto, the crowd was already several hundred people deep, and gaggles of journalists crushed together hoping to get the story about his impending demise. His arriving limo was greeted by a rambunctious press scrum. </p> <p>Later, I showed up at a tour Black was doing of Roosevelt's mother's house in New York City. I couldn't understand why he was continuing with the book tour when his business was collapsing. \"I don't allow that to get in the way of my normal activities,\" he said. \"We'll sort that out.\" He then walked over to Hunter College, where he spoke about his book, but not before being inundated with more questions from a group of British and American journalist, whom he blamed for writing irresponsible copy. At one point he looked at the New York Times reporter who was trying to ask questions about the growing corporate scandal and said: \"Undoubtedly you're a Rooseveltian and that's what you want to talk to me about, right?\" The reporter didn't get it and Black said he would answer questions only if he bought a book. </p> <p>Some things we filmed happened purely by chance, but it's always that way with documentaries. I had rung up Geordie Grieg, the editor of Tatler, and asked him for an interview about Lord and Lady Black's presence on the social scene. He replied that since he was friends with Amiel, he had to ask her if she minded, but he would be seeing her that evening at the Blacks' annual summer party, which he said was starting in one hour. I immediately hung up the phone. I was desperate to get a cameraman over there to film the people arriving and departing from the party, as I heard it would be packed with the cream of London society. Luckily, I found someone and he made it from Surrey to Kensington in less than an hour. It paid off. He shot video of Prince Andrew, Nigella Lawson, David Blunkett, Elle Macpherson, Imran Khan, David Furnish, Jemima Khan and Anne Robinson, among others. </p> <p>People I interviewed seemed to have very strong feelings about Amiel. Many of the men drooled at the mere mention of her name; others couldn't say enough nasty things about her (all off-camera, of course.) However, I was struck by the deep love that Black has for his wife. Brian Stewart, a lifelong friend of Black's and one of only a handful of guests at their civil wedding ceremony in London, said: \"I think his involvement with Barbara Amiel is really the great passion of his life. It's more important to him than anything else.\" Judith Steiner, a former friend of Amiel, confided: \"Barbara said something very sweet to me after she married Conrad. She said, 'He takes care of me and I never had that.'\" </p> <p>The beginning of the end may have been Black's desire to, as one person put it, \"live like a billionaire when he was only a millionaire\". He has an unnatural sense of entitlement, which included million-dollar mansions in Kensington, Palm Beach, Toronto and New York, as well as two corporate jets, one of which Amiel decorated, for $3m, with shareholders' money. This was just the tip of the iceberg. </p> <p>As late as January, when Black believed he had succeeded in selling the Telegraph titles directly to the Barclay brothers, his emails maintained their combative, breezy tone.

  "<p>Sympathy for Lord Black of Crossharbour, the former chairman of Hollinger International, the then owner of the Daily Telegraph, was thin on the ground this week after the audacious scale of his alleged plundering became clear. </p> <p>Following a year-long internal investigation, Hollinger published a damning 500-word report on Tuesday. It outlined how Lord Black, his wife Barbara Amiel and David Radler, the company's former chief operating officer, had \"lined their pockets at the expense of Hollinger almost every day, in almost every way they could devise\", the report was widely quoted as saying. </p> <p>The lavish detail of Lord Black's alleged excesses left commentators breathless with condemnation. </p> <p>\"It would be hard to conceive of a more damning indictment of the management of a publicly quoted company than the one heaped on Lord Black yesterday,\" said Jeremy Warner in the <strong>Independent</strong>. \"Even Robert Maxwell didn't officially get it in the neck as badly as this ... This is public vilification on a scale Lord Black could scarcely have dreamed of, even in nightmare ... If he is not a broken man already this will surely break him ... The scope and arrogance of [his] pilfering is quite breathtaking.\" </p> <p>Ruth Sutherland in the <strong>Daily Mail</strong> agreed the report had done untold damage to the businessman. \"It has been a long time coming, but well worth the wait ... Amid the dry financial analysis, Richard Breeden, the former chairman of the US securities and exchange commission, who prepared the report, displays a novelist's eye for the killer observation. The glimpses he provides of the Blacks' gilded lifestyle would be good material for an Anthony Trollope or Tom Wolfe.\" </p> <p>The report accused Lord Black of \"corporate kleptocracy\" and claimed he spent vast sums of the company's money on lavish parties, designer handbags for his wife, the refurbishment of a Rolls-Royce and even silverware for the couple's private jet. </p> <p>But for the <strong>Financial Times</strong> the real crimes lay elsewhere. \"Such misdemeanours were small beer compared with the litany of corporate transactions by which Lord Black and Mr Radler ... are said to have diverted cash to themselves ... The report says they took $400m [\u00a3223m] in unjustified management fees and other devices,\" said an editorial in the paper. </p> <p>Patience Wheatcroft in the <strong>Times</strong> said Lord Black was \"not the first corporate chief to take a generous view as to which of his living expenses should be down to the company\". But she questioned what others at Hollinger were doing while Lord Black apparently indulged his lavish tastes. [He] was operating under the delusion that the business was entirely his. The non-executive directors did nothing to disabuse him of this idea.\" </p> <p>And she singled out Richard Perle, one of the non-executive directors and the former US assistant secretary of defence, for special attention. Collecting bonuses of about $3m [\u00a31.67m] seems to have damaged Mr Perle's ability to take an independent line when Lord Black made his demands. He obligingly signed off on them, and now looks likely to pay a heavy price.\" </p> <p>The Lex column in the Financial Times agreed that the Hollinger report raises questions that go beyond Lord Black and his immediate circle. If the allegations are true, it underlines how badly things can go wrong when an overbearing chief executive has voting control over a company through a dual-share structure. All board members in effect owed their positions to Lord Black, knowing that he could vote them off. Minority investors had no real protection, although they should have been aware of the risks associated with investing in a company with such a shareholder structure.\" </p> <p>But all the commentators agreed the future now looks bleak for Lord Black. As Warner said in the Independent: \"[He has] lost his business, his lifestyle, his wealth, his position in society, his friends in powerful places and his reputation ... Lord Black at least retains his freedom ... [But] reading this catalogue of misdemeanours, you have to wonder for how much longer.\"</p>",
  "The sacked Blairite union leader Shaun Brady was privately supported by a government minister and rail company director in his battle with leftwingers for control of the industrially powerful Aslef train drivers' union, according to private correspondence seen by the Guardian. <p>The transport minister Kim Howells, and BAA, operators of the Heathrow Express link, were accused last night of interfering in the running of the Labour party affiliated union. </p> <p>In a handwritten message to the Aslef general secretary in April, Mr Howells, the minister of state responsible for the rail industry, said he was unable to attend the union's annual conference in Scarborough but he sought an urgent chat with Mr Brady, \"so that you might fill me in on the situtation re the national executive\". </p> <p>Potentially more damaging to Mr Brady's hope of overturning last month's dismissal after a disciplinary hearing is the disclosure that the inaugural speech he was to have delivered to the conference in June was written by a senior manager. </p> <p>An email marked \"private and confidential\" shows that the 12-page address, including a strong attack on the executive, was produced by Stephen Hardwick, BAA's director of public affairs. </p> <p>The involvement of an employer in the writing of a union leader's keynote speech is highly unusual if not unprecedented in recent years, and the Aslef general secretary faces charges of collaborating with bosses. </p> <p>Aslef called strikes on the Heathrow Express last year under Mr Brady's leftwing predecessor Mick Rix, and the company's involvement will fuel suggestions that rail companies secretly campaigned to defeat Mr Rix in an Aslef election last year. </p> <p>Andy Reed, Aslef's national organiser, said: \"You have to ask yourself how is it that the general secretary of Aslef had so few allies in the union that he had to use a bosses' mouthpiece to write his speeches? </p> <p>\"Our members will want to know why employers, ministers and government advisers were invited to interfere in our union's internal affairs when it is our duty to be wholly independent to represent our members.\" </p> <p>Mr Brady, who is planning to appeal against his sacking afster May's now infamous barbecue punch-up with the president, Martin Samways, in the garden of union-owned flats next to its Hampstead headquarers, rejected the allegations last night </p> <p>He said he had never met Mr Howells to discuss his confrontation with the executive. The BAA director's aid with the speech, never delivered because the Aslef conference was postponed, was received in a personal capacity after Mr Hardwick's involvement was proposed by a mutual political contact, a figure the Guardian understands is a Labour MP. </p> <p>\"I asked him to help me, I just needed a bit of assistance. Certainly it was nothing to do with BAA,\" said Mr Brady, who met Mr Hardwick twice, once to discuss the speech and then to receive a 12-page draft. </p> <p>Mr Rix, on holiday in Scotland, said: \"I said when the election result was announced that we had been beaten by powerful and vested interests and that dark forces were involved. </p> <p>\"These revelations prove that there was collusion and a concerted campaign by employers and some politicians, not only to remove me from office but to destabilise and wreck a proud and historic trade union.\" </p> <p>Mr Hardwick, who advised the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, when he was in opposition, said he wrote the address in a personal capacity. </p> <p>\"I have got no relationship with Aslef. I was asked to write a speech by a friend to help out someone who he supported.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Howells said: \"It was nowhere near interfering with the internal workings of a union.\" </p> <p>Mr Brady accused Aslef opponent of leaking letters to undermine his appeal. </p> <p>\"This is not a witch hunt against me, it is a witches' coven. They are trying to twist an angle against me. There was no deceit. If there was deceit in this, there would be no emails,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>A live music renaissance is under way in Britain, according to a new poll commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The poll, conducted by Mori, found that almost half of pubs, clubs and restaurants had featured one or more live acts in the past year. An estimated 1.7m gigs were staged across England and Wales. </p> <p>The report, which will be used by the government to measure the impact of its controversial Licensing Act, also found that a third of those staging live acts believe the legislation will have a positive impact on their industry, as opposed to 11% who plan to cut down or stop booking performers under the new rules. The legislation (which also relates to the selling of alcohol) will sweep aside the \"two in a bar\" rule, whereby no entertainment licence is required if there are two or fewer performers on stage. </p> <p>According to licensing minister Richard Caborn the poll proves \"the new laws will create more opportunities for budding musicians\". However, Keith Ames of the Musicians' Union wonders if the government has shot itself in the foot. \"With the situation this healthy, it will be difficult for the Licensing Act to have any positive effect. But if it doesn't increase the number of gigs, what's the point of it?\" </p> <p>Ames is happy with the findings, which show \"people have had enough of manufactured Pop Idol creations. You can get music so cheaply on the internet, people have become blas\u00e9 about recorded music. But there's greater excitement than ever about live performance.\" And as for the Licensing Act, \"We're still not bananas about it,\" says Ames. \"But we're going to try and make it work.\"</p>",
  "Russia last night called an emergency session of the UN security council as it sought to drum up international support for its battle against the sudden upsurge in terrorist acts committed by suspected Chechen militants in the past eight days. <p>Andrei Denisov, the Russian ambassador to the UN, requested the evening meeting to secure formal international condemnation of the kidnapping of scores of children in a school in southern Russia. </p> <p>The White House was swift to offer Vladimir Putin support. \"We stand with the Russian people,\" a spokeswoman for George Bush said last night after the US president put in a personal call to his Russian counterpart. </p> <p>\"Both leaders stressed their strong commitment to working together to defeat global terrorism,\" the spokeswoman said, in a message the Kremlin interpreted as an offer of American help in its own war on terror. </p> <p>Yesterday's attack on the school in Beslan, North Ossetia, followed a suicide bombing outside a Moscow metro station the previous day and last week's double bombing of two passenger aircraft. More than 100 people have been killed. </p> <p>Analysts said the UN move was aimed at shoring up international support for any military action Russia might take against militant attacks. </p> <p>Russia is unlikely to approach the UN for logistical support in any military action, given its proud assertion that the Russian military can deal with the Chechen problem. Yet a UN security council resolution backing Russia's right to take military action to secure its population from the terrorist threat would silence critics of its continuing military actions in Chechnya. </p> <p>It could place any future military activity on a par with Washington's decision to invade Afghanistan after September 11, with which last week's double plane crash has been compared. </p> <p>The Kremlin had remained silent for hours after news of the attack on the Beslan school, struggling to square its fiery rhetoric about vanquishing terrorists with the potential public outrage at a bloody outcome to its second major hostage crisis at the hands of militants in two years. </p> <p>Just before news broke of the Beslan crisis, President Putin reiterated that Russia would have no truck with terrorists. Reacting to the suicide bombing in Moscow, he said he was prepared to talk to anyone in Chechnya, bar separatists and terrorists. </p> <p>\"There can be no dialogue with those who wanted to fight and who made war a way of earning money,\" he said. \"We shall fight against them, throw them in prisons and destroy them.\" </p> <p>President Putin's top two law enforcement ministers, security service head Nikolai Patrushev and interior minister Rashid Nurgaliyev, were sent to the Beslan school to take command of the rescue operation. </p> <p>The Kremlin faced considerable public criticism for its handling of the boldest terrorist act to hit the Putin presidency: the October 2002 Dubrovka theatre siege in which more than 800 theatregoers were taken hostage by 40 gunmen. </p> <p>The siege was ended when special forces released a gas into the building, killing 129 hostages and the gunmen. The victims' relatives remain incensed at how opaque the events of the siege remain and the poor medical care given to their relatives immediately after the event. </p> <p>Mr Putin's opinion poll rating slumped recently to its lowest since he sought re-election in March. His image as a man of stability and order lifts him above his competitors, yet he cannot afford another show of Russian force to end in hundreds more dead hostages.</p>",
  "Tony Blair yesterday placed \"seven key policies challenges\" - designed to improve opportunity and security for all classes - at the centre of Labour's strategy for winning a third term. <p>He used a brief speech to party workers at Labour's HQ in Westminster to reject any suggestion that the government can campaign either on its record or on Conservative failings. \"The key to renewing our political support for the coming years is policy,\" Mr Blair declared. </p> <p>One No 10 aide explained: \"We want to keep up the momentum we had before the August break. It's policy that drives the politics.\" </p> <p>Explaining that economic stability, high employment, reformed public services and constitutional modernisation had been the main Labour challenges since 1997, Mr Blair listed the new policy areas: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> wider economic and educational opportunity for a \"larger majority\" as Europe faces growing US competition; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> personalised public services that meet higher voter expectations for health and education; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> doing more for the minority of poor people and neighbourhoods amid affluence; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> balancing tougher law and order policies with respect for civil liberties; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> promoting retirement \"as an opportunity not a threat\"; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> tackling immigration abuses while defending multi-culturalism against extremism; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> building international support for vital policies such as climate change. </p> <p>Mr Blair said: \"There is one key test that every policy decision should pass. Does it, in practical terms, advance and improve the lives of Britain's hard working families in the future? Does it help provide opportunity and security for them in a world of constant and rapid change?\" </p> <p>Though the prime minister offered no specific new remedies he promised initiatives in a dozen policy areas over the next six months - ranging from cutting red tape for business and better vocational education to universal childcare options for the under-fives and better pensions planning. </p> <p>Dismissing his critics as peddlers of \"the politics of pessimism and anxiety,\" Mr Blair twisted the knife in Michael Howard who was also in campaign mode yesterday. </p> <p>\"This responsibility to address the future clearly is ever more important to us as, frankly, the Tories flounder, incapable of the bold renewal, top to bottom, that their party needs. Only this party, Labour, is facing the future with confidence,\" he claimed. </p> <p>It is Mr Blair's conviction that the Tory leader is an attack dog without a strategic vision who is quickly coming to grief. Speaking during a walkabout in Hove yesterday, Mr Howard warned that politically correct attitudes and red tape are preventing the police from doing their job properly. </p> <p>\"We are told that it will take seven minutes on average for a police officer to fill in the forms, and we are not talking about stop and search here. </p> <p>\"We are talking about every time a police officer simply stops someone in the street and says 'what are doing here and where do you live?'\" Mr Howard said. </p> <p>It was Mr Howard's bad luck that he attacked Labour's anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) on the very day they were praised by the Daily Telegraph. Mr Blair, though not all Labour MPs, will take comfort from that.</p>",
  "<p>Lunch with David Aaron always was an extravagant affair. Personal finance journalists would be invited to the very best restaurants - Le Gavroche was a favourite - while, more often than not, his chauffeur would wait outside in a Bentley parked on double yellow lines. </p> <p>No vintage wine was too expensive, no tip too extravagant. Slipped in with the dessert would be an attempt to push his latest \"educational\" guide to financial products. The journalist would also be plied with financial incentives, such as lavish commissions to write for his in-house magazines. </p> <p>Most were put off by his oleaginous approach. Some weren't, and they will be feeling uneasy today. The Financial Services Authority, which yesterday called its investigation into Mr Aaron's affairs \"one of the most serious cases of mis-selling that it has investigated\", highlighted how his brochures were endorsed by journalists labelled as \"independent experts\". Yet the public who were sent these mailshots were not told that Mr Aaron paid for these opinions. </p> <p>No Guardian journalist is among those implicated by the FSA. The newspaper did accept a fee from Mr Aaron to sponsor two investment guides in 2000 that we published. The Guardian retained complete editorial control, and it was felt at the time that an independent financial adviser as sponsor was more acceptable than a product provider. It was a matter of judgment whom we picked as sponsor, and with hindsight it was ill-advised to select Mr Aaron. For that we apologise. </p> <p>This short-lived relationship did not stop our independent approach to dealing with Mr Aaron. A year ago, the Guardian's Jobs &amp; Money published a detailed examination of Mr Aaron's flawed selling methods, which named the journalists whose endorsements he so relied upon. </p> <p>Mr Aaron made repeated (and unsuccessful) attempts to block publication. The article brought a torrent of letters from readers who had suffered huge losses at the hands of the Aaron Partnership. When the Guardian continued to investigate Mr Aaron's affairs, this investment salesman brought in the famous Peter Carter-Ruck &amp; Partners. </p> <p>Carter-Ruck warned that it would sue for libel, given the \"false basis\" of the reports written by Tony Levene. It included the line: \"Our clients are astonished that you should seek to question the independence of the two experts who commented on the precipice bonds.\" It alleged that we were giving \"misleading advice\" to readers, adding: \"We urge you to check your facts with us.\" </p> <p>The FSA has now checked the facts. Perhaps Carter-Ruck should have taken more care, given its client's precarious financial position. Thousands of Aaron's victims have suffered serious financial loss. It is appropriate that Carter-Ruck is also out of pocket: the slippery Mr Aaron never paid the lawyer's \u00a35,932 bill. </p> <p><strong> Minor discomfort </strong><br> </p> <p> Rupert Murdoch does it, as does Lord Rothermere. The saintly Kay Graham at the Washington Post did it, as do her heirs. The list of media companies controlled by founders who own just a fraction of the business could go on and on. </p> <p>These dual-class share structures seem particularly fashionable among media moguls. Murdoch has argued consistently that the arrangement has allowed him to make long-term decisions for the good of the company, as well as for the good of his family. But there will always be a flip side to this, namely the risk that a controlling minority shareholder will act in his or her interest alone. </p> <p>This week's extraordinary allegations over the way Lord Black ran his Hollinger newspaper empire show just how dark that flipside can be. With 30% of the equity Black controlled 72% of Hollinger International. Thereafter, he seems to have proceeded to simply do what he wanted with the company's money. </p> <p>His behaviour was an aberration; the likes of Murdoch, Rothermere and the Graham family have built impressive organisations and rightly continue to enjoy gilt-edged reputations. But investors in the public markets will never be wholly comfortable with their financial structure. </p> <p><strong> On the rack </strong><br> </p> <p> Brace yourself for bad news from retailers in the coming weeks. Yesterday's figures from the Nationwide, showing house prices coming to a shuddering halt, are evidence that higher interest rates are finally taking their toll, or hitting the mark (depending on whether you are an estate agent or Mervyn King). </p> <p>That the impact has also filtered through to the high street was made clear in Tuesday's CBI retail survey. As the CBI noted, this year's appalling weather will not have helped. </p> <p>Retailers, as we have pointed out many times, are double gold medal winners when it comes to blaming the elements for their failure to shift racks of overpriced/overbought/unfashionable/poor quality tat. </p> <p>But this summer's deluge will have done serious damage, and the details of who has been hit hardest will emerge in the coming weeks as companies release interim results.Yesterday, the jeweller Signet was among the first to admit to a poor August, but there will be more. Woolworths and Marks &amp; Spencer are among those said to be hardest hit.</p>",
  "<p>It is now a truth universally acknowledged that the British housing market is in want of reform. The average house costs over \u00a3160,000, and, on standard mortgage multiples, the average person cannot afford even half of it. If housebuilding remains at current levels, houses will remain unaffordable not only to the few, but to the many. </p> <p>We need to resolve the conundrum in which everyone wants to see their children properly housed, but no one wants extra houses near them. Can this be resolved? I believe so.</p> <p>At present, government and councils decide first where housing should be, and then the land is bought. For a start, that is the wrong way round: deciding where to build houses increases the value of that land tremendously, creating windfall gains for the owner. </p> <p>A typical 90 hectare farm in the south east rises in value from \u00a3500,000 to \u00a3250m if planning permission is granted. That is ridiculous, but if the council owned the land first, it would gain the \u00a3249.5m profit for local people - surely enough to turn many 'nimbys' into 'imbys'.</p> <p>Councils should invite landowners to submit bids, stating which land they are prepared to sell, and at what price. Once the possibility of massive gain disappears, many farmers would sell land for double its value, and almost all for, say, five times its value. At that price a typical south-east farm worth \u00a3500,000 would sell for \u00a32.5m, surely incentive enough to make many farmers willing sellers. </p> <p>The council would choose which land to buy, taking into account not only price, but access to transport, the vitality of local shops and communities, and so on. The council would control where housing was to be built. </p> <p>Unlike now, the council would trade off the advantages and disadvantages of building houses in different places, against the profit it could make for the community. A council that will build only in one place will still pay a high price for land. But a council prepared to allow housing in a number of locations - say, new small towns or villages - should be able to buy land very cheaply. </p> <p>Since people like living close to the countryside, building new towns and villages is, as the Town and Country Planning Association has argued, often preferable to expanding existing towns. </p> <p>Let's take a typical place in the south east, Horsham, as an example of how this would work. Imagine Horsham district decided to allow 0.4% of its area to be built on - 200 hectares, or two reasonable-sized farms. That is enough for 5,000 houses. </p> <p>At current land values Horsham council would make a profit of around \u00a3385m from buying and reselling the land - enough to abolish council tax altogether for five years. Horsham is not an extreme case - the gain to the community in housing hotspots would be considerably greater. </p> <p>I am sure that the people of Horsham do not want to see 0.4% of the area built on. But the prospect of zero council tax for five years must be attractive to politicians and voters, and should be incentive enough.</p> <p>Such a system has good incentives, and is self-regulating. The incentives to build are - as they should be - greatest in housing hotspots. And as more houses are built, the gain to the local community falls, so councils will allow less housebuilding. There is no danger of overbuilding.</p> <p>Any advocate of housebuilding will be accused of wanting to \"concrete over our countryside\". Such scaremongering is absurd, and condemns many people to live in unsuitable and unaffordable housing. No commentator is talking about building on more than a couple of percent of land in the south east. </p> <p>Nor is it clear that housebuilding is environmentally damaging. Sheffield University has found that, unlike intensively managed farmland, \"gardens are brilliant for wildlife\" and, remarkably, have greater biodiversity than tropical rainforests. The only thing that is unsustainable is the environmental case against housebuilding. </p> <p>Nor is this system suitable only for greenfield sites. In areas of peak housing need, such as Oxford, industrial land sells for \u00a31m per hectare and residential land for \u00a38m a hectare. If Oxford, London, and similar places are prepared to see industrial land converted into housing - and most such areas have very low unemployment - they too can set a zero council tax. And few people prefer factories to houses at the bottom of the garden.</p> <p>More reasonable house prices mean that people - especially young people - will be better housed. More reasonable house prices also mean that nurses and teachers can, as in the old days, buy a house without needing a handout from the state. And of course, if house prices are more reasonable, the housing benefit bill goes down. </p> <p>More people properly housed. Easier key worker recruitment. Lower housing benefit bills. Massive cuts in council taxes. Surely this is worth doing?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tim Leunig is a lecturer in economic history at the London School of Economics</p>",
  "Britain's first organised count of bugs splatted by cars has produced \"alarming\" evidence of a national decline in insects, or alternatively a Darwinian improvement in their skill at flying out of harm's way. <p>The huge exercise in popular science, which recruited more than 40,000 people to check corpses on their front numberplates throughout June, recorded an average of one insect fatality every five miles, well below expectations.</p> <p>A total of 324,814 flies, aphids and moths died for science during the 30-day exercise, which saw families, schools and a respectable corps of professional entomologists use a \"splatometer\" designed and patented by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.</p> <p>The gold star for effort went to a lorry driver who kept records of 105 journeys, stopping every 40 miles to take data. Another enthusiast sent in empty film canisters filled with dead bees found at the roadside during June walks.</p> <p>\"Because this is the first survey of its kind, we can't yet say definitively that insect numbers have declined,\" said Richard Bashford of the RSPB, who kept up volunteers' spirits with his own splatlog on the group's website. \"But something worrying is going on, and potentially there will be an impact on our bird population. Britain's 23,000 species of insects are their bread and butter and the consequences of a decline have serious implications.\"</p> <p>The survey followed a smaller trial in 2003 which proved the practicability of the splatometer, a cardboard measuring grid used after each journey to count the evidence on numberplates. Future surveys are likely to see more sophisticated attempts to discover precisely what is being splatted, and where.</p> <p>Volunteers who did identify corpses found that greenfly and blackfly formed the bulk of the victims, with common moths such as the yellow underwing flying to their doom after dark. This year's mass invasion of hoverflies also contributed its share, and other relatively frequent corpses were bluebottles, lacewings and flying ants.</p>",
  "<p>British rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters, hailed by successive governments and water companies as some of the cleanest in Europe, are in such poor ecological shape that many may fail new water quality laws. </p> <p>Preliminary assessments by the Environment Agency yesterday suggest that although the overall chemical quality of water has improved in the past decade, hundreds of rivers and lakes are still being seriously polluted by sewage, fertilisers, and sheep dip pesticides. Many more areas are adversely affected by land drainage, over-abstraction of water, flood embankments and urban pollution. </p> <p>The maps introduced yesterday show that 20% of all English and Welsh rivers are in danger of failing laws to comply with the new EU water framework directive, because of pesticides. One in 10 rivers has too much water taken from it for drinking or farming. </p> <p>The agency estimates that 40% of all rivers are threatened at some point along their lengths, that 10,750 miles of river are being polluted by towns, and that almost all rivers in north-east England show significant pollution from old mine workings. </p> <p>It said that it could cost \u00a36bn-\u00a312bn over 20 years to reach the standards required by 2015. But the money should be more than repaid by the savings made in health, pollution, and even flooding costs. </p> <p>\"The current standards were set in 1976,\" said Martin Griffiths, head of the water framework directive at the agency. </p> <p>\"The new directive sets high ecological standards and will give added protection for drinking water. </p> <p>\"It costs a lot more to clean up water than it does to protect it. The new standards will benefit fishermen, recreation users and wildlife.\" </p> <p>Sarah Oppenheimer, policy adviser to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: \"The new directive takes the view that water cannot be healthy if you have to treat it with masses of chemicals before you drink it, if it's not safe to swim in, or if fish, plants and insects cannot live in it. </p> <p>\"At the moment the public is losing out three times. It subsidises the farming sector while it continues to pollute water, it pays for pollution through the loss of wetland, wildlife, fisheries and bathing waters, and it pays again to install expensive treatment plants to remove the pollution to make the water fit to drink.\" </p> <p>The directive, widely seen as the most significant piece of European water legislation for 20 years, requires man-made pressures on the water environment, such as sewage discharge and water abstraction, to be managed differently. </p> <p>\"Using chemicals to treat other chemicals - what we do at the moment - is not a long-term answer,\" Ms Oppenheimer said.</p>",
  "When Samia and her twin sister, Samira, choose what to wear for the first day of term this morning, they will be making more than a fashion statement.

Schoolgirls who arrive wearing the headscarf will be sent home, and repeated breaches of the newlaw will result in expulsion. </p> <p>France's politicians have stressed that they will enforce the law, despite the demands of the Islamic Army of Iraq, which has transformed this already controversial subject into a question of life and death, threatening to kill two French journalists unless the legislation is revoked. </p> <p>Given the sensitivity of the debate, many Muslim organisations which had previously campaigned against the law have called for calm. They are keen to avoid intensifying French antipathy to the country's five million Muslims by appearing to sympathise with the demands of extremists. </p> <p>Dozens of pupils are nevertheless thought to be planning to arrive at school this morning wearing the veil. \"Imagine how you would feel if the government passed a law telling you not to wear trousers to school,\" Samia, 17, who declined to give her surname, said. \"For me, this is both an issue of religious conviction and of modesty.\" </p> <p>She is frustrated by the way the legislation appears to target Muslims. \"A small cross, which is what most Catholics wear, counts as a discreet sign of faith. A headscarf doesn't. I don't feel as if we're being treated equally,\" she said. \"It's a shame that I have to spoil my good academic record because of my religion.\" </p> <p>Even before the hostage crisis, the debate over the veil split the nation in surprising ways. Some prominent Muslims supported the law as a way of boosting integration; anti-racism organisations have stressed the importance of secularism in school, and feminist groups approved the ban on a symbol of repression. Others saw it as an example of religious intolerance, an abuse of human rights and an attack on the Muslim population. </p> <p>Critics warn that instead of clarifying an unclear situation, the legislation risks enflaming new tensions. Until now, individual schools have had discretion over how they enforced France's secular principle. </p> <p>But just as the Qur'an is open to interpretation on whether the veil is an essential element of religious practice, France's new law appears susceptible to a variety of interpretations. </p> <p>A telephone hotline has been set up in Strasbourg by Muslim groups, offering advice on how to exploit loopholes in the legislation. Volunteers explain that pupils should be able to get away with wearing relatively small handkerchieves over their hair. </p> <p>\"We've had calls from about 40 girls who are undecided. They are anxious about having to make a choice between their education and their religion,\" said Nora Tarifoult, one of the women running the call centre. </p> <p>The growing trend for the veil was not, she insisted, a reflection of rising radicalism, but simply a sign that second generation immigrants were more confident about displaying their religion. </p> <p>Expulsion remains an unlikely outcome for Samia and her sister because both are prepared to compromise. \"If the director of the school tells me to wear a beret, I'll wear a beret instead,\" Samia said.</p>",
  "<p>For some mysterious reason, I was not one of those asked this week by the right-wing thinktank Civitas to become a shareholder in its new model school in north-west London, an educational initiative necessary, in part, to stem the rot of a culture \"in serious decline - one might say meltdown\". </p> <p>However, as a long-time resident of the area in which the new model school will open its doors later this month, I did get its arresting yellow leaflet announcing its intention to set up a school promoting \"the values and knowledge on which the survival of the culture depends\" and calling for local support. </p> <p>Parents felt alternately intrigued and irritated. More than 100 people attended a fractious meeting in February, at which some dared to suggest that Civitas was playing on middle-class fears of the racial mix in local schools, the so-called \"playground effect\". In recent years, this patch has become packed with middle-class families, many of them staggering under the burden of high mortgages. But this is also Brent, one of the most multicultural boroughs in the country; inevitably, the schools reflect that. Civitas surely knew exactly what demographics, and what buried sensitivities, it was targeting with its offer of a \u00a33,000-a-year education based on \"Judaeo Christian\" values. A private education with moral knobs on. </p> <p>Despite that packed February meeting, the new model school has so far failed to recruit many entrants. According to news reports, only 10 parents have signed up. Hence, the need for this week's appeal to potential shareholders, and the warnings of imminent global moral collapse. </p> <p>One can only speculate why so few parents have taken up the Civitas offer; low-cost, \"no frills\" private schooling. But one answer may be a somewhat surprising level of parental support for local schools in Brent. </p> <p>Despite a significant drain to the private sector in this area and a never-ending debate about the problems of the state sector, there exists among local parents a sense that something really important hangs on the success of our local schools: social cohesion in the inner city, no less. One can sense in their attitude towards the local school something between a belief and a yearning for a sense of community, as well as a wish to come to terms with, rather than shy away from, the complexities of the modern world. </p> <p>Our daughters' school, a large mixed primary, is minutes away from the sports complex where the new model school will open its doors on September 13. More than 70 languages are spoken; new refugees arrive almost weekly. The 600 or so pupils come from every imaginable social, ethnic and religious background. </p> <p>In a funny way, our large red-brick primary is a kind of faith school, proud of its secular take on its own social and ethnic mix. Such a sense of excitement and celebration is perhaps easier to sustain at primary level, where the brute power and tricky problems of adolescence have not yet intervened. But where it works, a genuinely mixed, local school daily embodies the wish for, the struggle towards, fairness, tolerance and the chance of higher standards for all, not just those endowed with \"social and cultural capital\". </p> <p>Much of this depends on capital of the more basic sort: resources, plus a managing intelligence. At our local primary there is an on-site refugee centre, a strong behaviour policy, and a burgeoning sports and arts programme. There is also an active parental culture. </p> <p>Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world. But it is in the grind and pleasure of such everyday cooperation that the abstract value of community finds specific and positive meaning. And surely not just in Brent: such an experience is being repeated, largely unreported, in inner cities around modern Britain. I'm not sure what Civitas means by \"Judaeo Christian values\" but my re-readings of the Old and New Testaments find as much justification for the world view our school promotes as Civitas no doubt finds for the errors of mass migration or the moral failings of the divorced. </p> <p>Children at our local primary also get the chance to develop what Civitas calls \"social skills and good character\", only as well as traditional good manners they get a grasp of complex religious difference and the vast inequalities in the world we live in. What our school cannot offer is maths to an \"adequate standard for the Common Entrance exams\", French for the very young, and a reading age of eight by the age of five. </p> <p>I remain curious as to why so many undoubtedly anxious local parents have, so far, failed to take up Civitas's offer and why so many seem to have opted instead for the more complex and uncertain adventure of the local school, the noisy truth of community. </p> <p>Perhaps the playground effect works both ways; it is its thrill, rather than its threat, that has swung it for them. Like me perhaps, they prefer the prospect of lively collaboration, the chance of a range of unexpected friends and experiences, over the rigid certainties of 10 bent heads in a rented sports hall. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Melissa Benn is co-editor of a book of essays on education and democracy to be published by Continuum press this month </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mbenn@dircon.co.uk\">mbenn@dircon.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The war has lasted for most of 10 years, and with each year that passes, Islamist separatists have had to sink to ever greater depths of brutality to get their cause noticed. Chechnya - a war the Kremlin reignited to boost the political career of an unknown former KGB officer, Vladimir Putin - today returns to haunt the Russian president. <p>Yesterday's seizure of a school in the southern town of Beslan, in the volatile republic of North Ossetia, caps a bloody week for Mr Putin, whose usual take on the conflict is that it is \"getting better\". </p> <p>Two planes and a metro station have been attacked, and now he must achieve what seems impossible: the safe extraction of up to 400 schoolchildren from a mined gymnasium. They are being held by 17 Islamist extremists, well-versed in Russian siege tactics, ready to die, and demanding the unacceptable - the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya. </p> <p>In the name of giving Russian civilians a taste of the suffering Chechens have endured at the hands of Russian soldiers, separatist militants have held hostage the sick in hospitals, and theatregoers. They have dispatched suicide bombers to rock concerts and hotels, and onto aircraft and rush hour metro trains. Yet few could comprehend what they hoped to gain by targeting primary schoolchildren. </p> <p>The Beslan gunmen have targeted a region already fraught with ethnic tensions. The North Ossetians are a fierce contingent in the North Caucasus. Their relations with the neighbouring Muslim Ingush have yet to recover from a war 13 years ago.Ingushetia has recently seen serious fighting and \"anti-terrorist\" operations by Russian troops who believe militant separatists have found a foothold there. The headstrong North Ossetians will not take kindly to seeing their children held hostage by the same people who would bring their holy war to their homeland. </p> <p>As little as three months ago, the Chechen separatist movement appeared to have fractured irrecoverably. Russian officials claimed separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov's inner circle were slowly surrendering. The Russian security services, the FSB, even said Mr Maskhadov was himself abroad, perhaps in Turkey, along with his commander-in-chief, Shamil Basayev. </p> <p>The Chechen people - despairing after 10 years of Russian bombing, sharia law, and brutal disappearances and extra-judicial executions by Russian troops - appeared willing to tolerate Moscow's rule, if it meant peace. </p> <p>A pro-Moscow president, Akhmad Kadyrov, was installed last October and his vicious grip, enforced by his oafish son, Ramzan, did for many provide a set of rules under which they might find stability. Yet on May 9, Mr Kadyrov was assassinated by a bomb blast, for which Mr Basayev claimed responsibility. </p> <p>Mr Kadyrov's policy of buying up militants to serve under him had contaminated the republic's security forces with separatist sympathisers. It became easier for militants to move around the republic and attack Russian troops. This not only angered the military, but some said it even led to the collapse of security that allowed a bomb to be placed under Mr Kadyrov's seat in Grozny stadium on Russia's VE Day. </p> <p>The Kremlin's attempt to turn Chechen against Chechen had self-combusted, leaving a separatist movement brimming with internecine rivalry. At one extreme were those \"traitors\" who would take Moscow's money, and on the other those who sought alliance with internationalised Islamist extremists. </p> <p>The exiled Mr Maskhadov has been rendered largely irrelevant by this week's attacks. It may - or may not be - his fighters attacking Russian troops in the hills daily. Yet his spokesman's insistence that the separatists had nothing to do with the double plane crash on Tuesday was a turning point. It showed Russia's fight against terrorists can no longer involve negotiating with, or even \"neutralising\" Mr Maskhadov. </p> <p>The Kremlin's long-repeated claim that their fight in Chechnya is against groups linked to al-Qaida has proved to be self-fulfilling. Since September 11, the west has chosen to turn a blind eye to Moscow's suppression of separatist sentiment in Chechnya, believing there was a greater fight against Islamist extremists at stake. As Mr Maskhadov was disowned by Washington, hardliners in the rebel camp assumed a greater role. </p> <p>Now a new cast of militants people Russia's wanted posters. Abu Walid, a Saudi-born hardliner, has regularly been named as the shady mastermind of suicide bombings across Russia until his family said he died in combat earlier this year. The FSB believe he may have faked his own death and gone to organise Islamist resistance in Iraq. Another foreign citizen, Abu Yasin, is now performing Mr Walid's old role, they suggest. </p> <p>The claim fits the slow internationalisation of the conflict. The irony is that, while the Chechen conflict may not have started as a struggle involving Islamist fighters, it is one now. The gunmen who seized the Dubrovka theatre in October 2002 said they reported to Mr Maskhadov. The Islambouli Brigades, who claimed responsibility for the plane bombs and the metro attack, say they wish to \"punish infidel Russia\" and to help their \"Muslim brothers in Chechnya\". </p> <p>Two years ago Moscow faced an enemy with a clear leader who sought a basic and definable objective: Chechen independence. Now it has allowed this enemy to morph into extremists who are ready to die - and kill anyone from soldiers to schoolchildren - to punish Russia and bring infinite holy war to it. </p> <p>Two years ago, Moscow had someone with whom it could negotiate. Now, in Beslan, it faces impossible demands, mined schoolchildren, and 17 gunmen who have kept their mobile phone turned off.</p>",
  "<p>There was another of those \"Growing crisis over the teaching of science\" moments this week. Pupils' science performance has apparently slumped with national curriculum test results showing that 11 to 14-year-old's grasp of science is deteriorating. The target for teenagers reaching the standard for their age will be 80% by 2007. The figure has fallen to 66%, missing the current target of 70%. So is it time to rebrand science in schools? </p> <p>One of the reasons that kids don't do science A-levels is supposedly because they're too fact-packed and hard. And it's true, most science is hard. But this is not evidence of dumbing down or lack of intelligence in our youth. If anything, it's the reverse. Here's the logic. I need good grades to get into university. I don't get marks for trying hard to understand an equation that takes four hours to master. Nobody is going to tell me that my D in physics is an extraordinary achievement for me, just compare it unfavourably to that of a maths genius swot who has got an A. So, when I'm choosing my options at 14, it's better to take softer subjects where I know I'm likely to get a better grade. Who could fault that argument? Grades are king. </p> <p>Facts are a bit of a touchy subject. I frequently talk to science educators who like to tell me that science is not fact-based, as everyone supposes. They mutter about scientific uncertainty, they say that there are no absolute rights and wrongs, there are shades of opinion and often mention cosmology as an example of a science built on theory, not fact. It's all very commendable except no one seems to have mentioned this to examiners. There is no arguing the toss about the circulation of blood through the heart with an examiner. Either you know it, or you don't. </p> <p>And there's another thing. Our youth finds creativity attractive and glamorous. Scientists want us to think of science as creative and indeed the best scientists are every bit as creative in their thinking as artists, but somehow creativity and innovation are strangled out of the science curriculum. For which headteacher in their right mind is going to allow the science department to let students loose on interesting projects and risk poor grades, when you know exactly how to get an A grade with that tedious old \"resistance of a wire\" experiment? </p> <p>But back to science being too hard. There are other \"hard\" subjects - for instance a law degree requires as much mugging of facts as any science, and can be every bit as dry, dusty and indigestible. But law doesn't stand up, wring its hands and say apologetically \"we aren't fact-based\" and \"nobody loves us\". The truth is that our youth can do the compare and contrast thing. Starting salaries in law hover around \u00a330,000 and the chances of serious money are considerable. But check out the science jobs pages. There you'll see ads which ask for a degree, a doctorate and two years post-doc experience (er, is that eight years of my life?) which pay \u00a319,000 and, get this, only last for 22 months. Who but a stupid person would take science on that basis? I fear I can already hear the chorus of professorial geysers bursting, so let me move swiftly to the solution. </p> <p>Science must be rebranded. From now on, physics is to be known as Extreme Science (strapline: Are you hard enough?). It is to be awarded an automatic A grade, with an immediate A* award if Extreme Science is taken with Creative Accounting (formerly known as maths). Physicists may like to consider a bit of rebranding themselves. Institute of Ultimists perhaps? Chemistry should be awarded in several versions that advertise that they are fact reduced. Organic Lite would be the first on offer, while a Krototype exam, Inorganic Lite is developed. Both would also attract an automatic A grade. The full portfolio of Extreme Science, Chemistry Lites and Creative Accounting would qualify for automatic university entry, plus no fees and a chance to be Dr November in the annual Stud Muffins of Science calendar. </p> <p>All scientists with grungy clothing, beards and pasty faces are to be banned from making public appearances and use of the word science or scientist in the media would attract a hefty fine from Ofcom. </p> <p>Finally all academic science job adverts are to be banned and retrospective job beaming is to be instituted. In this scheme, every person with a SET degree who gets a job in science that they love and is paid a fortune, gets their salary, photo and job description beamed automatically to every school science department in Britain. Alternatively, we could all just tell everyone we know what a fantastic, diverting, engaging, thrilling subject science is. Oh, and lie about the money.</p>",
  "Searching for the lost Ark of the Covenant? Curious about the location of the Holy Grail? A nondescript street in west London may be the place to start looking. Like many of the most enticing headquarters, it's a public building: the old Post Office Savings Bank, where 7,000 clerks once toiled. Used as a set for the New Avengers, it now houses the physical legacy of Britain's march from the industrial revolution. <p>This is Blythe House, the archive of the Science Museum. The museum galleries that you can see every day are home to some 15,000 objects, with the same amount kept in the Large Objects Store, a warehouse near Swindon. But Blythe, behind the Olympia exhibition centre, is the motherlode: more than 170,000 items secreted on shelves stretching from one side of the building to the other , all neatly tagged, boxed and catalogued. And, from this week, the museum will take guided tours around the stores for the first time; we own the stuff, after all. </p> <p>Organising the four floors is Xerxes Mazda, 39, the museum's manager of collections access. There is no natural light. The windows are blocked off, \"so that we preserve the objects - preserve the temperature and control the humidity\", says Mazda, who handles everything, no matter what size, with a pair of white cotton gloves. </p> <p>\"Memory feeds imagination,\" said Amy Tan, and if a nation has a collective memory, this is it. There are things here that exist nowhere else on earth. </p> <p>Significant objects are everywhere. The aeronautics floor, among the copper-covered radar mini-planes and the ejector seats, hosts a collection of the wind tunnel models used during the development of Concorde, including a free flight model taken up by a helicopter. It is part of the enormous number of objects originally from the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in Farnborough, where the problem of metal fatigue in aircraft flying at great speeds was discovered. \"During the cold war, Farnbrough had computers in advance of anything else in Britain,\" says Andrew Nahum, curator of flight. </p> <p>Opposite an unsettling rubber dummy used to test ejector seats underwater, hidden down an aisle, is a prosaic-looking piece of battered painted metal. It's part of the upper fuselage from one of the world's first commercial airliners, the De Havilland Comet. </p> <p>But this particular piece is from G-ALYP, which crashed off the island of Elba in 1954 with huge fatigue cracks around the automatic direction-finding hatches. It was the second to crash, and the entire fleet was grounded later that year. By the time the problem was remedied, the Douglas DC8 and the Boeing 707 dominated the air. It sits not far from the GPS unit of a chopper shot down in the 1991 Gulf war. \"All the things that are quite interesting always look like nothing special,\" says Mazda. </p> <p>There's the unexpected, too, such as the collection of lathes. One of them belonged to Charles Babbage, whose Difference Engine is regarded as one of the precursors to the first computer. </p> <p>\"Ornamental turning was carried out by gentleman amateurs,\" says Ben Russell, curator of mechanical engineering. Parts of the lathe were built by Babbage's engineer, Joseph Clement - presumably before the two fell out and Babbage refused to pay him. </p> <p>The store is also home to the Oxford heliometer from the Radcliffe Observatory, installed in 1848. Designed to measure the diameter of the sun, the split lens micrometer was adapted to make precise measurements of star positions using parallax motion. It was the first large example of this sort of instrument to be used in England. An individual telescope is a beautiful object - particularly the one stored in a glass case from the Royal Society mission to observe the transit of Venus in 1769. But the sight of a multitude of telescopes, amassed like the spiky office furniture in an Ikea furniture warehouse, is overwhelming, a monument to determination. </p> <p>Often the contents are odd. Deep in the bowels of the basement, among the surgical instruments that are part of the collection of items left by Henry Wellcome, behind the amputation kits and the tonsil guillotines (do what they say on the tin) are two drawers best described as items removed from the person. There's the \"ring removed from the penis of an idiot\" after 48 hours \"with considerable difficulty by means of metal-cutting forceps\" or the toothbrush \"swallowed by a male lunatic, 62\". It stayed there for 14 days until the patient underwent surgery. The label notes baldly that although the patient recovered, \"on being transferred to the Maudsley [psychiatric hospital] he cut his throat\". </p> <p>It's a museum of tragedy as much as anything else: the key example being the prosthetic limbs room, with its collection of first world war false legs, and a pair from 1977 designed for a thalidomide baby. </p> <p>The quantity is staggering. Not far from the dentistry room with its smell of mouthwash, collection of toothless skulls and dentists' chairs, there's a chamber filled almost entirely with forceps used by midwives, and another of shelves lined exclusively with pestles and mortars. In the x-ray machine room, there's a pedoscope - used in shoe shops for parents to see how their children's feet fitted their shoes. There's also an iron lung room. Iron lungs were the first life support system and helped paralysed people to breathe. They were widely used during the polio epidemic of the early 1950s, and some people had to spend the rest of their lives in them. </p> <p>There are grimmer discoveries among the dials and buttons of medical equipment here. On one shelf is a silver-coloured device which looks like a primitive stereo amplifier. It includes several dials on which a patient's vital measurements would be entered before a needle would swing toward one of two readings: \"survive\" or \"IBD\" (irreversible brain damage). Mazda points out that the \"London hospital survival predictor\" was never used to determine whether life support should be withdrawn. </p> <p>This is about how people live, and the collection reflects that. It is practical science: not the big developments, but the incremental ones that never make the papers. Mazda says: \"It says far more about the history of science and technology than it does about the science museum.\" </p> <p>Although most of the museum's exhibits are sought out, two or three pieces are donated every day. On receiving them, the curators compare them with their hitlist of items, and eventually the objects make their way into the galleries or onto the shelves at Blythe house. The museum has to be selective, says Mazda, as the process of deselecting an item is long and complicated. </p> <p>It is like an enormous junk shop. A drawer with a condom maker in it is situated near one with an ice skate made out of a sheep's jawbone. But if these items aren't saved here, where would they be preserved? The answer is that they would probably disappear forever. </p> <p>\"You can't put a dome over the whole world,\" Mazda says, wistfully. \"I wish you could.\" </p> <p>Further information about Ingenious: Tours of the Stores, a year-long series of curator-led tours, can be found at <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/ingenioustours\">www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/ingenioustours</a>.

  "At first glance, the prospects for this month's TUC Congress look decidedly menacing. The agenda for the Brighton gathering provides a litany of complaints of promises not kept and trust betrayed. There are calls for a restoration of full employment \"from day one\" and for the repeal of every aspect of Conservative employment legislation. One motion condemns plans to cut civil service jobs. Another provides a blanket condemnation of marketisation, privatisation and choice - the ideas on which Tony Blair's public service reform is predicated. <p>And yet as the prime minister prepares to address the unions on September 14 he may be more sanguine than people realise. Over the past two months the fractious relations between government and the union movement have improved. Considerable work has taken place behind the scenes. </p> <p>It had to be done, because two months ago the protagonists, in the words of a union official, \"looked into the abyss, and decided not to jump\". The crisis reached a head at a Downing Street meeting on June 8 involving Tony Blair and Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary. Blair was furious with the unions for suggesting they would oppose the EU constitution because its fundamental charter of rights did nothing new for workers' rights. They were furious with him after several cabinet ministers sought to reassure business that it did nothing new for workers' rights. A stand-up row ensued between a usually unflappable Blair and a usually unflappable Barber. </p> <p>Both sides realised they had to pull back. At Labour's national policy forum in Warwick they did. The unions left the meeting with specific but potentially important pledges, from ensuring that bank holidays are not docked from statutory annual leave to extending the restrictions on sacking striking workers from eight to 12 weeks. They are also investing hopes in a commission under Margaret Prosser looking into the earnings gap for women. These are small, incremental changes, but together they might add up to something. \"Warwick changed the mood,\" says one senior union official. \"We now have to see if these pledges are acted on.\" </p> <p>The No 10 approach has been to grant limited concessions on employment rights, while refusing to budge on either its reform agenda for public services or on collective employment rights. Blair is using his Europe terminology, calling these his non-negotiable \"red lines\". </p> <p>Personal relations between the prime minister and the new group of inexperienced, but radicalised, union bosses remain cool. Each of the big four union bosses has, in his own way, denounced Blair. And yet now there is a sense that, in spite of this, an accommodation has to be reached. \"The new generation of leaders don't have any personal loyalty to Blair,\" says one senior union figure. \"They may not have moved against him over Iraq, but the war legitimised their thinking that they owe him nothing and they don't have to be deferential towards him.\" Set against that, however, is a realisation that Derek Simpson of Amicus, Kevin Curran of the GMB and Tony Woodley of the TGWU will, for the moment at least, have to find a way of working with Blair. </p> <p>Behind the scenes the talking has continued. The Foreign Office has its own liaison group with unions, at which bangers and mash were served in the grand building - a telling piece of symbolism. Cooperation by the DTI and the DfES towards the unions is good. </p> <p>Yet the broader political atmosphere makes it uncomfortable for either side to advertise this. Union leaders are not supposed to brief the press after meeting Blair or his ministers for fear of antagonising business. One of the frustrations among union-friendlier ministers is the recent approach of business organisations. Unlike the US, where the Democrats remain successful at mobilising what they would call \"progressive business\", the CBI, after trying to sound moderate, has reverted to type, seizing on any crumb of comfort accorded by government to unions as a throwback to the old days. This compounds Blair's dilemma in the knowledge that he will tilt towards business when pressed. </p> <p>With an election looming, money is concentrating the mind. Labour finances are healthier than for some time, thanks to Lords Sainsbury and Grayson, but the party still depends on the unions' largesse for about half its funds. So far, the RMT and the Fire Brigades' Union have disaffiliated, with the GMB making veiled threats. </p> <p>At least as important, with party membership rolls down, is help on the ground in campaigning, not just for the election but also for a referendum on the EU constitution. Both organisations have considerable internal problems. The TUC will announce membership figures at its conference that are expected to show a drop of 200,000 to under 6.5 million - the lowest since 1944. Individual union rolls are falling. The drop in revenues makes it more difficult for union leaders to advocate handing over large sums to the Labour party. </p> <p>Warwick could prove, as one government adviser thinks it will, \"a watershed\" in producing a genuine partnership. Alternatively, it could mark just a fleeting moment in a period of otherwise wasted opportunities over the past seven years. And yet for all the talk to the contrary, for all the brinkmanship, the two organisations are more interdependent than either cares to admit. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Kampfner is political editor of the New Statesman and author of Blair's Wars</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jkampfner.net\">www.jkampfner.net</a></p>",
  "Penalties for marginally breaching speed limits are to be lowered in some cases, Alistair Darling, transport secretary, proposed yesterday, bowing to the chorus of public complaints that the current system is arbitrary, inflexible and shaped to raise taxes rather than create safer roads. <p>This year 3 million speeding offences will be recorded and motorists penalised with lost points and fines.</p> <p>Just fewer than 1,000 pedestrians were killed by excessive speed last year, with the government claiming on the basis of research published this summer that 40% of lives have been saved by speed cameras. </p> <p>But the Conservatives have latched on to cumulative punitive fines for speeding, incursions into bus lanes, and failing to pay congestion fees as examples of motorists being punished. </p> <p>Mr Darling, angering the road safety lobby, said that motorists caught speeding just above the relevant limit may in future be given lower penalties or ordered to undergo the alternative of taking remedial driving courses. </p> <p>Mr Darling said the drivers might get only two penalty points, as opposed to three, for marginally breaching the speed limit. Penalties could now range between \u00a340 and two penalty points for less serious offences and up to \u00a3100 and six points for more serious offences, especially speeding in 20mph limits set up to protect schools and neighbourhoods. </p> <p>The changes, designed to lift the fear of a total ban from the frequent motorist, will replace the \"one-size fits all\" approach, Mr Darling said. They will not require primary legislation and follows previous indications of a more flexible policy on penalties for speeding </p> <p>Critics claim the number of camera fines has increased from 400,000 in 1998 to 2 million last year. But the number of road deaths has remained about 3,400 a year. Last year it rose slightly to 3,508. </p> <p>The RAC pointed out that its research indicates that 72% of drivers still think speed limit enforcement via safety cameras is more about raising revenues than improving road safety.\" </p> <p>The shadow transport secretary, Damien Green, urged the government to go further by backing an independent audit of the position of every speed camera and a review all limits. </p> <p>But Brigitte Chaudry, founder of the RoadPeace organisation, whose son Mansoor, 26, was killed by a speeding motorist, said: \"These proposals could lead to more deaths. It could be that drivers will only get two penalty points for going at 39mph in a 30mph area. That's not a fraction over the speed limit - it's a long way over it. </p> <p>\"Our research shows that al most half of Britain's motorists admit to speeding a little over the speed limit every day.\" </p> <p>As an alternative to fines or penalties, \"speed awareness courses\" nationwide will be offered by the department of transport for people such as first-time offenders in the lower speeding category. </p> <p>Mary Williams, chief executive of road safety group Brake, said: \"We are appalled at this proposal, which flies in the face of the facts of speed. </p> <p>\"At just 35mph the risk of death on impact with someone on foot or bicycle is far, far higher than at 20mph, which is a far safer limit in heavily built-up areas, and common in other European countries. </p> <p>\"Our already excessive 30mph limits are not targets that drivers should be allowed to float around with minimal penalty.\" </p> <p>She said: \"We have a terrible speed culture in the UK, where 59% of drivers routinely break urban 30mph limits. </p> <p>\"With 888 people dying on foot and bicycles every year, and with an urgent need for 20mph limits, not 30mph, in these areas, it is an absolute disgrace that the government is basically saying it's all right to speed a little bit'. </p> <p>In 2002-3, fines from speed cameras and other speeding fixed penalty notices raised a minimum of \u00a369m.</p>",
  "<p>With Service Pack 2 for Windows XP - essentially XP2 - now shipping in volume, Jim Allchin, the Microsoft executive in charge of Windows, can finally turn his attention to the next version: Longhorn. </p> <p>Allchin decides what Microsoft can ship, and when, then makes it happen. And while we don't know what he is thinking, several things emerged in a press release last week. The first was a broad target date of 2006, which we hope means the calendar year rather than Microsoft's fiscal year. The second was that Longhorn will not include the new \"future storage\" system, WinFS. </p> <p>Making the date will be tough for Microsoft, since it is expected to produce operating systems that will also run on hundreds of millions of existing PCs. Many of these have been assembled with little or no reference to Microsoft, and sometimes with little in the way of quality control. This necessitates a very large beta test, which is likely to take at least a year, and makes it almost impossible for Microsoft to include any surprises. </p> <p>However, the finances of hundreds of thousands of suppliers will be critically affected by the result. The important ones are computer manufacturers and software developers - Microsoft's main customers - who depend on having new hardware and upgraded applications to sell. Whether it will make much difference to users is another matter, but customers vote with their wallets: if Microsoft can't come up with a compelling upgrade, it costs users nothing to keep their hands in their pockets. </p> <p>It could be a struggle. Longhorn was once intended to be a blockbuster upgrade: one independent analyst even compared it to the shift from MS-DOS to Windows. Delaying WinFS removes one of the main planks supporting that idea. </p> <p>Microsoft also removed two other planks last week: Avalon, the graphics subsystem, and Indigo, the web services platform. These have not been dropped. However, rather than using them to make Longhorn more compelling, Microsoft has decided to make them available for Windows XP as well. </p> <p>As a result, Allchin will find that what he can actually ship in 2006 is much less of an advance on XP2 than he must have hoped. </p> <p>This is great news for XP users. First, they will have had five years of operating system use for their money, from 2001 to 2006-07, with the real limit being the useful life of the hardware. Second, they will have had a string of useful updates including Microsoft.net and web services support, new graphics subsystems, new media players, improved Wi-Fi and Bluetooth software, and much else besides, while paying not a penny extra. </p> <p>It's also great news for Windows developers, who will have a much larger market for software that exploits Avalon and Indigo. </p> <p>It's hard to see why a commercial company should not have packaged all this stuff differently and, like Apple, tried to sell us all a couple of expensive upgrades. On the other hand, I don't think anyone would argue that Microsoft actually needs the money.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comments to <a href=\"mailto:online.feedback@theguardian.com\">online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>Headhunter: Redemption <br> PS2/Xbox, \u00a339.99 Sega, <br> *** <br> The original Headhunter game was released at the end of the Dreamcast console's short life. This meant that approximately five people bought it, probably in the vain hope of prolonging the DC's existence. Sadly, they failed, but it was obvious to those who played it that Headhunter was a decent game. For a start, the hero had a beard, rode a motorbike and was called Jack Wade. </p> <p>He was a man's man in a videogaming world increasingly dominated by females (Lara was still relevant then). But in this sequel, he is accompanied by a ballsy lady sidekick called Leeza X. Players get to play as both characters, especially Ms X, which adds some variety. The changes in style aren't subtle - Jack tends to punch his enemies, while Leeza does intricate cartwheels to avoid bullets. </p> <p>As before, this is a third-person game that sees each of your characters attempting to save the world. Yes, it is yet another gaming plot seemingly specced out on the back of a memory card down the pub. But at least the music is good, lending gravitas to the poorly translated dialogue and movie sequences. </p> <p>The plot of the original game involved a deadly virus called Bloody Mary. Attempting some of the later sequences in Redemption may require one, as the action gets incredibly frustrating. Wobbly control makes a sniping section appalling, while some of the puzzles are ridiculously obscure. But Redemption has its moments. <br> <strong> Greg Howson</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Aura: Fate of the Ages</strong><br> PC, \u00a319.99 Streko Graphics, The Adventure Company<br> *** <br> The fact that it's published by The Adventure Company could fool you into thinking this is an adventure game. Actually, it is more like a string of puzzles with a loose plot draped around them. Nor is it particularly adventurous, unless you lead a markedly unexciting life. </p> <p>The story revolves around a young man called Umang, who is on a quest to recover a series of magical artefacts before the obligatory bad guys get to them. This means travelling to various dimensions and, basically, pulling knobs, levers, switches and a variety of other oddments. </p> <p>The puzzles themselves are quite good and combine elements of music, colour, shapes, basic arithmetic and a healthy dose of luck. Umang also has a notebook of sketches offering hints for the various puzzles, but while some are helpful, others are practically puzzles in their own right. </p> <p>The developer has certainly taken some care with the graphics, which depict steam-punk landscapes and contraptions. It's just a shame you can only move where the game wants you to go, rather than being free to roam around. <br> <strong> Rhianna Pratchett</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Case of the Silver Earring</strong> <br> PC, \u00a329.99 Frogwares/Digital Jesters<br> ***<br> Digital Jesters is the newest UK publisher on the block, but its first offering belongs to a resolutely old-fashioned genre: the point-and-click adventure. </p> <p>As such, The Case of the Silver Earring's gameplay consists of piloting a character who can speak to other characters and collect and combine objects. At least, in this case, that character is the legendary Sherlock Holmes. At times you get to play Watson, too. </p> <p>The plot, dialogue and visual atmosphere are commendably authentic. As well as wielding his trusty magnifying glass, Holmes can analyse evidence in his study at Baker Street. </p> <p>Like all such adventure games, this is likely to appeal to a more mature audience, involving, as it does, brainwork and patience, rather than action or instant gratification. But it is well-written, has been expertly assembled and will run happily on PCs of a certain vintage. </p> <p>Hardly essential, but if you are a fan of Conan Doyle or just like your games soothing rather than adrenaline-inducing, you should find it pretty meaty and satisfying. <br> Steve Boxer</p>",
  "One of Rodgers and Hart's greatest hits, Falling In Love With Love, was first sung in the 1938 Broadway production of The Boys From Syracuse by Muriel Angelus, who has died aged 95. The New York Times critic thought her portrayal of Adriana in this musical adaptation of The Comedy Of Errors \"a monument to precariously controlled wifely patience\", and that she sang \"with exquisite sweetness\". Unfortunately, her sweetly exquisite soprano voice was heard too seldom in a career that began at the age of 12 and ended at 33. <p>Born in London of Scottish parents, the blonde Muriel Angelus Findlay began singing in music halls before entering films in 1928 in the silent The Ringer, the first of three versions of the Edgar Wallace play. A year later, she was in Germany for Maskottchen, based on an operetta by Walter Bromme, in which she played \"the other woman\". If the producers had waited a few months for sound, they could have included the songs. </p> <p>In her first talkie, Night Birds (1930), she got to sing a number in a West End revue, in which a detective, on the trail of her fugitive boyfriend, disguises himself as a chorus boy. More serious was Hindle Wakes (1931), the first sound version of Stanley Houghton's 1912 play, where Angelus portrayed Beatrice Farrar, the respectable fiancee of Alan Jeffcote, a Lancashire mill-owner's son, who refuses to go away with him for a naughty weekend. Instead, he takes a mill girl, only to return to Beatrice after the girl remembers her \"place\". Jeffcote was played by the Scottish-born actor John Stuart, whom Angelus married during the shooting of the film. </p> <p>They then appeared together in Let's Love And Laugh (1931), an inconsequential comedy-drama in which she was the daughter of a publisher, and he an aspiring writer. She then embarked on several farcical comedies, some directed and starring Monty Banks (Mario Bianchi), the husband of Gracie Fields, with titles such as My Wife's Family (1932), So You Won't Talk (1935), and Blind Spot (1932), in which she played an amnesiac, a melodrama Angelus would have wanted to forget. </p> <p>In 1936, she starred in the Eric Maschwitz stage musical Balalaika at the Adelphi Theatre in London. Angelus was ravishing as Lydia, a ballet dancer and singer, who falls in love in Paris with an exiled Russian prince after the Bolshevik Revolution. It was the sort of thing that went down very well in the West End in the 1930s, and it ran for over a year. It led to Angelus being offered the role of Adriana in The Boys From Syracuse, and a contract with Paramount, for whom she made four prestigious films. </p> <p>The first was William Wellman's The Light That Failed (1939), the second remake of the Rudyard Kipling novel, which tells of the desperate attempt of a painter (Ronald Colman) to finish his greatest painting - of a prostitute (Ida Lupino) - before he goes blind. In a moving scene, Angelus, as the now blind artist's girlfriend, has to hide the fact from him that the painting has been slashed by the prostitute in a jealous rage. </p> <p>Of the three last films she made, all in 1940 - Safari, a studio-bound jungle melodrama with Douglas Fairbanks Jr as \"the best hunter in West Africa\"; The Way Of All Flesh, in which Angelus was a thieving adventuress; and The Great McGinty - the last is by far the most memorable. In this, Preston Sturges' first feature, about a tramp (Brian Donlevy) who becomes state governor by craft and graft, Angelus played his secretary, offering to become his public wife for the sake of the \"women's vote\". Angelus triumphs as the sole character with half a conscience in one of Hollywood's best satires. </p> <p>After another success in a Broadway musical, Early To Bed (1943-44), as the madame of a bordello in pre-war Martinique, which people, for reasons known only to the librettist, keep mistaking for a girls' school, Angelus left show business. In 1946, long divorced from Stuart, she married Paul Lavelle, the conductor of the Radio City Music Hall orchestra. </p> <p>Fifteen years later, Lavelle and Angelus recorded Tribute To Rodgers And Hammerstein, in which, naturally, she sung Falling In Love With Love. She is survived by her daughter from her second marriage. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Muriel Angelus, actor, born March 10 1909; died August 22 2004</p>"
