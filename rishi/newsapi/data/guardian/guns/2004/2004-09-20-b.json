  "<p>Ricky Ponting gave the weary half grin of a fellow who could see the questions coming as readily as a kid's googly. It must be interminable: whoever Australia play will always be measured against the benchmark that his side and those of his three predecessors as captain have set. They are the gold standard in both forms of the game. </p> <p>So, he said, it is not really for him to say how other teams shape up against his. Suffice to say that they strive to keep their noses in front, and to date, believe that to be the situation. </p> <p>Today at Edgbaston, though, England get the chance to rectify a one-day losing streak against them that began one January evening in Adelaide 5 years ago, when Darren Gough alone of the current England side was playing, and has continued for a further 13 matches. That is a lot of defeat and no reward, something that ought to carry with it some heavy baggage. </p> <p>Ponting believes Australia must have a psychological advantage over and above that created by their exalted position as World Cup winners and losers only seven times in 38 completed games since then. </p> <p>It is a view with which the England captain Michael Vaughan disagrees, whatever the disparity in achievement between the Australians and his own evolving side. \"We are certainly not going into the game thinking about that string of defeats,\" he said at Edgbaston yesterday. \"After some disappointments this winter we feel that we came back strongly against India, and if we perform to the standards we have set in the past few weeks, we can put Australia under real pressure.\" </p> <p>England, results notwithstanding, have experience of doing just that in the last two matches contested by the sides. Australians prefer to look on the second final of the VB Series two years ago, and the World Cup match in Port Elizabeth that followed a few weeks later, as evidence of a lack of English fibre. </p> <p>On both occasions, England had Australia under the cosh, down and all but out. In Melbourne they were 216 for six chasing 230 to level the series, only for an inspired Brett Lee to blow them away: the last four wickets fell for eight runs. In the World Cup, Australia were 135 for eight chasing 205 before Michael Bevan and Andy Bichel contrived to see them home. </p> <p>England should have won both matches but the significance is that they put Australia under pressure in the first place: they appear to have more nous about them now and would be less likely to let such situations slip again. </p> <p>There is no denying that if Australia play to their standards, they will beat England no matter the conditions or the result of the toss. The recent damp weather will further enhance their chances because in Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz and Brett Lee (the latter a likely inclusion at the expense of Shane Watson) they have a four-man pace attack that can outbowl England's while their batting and fielding are stronger. </p> <p>One-day cricket is a great leveller, though. The new ball appears to have offered assistance in both first and second innings, but there is something psychologically pleasing about playing the game on your own terms. </p> <p>And then there is the Freddie and Steve Show. Steve Harmison, the world's leading fast bowler, has removed a burden from his shoulders with his decision not to tour Zimbabwe and will have no distractions, either on him individually or the team as a whole. </p> <p>\"Steve has made his decision,\" said Vaughan, \"and we respect that. It is a tough one because we all realise the position we and the ECB have been put in. But there is no split in the camp. This game is in the forefront of our minds and we will remain a unit.\" </p> <p>It is to be hoped that others find it in their conscience to follow Harmison's lead, among them Andrew Flintoff, the impact of whom can be matched by no player on the planet at present. His astounding century against Sri Lanka last weekend helped England through to their semi-final. </p> <p>\"The way he played at the Rose Bowl was phenomenal,\" said Vaughan. \"We certainly have a match-winner in him and if he plays well he can do it against any opposition on any pitch. He is in full control of his game at the moment.\" </p> <p>Flintoff's status in the game is second to none. A statement against Zimbabwe (not to mention the platitudes of his employers and the Professional Cricketers' Association) and, like his best mate, he will be seen as a strong man of principle as well.</p>",
  "<p>On Saturday night Hal Sutton, his United States Ryder Cup team 11-5 behind after the four-ball and foursomes series and facing the possibility of demolition, was asked a simple question and gave a simple answer. </p> <p>The question was: who would he expect to stand up and lead the way out of the hole that had been dug for them by Team Europe. \"Tiger, of course,\" replied the US captain and left it at that. </p> <p>Later, when Lee Westwood heard of that exchange he was contemptuous. \"You know,\" he said, \"if Bernhard [Langer] had been asked that question, he would have said: 'All 12 of my team will lead.'\" </p> <p>That was a large part of the reason why Europe routed the Americans - not just in the four-balls and foursomes but in the singles too, the series in which the US traditionally fight back. Europe won by 18 points to 9, taking the singles 7 to 4 and establishing a record mark for any European team. </p> <p>They also equalled the margin set by the US when they won at Walton Heath in 1981 with a team that contained 11 men who were, or became, major championship winners. This European team had no major champions but was undoubtedly the strongest side ever put together on this side of the Atlantic. </p> <p>The Muirfield Village team of 1987 might have had six major winners but it deteriorated rapidly after that. This team was not only strong all the way down, they were all in form as well, although it has to be said that the margin of victory was something of a surprise. </p> <p>This was a team in every aspect of the word and, when the champagne came out after they had won, there was a childish delight among them at what they had achieved. </p> <p>Afterwards there was pride that everyone had gained at least a point and a quiet satisfaction that victory had been achieved with a team so young that many of its players can expect to go on and play six or more Ryder Cups. </p> <p>Sergio Garc\u00eda, at 24 playing in his third Ryder Cup, got 4 points; Luke Donald is 26, Paul Casey 27 and Ian Poulter 28. Furthermore there is 24-year-old Justin Rose waiting to regain form and Graeme McDowell, who almost made it this time, is only 25. Rapha\u00ebl Jacquelin and Fredrik Jacobson, both in contention this time round, are 30. </p> <p>There is a large pool of talent and it is going to get larger. Golf is expanding so rapidly throughout Europe the standard of play required just to get on the European tour is high. </p> <p>It led John O'Leary, a British Ryder Cup veteran from 1975, to comment after looking at the team lists for a foursomes: \"This is the first time I have been able to say that the four players we have had to leave out are better than the four the Americans have omitted.\" </p> <p>It was that realisation that enabled the European team, particularly its leaders in the shape of Garc\u00eda, Westwood, Darren Clarke and Colin Montgomerie to play relaxed golf, to let their games flow, in a manner that not even the likes of Woods or Phil Mickelson achieved. </p> <p>Those latter two, particularly when paired together on the first day, were noticeably tense. It was obvious that Woods, a control freak, did not enjoy having a player of Mickelson's calibre so close to him. </p> <p>Woods likes to be able to say, metaphorically: \"I make the jokes around here.\" David Toms put it graphically. He said: \"[The Europeans] play like they're going for a beer. We play like it's the only golf tournament in the world.\" </p> <p>Langer's captaincy was an enormous factor in the win. Paul McGinley put it well when he said: \"It's often said in books and so forth that, if you could put Jack Nicklaus's head on the shoulders of an average player, that player would become really good. Well, it's a little bit like that this week with Bernhard. We've gained a lot of benefit from his presence on the golf course. He's given us advice about course management and club selection and the pin positions all the way round.\" </p> <p>So Europe have now won four of the last five contests and kept the cup on seven of the past 10 competitions and the Americans are getting desperate. One thing they should do is to adopt the European method of deciding the automatic places, using a 12-month period instead of the current two years. </p> <p>Had they done that this time, Chris Riley, Kenny Perry, Toms and Fred Funk who got a total of 2 points between them, would not have made the team, having gathered most of their qualifying points in 2003. </p> <p>Instead they would have had, automatically, the Open champion Todd Hamilton, Steve Flesch, John Daly and Scott Verplank, all of them in form and with something to add to the team. </p> <p>As the players broke up late on Sunday night an American reporter, seeking to console Perry, who played only twice and lost both times, said: \"You know, the European dominance has to end some time.\" Perry, a man with a naturally mournful face anyway, replied: \"It may not. We may just keep on losing.\" </p>",
  "<p><strong> 1. Vikram Solanki: See off Glenn McGrath</strong></p> <p> Vikram Solanki's latest reincarnation has renewed hope among the many who had sadly concluded that he was too loose to forge a successful England career. He has averaged nearly 40 this summer in five ODIs, and might yet become an inspiration to Britain's Anglo-Indians. </p> <p>But Glenn McGrath - even McGrath at the tail-end of his career - will test the extent of Solanki's improvement to the limit. New Zealand were one ball away from ending McGrath's mediocre new-ball spell prematurely; minutes later, he had three wickets and the match was as good as won. </p> <p> <strong> 2. Michael Vaughan: Go back to basics</strong></p> <p> Michael Vaughan conceded yesterday that his one-day form had been \"a bit indifferent\". His average has plummeted to 23, and even though Australia's captain, Ricky Ponting, agrees that \"he is too good a player not to work it out,\" England urgently need answers. </p> <p>Vaughan could do worse than study videos of India's Rahul Dravid to remind himself how technical excellence can bring one-day success. His excessive desire to innovate has resulted in some costly misjudgments, the latest against Sri Lanka at the Rose Bowl on Friday. He needs to expand his game, not reinvent it. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Andrew Flintoff: Play it again, Fred</strong></p> <p> Vaughan called Flintoff's hundred against Sri Lanka \"phenomenal\" and sees him as \"a player in full control of his game - a batsman who can score against any opponent on any wicket.\" </p> <p>But Australia represents the ultimate challenge. They have not missed an opportunity to suggest that Flintoff is bearing an onerous responsibility, that he is short of support, that he cannot remain successful for ever. A couple of steepling blows over the pavilion would suggest that the force is still with him. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Ashley Giles: Silence the critics</strong></p> <p> In England, Ashley Giles commands new respect. The barrackers who briefly made him consider retiring from international cricket this summer were silenced with the most productive Test-bowling spells of his life. He can now fire it into the rough outside leg-stump with English nods of satisfaction at his durability. </p> <p>But Australians refuse to change their tune. Start a conversation about, say, Italian architecture and, minutes later, they still are harping on about how England are crazy picking Ashley Giles. It will take a stack of wickets to shut them up. He could start with a couple today. </p> <p> <strong> 5. The England side: Prove you can field</strong></p> <p> This sounds a bit of a long shot. England have two dashing outfielders in Solanki and Paul Collingwood and even Solanki has dropped two comfortable catches in this tournament. As for the Australians, tuition from Mike Young, a former baseball coach, has toughened throwing arms and encouraged perpetual aggression and accuracy. </p> <p>England should remind themselves that this Australian side is getting old. Whatever Australia can achieve, in their advancing years, England need to emulate. And, if the first three catches go to Collingwood, all the better.</p>",

  "US jets bombed a militants' checkpoint in Falluja at the weekend as frustrated military commanders appeared to be moving closer to an all-out offensive against the city. <p>At least four people were killed in the attack, the latest in a series of near-daily bombing raids conducted by the US in Falluja in the past two weeks. </p> <p>The US military said this latest target was an illegal checkpoint manned by militants linked to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Islamist extremist who leads Iraq's most violent insurgent group. </p> <p>\"Evidence indicates Iraqi citizens have been kidnapped at such checkpoints, taken to outlying areas where they were forced to dig their own graves and then executed,\" the military said. </p> <p>Another four Iraqis were killed in Falluja yesterday in gunfire from US armoured vehicles. </p> <p>Operations against the militants, who in effect control the city, have been stepped up in recent weeks. Both the Iraqi government and the US military are desperate to pacify Falluja ahead of national elections scheduled for January, but the task looks ever harder. </p> <p>In June the second most senior US military officer in Iraq, Lieutenant General Thomas Metz, told the Guardian he planned that by September or October most of Iraq would be under \"local control\", patrolled and policed by Iraqi security forces, not the US military. </p> <p>Yet since June the insurgency has grown and now controls huge chunks of western Sunni Iraq, around the insurgent bastion of Falluja. Local control, particularly in these areas, seems further away than ever. </p> <p>Earlier this month Gen Metz told the Associated Press that a major offensive was coming, either against Falluja or one of the other trouble spots in Iraq, including Sadr City, the Shia slums in eastern Baghdad. </p> <p>Yesterday a senior US military officer was quoted in the New York Times as saying that an attack on Falluja was likely. \"We need to make a decision on when the cancer of Falluja is going to be cut out,\" the US commander said. \"We would like to end December at local control across the country. Falluja will be tough.\" </p> <p>However, there is little guarantee that any fight would succeed. </p> <p>An offensive led by the US marines against Falluja in April was a failure. At least 600 Iraqis were killed and footage of the dead and dying inflamed opinion across the country. Dozens of marines were also killed and the attack was called off after three weeks before the centre of the city was taken. The insurgents emerged stronger than ever. </p> <p>Ayad Allawi, the Iraqi prime minister, has little constituency in Iraq and relies heavily on the support of the US military. </p> <p>The cost in political capital of another full-scale assault on Falluja may be too much for him to bear at the moment. </p> <p>Mr Allawi admitted last week that he has been negotiating hard with people from Falluja to try to avoid a confrontation. </p> <p>Similar negotiations in the insurgent stronghold of Samarra bore some fruit two weeks ago when the US military entered the town for the first time in weeks and began to restore a local government. Each time the government has offered millions of dollars in reconstruction funds if the insurgents leave or lay down their arms. </p> <p>Yet such talks often fail. Yesterday similar negotiations over the future of Sadr City, in Baghdad, broke down, paving the way for a return to the guerrilla warfare that gripped the area throughout the summer. </p> <p>Falluja, like most of Iraq, has seen little of the billions of reconstruction dollars pledged by the west and that in itself has motivated militants to fight. </p> <p>Mr Allawi and the American generals must now decide whether a second assault on Falluja can really pacify Iraq's burgeoning insurgency.</p>",
  "Indonesians take a big step in their transition to a full democracy today when they choose their leader for the first time in the run-off ballot of the presidential election. <p>Opinion polls indicate the incumbent, Megawati Sukarn-oputri, is likely to be soundly defeated by her challenger, retired general and former chief security minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, in a race that has been dominated by personality and devoid of meaningful policy debate. </p> <p>The campaign for the second round was limited to three days and the outdoor rallies that dominated the first round were banned. Attention focused on three dialogues in which the candidates discussed their respective visions, but only in front of academics and analysts after Ms Megawati refused to take part in a debate. </p> <p>Mr Bambang, 55, is regarded as a strong, uncorrupted leader who works hard, communicates well with people and is expected to restart political and economic reform that is perceived to have stalled under Ms Megawati. </p> <p>The president, in contrast, is seen as taciturn, often out of her depth and surrounded by a coterie of venal officials. </p> <p>She barely made it into the run-off, after Mr Bambang won the first round with 33% of the vote, seven points more than the president. Since then, Ms Megawati has increased her public appearances by opening bridges, distributing aid and interacting with the public at every opportunity. </p> <p>\"She has definitely improved as a candidate and she has closed the gap [on Mr Bambang in the last few weeks] but it is highly unlikely to be sufficient,\" said Muhammad Qodari of the Indonesian Survey Institute. \"Our polling has found that there is just too great a demand for change.\" </p> <p>The apparent contradiction in this is that for most of Ms Megawati's three-year presidency Mr Bambang was her chief security minister while his running mate, Jusuf Kalla, was her chief social affairs minister. </p> <p>\"Many of the things she is criticised for, such as corruption, lax law enforcement and a perceived deterioration of living standards, were their responsibility,\" claimed one of her closest aides, Pramono Anung. \"We believe the voters are aware of this and will give Megawati a second chance.\" </p> <p>Official returns are not expected until October 5 but the results of a quick count by non-governmental organisations should be published tonight. </p> <p>Indonesia's president was previously elected by the nation's supreme legislature.</p>",
  "Kidnappings, a shooting and the saxophone player from Spandau Ballet: forget about the football, Roy of the Rovers encompassed far more. Long before the Footballer's Wives scriptwriters started work on a soccer soap opera, the creators of Roy of the Rovers realised the value of mixing football with melodrama. <p>If anything, its plots were more outrageous. Take the time the Rovers were kidnapped by Fidel Castro lookalikes before the 1964 World Club Cup final in South America. They escape and 48 sleepless hours later they're one-nil down at half-time. Fortunately, in the absence of modern performance-enhancer nandrolone, they get hold of a local narcotic, \"Carioca Juice\", and recover to win 2-1 with a trademark Roy Race bicycle kick. Still, that's not quite as ridiculous as winning the 1986 Milk Cup with a line-up including Bob Wilson, Emlyn Hughes, and Martin Kemp and Steve Norman from Spandau Ballet. </p> <p>Roy of the Rovers started in the first issue of Tiger on September 11 1954 and became a comic in its own right in 1976. Although the bastardised name encourages many to associate Roy's team, Melchester Rovers, with Manchester United, rumour has it that Tiger editor Derek Birnage and the original scriptwriter Frank Pepper actually modelled the Rovers on the Arsenal team of the 50s. Roy himself was based on nobody. </p> <p>Of course, that didn't stop the public spotting player parallels. As another gentleman of the game who scored stunning goals, Bobby Charlton was probably the first footballer to be associated with the character and for a time his name appeared among the writing credits. \"Later Malcolm MacDonald was likened to Roy,\" says Barrie Tomlinson, who served as the story's editor between 1963 and 1990. \"His exploits on the pitch were similar but footballers followed Roy, rather than the other way around.\" </p> <p>Roy's less squeaky clean team-mates had more obvious counterparts. Roy's best friend Blackie Gray looked and played a bit like George Best and even eloped with an attractive French actress before a European Cup final, while Derek \"Mozzie\" Mostin of the 1991 line-up was based on Gazza - except that, instead of fake breasts and tears, Mozzie was famed for impersonating a monkey after scoring. </p> <p>Charlton was the first of a number of celebrity tie-ins. Geoffrey Boycott served as club chairman for three years , while Sir Alf Ramsey stepped in as Rovers manager for a short period when Roy went into a coma after he was shot in 1981. The signing of Spandau Ballet in 1985 was Tomlinson's brainchild. \"They were so big they could get anything they wanted,\" says Tomlinson: \"Apart from a place in a top league side that is. We provided that.\" </p> <p>The mix of fact and fiction was an important facet of Roy's popularity. He took a bullet in the same year (1981) Ronald Reagan and Dallas's JR were shot, and turned down a \"cool million\" to coach in the Middle East shortly after Don Revie quit as England manager for a lucrative post in the Arab Emirates in 1977. Another concession to the outside world was Roy's haircut, which went through myriad styles over the years, embracing quiffs, glam rock bouffants, mullets and even at one point a frightening Brigitte Bardot-style effort. </p> <p>More significantly, Roy of the Rovers anticipated events in football. Roy was a successful player-manager before Kenny Dalglish proved it was possible to perform both tasks and win trophies in the top-flight. Nowadays nearly every Premiership team boasts a French star or two, but Rovers recruited French winger Pierre Dupont way back in 1956, while in 1982, before Hillsborough and the Taylor report spelled the end for terracing, Mel Park became Britain's first all-seater stadium. </p> <p>Roy also blazed a trail off the pitch and became the first boy's comic character to marry when he tied the knot with the manager's daughter, Penny, in 1976. So popular was this plot that when Penny left Roy because he was devoting too much time to the club, the BBC and ITV carried the story on the national news. </p> <p>Sadly, Roy of the Rovers wilted under growing competition from television and video games and the comic stopped in 1992. Even more sadly, the legend is only likely to live on in football vernacular. Roy won't be coming out of retirement because in 1992 he lost his left foot in a helicopter crash - so his guest appearance (right) is strictly a one-off. Instead we're left to contemplate which Premiership player is most likely to do a \"Roy of the Rovers\" this season. </p> <p>\"Alan Smith is doing very well at Manchester United and he's blond,\" says Tomlinson. \"But Roy wasn't as liable to get booked.\" Nor would Roy ever break supporters' hearts in the way another candidate, Smith's new team-mate Wayne Rooney, has Evertonians'. Plus, Roy probably wouldn't know what a prostitute was, never mind the address of every brothel on Merseyside. And Thierry Henry, for all his qualifications, is simply too French. \"It's difficult to find a perfect Roy,\" sighs Tomlinson. \"Even if you combine half a dozen players together, you can't quite replicate the man.\"</p>",
  "One week past her 18th birthday, Lizzie White lives for politics. She rode a bus to Washington last year to march against the invasion of Iraq, came home to organise teach-ins and walkouts against the war at her school, and this summer was elected a model senator at a government leadership programme for girls. <p>In her final year of high school, between Spanish and calculus and swimming team practice and planning her gap year, Ms White makes calls for a Democratic congresswoman running for re-election, and has spent the weekend wearing a volunteer's apron at Wisconsin's annual gathering of peaceniks, environmentalists and other leftwing activists. </p> <p>But while she is passionate about the need for change in the coming elections, there is one cause that Lizzie White cannot embrace with her usual dedication, and that is John Kerry. </p> <p>\"I will vote for Kerry, but I don't think I will work for Kerry,\" she said. \"He doesn't grab my heart and say he is someone I need to work for.\" </p> <p>There are a lot of young people like Lizzie White in Wisconsin. She is convinced that hers is the new activist generation, a view confirmed by the Pew Research Centre, whose polling has detected more interest in the elections than at almost any time since 1972, when the voting age in America was lowered to 18. </p> <p>In Wisconsin, one of the three states in the midwest that could well decide these elections, voter registration groups have added more than 74,000 people to the electoral rolls, most of them young. </p> <p>By rights that should help Mr Kerry with an electorate which returned Al Gore by just 5,800 votes. </p> <p>Although the state has a wild streak - it produced the communist witch-hunting Joe McCarthy as well as Tammy Baldwin, the first openly lesbian congresswoman - it has backed Democratic presidential candidates in every election since 1988. </p> <p>But after weeks of intense campaigning, a CNN/USA Today poll last week showed Mr Kerry falling behind George Bush in Wisconsin by eight percentage points. </p> <p>That seems unthinkable at first in a state which has a strong independent streak and a history of political activism. During the 1960s, the University of Wisconsin at Madison was a centre of tumultuous protest against the Vietnam war, with students regularly taking to the streets to demonstrate against the Pentagon and its corporate cronies. </p> <p>Memories of those glory days brought a lot of the old activists back to the fold during the run-up to the war in Iraq. The invasion spawned more than 50 peace groups, bringing together people of Lizzie's age and an older generation. </p> <p>\"We were supposed to settle these things in the 60s when we marched the first time,\" said one activist, Arlene Wilson, from Cudahy, a satellite town of Milwaukee, at an annual meeting for progressive groups in the town of Baraboo. \"Things didn't get taken care of, so I am back again.\" </p> <p>While feeling against the war runs highest in the liberal bastion of Madison, misgivings about sending US troops overseas rippled across a state which, a thousand miles from either US coast, has developed a tradition of isolationism. </p> <p>\"In Wisconsin, there is an anti-war base larger and more organised than any other state,\" said John Nichols, editorial page editor at the Capital Times in Madison. \"I don't think there is a town in the state where you have to hide the fact that you were against the war.\" </p> <p>The anti-war signs are still plastered around the campus, and anti-Bush paraphernalia is on sale at the nearby radical shops. Democratic campaign workers are handing out Kerry stickers every few hundred yards. On one of the last days of summer, a trio of law students are revising in the sunshine. All of them see the war as the predominant issue in these elections. </p> <p>\"I think this election is going to make people our age vote more,\" said Kristen Kreple, 22, from the town of Sheboygan. </p> <p>\"It gets really heated,\" said Cathi Bartling, 22. At times, the arguments turn so fiery that they put an embargo on talking politics. Somehow, though, the excitement fails to transfer to Mr Kerry's candidacy. \"There are a lot of people, especially our age, that are going to vote for anybody but Bush,\" said Ruhee Divgi, 22. </p> <p>Commentators believe that Mr Kerry has made a number of disastrous decisions in this campaign. In autumn 2002 he took what seemed the politically expedient course and voted to give Mr Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq. This year, after voting for the war, he voted against an $87bn spending bill for the troops. </p> <p>\"Unless John Kerry opens a serious dialogue about the war - and how he is going to end it - he is going to have a problem capitalising on the vote in Wisconsin from people who are sceptical of the war, and anti-war,\" Mr Nichols said. </p> <p>Frustration with Mr Kerry's incoherence on the issue is now openly acknowledged among his colleagues in the Senate, who say it is time for him to take a stand. In effect, they are longing for Mr Kerry to return to the persona he inhabited during the Vietnam war when, as a returning navy lieutenant, he delivered a speech against America's military misadventure. </p> <p>\"How do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?\" the younger Mr Kerry said, in his 1971 testimony to the Senate foreign relations committee. </p> <p>On the campaign trail for Mr Kerry in Wisconsin at the weekend, his friend, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, practically begged Mr Kerry to reprise those words. \"I want him to say, 'How many more young American boys have to die now?'\" Mr Harkin told the Guardian. \"He has to take Bush on for misleading the US into the war on Iraq.\" </p> <p>Mr Harkin believes that Wisconsin, and the other battleground states of the midwest, are impatient to see a more aggressive candidate. \"Kerry has to draw a brighter line,\" he said. \"People need to know more about what the next four years as president are going to be like. It seems to me like he has to clearly delineate.\" </p> <p>That sense of desperation has now begun to trickle down from the Senate to the rural hinterland of Wisconsin. The northern reaches of the state are generally more conservative than the urban centres of Milwaukee and Wisconsin. </p> <p>Tony Ziesler, a retired maths teacher and engineer from the town of Ladysmith, calls it hunter country. Democrats are usually thin on the ground. But, to his delight, over the last few months there has been a rebirth of the party. At county Democrat meetings, typically supported by Mr Ziesler and three or four of his friends, attendance has swollen to 40 or 50. </p> <p>The votes are there for the Democrats; Mr Ziesler is convinced of it. \"If he could at least come out and say, 'I am going to stop the war,' that would be a resounding message for the people,\" he said. \"We still need a single message.\"</p>",
  "A millionaire businessman has been shot dead in the five-acre grounds of his stockbroker-belt house in what police believe may have been a professional hit. <p>The victim, Daniel Blackett, 36, was shot three times as he went to get the car out of his garage on Saturday evening. It is thought his attacker was waiting for Mr Blackett in the bushes near the garage. </p> <p>Neighbours said Mr Blackett's 11-year-old son and baby daughter were inside the house at Thorpe Green, near Virginia Water in Surrey, when the shooting took place. </p> <p>Paramedics arrived at the house shortly after 8pm but could not save him. </p> <p>A police helicopter and dog handlers were sent to the house, which is close to the Wentworth Estate, home to many showbusiness and sports stars. </p> <p>Officially, police refused to discuss possible motives.

  "The tale of how I became a Nazi and my Nazi harasser became a Jew is as intriguing as it is instructive. Last November I wrote a column about a racist email sent to me by an employee of an insurance company and my frustrations over the manner in which my grievance was handled. The man in question (a white, South African supporter of the British National party who complained of \"undesirables flooding into Britain\") was subsequently fired. His dismissal was not as a result of my column but because my original complaint had alerted the company to a previously unreported pattern of racist behaviour on his part. <p>Of the numerous responses from the public I received, most were supportive but many were more abusive than the original message. One stood out. Incensed that something as \"trivial\" as racist abuse could lead to a man losing his job, one reader compared me to the person who betrayed Anne Frank. And so, through contorted metaphor and contemptuous logic, the harasser became the victim and the harassed was transformed into the perpetrator. </p> <p>Victimhood is a powerful, yet contradictory, force. Powerful because, once claimed, it can provide the moral basis for redress, retaliation and even revenge in order to right any given wrong - real or imagined. The defence of everything from the death penalty to affirmative action, Serbian nationalism to equality legislation, are all underpinned, to some degree, by the notion of victimhood. Contradictory because, in order to harness that power, one must first admit weakness. Victims, by their very nature, have less power than their persecutors: victimhood is a passive state - the result of bad things happening to people who are unable to prevent it. </p> <p>In the past, the right has exploited this tension to render victimhood a dirty word - a label synonymous with whingers, whiners, failures and fantasists. Revealing no empathy with the powerless nor any grasp of historical context, they wilfully ignore the potential for victimhood to morph into resistance, preferring instead to lampoon it as a loser's charter. </p> <p>\"The left had become little more than a meeting place for balkanised groups of discontents, all bent on extracting their quota of public shame and their slice of the entitlement pie,\" wrote columnist Norah Vincent three years ago. \"All of them blaming their personal failures on their race, their sex, their sexual orientation, their disability, their socioeconomic status and a million other things.\" </p> <p>Such arguments were always flawed. But increasingly they are beginning to look downright farcical. For if you are looking for someone making political hay out of victimhood nowadays, look no further than the right. The ones most ready, willing and able to turn the manipulation of pain into an art form have found their home among the world's most powerful. </p> <p>Read the Daily Mail and you would believe that Britain is under threat from the most impoverished and vulnerable people in the land. Asylum seekers, immigrants, \"welfare cheats\" and single mothers are bringing the nation to its knees. While the country is going to the dogs, the Christians are, apparently, heading for the lions. \"We, as a people, and the government, must make strenuous efforts to promote and defend our culture, and especially the place of Christianity in it and the rights to self-expression by Christians,\" wrote Simon Heffer earlier this year. </p> <p>Across the Atlantic, the right's new role as victims is even more prevalent and pronounced. Straight relationships are threatened by the prospect of gay marriage, white workers are threatened by affirmative action, American workers are threatened by third world labourers, America is threatened by everybody. </p> <p>At times, this means the powerful appropriating the icons, tropes and rhetoric of the powerless in their entirety, to hilarious - if disturbing - effect. Last year Roy Moore, the former Republican chief justice of Alabama, led a failed bid to keep a monument of the Ten Commandments in his courthouse. Standing before a group of supporters, some of whom were waving Confederate flags, emblem of the slave-holding South, he said: \"If the 'rule of law' means to do everything a judge tells you to do, we would still have slavery in this country.\" Wearing T-shirts proclaiming \"Islam is a lie, homosexuality is a sin, abortion is murder\", they then sang We Shall Overcome. </p> <p>In these cases, victimhood serves merely as a pretext for a backlash to reassert, extend or expand the dominance of the powerful. If these people are victims of anything, it is of the threat to their entitlement and privilege. </p> <p>In others, however, genuine suffering acts as a precursor to genuine vindictiveness. The threat of suicide bombings in Israel serves as the rationale for building the wall to protect Israelis from terrorist attack. In the current intifada, the Israelis have lost more citizens than during the six-day war - no one should belittle their pain. Palestinians, on the other hand, have lost about three times as many people due to Israeli military aggression. Who, one wonders, needs protecting from whom - or is some people's pain more valuable than others'? </p> <p>But nowhere is the abuse of victimhood more blatant than in the US presidential election, where September 11 remains the central plank of the Republicans' strategy for re-election. The fact that their campaign begins with the terror attacks is not only understandable but also, arguably, right - this is the most significant thing to happen in the US since Bush assumed office. </p> <p>The trouble is that the campaign's message ends with that day also. September 11 has served not as a starting point from which to better understand the world but as an excuse not to understand it at all. It is a reference point that brooks no argument and needs no logic. No weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? \"The next time, the smoking gun could be a mushroom cloud?\" No United Nations authority? \"We will never again wait for permission to defend our country.\" No link between Saddam and al-Qaida? \"They only have to be right once. We have to be right every time.\" </p> <p>This is the real link between Iraq and 9/11 - the rhetorical dissembling that renders victimhood not a point from which they might identify with and connect to the rest of humanity but a means to turn their back on humanity. They portray America's pain as a result of 9/11 not only as unique in its expression but also superior in its intensity. </p> <p>When 3,000 people died on September 11, Le Monde declared: \"We are all Americans now.\" Around 12,000 civilians have died in Iraq since the beginning of the war, yet one waits in vain for anyone to declare that we have all become Iraqis, or Afghans, let alone Palestinians. This is not a competition. Sadly, there are enough victims to go around. Sadder still, if the US continues on its present path, there will be many more. Demanding a monopoly on the right to feel and to inflict pain simply inverts victimhood's regular contradiction - the Bush administration displays material strength and moral weakness. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@gurdian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The French finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, has declared his intention to lead the ruling UMP party. He is also said to have his sights on becoming France's next president <p><b>Why has Mr Sarkozy drawn so much attention?</b> The charismatic finance minister and pretender to the French presidency claimed pole position to succeed Jacques Chirac by standing for the leadership of the governing conservative party [earlier this month]. No one doubts that he will win November's party election and, as head of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), he will control a powerful party machine. This is a vital springboard for any serious presidential candidate.</p> <p>Henry Samuel in the Daily Telegraph, September 6 </p> <p><b>What has been Mr Chirac's response?</b> The president says he will \"give [Mr Sarkozy] his support\" ... but Mr Chirac did not waver from the ruling, which he announced very firmly on July 14, forbidding ministers from becoming leader of the party. Once a minister is \"elected head of the UMP, he must leave his post\", the president warned ... Mr Chirac's supporters hoped that Mr Sarkozy would leave the government immediately ... but the finance minister will stay in his post until the November election.</p> <p>From a report in La Croix, France, September 15 </p> <p><b>Is Mr Chirac right to be wary?</b> On all sides, there are professions of peace ... but no one is really duped ... because the objectives of both men remain so incompatible. The finance minister wants to enter the presidential race in 2007. The president, for his part, wants to wait until the end of his five-year term before deciding whether or not he wants to run for office again. At the very least, he wants to choose his own successor.</p> <p>Carole Barjon in Le Nouvel Observateur, France, September 9 </p> <p> <b> What is their rivalry about? </b> The conflict is not about politics but personality. Petty hatreds and private ambitions are at its root, not differences of beliefs. The course of the country is unlikely to be affected ... Even on the rare occasions when the skirmishes between Mr Chirac and Mr Sarkozy are on policy issues - the referendum on the EU constitution, Turkey's entry into the European Union - the disputes seem limited to which one is more \"in touch\". Principled debate rarely gets a look in. </p> <p>Jonny Thakkar at Spiked Online, September 3 </p> <p> <b> Who is in the stronger position? </b> Mr Chirac is like a boxer cornered in the ring ... The finance minister has achieved the great feat of casting himself as a \"new man\": at the heart of this miracle is the impression that he always speaks the truth and that, thanks to his insatiable dynamism, he is completely in tune with the events of the day. At a stroke, the president of the republic, whose image was of an energetic man undeniably close to his people, now appears remote. </p> <p> Denis Jeambar in L'Express, France, August 23 </p> <p> <b> Will leading the UMP help Mr Sarkozy? </b> The UMP will supply Mr Sarkozy with a useful electoral war chest - parties now get a state subsidy and cannot accept private donations - plus a power base from which to prepare his 2007 presidential bid ... Handily, he will also be able to design the procedure for selecting a presidential candidate for 2007. He intends to reinvigorate the party, clean up its image, and turn it into a sort of think-tank that can refresh the political right. In short, Mr Sarkozy's UMP will be his personal campaign-team-in-waiting. </p> <p> From the Economist, September 11 </p> <p> <b> How relevant is all this to the typical French voter? </b> By evoking this notion of \"political crisis\" too often, one risks neglecting or under- estimating real issues. If the spectacle we have witnessed over the last weeks involving Mr Chirac and Mr Sarkozy ... doesn't induce nausea, it at least denotes the absence of real political debate that deals with people's daily lives and difficulties. </p> <p> Jean-Emmanuel Duco in L'Humanit\u00e9, France, September 16 </p> <p> <b> What will Mr Chirac do next? </b> [He] is gambling that his finance minister ... will drift into oblivion, swallowed up by the tedium of party electioneering. Mr Chirac could then stand for a third presidential term in 2007 or manoeuvre his chosen successor into the post, thus preserving his political legacy. </p> <p> Amelia Gentleman in the Observer, September 5</p>",
  "Roger Taylor carefully tousled his hair before getting astride his trusty bicycle and pedalling furiously to the House of Commons. The papers had held off, thanks to the American president's visit, but his career was certain to end tomorrow, he thought sadly. It wasn't fair. He was basically a decent cove, who was able to riff pointlessly on almost anything for page after page. <p>Eric Onyeama couldn't believe he was making his first appearance in chapter three and that so much space had been given to Roger's aper\u00e7us on middle England. He decided to treat the reader to his own fascinating insights into multicultural London life as he gave the stolen ambulance a parking ticket. </p> <p>The four terrorists were becoming tense in the ambulance after so much time wasted on Roger and Eric's monologues. Now was not the time to hear how Jones learnt his bomb-making skills at the taxpayer's expense at the so-called University of Llangollen, how Haroun was looking forward to his 72 virgins and how Dean was the new Jackal. \"But we'll hear it anyway,\" muttered Jones, as he told everyone to arm their suicide bombs. </p> <p>Cameron, Roger's American intern, was regretting forging the security passes. But she did trust Adam, the only man in Britain who had dared to stand up to her. </p> <p>Adam was feeling guilty that he had lied to Cameron about why he needed the passes. Still, she would understand that a wounded Abu Ghraib prisoner should embarrass the president in front of the world. The French ambassador's girlfriend didn't feel at all guilty about deceiving Adam. </p> <p>The security forces ordered their marksman to take out the four terrorists. Jason Pickel took aim but his sidekick nudged his arm as she had begun to worry about his mental stability after his tour of Iraq. So he missed!!! What larks. </p> <p>Jones ran into the chamber and chained himself to the president. \"We're going to have a global telephone poll to see if America should return the Guantanamo detainees,\" he announced. The director of the BBC decided to set up a premium rate phone line. </p> <p>At first, the voting went against America. Jones dialled the wrong number and blew up Haroun by mistake. How Haroun split his sides! Roger and the French ambassador made impassioned speeches about the free world and everyone rang to say they loved America after all. </p> <p>The prime minister was wondering how he could save his job as Pickel fired a tranquiliser dart. And hit the president!! Jones reached for his gun and Roger wrestled him to the ground. Democracy was saved and, as Roger went home, he reflected that the papers would never dare expose him for investing in a lingerie shop that turned out to be a brothel. What japes. He laughed, not noticing that no one else was joining in. </p> <p><b> The digested read ... digested</b><br> </p> <p> On your bike.</p>",
  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer experienced poor summer trading and is expected to announce terms for its \u00a32.3bn tender offer substantially below the 400p per share that billionaire Philip Green was prepared to pay to take over the ailing retailer two months ago. </p> <p>In a sales update tomorrow, accompanying the tender details, the 300-strong M&amp;S chain is likely to reveal that its sales of womenswear and childrenswear continued to underperform over the summer season. Food sales are also understood to have been poor. </p> <p>The new M&amp;S trading downturn will contrast sharply with the performance of its competitors. Last week, its fashion rival Next unveiled bumper sales and profits while John Lewis pinpointed women's fashion as one of its best-performing departments. </p> <p>The Waitrose supermarket business, part of John Lewis and M&amp;S's chief rival for upmarket food, announced healthy growth in like-for-like sales of more than 3% on last year. Tesco, which unveils first-half results tomorrow, is also expected to put M&amp;S's performance in the shade. </p> <p>The new M&amp;S management will argue that the goods in the stores were the responsibility of the previous management, which was ousted when Mr Green made his bid intentions clear at the end of May. Stuart Rose, the new chief executive, has said it will be a year before his team's influence can been seen in the shops. </p> <p>The details of the tender - equal to nearly 30% of the chain's \u00a38bn stock market capitalisation - will be thrashed out tonight at a meeting of M&amp;S and its advisers at Cazenove, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. Cazenove will process the tender offer. </p> <p>The price range will be announced tomorrow morning but is expected to be about 350p to 380p. M&amp;S shares are changing hands at 350p. The price will depend on investor response, but even at its top end will be markedly short of the price shareholders could have raised had they been able to accept Mr Green's offer. </p> <p>M&amp;S will argue that the price offered is \"not a price for control\" and that shareholders have the option to sell some, all or none of their shares. Long-term investors will benefit from the resultant increase in earnings per share. The tender may also be used by hedge funds that built a stake during the takeover speculation and want a way out. </p> <p>If the M&amp;S offer is spurned, the store will still press ahead with the return of capital, one of the planks of the M&amp;S defence strategy along with a renewed focus on older shoppers and the disposal of the M&amp;S credit card business. </p> <p>In that case it will either wade into the market to buy the shares, pay a special dividend or issue B shares. The preferred route, which M&amp;S has taken before, would probably be to issue B shares.</p>",

  "No, Sheldon Archer, the illegality of the war in Iraq does not mean that Bush and Blair should be up there with Saddam (Letters, September 18). They should be up there on their own, together with any Iraqis who aided them.

  "In your article on the sentencing of men involved in a paedophile ring (Grooming ring got off lightly, says judge, September 17), the concerns that the judge is reported to have raised have been addressed in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force on May 1. The act contains new offences on the abuse of children through prostitution and new offences on the sexual abuse of children and grooming.

  "The issue is no longer foxhunting. From now on the argument is about the rule of law. I make no secret of my belief that a civilised society should not allow an amusement which has as its object - or at least its known consequence - the death of an animal. If the right to hunt foxes is a question of civil liberties, so is the right to organise bear-baiting and cockfights. But the debate on that subject is about to be concluded - at least in parliament. No doubt, it will go on in the country. That is the way that free societies behave. Foxhunters will, entirely legitimately, attempt to persuade the House of Commons to change its mind. Today's question concerns how they react to the decision when and while it has the force of law. <p>There are several precedents to guide their conduct. I spent years of my life telling trade unions that there were no such things as \"Tory laws\". Most of the foxhunting fraternity took the same view. Those of us who told Arthur Scargill to respect the will of a democratically elected parliament are entitled to say the same to the masters of assorted hunts. Indeed, we are entitled to ask what so many people asked us when we were part of what was laughingly called the Labour party leadership. Are persons of influence and authority going to set an example by condemning their lawless associates? </p> <p>That is a question the Prince of Wales now needs to answer. Rumours that he will go on hunting, even when it is illegal, are clearly absurd. A prince who knowingly defied the law could not become king. But last week's events still cause him a problem. The upper-class hooligans who invaded the House of Commons are associated with him in the public mind. The newspapers published photographs of them grinning together, and he is a well-known supporter of the cause which prompted their \"invasion\" of the Commons. </p> <p>While it was still a legal activity, no one could reasonably feel more than distaste for his hunting enthusiasm. Now that it is about to become illegal, he has a duty to tell the more excitable devotees of the chase that they are no more above the law than the miners were. He ought already to have condemned the Hooray Henrys who disrupted the Commons. The Act of Settlement requires him to protect parliament. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt and put his silence down to slow reaction time. If he remains silent when the promised lawlessness begins, it will be generally assumed that he supports the motorway blockades and the trashing of MPs' constituency offices. </p> <p>No doubt, apologists for the monarchy will say that he should not be dragged into politics. Right, but too late. Thanks to his hooligan associates, he is already part of the political debate. To preserve his constitutional integrity he needs to say that, emotional huntsman though he remains, he accepts the will of parliament and expects all of his putative subjects to do the same. If Charles III makes the same mistake as Charles I, his defiance of parliament will have less spectacular consequences. But its long-term effect on the future of the monarchy might be more damaging. </p> <p>People who pay parking fines and get caught on speed cameras are likely to be impatient with the notion that foxhunters are a special legal case. That is the cry of every petty criminal who is caught. The Prince of Wales will not increase his popularity by tacitly subscribing to the view that their cause justifies a privileged position which would be denied to the men and women protesting against an unjust war and was denied to men at Cortonwood colliery who demonstrated against the decision to destroy their livelihoods. </p> <p>All the emotive arguments in favour of foxhunting could have been applied to mining 20 years ago, with 10 times more force. Jobs were lost. A way of life was sacrificed. A noble part of our history died. The newspapers which are treating the Commons invaders like heroes need to show a little consistency. And the heir to the throne ought to create a few headlines by speaking up for the law. </p> <p>Neither the Prince of Wales nor the Countryside Alliance can hide behind the demeaning excuse that the hooligans are an unwanted addition the peaceful protests. Grown-ups have to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. We know, as a result of last week's events, that a lawless fringe - blocking roads and throwing flash bombs at police horses - will always hang round the pro-hunt demonstrations, initially peaceful or not. Someone the hunters will listen to has to demand that the law be respected. The Prince of Wales is the ideal candidate for the job - unless he is a secret sympathiser with the people who hold democracy in contempt.</p>",
  "The coincidence of timing is both hapless and brutal. One moment, a few Old Etonian oiks set the mother of parliaments soiling her knickers, and much hysterical quavering about democracy under threat follows (Oh calamity! Suppose they'd been terrorists rather than Telegraph-reading toffs). And the next, here comes Ayad Allawi, prime minister of an Iraq that must somehow turn democratic by next January - but, for the interim, keeps seeing its people killed in their hundreds each week. <p>Can our leaders and jittery backbenchers offer Allawi the homeland security he desperately needs? No: that's beyond the Tony Blair he met yesterday or the (allegedly) most powerful man in the world he will fly on to meet. </p> <p>Sure enough, Messrs Blair and Bush can mouth the rolling phrases of welcome. \"You are the very crucible of the fight against terrorism,\" according to Blair. Britain can send a few more troops to guard polling stations, if required, as well as pull them out on the quiet. America can swap rebuilding cash for security cash. But there is nothing they can do except make vague promises, grin and yack. </p> <p>They can't stop the car bombs or the carnage among Allawi's fledgling police. They can't stop their own troops being killed as their own elections near. They can't stop the hostage-takers who so sicken western public opinion, and who then play on that revulsion with masterly malevolence. They can't keep the oil pipelines safe (or world prices under control). </p> <p>They can, in fact, only mouth pieties as they clasp their chosen man's hand for the cameras and pretend that one fine day (just after America votes, since you ask) it will all come right. Bring our boys home. Revolutionise the Middle East. Lay al-Qaida waste. Heaven bless the miracle of the ballot box. But meanwhile, hear the chirrups from Peter Hain and friends: can we please have the Met and M15 to keep our shivering talking shop safe? </p> <p>It is all, calmly considered, beyond pathetic. It exhorts bravery and sacrifice from those who have seen tens of thousands of their fellow citizens die in the past 12 months. It pretends that an election or two will bring magical peace and freedom. Yet there is no sign of that at a querulous Westminster, nor in the US, where the president travels with a security detail big enough to swamp Baghdad on a bad day. </p> <p>Freedom, it seems, is to be won by the blood of others. Freedom is our single transferable gift to them, our shield against darkness. But meanwhile, Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and umpteen steely sonatas from John Ashcroft and David Blunkett, is our gift to ourselves. </p> <p>Freedom, though, is also the freedom to ask awkward questions, to inquire of our masters: please, what happens next? And here the rhetoric fades to a mumble. </p> <p>Allawi, good foot soldier that he is, declares that the insurgents are losing steam, that he's winning his own war for survival. Kofi Annan, good honest diplomat that he is, says that feels like wishful thinking and January elections look an impossible dream. Yet Blair and George Bush, twin towers of tautology, say nothing useful. </p> <p>Our PM still talks of Iraq as a \"stable democratic country\" in waiting, but not of how it gets from A to B. The president of the United States, with 140,000 troops on the ground who want to come home, talks about something else. His official campaign website (the one that swing voters can turn to) solves the problem by barely mentioning it. </p> <p>\"Fifty million people have been liberated from despotic, totalitarian regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq,\" it says. \"The brutal regime of Saddam Hussein is gone, and an interim regime is leading the Iraqi people to freedom.\" And that's it, period. Re-elect Bush and Cheney and what do you get? A blank page. </p> <p>Try Kerry and Edwards on the big issue, then? Forget that, too. Let's \"plan Iraq's future by working with our allies\", they say. Let's \"launch a massive and accelerated training effort to build Iraqi security\". Let's get our boys home by 2008, employing a plan too secret to describe in even vestigial detail. </p> <p>But there's a terrible mis-match here. We ask the Iraqis to suffer and endure in a cause we hold dear, yet we tell neither them nor our own voters the truth. We hail democracy as some wonder ingredient, yet close the packet closer to home. </p> <p>Ayad Allawi is a brave man; he wouldn't be where he is if he wasn't. Iraq, after Saddam, is full of brave men and women. But that same Iraq - its social infrastructure dismantled or destroyed - is desperately vulnerable. Why do the bombs keepgoing off? Because enough of society shields the bombers? How can so few dissidents cause such mayhem? Because there are actually rather a lot of them, because they are strong and Allawi is weak, already discredited in too many eyes by the way that, perforce, he must lean on America? Those pictures with Bush this week will say two different things: to Americans, that an Iraqi leader is handling this crisis - and, to Iraqis, that Allawi is a Bush puppet. </p> <p>It's a hopeless two-way stretch. It pretends the nightmare of Iraq is almost over, when it may just be beginning. It does not tell America's voters that this is the longest and bloodiest of hauls, with no release date and no exit strategy. </p> <p>Democracy? Northern Ireland doesn't want it, again: too many sacrifices from too many politicians. (Wait till Moqtada al-Sadr sings that tune.) Westminster shuts its doors and rolls concrete blocks into place. Blair moves on, lest memos from the past pursue him. But let us, at least, be honest to our good, free selves. Here is a problem without a solution. And, inescapably in a democracy, it is our problem. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@gurdian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The European commission has given Germany until the end of next month to scrap a 1960 law protecting Volkswagen from a hostile takeover and renewed its threat to take legal action. </p> <p>It is understood that Frits Bolkestein, the outgoing internal market commissioner, is determined to clear up the battle over the \"Volkswagen law\" before he quits office. </p> <p>The prospect of legal action is the latest threat to VW, which this week was forced to call off plans to give Abu Dhabi a 9.8% stake in the group to finance the \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.3bn) purchase of a 50% share in a Dutch car leasing company. </p> <p>It comes as VW is in negotiations with the IG Metall union over plans for a two-year wage freeze and a 30% cut in labour costs. </p> <p>Brussels views the VW law as an infringement of treaty rules guaranteeing free movement of capital. It is drawing on a court ruling in May 2003 that the British government's \"golden share\" in airports group BAA - which limited voting rights of a shareholder to 15% - similarly breached Treaty of Rome rules. </p> <p>In VW's case it argues that investors in other EU countries are disadvantaged because the law gives the federal German state and Lower Saxony, the carmaker's home state, a blocking 20% minority vote. A majority of more than 80% is needed for important supervisory board decisions. </p> <p>The commission argues that this, plus a provision capping at 20% any shareholder's voting rights, is a derogation from German company law and liable to prevent other investors buying shares and, eventually, mounting a bid for the group. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der, as Lower Saxony premier, used to sit on the supervisory board and Peter Hartz - the VW personnel chief fighting to implement the cost-cutting plan - is the architect of Mr Schr\u00f6der's controversial labour reforms. </p> <p>Berlin has expressed \"incomprehension\" at Mr Bolkestein's threats, while Lower Saxony has accused the commissioner of being unable to show how the board and shareholding structure break the rules regarding free movement of capital.</p>",

  "<p>The first criminal trial involving former executives of the now infamous energy company, Enron, begins today in a case that could have a crucial bearing on future trials of the company's top officials.</p> <p>None of the six defendants - four former Merrill Lynch executives and two former mid-level Enron executives who are charged with conspiracy and fraud - have the notoriety of Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay, or former chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling. </p> <p>Nonetheless, the case starting today in Houston will be closely watched as a possible harbinger for when Mr Lay and Mr Skilling themselves appear in the dock. At issue in the so-called Nigerian barge trial, as jury selection begins, is whether Enron's financial machinations - the kind that led to its eventual collapse - went beyond the law. </p> <p>Enron's bankruptcy in 2001 was the first of several high-profile scandals that sent tremors through Wall Street and the US corporate world and its impact is still being felt.</p> <p>\"It's significant because this calls into question Wall Street practices in dealing with corporate America,\" Philip Hilder, a former federal prosecutor who represents several Enron-related clients in Houston, told the Associated Press. \"The ramifications of this are broader than Enron, certainly.\" </p> <p>Prosecutors accuse the six of helping push through a sale of several floating power plants stationed along the Nigerian coast to the brokerage Merrill Lynch in late 1999 that allowed Enron to report about $12m (\u00a36.7m) in pre-tax earnings. All six have pleaded innocent.</p> <p>The defendants are: Daniel Bayly, the former chairman of investment banking for Merrill; Robert Furst, the former Enron relationship manager for Merrill; James Brown, former head of Merrill's asset lease and finance group; William Fuhs, former Merrill vice-president who answered to Mr Brown; Dan Boyle, a former finance executive on former Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow's staff; and Sheila Kahanek, a former in-house Enron accountant. </p> <p>Merrill avoided prosecution a year ago by cooperating with the government and implementing reforms that prohibit questionable deals. Six months earlier, Merrill paid the securities and exchange commission (SEC), the US financial watchdog, $80m to settle civil allegations involving the barge deal without admitting or denying wrongdoing. </p> <p>The barge transaction took place in the last days of December 1999, when Enron was struggling to sell the investment in the barges in time to be included in the quarter's profit figures. Merrill agreed to invest $7m in a financial entity that made the purchase, based on an assurance that it would get back its investment, plus a profit, in six months.</p> <p>At issue is whether Enron itself, as the seller, was guaranteeing Merrill against loss. If so, Merrill was never at any risk as any future loss would have to be repaid by Enron. Prosecutors will argue, therefore, that it was a sham sale, designed to inflate Enron's profits.</p> <p>Enron's collapse, followed by several corporate scandals, prompted Congress to pass sweeping legislation. The Sarbanes-Oxley law was designed to improve corporate governance, but companies are now complaining of over-regulation.</p> <p>William Donaldson, the chairman of the SEC, has hit back, arguing that top executives have failed to provide \"ethical\" leadership. Mr Donaldson has pointed to the lack of progress in linking pay more closely to performance as evidence that such leadership was wanting.</p>",
  "The Liberal Democrats will fight David Blunkett's proposals to ban civil servants from membership of the far-right British National party (BNP), the party announced today. <p>Revealing the move at a Guardian fringe meeting at the party conference in Bournemouth, shadow home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten won a round of applause for denouncing the move as \"a step down a very, very dangerous path\".</p> <p>He warned that a future home secretary could expand on the legislation to start banning membership of any party the government of the time disagreed with.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett floated the idea earlier this year of making membership of the openly-racist party grounds for dismissal from the public sector, and several unions have already won legal battles to expel members who also belong to the party.</p> <p>Today, speaking at the Liberty or Equality debate hosted by the Guardian, he said: \"I am not prepared to have legislation banning BNP membership in place.</p> <p>\"If an individual starts expressing racist or offensive views, then there are laws already in place to deal with that.\"</p> <p>Officials made it clear the policy position had only been decided last night and Mr Oaten spoke ahead of his fellow Lib Dem panellists - Sir Menzies Campbell, Nick Clegg and Sarah Teather - as they had yet to be briefed on the subject.</p> <p>Other topical issues got the panel debating the grey areas of liberalism, such as the contradictions in banning foxhunting and smoking in public places.</p> <p>Both Sir Menzies and Mr Oaten refused to vote for last week's bill outlawing hunting with hounds, saying it offended their basic libertarian outlook.</p> <p>Mr Oaten told an audience of around 300 delegates that \"you can't pick and choose your liberalism\", with the debate over taxing or banning 4x4s from town centres also exposing contradictions in the party's core philosophy.</p> <p>Ms Teather, the party's victor in last year's Brent East byelection, suggested a compromise of \"licensed smoking bars\" if a public ban on smoking comes into force, while Sir Menzies, fresh from his barnstorming conference speech on foreign policy, suggested introducing a \"civil liberties audit\" against which all future incursions on citizens' rights be measured.</p> <p>He said: \"Civil liberties were fought over, not handed down by an over-mighty executive or kings.\"</p> <p>Mr Oaten quoted the late philosopher Isaiah Berlin as summing up the party's dilemma over the battle between liberty and equality, saying: \"Freedom for the wolves means death for the sheep\". </p> <p>All four panellists ended up choosing liberty over equality</p>",

  "First let me say it has been a great privilege to lead the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords for the last three years. I have had wonderful colleagues. Liberal Democrat Peers work incredibly hard. They know what they are talking about. They dominate question times and debates by the sheer quality of their contributions. <p>On a wide range of Home Office bills, they have championed trial by jury, civil liberties, decent treatment of asylum seekers, improving prison conditions, and effective action against racial and gender discrimination. They have fought for a more democratic House of Lords and have rejected half-baked reforms. They have presented a powerful case against the illegal invasion of Iraq, and the subsequent failure to respect in some instances the lives and liberties of Iraq's civilians. They have fought against tuition fees, argued for better pensions, massively improved bills on housing, planning and regional government. I am incredibly proud of them; and their achievements deserve far more publicity than they have got.</p> <p>So, the cat is now out of the bag. The suspicion that we as Liberal Democrats were troubled by from February of last year, that the Iraq war was illegal, has now been confirmed by the Secretary-General of the UN Kofi Annan himself.</p> <p>It is no use Patricia Hewitt in her most dulcet tones saying that she disagrees with Mr. Annan. She is a Minister in a Government deeply implicated in the invasion of Iraq. He is the most senior official of the world organization, a man of wisdom and caution, widely respected by the international community. Whose judgement is the rest of the world likely to respect?</p> <p>The Government wants to move on from Iraq. It does not want to dwell on failure. So much so that the Prime Minister is willing to talk to the T.U.C.!</p> <p>He claims he's back to \"issues concerning hard-working families\". </p> <p>But we cannot move on so easily. This war in Iraq is our war, committed in all our names. Hard-working families across the country are implicated by the decisions made on their behalf. In the name of the United Nations, the rule of law, the battle against terrorism, Britain invaded Iraq.</p> <p>Twelve hundred brave servicemen and women, and between twelve and fifteen thousand Iraqi civilians, including babies and children, are now dead.</p> <p>Today Iraq is lawless and slipping into chaos. Foreign contractors, like foreign soldiers, are immune from Iraqi law. Senator Chuck Hagel, a leading Republican, last week described the dearth of proper spending on reconstruction as \"beyond pitiful\". And experts agree that the terrorist menace has grown, not declined, and that terrorist groups now operate freely in Iraq, where previously there had been no link.</p> <p>The Government cannot move on until it admits to this - the greatest diplomatic blunder since Suez - and learns lessons from it. One of those lessons is how weak Britain's influence has been over the American administration. Even the Road Map for Israel and Palestine, so strongly urged by the Prime Minister, is now a sour joke. The settlements go on growing, the building of the Wall in Palestinian territory goes unchallenged by the American Government. </p> <p>Meanwhile, we have taken our eye off the ball on terrorism. The CIA has fewer experienced staff working on Osama bin Laden than in September 2001! We neglected the War on Terror for a War on Iraq - a war of our choosing. The consequences of that choice are emerging every day.</p> <p>At home, Liberal Democrats have developed flagship policies that confront some of the deepest problems in our society. For the millions of elderly men and women who have not shared in the country's growing prosperity, the package of Liberal Democrat proposals offers the elderly, and women in particular, a just and fair new deal: much more generous pensions for those 75 and older, free personal health care, and local income tax replacing council tax. </p> <p>Pensioners could be more than \u00a32,000 better off each year. The elderly are not the only losers in our society. The rich are becoming much richer, the poor are standing still. Over the last 10 years, the remuneration of directors rose by 288% - and that of ordinary employees on average only 45%. Many of our fellow citizens are being priced out of the housing market, or live far from work and are then penalized by the cost of public transport - wildly more expensive than in other European countries.</p> <p>Against this background, it is right to ask the best off in our country to contribute a little more in tax, so that less well-off people can send their children to University, and ensure proper care for their older relatives. The 'Orange Book' has been greeted by commentators as a restatement of Liberal democrat belief in the free market. I have no problem with markets once we remember they are embedded in the political and legal system of any society.</p> <p>In the USA, healthcare is seen as a market. A free market, without the values and constraints of the rule of law and a belief in the value of each individual human life, can become a jungle in which power replaces law. I know - I saw what a free market without independent courts and democratic accountability did to Russia in the 1990s, consigning millions to extreme poverty and making a few unbelievably rich.</p> <p>So Liberal Democrats must always bear in mind our commitment to social justice, rooted in the radicalism of a Lloyd George and the practical compassion of a William Beveridge.</p> <p>Finally, we are faced with hugely difficult judgements on the balance between security and individual liberty in an age of terrorism. It is all too easy to destroy democracy in the name of security, as both Guantanamo Bay and the recent announcement by President Putin of Russia, to abolish elections for regional governors and bar independents from standing for the Duma, have shown. How have the British government responded? They have postponed publication of the Foreign Office's Human Rights report, because this is a 'sensitive time'.</p> <p>I am proud of the way Liberal Democrats have insisted that liberties should never be sacrificed unless it is absolutely imperative to do so. Difficult and delicate judgements on these matters will have to be made in the new Parliament, and will affect our democracy for years to come.</p> <p>I would feel happier about the robustness of our democracy if the Blair Government took its accountability to Parliament and the people more seriously. The Hutton and Butler reports showed that many crucial decisions are made in private bilateral meetings, that no minutes are kept, and that the Cabinet is often bypassed.</p> <p>In the Butler report's words, the Government's procedures have taken on an informal and circumscribed character. In layman's terms, that is 'sofa government'.</p> <p>Governments must be held to account. If they are not, democracy itself fades away. </p> <p>Let me end by congratulating our outstanding Liberal Democrat parliamentary and council candidates, and the legions of Liberal democrat activists who support them, for the amazing results of the last few years.</p> <p>We have broken through against both the Conservatives and Labour, and in my view it is important to see both of the old parties, not just one, as our political target.</p> <p>The mould may not yet be broken, but the crack is dramatically widening.</p>",
  "Murderers who plead guilty could see their prison sentences reduced by a third under new guidelines published today. <p>The Sentencing Guidelines Council - an independent body chaired by the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf - has drawn up a sliding scale for judges to take into account when sentencing defendants.</p> <p>It says a reduction of a third should be given to those pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity, a quarter to those who plead once a trial date has been set, and a tenth to defendants who confess after their trials have begun.</p> <p>The SGC said the reductions were appropriate because a guilty plea would remove the need for a trial, saving money and sparing both victims and witnesses the distress of having to come to court and give evidence.</p> <p>It added that, in \"exceptional cases\", offenders could even get more than a third taken off their sentence if they demonstrated \"absolute candour\".</p> <p>The idea of reducing a prison sentence following a timely guilty plea is not new in English law. However, until now, judges have not been obliged to take a plea into account when setting a sentence following a conviction for murder. </p> <p>Mandatory life sentences for murder are widely seen as the main reason why so few murder charges result in a guilty plea.</p> <p>Lord Woolf accepted that the draft guidelines would \"almost certainly\" allow a one third reduction on the current 15-year standard tariff for murder. </p> <p>In some cases, murderers could serve substantially less than ten years in prison, but England and Wales' most senior judge said the guidelines were formalising arrangements that had been in place for many years.</p> <p>\"Someone who would get 15 years would now get 10 years,\" he said. \"I have been involved in the criminal justice system for something close to 50 years and, throughout those 50 years, if a person gave a plea of guilty it was understood that there would be a reduction in the sentence.</p> <p>\"The tradition used to be in murder cases that you always contest it. There's no reason why that should apply. Today's draft guidelines encourage those who commit even the offence of murder to take responsibility.\"</p> <p>His comments appeared to contradict those of an SGC spokesman, who yesterday said it would have to be an exceptional case for a murderer to receive any reduction on their sentence, \"let alone the full one third reduction\".</p> <p>However, the lord chief justice insisted that murderers would still only be released once a parole board was satisfied that they were no longer a danger. </p> <p>Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, violent and sexual offenders can receive a new indeterminate sentence keeping them imprisoned at the end of their tariff if still considered dangerous.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, criticised the new proposals. \"What kind of message will this send? Just seven years for murder is not a serious deterrent,\" he said. \"This would be a severe blow for friends and relatives of the murder victims, and a discouragement to those who enforce law and order.</p> <p>\"Parliament should set the sentencing guidelines,\" Mr Davis told <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/news/article.cfm?obj_id=115728\">Conservatives.com</a>. \"[Home secretary] David Blunkett cannot claim to be tough on crime if he will allow murderers to walk free after just seven years. With over 800 murders a year, up by a sixth in only five years, this reinforces the need for punishments that deter killers.\" </p> <p>Further SGC guidelines published today advise judges on a range of new community sentences which will come into effect next year. They will look at the use of intermittent custody - sometimes described as \"weekend jail\". </p> <p>Lord Woolf said he believed custody was currently used too often. \"What we earnestly hope, as a result of these proposals, is that we will use custody more effectively and more appropriately than we do now,\" he added. \"If this works, we will not need as many new prisons as we think we need at present.\"</p>",
  "Freedom, fairness, and trust are values which must apply to our conduct abroad as much as to our policy at home. <p>Once, Britain was seen as a force for freedom and fairness in the world. </p> <p>Trusted to do the right thing in international affairs and known to be supportive of international institutions. </p> <p>Regarded as champions of human rights in Burma, Zimbabwe and the Middle East. </p> <p>Advocates of debt relief and supporters of development assistance. </p> <p>Respected as a country prepared to intervene to safeguard lives and protect the innocent in Kosovo and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>But these foreign policy achievements have been undermined, discounted and devalued. </p> <p>Our reputation and respect have been diluted and dissipated, and all because of Iraq.</p> <p>Never mind our record on Kosovo or Sierra Leone or overseas aid. </p> <p>Around the world Britain is associated with unilateralism in Iraq and double standards in the Middle East.</p> <p>We are regarded as complicit in human rights violations committed in the misnamed \"war on terror\" in Russia, in Indonesia, in Guant\u00e1namo, and, yes, even in Belmarsh.</p> <p>Trust in the prime minister has fallen at home. </p> <p>Trust in Britain has fallen abroad.</p> <p>Terrorism is an evil that must be confronted. </p> <p>But behaving ourselves with principle in international affairs is a necessary part of a robust response to terrorism. </p> <p>Defending human rights helps to defuse terrorism. </p> <p>Abuses such as those at Guant\u00e1namo or Abu Ghraib provoke it. </p> <p>The government wants to move on from Iraq but the inadequate intelligence and the illegality upon which military action was taken cannot easily be brushed aside.</p> <p>Now we know that 12 months ahead of military action right at the heart of government it was accepted that regime change was illegal.</p> <p>Now we know from the classified documents obtained by the Daily Telegraph that regime change was always the objective.</p> <p>Now we know that disarmament and weapons of mass destruction were a blind designed to hide the true objective of regime change.</p> <p>Now we know why the government has resisted so stoutly any inquiry with the remit to scrutinise political actions of ministers and the advice of officials. </p> <p>Now we know that in the Foreign Office there was apprehension and anxiety about the consequences of the removal of Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>We know all these things now. </p> <p>But the British public did not know them when it took to the streets in protest. </p> <p>And the House of Commons did not know them when it voted to endorse military action in March 2003.</p> <p>But public and politicians should have known. </p> <p>We were entitled to know.</p> <p>Let me say a word about the Conservatives.</p> <p>I promise I shall be brief.</p> <p>Their conversion from cheer-leaders to critics betrays a sleight of hand which even Mr Paul Daniels would admire. </p> <p>They are the Wobblers of Westminster. </p> <p>And so the government took us to war.</p> <p>We went to war on a threat and a promise. </p> <p>The threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction and the promise of progress in the Middle East. </p> <p>But neither threat nor promise has been fulfilled.</p> <p>No Weapons of Mass Destruction have been found. </p> <p>The Middle East Road Map has been rolled up. </p> <p>Unilateral action by Mr. Sharon has passed without comment by the UK and approved by the US. </p> <p>Mr Sharon can threaten the assassination of Yasser Arafat and no voice is raised in protest.</p> <p>A just settlement seems further away than ever. </p> <p>Does anyone here believe that the security and universal recognition to which Israel is entitled legally and morally, will be achieved by the degradation of the Palestinians. </p> <p>Nothing but nothing justifies suicide bombing - the life of every Israeli child is of equal value and as precious in the sight of God as that of every Palestinian child.</p> <p>And neither will every live in safety or security until there is peace.</p> <p>The awful truth is that no one loves the Palestinians or fears them enough to want to make progress.</p> <p>The coalition has been stained by the debauchery of Abu Ghraib and British citizens languish in Guant\u00e1namo, shorn of legal rights and denied justice. </p> <p>Our influence is diminished and our reputation sullied.</p> <p>Before the war, it was claimed that to attack Iraq was necessary because it was a threat. </p> <p>Now we are told the war was justified because Saddam was a tyrant. </p> <p>A justification of doubtful legality has been replaced by one of no legality whatsoever.</p> <p>The British people look in vain for contrition from their government.</p> <p>They wait in vain for an apology from their prime minister.</p> <p>They see deadly attack after attack in Iraq.</p> <p>They see inadequate and under-trained Iraqi security forces and police.</p> <p>They see a crisis of expectation as promises of economic improvement remain unfulfilled.</p> <p>They see the results of the negligent failure to make proper plans or provision for post-conflict Iraq.</p> <p>They see many towns and cities across Iraq where the insurgents rule, where neither the coalition nor the fledgling Iraqi administration can claim effective authority. </p> <p>They see a country where security is so fragile that the secretary general of the United Nations doubts if the essential elections can be held.</p> <p>They see a country where dismemberment along religious and ethnic lines cannot be excluded, the consequence of which would be instability throughout the whole region of the Middle East.</p> <p>And for all this our country has a moral responsibility,</p> <p>A moral responsibility imposed on all of us by our government.</p> <p>A moral responsibility so acute that we have no option but to stay,</p> <p>No option but to deploy 8,000 British troops, and perhaps even more if the safety of those who are already there becomes compromised or to meet our responsibilities to the United Nations.</p> <p>If more British troops are necessary they should be deployed on condition that they remain in the British sector and under British operational command.</p> <p>No option but to expose these troops to risk.</p> <p>No option but to commit resources which could be spent elsewhere.</p> <p>And all this on a flawed prospectus exposed by the evidence presented at the Hutton enquiry and the conclusions reached by Lord Butler.</p> <p>And all this justified by the prime minister with the assertion \"because it is the right thing to do\".</p> <p>But no obligation of this kind can be open-ended and without limit of time.</p> <p>And so today I say that British forces should plan for a phased withdrawal as soon as a democratically elected government is in office.</p> <p>By our continuing recognition of our responsibilities we have given the people of Iraq an opportunity. </p> <p>But they must take it. We cannot take it for them.</p> <p>And so in the continuing aftermath of Iraq Britain is a nation in search of a coherent foreign policy. </p> <p>We cannot base our foreign policy on the instincts of the prime minister, however well intentioned.</p> <p>Evangelism sits uneasily in the world of relative values which is foreign policy.</p> <p>Iraq is a symptom of a foreign policy based on personality rather than principle. </p> <p>Britain needs to decide where it stands on Europe. </p> <p>A referendum campaign will be a test and an opportunity. </p> <p>Alongside the government we shall argue for an affirmative vote, but we are entitled to expect the government to raise its game and to put the case with more passion and commitment than we have seen so far.</p> <p>We have seen little commitment during 8 years of delay over the euro and a short sighted lack of regard for our allies over Iraq.</p> <p>Our party, a party of reform at Westminster, should be a party of reform in Brussels too.</p> <p>Nick Clegg is right when he argues for institutional stability, an end to the permanent cultural revolution in Europe. </p> <p>When he argues for greater democratic accountability and for the rigorous application of the principle subsidiarity, so that Brussels only acts where a collective approach will serve our interests best. </p> <p>And our party of all parties should be receptive to new members of the EU so long as they meet the economic criteria and respect the rule of law and human rights.</p> <p>Britain needs to decide where it stands on the UN. </p> <p>Are we to continue to pick and choose between UN resolutions, using some as ambiguous mandates to invade while ignoring others that have been flouted for years? </p> <p>Britain should be in favour of reform of the UN. </p> <p>The permanent membership of the security council should be expanded to take account of the political realities of 2005 and not 1945. </p> <p>There should be a right of intervention where it is necessary to stem large scale loss of life and to provide urgent protection against brutality and ethnic cleansing. </p> <p>But such a right must be in accordance with recognised and agreed principles and consistent with evolving international law.</p> <p>And couldn't we just do with such a right when Colin Powell identifies what is happening in Darfur as genocide?</p> <p>Britain needs to decide where it stands in relation to the United States. </p> <p>We cannot conduct our foreign policy on the flawed precept of \"my ally right or wrong\".</p> <p>This is not an excuse to adopt the old unthinking visceral anti-Americanism of the left. </p> <p>New Labour now seeks rightly to protect Grosvenor Square, but some of us remember when they wanted to storm it. </p> <p>We shall be a better ally if we exercise critical judgement and independent thought.</p> <p>On Iraq, unswerving public support in return for the hope of private influence proved a Faustian bargain.</p> <p>On the Palestinians, on steel, on agriculture, on Kyoto, on the ICC, on Guant\u00e1namo, what has Britain gained? </p> <p>By contrast, what have been the political and diplomatic costs of our symbiotic relationship in relation to Iraq?</p> <p>At present, Britain's foreign policy lacks coherence.</p> <p>It is at the mercy of the prevailing wind in international affairs. </p> <p>And the prevailing wind inevitably blows from the west ... from Washington and is likely to do so for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>I do not believe that change in administration in the United States would bring about material change in American foreign policy. </p> <p>A Kerry administration would have little room to manoeuvre, particularly if the Republicans were in the majority in the Senate and the House. </p> <p>Any change at least in the beginning would be of style rather than substance. </p> <p>The challenge for Britain and Europe is to live with an enormously powerful neighbour to whom we are bound by a history of shared values and common interests.</p> <p>We still share values with the United States, we still share interests. </p> <p>But there are areas where we differ. </p> <p>And when we differ, Britain will be better served by a recognition of those differences. </p> <p>Our relationship with the United States should be a partnership of influence and should not be so subordinate that we appear to be subservient.</p> <p>The principles of freedom, fairness and trust should have practical application. </p> <p>I firmly believe Britain should be candid about human rights abuses wherever they occur. </p> <p>A policy of engagement does not mean we have to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses. </p> <p>Why? Because it is the right thing to do.</p> <p>We should not sell arms to governments that abuse human rights or punish legitimate internal dissent. </p> <p>Why? Because it is the right thing to do.</p> <p>Britain should be a model European country, promoting justice and diversity across the continent.</p> <p>Why? Because it is the right thing to do.</p> <p>Britain should take a lead in bringing renewed urgency to the Middle East peace process. </p> <p>Why? Because it is the right thing to do.</p> <p>I am angry, not because I was deceived over Iraq, but because we were right. </p> <p>I am angry for the young men and women of our armed forces who face daily danger.</p> <p>I am angry for the innocent, unnumbered and uncounted Iraqi civilians who have perished.</p> <p>Angry for a House of Commons that was persauded to support military action on a flawed prospectus.</p> <p>Any if you should feel angry you are entitled to be so. </p> <p>And if the British people should feel angry, they too have every right.</p> <p>Every right to be angry that freedom, fairness and trust are absent from British foreign policy. </p> <p>It is our task to ensure that every action of this government is measured against these principles.</p> <p>I promise you we shall hold them to account.</p>",
  "The president of China, Hu Jintao, squeezed his predecessor and main rival Jiang Zemin out of the top military post yesterday, easing the way for a new generation of leaders to stamp their image on the world's most populous country. <p>After months of speculation about a power struggle at the top of the Communist party, the state media announced that Mr Jiang had stepped down as chairman of the central military commission. </p> <p>The 78-year-old, who rose to his position in the aftermath of the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, had three years of his term to run, but a statement issued by the party central committee made it clear that a divided leadership was not in the interests of the country. </p> <p>\"The plenum unanimously agreed that the change is conducive to upholding the fundamental principle and system of the party's absolute leadership over the military,\" the communique issued at the end of the four-day annual meeting of senior party officials said. </p> <p>His replacement as commander in chief will be Mr Hu, who is now unrivalled as the head of the state, party and military - the three most powerful positions in the country. </p> <p>But at least four of the nine members of the politburo, including the propaganda chief, are considered proteges of Mr Jiang. The senior ranks of the armed forces are also packed with generals promoted by the outgoing chief. </p> <p>Mr Jiang has yet to say why he stepped down. In recent weeks there have been reports that he is suffering from a heart condition and, possibly, cancer. </p> <p>Several academics have said that he may be following the example set by China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who gave up his military post two years after resigning from the politburo. </p> <p>Mr Jiang's legacy was assured this year when his concept of the \"Three Represents\" - which encouraged capitalists to join the Communist party - was written into the constitution alongside Mao Zedong's Thought and Deng Xiaoping's Theory. </p> <p>To smooth the most peaceful transition of power in modern Chinese history the plenum commended Mr Jiang's \"outstanding contributions to the party, the state and the people\". </p> <p>Political analysts and diplomatic sources said they did not expect any sudden change of policy, but there is a high public expectation that the consolidation of power will allow the leadership to be bolder in pursuing greater social equality, gradual democratic reform and improved relations with Hong Kong. </p> <p>Despite the party's monolithic image, senior communist sources say control has swung from the right to the left in the past two years. </p> <p>Mr Jiang, a proponent of free-market economics, tight media control and a nationalistic hard line on Taiwan, was in the former camp. </p> <p>Mr Hu and his prime minister, Wen Jiabao, are associated with a policy of \"balanced development\" aimed at centralising power to tackle the glaring inequalities between the urban rich and the rural poor. </p> <p>They were praised for their handling of the Sars crisis last year, when the media was given unprecedented freedom to expose official cover-ups. </p> <p>Advocates of political reform say Mr Hu and Mr Wen have greater democratic instincts than their predecessors. </p> <p>In Hong Kong and Taiwan, politicians and academics believe Mr Hu will take a less confrontational stance than his predecessor. </p> <p>Yesterday the plenum also strengthened the country's ability to use force to prevent Taiwan from proclaiming independence, and added three to the membership of the military commission, representatives of the navy, air force and artillery corps. </p>",
  "<p>More than a third of the waste paper and plastic collected by British local authorities, supermarkets and businesses for recycling is being sent 8,000 miles to China without any knowledge of the environmental or social costs - and to the complete surprise of most consumers. </p> <p>New government figures suggest that exports to China are running at 200,000 tonnes of plastic rubbish and 500,000 tonnes of paper and cardboard a year - a huge increase on just three years ago.</p> <p>Much of the plastic sent to China is packaging but a Guardian investigation has found that agents for Chinese companies are now buying up and exporting thousands of tonnes of unwashed bottles, containers, and other household waste.</p> <p>\"China is buying up everything it can. It is sucking in material from all over the world and it doesn't give two noodles what it takes,\" said one plastics recycler who asked not to be identified. \"I know of 300 firms, mostly in China, offering to buy my plastics. I have three or four companies cold-calling me every day from China requesting material. They have very cheap labour to sort the material but the shame is that it is being done there and not here. They don't care about the quality, or the contamination. No one checks what is sent or what arrives.\"</p> <p>The British plastics industry admits that the global trade is starving some local recycling initiatives of materials and putting established firms out of business or at risk. According to UK plastic recyclers, agents for Chinese companies areoffering \u00a3120 a tonne for mixed plastic bottles, far more than British companies can pay. \"The industry here can only support \u00a350 a tonne. We believe that 10-15,000 tonnes of old bottles are going to China. Yet only about 25,000 tonnes were collected last year\", said Stephen Chase of Chase Plastics.</p> <p>\"The Chinese put me out of business,\" said Edward Clack, a plastics recycler who invested in two recycling plants in Britain. \"Everyone has lost supplies to China. The local market is being starved of materials. Hundreds of brokers are buying up the plastic and shipping it out. It's cheaper to send a container to China than to Scotland.\"</p> <p>China drives the global waste trade, importing more than 3m tonnes of waste plastic and 15m tonnes of paper and board a year. But the trade is being driven equally by tough EU legislation forcing local authorities and businesses to recycle more. Landfill charges are rising steeply, making it relatively cheaper to send the waste abroad. Meanwhile, major companies have moved in, offering to collect and dispose of large quantities.</p> <p>The trade is made possible by the vast numbers of shipping containers arriving in Britain with Chinese exports. One of Britain's largest freight forwarding companies confirmed that the return waste trade to China is accelerating rapidly.</p> <p>\"We are shipping a phenomenal amount of waste, maybe 15,000 tonnes a week to China,\" said a spokesman for Warrant freight forwarders of Liverpool. The current price for sending a standard 26-tonne container of waste plastic to China, he said, is about \u00a3500.</p> <p>The Tanjin Songzi Import and Export Trade company based in the huge port of Tianjin Xingang is typical of the growing trade. \"We are specilize [sic] in import the scrap plastic bottle, waste plastic, waste paper. Europe origin. Please show me your offer,\" says its advertisement on an international plastics exchange website brimming with traders wanting the raw material for the Chinese industrial revolution.</p> <p>Most Chinese plastic waste importers want pictures of what they are buying, but some are are not fussy. \"We buy all types, such as the mineral water bottles, pure water bottles and plastic bottles of other drink. Any specifications will be fine. If you can supply, please email,\" says Mr Lee of a Shanghai company on the same site.</p> <p>Western plastic companies are setting up in China, but some of the poorest people are employed to sort and recycle the plastic. \"Plastic is now one of the biggest industries in Guangdong province, but much of the work is being done by migrant labour earning a pittance,\" said Martin Baker, of Greenpeace China.</p> <p>\"I would say that Britain is dumping its rubbish in the name of recycling. It is not responsible recycling that is being done. It is reprocessing, but the methods being used are still mostly rudimentary. There are some good factories, but on the whole it is small scale, done in backstreets with little environmental standards. People are burning plastic, sorting it by hand, the water gets polluted and it goes back into the rivers,\" he said.</p> <p>UK supermarket chains, some of the largest generators of plastic packaging waste in Britain, are all getting their recycling done in China, said a spokesman for Sainsbury's. \"We send 5,000 tonnes of plastic there a year. We used to send it to a firm in Nottinghamshire, but it has closed down,\" he said. \"We looked for others in Britain but no one could match the Chinese option for quantity or price. We would love to see it being recycled here, but it's not possible at present.\"</p> <p>But Ian Bowles, a spokesman for Asda, said he did not know where the company's plastic recycling was being done. \"UK companies pick it up. As far as we know it's being reprocessed here. It could be that excess quantities are going abroad.\" Other retailers known to be generating large quantities of plastic waste, including Tesco, did not respond to questions about where their recycling was being done.</p> <p>No detailed studies have been done of the environmental costs of shipping vast quantities of waste from Britain to China, but environment groups and MPs were yesterday shocked at the scale of the trade. \"Exporting lightweight packaging waste to China makes little sense environmentally,\" said Liberal Democrat MP Sue Doughty. \"It is a failure of the UK recycling market which allows the UK to export plastic for recycling. We have no control over environmental standards in China. Instead of solving the problem we are exporting it. Much more needs to be done to stimulate the markets in the UK so that waste is handled as close as possible to the point of generation.\"</p> <p>Clare Wilton, wastes spokeswoman for Friends of the Earth, said: \"People will be shocked that some of the newspapers and empty drinks bottles they put out for recycling can end up in China. It's an environmental disgrace. The solution is to expand the UK's own recycling industry. This would be good for the environment, create local jobs and help Britain become a leader in green technology.\"</p> <p>Sending plastic bottles to China is \"barmy\", said Mike Croxford, manager of Newport Wastesavers, which collects 50 tonnes a month of plastic from 50,000 homes in south Wales. \"We should be dealing with the stuff here, but the reality now is that most plastic in Britain is going abroad. I don't think the public knows where some of it goes. If they knew it was going right round the world, they might not encourage it.\"</p> <p>But other recyclers said it was better to send rubbish to China to be recycled than to put it in landfill in Britain. Andrew Simmons of the Peterborough-based waste charity Recoup buys millions of plastic bottles from UK councils, bales them up, and sells them to a reprocessor who then sells them on to Europe or, increasingly, to China. He rejected claims that Britain was dumping its rubbish on China and said that the environmental cost of sending bottles thousands of miles was negligible compared with making \"virgin\" plastic bottles from oil.</p> <p>China is increasingly aware that countries are exporting their pollution to them and have imposed strict laws governing what can be exported. Large amounts of German household waste have been found and all waste exports from Japan have recently been halted after electronic and contaminated household waste was found. However, the Chinese authorities, plagued by corruption, are unable to check the contents of all the waste containers that arrive in Chinese ports every year.</p> <p>British plastic bottles are mostly sent to Hong Kong where they are sorted and \"flaked\" before being sent to factories on the mainland. \"One type of plastic bottle goes on to make soft furnishings and clothes, another is made into pellets which are sold back to European manufacturers to make things like plastic bags,\" said Mr Simmons.</p> <p>This insatiable demand for the world's rubbish, he said, has actually boosted the British market for plastic recyclers, raising the price and making it far more worthwhile for councils to collect and not dump it in landfill. Partly because of this, more than half of all British local authorities now offer plastic recycling.</p> <p>More and more British plastic is likely to go to China, said Tim Frier of Valpac, whose subsidiary, Valiant, collects waste from more than 5,000 businesses in Britain, including supermarkets, pubs and clubs, and sends up to 15,000 tonnes of plastic to China a year. Valpac has just opened an office in China.</p> <p>\"We will be sending more there. But they have strict rules. The problem was that a lot of waste going to China was contaminated, and not being sorted properly. There were concerns about British waste, too,\" he said.</p> <p>The government insists that companies have export licences but few if any checks are made in British ports. The Environment Agency admits that it is unable to check what is being exported.</p> <p>\"There is a legitimate trade in waste exports for recovery involving materials such as paper, ferrous metals, plastics and card. These wastes are classed as 'green list' and are not subject to the same level of control as wastes classed as hazardous,\" said a spokesman.</p>",
  "<p>Charles Kennedy made plain the scale of his ambition yesterday when he declared his willingness to work with Labour - with or without a formal coalition - if his current success produces a hung parliament at the next election. </p> <p>As the Liberal Democrats' conference opened in Bourne-mouth after a year of steady electoral gains, Mr Kennedy said the three main parties would be on equal terms at the election, for the first time for a generation. </p> <p>Having admitted last week that he would not go into coalition with Michael Howard's Tories, Mr Kennedy was pressed yesterday to say the same about Labour. </p> <p>Though he damned Mr Blair for the Iraq war he did not demand the prime minister's resignation or rule out future cooperation with him or his successor. </p> <p>\"We will not get distracted by noises off. What we would do in a parliament with no overall control _ [is] what we have been doing for years in the House of Lords: judging each and every issue on its merits and determining our stance accordingly,\" he said. </p> <p>He said it was time West-minster recognised the need to change to proportional representation so Lib Dems need no longer be \"an opposition party\". </p> <p>The implication of his remarks is that he is open to a weakened Labour government's offers of PR, which eluded Paddy Ashdown in 1997, or to the kind of ad hoc cooperation which shored up the Callaghan Labour government in the 70s. </p> <p>With a weather-vane by-election in Labour-held Hartlepool on September 30, Mr Kennedy's lieutenants have a tactical as well as strategic interest in proving they are not soft on crime, or irre-sponsible on tax-and-spend issues. </p> <p>A Times/Populus poll released today suggests Mr Kennedy is seen as moving to the party to the right. </p> <p>But faced with Labour charges that he is becoming \"a crypto-Thatcherite\" and Tory charges that he is a Labour leftwinger, Mr Kennedy dis-missed a \"mechanistic\" view of politics which \"ignores morality and momentum\".</p>",
  "<p>Greg Dyke, the former director general of the BBC, says he is \"unnerved and depressed\" by the direction in which his successors are taking the corporation. </p> <p>Eight months after leaving his post at the request of the BBC's governors, Mr Dyke has attacked Mark Thompson, the new director general, for allowing rumours of job cuts to circulate and for failing, along with the new chairman, Michael Grade, to capitalise on the findings of the Butler report on Iraq. </p> <p>Mr Dyke, 57, left the BBC after Lord Hutton, in his inquiry into events leading up to the death of David Kelly, criticised reporting errors by Andrew Gilligan on the Today programme. </p> <p>In a subsequent inquiry into the use of intelligence in the build-up to the war in Iraq, however, Lord Butler upheld Gilligan's report that aspects of the government's dossier on Iraq's banned weapons were flawed. \"Butler killed Hutton,\" said Mr Dyke, who wants to see the corporation reassert itself more aggressively in the wake of the inquiries. \"The BBC has stopped defending itself. As a new chairman and a new director general, you'd rather not be involved, wouldn't you? But I don't think that's an option. I think at some stage they've got to come out. The longer they stay quiet the worse it gets.\" </p> <p>In his first big newspaper interview since leaving his job in January Mr Dyke effectively calls on Tony Blair to resign: \"Go back to what the prime minister said to Hutton; 'If any of this had been true, I'd have had to resign.' Well, we now know most of it was true, Mr Blair, so why are you still in office?\" </p> <p>The former BBC chief was once a substantial donor to Labour. </p> <p>Mr Dyke criticised Mr Thompson's failure to put an end to rumours of job cuts at the BBC, in the lead-up to charter renewal in 2006. \"I'm unnerved about some of the things that have been happen ing in terms of the staff. I'd hate to think they're going to lose that relationship that we built. </p> <p>\"I hear them [the management] say, 'Oh, we're going to have to sack loads of people.' The whole place must be unnerved. You don't announce that you might get rid of people, because they all sit there destabilised. I think it's a mistake. That's not a great way of running a place.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Isn't it depressing that the way to appeal to a Labour government these days is to say you'll fire loads of people?\" Since leaving the BBC, Mr Dyke has written a book and made a television programme about his experiences. He has continued to be critical of the government's conduct in the lead-up to the war. \"We went to war on the basis of a set of crappy intelligence reports that someone within government knew was nonsense,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Dyke blames Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former director of communications, for having exercised inappropriate influence over Downing Street and Mr Blair for having listened to him. \"It is on Blair's conscience whether he should still be prime minister.\" </p> <p>He cites the poor state of the Conservatives and the strength of the economy as the only things keeping the prime minister in office. \"I think the damage to Blair is incalculable. I think he'll win the election, because there's nothing else and Gordon Brown has done a great job on the economy.\" </p> <p>Mr Dyke tells how he expected that the BBC's governors would support him in the aftermath of the Hutton report: \"On the day that I left, it had never crossed my mind that these silly bastards would respond in this way. Never crossed my mind.\" </p> <p>He also claims that the governors would have supported him if he had been from a posher background. </p> <p>Mr Dyke said he intended to vote tactically for the Liberal Democrats in the next election. </p>",
  "<p>An angry father perched on a Buckingham Palace ledge in a Batman suit may have seemed a bit of a laugh but the stunt raised some potentially uncomfortable legal issues. For a start, Batman (Jason Hatch) could easily have been shot. His sidekick, Dave Pyke (dressed as Robin), was following him up the ladder when an officer pointed a handgun at him and shouted \"Come down or I will shoot\". So down he came. </p> <p>Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens pointed out that the alarms and CCTV had operated and that if it had been thought that Batman was carrying a bomb \"he would have been shot\". Terrorists may now have noticed that silly clothes seem to gain the wearer free access to both Parliament and royal palaces. </p> <p>Thankfully, the media were not reporting shootings but providing the very oxygen of publicity that Fathers 4 Justice craved. The Daily Mirror boasted last week that its reporters were at the group's weekend summit (which apparently turned into a foul-mouthed drinking session). And they would have been aware that this was not merely boasting - Hatch is due in court later this year concerning a demonstration on Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. The Daily Mail was also in the know and printed 12 photographs, showing the protesters from the moment they jumped the railings and propped a ladder against the side of the building, to Hatch's eventual descent, six hours later, in a cherry picker. Spirited undercover reporting or aiding and abetting criminal acts? </p> <p>The Mirror was not particularly taken with the campaigners of Fathers 4 Justice, but justified its substantial coverage as an expos\u00e9 of the vulnerability of royal security - following on from its scoop last year when one of its reporters posed as a royal footman for two months. The Sun has gone one step further than the Mirror, by putting a hack in a staff job at the House of Commons and allowing him to smuggle in a fake bomb. </p> <p>But when newspapers get too close to criminals, or criminal conduct, there can be unexpected repercussions. The media are not protected from the criminal law by any special reporting dispensation. When BBC reporter Mark Daly went undercover to film The Secret Policeman in Manchester, for example, he was arrested for obtaining a pecuniary advantage (his wages) by deception, and damaging police property. </p> <p>Criminal law does not just punish those who actually commit offences but also those who conspire to do so or \"aid and abet\" wrongdoers. And this is where media organisations are vulnerable when they find themselves too close to protesters. Newspaper publishers (and reporters) have enough money to pay fines and, unlike protesters, don't actually want their staff to go to jail. </p> <p> The Accessories and Abetters Act, passed in 1861, makes those who aid and abet indictable offences liable to be tried and punished as a principal offender. The Magistrates Court Act of 1980 covers lesser offences tryable by magistrates rather than a jury and the state tends to bring those claim ing a higher ethical purpose before magistrates rather than a jury. </p> <p>There are some legal safeguards - one has to wilfully encourage the crime and mere voluntary presence at the scene of the crime is not necessarily sufficient. However, worryingly for journalists, the reported cases show that if someone witnesses the commission of a crime and offers no opposition, though he might reasonably be expected to have tried to prevent it (or at least express his dissent), this might provide sufficient evidence for a conviction for aiding and abetting. Photographers and reporters beware. </p> <p>Another possible concern is that the criminal law in its wisdom allows the conviction of a secondary party, in certain circumstances, when the actual perpetrator of the substantive offence is either acquitted or convicted of a lesser offence. </p> <p>The secondary party may also be convicted where the law breaker has some defence that does not benefit the secondary party. The textbook cases include a husband aiding and abetting when forcing his wife to commit buggery with a dog - she had a defence of duress. But suppose protest groups start using children to commit their trespasses and burglaries? </p> <p>With MPs now targeted, as well as royalty and global corporations, there may be little sympathy from the state for journalists caught up in the wrongdoing of others, even if they only intended to get the best pictures rather than commit a crime. </p> <p>The Press Complaints Commission Code of Practice requires newspapers to maintain the highest professional standards, but other than requiring accuracy and that criminals should be not be paid for stories (unless in the public interest) it allows newspapers to be partisan and to decide for themselves what the main stories of the day are - whether or not that involves being manipulated by pressure groups. </p> <p>But broadcasters have tougher regulations still. The BBC producers' guidelines require that news should be presented with due accuracy and impartiality and that the BBC has the editorial input necessary when wit nessing or reporting ongoing illegal activity (such as the trespass at the palace). Criminals are not allowed to glamorise their wrongdoing. </p> <p>The Ofcom code too is wary of protest stunts. \"Programmes should neither glamorise nor condone criminals or their actions\". The code does say that crime is rarely without victims, but Batman at Buck House caused little distress to anyone. </p> <p>The amount of publicity in the newspapers and on television will only encourage this particular pressure group, and no doubt many others, to embark upon similar stunts. Greenpeace takes its own film crews along when involved in direct action and the ALA has videoed attacks on farms and laboratories. These tapes were made available to the media, and television regulators require considerable care when using such third-party material as the images can be a lot less fair, accurate and impartial than they look at first. </p> <p>The various media regulators' codes may need to be tightened to take account of this new non-violent attention-grabbing, although a template exists. Broadcasters do take care already to deny free publicity to those who disrupt football games or race meetings - streakers are a rarity on screen nowadays. </p> <p>The media have a self-imposed obligation to report what is actually going on and editors, not judges, are best able to evaluate what is of interest to their readers. Some high-profile stunts, such as last week's invasion of the House of Commons, are (presumably) intended to highlight causes where there is considerable public support. But a claim to be exposing lapses in security may not always be sufficient to justify a crime. The police knew what Hatch was up to and exercised common sense judgment rather than pulling a trigger, and one would not want the presence of the media to provoke a more extreme response against non-terrorist protesters. </p> <p>A further worry for the media is that the family of a shot protester could sue the media for damages if it could be shown that the journalist put him up to it, compensation culture being what it is. The police would have a defence, the media not. </p> <p>Reporting protest is beyond the law but encouraging even honourable criminal stunts is not. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Duncan Lamont is a media partner at City solicitors Charles Russell</p>",

  "<p>The Royal Society will today launch a year-long inquiry into the feasibility of developing drugs which are tailored to an individual patient's genetic makeup. </p> <p>Leading figures from Britain's national science academy aim to \"cut through the hype\" surrounding the new science of pharma-cogenetics and examine the economic practicality of developing personalised drugs. </p> <p>While the promise of drugs designed to work with particular genetic types could bring safer and more effective treatment for everyone, many experts have questioned the cost of such a revolutionary step and said that it might not be technologically feasible to develop the drugs in the near future. </p> <p>The independent study will \"cut through the hype that has surrounded this particular area that has arisen from the mapping of the human genome and producing new drugs that are tailored to the genetic makeup of an individual,\" the the Royal Society said. </p> <p>\"We are talking about an exciting new era of medicine. We have got this information from the human genome and we are potentially talking about large new developments. But at this stage we must be realistic about those developments. </p> <p>\"We will be asking whether this is technologically realistic and what timescale could we see. We will also look at the economics and ask whether it is realistic to expect the pharmaceutical industry to produce these [drugs].\" </p> <p>Drug companies have come under fire for admitting that most of their standard mass-produced or \"blockbuster\" drugs do not work for everyone. In some areas they are effective in as few as 30% to 50% of cases. </p> <p>Genetic differences can cause one person to react positively to a drug while another fails to respond. </p> <p>But environmental and social factors are always an influence and personalised drugs are no panacea, because in a relatively few areas do genes wholly determine that a person will develop a disease. </p> <p>Scientists point out that while the commercial pharmaceutical industry is investing in pharmacogenetics, its profits depend on blockbuster drugs. It may prove too costly for private companies to develop or offer a vast range of drugs tailored to specific genetic types which only sell in small volumes. </p> <p>It could also be prohibitively expensive for the NHS, although a new generation of genetically tailored drugs would not necessarily create a spiralling NHS bill: they could bring down the cost of some treatments if they are more effective medicines. </p> <p>The working group of seven scientists, chaired by Sir David Weatherall, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, includes leading pharmacologists in academia. </p> <p>It will call for evidence from industry, academics and the government. </p> <p>The society's final study - to be published next summer - aims to make a series of recommendations for research and government, including where best to put money for future research in the field. </p> <p>\"This study will look at whether pharmacogenetics, the designing of drug treatments based on a person's genetic makeup, is a scientifically achievable aim, be it five, 10, or 25 years from now,\" Sir David said. </p> <p>\"Equally important, it will look at whether healthcare systems in the UK and elsewhere have the resources to implement such technologies and what the pharmaceutical industry's assessment is of the significant investment needed to try to develop them in the first place.\" </p> <p>The Royal Society added: \"To make this new generation of drugs available, you not only need a way for companies to make this medicine, but you also clearly need to look at how the NHS could cope with it. Can they afford it?\" </p> <p>Human rights groups have expressed the fear that the development could lead to widespread genetic profiling and testing of individuals to determine their suitability for certain drugs. </p> <p>The control of this information and the availability of genetic data about workers to employers, for example, could be a sensitive issue.</p>",
  "<p>If there's one thing journalists love, it's an annual report. Not necessarily because we understand them (we rarely do) or even because of the opportunity to question senior figures about the running of a company or its strategy. No, what we love are the little tables at the back which detail how much everyone's paid. It's an opportunity to gorge on outrage, hypocrisy and downright disingenuous moralising that few of us can resist. </p> <p>Apparently it's not just us, either. Not judging by the number of phone calls from television executives to this office last week, one of which was someone ringing just to shout \"Have you SEEN what they're paying at Ofcom?\" four or five times before descending incoherently into sobs. </p> <p>Annual report dissection is of course a democratic sport - we'll take apart FTSE 100 directors or public servants with equal and predictable glee. In fact, the BBC is so anaesthetised to the yearly howl of outrage at Alan Yentob's pension fund that it issues the hot figures in advance of the publication of its annual report, just so that the financial performance and future strategy of the corporation can get some coverage too. </p> <p>Ironically, it was a senior Ofcom executive who once told my colleague Emily Bell that the problem was that journalists weren't paid enough so they approached everything from a position of aggrieved envy. He was of course entirely correct on both counts. So I took a few soundings on the unveiling of the Ofcom salary levels - just to check that I wasn't being unduly influenced by the penury of Farringdon Road. </p> <p>I learned that there's no point asking how salaries can be so high at what is effectively a monopoly regulator. That's just missing the point. These salaries are absolutely necessary if we're going to stop the regulatory talent drain. In this country, we're blessed with the finest regulators in the world and I for one think that if \u00a3350k is the price we have to pay to keep them on our shores, it's a price worth paying. </p> <p>OK, enough. Here's a serious suggestion from a BBC executive who has been engaged in the consultation process around moving half the corporation up north. That plan, which was extremely close to being fact under Greg Dyke before he became a freelance personality, is laid out in its policy document, Building Public Value. It commits the BBC to basing a fifth of network commissioning, half of its UK public service staff and at least \u00a31bn worth of programming outside London. </p> <p>Why are they doing it? They would argue that there are sound economic reasons why this change is good for the BBC, for the industry and for the country. No other modern economy is so dominated by a single city as the UK. The government recognises it, which is why Gordon Brown is committed to moving thousands of civil service jobs out of the capital. A BBC that spends the licence fee more equitably around the country is a BBC that understands it has a role to play in the national economy. Moving services, people and money out of London is an attempt to break the concentration of broadcasting power in London. Move commissioning ability and real money to somewhere like Manchester and you just might start a snowball effect. </p> <p>So here's the idea: let's stop wasting our time, energy and of course envy on begrudging those at Ofcom their salaries. There are good people there - some very good people - and they've got difficult jobs to do in a time of massive technological change. Instead, let's ask why they have to do it in London. </p> <p>Ofcom has rightly tightened the rules around regional production. The traditional fiddles of broadcasters and producers won't work any more (burn that letterhead which represents the country retreat as the south-west office). From next year, regional production will actually have to be regional. This is going to change a lot of people's lives, force a lot of families to move and provoke some difficult choices. Ofcom could demonstrate that it understands both the need for regionalisation and the impact it will have on individuals by doing the same thing and moving its operation out of London. </p> <p>Imagine if Ofcom traded its fantastic Thames-side office with its floor-to-ceiling windows for one in Brum. Birmingham's average income is below the national average of \u00a325,057. The average Ofcom salary is \u00a343,000 and its total staff costs (in an 11-month year, mind) were \u00a313.4m. Imagine the impact that would have on the economy of the West Midlands. Imagine the effect on local hotels and restaurants of the entire media and telecoms industries visiting Birmingham to consult with Ofcom. Imagine the impact on Ofcom's culture if it was closer to the people on whose behalf it regulates. </p> <p>It's a simple idea - and not mine, so I can say what a brilliant one it is. I can't imagine any reason why Ofcom wouldn't want to do it when to do so would illustrate so well why they're worth so much of the public's money. And Stephen, just think how far \u00a3370,769 would go ...</p>",
  "<p>When I left Guyana for England in 1977 with my partner and my daughter, we brought most of our books but left all our paintings behind. These were distributed among my brother, sisters and friends for safe-keeping or as gifts. Years later I lamented this, sorely missing these images. One painting in particular haunted me. It had been given to us by a young Guyanese artist, Keith Khan. I remembered its mysterious serenity, its warm background colours, the figure rising like a sphinx from the blue ruins of a wall. Although on visits home I looked for it several times, it wasn't until seven years ago that I finally found it, behind a bedstead in our old family home. I brought it back with me to England, where it attests to the power of art to haunt us, to stick in the memory and nourish the spirit. </p> <p>The ability of the artist to transmute paints into forms, shapes and feelings has always been a source of wonder to me. Equally fascinating is the interplay between art-forms - the way poetry, sculpture, music and painting relate to each other. I feel the relationship between painting and poetry is a particularly close one. Both come out of a desire to make something new of the familiar, to capture an experience in a living, concentrated way. Both share a harmony, structure, colour and rhythm; in the compositional balance of a painting, one can almost speak of one colour \"rhyming\" with another. </p> <p>A few years ago I was invited to be poet-in-residence at the Tate Gallery (now Tate Britain) by the then-visual arts director, Colin Grigg. The residency involved responding to paintings through poetry (very appealing) as well as conducting some workshops with children from primary schools around London (which seemed like work). It proved to be a challenging space to work in: you are in full view of passing visitors, who listen in to what is happening. </p> <p>The children who took part in workshops were not in the least overawed by the gallery, or the onlookers. They wrote poems in response to the paintings and - in a spontaneous coming together of written word and visual image - often put a drawing in their pads beside their poems. It was very much like a Chinese painter placing a verse in those vacant spaces that allow Chinese painting to breathe. </p> <p>For these children, this was the most natural thing in the world. There was no separation between word and image, the blank page and the blank canvas. And there have been several poets and painters who have shared this experience. The Spanish poet Rafael Alberti began as a painter and went on to coin the expression \"liricografia\" or \"painted poem\". The Bengali Rabindranath Tagore, by contrast, began as a poet and found himself doodling on the page proofs of his poetry. He won the Nobel prize for literature - and raised more than a few eyebrows with his late turning to painting. Similarly, Caribbean poet Derek Walcott, also a Nobel winner, has for years been a devoted watercolour-painter. His latest book, Tiepolo's Hound, is a homage to Camille Pissarro, the impressionist who was born in the island of St Thomas in what was then the Danish West Indies. </p> <p>The poems I wrote during my residency were not an attempt to explain the paintings, their stories and hidden narratives, but more of an interpretation, a way of seeing and sometimes giving a piece a voice. But would the poem based on the painting grow from the perspective of the onlooker or from a character within the painting? Would it enter into a dialogue? \"Perspective\" in painting, I discovered, is related to \"voice\" in poetry. </p> <p>Picasso's Weeping Woman, with its haggard, fractured features and clash of colours, made me want to give that haunting face a voice. In the end I wrote in the voice of Dora Maar, the woman on whose face Weeping Woman is based: </p> <p>They say that instead of a brush </p> <p>he used a knife on me - </p> <p>a savage geometry. </p> <p>But as I say, look again, </p> <p>this is the closest </p> <p>anyone has got to the pain. </p> <p>Green knows me - </p> <p>Not the green of new shoots, </p> <p>but the ghastly green of gangrene. </p> <p>Yellow knows me - </p> <p>Not the cheery yellow of the sun </p> <p>but the sickly hues </p> <p>of this war's putrefaction. </p> <p>Blue knows me - </p> <p>Not the boundless blues of sky or sea </p> <p>but the blues of the singer's </p> <p>deepest sorrow. </p> <p>Mother Dolorosa, </p> <p>this grief has got to me. </p> <p>Under the poise of my red hat </p> <p>I hear, as if from a great </p> <p>distance, </p> <p>my own stifled scream. </p> <p>Maar, a talented photographer and artist in her own right, was one of Picasso's several \"muse-mistresses\". She suffered a mental breakdown as their relationship deteriorated. Without consciously setting out to do so, my poem about her developed into an entire sequence of poems. It was almost as though I were seeking to echo Picasso's fractured cubistic style with her fractured voice. </p> <p>The residency gave my old love affair with painting a new jolt. It made me more aware of the balance and composition in a painting, the play of light and shadow, the energy and colour. Most of all I became aware of the life-giving force of the inner rhythm, my eyes following those curves and lines, up and down, round and about. I spend more time with a painting now. Honest. </p> <p>The visual impact of a painting can be immediate. We have it all before us: images, colour, forms, a stimulating eye-feast. At a glance we can see the tension in Degas' Little Dancer, the compelling energy of Van Gogh's brushstrokes, the conflicting emotions captured on a face. </p> <p>A poem, though, communicates in a more subliminal way, unfolding through the senses as you go along. Not until the end of the poem - sometimes even later - do we feel its resonance or have its meaning dawn on us. And though the music of a poem is compelling, it is the image-making power of poetry, the pictures created by words that stay in the memory and haunt the imagination, that brings for me the most surprise and delight. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Grace Nichols's Paint Me a Poem is published by A&amp;C Black on September 20, priced \u00a312.99.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing lasts forever. Especially not Real Madrid manager Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho. Just three games into the season, the man with the famously sweaty pits, the soothing presence of a rhino in a playground, and an obsession with 'huevos', or balls, has quit in a huff. Again. </p> <p>He lasted 115 days. Which really isn't very good, although it is slightly better than his last stint as coach at the Bernab\u00e9u, when he managed to walk out after 23 and without taking charge for a single match. The first time, Camacho walked because the then president Lorenzo Sanz wouldn't let him chose his own back-room staff; this time it's not just the president but the players too who are the problem. </p> <p>After long conversations with Ra\u00fal, Helguera, M\u00edchel Salgado and Roberto Carlos (but not, noticeably, the ever-petulant Guti, one of the club's captains), Camacho resigned yesterday, insisting that he couldn't take it any more, that he could not control the dressing-room, that he had lost the support of the club heavyweights. </p> <p>P\u00e9rez refused to accept and a final decision will be made today, but it's hard to see Camacho, as stubborn as a mule with his feet nailed to the floor, backing down now. All the more so as everyone knows about it - as straight down the line as Daniella Westbrook, Camacho's not the kind of bloke to lose face. Nor, though, is P\u00e9rez. </p> <p>Now, the Spanish press like nothing more than a good old crisis, as gratuitously inflated as a bright orange balloon emblazoned with David Mellor's grinning mug, but this time it's true: Madrid are in crisis. A proper crisis. A real crisis. A galactic one. </p> <p>They were rubbish but lucky 1-0 winners in their opening two league games against relegation candidates Numancia and Mallorca and weren't just beaten but utterly humiliated by Bayer Leverkusen in Europe - a performance so bad that Diego Maradona called them \"a bunch of dogs\". And then on Saturday night came the final straw. Madrid lost 1-0 against Espanyol at Montjuic with a display of slapstick genius that also managed to sum up so much of what's wrong. </p> <p>It had everything. Two red cards, for Walter Samuel and M\u00edchel Salgado; first-choice goalkeeper Iker Casillas getting injured in the warm-up; reserve keeper C\u00e9sar S\u00e1nchez saving Ra\u00fal Tamudo's penalty - twice - before getting injured himself; a penalty miss from Ronaldo; Roberto Carlos bombing about aimlessly up front; Guti telling the fourth official he's a \"son of a bitch and a clown\"; and no sign whatsoever of a reaction, or any football, from Madrid. </p> <p>Oh, and four gal\u00e1cticos missing. Which rather says it all. With Luis Figo and Zinedine Zidane already injured, Camacho responded to the Champions League disaster in classic, subtle style - by dropping David Beckham and, at last, captain Ra\u00fal. </p> <p>It was a powerful, aggressive statement of intent from a man disgusted with the attitude of his players, the gal\u00e1ctico culture and the way the club is run. But it was also, at long last a capitulation in the face of pressure from within and without to drop the untouchable yet frankly awful Ra\u00fal. It was, said AS on Saturday morning, a revolution. But it didn't work. </p> <p>\"When you thump a fist on the desk you either break the desk or you break your hand, nothing else happens,\" said Roberto Carlos, really saying it all about Camacho's attitude and the players' reading of him. A bruiser and a bully, Camacho is not the right man for the job, unable to control the hardest thing to control at Madrid - the dressing-room. </p> <p>Which is a bit of a downer, what with that being precisely why P\u00e9rez brought Camacho in - his third coach in as many seasons, a record that even Jes\u00fas Gil would be proud of. First P\u00e9rez got rid of Vicente Del Bosque because he was cuddly, had a brilliant moustache and was the son of a railway trade unionist (\"not modern enough\", ran the official reason). Then, he opted for, and made a scapegoat of, Carlos Queiroz when Madrid achieved nothing (except a great new club record of five successive defeats, of course). </p> <p>Never mind that the squad was too short, that Queiroz pleaded for a centre-back and a defensive midfielder, or that he wasn't allowed to play Celades, who left, or Cambiasso, who didn't but might as well have done. No, it was all Queiroz's fault. He was too soft, too permissive of the capricious gal\u00e1cticos. </p> <p>Not to worry, fans' favourite Camacho would sort them out (even if P\u00e9rez did buy him Owen when he wanted Vieira). A tough-tackling Madrid legend with a foul mouth and a pair of 'huevos' the size of the Bernab\u00e9u, famous for marking Johan Cruyff out of his first derbi, was brought in to provide some discipline, to make the gal\u00e1cticos sweat almost as profusely as he does. Squat, ugly, far from refined, he was the very antithesis of gal\u00e1ctico - and that was what Madrid needed. </p> <p>Only it wasn't. Camacho has walked into a special environment, already rarified by galactically myopic P\u00e9rez's marketing-obsessed handling of the club, which causes division and resentment and has left some big-name stars and smaller-name-but-no-less-important players longing to leave. Camacho resents his president's impositions and has found himself unable to handle the dressing-room. Rather than unite his players, his bulldozing style, big mouth and rather unsubtle training regime has served only to divide. </p> <p>His constant outbursts against \"pointless fancy flicks\" have irritated Zidane; his complaints over lack of effort have got backs up, as have his very public harangues; his substitutions of Figo and Ronaldo, while leaving Ra\u00fal on (in central midfield!), have caused resentment and whispers of favourable treatment for his captain; and while there is perspiration now, there is little inspiration - Madrid have scored just twice in four games, with Roberto Carlos privately complaining that he is no longer allowed to attack. </p> <p>Camacho is a motivator but he has all the technical and tactical insight of a lump of plywood. Which is all well and good if your players are that talented. But when you lose the ability to motivate it is, as Camacho has admitted, time to walk. </p>",
  "<b> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday September 22 2004</b> <br>  In the report below we attribute to the Bishop of Ripon, the Rt Rev John Packer, a phrase which he did not utter. We say he felt the suspension of the Dean of Ripon and the independent inquiry which had been ordered, was the only way to \"lance the boil\". The phrase was the Guardian reporter's and not the bishop's. Apologies.      A row that has engulfed one of Britain's oldest cathedrals came to a head yesterday with the suspension of its dean - effectively the church's managing director - on suspicion of \"unbecoming conduct\". <p>The Bishop of Ripon announced the unusual move, against the Very Rev John Methuen, formerly one of the 33 church commissioners who control Anglican shares and property assets, at morning service in the 1,300-year-old church. </p> <p>The bishop, the Right Rev John Packer, said suspension and an independent inquiry, probably leading to a church court action, was the only way to \"lance the boil\". </p> <p>He told the congregation that the move was the best course \"to eliminate as far as possible continued pressure and gossip\". </p> <p>Dean Methuen has been embroiled in an increasingly acrid dispute with other local clergy and church staff, who accuse him of \"control freakery\" and trying to run the ancient Yorkshire foundation as a despot, for over two years. </p> <p>There has been controversy over money-raising ventures for the building, whose adventures since St Wilfrid founded it in 672 have left it with vast repair bills and a leaking roof. </p> <p>A supper for local businesses in the nave and a freemasons' service where the dean blessed masonic regalia caused particular resentment. </p> <p>The proceedings against the dean are officially known as an inhibition, which suspends him from his \u00a326,000-a-year post while an independent examiner - a senior lawyer yet to be named - examines the case against him. </p> <p>This includes more than 150 written complaints to Bishop Packer last year after he invited his flock to specify their grievances. </p> <p>The examiner is expected to recommend a full trial of the issue in a consistory or church court, the only authority which can sack a priest for \"conduct unbecoming the office and work of a clerk in holy orders\". </p> <p>The inquiry will go back to 1995, when Dean Methuen moved to Ripon - a diocese which also includes the vastly larger city of Leeds. </p> <p>Matters came to a head two years ago when Ripon's chapter clerk, organist and bursar resigned in succession in protest against the allegedly autocratic behaviour of the dean and his refusal to work as a team player. </p> <p>Dean Methuen has largely followed a policy of refusing to comment on the charges but yesterday afternoon he issued a rebuttal. </p> <p>Accusing Bishop Packer of needlessly freezing him out of his ministry, he said: \"I would like to state categorically that I am entirely innocent of any complaints against me. I am deeply saddened that matters concerning Ripon Cathedral remain unresolved and that the bishop has decided to institute formal processes.\" </p> <p>Bishop Packer said that the suspension was essential to resolve a dispute which had deteriorated into a mess of accusations and rumour. </p> <p>He told the congregation: \"The dean is clear that he has a full answer to the complaints. However to eliminate as far as possible continued pressure and gossip, I have decided to inhibit the dean from the exercise of his office until such time as these matters are disposed of, either by a rejection of the complaints by an independent examiner, or by means of a trial in a consistory court.\" </p> <p>A consistory hearing will not be held until the beginning of next year at the earliest. </p> <p>Like most clergy, the dean has freehold tenure of his office and can only be sacked - a move known as defrocking - if found guilty of serious misconduct by a consistory court. </p> <p>Ironically, Ripon's founder was accused of high-handed behaviour and was twice sacked from his bishopric. He persisted in appeals to Rome and was responsible for Anglo-Saxon England following Roman rather than Celtic church practices.</p>",
  "<p>Natasha Brown sings about sex with the confidence of a 30-year-old. One song on her debut album, Muscle Tight, warns women to keep their \"zum-zum\" taut while recent single Bedroom Bully is similarly salacious. \"Oh God, that one is very off the hook. That's about sex and ... whatever,\" she giggles, embarrassed. Her modesty makes it the more disturbing to think that she was just 15 when she began recording her album, Miss Jamaica. She's now 17 - and her first child is due next month. </p> <p>As a dancehall deejay (the Jamaican word for MC), Brown - who performs under the name Ms Thing - is following in the footsteps of artists such as Marion \"Lady Saw\" Hall. \"You know her lyrics are raunchy,\" the teenager exclaims gleefully. \"I look up to she.\" Lady Saw is one of Jamaica's leading deejays, renowned for her scandalous banter. </p> <p>Lewd lyrics litter dancehall songs. But so does homophobia, to the distress of dancehall stars such as Sean Paul. He feels that the lyrics of controversial artists such as Beenie Man and Vybz Kartel have been \"hurting the music on a monumental level\". Brown, who has recorded with both Beenie Man and Kartel, shares similar sentiments. \"As a big entertainer people look up to Moses [Beenie Man] especially,\" she says in thick patois. \"I think he should just res' it a bit.\" </p> <p>But while Brown renounces homophobia, she revels in the sexually explicit. She agrees wordplay she contributed to Beenie Man's Jamaican number one Dude - \"I want a dude who will do me in his van/ A thug that can handle his biz like a man\" - was perhaps inappropriate for a girl her age. So why did she sing them? \"Ah,\" she sighs. \"You know to keep up with them here in Jamaica, you have to. And in Jamaica age don't mean anything about music. You just do music,\" she shrugs. </p> <p>Questionable lyrics aside, Miss Jamaica is an accomplished effort. Malleable middle-eastern instrumentation, electro-tinged steel pan and determined drum patterns are punctuated by Ms Thing's forcible vocals. It's not all about sex, either; she takes care to promote the woman who prefers to be independent rather than rinsing a man for \"Bimmers\" and jewellery. \"I'm a regular girl. I'm not like, 'I want this and that,'\" she insists. </p> <p>Brown still lives in the area where she was born. Cooreville Gardens, Kingston, is much like any working-class neighbourhood found in the capital. The baking sun and scorched earth cover everything with dust while young men play basketball in a make-do court. It's far from the notoriously violent slums of Downtown, but it's certainly worlds apart from the hushed hillside-set Uptown, favoured by the likes of Sean Paul. \"We have a lot of teachers and police live here,\" Brown says, stopping to sign an autograph for a soldier who wanders nonchalantly into the house. A machete hangs on the wall, an uncooked chicken swelters in the kitchen sink, while knick-knacks and plastic flowers cover every available surface. It's modest, maybe, and a little crowded but, Brown points out, she has much to be thankful for. \"My community is very different from Tivoli - those places are the warzone. But this is residential here, so I don't really experience much of the war. I'm comfortable with where I'm living. It's crime free, violence free here.\" </p> <p>Brown's father, a policeman, was murdered in a drive-by shooting when she was just two years old. \"He was living in America then and he decided to stop off at this club in New York after work,\" she says. \"He and his babymother die together 'cause they shot up the car.\" Her mother, Charmaine Brown, lives round the corner with her younger sister, Pretania, six. Charmaine remembers her eldest daughter singing \"since she was little\", but even she was surprised by Natasha's rapid success. </p> <p>Brown got her big break in 2002 after impersonating another dancehall artist, Baby Cham, at a party for his album launch. The very next day Cham's producer, Dave Kelly, Jamaica's ubiquitous go-to hit man, called Brown and requested her presence at his studio. The two immediately set about making music. \"I have to say thank God for that 'cause artists out here are dying to work with Dave Kelly. He's a legend; anything he hits go gold or platinum.\" </p> <p>Beenie Man got wind of this up-and-coming attitude-fuelled deejay and asked her to perform on Dude, also produced by Kelly. Whisked away from Cooreville and school, Brown toured the world with Beenie, promoting the single that has since sold well internationally. Until that point she had never left Jamaica, taken a holiday, or even picnicked in the nearby mountains. She did occasionally visit the local attraction park, Coney Island, but that shut down long ago. \"It's crazy,\" she says. \"The yout' need something to do, you know? To get away.\" </p> <p>Still, for Brown, escaping her surroundings has had its down sides. \"How I wanted things to end up, they didn't,\" she says. \"I didn't get to finish out my childhood. I just wanted to take things more slowly but things took off so quick.\" </p> <p>One casualty of overnight celebrity was the schoolwork. Some have claimed she was expelled from Tivoli Gardens Comprehensive, but Brown refutes these rumours. \"No, no. I was the one that decided to leave. I started messing up on my grades because I have to be going everywhere. So where's the time? But,\" she says proudly, \"what I did as a smart young girl was go to evening classes - computers, English and maths. Rumours in Jamaica are real rumours, trust me,\" she adds. \"But I live here so I'm used to them. If I focus on them it's going to get friction and war and trouble and violence. So I just try and stay focus' no matter what them say.\" </p> <p>Just as she was really establishing herself as a solo artist rather than Beenie Man's hook-for-hire, Brown fell pregnant. Again, contrary to tittle-tattle, it is not Beenie Man's child but her manager/fiance's, Andre Green, a quiet young man who today hovers by her side, providing soup and pineapple juice. They both agree that she was perhaps a little young to become a mother, but are eagerly anticipating their son's arrival. \"Behind backs you have people talking,\" Brown admits. \"Mostly they say, 'We happy for you', but sometimes they faceguard you in Jamaica - they're not straight up with you. Some people think I messed up my career.\" </p> <p>While she won't directly admit she may have made a mistake, Brown has decided things will be different once Andre Junior arrives in the world. There's a US and UK tour scheduled for next April and while she happily trots out the PR-correct talk of \"the sky's the limit and I'm going to reach for it\", she also admits what she really wants in life is far simpler than fame and fortune. \"I don't ever want to be far from my son. What I really want. No ...\" she stops herself. \"What I will be is a good mom,\" she decides. \"A young, good mom.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Miss Jamaica is out now on Sequence.</p>",
  "<p>French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has expressed cautious optimism about the fate of the two French journalists being held hostage in Iraq after a message purporting to be from their captors said they had been \"freed\" on condition that they stay in Iraq and write positive stories about the insurgents.</p> <p>The message, which appeared on an Islamist website, said Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot had \"willingly agreed\" to stay on and inform the west about the realities of the war and the \"truth\" about the Iraqi resistance.</p> <p>\"The Islamic Army in Iraq... has ended the imprisonment of two French journalists,\" the statement read.</p> <p>\"They are now conducting their work in agreement with the Islamic Army and it was agreed they work for the army to cover battles and attacks... for a limited period which has not been announced.\" </p> <p>The message, which has not been authenticated, is the first news in weeks about the fate of the two journalists, who disappeared over a month ago with their Syrian driver, Mohammed al-Joundi.</p> <p>It said mediation efforts to release the journalists had been halted \"after it became known that these mediating parties were either enemy spies or the enemy was spying on their communications\".</p> <p>The message said the hostages had been given their freedom because of France's objection to \"Allawi's agent army\" - a reference to plans for a training academy for senior Iraqi military officers in Iraq. But it said Mr al-Joundi was now on trial at the \"army's court\" for spying.</p> <p>Mr Raffarin said the message, which appeared on the Islam Memo website, appeared to be genuine.</p> <p>\"Today we have information which has not been authenticated 100% but which appears to us to be more serious than the previous ones,\" he told TF1 television in an interview. \"So we are slightly optimistic, but we must of course remain prudent.\"</p> <p>Freelance journalist Chesnot and Malbrunot, Le Figaro's Iraq correspondent, disappeared on August 20 during a trip to the southern city of Najaf.</p> <p>A group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and demanded that France revoke a new law banning religious symbols - including Islamic headscarves - from state schools.</p> <p>The French government refused to bow to the kidnappers' demands, but embarked on an unprecedented diplomatic mission across the Middle East to try to secure the freedom of the hostages.</p> <p>But ministers' initial optimism faded as calls from across the Arab world for the pair to be freed failed to yield results.</p> <p>In an interview published today the interior minister, Dominique de Villepin, warned there could be a long wait before the hostages were freed.</p> <p>\"There was a first phase in which we wanted to believe that our action could rapidly bring results,\" Mr de Villepin told the Republicain Lorrain newspaper.</p> <p>\"Today we are in a new phase where we have to know how to act with the long-term in mind to give them the greatest chance of being freed.\" </p> <p>\"All the indications seem to confirm that the hostages are alive.

But the FT hints that a final decision may still be postponed until after the US presidential election.</p> <p>A defiant editorial in the Times says the main aim of the insurgents is to prevent elections from taking place. \"It should not be impossible to create flexible arrangements so that the popular will can be expressed,\" the paper says, optimistically.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1308349,00.html\">Blair: we must win this new conflict</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,542-1270453,00.html\">Times: The crucible</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/20/wirq20.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/20/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: We face a new war</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=563620\">Independent: US determined to cut out 'cancer of Fallujah'</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/d9822712-0a49-11d9-a415-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Iraqi PM insists country is on schedule for polls</a></p> <p><b>LIB DEMS MEET WITH SCEPTICISM</b></p> <p>\"Kennedy willing to work with Labour,\" headlines the Guardian. \"Kennedy ducks the question on working with Labour,\" counters the Telegraph.

  "\"For my part, I am free to walk on the moors,\" wrote Charlotte Bronte in 1850, and yesterday - after a struggle which began before the Industrial Revolution - the rest of the country was finally able to join her. <p>Beaming with expectation, more than 100 ramblers set out from a car park behind the writer's famous home, Haworth Parsonage in the Pennines, to stamp their first legal footsteps on the heather round Alcomden Stones. </p> <p>They made up one of the most emotional of the 200 \"birthday parties\" held to mark the introduction of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which gives walkers the right to stray from footpaths over hundreds of square miles of the northern fells and the South Downs. </p> <p>\"It's a wonderful day - a spiritual moment,\" said Gwendoline Goddard, who previously used polite correspondence to achieve brief forays into the private wild uplands. </p> <p>Before yesterday's opening of the \"right to roam\" in regions designated the lower north-west and the south-east - the rest of Britain is to follow by the end of next year - she had to request permission from five landowners. </p> <p>The new law, which had its official welcoming ceremony in the Derbyshire Peak District, has turned the old order on its head. Yesterday's favourites on the walk to Alcomden were themselves landlords - Bob Baxter and Miles Foulger from Yorkshire Water. </p> <p>Once the strict custodian of reservoir catchments, the company now vies with the Ramblers' Association in its zeal for access. Standing in front of billboards saying \"Yorkshire Water - Committed to Access, Here to Help\", Mr Foulger said: \"This is only the beginning. </p> <p>\"Now we've got to work to get more people into these wonderful areas more easily.\" </p> <p>Modern water treatment systems have swept away old worries about trespassers peeing into moorland becks, much as the near-panic when the countryside was closed by foot-and-mouth transformed the majority of upland farmers' \"keep out\" attitude. </p> <p>Mr Foulger said: \"We've just finished 80 kilometres [50 miles] of new paths to access land, not just for walkers but for horseriders and, crucially, the disabled.\" </p> <p>One rambler famously not out for a walk was the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, who stayed away from the Derbyshire rally and an 8am launch in the Forest of Bowland to avoid attracting pro-hunting protesters. </p> <p>But there was no hostility towards the government at the rally in Haworth village before the walk - Anne Cryer, the local Labour MP, whose parents went on socialist summer camps during an earlier phase of the access campaign, got one of the biggest rounds of applause. \"I got engaged on a walk - from Aldermaston to London with CND. And I'm going to have to leave you early to go on another one.\" </p> <p>Her Tory neighbour David Curry had agreed to join a British Heart Foundation sponsored tramp along the Leeds-Liverpool canal, and to keep the red flag flying Ms Cryer could not turn down an invitation to go along too. </p> <p>Before she left she invoked another Yorkshire literary lion, JB Priestley, who described in his favourite novel, Bright Day, how the wilds were just a tuppenny bus ride away for toilers in the grime of Bradford's mills. </p> <p>The ramblers, however, were soon back with the Brontes, whose status as the vicar's daughters, rather than the law, got them past the gamekeepers. </p> <p>\"My sister Emily especially loved the moors,\" wrote Charlotte in 1850. \"She found in the bleak solitude many and dear delights; and not the least and best-loved was liberty.\"</p>",
  "The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, led fresh demands yesterday for Tony Blair to apologise for his handling of the Iraq war and its aftermath or risk having his reputation permanently tarnished by \"bad faith as well as bad judgment\". <p>Mr Kennedy seized on weekend disclosures of Whitehall papers confirming pre-war doubts about the consequences of the March 2003 invasion which has resulted in at least 10,000 Iraqi deaths and more than 1,000 among coalition forces. </p> <p>The documents from the Cabinet Office and Foreign Office suggest that in March 2002 Mr Blair was concerned primarily about regime change rather than, as he subsequently said, weapons of mass destruction. Invasion simply for regime change would have been contrary to international law. </p> <p>The Foreign Office yesterday acknowledged the documents were genuine but stressed they were only a snapshot of thinking at a particular time. Nor did they reflect the changes that took place over the following 12 months, in particular referring the issue to the UN, which the White House did at Mr Blair's behest, though it failed to get a second security council resolution authorising war. </p> <p>Mr Blair has consistently said publicly he supported President George Bush in the war because of the threat posed by Saddam's alleged WMD rather than because of a desire for regime change. </p> <p>But Sir David Manning, then Downing Street foreign policy adviser, now UK ambassador to Washington, discloses in one of the newly emerged documents, a memo on March 14 2002, that at the time the main issue for Mr Blair was regime change. </p> <p>He told Condoleezza Rice, Mr Bush's national security adviser: \"I said you [Blair] would not budge in your support for regime change but you had to manage a press, a parliament and a public opinion that was very different from anything in the States.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush was able to say publicly that he supported regime change but, for political and legal reasons, Mr Blair was constrained from following suit. </p> <p>The new papers came only days after remarks by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, that the war was illegal and before the report of the Iraq Survey Group on the failure to find WMD. </p> <p>The leaked documents, obtained by the Daily Telegraph, cover March 2002 when Mr Blair visited Mr Bush at his ranch near Crawford, Texas, to discuss possible war against Saddam. Speculation in Whitehall last night as to why they had been leaked ranged from a straight-forward theft for financial gain to a political motive to damage Mr Blair. </p> <p>Mr Bush, in a television interview at the time, said he had made his mind up that Saddam had to go. Until that point, the Foreign Office's advice to Mr Blair, set out in a paper on March 8 2002, was to stick with the policy of containment: keeping Saddam weak through sanctions and no-fly zones. But the paper concluded: \"The US has lost confidence in containment.\" </p> <p>The day after the Crawford meeting, Sir Christopher Meyer, then British ambassador to the US, met Paul Wolfowitz, the US deputy defence secretary. Sir Christopher, in a memo to Sir David, said he had stuck closely to the script set out by Sir David in his meeting with Ms Rice: \"We backed regime change but the plan had to be clever and failure was not an option.\" </p> <p>The plan set out by the Foreign Office and Downing Street was to go to the UN for a new resolution demanding unfettered access for weapons inspectors. If Saddam failed to cooperate, that would be a casus belli. </p> <p>A Foreign Office source said yesterday that war was not a predetermined outcome and that if Saddam had cooperated fully, war could have been avoided. \"Jack [Straw] was convinced that Bush was prepared to accept that,\" the source said.</p>",

Resisting outsiders only makes critics believe that the Sudan has something to hide.\"</p>",
  "<p>This October, the BBC is overseeing the launch of a new copyright licence. It is a small but necessary step towards realising one of the most visionary projects that the corporation has announced in decades - the Creative Archive. Although it may not seem obvious at first mention, the copyright licence, and the man behind it, show just how groundbreaking the archive promises to be. </p> <p>The Creative Archive will upload thousands of hours of archive BBC footage on to the internet to be watched again and reused by the public. As well as catering to curiosity-seekers eager to watch old footage from the 60s to the present day, the archive will provide students, teachers and amateur film-makers with a large body of material to reuse in non-commercial projects. </p> <p>The project exploits the BBC's position as a publicly funded broadcaster in a very clever way. Whereas most media organisations depend on controlling distribution of their products for their bread and butter income, the BBC has a charter obligation to make its products as free and accessible as possible. So while the majority of media companies continue to fret over internet piracy, the corporation can concentrate on getting involved in the broadband revolution. Peer-to-peer file-sharing will be central to the archive's distribution strategy. </p> <p>Paula Le Dieu, joint director of the project, wants the archive to become \"the fuel for creative endeavours in the UK\". She stresses the central ability to \"use the material in a way that the internet allows you to use digital assets\". But the UK copyright law has stood firmly in the way of such a resource up to now. This is because there has been no way for individuals or organisations to formally release works into the public domain the way the BBC proposes to do. Copyright law automatically grants \"all rights reserved\" to the author of a work, not just the right to commercially gain from the work, but the rights to distribution and to derivative works. </p> <p>When the BBC decided to release the Creative Archive for the British public to freely remix and reuse, therefore, it was presented with a significant legal challenge. Enter Lawrence Lessig, the Stanford law professor who last year asked the US supreme court to declare current copyright legislation unconstitutional. </p> <p>Lessig helped the corporation meet its legal challenge. It is his Creative Commons licence that the BBC has refashioned to get the archive off the ground. The history of this licence is embedded in a wider struggle against the current copyright system, and is Lessig's attempt to design some flexibility back into a system he believes will choke internet-enabled innovation. \"It is incredible that at a time when we have an unprecedented power to distribute ideas around the world, we have a growing body of restrictive intellectual property law that forbids us to do so,\" he says. </p> <p>Lessig first became interested in the public value of the internet when he noticed that, by letting anybody plug a computer into the ends of the network and instantly serve up their own opinions and media tools to the world, the net was fostering a new and expansive intellectual commons. This commons was producing rapid innovations, grassroots tools such as <a href=\"http://www.faxyourmp.com\">faxyourmp.com</a>, ambitious collaborative endeavours such as <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\">wikipedia.org</a>, Alexandrian archive projects like <a href=\"http://www.archive.org\">archive.org</a> and the many blogs which are starting to change our ideas about the independent press. </p> <p>Lessig's three books - Code, The Future of Ideas and Free Culture - chart the expanding body of intellectual property legislation that will choke this innovation. Any idea about fair use of copyrighted material, he argues, requires a prohibitively expensive team of lawyers to defend it. Valuable online archive projects are prevented from digitising 50-year-old films by the obligation to locate for themselves every last actor and ask permission first. The quasi-perpetual copyright terms lately secured in the US, and heading swiftly for the EU, are steering us towards a new feudalism that will stunt the growth of the knowledge economy. </p> <p>Lessig explains this idea: \"The fight against feudalism was the fight against property regimes that had become so expansive and cumbersome that they choked off innovation and competitive growth. Much of the progress of the common law in England was the process of limiting the burdens of property law, so that property could become something you could transfer - use, reuse, and the competitive market could take off. Now we've recreated feudalism in the context of intellectual property.\" </p> <p>Lessig is unequivocally not anti-copyright. Copyright law, he insists, must exist in a form which protects and incentivises creators. But it must also allow the eventual transference of ideas in order to promote progress. History teaches us, he argues, that when a new technology emerges that changes the way we transfer ideas; be it radio, film or cable TV, copyright law is re-examined. </p> <p>The Creative Commons licence was developed by Lessig and his team as a bottom-up approach to re-examining copyright law, after the top-down approach (his trip to the supreme court) failed. It manipulates existing law to create an environment of \"some rights reserved\", giving creators the power to take the feudal burdens out of the copyright system. Under Creative Commons, writers and artists choose which rights they want to keep, the exploitation of their work for commercial gain, say, while relinquishing other rights, for example, on distribution and derivative use. </p> <p>Free Culture was released under a Creative Commons licence: it can be accessed from Lessig's website. The Canadian science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, whose collection of short stories A Place So Foreign and Eight More recently beat Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake to claim the 2004 Sunburst award, releases his work under Creative Commons. Doctorow attributes his critical and commercial success to the swift dissemination of his works permitted by the internet. </p> <p>With the BBC now endorsing the ideas behind it, the profile of Creative Commons is likely to grow. Lessig, Le Dieu states, has been a \"terrific inspiration\". The Creative Archive is being seen as a \"core part of how the BBC wants to relate to audiences in the future\" and it is likely that Lessig's ideas will be receiving a lot more scrutiny in the UK. </p> <p>Lessig explains the modern apathy towards the public domain by evoking a \"Stalinist era of mass media, where we have become passive receptors of our own culture\" and stresses the need to get back to \"the idea of remixing [that] has been central to the creative process for much of the history of creativity\". A rebalanced copyright law, he argues, will ensure digital media owners can profit from works while simultaneously allowing these works to be subverted and expanded upon in the internet-driven public domain. </p> <p>The Creative Archive will show the commercial world what happens when these ideas are put into practice, and an external panel of commercial stakeholders has already been established at the BBC. Lessig believes the archive will \"drive economic development dramatically\". He likens it to the BBC's computer literacy project of the 1980s, which saw millions of BBC Micro computers distributed to Britain's schools. The Creative Archive upgrades the vision of digital literacy from code to content, and, Lessig insists, will not only \"drive demand for bandwidth, software and hardware tools in the UK to unprecedented levels\" but also create a new generation of savvy media consumers who \"instinctively understand how multimedia works\", putting the UK into pole position in the digital race. </p> <p>There are still significant barriers for the BBC to overcome, the most obvious of which is working with rights-holders outside the BBC (independent producers and actors commissioned by the BBC over its history) to include their work in the archive. Together with the release of the licence later this month a small, demonstrative selection of archive clips will be put online. </p> <p>The low-key release belies the emerging centrality of the Creative Archive to future BBC strategy since the change of leadership last spring. Under Greg Dyke, a bigger release had been planned, but, as Le Dieu puts it, \"we thought we were going to Brighton and now we're going to the moon, so we need to repack\". Lessig trusts the new direction to maintain the philosophy of Creative Commons: \"If you had asked me last year who would be the best man for the job, I would have pointed to Mark Thompson. When I put my ideas to him at Channel 4, he immediately got it: his next question was, right, how can we make this happen?\"</p>",

  "<p>More young people believe they suffer from discrimination in the workplace than older employees, a survey has found. </p> <p>While 48% of employees over 45 felt people of their age were being sidelined in the world of work, 58% of those aged between 16 and 24 felt they had been unfairly treated because of their age or lack of experience. </p> <p>The research by the law firm Eversheds revealed that people believed the workplace was rife with age discrimination, which will be banned by legislation due to come into force in October 2006. </p> <p>One in three employees surveyed claimed to be victims of age discrimination. </p> <p>Rather than being a sign of young people's high expectations, said Audrey Williams, a specialist in discrimination legislation at Eversheds, the younger employees' complaints illustrated how senior managers tended to think of age discrimination in terms of older workers. </p> <p>\"It is not surprising that young people are feeling most victimised,\" she said. \"Our research showed that nearly half of senior managers think that age discrimination only affects old people.\" </p> <p>The survey also found that only a fifth of companies have a ban on using age as a factor in recruitment. </p> <p>Under the new anti-discrimination law, job adverts using phrases such as \"experienced\", \"graduate\" or \"mature\" could be regarded as discriminatory, breaching the legislation. </p> <p>\"Currently, business is not ready for this legislation and organisations will have a significant hill to climb to ensure that they don't fall foul of the law,\" Mrs Williams said. </p> <p>Workers in Wales and the south-east were shown to be the most common victims of age discrimination. </p> <p>Eversheds' research also showed that three-quarters of employees did not want a compulsory retirement age.</p>",
  "<p>In <strong>Betrayed By New Labour</strong> (Channel 4, Sunday), Greg Dyke is hanging around Broadcasting House. \"Hiya, how are you?\" he says, matily, to the man working at the Ritazza coffee stall. \"Haven't seen you for a long time. I'm all right, can you get me a cappuccino please?\" </p> <p>Someone asks him if he still has his pass. \"Pass? They take your pass away within about 24 hours,\" he chuckles. \"They take your pass away, they turn off your computer terminal - well, specially if you leave under difficult circumstances.\" </p> <p>Then he wanders around the building a bit and goes into his old office. \"God, what a dump this is now! Quite literally. I spent four years of my life here, in this office. And look at it, it's a real tip.\" </p> <p>It all seems quite familiar. Is it a repeat? I check the listings. No, this is the first time this programme has gone out. So why am I getting this feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? </p> <p>And then suddenly it comes to me. It's The Office - one of those last, Christmas-special episodes, after David Brent has been deposed from his throne, though you wouldn't know it because he keeps on coming back in to chat to his old workmates and generally disrupt the place. Greg Dyke, it seems, has become David Brent. He's even on Channel 4. Will he be there at the Christmas party, I wonder? And if so, will he ask Mark Thompson to step out of the group photo, so it can just be the old gang, back together again? </p> <p>Greg, you come across as a thoroughly brilliant bloke. But I think most of us have sort of had it with Hutton now. We know that Saddam didn't have any WMDs that threatened us, that we went to war on a false premise, that it was extraordinary that Hutton didn't criticise the government, or Campbell, and that you should almost certainly still be in that office. We know all that, Greg. It's a disgrace, but you're not there, and you've got to accept that now, let it go. Who knows, there could be a job going at Wernham Hogg. </p> <p>There was a touch of David Brent about Alan, the character played by Mark Benton in <strong> King of Fridges</strong> (ITV1, Saturday). Alan is acting manager of Rocket, a fictional Comet-type store that sells hi-fis, kettles, sandwich toasters, white goods, that kind of thing. He wants to shake the place up a bit, make his mark while the boss is away. So he has a morning briefing for his staff (\"A morning what?\" they ask incredulously). Alan gets out a flip chart and introduces a snappy new acronym: SPAOFTYW. Which, obviously, stands for Smile, Personal Advice, 0 Percent Finance, Three Year Warranty. \"Spaoftyw,\" mumble his stuff, with difficulty. </p> <p>In spite of some funny moments and strong performances from Benton and Richard Wilson, who plays the old retrainee (or is he a spy?), this wasn't a classic drama. The plot felt a little forced. But it was worth it just for the opening scene. Alan kicks off the day alone in his store, with the shutters down. He puts Mr Blue Sky by ELO on one of the hi-fis, first on dance mode, then pop, before finally hitting the the subwoofer button. And he does a brilliant karaoke performance, remote control in hand, switching on the tellies as he sings and dances around the store. Wonderful. </p> <p><strong> Elgar's Enigma: A Hidden Portrait</strong> (BBC1, Sunday), Andrew Davis's dissection of the Enigma Variations, was great. My favourite bit was his explanation of the 11th variation, officially dedicated to George Robertson Sinclair, organist of Hereford Cathedral, but really about Dan. Dan was Sinclair's white-faced bulldog. </p> <p>Davis explains how Sinclair, Elgar and Dan were walking along the banks of the river Wye one day. Dan rushed down the slope into the water, swam a few yards upstream, leapt out again, then shook himself off with a joyful bark. \"Set that to music,\" Sinclair challenged Elgar. So he did. </p> <p>Then Davis demonstrates, with a piano, an orchestra, and some footage of a bulldog doing just what Dan did. Diddlediddlediddle-diddle: there he is tumbling down the bank. Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa: swimming upstream. Da dada da dada da dada da dada: climbing out. WOOF! </p> <p>No? Well, I think it's quite hard to do in words. Go and put the music on - it makes perfect sense, I promise.</p>",
  "<p>Capital Radio and GWR yesterday confirmed they are in talks over a \u00a3710m merger to create Britain's largest commercial radio group. </p> <p>The talks are at an advanced stage and the companies are expected to finalise terms on the nil-premium deal within a month. The combined group will bring together GWR's 33 analogue stations, including national broadcaster Classic FM, and Capital Radio's 21 analogue stations, including Capital FM - London's most popular radio station. </p> <p>Capital and GWR yesterday confirmed weekend press reports that months of on-off talks had produced a breakthrough. \"The boards of Capital and GWR note recent press speculation and confirm they are currently in discussions concerning the possibility of a nil-premium, all-share merger. </p> <p>\"These discussions are ongoing and may or may not lead to a transaction.\" </p> <p>Ralph Bernard, executive chairman of GWR, and David Mansfield, chief executive of Capital Radio, are expected to fill the same roles at the combined group. The combination of an executive chairman and chief executive is unusual, but sources close to the talks empasised that both executives have worked together over the past few years on a number of projects and industry bodies. </p> <p>The nil-premium status of the proposed deal reflects the high ratings of radio stocks, whose valuation has soared since the Communications Act relaxed restrictions on radio licence ownership this year. </p> <p>If the merger goes ahead, shareholders in both companies will effectively buy highly rated stock with highly rated stock. GWR's share price closed at 262.5p on Friday, giving the company a stock market capi talisation of \u00a3343m, and Capital closed at 430p, valuing the shares at \u00a3365m. Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, owner of 29.9% of GWR, will fold its shareholding into the new group. </p> <p>The combined company would have a workforce of 1,540. A merger would yield cost savings of \u00a37.3m-\u00a39m, or 3%-4% of combined annual sales, according to a research note published by UBS Warburg this year. </p> <p>Sources close to the talks said the companies did not expect the Competition Commission to scrutinise a deal made possible by changes to radio licence ownership rules introduced by the Communications Act this year. Trade secretary Patricia Hewitt will decide whether the merger will face a public interest inquiry from Ofcom, the media regulator. \"We think the merger is in the spirit of the act,\" said one source. </p> <p>If Capital and GWR agree terms the the Office of Fair Trading will examine the merger first before deciding whe ther it should be referred to the Competition Commission. </p> <p>The combined group would control 35% of the \u00a3540m radio advertising market, according to statistics published by Ofcom. Any regulatory inquiry is likely to focus on local radio advertising markets where Capital and GWR have a strong presence. Capital's biggest market is London, where it has an advertising revenue share of about 40% through Capital FM, Choice FM, Xfm and Capital Gold. GWR does not own a London licence but it clashes with Capital in the Midlands and the south coast, where both broadcasters own stations. The biggest concern is likely to be the east Midlands, where Capital owns 106 Century FM, which competes with GWR's Leicester Sound, Trent FM and Ram FM. Analysts predict that Century could be sacrificed if regulators object to Capital and GWR coming together in the east Midlands.</p>",
  "<p>William Donaldson, the chairman of the United States securities and exchange commission, said last night that senior US corporate executives - despite a wave of financial scandals - had failed to address the issue of boardroom pay being linked to performance. </p> <p>The US chief financial regulator was responding to critics of \"over-regulation\" and accused many American executives of still failing to provide \"ethical\" leadership for their companies. </p> <p>Mr Donaldson, in an interview with the Financial Times, said the lack of progress in linking boardroom pay more closely to performance showed that many were failing to give such leadership. </p> <p>\"The tone is set at the top,\" Mr Donaldson said. \"You must have an internal code of ethics that goes beyond the letter of the law to also encompass the spirit of the law. Does that spirit exist in all companies? No. All you have to do is look at executive compensation to recognise that we still have a way to go.\" </p> <p>His comments came as the US financial services firm, Citigroup, was absorbing the impact of a decision on Friday by Japanese regulators to close its private banking operation in Japan after what were described as \"serious violations\" of banking laws. </p> <p>Reacting to the Japanese regulator's move, Chuck Prince, Citigroup's chief executive, sent a memo to senior group management saying: \"We all must recognise that the success of our company requires each of us to maintain the highest standards of ethics.\" </p> <p>Mr Donaldson's remarks came amid a backlash against moves by a more pro-active SEC. The US Chamber of Commerce recently launched a legal action to overturn the SEC's ruling requiring mutual funds to have independent chairmen; Mr Donaldson also faces opposition to a plan to force all hedge funds to register with the SEC.</p>",
  "Perhaps it was the vintage British bulldog collars in Leeds Castle's dog collar museum that made Northern Ireland politicians uneasy. <p>But as Tony Blair appeared on the castle balcony in Kent this weekend to announce that the peace process could soon be rid of republican guns, nationalists said a deal to restore devolution had been scuppered by unionist attempts to strap a political \"choke lead\" around their necks. </p> <p>Thirty-four hours of talks over three days at the castle ended with two wedding parties and the arrest of a protester, but no agreement to see the 1.7 million people of Northern Ireland governed by their own polarised politicians rather than Westminster. </p> <p>Mr Blair said these were his last setpiece negotiations on Northern Ireland. He has pulled out of talks, leaving the parties and the Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, and his Irish counterpart to hammer out the outstanding issues this week. </p> <p>The talks roadshow returns to Stormont tomorrow, where the parties will continue to debate details of a once unthinkable arrangement in which Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party could sit down in government with Sinn F\u00e9in. Some believe a breakthrough is possible, with the governments suggesting difficulties will be ironed out by Christmas. </p> <p>Mr Blair said he knew better than to oversell the weekend's progress. But a significant IRA offer to disarm and end paramilitarism has the potential to break the deadlock on guns. </p> <p>The DUP will not move until the IRA stands down its army, puts its arsenal beyond use and severs all links with violence, and party leaders want a \"transparent\" act of decommissioning with a full inventory of weapons. </p> <p>Northern Ireland parties are now braced for the IRA to make a statement - possibly as early as this week - promising the end of the republican armed struggle and the decommissioning of guns. The IRA arms offer has not yet been set down in writing, but Mr Blair said it was \"reasonable in its substance and historic in its meaning\". </p> <p>The Ulster Unionist party, which pulled the plug on a deal last year over the issue of IRA guns, yesterday described the republican position as a \"seismic shift\". Mr Paisley earlier spoke of a \"golden opportunity,\" saying his party had \"never been closer to solving the problems that have plagued us for decades\". </p> <p>But the Sinn F\u00e9in chairman, Mitchel McLaughlin, sounded a note of caution, saying this week could see a \"build up of momentum\" or the whole thing could \"fray around the edges and fall apart as has happened before\". </p> <p>Unusually, it was not the guns question that hindered a deal this weekend but the form of government. </p> <p>The sticking point has been the DUP's insistence on changing the Good Friday agreement to reorganise the power-sharing Stormont executive and assembly along more traditional parliamentary lines. They want the executive to have more cabinet responsibility and seek to restrict the power of individual ministers, allowing the assembly to review ministers' decisions. </p> <p>The DUP is the largest party in the assembly, and nationalists see the changes as an attempt to seize control for unionism in a return to majority rule. Sinn F\u00e9in and the moderate nationalist SDLP say they will resist changes to the power-sharing balance. </p> <p>There is now a battle to find a deal that one side can say is exactly the same as the old Good Friday agreement, and the other side can say is completely rewritten. </p> <p>Back in Belfast the blame game has started. Sinn F\u00e9in said the DUP was not prepared to compromise. The DUP said it was not under pressure. The Presbyterian moderator, Ken Newell, said a great opportunity to close down the IRA completely had been missed by the DUP. </p> <p>There is another power game behind the negotiations. The DUP, which battered the Ulster Unionists in November's assembly elections, now hopes to decimate them at the next Westminster elections, cementing their control of unionism. Sinn F\u00e9in has similarly mortally wounded the SDLP . </p> <p>Both Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP know that, in the eyes of the electorate, they must not be seen to sell out in any deal.</p>",
  "A plan by the home secretary, David Blunkett, to establish processing camps outside of Europe to deal with asylum seekers has been revived after being taken up by the German and Italian governments. <p>Tunisia has been named by the German government as a possible site for the European Union camps, which will allow asylum seekers heading for Britain and the rest of Europe to apply for refugee status without having to pay people traffickers to smuggle them to London. </p> <p>Italy is funding camps in Tunisia to control the migrant flow from central Africa. </p> <p>The idea was first proposed by Mr Blunkett a year ago but met opposition from Otto Schilly, the German interior minister, who said it would increase rather than reduce the numbers trying to get into Europe. It was put on ice after Tony Blair failed to win support for it at the EU summit in Greece in June 2003. </p> <p>But appalled at the rising death toll amongst migrants who have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean, Mr Schilly has changed his mind. </p> <p>He has adopted the British plan, with the details to be thrashed out at a meeting of the G5 nations of Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain in Florence next month. </p> <p>\"The problems of Africa should be solved with the help of Europe in Africa, they cannot be solved in Europe,\" he told last month's meeting of European justice and home affairs ministers. </p> <p>The plan has also been backed by the EU's incoming \"justice, freedom and security\" commissioner, Rocco Buttiglione, from Italy. </p> <p>He has been Silvio Berlusconi's minister for Europe for three years, and said recently the EU was in danger of being \"swamped\" by an \"immigration time bomb\". </p> <p>Earlier this month Mr Buttiglione said: \"We have to ask transit countries to establish the camps that would take in immigrants who, for example, arrive from sub-Saharan Africa, to offer them humanitarian aid and information about job possibilities in Europe. </p> <p>\"But they would also investigate, identify and send back those who don't meet the criteria or who would not be able to integrate into our society.\" </p> <p>The move comes at a time when the EU is drawing up an asylum policy that could see a temporary resettlement scheme put in place for those in need of international protection. It would also include set targets for the numbers each country would take. </p> <p>British MEP Graham Watson, the leader of the Liberals in the European parliament, said they would oppose the project as he believed it ran counter to the European convention on human rights. \"If Mr Buttiglione chooses the road of confrontation he can expect a rocky ride,\" he said. </p> <p>A Home Office source said it welcomed the project being \"taken out of the icebox\" but wanted to see the detail of what is to be proposed at the Florence meeting. </p> <p>The original British plan insisted that the opening up of a new legal route to refugee status in Britain, through a camp based outside the EU's borders, would not replace the right to claim asylum for those who arrived in Britain.</p>",
  "<p>Law firms come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny operations in the high street to the massive City firms so big they have their own ecosystems. When it comes to choosing where to work, size is indeed important, but not always in the ways you might imagine.</p> <p>\"There's quite a difference between the mentality of a Magic Circle firm and a smaller firm,\" says Anna Wallbank, director of the legal temps department at recruitment consultancy Career Legal. \"With the Magic Circle, you'll be working for one specific partner and three or four other fee-earners, all specialising in one particular kind of work. At a smaller place, you'll be far more hands-on and probably doing a bit of everything.\"</p> <p>If you like being directly responsible for the smooth running of the firm, there is a lot to be said for work at the smaller end of the spectrum, where everyone is expected to take on tasks beyond the purely secretarial. But if you see such duties as frustrating interruptions, then a firm big enough to have entire departments designed to relieve you of extraneous matters could be very appealing.</p> <p>\"We get a huge amount of support,\" says Amanda Fairfield, a legal secretary in Freshfields' financial services and regulatory team. \"There are phone, fax and IT departments and a travel department, which will make all the arrangements for you. Then there's a general helpline for if anything else breaks or goes wrong. It leaves you free to concentrate on the job itself.\" </p> <p>While solicitors' hours at larger firms are notoriously long, their secretaries are generally protected from the worst excesses of client demands. Evening staff are brought in if late-night help is needed, and the largest firms have WP support teams working 24/7.</p> <p>At a high-street firm, it's more often a case of all hands to the pumps for as long as it takes for the workload to be cleared. The big boys also offer benefits and perks that are beyond the means of their smaller brethren. In-house gyms, season-ticket loans, private healthcare, on-site doctors and dentists, cash machines, drycleaners and subsidised shops and restaurants are commonplace. Some go even further - Baker Mackenzie, for example, have a five-star chef, formerly of the Ivy, feeding their fortunate employees.</p> <p>In the face of this, what can smaller firms possibly have to offer? \"A more family feel,\" says Anna Wallbank. \"It's a far less commercial environment and you can feel a lot more involved.\" Karen Watts, who worked for a high-street firm before moving to the in-house legal department of a huge City management consultancy, agrees.</p> <p>\"The high-street firm was friendly, relaxed, everyone knew everyone and you got more responsibility, which was great. At the other one, my boss found it hard to remember my name when he came back from a business trip. The staff were really competitive, there was no team spirit. You had to tell two people if you were going to the toilet. It was pathetic. I'm still scarred.\" </p> <p>Claire Emmersley too has fond memories of working for a small criminal law firm. \"The solicitors were really nice, even though things were often more hectic for them. And all the secretaries looked out for each other, too. The only downside was that if you were ill, you felt even worse for knowing everybody you were putting out.\"</p> <p>Watts and Emmersley now work for mid-sized City firms and are adamant that they have achieved the best of both worlds. \"It's big enough not to be cliquey but small enough still to be friendly,\" says Watts, a sentiment which Emmersley echoes. \"You're a bit more of 'just a number' of course,\" she says. \"But you still get to know everybody and I wanted to get into the City but was too young and quiet to cope with a really big firm.\" She adds that although she doesn't get any perks, her basic salary compares very favourably with her friends who have gone down that route.</p> <p>So - would you prefer anonymity coupled with an avalanche of emoluments, or to be a known face in a slightly less well-off crowd? It seems that in the legal, as in the fashion world, one size does not fit all.</p>",
  "<p>Alan Milburn is restored to us after walking into the political wilderness to spend more time with his family. Whether his return is due to the fact that family life turned out to be duller than he remembered, or that the zeal of his public spirit proved impossible to extinguish, it has brought the question of life/work balance to the top of the agenda. </p> <p>Milburn's cabinet colleagues do not share his enthusiasm for work/life balance in practice (to say the least) but they think it is good idea for other people. One argument is that it is an equal opportunities issue: only when fathers play a bigger role at home will women be free to advance at work. This turns out to be a very male assumption, because, according to a survey of managers conducted by the Institute of Leadership and Management (ILM) women managers see the obstacles they face at work as having nothing to do with their home life. Half of the women surveyed believed that the biggest obstacle to promotion they face is naked prejudice or \"stereotyping\" to use the polite term the ILM favours. Only a fifth of women cited work/life balance as their chief problem. </p> <p>The same survey shows that the views of men and women managers are as askew as ever and that it is not true that, give or take a school run here or there, equal opportunity in the office is a dead issue. When asked whether having more women in senior management positions would improve their organisations, 83% of women said yes, and 51% of men said no. It should also be remembered that policies or even legislation do not necessarily change behaviour. The Scandinavian countries are often cited as examplary for leading the way in offering parental leave to parents of both sexes. It is not an example that individual Scandinavians follow themselves. In Norway, which has had the most generous parental leave in the world for years, only about a fifth of fathers take advantage of it - a similar proportion to British fathers. There is no reason to suppose that this proportion will grow.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Sometimes time-wasting can get out of hand. You get to work, and fire off a quick email to your best friend. She bats one back, appending some juicy gossip. You reply, demanding more detail, then turn your attention to the other, work-related, emails in your inbox. Only, just as you start, your friend responds. Try as you might to keep your mind on that invoice from the stationery company, her email beams irresistibly at you. On the other hand, if she doesn't respond for an unusually long time, you begin to wonder whether you might have said something to offend her. If you let it, this conversation can take up hours of your day - which is only sometimes desirable. </p> <p>Many of us are now all too aware of how email can take over our lives. I used to think email was quicker than the phone: no halting introduction, just straight down to business. But when emails start arriving in earnest, it's as much as you can do to keep up. You send a reply which you hope is a firm and unequivocal no: before you know it, another one pops up two minutes later, thanking you for your reply. What we need is a signal that this is the last email in the current exchange, a polite but firm, \"That's all, folks!\" In fact, we need to address the whole area of email etiquette. Now that email is our main form of communication, the laid-back, faux-intimate style that accompanied the explosion of e-culture needs an injection of formality. </p> <p>Two surveys have addressed aspects of email anxiety. One, commissioned by the smart phone developers palmOne, found that thousands are jeopardising their business relationships by sending sloppy, grammatically incorrect, or inappropriately jocular mail (yes, you, the one who carefully inserts spelling mistakes to make it look as though you only spent 0.04 seconds on this one). Most of us have discovered how perilously easy it is to flirt insincerely by email, only to find ourselves embarrassingly stuck for words in person. And many of us have sweated over an ill-judged, light-hearted comment sent without proper consideration, open to all kinds of misconstruction. Unfortunately, ignoring your in-tray won't get you out of this minefield unscathed. According to the survey, the thing that makes people most furious is when others deny they received an email at all. </p> <p>Rather than making our lives lighter and quicker, email has become a a burden. People are apparently incapable of deleting emails - men more so than women, each hoarding an average 444 emails. </p> <p>Another survey, by Xerox, has a number of suggestions to save you from your importunate inbox, and help you avoid causing offence amongst your e-correspondents. </p> <ul> <li> Be clear, check your spelling, and re-read the email before you send it to make sure there is no ambiguity or innuendo. <ul> <li> Don't make jokes unless the recipient knows you very well - and even then, resist the temptation if at all possible. </li> </ul> <ul> <li> Remember not to use the Reply to All button, it could be very embarrassing. </li> </ul> <ul> <li> Don't reply in haste: if you receive an email that irritates you, leave it for a while, then re-read at leisure. You may have misconstrued its tone or meaning (the same goes for emails that thrill you: make sure you haven't read too much into it before you say what you really think). </li> </ul> <ul> <li> Use the telephone. </li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> \"Women are not a niche market nor are they a new market. They are the market.\" </p> <p>So says Peter Frost, managing director of marketing consultancy Proficiency. \"Women want 'productivity' solutions, ie time, money and space-saving ideas. And what is clear is that most manufacturers simply haven't looked at it that way before.\" </p> <p>It is fascinating to note in 2004 that marketing to women is still an entirely new concept in some areas. Apparently it has only recently emerged that the individuals who buy stationery for offices are overwhelmingly female. And these women, take note, love choosing stationery. They love it. It's their favourite thing. The brighter the better. Give a girl a choice of aquamarine thick weave or pastel pink card and she's happy for hours. Offer her yellow folders and orange dividers, oh, you won't hear a cross word for a week. Tell her she can have it in grey, that's a different story. Women who purchase dull, monochrome office equipment are liable to feel no one cares about them. So remember: sell her everything in pink, pure office nirvana; patronise her with your patter, you can forget it.</p>",
  "<p>Hailed by some as the future of television, and by others as the end of programme quality, advertiser-funded TV production is experiencing a boost from an unlikely source: central government. </p> <p>COI Communications, the executive agency that advises government departments and related agencies on how best to spend their marketing money, has developed In Good Company, a four-part series that will air on ITV1 in peaktime from next Thursday. It is the fourth COI-backed TV series on British television in recent months. The format may sound familiar - four struggling businesses are teamed with well-known business mentors who assess how they could do better - but the programme's evolution is a model that a growing number of advertisers now hope to emulate. In Good Company was conceived and paid for by Investors in People (IiP) to spread its message - that business success comes from investing in people. </p> <p>Working with the COI, IiP approached the media specialist Drum and the production company Enteraction TV to create the programme format. This was then offered to and accepted by ITV. In return for funding and developing the series, IiP will be credited within the programme titles and use the programme as the centrepiece of a promotional campaign. \"We considered broadcast sponsorship and conventional TV advertising but they were either too costly or unable to deliver the message we needed to convey,\" IiP's director of marketing Nicola Maine explains. </p> <p>Another significant public sector funder of TV programmes is the National Blood Service. It paid for and conceived Blood Matters, a factual series about blood donation among different ethnic groups which has just aired on Channel 4. And it was also behind two daytime factual series, Lifeblood and Extra Time, both of which recently went out on Five. </p> <p>For advocates of advertiser-funded TV programmes (AFP), the COI's apparent commitment is a welcome sign. \"TV programmes influence how we think and feel,\" says Chris Harrison, managing director of Spring London, the brand content division of the ad agency Leo Burnett which last year developed the Heinz-funded cookery series Dinner Doctors for Five. \"As significant numbers of consumers turn away from conventional advertising, advertisers are starting to consider programme-making. The COI's interest proves programming can be an ideal vehicle for communicating their messages.\" </p> <p>But growing interest in AFP also poses a thorny issue for the industry regulator Ofcom, which is currently reviewing commercial broadcast guidelines on advertising and sponsorship: just how much direct advertiser involvement in TV programming is a good thing? </p> <p>In a literal sense, all commercial TV programmes are advertiser-funded - paid for by broadcast production budgets funded through TV advertising sales. AFP, however, involves an advertiser directly funding the development and production of a programme. By footing the bill the advertiser has an involvement from the outset in programme development and, in many cases, an opportunity to retain control over certain programme rights, enabling it to share in revenue from programme sales or related off-air activities. </p> <p>Under current Ofcom regulations, advertisers cannot directly promote themselves or their products within the content of a programme. But they can help develop content that indirectly endorses a brand message and enjoy on-air credits within that programme's title sequence. And despite the fact that many AFP exponents claim existing rules are too restrictive, a growing number of advertisers are taking AFP very seriously indeed. </p> <p>Take mobile phone company Orange. It has just funded Orange Playlist - a cross between a chart show and Desert Island Discs, featuring celebrities' favourite tracks, popular culture, ringtone and download charts. The show starts on ITV this Thursday and will run for 26 weeks across ITV1, ITV2 and VH1. Orange will use it as the focus for a major multimedia campaign. Its aim? To reflect and advance \"downloading culture\", Cody Hogarth, head of commercial partnerships at the programme's production company, Initial, explains. </p> <p>According to figures from the Branded Content Marketing Association (BCMA), the number of AFPs airing on British TV will more than double this year. In 2003, 36 went out on the UK's 10 largest commercial channels including the Nokia-funded reality show Fashion House on Channel 4; Red Bull Soapbox Challenge and With a Little Help from My Friends, a BT-backed show, both on ITV. The BCMA predicts investment in AFP by advertisers will rise from \u00a35m in 2003 to \u00a322m this year. </p> <p>When you consider UK advertisers spent around \u00a34bn on TV advertising in 2003, and a further \u00a3100m on TV sponsorship, AFP is a drop in the ocean, of course. However, a growing number of advertisers, agencies, programme-makers and broadcasters now acknowledge AFP as a legitimate way for TV programmes to be produced - with certain caveats. </p> <p>\"In theory, it sounds like a universal panacea for brand owners, but many stumbling blocks exist - not least making a good programme we would want to broadcast and our viewers would want to watch,\" says David Charlesworth, head of sponsorship at Channel 4, which recently aired Fit Street, a reality health show paid for by Flora. But, he adds, if a programme is something the channel wants, it will take it whether it is advertiser-funded or not. </p> <p>\"Increasingly, there's less money available to spend on certain slots in the schedule - shoulder peak, late night, and so on,\" says Simon Wells, head of commercial development at Enteraction TV. \"If we deliver a \u00a330,000 show at a fraction of that cost for the broadcaster they can plough the money they would have spent into primetime. Where's the problem with that?\" The challenge, he adds, is to get more channels to admit to doing it. </p> <p>\"Many broadcasters don't like to discuss it - which is holding it back. One reason is because of all the backroom deals that are done. Many AFPs are licensed to a broadcaster for a nominal \u00a31 in a deal also including commercial airtime for the advertiser funder. Where the advertiser retains rights in the show it can get an airing or two on a mainstream channel then repeat broadcasts on digital,\" Wells says. \"But not openly discussing all this suggests there's something underhand about it, which there isn't.\" </p> <p>For some broadcasters, though, AFP remains a type of programming to disdain. \"It's just not a terrestrial TV issue,\" insists one source. \"Quality hurdles for us are higher. Without Nigel Pickard, Kevin Lygo or Dan Chambers agreeing an AFP format that will at least deliver equivalent share to what was in a particular slot before, we just won't get involved. And I can't see that happening. Why would an advertiser have a better idea than a TV producer or commissioning editor?\" </p> <p>Others believe, however, that this argument misses the point. Larger production companies including Endemol, TV Corp and Fremantle are actively courting advertisers to help underwrite production budgets. A growing number of ad agencies now employ \"brand content\" specialists. Others are assessing ways in which advertisers could become programme distributors. Audi, for one, is considering launching its own TV channel. In the US, the cereals giant General Mills now invests in producing straight-to-DVD entertainment to distribute direct to consumers on the back of cereal packets. </p> <p>As for whether greater advertiser involvement in TV production is a good thing, well, many dismiss this as a bogus concern. \"We will see a lot more AFP in the future,\" Initial's Hogarth readily predicts. \"But I can't envisage a time when we would see vulgar programmes on major channels simply because an advertiser has paid for them to be there. It just won't happen.\" Time will tell.</p>",
  "Greg Dyke is in danger of becoming a bore. Eight months after resigning as director general of the BBC, his family has kindly requested that he stops talking about it. He has a memoir about to be published, Inside Story, a quarter of which he devotes to the Hutton inquiry. He has made a television programme on the subject. Dignified silence, he says, flinging an arm over the back of his chair and grinning luridly, is \"not in my nature\". We are in the library of a London hotel, where, over the course of two hours, Dyke will call the BBC governors \"silly bastards\", the government's reasons for going to war \"garbage\", the intelligence service \"prats\", and Lord Hutton a \"joke figure\". He shines with cosmic indignation. <p>His partner Sue, meanwhile, has had enough. </p> <p>\"Sue says I'm obsessed with him,\" says Dyke, ruefully, in a quieter moment. </p> <p>With who? </p> <p>He whispers,\" Blair .\" </p> <p>*** </p> <p>When Dyke ran the BBC, someone once sent out a company-wide email in his name. He went berserk. \"I went bloody mad. I said, 'Listen: I do my emails, I write them, they're not long, they're not turgid. And they say something.'\" He always signed them, \"Greg\". </p> <p>He has a lust for life that reminds me of Rigsby's unbridled enthusiasm for Miss Jones: it is barely contained within his borders. Dyke's speech is reiterative. \"Well, hang on,\" he'll say, or, \"the thing is\", as if correcting a small but key misapprehension; it gives his blandest statement an air of spirited defence. When he joined the BBC in 2000, he did lots of hammy things to show up his predecessor, John Birt: eating with staff in the canteen, touring regional BBC offices that hadn't been visited by the boss for decades (\"I mean, no one had been to Norwich for 20 years\"), and generally drawing on his background - failed exams, delayed entry into university, bouts of unemployment, then sudden and late-breaking success - to advertise himself as a regular human being. He was Ernie to Birt's Bert: cuddly and approachable to his predecessor's reputation as a bit of a stiff. </p> <p>\"That's how you buy credibility,\" says Dyke. \"Sometimes it can be quite calculated. But it shows that you care.\" </p> <p>When Andrew Gilligan made his fateful broadcast at 6.07am on May 29 last year, Dyke was on holiday. In it, Gilligan drew on David Kelly's testimony to report that the government had \"sexed-up\" the dossier arguing for war with evidence it knew to be \"questionable\". What followed has become almost mythical in the retelling. A man died; a collision course was set between Dyke and Blair which, for sheer drama, echoed lines by Thomas Hardy on the iceberg meeting the Titanic: \"Alien they seemed to be / No mortal eye could see / The intimate welding of their later history.\" </p> <p>Even Dyke's appeal to ancient Greece - he believes that the destiny of those involved lay to some extent in their characters - does not, under the circumstances, seem overblown. It has been said that if Birt had been in charge, things would have been different; that when Alastair Campbell sent his first, furious letter of complaint a week after the broadcast, Birt would simply have bureaucratised him into the ground. Dyke, however, doesn't like to be bullied. He likes to win. When he was fired from TVam, for example, he was part of GMTV's successful franchise bid to snatch the licence from under the people who had screwed him. When the company eventually folded, he reacted with the words: \"Game, set and match.\" </p> <p>Dyke also has pots of what he calls \"fuck-off\" money, a fortune made when he sold his shares in LWT. \"It is no coincidence,\" he says, \"that the only two people who left the BBC were the two who didn't have to pay off a mortgage.\" (The other was Gavyn Davies, chairman of the BBC board of governors.) He admits that being wealthy has encouraged a \"risk-taking\" style of management. Dyke's response to Campbell, therefore, was to give him the finger. In a move that, if they didn't already love him, would endear him forever to BBC staff, he authorised the head of news, Richard Sambrook, to fire back a letter defending Gilligan to the hilt. When Campbell's second letter came in, he referred him aggressively to the BBC's official complaints procedure. </p> <p>\"Well, you know what would've happened with John Birt,\" says Dyke. \"He was in and out of Downing Street all the time. I mean, John Birt phoned up loads of people during the whole thing, saying, 'This story isn't true.' When you asked him how he knew it wasn't true, [he'd say] 'Because I know the people in Downing Street and they all tell me it's not true.'\" </p> <p>Why would he do that? </p> <p>\"Well, because he's one of them.\" </p> <p>But for the sake of the BBC, surely - </p> <p>\"No, no,\" says Dyke, and lowers his voice. \"John is interested in John.\" </p> <p>The Butler inquiry, which followed on from Hutton, vindicated both Kelly's and Gilligan's assertion that intelligence in the dossier was flawed. Or, as Dyke puts it, \"We were right, they were wrong.\" But Butler didn't directly blame Blair for this, and Gilligan's mistake in saying the government \"ordered\" intelligence it knew to be dodgy into the dossier still stands uncor rected. As mistakes go, said Mark Byford, Dyke's deputy at the time, it \"wasn't minor\". </p> <p>Dyke splutters. \"Well, without being rude, Mark Byford knew nothing about it at all. There were mistakes; the story should've been put to Downing Street - not that it would've made any difference. And he [Gilligan] made a mistake in the use of the word 'ordered' - that they 'ordered' more facts to be put in. They didn't order more. But the point is that in the last 12 days, two pieces of intelligence came in which transformed the whole document and were later withdrawn. We went to war on the basis of a set of crappy intelligence reports that someone within government knew was nonsense. Now, that is pretty serious stuff.\" </p> <p>Of course, Dyke says, he could have done things differently. He could, for example, have reacted to that initial complaint by stalling Campbell; he could have launched an investigation into the broadcast that dragged on until the story went cold. But \"those things are easy to do in hindsight. Not that I think it would have made any difference.\" Once Kelly's name came out, he believes, the chain of events was unstoppable. If there was a moment when the whole thing could have been averted, it was far earlier, before Gilligan even made the broadcast. It was when Blair sent Dyke a letter complaining that the BBC's coverage of the war was slanted. </p> <p>\"I got the letter from Blair himself, which was a clear attempt to influence the independence of the BBC. You've got to understand that the BBC is the only true independent; all the rest of them would've done a deal.\" He looks pained. There is a line of thought that doing a deal at this point would have been relatively easy. Dyke could have gone to Downing Street, made a few conciliatory noises and smoothed things over. \"And there's probably\", he says, \"a bit of me that is flawed there.\" He looks downcast. \"You know what I mean? That actually, should I have just said, you know ... ?\" He trails off, then cheers up again. \"Oddly, Gavyn and I both felt the same way, that they shouldn't be doing this.\" And he clicks back into attack mode. </p> <p>Although careful not to accuse him of lying, in unguarded moments, Dyke has been known to rail against Blair for being \"corrupt\". I ask him if he still thinks this is so. \"I wouldn't say that Blair is corrupt. That's much too simple. It's on his conscience whether he should still be prime minister. I think Campbell was out of control and Blair couldn't control him.\" </p> <p>Dyke isn't one for brooding. But he would urge those who are, to return to a particular moment in the inquiry and relive it with relish. \"Go back to what the prime minister said to Hutton: 'If any of this had been true, I'd have had to resign.' Well, we now know most of it was true, Mr Blair. So why are you still in office?\" </p> <p>Dyke has told his children that the purpose of life is to have fun; to accrue good memories. When his eldest son was in his final year at university, he came to his father for advice. He wanted to go to the Manchester United match in Barcelona, but was worried it would interfere with his finals exams. Dyke said: \"Matthew, let me tell you something about the reality of life. When you're 30, nobody gives a toss about whether you got a 2:1, a 2:2 or a first. But if you can say you were in Barcelona the night Manchester United won the Champions League, now that matters. That's the sort of house that I was brought up in; winning in football was much more important than passing your exams.\" </p> <p>Dyke grew up in the suburbs of Middlesex. His dad sold insurance. After leaving school with one E in maths at A-level, he won a place on a Marks &amp; Spencer management trainee scheme (Watford branch). He was fired after four months. Then he worked in local journalism, before doing a degree in politics at the University of York (later this year he will become chancellor). When he referred in his book to Cherie Blair asking him for a discount on a Manchester United shirt, it was assumed he was being deliberately mischievous. But Dyke said he approved of her request; he too was brought up not to waste money; he still shops in the sales. </p> <p>In 1977, he stood as a Labour party candidate in the GLC elections and lost. Much of the drama of his battle with Blair derived from the fact that Dyke is a Labour stalwart, a millionaire who sent his kids to the local state school. At the age of 30, however, he was unemployed and depressed. Then he got his break in television as a researcher at LWT, and with amazing rapidity was five years later editor-in-chief of TVam. Through sheer cheek and hard work, he entirely bypassed middle management. \"It was grrrreaat !\" he says. \"Ha ha! I never had to worry about the bloody holiday roster.\" </p> <p>There followed the fun years. Dyke has told the stories of what happened to him at TVam so many times that when he was writing his memoir, he had to check which were true. \"There was the day we discovered that the bloke who played Roland Rat ran a club where you could get whipped on a Friday night. And that was the whole place. It was a black comedy. I made more friends there than anywhere else in my life. And yet out of it, those who survived were bound to succeed, because once you'd lived through that, everything else was easy. What I discovered from it is that most people hate crisis and I quite like it.\" </p> <p>The skills Dyke took with him from TVam, and later LWT, to the BBC, were not immediately transferable. When he arrived at the corporation, he says, it was a place that \"didn't know how to have fun\". There was a lot of sycophancy. He expected it to be full of public school people, but actually, he says, they were \"mostly grammar school\". Dyke is the third child in his family, and he characterised the staff at the BBC as being made up of \"too many first children: overachieving, but who take themselves too seriously\". </p> <p>If Birt had tried to implement some of the wacky management ideas favoured by Dyke, he would have been laughed out of town. But people bought it from Dyke because they liked him. His fabulous indiscretion made him popular at parties. He did cheesy (the Cut the Crap cards), and he did schmaltzy: getting people to come into a room and celebrate their career highs with their managers. It was called Just Imagine. Embittered old hacks apparently wept. Then there were the country-dancing team-building weekends. \"The point is you want people to like each other. You don't want a management team that is scared to death of the bloody boss.\" </p> <p>When Hutton ruled so damningly against the BBC, Dyke assumed the governors would back him. He is by nature an optimist. He is also largely unaccustomed to losing. Recounting what actually happened, he looks freshly gobsmacked. \"On the day that I left, it had never crossed my mind that these silly bastards would respond in this way. Never crossed my mind.\" If he had been from posher stock, he believes the governors would have supported him. He says this quite cheerfully; there is a romance to being on the outside that Dyke can't resist. </p> <p>What saved him from misery in the days after, was the spontaneous outpouring of support from BBC staff, who massed before the cameras to cheer him as he left. That evening he went straight home to Sue and they had dinner at the house of old friends, Lynn Faulds Wood and John Stapleton. \"There was a strange high,\" he says, \"because, although Hutton was garbage, the speed at which the public rejected it was really very interesting. We couldn't believe that it would happen that fast.\" </p> <p>I ask how he thinks his successor is doing. The week Dyke and I meet, Mark Thompson is in the news having failed to quash rumours that there will be job cuts at the BBC. Dyke is surprisingly critical. While he understands that it's all a game played around charter renewal time, he finds Thompson's response \"depressing. I'm unnerved about some of the things that have been happening in terms of the staff. I'd hate to think that they're going to lose that relationship that we built.\" </p> <p>Does he think that's possible? </p> <p>\"Well, when I hear them say, 'Oh, we're going to have to sack loads of people,' I mean, the whole place must be unnerved. You don't announce that you might get rid of people, because they all sit there destabilised. I think it's a mistake. That's not a great way of running a place.\" </p> <p>He has other worries, too. Dyke says he can see the autonomy he gave his staff being eroded. \"I'd say, 'There's the money, go and sort your bit out.' And suddenly they're not getting that any more. Suddenly they're getting checks and things. That kills people.\" </p> <p>After the Butler report came out, he says the new administration at the BBC made a serious error; they should have capitalised on it by issuing a bolshie statement along the lines of, \"Admit it, we were right.\" \"As a new chairman and a new director general, you'd rather not be involved, wouldn't you? I mean, to be honest. But I don't think that's an option. I think at some stage they've got to come out. The longer they stay quiet, the worse it gets.\" </p> <p>So the culture revolution he led at the BBC is not irreversible? He allows himself a martyrish look. \"No,\" he whispers. \"I wasn't there long enough.\" </p> <p>*** </p> <p>Dyke has undoubtedly mellowed. At the age of 57, he says, he has handled the Hutton affair much more philosophically than he dealt with leaving LWT after its hostile takeover. That, he says, was like \"suffering a fatality\". Now, he is more relaxed. He employs his own chauffeur and PA, so still has the VIP trappings that feed into his identity (\"It's a bloke thing\"). More surprising is his relatively relaxed attitude to Rupert Murdoch. Not long ago, Dyke was frequently vituperative on the subject of the relationship of the Blair government to Murdoch. He says it is no better than that of the Conservative party under Thatcher. \"They all believe they can't win unless they've got Murdoch on side. They are politically scared.\" He tells the story of the pressure put by Murdoch on board members of Manchester United, one of them Dyke, during BSkyB's attempted takeover of the club. \"One of the only people on our side were our brokers, Merrill Lynch. And I got a call from the guy at Merrill Lynch halfway through the night. 'I'm in trouble', he said, 'I've just had a call from my bosses in the States who've said that Fox [a Murdoch company] have been on the phone saying if you don't stop supporting me [Dyke] you'll lose your share of the flotation of Fox.' That's the way they work. Sinister stuff. And politicians are a game in it now.\" </p> <p>And yet despite all this, Dyke has decided to publish his book, a chapter of which outlines his criticisms of the media mogul, with HarperCollins, a Murdoch-owned publisher. Why? </p> <p>\"If they'd tried to make any changes, I'd have pulled it. I genuinely thought it would be quite fun to see whether you could get it in. And there's been absolutely nil interference.\" </p> <p>The low points in Dyke's life have been relatively few; he thinks of himself as lucky. \"I mean, I buggered up a marriage in the process of it. There are things that you ...\" He pauses. \"I mean, my dad died, and I wasn't there, I wasn't there because I went to a fucking meeting. I can never forgive myself for it. And those sorts of things are ... but I've never ... I mean, this is a failure, I suppose. Except all the staff took to the streets and I came out a hero!\" </p> <p>On the day that he left the BBC, Dyke received 6,000 emails. When he sent them to be bound, the man at the shop wouldn't charge him for it. \"Oh, I can't read them. They upset me. I can't. They are very ...\" His voice cracks. \"They're very upsetting.\" Then he brightens. \"Except for the one that says, 'Fuck off, I never liked you anyway'.\" He looks more pleased about that than anything. </p> <p>For the while, Dyke says, not very convincingly, he's happy pottering about his many homes, doing the lawn. After making the documentary for Channel 4, he says he wouldn't mind doing more on-screen presenting, although his teenage daughter said after watching it: \"You're a bloody crap presenter. Don't make any more.\" He says he has been offered \"loads of chairmanships, but they're all boring\". Dyke has never held a job for longer than four years; he only does things he finds difficult. </p> <p>There are politicians he admires: Blunkett, David Davies, Peter Hain. He liked John Major. He thinks Tessa Jowell started off shakily but has \"got a lot better\". </p> <p>Sue has told him to make up with Blair. \"She said, 'Fuck it, sit down and talk to him.' I think he's probably fundamentally quite a decent bloke, although I do think there is a zealotry about him.\" Blair appears willing. He has invited Dyke to see him. But Dyke won't. He can't. It's not in his nature. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Inside Story by Greg Dyke is published by HarperCollins at \u00a310.99. To order a copy with free p&amp;p, call Guardian Book Service on 0870 836 0875.

  "<p>Early last Wednesday morning a group of casually dressed people gathered tensely on the third floor of BBC Television Centre. For a journalist trying to gauge the power of television schedulers - the people who decide when programmes should go out and where - there was no better place to be. </p> <p>Forty-eight hours earlier, Liam Keelan, the scheduler of BBC1, had spotted a big problem. He had finally been able to watch finished episodes of BBC1's prestigious British Isles - A Natural History, presented by Alan Titchmarsh, a show that was already being heavily promoted to viewers. But, he suddenly realised, the eight-part series was too demanding for the 8pm slot that it had been allocated for next Wednesday (29 September). \"It's a sit down and concentrate series,\" he said. He decided it would have to switch from 8pm to 9pm, and informed BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey. </p> <p>This one change, however, had a major knock-on effect on BBC2, BBC3 and BBC4, which try to run complementary programmes. To accommodate British Isles, Keelan decided to switch What Not To Wear (previously on BBC2 but now showing on BBC1) from 9pm to 8pm, causing major disruption for BBC2, which had scheduled Who Rules the Roost?, a programme on parenting, for 8pm. This meant two shows with similar (female) audiences airing simultaneously. Clearly this was an impossibility. </p> <p>So on Wednesday morning, with a cut-off deadline of 2.30pm looming - after which it would be impossible to make further changes - George Dixon, the BBC2 scheduler, pulled forward the start of Challenge - a series for men about major explorations. The schedule made sense again. </p> <p>So why the deadline? Well, it is all part of the scheduling game. Every Friday afternoon, the main broadcasters are required by law to publish and exchange their (draft) schedules for two weeks ahead. As part of the elaborate mixture of skulduggery and bluffing that goes on, there are always some gaps, marked TBA - to be announced. The schedulers then have until 2.30pm the following Wednesday to make final changes to avoid clashes, so the television listings magazines can hit their deadlines - hence the tense group I witnessed. </p> <p>There was also tension across town last Wednesday at Channel 4, where its scheduler, Jules Oldroyd, was at action stations. Oldroyd was shocked by the appearance of The Farm, Five's new nightly reality show, which launches next Sunday at 10pm. \"If it takes off, it's a real bugger\" and a commercial blow, said her boss Rosemary Newall, controller of broadcasting and scheduling. </p> <p>The Farm is made by Endemol, of Big Brother fame. So for grimly commercial competitive reasons, Channel 4 decided to slip in the film Gladiator, which runs for three and half hours, at 9pm. Oldroyd also moved Ali G in America to 11.30pm on Friday and before it put in an hour of The Osbournes instead of the scheduled half hour. This is a temporary measure that prepares the way for changes to be announced this Friday. Oldroyd decided that Channel 4 needed an hour long \"recut\" of its new talent show, Kings of Comedy. Endemol duly drafted in a new team. This is expected to bolster C4's \"Friday is entertainment night\" theme against Jonathan Ross on BBC1 - a show coveted by all schedulers. </p> <p>At ITV, by contrast, things were calm. Seasoned scheduler David Bergg had made changes the previous week to reinstate The Bill at 8pm on Wednesday and move Coronation Street Family Albums - which his rivals all gleefully pointed out to me had not worked - to 10pm. And the opposition have decided Steel River Blues also isn't working. But Bergg was thrilled that the one-off Alan Plater drama Belonging, starring Brenda Blethyn, had worked so well. </p> <p>Behind the scenes at every television channel there is a small bunch of anonymous yet powerful people, typically in their 30s or early 40s, who draw up schedules. On their computers are stored precious trade secrets, mapping schedules three years ahead. They spend their time worrying simultaneously about 2006/7 and what's going out that night. They constantly ask questions such as \"When is the next I'm A Celebrity starting?\" And at 9.45 each morning, when the \"overnights\" - Barb audience data - are released, they will all be glued to their computers. </p> <p>Not one of them has ever made a programme (see panel): most trained in audience research, or media/ sales. Being a programme-maker is regarded as a positive disadvantage because detachment is all. They are fiercely competitive and watch each other and their schedules like hawks. </p> <p>Adam MacDonald, who scheduled BBC2 and BBC1 before making a (rare) switch to commissioning, becoming controller of Channel 4 daytime, says: \"You have to know and love telly. You have to stare at spreadsheets all day and see TV in them, understand how audiences behave. You're not a programme-maker, but you need a good editorial head.\" Schedulers are also political. \"It sounds a bit cynical,\" says MacDonald, \"but you also schedule with an eye to what will get good reviews.\" </p> <p>An occupational hazard for all of them is that many television programmes - dramas and documentaries in particular - don't match expectations. They may not do what they say on the can. They may even be untransmittable. Apart from such staples as soaps, Richard &amp; Judy, The Weakest Link and Countdown, schedulers dare not take anything on trust. For example, Keelan says that the recent BBC1 police drama 55 Degrees North was commissioned for 8pm on Sundays, but when it came in it had a prostitution theme. So it had to go at 9pm on a weekday. </p> <p>Programmes can also suffer in the time lag between commission and broadcast. Channel 4 ordered Don't Worry, a 7.30pm puppet-based current affairs series, from Fulcrum Productions for this autumn. But the incoming director of television, Kevin Lygo, changed the plan: Friday is for entertainment. \"Sometimes a show is pushed to midnight, a victim of the fact that we don't have the slots,\" says Newall. </p> <p>Schedulers can be deeply unpopular. \"You put on your body armour when you come to work,\" she adds. Dixon says: \"You have to be resilient to abuse which comes from all sources.\" \"If you've made a programme, it's your baby, and the biggest disappointment is if it's not right for a slot. It can't be good news all the time,\" says Keelan. </p> <p>But schedulers are also the last common sense line of defence when tragedy occurs and controllers are away. They go through schedules to weed out offensive/ inappropriate programmes. At Channel 4 a film on September 9 called Arlington Road was dropped because it began with a man carrying a wounded boy. </p> <p>At ITV the commercial requirement to hold audience share forces it to shelve poorly performing peak-time series, most recently typified by the drama Making Waves. \"ITV's behaviour is pretty shoddy, a knee-jerk reaction, it really pisses people off. In television we tend to forget that one million is a lot of people,\" says Newall. \"We try not to do it.\" </p> <p>Apart from the daily exercise of compiling the \"television jigsaw\", the schedulers are involved, as Keelan says, \"in all commissioning decisions\", in his case for BBC1. This is another key to their power. They attend the seasonal big rounds of commissioning and routine weekly meetings on drama, factual, entertainment, etc, alongside the channel controllers. They are in constant touch. </p> <p>\"Lorraine Heggessey says it's like being married, without the sex,\" quips Keelan. \"Joined at the hip,\" says Newall, \"You have to get on.\" Bergg spends every Friday with ITV Network director Nigel Pickard in his study in his Kent farmhouse, watching programmes, plotting moves. Ian Lewis expects to speak to James Baker, head of Sky One, by phone \"even when I'm away on holiday\". </p> <p>Jane Root, the former controller of BBC2, says: \"Schedulers understand your audience, they're your right- hand person.\" Dixon helped to devise BBC2's current Sunday evening schedules, skewed towards male viewers, avoiding soppy drama, with programmes such as Top Gear. SAS: Are You Tough Enough? was commissioned as a series of half-hour programmes until Dixon suggested sticking them together as one hours, turning Sunday nights into one of the best evenings for BBC2. Then it was decided to use it to launch 24, and the trick of screening the next episode immediately after on BBC3 - a device avidly copied by everyone else. </p> <p>\"You are worried the whole time. You think about television all day and when you go home, you can't switch off, you switch on,\" says Dixon. That is why they all have a fresh perspective on Big Brother: they cite Channel 4's decision to strip it nightly as \"incredibly brave\", committing weeks and weeks to scheduling something when you don't know what it will be like. </p> <p>All have problems: BBC1 has those Wednesday night dips, no East- Enders and the challenge of being more worthy. BBC2's big challenge is to reduce the number of lifestyle and leisure shows, which are cheap, and replace them with something else. Ray Mears' Extreme Survival is one answer. And the 6-7.30pm slot without The Simpsons is an experiment. BBC3 is discussing doing football, in a BBC3 way. </p> <p>But in a multichannel, Sky Plus environment, do schedulers have a future? \"Oh God, yes,\" says Keelan. Bergg is gloomier: \"It'll be dead, perhaps in five years, with the explosion of choice, via broadband, video on demand. Scheduling will continue, but will be a less powerful factor. The content of shows, their marketing and distribution will be more important.\" Newall disputes this: \"People have had video recorders yet the majority watch live TV. We like the fact that other people are doing the same thing at the same time. I wouldn't sign up to the belief that we'll be all out of business.\" But it is safe to say they are all watching Adam MacDonald's progress on the other side of the business with interest. </p> <p><strong>They saw it first: the schedulers</strong></p> <p><strong> Liam Keelan, scheduler, BBC1</strong> </p> <p>Age 37. He has a degree in German from Warwick University. In 1995, he became an audience researcher for BBC Radio, then did stints with BBC Daytime, BBC2 and UKTV. He moved to become scheduler for BBC1 in 2002. He is a gritty Liverpudlian, who turned ITV's trick of running drama two-parters on Sundays and Mondays to BBC1's advantage. </p> <p><strong> George Dixon, scheduler, BBC2</strong> </p> <p>Age 33. He has a degree from Bournemouth University in communications and psychology. In 1992, joined the BBC in marketing, becoming commissioning assistant and moving into scheduling in 1997. No programming-making experience. Spotted gap for male programmes - Top Gear, 24 and SAS: Are You Tough Enough? - on Sunday nights. </p> <p><strong> David Bergg, ITV director of programme strategy</strong> </p> <p>Age 46. He has a degree in history and international politics from Durham University. With a background in audience research at LWT, he has been scheduler at BBC1 and ITV and controller at Sky One and ITV2. His nickname is \"master of the dark art\". </p> <p><strong> Rosemary Newall, controller broadcasting and scheduling, Channel 4</strong> </p> <p>Age 41. She has a history degree from Exeter University. Her background is in audience research at the BBC, and she became chief scheduler there, training a small group of top schedulers. She joined Channel 4 in 1997. </p> <p><strong> Jules Oldroyd, scheduler, Channel 4</strong> </p> <p>Age 39. She has a degree in economics from the LSE. She trained in advertising sales at TVS and Channel 4, then joined Newall in programme planning and strategy. Has never made a programme. She was the key executive at Channel 4 who took home tapes of Operatunity, and recommended it be played at 9pm. Now Channel 4's next arts binge, Musicality, in which amateurs compete to sing in a West End musical, starting November, is slated to run at 9pm. </p> <p><strong> Susanna Dinnage</strong> , <strong> scheduler, Five</strong> </p> <p>Age 37. She has a degree in French from the University of Kent. Her background is in consumer/audience research for MTV Europe. She joined Five in 1996 to work with David Brook, former marketing director, and became scheduler in 2003. Says she is proud of helping to make it a channel people consider staying with for the evening - rather than the default channel people watch if nothing else is fancied. </p> <p><strong> Ian Lewis, director of broadcasting Sky Networks, who schedules Sky One</strong></p> <p>Age 41. He has a degree in maths and economics from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. Previously a media buyer at Zenith Media - where he made his name with caustic notes on upcoming ITV programmes.

He worked for RTE before moving to BBC as a trainee assistant, channel management; worked on BBC Choice, the precursor of BBC3, where US drama 24 was part of the now widely copied switch over scheduling breakthrough in which audiences watch one episode on BBC2, and can then switch over to BBC3 to watch the next episode.</p>",
  "<p>Media sales people tend to be born optimists. But the last three years has been enough to test the powers of positive thinking of even the most resilient glass-half-full merchant. The dotcom crash compounded by the crisis of confidence following 9/11 combined to spark the sharpest media recession in decades. Advertising spend on TV and national press in the UK declined by 10% between 2000 and 2003. The allure of a career in media sales declined accordingly. </p> <p>The good news is that the good times are back. According to media buying group Aegis, spending on advertising rose 5.7% year on year in the three months to June. And the forecast is that this growth is set to continue. Some media sales directors are predicting increases of as much as 15% over the next 12 months. </p> <p>The result has been an explosion in the demand for good sales people, particularly second-jobbers, say recruitment experts. \"Over the past three years media sales operations have tended to cut back staff and slash graduate recruitment,\" says Carl Dine of media sales recruitment specialist Reilly People. </p> <p>\"As a result there is a missing cohort of people with a year or two's experience in the industry. Now that media owners are rebuilding their sales teams, there is a real shortage of candidates ready for their second job.\" </p> <p>This doesn't mean that second jobbers can name their price, but it does mean that they can afford to be a lot more choosy about which job they take and a little more discerning about the precise nature of their packages. \"Typically you should expect to be earning \u00a32,000-\u00a35,000 a year more and you can negotiate a bit on other benefits,\" says Emy Rumble-Mettle of Recruit Media. </p> <p>For many trainees, the choice of next job is determined by serendipity. But Ed Brennan, a display sales executive for IPC's shooting titles, knew precisely where he wanted to be. So he grabbed his opportunity when it came along, even though he felt that perhaps he wasn't quite ready for it. </p> <p>\"I graduated in history and got a job selling classified ads on Sporting Gun. Obviously my next move would be to display, which I felt would be more challenging. But I was told to wait until my nine-monthly review came up. </p> <p>\"But after seven months, a job selling three shooting titles came up, so I just went for it. I felt I was ready for a bigger role, meeting agencies and clients face to face and doing some presenting. I am especially interested in the subject, and I think that's one reason why I got the job so quickly.\" </p> <p>Others aren't so much drawn to their new job as repelled by the old one. Mat Adams, a group head manager at poster company Maiden Outdoor, started as a sales executive for a large publisher. But after a year he felt increasingly stifled by its bureaucracy and lack of variety. \"I found print a little one-dimensional - after all, a page is a page is a page. And, because it was such a large company, any suggestions for change took ages to progress. I looked at my boss and thought 'do I want his job?' It was at that point I realised I had to leave.\" </p> <p>His intention was to get into radio sales but, much to his surprise, he secured an interview with Maiden Outdoor. \"I liked the fact that they are the biggest in the market and the only domestically owned player. I also liked the fact that they have a fantastically diverse portfolio with hundreds of different packages to sell.\" </p> <p>He took the job and three years later is running a team of 10 with his eyes set on management. </p> <p>For Danny Mansfield, who works on the advertising agency sales team at the Evening Standard, the move to a second job was much more about personal fulfilment than career progress. \"I had been working on classified sales, which is very formulaic. After a year or so I felt that I had learnt as much as I was going to. I went travelling and when I got back a friend of a friend suggested I apply for this job.\" </p> <p>He admits to not being quite sure where his career will progress. But the great thing about media sales, he says, is the diversity of career options it opens up. \"You can go into management, work on the agency side or even client side in sales or marketing.\" </p> <p>The ability to sell is a basic life skill, he says. \"You may not be aware of it but you use basic sales techniques in nearly everything you do. A few years in media sales opens up options and will set you up to succeed in whatever field you finally decide to go into.\"</p>",
  "<p>People called Hunter probably had ancestors who were good at killing animals, and so we can assume that Al Swearengen, the main character in Deadwood, the latest hot import from American television, is so called because he had forebears who swore. </p> <p>A brothel-owner who uses the words \"cocksucker\" and \"fuck\" at the rate other people say hello, Swearengen speaks like this for reasons of history. Whether or not the dialogue is true to South Dakota in 1876, the series' setting, is a matter of opinion, but Al is obeying the language rules of shows produced since the 1990s by the American cable network HBO. </p> <p>In The Sopranos, Sex and the City and Six Feet Under, this company has created an alternative culture of US television, in deliberate opposition to the big networks, whose work is made nervous by advertisers and the perceived Republican churchiness of the core American audience. One of HBO's declarations of difference was to put a foul-mouth where its money is. But, even by previous standards, Deadwood has really taken the oath in this regard. In the script by David Milch (a graduate of Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue), there's barely a speech in the bars, brothels and dust roads of the gold-rush era that doesn't feature the c-word, the f-word and the c-s word. </p> <p>The justification for this - thematically if not historically - is that it's the language of anarchy and defiance. Vocabulary has broken down in the town because so has everything else: Deadwood is in Indian territory, so beyond the reach of American law. Murders occur at the rate of one a day. This series has been the season's hit in America and, whether or not it was intended, this story of lawlessness outside the control of the American authorities can clearly be read as an allegory of Baghdad. </p> <p>Apart from freedom with expletives, what HBO's biggest successes have in common is that they bring the grammar of serial television to movie genres: Sex and the City is a more sexual and feminist rendition of the genre of Manhattan romantic comedy, while The Sopranos resembles what The Godfather and GoodFellas might have become if they had run for 40 hours and been co-scripted by the writers of Analyze This. </p> <p>Deadwood is a television answer - or, perhaps more accurately, a series of questions - to the cinematic western. The director even comes from that tradition: Walter Hill, who made The Long Riders. But what he and Milch have made here is a western that is slow, vicious and nihilistic in a way that very little cinema - and almost no television outside of HBO - would dare to be. The opening episode begins with a hanging and then gets darker. </p> <p>History claims that 90% of the women in Deadwood in the 1870s were prostitutes, and the men of the town buy themselves \"some pussy\" either as a stiffener before going outside to kill someone, or as a reward for having done so. When a man is shot through the head, the local doc casually pushes a rod through the front of his skull to calculate the trajectory. Even less sentimentally, another corpse is used as pig-food. </p> <p>The drama is dark literally as well as tonally. Hill's favoured set-up is a heavily shadowed foreground with the blazing tear-drop of a candle-flame or gas-light at the back. And, when it isn't sounding like subway graffiti, Milch's script has some sweeter moments. When one pioneer reveals, \"I was born in Austria!\", another replies: \"Wonderful where people come from!\" </p> <p>This touches on the idealism of America's history of immigration - although Deadwood shows the dreamers turning to greed and hatred - and so it's appropriate that Deadwood is itself a drama of second chances. Walter Hill has been a neglected director and Ian McShane, who gives a combination of savagery and canniness to Al Swearengen, is saved from toshy mid-Atlantic mini-series by this his best part for many years. </p> <p>HBO is still most widely celebrated for a series about sexuality - Sex and the City - but it's becoming increasingly clear that the outfit's signature subject is death. In The Sopranos, Six Feet Under and now the first of its series actually to have the funeral adjective in its title, these shows have looked unflinchingly at the plot-twist that lies at the end of all our stories. Despite its haul of corpses, Deadwood breathes further life into American television. </p> <p><strong>Day of judgement</strong></p> <p>One of the implications of last night's Greg Dyke documentary shown on Channel 4 was that the post-Hutton BBC might be wary of what it says about Blair. This has been a widespread fear inside and outside the Corporation, but promising contradiction comes in two documentaries marking a decade since Dyke's nemesis became leader of the Labour party. If this is going easy on the prime minister, then he should hope that he is forever spared the hard. </p> <p>The twinned films - one about Blair and the other concerning Blair and Brown's relationship - are fronted by Michael Cockerell, who in recent years has made a distinctive series of documentaries in which retired politicians reflect on their careers by watching scenes of themselves from the BBC archives. </p> <p>Although often spiky - Roy Jenkins and Edward Heath, among others, bristled at certain questions - the politicians that Cockerell was dealing with in this series belonged to biographers rather than journalists. So taking on the serving holders of the two highest posts in British politics would have been a bold development even before Hutton. </p> <p>The change of tactic also alters Cockerell's structure. Denied a contemporary interview with either Blair or Brown, he is reliant on chats with their acolytes and clips from his own programmes. </p> <p>This recycling, though, is the programmes' strength. For all the bleats about repeats, it can be argued that too much of television's output is forgotten. Here, Cockerell devastatingly rescreens footage of Brown and Blair's early TV appearances - and later photo-opportunities to suggest agreement between No 10 and No 11: an uneasy tennis match, a night in drinking beer in front of the footie. </p> <p>The first of the films, Do You Still Believe in Tony?, features media figures - Richard Eyre, Rory Bremner, John O'Farrell - explaining how they lost their faith in Blair. The journey from reverence in 1997 to incredulity now is bleakly charted and, if Alastair Campbell were still at No 10, this programme alone would be enough for attempts to get the BBC closed down. </p> <p>The second documentary, Friends and Neighbours, is a sharp job of reporting on the tensions of the PM-chancellor relationship which, Cockerell is told, are known to the staff of the two men as either \"the TB-GBs\" or, after events in New York three years ago, as \"10/11\". </p> <p>The film is filled with such details worthy of a real-life The West Wing, which, we learn, is Tony's favourite programme, while Gordon's is Friends. We're also told (by former spin-doc Charlie Whelan) that Blair would beg for chummy photo-ops with Gordon when the euro caused him trouble. In the most chilling use of archive, Cockerell finds a scene in which Brown, passing Blair in a Downing Street corridor, almost ignores him. </p> <p>Elegantly made and editorially brave, these films are likely to ensure that Blair and Brown won't be available to Cockerell if he ever wants to make one of his old-style programmes to coincide with their out-of-power memoirs.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Deadwood, Tuesday, 10pm, Sky One <br> Do You Still Believe in Tony? and Friends and Neighbours, Saturday, BBC2</p>",
  "Each day, we are offered a feast of new reasons to be angry about what is happening in Iraq. In consequence, there is a danger that the old grounds for rage will be forgotten. That is why we should welcome Friday's leak to the New York Times of the Iraq Survey Group's draft final report on WMD. <p>The ISG concludes, according to the NYT, that Saddam Hussein abandoned his WMD programme in the 1990s because he perceived the lifting of international sanctions as the vital objective of his regime. </p> <p>The report should be a grave embarrassment to France, Russia and China, if they were capable of such sentiment. Their campaign to lift sanctions in pursuit of commercial advantage would, if successful, have had disastrous consequences. Iraqi scientists told the ISG that the moment sanctions ended, they would have been put to back to work on Saddam's nuclear programme. In other words, we can today perceive that the pre-Bush policy of containing Saddam was fulfilling its purposes. </p> <p>Yet for most of us, the crucial point of the report is its confirmation that Iraq possessed no WMD when the coalition invaded. It acknowledges a possibility that some nasty substances were removed to Syria or Cuba. But there is not a shred of evidence. Robin Cook was right. </p> <p>We are left, therefore, with the greatest failure of western intelligence in modern times. In the US, the CIA's director was months ago obliged to resign. In Britain, Tony Blair's response has been to appoint as director of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) the officer most closely identified with the disaster, John Scarlett. </p> <p>Anyone who cares about our security interests ought to be appalled, and to stay appalled. The notion that nobody has been sacked, that Blair is likely to be re-elected next year, is a historic scandal. It is not remotely good enough to shelter behind the obfuscations of Lords Butler and Hutton, that everyone acted in good faith. That is equivalent to exonerating the captain of a certain large liner for driving at reckless speed through iceberg waters on the grounds that he was confident it was unsinkable. </p> <p>The WMD saga is a not a matter of ancient history. It possesses critical implications for our future. In the 21st century, western societies are unlikely to be threatened by aggressors who launch tanks into Belgium or Poland. Instead, the risk - a very real and great one - will come from regimes and terrorist movements capable of inflicting great harm without overtly breaching national frontiers. </p> <p>This places an unprecedented responsibility on our intelligence services. The governments of the US and Britain will be chiefly dependent on the CIA and SIS for information about what our enemies are doing. The threat will not be visible. Its gravity will have to be judged in cold blood by national leaders, advised by intelligence and defence chiefs. </p> <p>It is likely that pre-emptive military action will some time seem vital. One of the few sensible things George Bush has said since September 2001 is that we cannot wait for a smoking gun, if it is to be a mushroom cloud. </p> <p>This is why the WMD failure is so catastrophic. Bush and Blair recklessly abused the doctrine of pre-emption. By praising the leaders of the SIS and CIA, they also crippled our faith in the competence of the western intelligence community. Those of us who trusted the British government on WMD feel foolish today, and would not make the mistake again. </p> <p>We should not forget that, when giving evidence to the Hutton inquiry, Sir Richard Dearlove and John Scarlett were granted an opportunity to distance themselves from the government's use of intelligence material. They declined. They associated themselves clearly and publicly with the Blair-Campbell line. In consequence, it is far less likely that the British people will again feel justified in supporting military action on the basis of an intelligence judgment, and certainly not one interpreted by Tony Blair. </p> <p>Who, outside Downing Street, could now accept at face value a threat assessment of Iran or North Korea signed by John Scarlett? To say such a thing is not to display vindictiveness, when Lord Butler obligingly asserted that he could see no reason why Scarlett should not become head of SIS. It is to state the politically obvious. Even in Bush's America, the credibility of the CIA has suffered equally severely. </p> <p>Today, we know that the Iranians are working furiously to accelerate their nuclear programme, because they are as capable as ourselves of working all this out. Tehran perceives a window of opportunity, especially in the run-up to the US presidential election. Iran's rulers know that even George Bush cannot take military action against them in the present American domestic climate. </p> <p>I am not seeking to advocate such action - merely to observe that the west's options, its ability to pursue a credible strategy of deterrence towards North Korea and Iran, have been critically diminished by the Iraq fiasco. </p> <p>None of this supports a proposition that all intelligence is bunk, or that its practitioners are fools. The quality of SIS personnel around the world is generally impressive. In the dangerous world in which we live, we are fortunate to have so many able agents. But the standing of the SIS's current leadership has been fatally wounded by association with Alastair Campbell and the prime minister. </p> <p>There is another lesson. It has been a fundamental tenet of British foreign policy since 1945 that the value of our intimate intelligence exchange with the US is so great that we must be prepared to do almost anything, including joining Republican military adventures, to sustain it. </p> <p>In Iraq, we have learned that the price of access to Langley's decrypts can become too high. The WMD nonsense also suggests that the SIS/CIA relationship has been too close for either nation's good; the consequence was that each service, under considerable pressure from its government, signed up to the other's Iraq misjudgments. </p> <p>When the final ISG report is officially published, John Scarlett would, in a reasonable world, feel obliged to resign. Yet Scarlett survives because of Tony Blair's loyalty to his instrument in folly, and remains secure at Vauxhall Cross, apparently beyond embarrassment. </p> <p>It is all very British. In accordance with what might be called the Lamont/Black Wednesday doctrine, it is agreed that, since lots of people are to blame for a disaster, it would be unjust to make any one walk the plank. Yet it bears stating again and again that we went to war, launching thousands of British soldiers into Iraq, on a pretext now conclusively exposed as false. </p> <p>It defies belief that no one in this country has been held accountable. Intelligence has never seemed more important to our defence. Yet seldom has its credibility seemed more threadbare, thanks to a prime minister who discards all other considerations in favour of his own political interest.</p>",
  "<p> Kent wrapped up a satisfying victory over Middlesex with a day and 11 overs to spare, confirming second place in the championship and \u00a350,000 in prize money. </p> <p>Ironically, the disgruntled group of members, led by Graham Long, a chauffeur, but crucially backed by the millionaire businessman Stewart Stennett, Mark Ealham's father-in-law, had just collected the 100 signatures needed to force an extraordinary general meeting of the membership. </p> <p>This could potentially result in a vote of no confidence in the management of the club. Runners-up slot notwithstanding there have been worries and disappointments. </p> <p>The prolific Ed Smith has sometimes been aloof from certain other players, though the chief stirrer Andrew Symonds is unlikely to return, and is believed to be considering a move, probably to Middlesex. Robert Key is also out of contract but England commitments may restrict his movements. Their contributions to this win were 189 and 131 respectively. </p> <p>Kent were relegated in the National League, and the committee's refusal to agree to Ealham's terms a year ago still rankles. </p> <p>It has also been a wonderful year for the left-hander Matthew Walker who in this game passed 1,000 runs for the second time in two years. </p> <p>On Saturday morning he reached an elegant 173-ball century before attempting to sweep James Dalrymple, dragging his foot just over the line. When David Stiff gave Ben Hutton his third short-leg catch of the morning Kent had a first innings lead of 300. </p> <p>It was a sign of how the day was to progress that, on a wearing wicket, the spinners Dalrymple and Paul Weekes had bagged six victims. So it proved - soon Alex Loudon and Min Patel were wheeling away. The options for Kent were limited by poor light, but it was to be Loudon's day. It was Patel, however, who made early inroads, persuading catches from Hutton and Owais Shah. </p> <p>Either side of tea Ed Joyce dug in but saw three further wickets soon fall. Joyce went to 50 in a defiant 68 balls but as resistance withered at the other end he aimed a frustrated lofted drive at Loudon, who finished with a career-best 6-47, and Kent were home.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1</strong> His selections. Colin Montgomerie and Luke Donald were perfect. Langer knows everything about Monty and he probably sees much of himself in Donald: the Englishman is blond, quiet, self-contained, determined. </p> <p><strong> </strong> 2The rookies. It was vital to use all five of them before the singles, even though he had to pair David Howell and Paul Casey to do it. It proved crucial. The captain said: \"I really felt they would be the surprise of the morning.\" </p> <p><strong>3 </strong> The charm offensive. The Europeans earned plaudits with their sunny demeanour and willingness to sign autographs and chat to the fans. Also, the players' celebrations were relatively restrained, with no histrionics. </p> <p><strong> 4 </strong> The uniforms. From the moment they stepped off the aeroplane in caramel suede jackets with open-necked white shirts with a very fine brown check, the Europeans were on the front foot sartorially, as Sutton, uncomfortable in suit, collar and tie, conceded. </p> <p> <strong>Where Sutton got it wrong</strong></p> <p> <strong>1</strong> The nightmare pairing that was Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. They don't have much rapport and as a pair they were wasted. The fact that they lost twice was a big bonus for Europe. Superstars both but bad karma as a team. </p> <p> <strong> 2</strong> Allowing Chris Riley to miss Saturday's foursomes after winning with Woods in the four-balls. Riley said he was drained; Sutton's reply, \"A 42-year-old fat man in '99 [Sutton] went five straight matches - I'm sure a 30-year-old flat belly can go four. Can't ya?\" did not convince Riley, who sat out. </p> <p> <strong> 3</strong> Not paying attention to the foursomes. The US have a good record but they seemed to baffle Sutton, who left too much to chance. His players didn't practise it at all before the match. </p> <p> <strong> 4</strong> Too many horizontal stripes. Lots of bold combinations of red, white and blue for the US shirts but horizontal is not a slimming look and everybody knows that TV makes people look fat. A fashion double bogey. </p>",
  "<p>So it wasn't just a matter of pairing up the claret drinkers and cigar smokers, of persuading the players to smile and sign autographs during the practice rounds, of providing enough ping-pong tables in the team room, and of making Colin Montgomerie feel like the king of the Detroit suburbs. </p> <p>Bernhard Langer did all those things, and so light was his touch that at times it looked as though that was all he did. In the end, however, Europe regained the Ryder Cup yesterday thanks to the kind of relentless micro-management that defines success in modern team sports. </p> <p>He had hidden it brilliantly behind the smokescreen of a charm offensive which ensured that no matter how partisan the home spectators became, very little ill feeling was directed at the visiting players, who were allowed to concentrate on the task of dismantling the US challenge with little distraction. </p> <p>Not until Saturday night was the European captain's mask allowed to slip, revealing the true nature of his leadership. Padraig Harrington and Paul McGinley had finally left the Irish celebrations on the 15th green, in the wake of their alternate-shot victory over Tiger Woods and Davis Love III, and made it to the press conference when they were asked what part Langer had played in Europe's overwhelming success in the first two days' play. Their replies revealed a man whose role extended far beyond charging around the course acting like a cheerleader on a buggy. </p> <p>\"Bernhard is obviously a very, very well organised and structured individual, so there's nothing left to chance,\" McGinley began. \"But I think where we've gained a lot of benefit is in his presence on the golf course. He's given us advice on course management and club selection and pin position all the way round. That certainly is a big help.\" </p> <p>Invited to be more specific about the help the captain had been giving, Harrington chipped in with a very precise and illuminating description of Langer's role. </p> <p>\"On all of the par threes,\" Harrington said, \"he's come up, told me the club to play, the place to hit it, why to hit it there. He's gone through the whole thing, explaining the shape and everything about it on every par three I've played this week, in the foursomes and the four-ball. He's been right there, describing exactly what was needed.\" </p> <p>Telling a player ranked eighth among the world's golfers where to put his tee shot on a 170-yard hole cannot have been the easiest of tasks, even for a man with two US Masters wins and 10 Ryder Cup appearances to his own name, and Harrington was willing to say as much. </p> <p>\"Sometimes that's . . . you know, obviously he says it in a nice way, because when someone nominates a shot for you, it can be difficult,\" he said. \"But it's very cool, calm and collected when he's saying it. It's not like he's telling you to do it, but he's definitely advising you.\" </p> <p>Nothing in Langer's manner or words during the week had indicated the extent of his on-course control of his players. In public, his contribution had been limited to selecting the pairings and combining a civilised degree of optimism about Europe's chances with a firm insistence that his team arrived on American soil as underdogs. When the words of McGinley and Harrington were put to him, however, he was forced to confirm the true extent of his influence, and the care with which he had exerted it over players who are used to making their own decisions. </p> <p>\"It's a very fine line,\" he said. \"I talked to them about it before we started the matches. I talked to them in the team room, and I told them what I think is the best and they all agreed and they like the idea of me being out there and every once in a while telling them where the best place is to put the ball on a certain green, to have an easier putt or to have an easier opportunity to get it up and down or make a birdie.\" </p> <p>So severe were the greens at Oakland Hills, he said, that no amount of familiarity could prepare a player for the challenge of extreme pin positions and putting surfaces that firmed up and speeded up during the day. As an example he took the tee shots by Harrington and Woods at the short 13th. Harrington's effort finished short of the flag, as per the captain's instruction, leaving McGinley a long putt. </p> <p>\"But at least we had a putt,\" Langer explained. \"Tiger hit what looked like a fairly decent shot, but it went long, and you can't go long here. He plugged his ball in the back bunker. It's a tremendously tough shot if you have a good lie, and if you have a plugged lie you have no chance. We won the hole.\" </p> <p>It put the European pair three up, and two holes later they were earning the penultimate point of a day in which Europe had successfully repelled the anticipated US counter-attack. While the Irishmen accepted the congratulations of their captain and team-mates, Woods stalked off and headed up the 16th fairway, all alone until caught by his breathless girlfriend, whose consoling pat on the back received no sign of acknowledgement. </p> <p>Six hours earlier, Woods had taken exactly the same walk in a very different frame of mind. He and Chris Riley, a friend from his days in college golf, had defeated Darren Clarke and Ian Poulter, apparently setting the seal on a revival that began between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, when all four US pairings won the first hole of the day in an orgy of pumped fists. But as the day progressed and the air slowly leaked from the balloon of American patriotic fervour, the difference between Langer's captaincy and that of Hal Sutton, his opposite number, became even more marked. </p> <p>Even set aside the absurd displays of military might and emotional extravagance that preceded the tournament, among which Sutton's lachrymose tribute to his wife during the opening ceremony was merely the most bizarre episode, the US captain's performance lacked substance. </p> <p>Where Langer was as firm with his big-name players as with his rookies, Sutton demonstrated an indulgence that did nobody any favours. If he was powerless to prevent Phil Mickelson's commercially motivated decision to switch from one make of clubs and balls to another a couple of weeks before the tournament, then he could certainly have insisted that Mickelson behave as the rest of the team did, rather than allowing him to skip Wednesday's practice sessions on the ground that this was how the US Masters champion habitually prepares himself for a major tournament. </p> <p>For all his sheriff's hat and his ranch-hand's vocabulary, Sutton showed weakness in his treatment of Mickelson. He showed it again after he had allowed Chris Riley, whose presence in Mickelson's place had energised Woods on Friday morning, to stay in the clubhouse that afternoon, pleading exhaustion and a lack of confidence with the alternate-shot format. </p> <p>Riley is a mere 30 years old. He had played only two rounds of golf in a day and a half. Yes, his wife had given birth to their first child a week earlier. But he had been touted by Sutton as bringing a youthful zest to the team, and it should not have been beyond the captain's powers to remind him why he was there and what was at stake. </p> <p>Langer, by contrast, filled his players with confidence. Each of them was made to feel that his efforts were as vital as anyone else's. \"There's no stars, and there are no rookies, as such,\" he said on the eve of the tournament. \"They are 12 fantastic players and I'm here to serve them and lead them and guide them in any way possible.\" </p> <p>His attitude enabled him to select two rookies, Paul Casey and David Howell, to go out together and confront Jim Furyk and Chad Campbell in a Saturday four-ball. On a difficult morning, the young Englishmen produced a gritty last-ditch victory that inspired the rest of the team to harden their resistance to the home assault. </p> <p>\"Many of you probably thought I was sacrificing a point when I sent them out,\" Langer said, \"but I really felt deep down that they would be the surprise of the morning. And I'm obviously very pleased that it happened, especially how it happened. To win the last two holes and gain a huge point gave us the momentum swing that we were hoping for. It changed everything.\" </p> <p>Most of his gambles came off so well that they camouflaged his rare failures. Thomas Levet's twitchy putting went virtually unnoticed. Poulter benefited from the company of Clarke against Woods and Riley on his sole outing before the singles round. </p> <p>The successful Belfry partnership of Sergio Garc\u00eda and Lee Westwood was retained for the four-balls, but Langer took the chance of splitting them up for the foursomes, in which they remained unbeaten. And there was no fuss when, noting Montgomerie's lacklustre showing on Saturday morning, the captain stood the talismanic Scot down for the afternoon foursomes and was immediately rewarded by the quality of McGinley's support for Harrington. </p> <p>By taking Europe to so famous a victory, Langer set himself alongside Sir Clive Woodward, Jose Mourinho, Johan Bruyneel of Lance Armstrong's US Postal outfit and Jean Todt of Ferrari among modern team managers whose attention to detail is at least as important as their ability to inspire an emotional reaction from their squads. </p> <p>Yesterday, knowing that Sutton could only send his players out in ranking order, implicitly challenging them to justify their status, he shuffled the pack and trusted that three or four of his experienced men would produce the goods. With a dozen matches on the course, and Michael Jordan striding along the fairway urging his friend Tiger Woods to \"kill or be killed\", the time for micro- management was over. And when Montgomerie, a captain's pick, tapped home his four-footer to secure the victory and send his team-mates into a dance of delight around the 18th green, Langer's job was done.</p>",
  "<p> Paul Grayson's broken hand makes Northampton's stalwart fly-half a doubt for the start of the Heineken Cup programme next month and the injury completed a painful weekend all-round for the Saints. </p> <p>Northampton had begun the season like a sprinter blasting from the blocks. Ten tries from two opening wins hinted at better times until this crash into the first real hurdle. With Leicester and Wasps next up on the fixture list, the coming fortnight will determine whether Saints' followers have just watched another false dawn break over the East Midlands. This was a sobering reality check for those fans who had been sceptical of the wisdom of signing so many South Africans during the summer that one half expects Northampton to run out in dark green shirts. </p> <p>Northampton's new coach Alan Solomons, another South African who has come to England via Ulster, was gracious afterwards, admitting Gloucester deserved to win a meeting of two clubs with Premiership pretensions. Statistics may lie and many a coach has hidden behind them but Gloucester's 80 tackles to Northampton's 31 tell the story of a committed performance by the visitors whose own supporters had travelled with a sense of foreboding. </p> <p>Two inexperienced props in Nick Wood and Terry Sigley had to lock horns with Northampton's Tom Smith and Robbie Kempson, who have out-scrummaged the best of them. Sigley may go unrecognised even on the streets of rugby-mad Gloucester but he held his own against Smith and created the first try for his hooker Olivier Azam with a well-timed run. </p> <p>\"We weren't steamrollered up front and the two props were outstanding,\" said Gloucester's director of rugby Nigel Melville, who saw another prop Gary Powell drop out injured on the morning of the match. Melville expects to have his England tight-head Phil Vickery back in training this week after a back operation. He should be fit for the Heineken Cup campaign. </p> <p>Vickery could be joined before long in the England squad by Alex Brown, outstanding in the lineout, and Jamie Forrester, a No8 who may eventually step into Lawrence Dallaglio's shoes. Forrester was sin-binned for killing the ball a quarter of an hour from time but in 65 minutes stamped his impression on the game. He had been suffering from 'flu two days before the game but after dislocating his shoulder last year is gradually rediscovering his form of two seasons ago. </p> <p>Duncan McRae controlled the match expertly outside the outstanding Andy Gomarsall and, with every teasing kick to the corner, the spirit sapped from Northampton's forwards. </p> <p>When McRae tried this tactic for a final time with Gloucester clinging on by a point there was a bonus of seeing Marcel Garvey sprint past the subdued Ben Cohen and roll beneath the England wing for the second try. </p> <p>Garvey and his fellow wing James Simpson-Daniel looked far sharper than their opposite numbers, the far bulkier Cohen and John Rudd. It was a meeting of fleet-footed middleweights and Garvey's try was a knockout blow. </p> <p> <strong> Northampton:</strong> Reihana; Rudd, Tucker, Stcherbina, Cohen; Grayson (Drahm, 11), Howard; Smith, Thompson, Kempson, Boome, Browne (Lord, 58), Blowers (Fox, 58), Krige (capt), Seely. </p> <p><strong> Pens:</strong> Drahm 4. </p> <p><strong> Gloucester:</strong> Goodridge; Garvey, Fanolua, Paul, Simpson-Daniel; McRae, Gomarsall; Wood, Azam (Fortey, 53), Sigley, Buxton, Brown, Boer (capt), Hazell (Balding, 52), Forrester. </p> <p><strong> Tries:</strong> Azam, Garvey. <strong> Con:</strong> Paul. <strong> Pen:</strong> Paul. <strong> Drop-goal:</strong> McRae. </p> <p><strong> Sin-bin:</strong> Forrester, 65. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> S Lander (Liverpool). </p> <p><strong> Attendance:</strong> 12,093.</p>",
  "<p> At last some ICC nail-biting of the right kind. It may have taken two out-of-sorts teams and a weekend to complete but yesterday the Champions Trophy could celebrate a tight finish as the West Indies middle order outmanoeuvred the South African bowlers with only seven balls to spare. </p> <p>And Brian Lara, who had sloped off after Saturday night's press conference like a man so bored with the whole thing he could barely be bothered to pick up his feet, could eat his Sunday lunch to shouts of \"We love you Lara\" echoing round The Oval. His prize is a semi-final against Pakistan at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday. </p> <p>Lara could congratulate himself on forging some West Indian steel in his batting partners as his improving one-day side first restricted South Africa's final total after a century-opening partnership and then engineered another successful run-chase. </p> <p>\"We showed a lot of character,\" he said afterwards. \"We won the crucial parts of the game. Myself and [Ramnaresh] Sarwan laid the foundations. We consolidated and didn't worry about the run-rate and we saw [Ricardo] Powell and Chanderpaul win it in style.\" </p> <p>It was a calm batting performance by West Indies, who had refused to panic after Shaun Pollock took two early wickets and Lara was nearly run out attempting his first run. </p> <p>They struggled to move the ball off a sluggish square, one which Lara later criticised as \"not conducive to proper shots\". And with 25 overs gone, only 87 on the board and Chris Gayle and Wavell Hinds back in the pavilion, the chances of West Indies progressing to the semi-finals looked slim. </p> <p>But they had consolidated deceptively well. Lara, who hit five familiar classy boundaries, charged Nicky Boj\u00e9 and was bowled for 49 but Sarwan, who had crawled to double figures in 38 balls, at last found his timing and was soon hitting two huge sixes on his way to 75. </p> <p>Chanderpaul seemed in command from the moment he walked in and Powell did all that he was there for, scoring two identical sixes off two identical consecutive balls as Shaun Pollock's last over went for 19. </p> <p>With the total suddenly down to less than a run a ball, West Indies eased themselves to a victory celebrated with much tooting and hooting. </p> <p>For South Africa it was the end of a miserable English autumn mini-break that had failed to halt their one-day rot. On Saturday they had been roared on all the way by a largely pro-South African crowd who boozily revelled in Herschelle Gibbs's first century since the 2003 World Cup but the Sunday-morning Oval was pure maroon and it seemed to sap their confidence. </p> <p>Even a finger-pointing pep-talk by the towering figure of Graeme Smith at a crucial point of the match as Chanderpaul got treatment for cramp could not produce any magic formula at the end. </p> <p>Smith, who looked unfamiliarly ill at ease after the game, fiddling with his microphone and looking at the ground, gave the performance the best gloss he could. </p> <p>\"I thought we were in control all the time, we didn't rush, we thought about what we needed to do. I think you have to give credit to Sarwan and Lara, who were under a lot of pressure, and they set up the game for someone like Powell, who came off in one over and it was game set and match. I can't question the way we performed in the field.\" </p> <p>And so South Africa troop home to a month off the international whirlwind and some soul-searching.</p>",
  "<p> Surrey's fourth victory in five matches gave them third place in the championship and, while some people feel the season has lasted quite long enough, Steve Rixon, the coach at The Oval, last night wore the wistful expression of someone who wished it would run until November. </p> <p>This was their fifth win of the season - as many as the champions Warwickshire - but in midsummer they were being touted for relegation. \"I'm delighted with our finish but, to be honest, I never thought relegation was an option,\" said the man who has transformed affairs at The Oval. </p> <p>One of the players who has responded is Nayan Doshi, son of Dilip, a slow left-armer with control and rhythm who took seven for 110 yesterday to make it 10 in the match and 33 in nine matches at 26.51. </p> <p>This was a fine game between the champions of 2002 and 2003 and Surrey did exceptionally well to win it after being 14 for four on the opening morning. </p> <p>Sussex, set 324 to win in 80 overs after taking the final Surrey wickets in a rush, were favourites while Murray Goodwin was with Chris Adams and then Matt Prior. </p> <p>If Goodwin were an impresario, his aim would be to send the crowd home with a smile on their faces, even if they had looked a little quizzical throughout the performance. </p> <p>Last season he made up for a moderate season by scoring an unbeaten 335 - the highest score by a Sussex player - as Sussex beat Leicestershire in their final match to win the championship. This year his form has been even more ordinary but he scored a terrific 119 yesterday to take Sussex close to the win that would have won them bronze. </p> <p>Sussex had scored two when Richard Montgomerie was caught behind off Tim Murtagh. Then Tony Cottey, playing his final innings, made four before he toe-ended a sweep to Murtagh on the deep square-leg boundary. </p> <p>The crowd, who had greeted his arrival with a standing ovation, then gave him another. Cottey's six seasons at Hove have been patchy but he played a big part in that championship success. </p> <p>Sussex, 14 for two after 11 overs at lunch, were behind the rate. And they were 49 for three when Mike Yardy top-edged his sweep. Then Adams (41) and Prior (39) helped Goodwin place Sussex in control. </p> <p>Adams was well caught and bowled by Doshi and, when Prior hit Jimmy Ormond up in the air, it triggered a collapse that saw six wickets fall for 44 runs as Surrey eased home by 37. </p> <p>Surrey had resumed on 260 for six. Alistair Brown, 93 overnight, went to his century from 119 deliveries, with 11 fours and two sixes. There were two more fours before he was bowled by Jason Lewry, hitting to leg going for pre-declaration runs. </p> <p>Lewry then yorked Ormond, first ball, before bowling Doshi, second ball, with a similar delivery, to bring the Sur rey innings to an abrupt end. Brown, who made a timid start to the season, has scored 856 runs from his last 13 championship innings at an average of 65.85, with three centuries. Like Goodwin, this is clearly a cricketer who believes in last impressions.</p>",
  "<p>Latin is not often heard at football grounds. Anglo-Saxon is preferred. But, when the vice chancellor of the University of East Anglia completed his citation with \" honoris causa\" , he got the biggest cheer so far. And that was at half-time. </p> <p>Norwich had become the first Premiership club to receive an honorary degree, \"in recognition of the club's commitment to the local community and promotion of the city across the globe\". No doubt there was dancing in the streets of Timbuktu. </p> <p>The gowns were pretty, the hats dotty and the ceremony ended with bowing and doffing. It might have been the House of Commons except there were no intruders. And that was just as well. The doctorate was in civil law. </p> <p>The first half had been almost as deferential. Norwich, for all their protestations to the contrary, suggested too much respect, too little belief in goalscoring attack. Nigel Worthington said: \"I like a nice team but we've added a little steel and I'm glad we're solid. If we keep doing what we are, the points will come.\" </p> <p>Three could have come here but David Bentley, after hooking and slicing earlier approach shots, took his niblick when presented with a straightforward putt. \"We're passing well but are not calm enough in the final third,\" he said, blaming no one but himself. </p> <p>Nor were they clever enough in the final third and they were too careful to commit men forward. Bentley was the front of a midfield diamond that lacked cutting edge and sparkle, and so any point. There was poise but no penetration and crosses came mostly from overlapping full-backs to no one in particular or Gary Doherty, which came to much the same thing. He lacks a forward's instincts. </p> <p>Doherty was bought as a centre-back but has not been able to displace Craig Fleming or Simon Charlton who, though they sometimes receded as far as their hair-lines, came forcefully out to attack anything that threatened their territory. \"You get me \u00a325m and I'll get you goals,\" said Worthington. </p> <p>Norwich are over-ready, as a result, to look to Darren Huckerby, a willing outlet for harassed defenders but in need of intelligent support. Too often his terrorising corkscrew runs left a trail of twisted defenders, only to peter out, if need be, with a foul. Mark Delaney was booked thus. The Speaker would no doubt have reported that Huckerby was \"overturned\". </p> <p>For both sides this was a second successive goalless draw and both seemed unreasonably happy about it. Aston Villa's final pass was as poor as Norwich's but they did bring three fine saves from Robert Green, one plunging head first at Carlton Cole's feet to flip the ball away as he tried to round him, another at the near post to deny Steve Davis what might have been a winning pot on his debut. </p> <p>Gavin McCann was spiky and Gareth Barry's strong refusal to give the ball away showed he could still fill England's left midfield spot with a lesson to others; lightning pace is not all. But Darius Vassell looked way below Jermain Defoe in international terms. </p> <p>This was a flaky Villa performance that implied they do not really mean business. David O'Leary talked of his babies at Leeds and now of \"a squad of 14 and a bunch of kids\". Some day he and they may grow up. As for Norwich, it would be a shame if their season proceeded in nil-nil desperandum . </p> <p><strong> Man of the match:</strong> Gareth Barry (Aston Villa)</p>",
  "<p> Fulham are likely to face an investigation by the Football Association after wasting no time in putting into practice the lesson taught them by Mark Halsey - that players can influence referees to change their minds. </p> <p>Barely a week had passed since Halsey's decision to rescind a penalty awarded in Fulham's favour, because the reactions of Arsenal's players had put a doubt in his mind, when Chris Coleman's team were given the chance to test their persuasive powers. </p> <p>The incident came after the referee Mike Dean penalised Moritz Volz for handling a header from the West Bromwich Albion striker Robert Earnshaw. </p> <p>\"When I gave the penalty about six Fulham players surrounded me and I will be reporting that to the FA,\" said Dean. </p> <p>\"Every time I gave a decision they just wanted to harass me.\" </p> <p>Keith Hackett, the manager of the referees' select group, did not reject the notion that Fulham's conduct was a legacy of Halsey's honesty and said: \"One can make an assumption that is a possibility but there's still no excuse. </p> <p>\"Mark's comments last week came immediately after the heat of the match and he probably did not put as much thought in what he wanted to say.\" </p> <p>The FA will not comment on the issue until it has read Dean's report but its interest is unlikely to end there. </p> <p>Papa Diop and Andy Cole were both shown the red card for violent conduct, an offence that more often than not these days is anything but. </p> <p>Not on this occasion, though. Diop, seemingly avenging an earlier tackle by Darren Purse, slapped the West Brom defender's face. And Cole, the only player to be punished in a brawl that was actually worthy of the description, was sent off for aiming a right hook at Neil Clement. Seconds earlier Clement had himself been dismissed for bringing down the goal-bound Luis Boa Morte. </p> <p>Clubs have been charged with failing to control their players for less and Coleman, who has been asked to explain his comments after the Halsey affair, could be in more trouble for indirectly condoning their actions. </p> <p>\"My directors and my chairman might want to fine them [Cole and Diop] but I'm not going to,\" he said. \"I ask them to go out and give 100% for me; once they do something wrong I just can't jump on the bandwagon and punish them. They are devastated in there. I couldn't ask for more commitment.\" </p> <p>Neither could West Brom's manager Gary Megson, whose players displayed more acceptable battling qualities in recovering from the shock of Cole putting Fulham ahead. </p> <p>Nwankwo Kanu headed home Jason Koumas's corner to earn a point which could have been three had Earnshaw, who was making his first start for West Brom after his \u00a33m move from Cardiff, converted that penalty. Instead, perhaps unnerved by a delay as Fulham's dissidents badgered the referee, the striker scooped the ball over the crossbar. </p> <p>\"When we get them we've got to convert them,\" said Megson. \"The penalty itself was a big turning point; it wasn't up to standard. That was two points lost.\" </p> <p><strong> Man of the match:</strong> Edwin van der Sar (Fulham)</p>",
  "<p> West Ham's new signing Malky Mackay expected a hostile reception from the Ipswich supporters, having led Norwich to promotion last season. However, the Scotland defender silenced their taunts by scoring his first goal for West Ham, and his fourth in five games against the old enemy. </p> <p>\"I'll have a little smile on my face looking back at that one,\" said Mackay. \"A number of the [Norwich] boys said good luck for today's game; they knew how much stick I was going to get, and I'll be seeing them tonight so that will be good.\" </p> <p>Mackay, deemed surplus to requirements at Carrow Road, would have been happier still had Teddy Sheringham converted a first-half penalty; his miss proved costly when Pablo Counago later levelled. </p> <p>But Sheringham's profligacy was not the sole reason for West Ham's failure to secure three points. Ipswich's goalkeeper Kelvin Davis was in outstanding form. \"There aren't any better keepers in the division than Kelvin,\" said Ipswich's manager Joe Royle. </p> <p>Apart from an early Darren Bent chance, West Ham dominated the opening period. They took the lead after 11 minutes when Mackay headed in Luke Chadwick's cross. Home fans sensed a repeat of last season's play-off victory over Ipswich, but Davis had other ideas. One double save that denied Mackay and then Sheringham brought a handshake from the veteran striker. </p> <p>The same two players were face to face again moments later after Davis felled Carl Fletcher. This time the mere presence of Davis proved enough, as Sheringham dragged his penalty wide. \"It's a tactic of mine to dive completely the wrong way and I think that confused him,\" joked Davis. His next comment was certainly true. \"I think it gave the team a boost.\" </p> <p>Ipswich, galvanised by Sheringham's miss, levelled in the 57th minute. Jim Magilton's corner dropped to Counago and the Spaniard swivelled before shooting past Stephen Bywater. Bent might have won the match with a curling shot that struck the crossbar, and Marlon Harewood should have done better at the other end when he failed to touch in Matthew Etherington's cross. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match:</strong> Kelvin Davis (Ipswich Town)</p>"
