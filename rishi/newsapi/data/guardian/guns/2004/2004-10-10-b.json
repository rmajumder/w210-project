  "<p>Saul David is a historian and broadcaster. He specializes in wars of empire and is the author of The Indian Mutiny (shortlisted for the Westminster medal for military literature). His latest book, Zulu: The Heroism and Tragedy of the Zulu War of 1879, is published by Viking (\u00a320).</p> <h2>1. The Boer War by Thomas Packenham</h2> <p>Eight years in the making - and it shows. Packenham's exhaustive research in numerous archives in Britain and South Africa, not to mention interviews with more than 50 survivors, resulted in a completely new take on many aspects of the war: the crucial role of two Rand millionaires in precipitating it; the feud between the British generals Buller and Roberts; and the plight of the 100,000 black Africans who served both sides. A fast-paced narrative - with wonderful descriptions of the fighting - is merely the icing on the cake.</p> <h2>2. The Washing of the Spears by Donald Robert Morris</h2> <p>Donald Morris's peerless narrative is both a history of the rise and fall of the Zulu nation and a no-holds-barred account of British colonial and military policy in South Africa. The chapters on the Zulu War of 1879, particularly the battles of Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, are spellbinding. But if Morris's scholarship is impressive, it is the quality of his sparkling prose that makes this book one of the greats.</p> <h2>3. My Traitor's Heart by Rian Malan</h2> <p>Not a history book as such, but a fascinating insight into apartheid South Africa by a young Afrikaner who tried to shed his inbuilt racism but found it central to his identity. As a teenager he scribbled \"Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud\" on walls to proclaim his anti-apartheid credentials. He even slept with a young black girl. But he secretly felt guilty and left South Africa in 1977, shocked at the violence of the Soweto uprising, which he covered for the Johannesburg Star. A beautifully written, searingly honest account of a white South African's struggle with his conscience.</p> <h2>4. The Broken String: The Last Words of an Extinct People by Neil Bennun</h2> <p>The earliest inhabitants of South Africa were bushmen, stone age hunter-gatherers who did not survive the arrival of white settlers. Their extraordinary world of sorcerers, hunters and artists would have been lost for ever had it not been for the efforts of Wilhelm Bleek, a Prussian linguist, and his sister-in-law Lucy Lloyd, who spent 18 years in the late 19th century recording the stories, pictures and personal histories of six of the last bushmen. Neil Bennun's account of Bleek and Lloyd's labour of love, and the remarkable culture they saved for posterity, is superbly told.</p> <h2>5. The Afrikaners by John Fisher</h2> <p>A majestic history of the white settlers of Dutch, German and French descent who dominated South African politics for more than 300 years. John Fisher, a historian and diplomatic correspondent, provides a clear, considered and remarkably objective assessment of who the Afrikaners are and how they came to be there. Published 30 years ago during the apartheid years, it is still the best survey available.</p> <h2>6. The Rise and Fall of the Zulu Nation by John Laband</h2> <p>The history of the 'Black Spartans', from their rise under Shaka to their deliberate destruction by the British in 1879, is neverless than compelling. What this book lacks in storytelling, it more than makes up for with the quality of its analysis and the depth of its research. John Laband, associate professor at the University of Natal, is the senior authority in this field, and his command of Zulu sources is unsurpassed. This enables him to avoid the Eurocentric bias of so many other South African histories, even Donald Morris's. A work of stunning quality.</p> <h2>7. Long Walk to Freedom by Nelson Mandela</h2> <p>Riveting memoir by one of the great moral and political role models of the 20th century, and required reading for anyone interested in a black perspective of the apartheid struggle. In simple, unadorned prose it charts Mandela's extraordinary journey: from his childhood in a small village in the Transkei (where he was the foster son of a Tembu chief), through his 27 years in captivity on Robben Island, and finally to his inauguration in 1994 as South Africa's first black president.</p> <h2>8. Commando: A Boer Journal of the Boer War by Denys Reitz</h2> <p>Rivals the recently reissued world war one classic The Storm of Steel (Ernest Junger) as a war memoir of brutal frankness. The son of a former president of the Orange Free State, Reitz was just 17 when he took part in battle of Spion Kop, a British defeat snatched from the jaws of victory. Reitz played his part, helping to drive the numerically-superior British force from the crest-line and eventually off the hill altogether. Commenting on one particularly bloody skirmish, he wrote \"A fight is a fight\".</p> <h2>9. The Bang-Bang Club: The Making of the New South Africa by Greg Marinovich and Joao Silva</h2> <p>A compelling and honest account of South Africa's transition from apartheid to black majority rule told through the eyes of four young photographers. No punches are pulled as the authors witness at first hand the consequences of the white regime's ruthless attempt to cling on to power by spreading dissension among its black political opponents. Marinovich's account of his Pulitzer prize-winning photograph of a suspected Inkatha member being burned to death by ANC supporters is heartbreaking.</p> <h2>10. Jameson's Raid by Elizabeth Pakenham</h2> <p>The future Lady Longford's groundbreaking study of the famous raid that foreshadowed the Boer War. The raid, into the Transvaal Republic in 1896, was part of a hare-brained scheme by Cecil Rhodes and a group of British-born Johannesburg business leaders to overthrow President Paul Kruger's anti-British regime. Longford provides evidence that the British government, in the form of the colonial secretary Joe Chamberlain, knew about and supported the raid. It failed nevertheless, though its leader Dr Jameson recovered to become prime minister of Cape Province. Despite being Longford's debut book, it's still one of her best.</p>",

  "<p><strong> Poached pears with praline ice cream and chocolate sauce</strong> </p> <p>A seductive contrast of textures here. Silky pears, heavy with syrup, cold, nubbly ice cream and warm, velvety chocolate sauce. One can't help thinking all desserts should be as sumptuous as this. Such decadence would follow pretty much anything - one of the delights of having such a contrast of textures - but it would be particularly soothing after a spicy stew. </p> <p><strong> serves 4</strong><br> <strong>pears - 4<br> golden caster sugar - 2 tbsp a vanilla pod fine, dark chocolate - 200g praline ice cream lemon juice - 1tbsp</strong><br> </p> <p>Pour a good litre of water into a deep, wide pan, add the sugar, vanilla pod and lemon juice and bring to the boil. Peel the pears, tug out their stalks, then halve them and scoop out their cores. Drop them into the sugar syrup and simmer for 10-15 minutes till the pears are translucent and tender. Leave in the syrup to cool. During this time they will become silkily soft and soaked-through with syrup. </p> <p>Get the ice cream out of the freezer. Chop the chocolate. Bring 200ml water to the boil then whisk in the chocolate, removing from the heat as soon as it has melted - a matter of seconds. Place two pear halves on each of four dishes, add the praline ice cream, one ball per person should be ample, then pour over the warm chocolate sauce. </p> <p><strong> Chicken patties with (or without) gorgonzola and rosemary</strong> </p> <p>There are two possibilities here. Either serve the patties as they are, dry-fried in a non-stick pan till golden (in which case serve them with quarters of lemon) or stuff them with blue cheese and bake them instead. Whether you take the simple or the rich route, you end up with the most savoury little 'burgers' imaginable. </p> <p><strong> serves 3-4</strong><br> <strong>a medium onion</strong></p> <p><strong>garlic - 2 cloves<br> butter - 25g cubed pancetta - 100g rosemary - 3 bushy sprigs minced chicken</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> for the optional stuffing:</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>gorgonzola - 75g<br> chicken stock - 250ml</strong><br> </p> <p>Peel the onion and garlic and chop finely, then let them soften and colour lightly in the butter. Stir in the small cubes of pancetta. Strip the rosemary leaves from their stalks, chop finely then add them to the onion mixture, letting them cook for a few minutes till coloured. Let the mixture cool a little. </p> <p>Add the minced chicken and season generously with black pepper and a little salt (the pancetta and gorgonzola will both contribute to the seasoning). Set the oven at 190 c/gas 5. Now, to make the simple patty, shape the mixture into six little burgers, about the size of a digestive biscuit, leave to settle for half an hour, then fry in a non-stick pan for 4 or 5 minutes each side and serve with lemon. Or, if you want something richer, make the stuffed patties. </p> <p>Take a heaped tablespoon of the chicken mixture and push a hollow in it with your thumb. Tip a heaped teaspoon of cheese into the hollow then cover it with a second tablespoon of chicken mixture. Squash gently to form a patty and place on a baking sheet. Continue with this till you have used up the mixture - you will have about six - then refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. </p> <p>Heat up a non-stick frying pan. When hot, brown the patties on both sides, a matter of three minutes on each, then transfer them to an oven-proof dish. Pour in the stock and bake for 25-30 minutes, till the patties are sizzling and the stock is bubbling. Serve two to three patties per person and spoon over some of the hot chicken stock. </p> <p><strong> Baked onions with parmesan and cream</strong> </p> <p>I normally eat these deeply savoury baked onions as a side dish to cold roast beef, and that is probably when they are at their best. But they make a sound main course, too. I eat them and their cheesy sauce with mounds of comforting brown rice, steamed with a cinnamon stick and a couple of cloves. Wet-weather food of the first order. </p> <p><strong> serves 2-3 with rice</strong> </p> <p><strong>onions - 4 medium to large<br> whipping or double cream - 300ml grated parmesan - a good handful<br></strong> </p> <p><strong> to serve:</strong> steamed brown rice for 4 </p> <p>Set the oven at 180 /gas 4. Peel the onions and bring them to the boil in a large, deep pot of water. Leave them at a bright simmer for about 25 minutes until tender. Lift them out with a draining spoon. </p> <p>Slice the onions in half from root to tip and put them cut-side down in an oven-proof dish. Pour over the cream and season with salt, pepper and the grated cheese. Bake for 25 minutes till bubbling. </p> <p><strong> Penne with gorgonzola, walnuts and sage</strong> </p> <p>Supper in 10 minutes: what more could anyone ask on a chilly autumn night? The flavour here is deliberately mild and soothing. The pasta coheres gently with the sauce rather than swims in it. I usually make a chicory salad for afterwards, something crisp and slightly bitter. Even then, all I want to do is to drop off to sleep when I've eaten it. That's what creamy pasta recipes are for. </p> <p><strong> serves 2</strong> </p> <p><strong>300g penne or other small tubular pasta<br> <br>creamy gorgonzola - about 300g<br> <br>walnuts - a dozen or more, freshly shelled<br> <br>a few sage leaves, about six will do</strong> </p> <p> Put the pasta on to cook in a deep pan of generously salted boiling water. Test it throughout the cooking, but it should be ready after about 9 minutes. I like my pasta to have a bit of bite. Drain the penne in a colander, reserving a couple of tablespoonfuls of the cooking water. Put the empty pan immediately back on the stove and turn down the heat to low. Add the cheese and the reserved cooking water, then stir for a minute or less till the cheese starts to melt and you have an impromptu sauce. Tip the pasta back into the pan with the walnuts and sage leaves, then tip onto warm plates. </p> <p><strong> Pot roast pigeon</strong> </p> <p>Nothing fancy this, just a sound pot roast pigeon recipe with classic flavourings and a thick, old-fashioned gravy. You will need some bashed or creamed root vegetables to soak up the copious juice. </p> <p><strong> serves 4</strong> </p> <p><strong>butter - 50g<br> <br>plump, oven-ready pigeons - 4<br> <br>plump, herby sausages - 4<br> <br>a medium to large onion<br> <br>a large carrot<br> <br>celery - 2 sticks<br> <br>a few sprigs of thyme<br> <br>garlic - 2 cloves<br> <br>unsmoked streaky bacon - 4 rashers<br> <br>bay leaves - 2<br> <br>juniper berries - 12<br> <br>plain flour - a level tbsp<br> <br>fruity red wine - 250ml<br> <br>chicken or game stock - 250ml</strong> </p> <p><strong> to serve:</strong> mashed parsnip or potato </p> <p>Melt half the butter in a heavy casserole, then brown the pigeons and sausages lightly on all sides. Lift them out and set aside. Set the oven at 190 c/gas 5. </p> <p>Peel the onion, cut it in half, then slice each half into five from root to tip. Melt the remaining butter over a moderate heat and add the onion. Peel the carrot, cut it into large dice and add it to the onion, together with the chopped celery, 4 or 5 sprigs of thyme and the peeled and sliced garlic. Continue cooking, stirring from time to time. </p> <p>Remove the rind from the bacon and cut each rasher into about six pieces. Stir into the onion and add the juniper berries, lightly crushed, and the bay leaves. Leave to soften, making certain the sausages have the opportunity to colour. After about 20 minutes, the vegetables should be soft and golden. </p> <p>Stir in the flour, let it cook for a few minutes then stir in the wine and the stock. Bring almost to the boil then return the pigeons and sausages to the pan and roast in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, until the pigeons are tender but still lightly pink in the centre. </p> <p><strong> Roast leg of lamb with tomato gravy</strong><br> </p> <p>Late autumn often produces some of the best tomatoes, sweet-sharp and intensely flavoursome. Some spinach and roast potatoes would be good here. </p> <p><strong> serves 6</strong> </p> <p><strong>leg of lamb - 2kg<br> <br>a little olive oil<br> <br>2 whole heads of garlic<br> <br>tomatoes - 750g<br> <br>olive oil - 50ml<br> <br>balsamic vinegar - 50ml<br> <br>several sprigs of oregano</strong> </p> <p>Set the oven at 230 c/gas 8. Rub the lamb all over with a little olive oil. Season the fat and any flesh you can get at with salt and black pepper and lay it in a roasting tin, tuck the heads of garlic, halved and tossed in a little olive oil, under the meat. Roast in the hot oven for 20 minutes. Turn down the heat to 200 c/gas 6 and continue cooking for a further 30 minutes. </p> <p>Cut the larger tomatoes in half and toss them in a bowl with a grinding of salt and pepper, the olive oil, balsamic vinegar and oregano leaves pulled from their stems. When the 30 minutes cooking is up, tip the tomatoes and their dressing around the lamb and continue roasting for a further 25 minutes. </p> <p>Remove the lamb from the roasting tin and leave it to rest, somewhere warm and with a bowl or tea towel over it. This will keep the flesh moist and allow it to relax. Please, don't skip this resting; it will keep the meat much juicier than if you hack at it the second it comes from the oven. </p> <p>Turn the oven up to 230 c/gas 8. Return the tomatoes, garlic and pan juices to the oven and leave them for 10-15 minutes while the meat rests. Take the roasting tin out of the oven, remove about a third of the roast tomatoes and keep them warm. Using a potato masher or draining spoon, squash the remaining tomatoes and the garlic into the pan juices. Tip the the lot into a sieve suspended over a warm bowl or saucepan. Push the tomato pulp through the sieve with a wooden spoon then discard the remains. Check the seasoning of the tomato 'gravy' underneath, and correct it with salt, pepper and balsamic vinegar. I tend to heat it up for a minute, too, but then, I like my gravy really hot. </p> <p>Carve the lamb and spoon and serve with the roasted tomatoes and the tomato gravy. </p> <p><strong> Baked peppers</strong> </p> <p>There is so much sweet juice you will need plenty of bread to mop it up. No need to skin or seed the tomatoes if you are using cherry tomatoes such as Gardeners Delight; this is rustic, rough-edged cooking and will be less interesting if you do. This makes a fine, light lunch with some Taleggio or Robbiolo cheese afterwards. </p> <p><strong> serves 4 as a light lunch</strong> </p> <p><strong>red peppers - 4<br> <br>plump garlic cloves - 3<br> <br>ripe cherry tomatoes - 16<br> <br>olive oil<br> <br>anchovy fillets - 6<br> <br>basil - about 12-16 bushy leaves</strong> </p> <p>Halve the peppers lengthways, tear out and discard the white core and seeds then lay the peppers cut-side up in a baking dish. They should fit snugly. Peel the garlic, slice it finely and put a few slices in each pepper, together with a little salt and a tablespoon of oil. Halve the tomatoes and tuck them in. Bake for 50 minutes at 200 c/gas 6 until the peppers have almost collapsed and are full of juice. Rinse, dry and roughly chop together the anchovies and basil leaves. Stir a spoonful of the basil and anchovies into each of the peppers, return to the oven for 10 minutes, then serve warm or at room temperature with crusty bread. </p> <p><strong> Roast halibut with capers, lemon and parsley</strong> </p> <p>Given a spanking fresh piece of white fish, I sometimes do nothing more to it than rub it with salt and roast it in a very hot oven, its only gilding the juice from a fat Sicilian lemon and a modest pile of lightly steamed spinach. Last time, I got the parsley out too, and a few delectably piquant little capers. This to me is a feast of the first order. You can keep your fancy French sauces. </p> <p><strong> serves 2</strong> </p> <p><strong>halibut steaks - 2 x 225g<br> <br>olive oil<br> <br>salted capers - 2 tbsp<br> <br>flat-leaf parsley - the leaves from a small bunch<br> <br>juice of a large lemon</strong> </p> <p><strong> to serve:</strong> steamed spinach, lemon halves </p> <p>Set the oven at 230 c/gas 8. Warm 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a flame-proof baking dish over a moderate flame. Rub the fish generously with salt and pepper and brown lightly on one side in the hot oil. A minute should suffice. Put the fish into the hot oven and bake for 7-8 minutes until opaque and the flesh parts easily from the bone. </p> <p>Chop the parsley and rinse the capers. Lift out the fish onto warm plates and place the baking dish over a moderate flame. Scatter in the capers and parsley, squeeze in the lemon juice and grind in a little salt and pepper. Drizzle in a little extra virgin olive oil and bring very briefly to a fierce bubble. Tip the lot over the fish and serve. </p> <p><strong> Artichoke soup with ginger and walnuts</strong> </p> <p>This tastes creamy and rich, with only the smallest amount of butter. </p> <p><strong> serves 4-6</strong> </p> <p><strong>large leeks - 2<br> <br>butter - 40g<br> <br>medium sticks of celery - 4<br> <br>Jerusalem artichokes - 400g<br> <br>light stock or water - 1 litre<br> <br>a small bunch of parsley</strong> </p> <p><strong> for the spice-mix</strong> </p> <p><strong>coriander seeds - 1 tsp<br> <br>shelled walnuts - 30g<br> <br>fresh ginger - a 30g lump<br> <br>groundnut oil - 4 tsp</strong> </p> <p>Discard the toughest of the leaves from the leeks then cut into thin rounds. Rinse under running water, then add them with the butter to a heavy saucepan. Let the leeks cook in the butter over a low heat for a good 15 to 20 minutes till they are soft enough to crush between your fingers. </p> <p>Once they have started to soften, you can finely slice and add the celery, then peel and chop the artichokes and stir them in, too. Cover the pot with a lid so the vegetables sweat and soften without colouring, then pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down so the soup bubbles - partially cover with a lid. It will take about 25 minutes for the artichokes to become tender. </p> <p>Grind the coriander seeds to a fine powder with a pestle and mortar, then add the walnuts, mashing them briefly to a pulp. Peel the ginger and slice it thinly, then cut into thin matchsticks. Heat the oil in a shallow pan and fry the ginger for about 30 seconds till it is golden and crisp. Toss in the crushed walnuts and coriander, let them sizzle briefly then tip onto kitchen paper. </p> <p>Blitz the soup through a liquidiser or mouli, stir in the chopped parsley and check the seasoning.

Stir a tablespoon of boiling water into the coffee granules then mix it into the butter-cream. Fold in the walnut pieces. When cool, turn one half of the cake upside down on a plate, spread it with a good third of the butter-cream, then place the second half on top. Spread the remaining butter cream on top and around the sides.</p>",
  "<p>Our table at Per Se in New York was terribly crowded. It wasn't the place setting, which was a model of simplicity: a glass or two, polished to a shine, a knife and a fork each, a flounce of pleated napkin. And it certainly wasn't the table itself, which was a snowfield of crisp, custom-made linen, with room for at least eight elbows, occupied tonight by just the four. </p> <p>It was the memories of all the other truly great meals I have eaten, clamouring around it, as if trying to get a look. It was the memory of the whole black truffle en croute at l'Auberge de l'Ill in Alsace, the eating of which made time stand still; it was the foie gras and crab biscuit and the pigeon pastilla at the Fat Duck in Bray; the Nantucket scallops in their own buttery juices at Craft on the other side of Manhattan; the whole suckling pig shared with friends at St John in London; the first puff of sweet steam from the chocolate and mint souffle at the Champignon Sauvage in Cheltenham, which started it all. </p> <p>And now here I was at Per Se, the new restaurant from Thomas Keller, the legendary chef of the French Laundry in California, itself regarded as the very best restaurant in America, twice named best restaurant on the planet by a panel of experts. Per Se means 'in and of itself' though this venture is nothing of the sort and never can be. The settings may be different - the chrome and glass gilding of the big city here, to the fields and wide open skies of the Napa Valley there - but Per Se and the French Laundry are still each other's siblings. They share the same DNA. Anyone ordering the $150 chef's tasting menu at Per Se would be entitled to expect greatness, to wonder whether they were sitting in what fellow American superstar chef Eric Ripert has already described as 'the greatest restaurant in the world'. Let's put it this way: I was rather looking forward to my dinner. </p> <p>And so it began, all 15 courses of it, though there were many more individual dishes than that, for Keller is famous for his jazz-style riffs on ingredients. Much of the time my companion Simon and I were given the same ingredients or idea, but realised in a different way. So, for example, to start, a fresh and creamy chilled onion soup for me, poured atop a quenelle of minced pickled apples, and for him, a soup of sweetcorn slicked with basil oil. Next, for me, a Keller signature dish called pearls and oysters: a single fat oyster in a rich, oniony sabayon of tapioca - the pearls - with a generous spoonful of caviar; for him (allergic to oysters, poor sap) a cauliflower panna cotta as a foil for the caviar. </p> <p>There are eggs: a soft-boiled hen's egg, with rich black truffle puree and melba toast for me, a white truffle oil-infused custard set in an open egg shell for him. We share a piece of striped black bass, cut to look like a lamb shank for presentation at the table with a sprig of thyme, then filleted and laid on a buttery tangle of roasted endive and almonds. We have the sweetest tails of Nova Scotia lobster, with sweeter garden carrots and peas for me and melted Savoy cabbage for him. There is a truly stunning fillet of Snake River Farm beef, with chanterelle mushrooms and a tiny, exquisite slice of a bread and bone marrow pudding on the side. </p> <p>Now it's time for pudding. I am brought a dish with what looks like a solid, shiny chocolate lid. The waiter sprinkles on crystals of Maldon sea salt and then dribbles very hot olive oil on top. It melts a hole in the middle to reveal a void in the bowl and at the bottom a scoop of delicate thyme ice cream. Simon gets a melting chocolate pudding with a scoop of olive oil ice cream. </p> <p>A sorbet each: one of fragrant hibiscus with an avocado coulis, another of quince with a yogurt panna cotta. Then two further chocolate dishes, one a brownie with coffee ice cream and caramel chocolate croustillant, another a combination of chocolate 'sweetened salty hazelnuts'. </p> <p>And this list is only the highest of the highlights, perhaps less than half of what we ate, all of it coordinated by as cheery and unstuffy a bunch of waiters as you could hope to find. At the end we were brought mint tea. We were offered hand-made chocolates. We were presented with bags of tiny flavoured meringues to take away, in case we were still feeling peckish on the short cab journey home. There were, of course, wines to accompany this: 13 of them in all. We arrived at 8.15pm and we left at a little after 12.30pm. </p> <p>The extraordinary thing about this is that by Per Se standards there was nothing extraordinary about it at all. This is what they do: dinners of 15 tiny courses, each no more than two or three mouthfuls, lasting four or five or even six hours. It's their shtick. So, was it the greatest meal in the world? Was it the best dinner I have ever eaten? Jesus, give me a break! It's only been a week. I'm still digesting. </p> <p>Above the door out of the kitchens at Per Se is an inscription. It reads 'Finesse. Noun: refinement and delicacy of performance, execution or artisanship'. I ask Keller about it when we meet the next day. He looks up at the sign and says simply, 'Life is all about finesse.' It certainly is if you're Thomas Keller. He's sodden with the stuff, has a bearing and poise uncommon among his professional tribe (even wearing his trademark black clogs) and an apparently unshakeable self-confidence. </p> <p>Per Se is situated in the $1.7 billion Time Warner Centre at New York's Columbus Circle on the southern corner of Central Park. It is a massive secular cathedral, glittering with the best retail opportunities money can buy and here nothing comes cheap, certainly not a top-end restaurant. Though his people prefer not to discuss money, it is said that Per Se cost around $12 million to open - very little of it Keller's - making it possibly the most expensive new restaurant on earth. All the crockery, with its hound's-tooth motif, is custom made, as is the linen and the silverware. The floors are of Italian bronzed tiles, the carpets unique, the kitchens unlike any I've ever seen. There might, therefore, be grounds for anxiety. If so, Keller doesn't show it. </p> <p>'If you're really happy with what you're doing does it matter what the critics say?' he asks. 'Or even what the guests say? If we're having a good night in the kitchen the by-product is your happiness.' It is perhaps easier to say this now that Frank Bruni, restaurant critic of The New York Times, has awarded Per Se four out of four stars, and admitted to being 'ineffably sad' at the finishing of a risotto of summer truffles during a meal there. In a city full of top-end restaurants, fewer than half a dozen have the top score. </p> <p>Even so, Keller does not appear to be a man swayed by the opinions of others; he has always followed his own path. Keller, who turns 49 this week, began his career aged just 17 in the kitchens of the Miami country club his mother managed, when the chef quit. For years he worked his way through kitchens in New England and New York, picking lowly jobs in top restaurants over loftier positions in less well-regarded places, before heading to France for a stint at the famed three-star Taillevent. 'Taillevent has been a model for me,' he says now, 'and my kitchen is modelled on that.' In the Eighties he returned to New York and opened Rakel (the name is a combination of his name and that of his then business partner Serge Raoul). It was there, Keller says, that he started developing his food philosophy. 'I reinterpreted the shrimp cocktail so it was true to the flavour profile of the dish but different. So there was a tomato consomme infused with horseradish and we grilled the shrimp and put it all in a highball glass.' </p> <p>Such culinary high jinks enthused the critics, but then came the Wall Street crash of 1987 and business collapsed. Within a few years, Serge Raoul had downgraded the restaurant to a neighbourhood bistro and Keller quit. It wasn't his thing. So he travelled about again, picking up consultancies he hated, and executive positions which didn't suit him. In 1991, while living in Los Angeles, he was told about a restaurant that was for sale in the Napa Valley town of Yountville. 'I went there, saw the French Laundry and somehow knew it was the place I was looking for all my life,' he later said. 'I remember thinking, Yeah, this is home.' </p> <p>He raised $600,000 from dozens of small investors, which he matched with bank loans, and then set to work creating the greatest restaurant in America, a place that would become famed for the hand-rolled cornets of salmon tartar and creme fraiche with which all his meals begin, and his delicate ways with panna cotta or walnut soups and, above all, the supreme quality of his ingredients. In October 1997 Ruth Reichl, then restaurant critic for The New York Times, said the French Laundry was 'the most exciting place to eat in the United States'. The reservation book filled up and stayed filled. </p> <p>Heston Blumenthal of the Fat Duck has eaten at the French Laundry twice. 'It is just possible,' he told me, 'that the best example of precise classical French cooking is not in France but in the United States.' As we talk Keller refers constantly to his 'philosophy' and I ask him to describe it. All his chefs are entitled to create dishes in a way that 'brings out the integrity of the product', he says, but they must 'not be intrusive on another course. There must be no repetition of any one item across a menu.' Really? 'Absolutely. When fava beans come in and I want to use them on a meat dish, someone else can't use them on fish. It pushes our imagination.' It also results in the most extraordinary list of dishes. Most restaurants have a couple of dozen on at any one time. The French Laundry - and now Per Se - has a repertoire of literally thousands. </p> <p>He has even written a declaration of intent for his staff describing the philosophy behind the myriad tasting menus. 'With each course we want to strike quick, mean and leave without getting caught,' he writes, like some Norman Mailer of the stove. 'All menus at the French Laundry revolve around the law of diminishing returns. That is the more you have of something the less you enjoy it.' So lots of tiny courses and lots of intense flavours. 'Imagine one carrot having as much sweet, earthy and fresh characteristic as a pound of carrots or a spoonful of pea soup with the impact of a thousand peas.' I don't need to imagine. I've tried it. </p> <p>In time, the French Laundry spawned a nearby baby brother, Bouchon, and then a bakery, and then another Bouchon in Las Vegas. Next came the approach from Kenneth Himmel, developer of the Time Warner Centre, who wanted to put together the greatest collection of restaurants in the world. He knew he had to have Keller, and Keller in turn was ready to return to New York, to vanquish the demons of Rakel's failure. 'It is part of America,' he says. 'You've got to be ambitious, you've got to move on. I suppose I wanted to find out how hard I could make it for myself and how hard I could be on my staff.' Plus, as an incentive, he was given complete power to choose who else would be in the collection. </p> <p>'It wasn't about wielding that power,' he says. 'It was about making sure we had like minds around us.' One of the criticisms of Per Se is that it is, essentially, a restaurant in a shopping mall. All Keller will say about this is that 'if the Centre succeeds we all succeed' but there is no doubt that he has tried to stack the house in his favour. So the famed Charlie Trotter will open his first restaurant outside Chicago downstairs from Per Se. There's a steakhouse from Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and a Japanese place called Masa offering tasting menus at $240 a pop. The Time Warner restaurant collection is so top end, so damn bling, it hurts. </p> <p>But for a while it was almost dead before it started. A week after Per Se officially opened in February a fire ripped through the kitchen, closing it down for four months. 'We had also closed the French Laundry for four months so we could bring all the staff out here to train up the new lot to send back,' Keller says. 'Now we had no way of training them.' But somehow they got back on track. </p> <p>He takes me into the kitchen, through the 'breezeway', a corridor specially created to give the waiters a chance to adjust from the clatter of the kitchen to the hush of the dining room. He leads me round, introducing chefs, telling me that his job is to make them the best they can be, to pass on leadership skills. The company now has a staff of over 500 across America, a leap from the dozen or so he started with at the French Laundry. At one point he tells me he has acquired an executive coach, and I hope he means he's bought himself a fancy car. But in fact an executive coach is someone who teaches people like Keller how to run large companies. 'It's something I need to be able to do,' he says. </p> <p>Keller clearly loves this management stuff. He shows me the manuals for his employees, hundreds of pages on fish and cheese and meat and how to serve them; the correct way to store ingredients; how to lay tables. And that's before you get to the recipes. All are now online, on a protected website. Soon there will be video link between the French Laundry and Per Se so Keller can see what's going on. </p> <p>They also keep track of thousands of meals, making lists of what many of their key diners have had and when. I am startled. Really? 'Oh yes'. He pulls up sheets of menus from the night before. They even have ours, which he presents me with. This is when the system becomes a little less shiny, reassuringly a touch less professional. For example our two menus mix up a number of the dishes that we had. One course - the cheese - is completely wrong. And there, two courses apart on my menu, is proof that the philosophy of non-repetition doesn't always work in the heat of service. Horror: I was served Cipollini onions twice. I thought it was a neat bit of conscious self-reference. From the look on Keller's face, though, this is clearly a screw up. 'Damn,' he says. 'If I hadn't told you, you wouldn't have known.' </p> <p>Errant Cipollini onions aside, is Per Se the best place to eat dinner on the planet? Was this my greatest meal ever? Is Thomas Keller the best chef in the world? No, no and no. This is not the damning criticism it looks like. When I ask Keller himself how it feels to be described as the best chef in the world he responds repeatedly as if I had asked him what it feels like to be merely 'one of the best chefs in the world.' He says 'I accept my place in that list because enough people have said it. Thing is, I go to work every day just as I have done for 25 years. It's that experience that has made me one of the best.' </p> <p>The problem, as ever, is hype. If Per Se were in France, it would be regarded as a top player. I have no doubt it would have three Michelin stars and Keller would be spoken of alongside the likes of Pierre Gagnaire, Michel Bras and Marc Veyrat. But because he is in the US, he stands proud of the pack. He has to be the biggest, the most accomplished. </p> <p>The truth is that not everything works. The 15-course dinner idea sounds great in principle but, in practice, creates an unmeetable challenge. It is impossible for every course to deliver, and so it proved with our meal. A dish of 'grouper cheek' in a chickpea crust was underwhelming - two so-what fragments of fish goujon. The 'salad' course was some pretty inconsequential ingredients, shepherded together for no good reason. And, as ever in the US, the cheese was just plain lousy.</p> <p>But that is to judge the restaurant by its hype. I will never forget the striped bass dish, or the beef, or the foie gras, or the oysters and pearls or the lobster. And the chocolate dish with the hot olive oil was truly inspired. If my meal had been just those dishes, it may well have been the best I had ever eaten but because of the others it wasn't. Will Thomas Keller care what I think? I doubt it. He's too centred for that, too focused to let my opinion get in the way. And it's exactly this that makes him one of the best chefs in the world.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The French Laundry Cookbook by Thomas Keller is published by Workman at \u00a340.

  "<p>Philip Pullman's story - impoverished diligence rewarded, wildest dreams granted - is a bit of a fairytale, really, so it's no wonder he's keen on them himself. He has already written a version of Puss in Boots, and now his <strong>Aladdin and the Enchanted Lamp</strong> (Scholastic \u00a314.99, pp72), sumptuously illustrated by Sophy Williams, is joining it on the bookshelves.</p> <p>Recently, his accountant put a curious question to him: 'What do you do to enjoy your money?' Pullman looked at him blankly. The idea of enjoying it hadn't occurred to him. On reflection, he realised that the greatest luxury provided by the success of the His Dark Materials trilogy is being able to make everyday purchases without anxiety. He buys books. He shops at Sainsbury's. He pays off the gas bill. These are things he has always done, but no longer has to worry about them.</p> <p>Those who have read and loved His Dark Materials will long for more for him, yet there's a rightness to his modesty, too. Pullman's trilogy, following a scrap of a girl called Lyra as she makes an epic journey through a succession of worlds lit by naphtha, traversed by zeppelins and sledges, and animated by daemons, gypsies and witches, was one of the greatest reading treats I've had in adulthood.</p> <p>While it lasted, life was suspended: pans boiled over, damp laundry rotted and children went unfed. Characters - supernatural or human - are convincingly governed by their own internal logic. Leaving His Dark Materials, with its pace, pageantry and Big Ideas, felt like going into deep mourning.</p> <p>Pullman is a tall, mild-looking man with twin puffs of hair on either side of his skull, Sven-type spectacles and startling grass-green socks. He agrees that retelling a fairy-tale such as Aladdin feels like a little holiday after the rigours of plotting Lyra's adventures.</p> <p>'Being given a story that's already there to tell is like being given a very good car to drive. All the gears work. But it's important not to let these great stories go out of circulation. If the only version of Little Red Riding Hood children hear is Roald Dahl's, when she pulls a gun out of her knickers and shoots them all dead, they're being impoverished. They need to hear the stories pretty straight, not just because they're immensely wonderful, but so that later on they can read the Roald Dahl story and enjoy a twist on the original.'</p> <p>For 12 years, Pullman was an English teacher at a middle school in Oxford, enjoying the nine to 13 age group 'little buds of intellectual curiosity are beginning to open up'. Born in 1943, he spent his childhood on various RAF bases, landed an undistinguished degree and drifted into teaching mainly because he liked the long holidays. It only became a vocation when 'I became passionate about transmitting information and enthusiasm, and telling stories.'</p> <p>Although he'd written and published fiction for both adults and teenagers, it was only when he started freewheeling his way through the Greek myths to fill up the last few minutes of class, and writing the annual school play (a mock penny-dreadful about the Victorian equivalent of Batman), that he got a sense of himself not as a writer, but as a storyteller.</p> <p>'It came from having children in the audience, which forces you to remember that you're telling a story. You're not there to demonstrate how clever you are or your literary style. Children are only interested in what you're telling them. That was a very valuable lesson.'</p> <p>I embarrass Pullman by asking about the blissfulness of falling headlong into Lyra's world, a sensation far more common when reading children's books (such as the Narnia books, the theology of which he finds objectionable) than adult fiction. Pullman has had the experience with two books for grown-ups: Persuasion, and, more recently, Lionel Davidson's Kolymsky Heights, a thriller set in Siberia. Oh yes, I say, of course, it happens with thrillers too.</p> <p>'But you see,' he says, 'genre books and books for children are not very well thought of by literary people. It's as if there's the literary novels and all the rest are fluff under the bed. Since Modernism, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, we suspect stories. We're all clever people now, rather too sophisticated to believe in an omniscient narrator any more.</p> <p>'There's a sort of embarrassment about telling stories. I've noticed it when talking to adult students of creative writing: this awful self-consciousness comes over them, they believe the narrative technique itself has to be foregrounded, or they run the danger of being mistaken for Jeffrey Archer.</p> <p>'Once you get over the clever literary tricks, you can get back to proper storytelling. The value of writing books for children is that they couldn't care less if you're Jeffrey Archer or Dostoyevsky. All they want to know is what happens next.'</p> <p>Last winter's stage version of His Dark Materials is set to return at the National. About A Boy's Chris Weitz has signed up to direct a film version, scripted by Tom Stoppard. All this means that Pullman is finally starting to put together some thoughts about The Book of Dust, the final instalment in what will eventually be the quartet. He won't give much away, but to judge from the clues in Lyra's Oxford, a teaser published last year, there will be a Levantine setting. But it's always a mistake with Pullman to get too hung up on specifics: his geography has little to do with ours.</p> <p>When he found Lyra, he finally found his storytelling voice. It took him ages to write the first chapter of Northern Lights, but after 16 drafts, he was on safe ground at last. 'I'd never written in that tone before. It was sombre, it was cold, and there was a sense of spaciousness. I much prefer to be the omniscient narrator, which is part of the old fairytale tradition and the 19th-century novel tradition: the thing Modernism got away from. Suddenly I had enormous freedom. I didn't expect that. You see, I'm not a fantasy fan. I'm uneasy to think I write fantasy.'</p> <p>I wonder what sort of teacher he was. I can imagine him being rather cool and inscrutable: the unreadable authority figure you want to please. Pullman says he was 'inspirational, which wasn't a good thing. I didn't have a plan, I lived from moment to moment. It depended on what was setting me on fire, really. I was impatient. I wasn't really a good teacher.'</p> <p>It took him a while to work out how to tame a class. 'You mustn't try to be the most popular. That's not your role. The way to control a class is to get the chief girl, or chief boy, interested in what you've got to say. Everyone else will follow them.'</p> <p>After a few years he begin to notice something. Though every child was different, each class was more or less the same, with roles to be filled. Boys' groups are more casual: the smelly one with nits; the clown, who falls off his chair and gets covered with ink.</p> <p>'Then there are the girls, who operate on a very different level. There were two sorts of girls' groups in every class. There was the smart, sophisticated caf\u00e9-society group, much more grown-up than the boys, interested in fashion and make-up. Then there were nice little girls who did their homework and brought you apples and sweets. But these roles were consistent, independent of the individuals.'</p> <p>If the class clown left, within a week someone else would be in that role. There was an invisible template waiting for each new class in September. It could not be resisted. And Pullman himself, which character was he? 'I was the nerdy one who was clever, wished he was sporty so he could belong, but he wasn't.' Well, we all want to be in his gang now, don't we?</p>",
  "<p>International casino operators are preparing to place a \u00a33.5 billion bet on the British public flocking to Vegas-style gambling developments.</p> <p>As a new Gambling Bill is expected to come before MPs this week, it is now clear just how much money casino bosses, mainly from Las Vegas, are prepared to invest if the UK relaxes its strict gaming laws. </p> <p>Seven operators, five from the US and two from South Africa, are behind the \u00a33.5bn investment frenzy. </p> <p>The biggest, MGM Mirage, has confirmed that if all its plans come to fruition it will spend 'in excess of \u00a31bn' building casinos that will contain entertainment complexes as well as 1,250 slot machines with \u00a31m jackpots, and numerous gaming tables. </p> <p>Isle of Capri, another Vegas operator, this weekend said it has struck 'six or so confidential agreements' with sports clubs and landowners and will splash out \u00a3350m. Its executive vice-president Allan Solomon said: 'Britain is the most attractive destination at the moment. We like the work ethic and the British people have a much greater propensity to gamble than in the United States.' </p> <p>The scale of imminent casino investment will present a dilemma for local authorities and regional development agencies who will decide where new regional casinos can go. On the one hand, they will welcome inward investment. But on the other hand, the social consequences could be dire. </p> <p>Government officials and casino bosses believe there will be more than 60 so-called 'regional' casinos, which will have 1,250 slot machines. Leisure industry experts at Ernst and Young this weekend said that in 10 years the full scale of casino development could have brought in as much as \u00a35bn. </p> <p>But there is deep unease among backbench Labour MPs who fear a rapid increase of gambling addiction if, as expected, legislation gets rubber-stamped before the next General Election. </p> <p>Some senior gambling figures have conceded it is 'inevitable' that rates of addiction will rise as more facilities open with gambling products never previously seen in Britain. </p> <p>America's Harrah's, in a joint venture with Gala of the UK, has said it will spend \u00a3600m building eight casinos. Las Vegas Sands, which has confirmed plans to build casinos in Glasgow, Sheffield and West Ham, is understood to want several more sites. Its investment at this stage will be \u00a3210m. Other investors include Caesar's Entertainment, which wants to open a \u00a375m mega-casino in Wembley. </p> <p>Sol Kerzner, the promoter of the Sun City complex in South Africa, plans venues in Manchester, Glasgow and at the Millennium Dome.

Putting him in a box, and never letting him go, is much more cruel, obviously, than chasing him with dogs - which will, as pro-hunting campaigners are ready to explain with varying degrees of patience, either fail to catch him altogether, or kill him efficiently within seconds of catching up with him.</p> <p> Things might have been different if the nursery rhyme had been written about the intensive farming of pigs:<br> We'll grab a sow<br> And put her in a box<br> And never let her go!</p> <p> At least, not until she's had over 100 piglets and is so worn out she can't stand up on her own. And then she'll go for supermarket sausages.</p> <p> It doesn't rhyme (unless you're from Wolverhampton, where I understand 'go' rhymes with 'sow') and the extra line at the end puts paid to the scansion. But it does at least, with reasonable accuracy, describe the business of large-scale pork production. And, had it been it part of our nursery culture, then maybe we'd all now be having a sensible debate about reducing the massive institutionalised cruelty in our intensive farming systems. As opposed to this ludicrously uninformed and hate-fuelled row about foxes.</p> <p> A lot of people I meet seem to think must be enthusiastically, aggressively prohunting - perhaps because I make a TV show which extols (some) of the virtues of country living. I'm not. I can't be that enthusiastic or aggressive about something that I have never been interested in. I don't really get along with horses - either in the field, or on the plate (though donkeys make a nice salami). I did have riding lessons, after school, when I was about eight years old. But they clashed with Scooby Doo and Blue Peter, so I got off to a very resentful start. Then I fell off, bruised my ribs,and refused to get back on.</p> <p> Now the prospect of trying to steer an enormous horse at high speed across ditches and over stone walls fills me with both terror and abhorrence. At the same time I can, from a safe distance, see that it might appeal to some.</p> <p> What I can't see is how any intelligent person who had stopped to think about it for more than a minute could ever consider the wild fox in more urgent need of legislative protection than the factory farmed pig. Compared to the poor pig, which stands or lies on concrete (piled with shit) in such close confinement with hundreds of neighbours that an unnatural inclination is to chew its tail off, the fox is having a whale of a time. Whether he's made his home in the fields and woods, scoffing the squire's pheasants, the baby bunnies, and too many of my chickens, or living it up in the town, feasting on bins and discarded KFCs (in which case I feel sorry for him, but I don't think he feels sorry for himself),he's doing very nicely, thank you.</p> <p> The fact that, once in a while, he has to run the gauntlet of a pack of braying hounds, and risk a quick, though admittedly gory, death, is undeniably a bummer for him - and highly emotive for the human observer. But why, when many millions of other animals are,in the name of human pleasure and satisfaction, enduring so much more misery, throughout their entire lives, has the manner of death of a few thousand foxes become a matter for parliamentary intervention and furious national debate?</p> <p> It might all begin to make a faint glimmer of sense, an almost forgivable kind of well-intentioned, if misguided, moral zealotry, if even one anti-hunting MP (or one furious hunt saboteur,come to that) was saying, 'We just want to sort out the hunting thing first - it's been bugging us for SO long. Then we'll start looking at the pig situation...'</p> <p> But they're not. Instead they're saying shooting will be next. Then fishing. Here are two pursuits I do enjoy, and I do understand. Not least because they have afforded me some of my finest meals.</p> <p> My personal view is that when shooting and fishing are seriously under review, the logical absurdity of a legislated ban will become too gross for all but the really thick, or the really embittered and entrenched, to overlook. I'm certainly prepared to invest a lot of time and energy arguing the point.</p> <p> I mean, how, sensibly, can you ban fishing with a rod and line on the grounds of cruelty, but not ban commercial gill-netting, by which millions of fish take many hours to slowly twist, exhaust and suffocate themselves to death?</p> <p> And isn't it blindingly obvious that the lot of any wild bird,and even the half-wild pheasant reared for shooting, is, even if it meets its end by being blown out of the sky with a shotgun, still infinitely better than that of the factory farmed chicken (see last month's column)?</p> <p> And isn't it most obvious of all, that the quality of an animal's whole life, which will be measured in weeks, months and years, will always be of far greater significance in any ethical assessment of welfare and cruelty, than the manner of its death, which will be a matter of seconds,minutes or,at worst,hours?</p> <p> The problem is, of course, that all manner of cruelty is permissible when animals are being raised and slaughtered for food. It's business, and God forbid that any MP of any party these days be seen to be interfering with that sanctified pursuit. But hang on, aren't hunting, fishing and shooting also businesses? Well, only in the sense that tens of thousands depend on them for their living. I mean they don't actually make anyone seriously rich - at least not in the order of magnitude that might tempt them to make a donation to a political party.</p> <p> But don't fishing and shooting also provide us with food? Some of the best meat you could ever hope to lay your hands on? Or is it just a few weirdos like me who think that way?</p> <p> Relatively speaking, it probably is. But it's becoming ever more clear to me that us weirdos, and the wild meat we insist on making part of our diet,provide one of the last and most vital checks on the relentless intensification of meat production. This is because the mammals and birds we kill with our guns, and the fish we haul out on our hooks, are a vital reminder of where all our meat once came from - and of a natural lifestyle to which we should aspire for all our food animals.</p> <p> Those factory farmed pigs and chickens need us - we are their greatest hope of liberation, if only because we remind our fellow diners that they too were once free. And if ever it becomes illegal to acquire meat by the use of a gun, they, and we, are absolutely stuffed.</p>",
  "<p>In 1925, John Buchan published his second most famous novel, John Mcnab, which tells the story of three metropolitan high-flyers (one is a barrister and former attorney-general, one a cabinet minister and one an eminent banker), each of whom is suffering from an indefinable boredom and lethargy. </p> <p>In order to cure themselves of this ennui, they hatch a plan. Together, they issue a challenge to three Scottish estates: that they will poach from each of them two stags and a salmon in a given time, signing themselves collectively as 'John Mcnab'. 'I suppose I'm stale,' says Lord Lamancha, one of the three. 'But it's a new kind of staleness ... It's simply that the light has gone out of the landscape. Nothing has any savour.' </p> <p>Cut to 2004, when I receive an email from the editor of this magazine in which she asks me, ever-so-casually, if I would like to go deerstalking in Scotland. I, too, am suffering from a kind of ennui. Yes, I am distinctly fed up. More significantly, I've yet to read John Mcnab (that comes later - too late, as it happens). So I scan her missive with mounting excitement. I see myself reclining by a roaring peat fire, glass of whisky in one hand, fat piece of shortbread in the other. As for the actual deerstalking, well, I am an urban girl and somewhat naive about country pursuits. In my mind's eye, I amble gently through a dappled forest. A burn babbles. An eagle soars. On my head is a jaunty tam-o'-shanter. I look - Lord, this is shaming - as though I am shooting an autumn/winter ad campaign for Mulberry. </p> <p>Four weeks later, as I cling to the sodden side of a remote Scottish glen, I remember this feeble fantasy of mine, and blush right down to the roots of my hair (not that anyone is likely to notice - my skin is already so weather-beaten, it might as well be biltong). We have been walking for five hours. I am halfway exhausted. No matter how hard I try, I simply cannot keep up with my guide, Alistair, who scampers over the screes like some tweed-clad mountain goat. It is cold. It is wet. It is misty. I am covered in mud and sheep dung. My ankles ache. The palms of my hands are red-raw. My bum is a giant bruise. Only one thing is keeping me going: the hope that, on my return to London, I can get even with she-who-suggested-I-embark-on-this-folly. That done, I will resume everyday life (my dry, warm, cosy life) with renewed vigour. My ennui, it would seem, is already well and truly cured. </p> <p>To begin at the beginning: yes, people do still deerstalk, and in relatively large numbers. The British Association of Shooting and Conservation, for instance, has 12,000 deerstalkers on its membership (it has about 120,000 members altogether). My trip is to be organised by the Conran group of restaurants and a company called Yorkshire Game, which supplies its chefs with their wild venison. The idea is that the chefs - six of them are to join the party - will get closer to the meat they use, be more inspired by it, more determined to use only the best, by learning everything about the beast: how it lives and, more crucially, how it dies. </p> <p>At the end of a day's stalking, one of the directors of Yorkshire Game, Richard Townsend, will then butcher a deer that has already been hung for 10 days (here's one I made earlier ...), and the chefs, newly blooded and revved-up, will then set about dishing up a venison feast. They will cook every part, bar its pizzle. </p> <p>Our stalk is to take place on one of Scotland's larger estates, the Black Mount, which lies in the west of the country, about two hours' drive north of Glasgow. The Black Mount takes in 90,000 acres of the most impossibly beautiful countryside and is owned - for love, not money, since the vast majority of Scottish estates barely break even - by the Fleming family, who made their money in banking (Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond, was one of their number). There are 3,000 red deer on the Black Mount and, as in the rest of Scotland, they must be culled regularly if they are not to cause serious environmental damage: deer, voracious munchers, strip the land bare. </p> <p>Yorkshire Game takes 500 red deer from the estate each year (it handles around 10,000 red and fallow deer annually, all of which come from Scotland and the North, and has dealings with 30 estates). </p> <p>In the party: Jeremy Lee, head chef at the Blue Print Cafe; Julian O' Neill, head chef at Quaglino's; James Walker, head chef at Le Pont de la Tour; Arnold Ivey, of Orrery; and Frances Moore and John Sarginson, who work at Zinc and the Butler's Wharf Chop House respectively. When we arrive, in the dead of night, at the Black Mount's Victorian hunting lodge, it seems all my reveries have been brought to life. It's Monarch of the Glen meets Sir Walter Scott. There are antlers. There is tartan. There are funny old prints featuring hairy types in kilts. The plumbing is endearingly ancient. More to the point, there is a big fire, a hearty young woman to make us a good breakfast, and a generous hand with the drams. I gaze contentedly around the room. Nothing I can't handle here, I think. The chefs, the estate manager, even Richard from Yorkshire Game, do not look especially lithe to me. I go to bed, dreaming of porridge. </p> <p>Breakfast is taken in the dining room, which has a picture window that overlooks a sea loch and, beyond it, a Trilby-shaped mountain. The weather is stunning: azure sky, Sauternes sunshine, a gentle breeze. I'm just getting stuck into my bacon and eggs when Ben Weatherall, who also works at Yorkshire Game, says: 'You do realise that you're in the eye of the storm, don't you?' I smile, knowingly. 'Seriously,' he says. 'The barometer is forecasting a storm.' </p> <p>Ben, the tallest man I have ever seen, is wearing the most extraordinary outfit: plus fours and a matching jacket in a tweed of duck-egg blue. I, on the other hand, am still in my best Topshop jeans and Neisha Crosland sweater. He looks intimidatingly 'country'. I try to think of something knowledgeable to say - the kind of reply the amateur Yorkshire weatherman Bill Foggitt might have given while sniffing sternly on a piece of seaweed. But, sadly, I am already out of my depth. 'Well,' I tell him, busily buttering toast. 'Barometers do sometimes get it wrong, you know.' </p> <p>The heyday of stalking, in snob terms at least, was in the Victorian era, when the sport was the height of gentlemanly sophistication; stalking is pretty much a Victorian invention. These days, it has rather less cachet - especially compared to, say, a day on a grouse moor. For one thing, it is a relatively inexpensive activity. Bag a brace of grouse, and it will cost you about \u00a3110 (and a decent gun is unlikely to shoot less than 50 brace a day). Stalk a stag, however - and you are likely to bag only one - and it will cost \u00a3275 (hinds, the females, are even cheaper - though, in the case of both grouse and deer, bear in mind that you will have to fork out for accommodation and keeper's or gillie's tips on top). For another, it is not much of a sport for the flashy show-off helicoptered in, hot from his City bank. If you are shooting, the other guns can admire your prowess; it is a social activity. If you are stalking, the only person there to appreciate your skill is the professional stalker, the man who has led you onto the hill. </p> <p>On the other hand, it still feels like an exclusive activity. There is the strangely timeless gear. There is the one-on-one attention. Most important of all, there is the skill involved. A stalker must be fit and agile. He must be quiet and cunning. And he must understand deer, which are pretty elusive creatures. 'A professional stalker is playing three-dimensional chess,' says Jonathan Young, editor of the Field. 'It takes ability to outwit the deer. So one feels this tremendous pressure not to let the stalker down. The sense of achievement is enormous.' </p> <p>Young wishes more people would take up stalking, a view shared by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. In Scotland, there are between 450,000 and 600,000 wild deer. Simply for these numbers to stand still, 25-30 per cent of the population must be culled each year. (Incidentally, the stag season lasts from 1 July to 20 October, the hind season from 21 October to 15 February. Males and females live separately, except during the rut, which is in September. At this time, when the stags roar spookily in the mist, the quality of venison is poor; a rutting stag is far too busy to eat.) </p> <p>The Black Mount estate employs three full-time stalkers. It takes me a while to get over their look, for they might have wandered straight out of John Mcnab or, more likely, the BBC's costume department. They are in green tweed waistcoats and plus fours, they carry telescopes in conker-leather cases and, on their heads are genuine deerstalker hats. Surely someone is having a laugh. But no: this is deadly serious. My posse, to be led by the head stalker, Alistair, consists of yours truly, Richard Townsend, Jeremy Lee and Murdo, The Observer's photographer. After checking that we have our 'pieces' (sandwiches) in our pockets, Ali tells us that we must stay behind him at all times, and follow as precisely in his footsteps as we possibly can. 'If I crouch, you crouch,' he says (he is a real Mellors type - dishy, but reticent). 'If I lie down flat, you lie down flat.' Richard looks at me rather pointedly. 'And that goes for wherever you happen to be,' he adds. 'Even in water.' </p> <p>It turns out that Weatherall was right. Or, as Buchan would have had it: the gods of the sky are in capricious mood. We have been walking for about half an hour when the fog descends and wraps itself like (Buchan again) a 'wet tablecloth'. The hill - the Trilby-shaped mountain that looked so serene over fried eggs and bacon - looms ahead of us, 'rough with boulders and heather, and broken with small gullies, and on its face a man might readily lose himself'. Every so often, Ali stops, dead in his tracks. Then he scans the skyline with his telescope. </p> <p>It is a bloody good job he has to do this. If it were not for these pauses, I would long since have been left behind ... to DIE. The hill is steep and pitted with unseen places where the novice might very easily turn an ankle or - God forbid - break a leg. How on earth do he and Richard traverse this terrain with such dextrous ease? To watch them, they might as well be strolling across some seaside winter garden. </p> <p>This goes on for hours. Some way ahead of us - some miles ahead of us - is a group of around 30 deer that includes three stags of suitable age for culling. But every time we edge towards them, they edge nonchalantly away. </p> <p>It would, I think, be easier to hold a conger eel tight in the palms of your hands than catch this lot. Jeremy and I are now a long way behind the others, and in very low spirits. At one point, he takes my hand. I know he has done this, because I can see that he has. But I certainly can't feel it. My fingers are like frozen sausages. </p> <p>'Courage!' I say (a bit camply). He puts his hand to his brow, in the manner of a tragic consumptive. We press on, trying hard not to dislodge the scree (which would alert the deer to our presence). A few moments later, we bump into Richard. I'm aware that an attractive dewdrop has formed on the end of my nose. 'Are you having a bad hair day, Rachel?' he asks. Forget the stag: it is now him I want to kill. </p> <p>The end, when it comes, is swift. Realising that the direction of the wind is about to change - our game would then be up because the deer would smell us - Ali decides that he and Richard will go ahead alone. Jeremy and I are just too slow, too much of an encumbrance. So we sit, quietly, humbly, and wait for the sound of a shot to ring out. </p> <p>When it does, we leap up, and slide down the hill - the great thing about the waterproof trousers that I am wearing is that you can toboggan in them when the grass is wet - to see our (sorry, their) catch. It is - this may sound bloodthirsty - a splendid sight. The stag, killed by a single shot to its heart, is mature, and probably weighs about 17 stone. But its antlers are uneven, mismatched; it is not, therefore, the kind of animal whose genes Ali wishes to be passed on. I reach down and touch its hide. The beast is already growing cold. I know how it feels. </p> <p>Next, my Lady Chatterley moment. Believe me when I tell you that a funny feeling creeps over you when you see a handsome man in fine tweeds roll up his sleeves, take out his hunting knife, and set about his strange, bloody butchery high on a mountainside. The word that springs to mind is ... earthy. </p> <p>A stag is always gralloched (has its stomach and intestines removed) before the carcass is taken down the mountain (in the old days, this was done by pony; now, it is done on a brilliant amphibious vehicle called an Argocat). </p> <p>First, Ali runs his knife along the beast's belly. Then, he shoves his hands deep inside the animal, yanks out the relevant bits, and spreads them across the hillside as carrion. Above us, a large black bird has already started to circle. Weak and worn out, I look up at it and I wonder: has it come for Bambi's stomach or is it after me? </p> <p>Ali radios to his gillie, who is waiting at the bottom of the hill and, 45 minutes later, Will appears, roaring towards us in the tiny but stubborn Argocat: a surreal moment. We put our stag in the back, and I jump in the front with Ali. The journey to the bottom of the glen is more than bumpy - I feel like I am shooting a scene from Platoon - but it is damn sight better than walking, and the engine warms my bottom quite toastily. En route, we pass poor Jeremy, who left us a while ago on (blistered) foot. </p> <p>Somehow, we manage to squeeze him in. I am glad about this. It makes me feel better about having secured my own berth so girlishly. As dusk falls, we arrive back at the lodge. I eat two pieces of shortbread and drink two cups of tea while still standing up, and I feel pretty proud of myself until I learn that the other two parties have been back - with stags - for two hours. Worse, in these groups, the amateurs did the kill. Time for a hot bath, I think. </p> <p>That night, the chefs set about cooking the venison in the lodge's Aga. They dish up a real feast: liver, kidney, some wonderful pink medallions. Venison is a low-cholesterol meat but, when wild, it tastes delicious: better than beef, I think. Yorkshire Game pays about \u00a31.30 per kilo for the meat; a restaurant, however, will cough up nearer \u00a38.50 for the better cuts, such as saddle. Around a drunken dinner table, the consensus is that stalking is a Good Thing (though there is some amazement at the effort involved in procuring the meat the chefs ordinarily take so for granted). </p> <p>All the men, especially James, whose face is still smeared with the blood of his stag, would stalk again, given half a chance. Even Jeremy is going on about the grandeur of the mountain. Deluded fools! For my part, I am just relieved that I am not still out there in the dark, bleeding and bruised and lost. I go upstairs long before the others, take three Nurofen, and fall into an exhausted slumber. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Conran chefs visit to Black Mount Estate was hosted by Yorkshire Game (<a href=\"http://www.yorkshiregame.co.uk\">www.yorkshiregame.co.uk</a>).

  "<p>Bashing the British film industry has long been a national pastime, along with moaning about the weather and worrying about the sex lives of politicians. Back in the Thirties, Ken Russell's mother famously used the phrase 'a British picture' to refer to films which were drab and dreary - the very opposite of her offspring's subsequent creations. In his foreword to The Encyclopedia of British Film, The Observer 's own Philip French recalls that in the Fifties film fans 'were not encouraged to like British cinema ... indeed, we were urged to disparage it as socially and artistically inauthentic'. More recently, the iniquities of British film financing (which have left Terence Davies struggling to get funding while Sex Lives of the Potato Men received Film Council assistance) prompted the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw to declare: 'The urgent debate for our native film industry seems to be as follows: should we put the gun barrel to our temples, or in our mouths for a cleaner kill?' </p> <p>Yet unlikely as it may seem, there is currently an unfashionably buoyant air about contemporary British film-making - if not within the industry, then at least as far as audiences are concerned. </p> <p>According to the box-office charts, UK film-goers are shunning Hollywood fodder in favour of watching Paul Bettany bat balls around Centre Court in Richard Loncraine's romantic comedy Wimbledon, or seeing Daniel Craig walk moodily through London's mean streets in Matthew Vaughn's stylish thriller Layer Cake. At the grittier end of the market, Shane Meadows' guerrilla-style indie-pic Dead Man's Shoes ('Mad Max comes to the Midlands') recently opened to rave reviews, mix ing Western lore and local horror to breathe new life into big-screen revenge dramas. Among this week's new releases is Bride and Prejudice, in which Gurinder Chadha puts a Bollywood spin on the Jane Austen classic in what promises to be a crowd-pleasing cross-cultural romp. Meanwhile, Trainspotting director Danny Boyle spent last Thursday in the company of an enthusiastic young audience at a National Schools Film Week preview screening of his forthcoming Millions - a Frank Cottrell Boyce-scripted fable about two young brothers, a bag of money, and an entire company of saints, which defies genre categorisation. </p> <p>Among the many promising Brit-films on the horizon is Frozen, a tale of a woman's search for her missing sister which boasts a long-awaited leading role for actress Shirley Henderson, whose career seems to embody the current diversity of film-making in Britain. Since an early appearance in Trainspotting (the movie which spearheaded a 'new wave' of Brit-pics back in the Nineties), Henderson has lent her mer curial presence to a string of high-profile home-grown features such as Shane Meadows's English Western Once Upon a Time in the Midlands, and Michael Winterbottom's edgy Madchester satire 24 Hour Party People. </p> <p>But her CV includes memorable appearances in such mainstream fare as Bridget Jones's Diary and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, internationally financed movies adapted from quintessentially English source novels, shot on location here in the UK, but tailor-made to woo worldwide audiences. </p> <p>Like so many great British actors, Henderson has also worked with Mike Leigh (she had a supporting role in Topsy Turvy), whose highly anticipated new movie Vera Drake won the top prize at this year's Venice Film Festival. A Fifties-set period drama dealing with the controversial subject of abortion, it stars Imelda Staunton in the title role, and features strong support from the likes of rising star Eddie Marsan, who shone in the neo-noir thriller Gangster No 1, which I consider to be one of the most underrated British films of recent years. </p> <p>Whether this all adds up to a sustainable upswing in the fortunes of the British film industry remains to be seen. David Puttnam recently told me that he had once advised budding film-makers to 'go make a couple of horror movies' to learn their trade - low-budget fright-films being pretty much guaranteed not to lose money. This, of course, was back in the days when Britain was a proud exporter of world-beating horror and comedy films, unashamed genre movies which made a profit despite an often sniffy press response. </p> <p>It's no surprise that in the international marketplace British talent is represented most successfully in comedies like Roger Michell's Notting Hill, Richard Curtis's Love, Actually, and Wimbledon. Personally, I think it's also significant that horror films seem to be on the rise again in the UK, with directors such as Marc Evans exploring the boundaries of the genre in My Little Eye and Trauma, and controversial artists the Chapman brothers planning a big-screen fright-fest inspired by their love of classic British shockers such as Deathline and Don't Look Now. </p> <p>Heartening, too, that the eclectic romantic comedy/zombie-horror ('zom-rom-com') hybrid Shaun of the Dead has won fans not only here but also over in the US, where it's currently at Number 6 in the box-office charts. After the dog days of dodgy Brit-pics such as Rancid Aluminium and Love, Honour and Obey, perhaps UK film-makers - and audiences - have a reason to laugh, cheer and even scream again.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Tom Hardy, actor </strong><br> 'I've done 11 films, five plays and two TV shows pretty much back to back in the last two years.' Since he was taken out of drama school to star alongside Tom Hanks in Band of Brothers, Tom has appeared in Black Hawk Down and Star Trek Nemesis. He can be seen most recently in Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake. When we manage to drag him away from his mate Rhys Ifans at The Observer shoot Tom explains how he got into acting. 'I was vetted in subtlety by demons into the cosmos. That and I've always been a liar so it seemed like a good opportunity to get into it professionally.' Does he feel like he's in the middle of a hot British cinema renaissance? 'To be honest, I wouldn't know \"hot\" if it poked me in the eye, but I'm very happy and I love my craft.' <br><strong> JC</strong> </p> <p><strong>Rhys Ifans, actor </strong><br> When the government poured lottery cash into the British film industry in 1997, Rhys Ifans seemed to be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Suddenly, he was everywhere. 'I was ravenous,' he admits, rolling the word out with Welsh relish. 'I took too many parts. But during that lottery gold rush scripts went into production three drafts too soon. The work is more honed nowadays.' Though his remarkable debut in Twin Town was followed by disasters such as Rancid Aluminium, Janice Beard 45 wpm and You're Dead, Ifans became internationally famous almost overnight as Spike, the dirty underpants-wearing flatmate of Hugh Grant's character in Notting Hill. He's not exactly proud of how that performance has overshadowed his career but this month's Enduring Love - adapted from the Ian McEwan novel - finds him reunited with that film's director, Roger Michell. 'I think I've got better as an actor since those days. I've accumulated more experience and had a more diverse range of roles, so I bloody should have.' <br><strong> JS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Annie Griffin, writer-director </strong><br> Annie Griffin spent the summer running around Edinburgh with a film crew during the festival making her directorial debut, Festival, which will be released next year. Twenty years ago, the American-born Griffin starred in student productions at the Fringe and she thought it was time someone put the backstage drama on screen. 'I'm amazed that it hasn't been seen on film before, but more calculatingly, I thought there was no way they could delay this film because it had to be filmed during the festival!' After acting for a while, Griffin began making short films for MTV, learning the ropes. Her big break came with C4's The Book Club, the offbeat comedy she created about a reading group. 'Making films is not going to turn my head. A lot of people want to be directors for the wrong reasons, rather than because they want to make films,' she says. <br><strong> AO</strong> </p> <p><strong>Kevin Loader, producer </strong><br> </p> <p>He's the king of adaptations and having worked his magic with The Buddha of Suburbia and Captain Corelli's Mandolin is now busy with Ian McEwan's Enduring Love. McEwan has been closely involved and was present for the filming of the infamous opening chapter. 'He was deeply affected by it - standing in this field watching a man dangling from a red balloon. You could see him thinking, \"Wow, it looks as beautiful and disturbing as I'd imagined.\"' While adapting is Loader's forte, he also worked with long-time collaborator and partner Roger Michell on 2003's original screenplay The Mother. His ultimate project, he says, would be an adaptation of Maupassant's Bel-Ami. <br><strong> JC </strong> </p> <p><strong> Sophie Okonedo, actress </strong><br> I see myself as a character actress, actually I'm a characterful leading actress,' laughs Sophie Okonedo. She can laugh because she used to be cast in quirky supporting roles but over the past couple of years she has emerged in starring roles. She will soon appear with Don Cheadle in Hotel Rwanda, a powerful drama about the civil war. At the moment she is filming Aeon Flux, a sci-fi movie alongside Charlize Theron. It was her performance as a sharp-witted prostitute in Stephen Frears's Dirty Pretty Things that got Hollywood's attention, a rare achievement for a black British woman in Hollywood. She initially wanted to be a writer and joined Hanif Kureishi's workshop only to discover she was better at reading than writing the parts. Rada followed, then steady employment on stage and screen. <br><strong> AO</strong> </p> <p><strong> Ashley Walters, actor </strong><br> </p> <p>Although he is better known for being in the So Solid Crew, Ashley Walters has been acting 'in adverts and the theatre since I was four'. He is now the star of Bullet Boy , a coming-of-age drama set on Hackney's 'murder mile'. Five years ago, BBC viewers saw his potential in Lenny James's autobiographical Storm Damage when he played a teenager struggling to stay on the right path. Walter's own life took a detour when he joined the notorious south London garage crew, a tumultuous period that ended when he was sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders institute for illegal possession of a firearm. 'There was a lot of pressure and responsibility on me,' he says. 'It took me a while to recognise that and I'm still learning.' Interestingly, Walters plays a young man newly released from prison in Bullet Boy. In fact, the prison scenes were set in the Onleigh YOI in Rugby, where he served his time. They even filmed him in the same holding cell. 'It felt weird, although it was good being in there and knowing I could leave anytime I wanted.' <br><strong> AO</strong> </p> <p><strong> Amma Asante, director </strong><br> Remember the class of 1985, when Zammo was going out with Jackie, Fay was in the sixth form and poor old Ro-land was the fat kid? In the heyday of Grange Hill, Amma Asante played Cheryl Webb. 'We were supposed to be from Grenada but I always remember there was a calendar of Dominica on the wall.' Her directorial debut, A Way of Life, took three years to realise. Amma initially only wanted to write the script and, while searching for a suitable director, the Film Council sent her on a cinema training course. When she returned, there was only person who could see the project to its natural conclusion. 'Directing had always seemed so hard, so much bother,' she says. 'Making my film has demystified the process for me and I've learnt that it's like a lot of things in life - you just have to get on with it.' <br><strong> JS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Saul Dibb, director </strong><br> </p> <p>Directing his first feature film, Bullet Boy, was a test for Saul Dibb after a decade spent making documentaries.'I wanted to use actors who could adapt their personal experiences to the roles,' he says. 'But I didn't want to come up with a film that felt like a documentary. There's a difference between naturalness and naturalism. I'm not sure anyone really cares when they read in the newspaper that another 17-year-old has been shot,' says Saul. 'So I wanted people to put themselves in the shoes of someone who was affected by it and to see the human side of what lies behind the statistics.'The day after our interview, Dibb attended a screening of Bullet Boy specially arranged for the Home Office. 'I don't believe films change things these days, but they can help outsiders better understand the problems.' <br><strong> JS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Natascha Wharton, producer </strong><br> </p> <p>Global hits such as Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary and Love Actually gave rise to a rare situation at Working Title - a UK company created specifically to develop domestic talent. WT\u00b2 was set up five years ago to encourage more experimental British projects on smaller budgets. Yet the first film it produced was another mega-hit, Billy Elliott. 'That film's been both a blessing and a curse,' admits head of WT\u00b2 Natascha Wharton with hindsight. 'It put us under pressure to reproduce that kind of magic every time but that wasn't what we were set up for and it isn't exactly easy.' Nevertheless, Wharton has quickly become a crucial figure for UK film-makers. Approval from her means your script is likely to get made and the unique WT\u00b2 relationship with US studio Universal means the result is even likely to get seen. The golden touch can currently be seen working for Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead which now nestles in the Top 10 of the American charts. Wharton says she has detected a gradual change in the culture. 'There are more courses, more classes, more education about film than when we began, and I see directors and writers from a generation more steeped in cinema,' she says. <br><strong> JS</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Shirley Henderson, actress </strong><br> </p> <p>She's our hardest-working actress, able to combine blockbuster franchises Bridget Jones and Harry Potter (her ghostly Moaning Myrtle was the best thing about HP2) with indie art films. So it comes as a surprise that Juliet McKoen's Frozen is Henderson's first-ever lead. She plays a young woman unable to come to terms with her sister's disappearance. Henderson grew up in Fife, studied at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and combines ethereal beauty with gritty realism. She has five new films to promote this year and is about to start filming Michael Winterbottom's Tristram Shandy. Multiplex glory beckons this Christmas when she reprises Jude in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, but one of her most interesting roles will be in Sally Potter's new film Yes where Henderson plays a cleaner working for a rich American couple, Joan Allen and Sam Neill. 'There's supposed to be an extraordinary sex scene in Yes,' calls out Danny Boyle, on our shoot. Seeing Henderson's look of incomprehension, he grins. 'Clearly you aren't in it!' <br><strong> LH </strong> </p> <p><strong> Asif Kapadia, director </strong><br> </p> <p>Last year, the British-born Asian writer/director stole the limelight at the Baftas, when his debut film, the medieval Indian parable, The Warrior, picked up two awards. In many ways the making of a foreign-language film with subtitles, shot in Hindi in the desert in northwest India with no stars, was a minor miracle. It cost \u00a35 million to make. 'We had 260 people in the crew who were a mix of Muslims, Hindus and Christians. We had a lot of gods on our side.' Kapadia is a first-generation child of Indian parents. During his MA in film at the Royal College of Art, he made the short film, The Sheep Thief , which won the Cinefoundation for best student film at Cannes in 1998 and funding to get The Warrior made. With three scripts ready to go, Kapadia is itching to shoot his next movie. 'It's similar in tone to The Warrior - very little dialogue, very visual, and I'll be using the same team. It's set in the Arctic.' <br><strong> LH</strong> </p> <p><strong> Danny Boyle, director </strong><br> </p> <p>His last film, zombie thriller 28 Days Later, became the most successful British-made independent movie ever at the US box office. So what is Danny Boyle doing making a small-budget British movie - aimed at a crossover audience of adults and children - set in Manchester? Millions is based on a script by Frank Cottrell Boyce. It follows two kids who find millions of pounds from a bank robbery but have just days to spend it before Britain converts to the euro. Boyle is one of our most maverick - and modest - directors. ('They always call me when Ken Loach drops out,' he says.) He worked in theatre and TV until his 1994 cinematic debut, Shallow Grave , followed by Trainspotting. His reputation dipped with Hollywood outings A Life Less Ordinary and The Beach, but 28 Days Later was a wakeup call to great British film. Boyle says that Millions is a feel-good retelling of Shallow Grave - but through a child's eyes. 'Let's face it, every American film is a gun-and-a-girl or a bag of money film!' <br><strong> LH</strong> </p> <p><strong> Luke Mably, actor </strong><br> </p> <p>He's getting electrifying reviews for the role of Christian in Festen, the West End play based on the Dogme film, but Mably is also one of our most interesting young screen actors. After playing soldier Clifton in Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, Hollywood hand-picked him to star opposite Julia Stiles in The Prince and Me. His next role is in the much-anticipated Colour Me Kubrick with John Malkovich. 'It's based on this amazing true story of a man who used to go around London posing as Stanley Kubrick. He was a con man who picked up gay boys in bars and promised them the world.' He's just completed horror flick Spirit Trap with Dougray Scott and Billie Piper in Prague. 'I really want to mix things up. I was originally playing the hero but then thank heavens they recast me as the psychopath ...' <br><strong> LH</strong> </p> <p><strong> Pawel Pawlikowski, director </strong><br> </p> <p>Not many British film-makers claim their biggest influence is 19th-century Russian literature. In fact, only the director of a film as singular and delicate as his forthcoming My Summer of Love could get away with it. In his teens Pawel Pawlikowski was brought from Warsaw to England in 1977 by his ballerina mother. He worked in the mid-1980s in the BBC's music and arts department. 'There were programmes like Arena and Bookmark which would let you make a film from the barest sketches of an idea. The people who worked there are now making interesting cinema. But, of course, like with most good things in this country, that situation is now gone.'He's a one-off, as the individual style of his striking first feature, Last Resort, suggested. <br><strong> JS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Tanya Seghatchian, producer </strong><br> </p> <p>Tanya Seghatchian met Pawlikowski at the BBC more than 10 years ago and recognised 'an inspirational spirit', she recalls. It has taken more than a decade for them to finally work together on the big screen, mainly because the 37-year-old Londoner's life has been taken up with Harry Potter. It was her idea to option the books, taking them to another producer, David Heyman. 'I've worked with Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Newell and now Pawel,' she says. 'There's no point being a producer unless it's for a director you really like. In the role, you're protector and nurse, so you have to believe in it when everyone is doubting it.' <br><strong> JS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Damien O'Donnell, director </strong><br> </p> <p>Few directors strike it lucky with their first film, but Damien O'Donnell's East is East gave him a debut hit. The Irish director was attracted to the comedy about the fortunes of an Asian family because 'I grew up in a big working-class family and it felt familiar'. Although his follow-up Heartlands didn't make the same impression, his latest film, Inside I'm Dancing, about the friendship between two young disabled men has broad appeal. O'Donnell attracted criticism for not casting disabled actors, but he is unrepentant. 'The important thing is do you believe those characters in that world. I thought that to reduce those characters to their physicality was a retrograde thing.' <br><strong> AO</strong> </p> <p><strong> Juliet McKoen, director </strong><br> </p> <p>Having won the Kodak/Bafta Short Film prize for her film Mavis and the Mermaid, she began work on her full-length debut, Frozen. Starring Shirley Henderson and Roshan Seth, the film is shot in Morecambe Bay and tells the story of Kath, who struggles to understand the disappearance of her sister two years earlier. McKoen wrote the screenplay after the body of the 'lady in the lake' was discovered in 2000 near her home in Cumbria and though it is not based in fact, 'it is in homage to the hundreds of women who disappear each year... Landscapes inspire me to tell stories and I'm interested in the link between them and human emotions.' <br><strong> JC </strong> </p> <p><strong> Eddie Marsan, actor </strong><br> </p> <p> 'I look like a Mike Leigh character in real life, don't I?' laughs Eddie Marsan. 'I'm a funny-looking bloke.' But in Vera Drake, Marsan is much more than that, giving an eye-catching performance. Despite his admitted physiological suitability for it, this was Marsan's first experience of working with Leigh. 'I learnt so much doing it that I feel like my career has just started.' Gangster No 1 featured perhaps his most notable film role but you can spot him in Hollywood productions including Gangs of New York and 21 Grams, as Benicio del Toro's priest. <br><strong> JS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Anne Dudley, composer </strong><br> </p> <p>When Anne Dudley turned up for The Observer photoshoot last week, she wasn't the most famous face in the room, but she was the only one with an Oscar standing on a shelf at home. She won it for writing the score for The Full Monty. The classically trained musician began her career with Trevor Horn and Paul Morley in The Art of Noise. Her work includes scores for Neil Jordan's The Crying Game and Stephen Fry's Bright Young Things. But the quality of the films isn't an issue for her. 'It doesn't really bother me. I put the same emotional intensity into whatever I do.' <br><strong> AO</strong> </p> <p><strong> Marc Evans, director </strong><br> </p> <p> 'I like making films that I'd like to see myself,' says Marc Evans. 'I like watching dark films and I'm attracted to that kind of material.' It makes you wonder what is in his DVD collection. Evans has directed four films, all of them mix elements of horror and chilling psychology. His biggest hit to date, My Little Eye, took the concept of the reality television show to frightening new levels as a group of teenagers living in an isolated house are killed one by one. The Welsh director's latest film, Trauma, was less successful but his next will be his most ambitious yet, with Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver starring in Snow Cake as a drifter and a high-functioning autistic who begin a relationship. 'In every film I've made, at the end somebody dies and somebody walks,' he says. 'But this one will finish a bit more hopefully.' <br><strong> AO</strong> </p> <p><strong> David Morrissey, actor-director </strong><br> </p> <p>Having appeared in acclaimed TV dramas such as The Deal, Clocking Off and State of Play, Morrissey has now turned his attention to directing. With a few short films already under his belt - including Bukowski's Bring Me Your Love - and Sweet Revenge for the BBC, Morrissey is ready to move on to something more substantial. Morrissey's ideal project is an adaptation of his wife Esther Freud's novel The Wild, but at the moment it's still at the fundraising stage. It might be helped by the success of L'Homme du Train for Morrissey's production company Tubedale last year. He is currently shooting a new film about Rolling Stone Brian Jones and is shortly to start filming Derailed with Jennifer Aniston. <br><strong> JC</strong> </p> <p><strong> Matthew Vaughn, producer-director </strong><br> </p> <p> 'Everyone thought I was mad when I told them I wanted to direct,' says Matthew Vaughn. 'Everyone except Claudia.' So, encouraged by the support of his supermodel wife Claudia Schiffer, the producer-turned-director got to work. The result, Layer Cake, is better than the gangster films (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) he produced for his mate Guy Ritchie and is doing well at the box office, too. The 33-year-old says: 'If I can find a big film and stay in Britain, that would be great. But it would have to be an amazing film to lure me to America. I spent a couple of years there once and hated it.' <br><strong> AO</strong> </p> <p><strong> Sally Hawkins, actress </strong><br> </p> <p>With two vastly different roles in Layer Cake and Vera Drake, actress Sally Hawkins is having a good autumn. The Rada-trained actress says making the two films could not have been more different. 'Matthew Vaughn was very caring, very attentive, which surprised me. I don't know why - I had it in my head that he'd be some sort of lad.' Of Mike Leigh, she says: 'You never get used to working with him,' she says. 'I was glad to become part of his company, though, because he tends to use you again and again. You have to be on your toes every second. This time I was improvising with Lesley Manville and Imelda Staunton, two total heroes to me.' <br><strong> JS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Roger Michell, director </strong><br> </p> <p>When you've directed such a massive international hit as Notting Hill, the film world is your oyster. Roger Michell has simpler goals. 'I want to make films here,' he says. 'If I don't have to go out of north London, even better.' He's only half joking. Scouting locations for Captain Corelli's Mandolin, Michell suffered a heart attack and had to withdraw from the project. 'We have everything you need to make wonderful films here,' he says. 'What we don't have is big stars and big studios, people you can bank on at the box office and institutions with the financial stamina to roll with the punches. That's what really sustains an industry.' Enduring Love is released next month, but Michell insists on doing at least one theatre project per year. 'It's a short commitment - say six weeks - you work directly with actors and there's little fuss compared to a movie.' <br><strong> JS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Beeban Kidron, director </strong><br> </p> <p> 'It was like taking care of a national treasure,' says director Beeban Kidron of her experience in charge of Bridget Jones:The Edge of Reason. The new film is, she hopes, 'faithful to the spirit of the original, but not to the style'. Kidron, 43, is still, perhaps, best-known here for the award-winning TV adaptation of Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in 1990. She followed that with a small feature, Antonia and Jane and suddenly found herself in Hollywood. Used People saw her directing Shirley Maclaine and Marcello Mastroianni. Her next, To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar, is famous as the hardest ever title in charades and for having Wesley Snipes in drag. Beeban says whatever the success of Bridget, she's back in Britain for good. 'I can juggle far more easily here at the moment, doing TV films, documentaries and world-class films with big casts. As a director, you can't ask for more than that.' <br><strong> JS</strong> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Profiles by Jenny Clover, Jason Solomons, Akin Ojumu and Liz Hoggard </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> With thanks to Covent Garden Hotel, London WC2, Framestore/CFC and the BFI</p>",
  "<p>The Victorians were prolific master builders. They are estimated to have doubled Britain's housing stock, which is why the Victorian terraced house is as common a feature in our towns as the postwar semi. And equally popular, according to London estate agency Barnard Marcus, because of their space and substance. </p> <p>Having recently fallen in love with a small Victorian gem built in the mid-1800s with cute cornices, (we were gazumped, but that's another story) I have become interested in how you decorate a Victorian home. </p> <p>Defining the style isn't easy. There were so many during Victoria's reign. Research fellow Suzanne Fegace Cooper, of the Victoria and Albert Museum, sees Victorian style in terms of design reactions to burgeoning industrialisation. </p> <p>'They were reacting in two ways, against it with the Arts and Crafts and aesthetic movements, as well as Gothic and Japanese styles. But there was also a real excitement about industrialisation and technology. They had new processes such as press- and steam-moulding or papier mach\u00e9. It was the Victorian equivalent of plastic, used for everything from tea trays and cradles to large pieces of furniture.' </p> <p>The virtues of steam-moulding included its ability to give objects any colour, shape and appearance, such as the lacquer-work effect in black and gold. As Fegace Cooper says, it was 'cheap and cheerful'. </p> <p>So where do you start? If you have original features, it is nice to go the authentic route. The Victorian Society, co-founded by Pevsner and John Betjeman among others, has an excellent website (<a href=\"http://www.victoriansociety.co.uk\">www.victoriansociety.co.uk</a>) with advice on Victorian design values. It publishes a series of A4 booklets, costing \u00a33, on topics such as interior mouldings and fire places. It will also field calls on all aspects of restoration. The site itself gives answers to frequent queries, such as how to restore sash windows and whether to double glaze or not. </p> <p>The Victorians were a moralising lot, and the Victoria and Albert Museum teaches good design by negative and positive example. So, on show at the V&amp;A are examples of the 'false principles' which included kitsch delights such as ballet dancers on shirt material. </p> <p>John Ruskin had an interesting take on this. In his essay The Two Paths, he noted that the lowlier the object, the more unnatural and zany its decoration was allowed to be. The higher its purpose, the more restrained and 'natural' the ornament: 'The general law is, that the lower the place and office of the thing, the less of natural or perfect form you should have in it; a zigzag or a chequer is thus a better, because a more consistent, ornament for a cup or platter than a landscape or portrait.' </p> <p>If you begin to think all this authenticity's a bit proscriptive, don't worry. Richard Holder, the Victorian Society's senior architectural adviser, recommends a relaxed approach. 'A modern interior can work in a Victorian house very well. The high ceilings and proportions can look very good done plainly.'</p> <p>It is best, he says to aim for off-white, since the brilliant white we favour today came in after the Victorian era. But he adds, if you have original features aplenty, it makes sense to bow to the period. This needn't mean slavish copying of correct interiors down to the last copy of Mrs Beeton. You can select one aspect of Victorian style - the exuberant colours, say - and major on that. </p> <p>'Remember the Victorian interior decor wasn't quiet. They liked bold, even clashing colours such as deep reds with greens and blues - Laurence Llewellyn Bowen, eat your heart out.'</p> <p>A good place to get advice on the right bold colours is Crown Paints. Its website, <a href=\"http://www.crownpaint.co.uk\">www.crownpaint.co.uk</a>, offers handy hints and a feature that lets you download a picture of your room and try out different colours on it. Or you can phone its advisory service on 0870 240 1127. Crown's period range has colour names that reek of Victorian confidence, from Old English White to Velvet Plum and a glorious Empire Blue. </p> <p>From 9 September to 5 December, the V&amp;A is running an exhibition on a Victorian designer Christopher Dresser, who epitomises much of the period's style. He was one of the first true industrial designers, creating objects of taste for the emerging consumer class. His work for manufacturers such as Wedgwood shows varied influences from botanical forms (he was also a scientist) to Far Eastern art. </p> <p>Then in 1876, he visited Japan and was converted to a form of minimalism. Producing refined metalwork and enthusing over the Japanese worker-oriented ethic, he turned to that second Victorian theme - reaction against the machine age. </p> <p>This autumn, the BBC's big serial is Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South. Prepare for Victorian style and the cult of the mob cap.</p> <p><strong>How to go Victorian</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Think fabric. Suzanne Fegace Cooper says: 'The Victorians draped everything.'This was practical and decorative - she demolishes the covered piano leg myth as being nothing to do with modesty, everything to do with dust. Consult fabric departments in stores such as Liberty in London for expert advice. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't forget Victorian style is usually exuberant and in your face. It isn't quiet, so be bold with colour and design.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cultivate the hoarding instinct and display groups of objects - this was the great age of travel and collecting. When Cooper lived in a Victorian house, she replicated period clutter in modern collections of things from her travels.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Display paintings in groups and bunched together. If you look at pictures of the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition in the Victorian era, every wall was chock-a-block with canvasses. Peter Blake more recently reinvented this big mosaic effect when he curated a couple of rooms during the summer show.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Buy or create a garden in a bottle - instant Victoriana - and don't forget the ferns, the quintessential plant of the period.</p>",
  "<p>Running out of money is a scenario we all dread - and one that can come unexpectedly if redundancy or illness strike. However, there are plenty of steps you can take to ensure that, whatever your circumstances, you can cope with a reduced income over the short or medium term. </p> <p>To improve your financial position quickly you may be able to find a better deal on your car insurance, buildings and contents insurances, and utility bills. Facing a drop in income means it's a good time to sort out your finances. </p> <p>There are two ways to prepare yourself: saving in case you have to face a reduced income, or taking out insurance for protection. Below are scenarios where saving and planning are very important. </p> <p><strong> Retirement </strong></p> <p> Paul Banfield, partner with the independent adviser Best Advice, based in Surrey, advises: 'You need to organise your affairs well in advance rather than wait until you are almost leaving work before inquiring about your pension arrangements. </p> <p>'It is very important that people shop around for their annuity. Many simply take the first quote they receive from their pension provider, but that may not be the best you can get in the open market. For example, you may get enhanced terms if you are a smoker or are in poor health.' </p> <p>He also recommends that you review your car and home insurance policies, as you will probably be able to negotiate a more competitive deal once you are retired. </p> <p>Even if you are nowhere near retirement, it pays to think about it seriously. Nigel Speirs, chief executive of Buckles Investment Services in Rhyl, says starting to save early means your contributions have longer to grow. </p> <p>'If starting a private pension today, a 31-year-old male wanting to retire on an annual pension of around \u00a315,000 at age 65 would need to be making monthly contributions of at least \u00a3148,' he says. 'However, if he wished to retire on an equivalent pension at age 55, this monthly contribution would increase to at least \u00a3363.' </p> <p>At present there are maximum levels of contribution relative to earnings but after April 2006 these are lifted for all but the wealthy (ie, an overall cap of \u00a31.5 million). </p> <p><strong> Setting up a new business </strong></p> <p> 'Embarking upon a new business venture is a major financial commitment which must be planned in advance,' says Speirs. Yet a great number of small businessmen and women don't always take into account the impact this will have on their household finances. </p> <p>Banfield says: 'A lot of people think they can get a loan from the bank but banks often won't lend for new businesses or will only provide a small percentage. You need to plan for at least a year without any income.' </p> <p>He also recommends trying to imagine how you would cope if you had to pay a large invoice at the same time as the bank decided to recall your loan. </p> <p>One option is to check whether your mortgage provider will give you six-month payment holiday. </p> <p><strong> New baby or taking time off work </strong></p> <p> Starting a family or taking a career break are both more manageable if you plan ahead. </p> <p>Nigel Speirs says you should think about how much you will need to live on and to pay your usual costs - insurance policies, mortgage payments and loan repayments. </p> <p>Although maternity benefits could be taken into account, they are no replacement for a salary. </p> <p>Banfield often sees clients where the mum-to-be has intended to return to work, but decides after the child is born to stay at home instead. </p> <p>'All couples should plan the worst-case scenario: if the mother is thinking of returning full-time, they should budget for her working only part-time. Also it is important for her to find out how much she will receive in statutory maternity pay. It could also be worth thinking about overpaying into the mortgage in advance so that you can take a payment holiday if necessary.' </p> <p>He says that money problems frequently crop up not when the baby is born, but when the child turns two or three and 'the financial pain really starts to kick in' - which is why forward planning can really help. </p> <p><strong> Travelling abroad </strong></p> <p> Since people who take time off to go travelling usually end up spending much more than they budgeted for, Banfield suggests borrowing a bit extra on your mortgage before you leave, rather than trying to sort it out in a hurry when you return and have debts to face. </p> <p><strong> Redundancy </strong></p> <p> Speirs says that relying on your savings in the event of being made redundant can only be a short-term solution for most people. State benefits are limited, and will not cover most mortgage payments - if you took out your mortgage after October 1995 no benefits will be available for the first 39 weeks. </p> <p>It is possible to organise accident, sickness and unemployment insurance, although there are limits - for example, there is usually a waiting period between the date of redundancy and the receipt of any benefit. </p> <p>'There will normally be a limit set by the provider as to the amount of benefit available, which may be up to 50 per cent of earnings, or around \u00a31,000 per month, and any benefit will usually be for a limited period of one or two years,' he says. </p> <p>Policies tend to be available for self-employed people, and the options are not cheap - a 30-year-old non-smoking male (with a salary of \u00a320,000) may need to pay about \u00a322 a month to provide cover for the term of his mortgage. </p> <p>Banfield says that people often underestimate how much of their redundancy package they will spend. 'As soon as you receive the lump sum you should put it in the best instant access account you can find, as you don't know what the future will hold,' he says. </p> <p>'I have seen lots of cases where clients have been confident that they will find a new job straight away and have tied their money up and have had to pay penalties to access it when their finances became tight. </p> <p>'You may be job-hunting for longer than you think, even in an industry where there are lots of opportunities, and you may not find your ideal job straight away.' </p> <p><strong> Accident or illness </strong></p> <p> Since both accident and illness may strike unexpectedly, it pays to have your finances in consistently good order. </p> <p>For example, paying off debts with spare money before you invest it, and finding the best mortgage rate will help. There are also a number of policies designed to provide financial support if a person is unable to work due to illness, but they are expensive. </p> <p>A critical illness policy will pay out a lump sum in the event of you being diagnosed with a specific illness. </p> <p>'Most companies will insure against conditions such as cancer, heart attack or kidney failure, for example,' says Speirs. 'Such policies will pay out regardless of whether the patient recovers or is able to return to work. </p> <p>'The cost of such a policy will depend upon the amount of payment required, among other things. For example, our 30-year-old male would need to pay around \u00a320-\u00a330 a month to insure for \u00a330,000 against contracting one of the specified illnesses, or up to \u00a370-\u00a390 a month for cover up to \u00a3100,000.' </p> <p>A personal accident and sickness plan will pay out if the person insured has an accident or is unable to work owing to illness. Permanent health insurance (or income protection insurance) will provide an income to replace the one which is lost when the insured person is unable to work because of accident or illness.</p> <p>'The cost of the plan [the monthly premium] will depend upon a number of factors, including the deferral period,' says Speirs. 'For example, most people would take into account any benefits that they would receive from their employers. If they were entitled to, for example, six months' full pay, then the deferral period for the benefit would normally be six months, and coincide with the time when no alternative income was available.'</p>",
  "<p>Sexually transmitted debt is becoming the scourge of the 21st century. And if you are not a victim, you almost certainly know someone who is. </p> <p>This type of STD - borrowing run up by a partner or ex, but left for you to pay - was identified by Anne, a counsellor for the Consumer Credit Counselling Service (CCCS). </p> <p>Anne's experiences, and those of her clients, form the basis of playwright Gregory Burke's monologue on debt Unsecured, part of the National Theatre's National Headlines season opening this week.</p> <p>Anne (not her real name), who is still suffering from a \u00a314,000 STD contracted nine years ago from her former husband, says: 'I was earning \u00a36,000 a year at the time as a receptionist. My ex wasn't working and forged my signature on credit card applications.' </p> <p>Geeta Varma, senior counsellor at the CCCS, estimates that 20 to 30 per cent of cases dealt with by her organisation include a relationship breakdown. All of these involve an STD. While those seeking help with STDs are equally split between the sexes, it is often the lower paid member of the couple who's left holding the bills. </p> <p>'Retailers often aren't bothered about getting two names on the application for finance. We've seen cases where someone has clearly understood exactly what they were doing by getting all the credit agreements set up in their partner's names,' she says. </p> <p>Anne didn't realise what was happening until her husband left. But in some cases a spouse will willingly take over a debt from a partner, only to have the gesture backfire. Tony, a thirtysomething from Norwich, has bailed out two different girlfriends, never to see the money again. </p> <p>'The first time, I had been living with my girlfriend for about three years and she had built up a \u00a31,800 debt on her credit card. </p> <p>'I thought she was worried about being in debt, rather than concerned about not being able to up her credit limits and continue shopping, so I paid it off for her. </p> <p>'When our relationship ended six months later, it got forgotten in all the rows about the house. </p> <p>'She is keen on us getting back together but I have discovered that she has since built up a \u00a311,000 credit card debt and that has rather put me off the idea.' </p> <p>More often, STDs are the result of a joint purchase which is left to one partner to deal with when the relationship fails. </p> <p>The CCCS has even dealt with one man who was left to handle a \u00a310,000 loan taken out to pay for his wedding six years before. </p> <p>Varma says that although lenders are legally entitled to pursue their money, they will sometimes take circumstances into account and temper their action accordingly. </p> <p>She cites the case of one woman, who had bought a car on hire purchase for her partner. On leaving her, he took the car and said he would keep up the payments, but when a new job provided him with a company car, he dumped the old one on her drive and left her to deal with it. </p> <p>'She couldn't even drive,' says Varma. 'We advised her to talk to the finance company and ask the car dealer to sell it from his forecourt, rather than putting it into auction, so it fetched a better price. That meant she had less money to repay to the HP company.' </p> <p>Varma says dealing with numerous cases of financial infidelity has made her realise the value of pre-nuptial agreements, however unromantic they might seem. 'Just be fully aware of what you are getting into. Don't go into a relationship with rose-tinted specs on.' </p> <p>Varma suggests the following steps to avoid STDs and to deal with those already passed on: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Do not ask for a second credit card to be issued for your partner. Any debt he or she racks up is legally your responsibility and will not be taken into consideration in a divorce settlement. The credit card company is entitled to pursue you alone for full payment. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you already share a credit card account, ask the issuer to close the account and cancel the cards. It's not the first thing you think of while going through a break-up, but your ex can do a lot of spending in the time it takes for your next statement to come through. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't be persuaded into taking on more instalment credit (loans to buy goods from shops) than you can afford to repay from your income alone. </p> <p>Any borrowing done in your name is your responsibility, even if you don't actually end up with the goods. </p> <p>If unpaid, these loans usually end up in the hands of debt collectors, because the goods have no resale value and the original lender will not be interested in pursuing you for small repayments. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Shut joint bank accounts, even if they are in credit. The bank will require both of you to give permission for the closure. </p> <p>If the account is in overdraft, you will be held 'jointly and severally' responsible for repaying the debt - and if your partner refuses to pay his or her share, the bank is legally entitled to come after you for the remainder. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you have bought a car through hire purchase for your partner, make sure your partner is registered as the car's keeper, so you don't get lumbered with their parking fines and speeding tickets. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If that partner becomes an ex, be very careful about stopping payments. The car belongs to the HP company you have borrowed from until you make the last payment and it can repossess if you miss a payment. </p> <p>The car would then be sold at auction, usually fetching less than the amount you owe the HP company, which will then pursue you for the shortfall. </p> <p>If your ex refuses to take over the HP payments or return the car, you should report it as missing to the police. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Taking over property-related debt is much more complicated. Even if you think you can manage to continue with the mortgage payments on your home, your lender will baulk at switching a loan in joint names to one borrower, unless it thinks that person will be able to pay the mortgage for the next 20 years or so. </p> <p>You could reduce the size of your monthly outgoings by switching to an interest-only mortgage, but you will have to repay the loan somehow at the end of the term, even if it means selling up. </p> <p>If you are unemployed or on a low income, the Benefits Agency may decide you qualify for help with the mortgage interest, but this is likely to take several months to come through, by which time you will owe hefty arrears. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Keep the lender informed of your situation. </p> <p>There is nothing they like less than being kept in the dark and most companies would much prefer you to arrange to repay a bit, however little, than have you stop paying altogether. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you are still on good terms, try to get your ex to contribute to debts that you ran up together. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't try to deal with your debts alone. Talk to someone professional about your situation. </p> <p>The CCCS provides free advice - call 0800 138 1111 for further information, or try the National Debtline on 0808 8084000, or your local Citizens' Advice Bureau. </p> <p>Avoid debt management companies - they charge fees, which is the last thing you need when you are weighed down with debt.</p> <p><strong>'Supporting my ex left me \u00a3200,000 in the red'</strong></p> <p>Sexually transmitted debt is not always a guilty secret left by a departing spouse for the ex. It can occur with the knowledge of both partners. </p> <p>Len (not his real name), a social worker in his late 50s, ran up unsecured debts of \u00a3200,000 supporting his ex-wife and stepson. He also has two children of his own, both of whom live at home.</p> <p>Len started to use credit to meet everyday expenses. Although he earns less than \u00a32,000 a month net, he was able to take out 12 credit cards - including one with a credit balance of \u00a374,000 - and personal loans. Len has a deficit of \u00a3300 a month after taking account of living expenses. When his debt reached \u00a320,000, he took out further loans to pay it off and the interest started piling up.</p> <p>Given the few years that remain until he retires, Len is highly unlikely to pay off his debts out of income. His house is worth \u00a3250,000 but he still has \u00a3125,000 to pay off on his mortgage. The CCCS has arranged for him to go on a repayment plan and to send his creditors \u00a35 a month. This will give him time to sell his house and give his wife her share of the proceeds. Once the house has been sold, the counsellor thinks Len's best course of action is personal bankruptcy, or, possibly, to try to negotiate full and final settlement figures with the equity released from his property.</p> <p><strong>'I could have ruined our family'</strong></p> <p>'Alex has paid off my debts twice. The first time it was for \u00a315,000. We were having some work done on the kitchen and he was remortgaging the house. He knew I had a loan for my car and a small credit card debt and thought we might as well roll the whole lot into the mortgage, so asked me how much I owed. </p> <p>He was shocked at the amount, but said it was silly to pay high rates of interest when it could be added to the mortgage, which he pays. His one condition was that I shouldn't run up any more debt. From time to time since, he's asked me if I'm managing and I've said yes. But I was struggling.</p> <p>It came to a head a few months ago, when he discovered I had run up a \u00a32,000 overdraft and about the same amount on credit cards. He was furious. He decided then that if he didn't take control I would ruin the family.</p> <p>Now I have \u00a3500 a month for clothes, travel, going out, hairdresser and presents, a lot more than I used to spend on myself. The rest goes into a joint account for the household, which Alex controls. I still do the grocery shopping, but using a credit card that Alex pays.</p> <p>I will never take out a credit card in my own name again. Initially it seemed very strange to lose my independence like that, but now it is a total relief.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Gregory Burke's monologue 'Unsecured' will premier at the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/headlines\">National Theatre</a> on 19 October, as part of the National Headlines series.

  "<p>On 27 October the people of Turkmenistan - a gas-rich, desert-dominated central Asian country - will be celebrating 13 years of independence from the former Soviet Union. There will be feasts and military parades in the gleaming capital, Ashgabat. But, like the Soviet-era buildings behind the marble facades, the fabric of society is crumbling under the rule of the man they will be praising: Saparmurat Niyazov, Turkmenbashi the Great, Turkmenistan's 'President for Life'.</p> <p>Turkmenistan, which is twice the size of the UK yet has a population of just 5m, has since seceding from the Soviet Union in 1991, 'acquired one of the worst totalitarian systems in the world', according to the European parliament. And central to this system is a cult of personality to match Mao Tse-Tung, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong Il. Turkmenistan's President Niyazov is a man, after all, who has renamed the month of January - after himself.</p> <p>In the last decade, thousands of statues of Niyazov have been erected across the country. The grandest is 12 metres high and coated in gold leaf; it stands on top of a 75-metre tall monument in the centre of Ashgabat and rotates to face the sun. Airports, regions, meteorites, cities and schools have been renamed after the president and his parents. Meetings in his office are televised and broadcast weekly on the three state TV channels.</p> <p>As well as renaming January, Niyazov has renamed April after his mother, May after his father and September after his 'divinely inspired' masterwork, the Rukhnama. This 'book of the soul' dominates the life of his subjects. Written between 1997 and 2001, it fills bookstores across the country and has been made the cornerstone of an otherwise ravaged educational establishment. 'On a par with the Bible and the Koran, it is to be used as a Spiritual Guide,' writes Niyazov in the introduction, 'to remove the complexities and anguishes from day to day living.' There are regular pageants staged in sports stadiums depicting scenes from this opus, centring on the moral purity of his mother and father. And every morning at factories and schools the citizens sing the national anthem, which refers to Turkmenistan as 'The great creation of Turkmenbashi'. </p> <p>'If I was a worker and my president gave me all the things they have here in Turkmenistan, I would not only paint his picture, I would have his picture on my shoulder, or on my clothing,' Niyazov said earlier this year. 'I'm personally against seeing my pictures and statues in the street - but it's what people want.'</p> <p>Saparmurat Atajevich Niyazov was born in the small village of Kipcak on the outskirts of Ashgabat in 1940. His father died in the Second World War, while his mother and brother were among the 100,000 killed in an earthquake that destroyed the capital in 1948. Niyazov grew up in an orphanage and went to study in St Petersburg, before returning to Ashgabat to work as an engineer. He joined the Communist Party in 1962 and rose through the ranks before being chosen by the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to be General Secretary of the Communist Party of Turkmenistan in 1985. It was perceived that his marriage to a Russian wife and his upbringing in an orphanage made him free of any clan-allegiance - an important factor for a clan-based society like Turkmenistan's - and therefore perfect for the job. He was chosen to carry out Moscow's will because of his deference and obedience, and he proceeded to do so without dissent. </p> <p>Perhaps understandably, given his party background, Niyazov was not in favour of Turkmenistan's independence when the Soviet Union began to disintegrate. When it became inevitable, however, he embraced the new ideology as enthusiastically as he had the old, assuming power as president, prime minister and the chairman of the council of ministers, and promoting Turkmen nationalism as his central aim - always with himself at the centre. As the Soviet yoke fell away he assumed the name 'Turkmenbashi' ('father of the Turkmen'). He then set about forging the nation's new identity in his own image. Turkmen opposition figures were either driven into exile or imprisoned. (Most have since been released, but after their experiences in prison, and under constant surveillance since, those still in the country have never dared to speak out.)</p> <p>In 1992, Niyazov 'won' the first presidential elections unopposed, and settled into a Soviet-style dictatorship. His handpicked council of ministers voted him president for life in 1999. In 2001 the Humanitarian Association of the World's Ethnic Turkmens voted to suffix Niyazov's name with Beyt ('great'), much to the president's dismay. 'I am afraid of ever more titles - some even say I am a prophet,' he complained. </p> <p>State-owned newspapers are full of letters from citizens proclaiming their love for Niyazov. But loyalty to the president is not optional. Foreign newspapers are banned, and satellite TV is restricted and censored. The radio station Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty is jammed in most towns. For obvious reasons, news of nearby Georgia's 'Rose Revolution' - the American-engineered overthrow of Eduard Shevardnadze, last November - was not reported at all. </p> <p>Meanwhile, bugging of telephones is assumed to be rife. Members of the intelligence services, police and military are visible on the streets of Ashgabat and other towns. Access to the internet is limited and monitored. Public demonstrations have been suppressed ruthlessly and no longer take place at all. Only two religions are freely practised: Islam and orthodox Christianity. And freedom of movement is nonexistent: Turkmen citizens need permits to enter 'special closed zones' which cover 40 per cent of the country, and travel is restricted between rural areas and the cities. According to the former US Ambassador to Turkmenistan, Laura Kennedy: 'Turkmenbashi controls everything in this country. He personally decides who comes in, who goes out.' Announcing in March that government agencies would intensify their video surveillance of Turkmen citizens - installing cameras on every major street and site in the country - Niyazov said, 'We should know if a fly quietly buzzes past.'</p> <p>The cameras, he claims, are there 'not due to a lack of trust, but to avoid disorder'. And the consequences of 'disorder' are grave. Insulting Niyazov carries a minimum five-year prison sentence. Last year, terrifyingly vague treason laws were passed, carrying life imprisonment for anyone 'attempting to sow doubt among people about the internal and foreign policies conducted by the first and permanent president of Turkmenistan, the Great Saparmurat', or even 'encouraging opposition to the state'. Professor Jerrold Post - who founded the CIA's Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior, and is director of the Political Psychology Program at George Washington University - is building a psychological profile of Niyazov. 'There have only been a few cults of personality to match this; Kim Jong Il and Kim Il-sung in North Korea, and Mao Tse-Tung. The narcissism of the man is really beyond description - he has essentially turned himself into a living god.'</p> <p>Niyazov's grip on Turkmenistan tightened dramatically following the events of 25 November 2002, when shots were fired at the presidential motorcade. Deemed a set-up by some observers, it led to the arrests of hundreds of political opponents, journalists, intellectuals and their family members. A month later at least 59 suspects were jailed after televised show trials reminiscent of the Stalin era, during which defence lawyers actually apologised for representing their clients. These included a drugged and bruised Boris Shikhmuradov, formerly foreign minister, whose confession to masterminding the assassination attempt was clearly read from a script. 'I and my allies... are not opposition members but ordinary criminals and drug addicts... we are all worms... I am a criminal able only to destroy the state.' </p> <p>According to Amnesty International: 'The relatives of those imprisoned after the November 2002 events have still not been allowed to visit the prisoners. Many were tortured and there are indications that some died in prison, but there is no way of finding out the truth.' </p> <p>A ratcheting up of state repression followed across the board, including the sacking, in January 2003, of the chief mufti, Nasrullah ibn Ibadullah, who had led Turkmenistan's Muslims (the country's official religion) for the previous 10 years. Reports variously suggest he was suspected of involvement in the 'assassination' attempt, objected to having phrases from the Rukhnama written on the walls of mosques, or refused to declare publicly that Niyazov is 'God's prophet'. In March, Ibadullah was sentenced to 22 years in prison for reasons that remain unclear. In the same month two of the few independent journalists left in the country, from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, were arrested, beaten, drugged and threatened against broadcasting within the country. An estimated 20,000 dissidents are now in prison. </p> <p>Niyazov writes in the Rukhnama: 'I am attempting to have a logical kind of freedom accepted and approved by this nation. Otherwise freedom will turn into irregularity and destroy the essentials of the state and harm the society.'</p> <p>Murad Turayev and Bayram Medrov (not their real names) are civil activists from the west and east of the country and have gathered and passed on information about the human rights situation in Turkmenistan at great personal risk. Turayev says the alienation felt by the majority of Turkmens is almost total: 'The country has been converted into a hopeless and sinister reservation closed from the outside world. The main part of the population simply doesn't have any interest in what happens. Extreme poverty, unemployment and drug-taking have produced fear and hopelessness.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, Niyazov continues unchecked. Ever more eccentric edicts are carried out by increasingly sycophantic flunkeys and Western companies who are happy to land vast construction contracts. In August, Niyazov broadcast on state TV perhaps his oddest plan yet. 'Let us build a palace of ice so our children can learn to ice skate,' he said, 'big and grand enough for 1,000 people.' With temperatures reaching 50C across much of the nation in summer, many people expected nothing to come of the idea, but Niyazov's favourite construction company, the French firm Bouygues, is scheduled to start on the \u00a313m project next month.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest threat posed by Niyazov's regime is an artificial lake under construction in the Karakum desert, to be known as the Golden Age Lake. At an estimated cost of $6.5bn, it is expected by many scientists to reduce the scarce and vital water supplies of the desert nation through drainage and evaporation. Experts say the best expenditure of funds would be to dredge and re-line the Karakum canal which makes life possible for a large proportion of the Turkmen population. A senior Western official in Ashgabat, who refused to be named, believes Turkmenistan is at a crossroads. 'What it does in the next 50 years will determine what it will be like in the next 10,000 years. It will either be a country that can sustain a population of up to 8or 10 million forever, or it will go back to being a desert with a few watering holes. If it doesn't invest its hydrocarbon profits in the water infrastructure we will be bringing food aid in 50 years' time.</p> <p>'With the right leader,' says the official, 'it has a chance, but Niyazov's only looking at the next 25 years - he just wants people to be quiet while he fulfils his dreams of grandeur.'</p> <p>If one section of the population is the most sympathetic to its president it is the youth of Turkmenistan. According to Medrov: 'A new generation is emerging that knows nothing apart from official propaganda. Before, everyone spoke Russian, could watch TV and know something about what happens in the world, but this new generation only speaks Turkmen, so they are absolutely cut off from all this. Today's state rule is becoming popular among them and this is a new danger.'</p> <p>The brainwashing is intense. Children at nursery learn phrases from the Rukhnama in praise of the great Turkmenbashi before they can read; schoolchildren have to spend two hours a day reading and pondering the lessons it contains. Entrance to university, interviews for jobs in the administration, even driving tests, depend on knowledge of the text. Earlier this year four Russian-speaking officials in the city of Turkmenbashi (formerly Krasnovodsk) were sacked after failing the Rukhnama exam. One high-school maths teacher in Ashgabat misread the question 'What are the names of the mother and father of the president's horse?' and instead named the president's mother and father. As a result, she was denied accreditation. </p> <p>Erika Dailey, director of the Open Society Institute's Turkmenistan Project, says: 'The government encourages children to go home and quiz their parents on the Rukhnama - and to tell their teacher if they are lacking in knowledge.' Meanwhile, parents know their children have no alternative route to success other than winning cash prizes and appearances on TV by singing songs and reciting poems in praise of Niyazov. The education system is already hamstrung by the removal of children aged 10 and over to harvest cotton from September to November, and the shortening of the state education period from 11 to 9 years. Ballet, opera, the circus and the cinema are banned in Turkmenistan - condemned by Niyazov as contrary to national traditions. And a law passed last November required non-governmental organisations to re-register, heralding the closure of groups from ecology clubs to a sports club for disabled teenagers. The scope for development is shrinking all the time.</p> <p>The only head of state the 40 per cent of the population under the age of 14 have ever known is President Niyazov. According to Murad Turayev: 'The new generation of young boys and girls... consider it absolutely normal to read the Rukhnama and give all these oaths to the president. For a quarter of the country's population, the Rukhnama is virtually the only book they will have read.'</p> <p>The anonymous Western official adds: 'Within one or two generations you will find a population of younger people who are totally useless, incapable of living in modern society.'</p> <p>Yet this generation plays an increasingly important role in Niyazov's heavily policed state. Military service is two years and usually starts at 17 years old. Groups of teenagers with Kalashnikovs check the documents of people driving across the country. In order to bolster the failing economy conscripts work as lorry drivers, bakers, train attendants, traffic police and factory workers. On 11 February Niyazov sacked a third of the medical workforce - around 15,000 nurses and healthcare workers - by presidential decree, replacing them with conscripts to save the state money. The Western official says that a priority for the country is 'trained people to run its services and its oil and gas industry. At the moment they have to buy in all their technicians from all over the world. If they don't keep pumping, which pays for the massive subsidy system to the nation, this country will slip into chaos.' </p> <p>Niyazov claimed on independence that Turkmenistan would be the new Kuwait. Bordering the Caspian Sea, the country has vast proven gas reserves - the fifth largest in the world - and plenty of oil. By 2001 this was modified to a promise that within a year every family would have 'a house, a car, and a cow with calf'. This promise was then dropped for the more ambiguous propaganda slogan that 'the 21st century is the golden age of the Turkmens'. </p> <p>Yet gas production is still not back up to the levels of the early Nineties. Plans to build pipelines to Western markets in the Arabian gulf or Mediterranean have foundered, due to regional instability and Niyazov's unpredictability. The state provides free gas and water, cheap housing and bread, and for the men in Ashgabat at least, horse races. But anecdotally - for there are no hard statistics on Turkmenistan - unemployment, underemployment and non-payment of salaries are rife and worsening; state services are disintegrating; life expectancy falling. The free supply of gas and water is at the heart of all of Niyazov's claims to be a generous, successful leader. When he introduced the system 12 years ago it was supposed to remain in place for a decade before people began to pay. The anonymous Western official says, 'If these services were withdrawn there would be chaos, you'd be looking at a revolution.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, despite EU and UN resolutions requesting that the Turkmen authorities co-operate with international human rights organisations, no such co-operation has ensued. Certain laws - the introduction of exit visas, the restriction of religious practice - have been amended, but in practice little has changed; people cannot leave the country freely and they are free only to practise the central religions. </p> <p>Human Rights Watch believes international organisations have some leverage: 'The Turkmen government takes great pride in its UN membership. The UN must make clear that [Turkmenistan's] failure to co-operate is unacceptable.'</p> <p>Aaron Rhodes, executive director of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, says that support from major foreign governments is needed: 'Much more could be done to force peaceful change; if major world leaders with authority would acknowledge that this is a dictatorship, depriving people of rights, this would really have an effect.' </p> <p>But there are other factors to consider. The US Airforce benefits from being able to fly its jets through Turkmen airspace. The vast reserves of gas and oil in Turkmenistan have been the subject of frantic lobbying by Western governments in the past, and the possibility of securing access in the future must act as a brake to any criticisms of Niyazov. In fact, a high-level Russian delegation visiting Niyazov earlier in the year praised his achievements as 'fantastic' and the Rukhnama as 'a serious philosophical work'. They also signed a co-operation agreement designed to encourage joint investment in the fishing industry, mining and, most importantly, gas production. </p> <p>According to Rhodes, 'There's a tremendous tendency to support the status quo. People don't want to rock the boat, they don't need another failed state on their hands. They probably would like to see Turkmenbashi keep power.' </p> <p>Erika Dailey believes the status quo will lead to disaster. 'If the trend continues, and neither economic nor political reform is introduced soon, Turkmenistan will become non-functional, a failed state.'</p> <p>Robert Corzine is one of the few Western journalists to have met Niyazov. In his experience, the president is unlikely to be unduly swayed by outside influence. He recalls an interview in 1999 in which the subject of the oil- and gas-rich Caspian Sea arose: 'Niyazov got a map and said, \"I'll tell you who owns the Caspian,\" and he took out his $1,000 pen, crossed out the word Azeri Oilfield [property of Azerbaijan] and wrote Serdar ['leader' - his name] Oilfield in its place. Stabbing the map he said, \"That's mine, that's mine.\" When I left the meeting, his then foreign minister Boris Shikhmuradov, who was more of a suave character, said, \"You can tone down some of the things the president said.\" But Niyazov, who had overheard, said: \"No, he can write whatever he wants.\" The next day when the story appeared the Azerbaijanis sent gunboats out.'</p> <p>Despite a recent heart bypass operation there are no serious indications that Niyazov has a succession plan: an election mooted for 2008 is expected to disappear like previous dates, and he will almost certainly rule until he dies. According to one Western observer Niyazov won't be worried about succession, either: 'He wants to leave the greatest mosque and all his buildings and monuments, and go down in history as the great salvation of Turkmenistan and the greatest Khan - greater even than Tamburlaine or Ghengis Khan.'</p>",
  "<p>When a band breaks up, says Shaznay Lewis, survivor of one of the most acrimonious pop splits ever, it's like a four-way divorce. 'It is, it really is! We had had quite a few \"It's Overs\". But then the next day (she cradles an imaginary Nokia against the side of her face) it's all ...\"I'm sorry, I love you ... Oh, I love you too ...\" The tears, the hugging, the fighting, the making up ... but you do love them. They were like sisters to me.' </p> <p>She sits on the bed in a fashionable south-west London hotel and makes insistent gestures with her hands. She's talking intensely, tripping over words, and her Bambi eyes grow bigger and rounder yet with her desire to be understood and believed. Then she slows down, quietens, deflates into the stylish satin bedspread a little. 'And then it was over. And I knew it.' </p> <p>It's been four years since All Saints imploded over disputed ownership of a combat jacket. Lewis had been allotted it for a photo shoot, one of the others wanted it, and: 'I would never in a million years have put money on the group ending over a jacket incident. But when that incident happened, it fired up so strong, it had to be over.' She smiles ruefully. 'And the way I was then, the state we'd got into then, there was no way she was getting that stupid jacket.' </p> <p>So the band that for several years had churned out consistently deft, surprising, hip and credible R 'n' B edged pop went into meltdown. It was an appropriate end. All Saints were the hard-edged, unsmiling, mean girls alternative to the Spice Girls; a four-piece, combat-pant-clad, midriff-exposing, slutty Rolling Stones to the Spices's Beatles. Bitchiness, competitiveness, volatility and cat fighting were all part of their brand - of course they'd go down in a searing flame of pettiness, melodrama, and fashion-related over-reaction. </p> <p>It was equally, delightfully fitting when, a year-and-a-half later, Nicole and Natalie Appleton, the blond, pap-and-publicity-addled sisters who dominated the group (despite having the weakest voices of the four and being described more than once by the music press as 'superannuated back-up singers'), published Together . This memoir of their time in All Saints claimed, among other things, that Lewis reacted with fury on discovering that Nicole was pregnant by then-boyfriend Robbie Williams. </p> <p>For most of her twenties Lewis was one quarter of this band of hard-living hellcats. Subsequently she's been living through the gruesome and public aftermath. Accordingly, I expect certain things from Shaznay Lewis. We meet because she is in the throes of launching her solo career. 'You', the second single from debut album, Open, is out this month. She would like to talk about it. So I prepare myself for Trial By Ex-All Saint. I anticipate 45 minutes in the presence of a hardbitten, jaded, old-beyond-her 28-years kind of glamour. An enduring bitterness. An arrogance - it was Lewis, after all, who wrote the vast majority of All Saint's hits; Lewis who won an Ivor Novello for 'Pure Shores', who was responsible for the exquisite 'Never Ever'. </p> <p>I expect a sullen reluctance to rehash the finer details of the All Saints break-up and a kind of residual, background hum of sneering and stroppiness, characteristics I'd always associated with Lewis's pouting public face. On meeting her I instantly discover I'm mistaken on every count. She is, above and beyond everything else, quite ordinary. Pretty, but averagely so. Shy. Sweet. Fantastically eager to please - she thinks very hard about questions before she answers - she's desperate to get it all absolutely right and clear. She's inclined to rephrase responses so that she can use my words. She's full of mild-mannered Oprah book club type psychology: 'I couldn't get my shit together for ages [after the group ended]. I hadn't closed one book before I'd opened another. It wasn't until I confronted how hurt I was and dealt with that, that I was able to ... exhale.' </p> <p>She's giggly, she seems younger than she actually is. And she's gratifyingly happy to discuss the old days. </p> <p>Unlike pretty much every other group of its type, All Saints was a truly organic proposition, rather than being masterminded by a shadowy, unscrupulous Svengali figure with a marketing vision. Shaznay Lewis grew up on a council estate off London's Caledonian Road, tap-dancing, loving music, and writing angst-ridden ballads. 'I was very much into things that rhymed.' </p> <p>She didn't go to stage school because she 'didn't know they existed' but by the time she left school at 18 she knew she wanted to write and sing, so signed on and began working at it in earnest: hanging out in the right creative circles, spending time in studios, ingratiating herself with the likes of producer and ex-Curiosity Killed the Cat front man Ben Volpierre Pierrot. But she insists: 'I didn't want to be famous. I never even thought about it. When I got famous, that was a bit like... oooh, shit. That was a bit of an Oops.' </p> <p>She met Melanie Blatt in a studio on All Saints Road. 'My first impression of Mel was: she fancies that bloke! There was another artist in the room, and she was sat behind this desk going [Lewis adopts a coquettish voice]: \"I'm thinking of dying my hair. What do you think?\" ' </p> <p>Lewis thought Blatt would be too girly to be a friend, but they became close none the less. 'She started coming out clubbing with me and my friends, which she hadn't done before, and we changed her from tight skirts into baggy trousers and little tops.' </p> <p>You styled her up? </p> <p>'Yeah.' </p> <p>The signature All Saints look - the look which would eventually be recreated by several hundred thousand teenage girls - was born. </p> <p>Blatt and Lewis began singing Lewis's songs together. They made demos and eventually signed with the ZTT label as an early incarnation of All Saints. They played the Smash Hits Poll Winners party. 'And that was like, \"Oh my God! Biggest thing ever\".' </p> <p>ZTT dropped them, but Lewis wasn't devastated. 'We didn't have a lot to lose. There was no money in it. They'd give us 50 quid and send us to Mr Byrite to get clothes for the video. We were like: that doesn't feel like it should be happening like that.' </p> <p>Shortly afterwards Blatt bumped into Natalie and Nicole Appleton, her former best friends from stage school, introduced them to Lewis, and the ultimate All Saint line-up was created. 'We went into the studio together with a producer for four or five months, making demos, building up a showcase. Then we signed to London Records.' But not before Blatt and the Appletons went to a label executive behind Lewis's back with their own demo, which included an early recording of Lewis singing 'Never Ever'. The exec told them to get Lewis back on board. 'I was a bit shocked, to be honest. That was a bit ...' </p> <p>Sneaky? </p> <p>'Yeah, sneaky. But I was like, you know Shaz, it's something you've always wanted. Don't cut your nose off. Look at the bigger picture. So I swallowed my tongue. And then we were all so excited to get the offer, nothing else mattered. The group was the four of us, and we did all want the same thing, didn't we?' </p> <p>Not entirely, it transpired. While Lewis and Blatt were essentially interested in making good records, the Appletons embraced their spiralling celebrity with terrifying dedication. They made the Met Bar (hedonistic cocktail-peddling destination bar of the moment) their second home, worked their way through a succession of high profile boyfriends and became unswervingly reliable tabloid fodder. 'I was blown over by the fact that I had a chance to make a record,' says Lewis. 'The fame side - I found it more uncomfortable. But the girls [she only ever refers to her nemesis in those terms, never by name], they really wanted it. They could handle that side of things, and leave me and Mel to get on with it.' </p> <p>Divisions were established. Blatt's loyalties wavered between the Appletons, her long-standing friends, and Lewis, whose aspirations were closer to her own. Lewis's instinctive ability to knock out a killer pop song or two became a mixed blessing. 'I was writing all of it, which meant I got some power back, but it created ... it was all of them in the same boat, versus me.' Yet there were always, Lewis insists, fantastic moments. 'We were a gang! You'd be on stage, and you'd look over at how your mate was handling the crowd, and you'd be so proud.' </p> <p>Was it ever as bad as it was rumoured to be, I ask. </p> <p>'No. We argued at times and we didn't get on at times, but I'm sure not as much as it was perceived.' </p> <p>The physical punch-ups never happened, for example? 'No! We never had physical fights.' But you heard the rumours? </p> <p>'Yeah yeah yeah. Never hit each other. Probably come close to it. Probably squared off a little bit. But definitely none of us have ever laid a hand on each other. Ever.' </p> <p>If you had, do you think you'd have won? </p> <p>'Yeah, probably. Ha ha! If I'm being honest. Though the sisters are quite feisty, and if you hit one, you'd have to hit the other. That's how it would have gone. There's no way one of them would sit back and let the other one get hit. They would have both tried to jump in. But I never felt the need to go that far.' </p> <p>So how bad did it get? </p> <p>'Just arguing really. Storming out. Which is probably quite common. It's girls! And at that age too, when I look back now, your hormones are all over the place. You're becoming a woman, and with that kind of success you think you're more of a woman than you are. And egos. Oh my God. The egos! Do you know what I mean?' </p> <p>Did you have an ego? </p> <p>'Ummmm, I don't think I did. I was stubborn. That's a regret. I shouldn't have been so stubborn.' </p> <p>So eventually, after two-and-a-half years, five No 1 singles, two albums, two Brit awards and a series of bust-ups and minor betrayals (highlight: when Blatt and the Appletons landed roles in Dave Stewart's ill-judged cockney gangster flick Honest without telling Lewis), All Saints stumbled to a halt. Lewis was left emotionally battered, but in possession of a rumoured \u00a37 million worth of writing credits. \u00a37 million? Really? 'I should hope so! At least! But you still have that worry. You always want to make sure you're all right. Cos at the end of the day, the tax man is always going to come knocking on your door. And that's a pain in the arse. Some days you're like: what's the point? Why do I even bother going to work?' </p> <p>Life after All Saints is a relatively calm affair, Lewis says. Blatt is still a close friend - she was recently a bridesmaid at Lewis's wedding to long-term boyfriend Christian - but she hasn't spoken to either of the Appletons since the publication of Together . She says she has never read the book but comments: 'That was that for me. I know so much shit on them, on everybody, but you would never get me to say. Never. You don't do that.' </p> <p>Lewis has moved out of London into a big house in the Hertfordshire countryside and splits her time between there and her studio in the capital. Apart from a cameo in the 2002 movie Bend It Like Beckham she has largely avoided a public existence, eschewing the red carpets, launches and high profile parties she never particularly enjoyed when she was in All Saints. Unsurprising then that she is hesitant about her solo career, about the attention it will bring. 'I didn't know if I was built for it or not. I loved being in a group, sharing the pressure of promo, all the in-jokes... I miss it.' </p> <p>Yet Open is a convincing starting bid. It took her a lot longer than both she and her public expected. After all, she was the talented one. But it's better for it. Unrushed, considered, accomplished, Lewis insists it's a departure from All Saints material - but, happily, it isn't. Not really. Possibly because it's monopolised by Lewis's glorious, tender, lovelorn vocals. Possibly because her writing was so much of All Saints' identity. It feels like the starting point for an enduring career. </p> <p>It's good, I tell her. Really good. </p> <p>'Yeah?' She laughs. 'Ha ha! You can put that in if you like. Finish it like that. That would be nice.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 'You' is released on 18 October on London Records</p>",
  "<b> The following apology was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday October 24 2004</b> <br> Heavy editing to Gill Lusk's letter, below, removed her central point: that the crisis is too serious to be judged in superficial anti- or pro-American terms. What the US government says on Sudan is not the issue, which remains the killing of tens of thousands of civilians by their own government. <p>Peter Beaumont (News, last week) gives credibility to a scurrilous story. I can confirm that what I saw in Darfur was not some random violence or starvation, but co-ordinated efforts by the Janjaweed, with the assistance and collusion of the government of Sudan, to wipe out the black population. Women with tears streaming down their faces told of unspeakable brutality, and we heard about decades of systematic persecution and discrimination. The legal definitions of genocide included in the UN convention, in my view, are already fulfilled. </p> <p>The death toll continues to rise, and civilians are being attacked and fleeing their villages. This has been confirmed by the UN and other sources. In addition, the ceasefire continues to be violated. Ethnic cleansing combined with a scorched-earth policy has brought terrible misery and suffering. Fifty thousand are dead, and 1.45 million have fled in terror from their villages. </p> <p>To talk of genocide is not just semantics or word play. As a Rwandan soldier, serving in the AU force, who I met in Darfur, claimed: 'It is an opportunity, for once, to recognise this tragedy for what it is.' </p> <p>The government of Sudan and the rebels should now co-operate with the UN's decision to properly investigate the violations of humanitarian and human rights law. Kofi Annan has actually confirmed that there will be a commission to determine whether or not genocide has occurred. For the first time, Article 8 of the Genocide Convention has been used.<br> <b>Glenys Kinnock MEP</b><br> (Labour Wales) <br> European Parliament <br> Brussels </p> <p>We are used to knee-jerk anti-Americanism from The Observer but to indulge such urges at the expense of the people suffering genocide in Darfur is deeply shocking. It may also do incalculable damage to attempts to raise enough funds to reduce the very death tolls which your piece claims are 'hyped'. <br> <b>Gill Lusk</b><br> London EC1 </p> <p>What makes Peter Beaumont so sure the crisis in Sudan is over-played? The regime still refuses to allow civilian protection forces from the AU, and aid agencies complain privately that they cannot speak out about atrocities and obstruction if they want to keep working in Darfur. </p> <p>Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people outside the displaced camps are still unaccounted for or unreachable, and the government raids - helicopter gunships and bombers as well as the militia - continue. If we are serious about minimising the already massive number of avoidable deaths, there are no grounds for complacency.<br> <b>Peter Verney</b><br> Editor, Sudan Update publications<br> Hebden Bridge<br> West Yorkshire </p> <p>I was relieved to read Peter Beaumont's article. Despite the experience we all have of US distorting and hyping accusations for political purposes, credit is still given to such claims until evidence shows them up. </p> <p>The problem seems to be that the world is too polite and frightened of US power to call lies and liars what they are. How can any claim Colin Powell might make about anything be given any credibility after his shameful performance on Iraq with the Security Council? How can any claim George W Bush makes be given any credibility after his repeated lies and distortions on Iraq and Palestine? <br> <b>Christopher Leadbeater</b><br> Ashford, Kent</p>",
  "<p>I recognise there are certain things about myself that only surface at certain times of the year. As September rolls into October, I become obsessed with apples. Now obviously this is provoked by the ripening fruit clustering on the trees in our orchard, but it is as though all things pomological ripen in me, too. I eat apples all day, stewed Reverend Wilkes and Arthur Turner for breakfast, munch Tydeman's Early Worcester, Worcester Pearmain and James Grieve at my desk and as I garden, and make crumble, tarts, pies and bake the cookers, as and when they ripen. </p> <p>I want to devour them in every way and become painfully aware of how little I really know about them. Apples began to appeal to the scholarly mind in the 1790s with Thomas Payne Knight breeding apples just up the road from where I live. By the beginning of the 19th century, the prospect of classifying and collecting hundreds of different varieties became intoxicating and the Victorians took to pomology with zeal. It is all about subtle degrees of order and control and even the physical placing of the different apples in their proper places in the apple store is an important part of that. </p> <p>Apple store? For sure. Sarah is always telling people that we built our apple store, which is in reality little more than a large cupboard with floor-to-ceiling slatted shelves, years before we had shelves to put our linen on. An apple store sounds grandiose but makes sense. If you have more than a few early apples (as a rule, the later an apple ripens, the longer it will keep) then it seems a pity to waste them. A few shelves in a cool, dark place will give you apples well into the new year. </p> <p>Why would you want to grow them rather than buy them from a supermarket? How long have you got? For a start apples make a marvellous garden tree, ranging from a small semi-standard that you can prune to fit your space to a magnificent mature Bramley that will house a tree house, swing and dominate a garden. Their blossom is exquisite. They make an ideal setting for long grass and bulbs. Birds will sing in their branches. If space is tight you can train them into espaliers, step-overs or cordons. Oh and there is the fruit. An apple from your garden is gathered and eaten ripe, when the sugars are ready and not when the 'food producer' decides when they are fit to travel. You can choose from scores of readily available varieties and hundreds of rarer ones to have a real range of tastes and colours. </p> <p>And you can have trees with meaning. The other day Sarah came back from the Abergavenny food festival with a little booklet I had not seen before called Apples of the Welsh Marches. It told me both intimate, local details about apples I grow and whetted my appletite for others I do not. Take Crimson Quoining. I grow Crimson Queening which is a bright red, rather oblong early cooker with curious, ribbed, almost square, corners. In Payne Knight's Pomona Herefordshiensis it is called Old Quining and he says that it was a cider apple in the 17th century. The name comes from the quoins of a building, and now when I look at the apple I see the buttressed supports of Hereford cathedral. So the connection is made and life is richer for it.</p> <p>Now is a good time to order and plant apples. The interesting ones are likely to be bare root and available through mail order. When they arrive they should be heeled-in immediately and planted between now and the end of January. The starting point is to choose the right rootstock. No apple comes true from seed so they are all grafted on to a separate root. The top part, the graft, determines the fruit and leaves and the root will determine the size and vigour of the tree. So a M27 rootstock will never produce a tree much bigger than 6ft tall if it lived to be a 100 years old. Likewise, exactly the same variety on a M25 rootstock will always be straining to become a decent-sized tree. If the garden centre cannot tell you which rootstock they are selling, don't buy it. </p> <p><strong>Common rootstocks</strong> </p> <p><strong>M27 Very Dwarfing</strong> Ideal for containers, but needs rich soil. Needs support throughout its life.</p> <p><strong>M9 Dwarfing</strong> Makes for a small tree, 6-8ft tall, that crops from the second or third year. The fruit tends to be large and ripens earlier than identical varieties on bigger trees. Has brittle roots, so needs permanent staking. Good for cordons and containers but needs rich soil.</p> <p><strong>M26 Semi Dwarfing</strong> Used a lot in commercial orchards because it keeps small but produces early, large fruit. Will tolerate poorer soil than M9, but is a slow starter. Needs permanent staking. Can be used for espalier and cordons on good soils.</p> <p><strong>MM106 Semi Dwarfing</strong> Medium-sized tree that grows and crops well on most soils. Suitable for semi-standards (with a clear trunk of 4ft) or large bush-shaped trees. Crops heavily. Best for espalier or cordon trees in poorish soils.</p> <p><strong>MM111 Vigorous</strong> Ideal for standard or semi-standard trees, can resist potash deficiency in the soil and is notably drought resistant. </p> <p><strong>M25 Very Vigorous</strong> Suitable for large standards. A mature tree can produce 400lb of fruit.</p> <p><strong>Pollination</strong></p> <p>No apple is reliably self-fertile, so each tree needs a pollinator. A neighbour may well have an apple that will do that for you, but it is better to always plant at least two trees to be certain of pollination. Apples start flowering in April and continue to the end of May, each flower lasting for about a fortnight, so to pollinate each other they must overlap by as long as possible. This flowering is not random but a measured progression and categorised in groups numbered 1 to 7. Find out which group your desired apple is in and buy another either from the same group or one adjacent to it. So Egremont Russet from group 2 is not a good pollinator for Golden Delicious in group 5. A cooker will happily pollinate a dessert apple and in practise many highly desirable apples come from groups 2, 3 and 4. Some apples are triploid, which means that they need two other varieties to pollinate it. </p> <p>Apples hate strong wind and damp, cold soil so try and place them on well-drained, rich soil in a sheltered position. Plant bare-root and pot-grown trees alike into a hole a spade's depth deep and at least 3ft in diameter. Thoroughly loosen the subsoil and sides of the hole if compacted but do not add any organic material. Stake the tree before planting (the more dwarf the rootstock, the more it will need staking; very young standards on MM111 or M25 rootstocks need no stake) and plant so that the union between rootstock and graft is well above soil level. Firm the roots in thoroughly and give them a good soak. Mulch thickly with compost and keep an area up to 3ft in radius mulched and weed-free for the first five years or so. Winter pruning will stimulate growth and summer pruning (while the tree is still growing, so between the beginning of July and the end of September) will restrict it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:monty.don@observer.co.uk\">monty.don@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Its red brick town hall is a great place to start. It's an immense Renaissance building with great views over Piazza Maggiore which, with the adjoining Piazza Nettuno, is the focal point of city life. Bologna is full of lovely palaces, churches and museums housing some smashing art. Try the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Basilica di San Domenico and University museums. The city has 25 miles of covered arcades.</p> <p>Several other excellent destinations are close by. Parma is full of fine medieval palaces and its pedestrian-friendly parks and cobbled centre would make a great day trip.</p> <p>Modena, the home of tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Ferrari and a lovely Romanesque cathedral, is another treat.</p> <p>This region, Emilio-Romagna, is one of Italy's finest for locally produced food.

  "In his fading years, the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright embarked on a final grand project. Invited in 1957 by King Faisal of Iraq to design a new opera house, Wright expanded the brief into a plan for Baghdad complete with museums, parks, university and authentic bazaar. Dispensing with his 'prairie style', he peppered the scheme with domes, spires and ziggurats. <p>The 1958 revolution meant that none of it was built. But the ever-resourceful Wright simply offered the design to a new client. And today, the Baghdad opera house is the Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium at Arizona State University: an example of Wright's versatility and the forum for next week's presidential debate. Under the arches of a lost Iraqi skyline, George W Bush and John Kerry will meet in debate for the final time. </p> <p>It could scarcely be more appropriate in an election dominated by foreign affairs to an extent not seen since the Vietnam war. Friday night's second debate started and finished with WMD, the role of weapons inspectors and the use/misuse of intelligence. In the event, both sides walked away from St Louis, Missouri, with something to celebrate. </p> <p>In contrast to their first encounter, Bush, as one commentator put it, 'turned up': he was energetic, engaged, supple and often intelligible. Following on from Dick Cheney's highly effective blocking of John Edwards in the vice-presidential debate, the Republican tail-spin of the past few days has come to a halt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Kerry continued to look and sound presidential. As ever, he was authoritative and suitably aggressive - but, at last, he also gave something of himself. In a response to a question on abortion, he finally started to talk about his Catholic faith and break down some of that Brahmin reserve. Yet even if an instant poll gave Kerry a slim victory, he failed to deliver the knock-out. With only 23 days left to the election and Bush still fractionally leading, a decisive blow is what is needed for the final head-to-head. </p> <p>Here in Arizona, Kerry's strategy to focus so determinedly on foreign policy could play either way. This is a state on the domestic front-line in the 'war on terror', producing one of the most celebrated victims of the neo-conservative movement. </p> <p>Pat Tillman was an all-American hero, a graduate of Arizona State University who went on to play professional football for the Arizona Cardinals, only to forego a lucrative future with the NFL to enlist, alongside his brother, Kevin, as an Army Ranger. </p> <p>Laid-back and highly popular, he was the quiet warrior of America's global imperium. But after initial deployment in the Middle East, he was transferred to Afghanistan where, in April, he was killed by 'friendly fire'. </p> <p>Unlike the hundreds of other deaths, Tillman's sacrifice jolted the myopic complacency of US public opinion. Arizona went into mourning as the Cardinals retired his number 40 and 'Pat Tillman Freedom Plazas' were planned. </p> <p>But on his former campus, underground posters have started appear with the haunting refrain, 'Remember me?', asking whether 'I' needed to die for 'Bush's wars'. </p> <p>Despite the losses, it would take a substantial shift for this electorate to dismiss their commander-in-chief mid-war. Arizona is, after all, a state which grew rich in the post-war years on the back of the military-industrial complex. </p> <p>Its clear skies proved ideal for pilot training, drawing in high-tech firms in their wake. Today, it retains that martial spirit, with an array of military bases and culture of service - not least in the form of its popular senator, Vietnam veteran John McCain (whom many now regard as the leading Republican candidate for 2008). </p> <p>Moreover, since the 1950s Arizona has been seen as the birthplace of modern Conservatism. It was from this rugged landscape that Barry Goldwater emerged. His anti-government credo - 'Extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice' - set the modern Republican party on its course. Under Goldwater's guidance, power drifted from the Rockefeller moderates to the free market individualists of southern and western America. </p> <p>Although Goldwater lost catastrophically to Lyndon Johnson in 1964, his anti-Communist, laissez-faire ideals would triumph in Ronald Reagan. And now, in Bush, many Arizonans see a south-western compatriot ready to defend gun-ownership, gas-guzzling SUVs, and 'traditional values'. </p> <p>But while Bush continues to lead Kerry in Arizona by 10 points, hope is in the air for Democrats. Recent polls have shown a marked increase in undecided voters, as well as another 500,000 people registering to vote. And, in a state that only went Bush by 6 per cent in 2000, that could be enough to make the difference. </p> <p>The final debate is in theory focused on domestic policy, but will inevitably slide back towards Iraq. So far, one of the more effective tactics of the Kerry campaign has been to emphasise how America is bearing 90 per cent of the war's costs. This week, Kerry's challenge is to link that $200 billion expenditure to faltering economic confidence at home. </p> <p>The middle-class boom of the Clinton years is a thing of the past. House prices, college fees, health costs, even petrol prices are creating what Kerry exaggerates as 'a crisis of the middle class'. Those concerns, together with worries over the fiscal deficit and mounting unemployment, need to be connected in the popular imagination with the Iraqi war mismanagement. </p> <p>To do so, Kerry might follow the lead set by Goldwater's apprentice, Reagan. In his 1980 debate with President Carter, held amid another US foreign policy debacle in the Middle East and rising costs of living, Reagan suggested to his audience: 'It might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores? Is America as respected as it was?' </p> <p>Then, as now, the answer was 'no' and a one-term incumbent was ousted from office. This Wednesday, another act of regime change might be enacted under the arches and palm trees of a Baghdad skyline. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Tristram Hunt is a visiting professor at Arizona State University.</p>",
  "<p>When Colin Osborne found a lump on his testicle, he took no notice. He allowed the lump to grow. It started to hurt when he leant against his desk, but still he ignored it. According to new research, there was nothing abnormal about his response - he was simply doing what most men do when faced with a health problem. 'I'm not one to go to the doctor's,' Colin says. 'When I have a cold, I never take anything. The lump didn't bother me. I didn't discuss it. I thought it would go away. I have to be at death's door before I stop what I'm doing.'</p> <p>Colin, then aged 32, was at death's door, only he didn't realise it. By now two months had passed and Colin's wife Sandra begged him to visit his GP. 'I said: \"No, I'll leave it a couple of weeks.\"'</p> <p>Sandra made an appointment. Within two weeks everything had changed. Colin had testicular cancer. The cancer had spread to his lymph nodes. The surgeon reckoned the disease had been there for six months. Colin endured a gruelling regime of surgery, chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant. </p> <p>He suffered side effects, including a stroke and septicaemia. Had he sought help earlier, the condition would have been less advanced and the treatment less harsh. Dr Ian Banks, president of the Men's Health Forum, which promotes men's health, described Colin's attitude as 'typical'. More women than men get a malignant melanoma, yet more men die from it. The only explanation for this is that men seek medical help far too late. In fact, men are more likely to suffer premature death over all conditions that affect both sexes. </p> <p>The General Household Survey reveals that men consult GPs less often than women. In 2002 only 13 per cent of men saw a GP, as against 17 per cent of women. According to health psychologist Dr Sarah Grogan, who interviewed 115 men, wives and GPs on their health attitudes, men do not see health as a 'male' pursuit. Grogan, who presented her findings at a recent British Psychological Society conference, explained: 'Being ill was viewed by the men as shameful and \"unmanly\". Men are trained to be stoical and John Wayne-like.' And the men in the study delegated their day-to-day healthcare to their wives, viewing this as an extension of the nurturing role that women have. Alan White, professor of men's health at Leeds Metropolitan University, believes men relinquish control of their health at every stage. 'They give this role to their mothers and then their girlfriends, wives and sisters.' The message begins early - usually the mother takes the child to the doctor's. </p> <p>At school, peer pressure among teenage boys ensures that health concerns are not aired. A survey of 16-year-old boys found that almost none had ever made a doctor's appointment. 'The attitude continues into manhood. If you go into a pub and admit to having emotional problems or something wrong with your testicles, the reaction will be very negative indeed,' says White. </p> <p>Experts claim the media exacerbates the problem. When Tony Blair had chest pains, there were headlines asking: 'Why hasn't Cherie done more?' And women's magazines run articles entitled: 'Is your man eating properly?'</p> <p>'There is a lot of social pressure on women to take responsibility for men's health. It is absolutely unreasonable, especially when women have responsibility for their own, their children's and sometimes their parents' health,' says Grogan.</p> <p>And she warns that both women and health professionals 'collude' by encouraging men to see health as a female domain. The way the NHS is set up compounds the problem. Women access it for contraception advice, cervical screening and help with childbirth. But there is nothing in the new GP contract that requires the screening of men. As a result, men don't know when to consult, or fear that their condition is not severe enough to prompt investigation. Consequently, they devolve responsibility to their partners. </p> <p>Experts realise that if men are to become more responsible, then the health service needs to become more male-friendly. The Men's Health Forum is piloting schemes in which poster campaigns and talks take place in the workplace and at gyms, pubs, football grounds and barber shops. Banks has also published a series of health guides laid out in the style of the Haynes car manuals and sold in Halfords, among other manly outlets. The Forum is also urging pharmacists to have more man appeal. Simple tricks such as placing gadgets by the counter can make a difference. White says mobile health centres, a five-yearly health-screening programme and more access to health services via the internet would also help. In addition, he says boys need to be taught to take control of their own health from the start. Colin Osborne has taken this message on board and set up the Orchid Cancer Appeal, which distributes the Know Your Balls - Check Them Out video to schools.</p> <p>And boys would do well to heed the message, because the tide is turning. Currently one in 15 men aged 35 to 44 lives alone. This rises to one in five among the over-65s. By 2020 one in five of all men will be by themselves. If men do not take responsibility for their own health, the cost will be high indeed. </p> <p>'What was OK in the past may not be OK in the future,' warns White. 'Men must become more sophisticated at managing and monitoring their own health. After all, whose body is it anyway?'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Orchid Cancer Appeal can be reached on 020 7601 7808; <a href=\"http://www.orchid-cancer.org.uk\">orchid-cancer.org.uk</a>.

  "The young man on the mountain bike stares intently at the pavement as three men and three women in fluorescent yellow jackets walk by. His guilt speaks volumes: he is a drug dealer and the only thing he fears more than arrest is holy retribution. <p>Welcome to the remarkable world of Bristol's Prayer Patrol, a team of volunteers who regularly tour the city's most dangerous districts, aiming to convince gang members of the error of their ways. </p> <p>'We had to do something,' says Basil Dixon. 'The situation on the streets was absolutely terrible, with all the drugs and the guns and the prostitutes. Things were getting out of control.' </p> <p>Bristol's troubles have been well documented. They reached a horrific apogee last December, when 24 people had acid thrown over them in a revenge attack at a pub in St Paul's. One, Pauline Williams, received terrible burns to her face. </p> <p>The violence resurfaced in dramatic fashion last weekend. Two local women, Asha Jama, 25, and Donna Small, 22, were caught in the crossfire of the violence that has blighted the city for the past four years. They had met three men on Friday night at Bar III, a popular student hangout. They went on to the Cooler nightclub before accepting a lift home from the men in the early hours. </p> <p>But as soon as the Saab convertible left the club, it was tailed by a silver BMW. Minutes later a volley of shots shattered the car's windows. Jama was hit in the face, blinding her in one eye, and Small hit in the head. She has yet to recover consciousness. </p> <p>The three men ran off, but one later returned, driving the two injured women to Trinity Road police station. He then fled. None of the men has yet been traced. </p> <p>The shootings were a shock, not only because they involved two innocent parties, but because they came as Bristol appeared to be making giant strides towards ridding itself of its gun problem. </p> <p>Gun-related crime in Bristol has fallen by 55 per cent in the past year, bucking a national trend. </p> <p>Much of the credit for this decline can be taken by St Paul's itself, which last week won a commendation from the chief constable of Avon and Somerset - the first time an entire community has received such an award. </p> <p>'The community support has been fantastic,' says detective inspector Andy Williams. 'It's all very well arresting the people who are carrying the guns, but we have to destroy the culture that encourages young people to get hold of guns in the first place.' </p> <p>Last year Avon and Somerset police launched a number of initiatives under the Communities Against Guns umbrella to address the problem. Although it receives no police funding, the Prayer Patrol is seen as one of a number of these which have made the streets of St Paul's significantly safer. </p> <p>Started by local pastor Reverend Darwencia Palmer, the patrol consists of around 12 volunteers who walk through St Paul's up to four times a day. Their tactics have proved highly effective, particularly with Jamaican gang members, many of whom have strict religious backgrounds. The Prayer Patrol has been credited with a 60 per cent reduction in local crime and has now expanded beyond St Paul's. </p> <p>'We are a force of good to push out the evil of drugs and guns from the streets of Bristol,' says Palmer. 'But the patrol is not just about religion - it is more about self-esteem and self-respect and morality.' They are soon to rename themselves The Peacemakers to emphasise this point. </p> <p>'We have had our successes. One time I saw a man dealing blatantly, so I decided to start praying for him and be equally blatant. When I opened my eyes, all I could see were tears streaming down his face. A few days later, someone tried to shoot him in a club but the bullet missed and struck someone else. The next time I saw him he had changed his appearance, given up dealing and enrolled in college.' </p> <p>As the patrol passes the St Nicholas House pub - a magnet for some of the gang members despite the best efforts of the owners - members of the patrol warn The Observer 's photographer not to take any more pictures. 'They come here to relax. This is their private time and the people don't want to find themselves on film,' explains one member of the patrol. Then, almost as an afterthought, he adds: 'And a lot of them may well be dealing drugs.' </p> <p>In the city centre, police are out in force outside the nightclubs where Small and Jama met the men in the Saab. Detective sergeant David Reynolds hopes that by jogging a few memories, they will find a crucial lead: 'We now know the BMW was waiting for the Saab for some time. If you look about on the streets right now, everyone is going somewhere, everyone has a purpose. These people were just hanging around waiting. We are hoping they will have stuck in someone's mind for that reason.' </p> <p>The police say both groups of men were from outside the city. This, they say, was a battle involving gangsters from London or Birmingham </p> <p>Despite the progress they have made, detectives feel one of their biggest enemies is the legal system. Last year Reynolds received a commendation for bravery after he and a colleague chased and caught a man carrying crack cocaine and a gun. The man was sentenced to just three years. With time on remand, he will be back on the streets just a few months after appearing in court.</p>",
  "<p>Shares in the defence giant BAE Systems barely moved last week. This despite the kind of publicity that expensive consultants are paid top dollar to prevent: TV allegations of bribery; details of payments from a \u00a360 million slush fund to Saudi officials in pursuit of defence contracts; lifestyles that would have made Nebuchadnezzar blush; whistleblowers; front companies, and shady middlemen. </p> <p>Indeed, the wanton spending of the former Saudi defence minister Prince Turki bin Nasser and his family - the Rolls-Royces, the holidays, the shopping sprees requiring a chartered 747 to get the goodies home - were largely dismissed as a necessary evil. </p> <p>In other words, the importance of the contracts over which Prince Turki had control - the al-Yamamah defence deals signed between the UK and Saudi governments in 1985 and 1988 - to investors (and ministers and employees) far outweighed both the disgorging of some \u00a350-\u00a360m of shareholders' funds as a 'facilitation payment' and the knowledge that these funds were being spent in a way that could only harm the reputation of the company. </p> <p>Here are some comments: 'These allegations raise moral and ethical questions. But from our point of view, bearing in mind that al-Yamamah now brings in \u00a32 billion a year in servicing, and that with the original equipment order it could be up to \u00a350bn, the alleged payments of \u00a350m look small by comparison' - investment analyst. </p> <p>'Against the revenues for al-Yamamah, this [the payments] could be seen as \"working capital\".' - fund manager. </p> <p>Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon has decided not to make known his feelings about the issue. (Hoon knows the importance of BAE in marginal Labour seats, which is why he fought so hard to win the order for its Hawk jets to go to India and the RAF.) </p> <p>And this is pretty much the extent of the discussion. How can this be? Perhaps scruples over the recycling of shareholder funds to the jewellers of Bond Street and the bordellos of Soho can never be seen to be getting in the way of shareholder returns. But this is not the full story: there is plenty of criticism in the Square Mile of this kind of conduct. Ethical investment funds regularly jump up and down about it. Julia Dreblow, socially responsible investment manager for Friends Provident, says: 'We take a very dim view of companies that carry out their activities in a way that is not transparent - bribery and corruption tend to increase poverty and inequality and corrupt democracy.' But she does not have a view on the BAE case because it is an arms company. 'We do not invest in arms companies because they kill people.' </p> <p>So if you want to avoid criticism from investors for this kind of conduct, remember that it's fine if your main activity is unethical to start with. As for non-ethical investors, as one pithily put it: 'If the company is doing something inappropriate that will have financial consequences, then that is serious.' </p> <p>Serious it would be if BAE had broken the law. In the US, companies can come a serious cropper if they transgress the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977, designed to end a situation where 'more than 400 US companies admitted making questionable or illegal payments to foreign government officials'. In the UK, there were loopholes in dealings with foreign officials until the implementation of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 in February 2002. </p> <p>BAE points out that it acted in accordance with UK law and the laws of those countries in which it operated; that the contract was not between the company and Saudi Arabia, but between the two governments; and that there was no slush fund. Perhaps. But the Serious Fraud Office is investigating the allegations made in the Guardian and on BBC television last Tuesday, looking at the 2001 act and other law covering the issue of false accounting - which BAE also denies - with a view to possible criminal proceedings. </p> <p>BAE watchers both in the City and industry dismiss the financial significance of this. But, as Boeing found out last year, a criminal investigation (albeit in that case domestic) generally leads to a rolling of heads, and a spanking from the amoral marketplace for getting caught. Will the UK follow where America has led?</p> <p><strong> Why Allergy won't be catching a cold</strong></p> <p> Is now the time to launch a pharmaceuticals company onto the market? Problem one: the economy (oil at a historic high, a housing bubble and a slowdown). Problem two: distrust of the sector (dearth of blockbuster drugs, regulatory problems, consumer disquiet). </p> <p>Answer one: the worst has not yet happened in the markets, and the flotation window remains open. Answer two: Allergy Therapeutics, the company in question (floating this week on AIM with a \u00a350m expected price tag) is a small vaccines developer that is not under the same pressure as the GlaxoSmithKlines of this world. </p> <p>Doesn't that mean it's made up of uncommercial scientists with ideas for pills that will take years to make money? No. Allergy was profitable last year and has a small, but credible, pipeline of products. It was formed by a former banker who bought into GSK management, who believes he can take a slice of the $12bn vaccines market. Small British pharma firms have a good record. This will be worth watching.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Don Carlos</strong> <br>Crucible, Sheffield </p> <p><strong> Don Juan</strong><br>Lyric Hammersmith, London W6 </p> <p><strong> Brighton Rock</strong><br>Almeida, London N1 </p> <p>Michael Grandage has created a tremendous <strong> Don Carlos</strong>. In the past five years, as associate director of Sheffield Theatres, he has made a visit to the city essential for anyone who wants to see the best of the British stage: never has the Crucible seemed so well-named. In this, his valedictory production, he is at the top of his powers. </p> <p>No director takes an audience so directly to the heart of a play. Schiller's 1788 drama has always been a revered Enlightenment text, but its plot is a twisted, doubling-back-on-itself matter, involving the tyrannical King Philip II of Spain and the Netherlands; his son, Don Carlos - in love with the stepmother to whom he was once betrothed; and the idealistic Marquis of Posa, determined to liberate Philip's oppressed peoples. Here it's made to seem intricate, rather than awkwardly knotted; fired by intimate as well as political feeling. </p> <p>Christopher Oram's design is, as always in a Grandage production, crucial. It's transparent, never intrusive but, together with Paule Constable's crepuscular lighting, it steers the story, clarifying and deepening, without ever merely duplicating the dialogue. This is a production which drives without interruption from scene to scene but in which some moments are underlined: spotlit, and intensified by Adam Cork's ecclesiastical music. </p> <p>The ponderous pressure of the Church is established before the play opens, as a huge silver censer swings across the darkened stage. Terror takes on a physical form as Peter Eyre's Grand Inquisitor looms above the stage like a giant wasp, a hallucinogenic figure who might have buzzed down from a Mardi Gras float. The repression of the Court seeps from every perfectly judged movement of Claire Price's sad, poised Queen and her ladies-in-waiting: starchy, conventional Una Stubbs and the conniving, desperate Charlotte Randle. When they first come forward out of shadowy depths they glide like automata, each snap of a fan and swish of a skirt contributing to a complicated formal dance. </p> <p>There are fiery soap operatics in here: watch Randle's face as she slowly realises that her lust is unrequited. Mike Poulton's fine new translation echoes, without labouring, 21st-century arguments about terror, despotism and individual liberty. But it's the pinpoint characterisation that's most impressive. It's not only Richard Coyle's affecting Don Carlos who's troubled. Derek Jacobi's King Philip is equally disturbed: an autocrat whose ferocity feeds on sycophancy but who can rise to magnanimity when challenged. Jacobi gives one of the most subtle and commanding performances of his career. </p> <p>Neil Bartlett, artistic director of the Lyric Hammersmith for the last 10 years, is also bowing out with a Don. Bartlett has made a specialty of showing the subversive currents in familiar material: he's revealed a torrid Somerset Maugham, produced a sobering Oliver Twist . </p> <p>He directs his own translation of Moli\u00e8re's <strong> Don Juan</strong> with his feel for the voluptuous and decadent, relocating the action to an opulent hotel, a fin-de-si\u00e8cle affair of crimson carpet (handy for the Don's descent into hellfire) and glittering black marble. This design (Bartlett's own) fits easily into the Lyric's curvy Edwardian frame: as the deflating Sganarelle, Paul Ritter, who boldly sounds throughout as if he's ad lib bing, takes a moment out to admire the gilt moulding of the proscenium arch. </p> <p>James Wilby's Don is elegant but too languid to provide excitement. His bravura defence - that hypocrisy has become fashionable - now seems not so much outrageous as untrue, in an era when wrong-headed sincerity is a more lethal attribute. But there are pungent Bartlett touches, both sardonic and magical. As the Don writhes towards death, two maids he has seduced come forward to drop him down a trap door; their task accomplished, each primly smoothes out the seat of her uniform. The arrival of the Statue - a huge and glistening grey equestrian, with hollow voice - is thrilling as it takes shape from a black background as if conjured by a wizard. </p> <p>There's another descent into hell at the Almeida, where the story of Graham Greene's infernal hoodlum Pinkie has been adapted by Giles Havergal and set to music by John ( Goldfinger , Midnight Cowboy , Body Heat ) Barry. The question is why. </p> <p><strong> Brighton Rock</strong> - with its startling evocation of a dark and decayed seaside town, and its dubious better-damned-than-a-doubter theology - was a sensation when it appeared in 1938. It was made into a stage play and filmed unforgettably with an impassive Richard Attenborough, a riveting, wild Hermione Baddeley, and a host of threatening noir images. Now Attenborough's son Michael has directed this further version - brisk and clear, but far less so than its predecessors. </p> <p>Lez Brotherston's pretty design is some way short of seamy: the pier, with its lacy ironwork, droopy lamps and a fuss of period shop signs looks slightly foxed rather than irreparably tarnished. Barry's music - descending chords on clarinet and sax, a prancing deckchair number performed by bouncy Cockney coves - is never dangerous enough, and never rises to a big number: for much of the time a television might have been left on inadvertently in the background. But the real offender is Don Black, whose lyrics clump along, continually dragging the emphasis from the interesting gangland aspect of Greene's tale to the default mode of all musicals - romance: 'As soon as our eyes met, I didn't think what was right_' </p> <p>Havergal (hot-footing it from Don Juan , where he appears as a sepulchral dad) has done a neat job of filleting the novel. Michael Jib son is a memorable Pinkie, waxy-faced and intent, looking as if he's barely out of short trousers; as Rose, the waitress who falls for him, Sophia Ragavelas sings and moves with sweetness; Harriet Thorpe gives Ida - the blousy force of nature who saves a life (though it's creepily not clear how creditable Greene considers this is, compared to saving souls) - gusto and creamy allure. But nothing can disguise the fact that this is one makeover too far.</p>",
  "<p>Acid rain is still devastating a large part of Britain's landscape despite 20 years of intense efforts to halt its effects. </p> <p>Scientists have found that although there has been a dramatic fall in emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from factories and power stations, major increases in pollution from tankers and container ships have wiped out many of the gains. </p> <p>The discovery has caused particular alarm because prospects of controlling pollution from ocean-going ships are limited compared with controls that can be introduced on land. </p> <p>'People think acid rain is no longer a problem but that is not true,' said Professor David Fowler of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Edinburgh. 'Yes, there have been significant improvements in the east, particularly in England, where depositions of sulphur dioxide have halved. </p> <p>'But in the west and in Wales and most of Scotland there have no significant improvements des-pite everything that has been done.' </p> <p>Acid rain became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the early green movement in the Seventies when it was discovered that sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emitted by factories and power stations were falling to Earth, dissolved in rainwater that had become acidic in the process. </p> <p>Massive destruction of trees in central Europe, the pollution of streams and rivers in Wales, Scotland and Scandinavia and the deaths of fish in European lakes were all blamed on acid rain. Widespread ecological destruction was predicted. </p> <p>In those days three million tonnes of sulphur dioxide was pumped into the atmosphere every year in Britain. But by switching from coal, a sulphur-rich fuel, to gas, which has virtually no sulphur, and by installing 'scrubbers' to clean factory and power station emissions, a cut of 80 per cent in acid rain pollution was achieved in the Eighties. </p> <p>An acid-free future was predicted, and after almost two decades of these reductions scientists decided it was time to check how different areas had responded to the lower emissions. 'We got a real surprise,' said Fowler. 'In some areas, the worst affected by acid rain, there was no improvement whatsoever, despite all the efforts that had been made.' </p> <p>Lakes and streams in south-west England, most parts of Wales and large areas of Scotland were still stripped of fish, river birds and aquatic insects that used to thrive on their banks and waters. Yet in eastern and central England, where many of the country's main power stations and factories are based, there had been a considerable improvement. Lakes and streams there were beginning to recover. </p> <p>So why the difference? Suspicion fell on marine fuels, which are rich in sulphur. In addition, international shipping has risen considerably in the past decade and is likely to go on doing so. </p> <p>In 1990 a total of 16.4m tonnes of sulphur dioxide was pumped into the air by factories and power plants in the European Union. At the same time, shipping in the Baltic, North Sea and north Atlantic accounted for 2m tonnes. By 2000 the figures were 5.8m and 2.6m, and by 2010 they are expected to be 3.9m and 3.3m. So marine sources of sulphur dioxide accounted for 10 per cent of the acid rain in Europe in 1990 but by the end of the decade they will be responsible for 45 per cent. </p> <p>An identical analysis of nitrogen oxides pumped out by ocean-going ships shows a similar drop in land-based output and a steady rise in marine pollution. Wafted by the prevailing south-west winds that blow across Britain, clouds of sulphur and nitrogen oxides generated by ships sailing across the north Atlantic are drifting over the west coast and falling as acid rain, blocking the improvements made in the east of this country. </p> <p>'Some of these ships are huge, like great power stations on the waves, and they can produce vast amounts of sulphur and nitrogen oxides,' said Fowler. </p> <p>The discovery is a major headache, not just for Britain but for the EU, because shipping in the Baltic, Mediterranean and North Sea is also generating acid rain which is falling over other nations. However, there are no effective treaties to control the emissions of ships on international waters, a point stressed in the recent report Impacts of pollution from outside the EU on Europe's environmental targets , published by the European Academies Science Advisory Council. Only concerted action by the EU and the United Nations will stop the ecological mayhem. </p> <p>'It's clearly a problem,' added Fowler. 'Until we control what's going on in the ocean we are never going to be free of the blight of acid rain.'</p>",
  "They came from opposite corners, striding to the centre to meet for a brief but firm handshake. Then President George Bush and John Kerry retreated to their chairs. They would not look each other in the eye again for 90 minutes. <p>When the second presidential debate was over, it was Bush who was probably happier. 'Thank you all very much. It's been enjoyable,' he said. He needed a result, and as America digests the St Louis debate it seems he got it. Just. The two men had faced each other in a converted university gym - two political prizefighters. Bush was entering Round Two of the presidential match with a bloody nose. Round One in Florida eight days earlier had left his campaign in disarray. In just one evening of verbal jousting - and Bush's sourness and scowling - Kerry had hauled himself back into the race. A slew of national polls showed him narrowly behind the President or drawing level. One even showed him ahead. That was compounded by repeated bloody attacks in Iraq and the final word on Saddam's weapons of mass destruction: they did not exist. </p> <p>The fight for the White House was suddenly back on. Kerry had retired to a Colorado hotel, where staff built a mock-up of the St Louis auditorium in the resort's ballroom. His longtime friend, lawyer Greg Craig, played the part of Bush. But the real Bush had been busy too. Top aides sat with him as they poured over videos of the Florida debacle and showed him how his facial contortions had played so badly across the televisions of America. By the time he entered the highly-controlled environment of the St Louis debate he was fully prepared. He knew a repeat of Florida could cripple his attempt to win a second term. </p> <p>The fight began at a furious pace. The first questioner, from an audience of handpicked potential wavering voters, asked Kerry to defend himself against being 'wishy-washy'. Kerry's response was to jab straight at Bush. 'The President didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception,' he jibed. </p> <p>Bush hit right back, accusing Kerry of changing his opinion on a host of topics, but especially the war in Iraq. 'I can see why people think he changes position quite often. Because he does.' Game on. </p> <p>Spin alley in St Louis was a converted practice gym where the painted lines on the wooden basketball courts were covered by the cables of computers and TV cameras. It was here that top aides from both campaigns collared journalists to try and spin their side's point of view. But Spin Alley is also a state of mind. Few debates turn on any single moment. The fight to declare a winner goes on for at least 48 hours after the 90 minutes are up. Public opinions form in days, not minutes, and it is in Spin Alley that the first shots are fired in that media battle. </p> <p>Even before the debate was finished, campaign staffers were pouring into the room. By the time it was over, a sea of placards filled the floor. Dotted here and there were the orange signs indicating one of the big sharks in the room, emblazoned with the surname of Bush's political gurus Karl Rove and Karen Hughes. They moved through the masses crying victory. 'The President dominated this debate tonight. He clearly won,' Hughes declared. But the Democrats were out in force too, hitting the airwaves and working the room. They took shots at Bush's performance. 'He lost his control,' said Democrat National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe. 'He doesn't know there is a problem, so he can't fix it,' mocked top staffer Joe Lockhart. </p> <p>But the beginnings of a consensus were soon starting to emerge. There had been no knockout blow for either side. Honours were even. But that meant Bush had won through to keep on fighting. In Republican terms, that was enough for a celebration. Bush has probably now stopped the collapse that at times last week seemed about to swamp his campaign. </p> <p>It had not begun that way. The war in Iraq had dominated the first 40 minutes of the debate, and Bush had seemed perilously close to losing his temper. Kerry began aggressively. '[Saddam] didn't have weapons of mass destruction,' he bluntly told the audience. 'The world is more dangerous today because the President didn't make the right judgments.' </p> <p>As Bush struggled not to frown or smirk or grimace, it seemed as if Florida Mark II was about to play itself out. Kerry followed up by mentioning Bush's father in a clever ploy designed to press the son's psychological buttons. A few seconds later, when Kerry had finished slamming Bush's lack of allies in Iraq, Bush stormed forward, cutting off the moderator's attempts to move the debate forward. 'You tell Tony Blair we're going alone!' Bush almost shouted, his voice rising with emotion. </p> <p>But if Bush was fighting to keep his self control, it was a fight he won. Kerry seemed slightly taken aback by Bush's outburst, and Bush followed up by going on the attack himself, lambasting Kerry as someone who would seek international permission for America's actions. It was a tactic that gradually put Kerry on the defensive. Bush switched into campaign mode, trotting out a familiar portrait of Kerry as a wimp who could not be a commander-in-chief and keep America safe. Bush was now speaking in a soft and folksy tone, turning up the Texas twang. The anger was under control. 'I don't think my opponent has the right view about the world to make us safe, I really don't,' he said. </p> <p>Then, as the debate switched to domestic matters, Bush gradually displayed an increasing mastery of the 'town hall' format of the St Louis debate. He prowled around the hall for every question, often even standing as Kerry spoke. He looked directly at the questioners, thanking them by name. He seemed at ease. It was a style familiar to any who have followed Bush on the campaign trail. Though, of course, it did not prevent him from making the usual handful of verbal blunders, such as referring to a rumour about reinstating the draft on the 'internets'. </p> <p>Yet Kerry is no slouch at town hall debates either. Almost two years of campaigning in primaries and for the White House have left him at home in public meetings. The debate settled down into a detailed discussion of taxes and healthcare. </p> <p>For Bush it must have been a relief, and he began to deliver a scathing attack on Kerry's 20 years as a senator, painting him as a tax-and-spend liberal out of touch with mainstream America. Bush began to seize the initiative and deliver the campaign 'zingers' dreamt up the previous week. 'He's got a record. He's been there 20 years. You can run, but you can't hide,' Bush said. </p> <p>Several times Kerry implored the audience at home to see through the image Bush was painting. 'The President is just trying to scare everyone here, throwing labels around,' he said. 'Labels don't mean anything.' </p> <p>Then came the moment which may be remembered no matter who wins the White House. A questioner asked Kerry if he would vow to camera never to raise taxes on middle-class America, raising the spectre of the elder Bush's 'Read my lips, no new taxes' pledge. Kerry took the bait. 'Yes. Right into the camera. Yes, I am not going to raise taxes,' Kerry said. </p> <p>By now Bush was relaxed and joking with the audience. 'Of course he's going to raise your taxes,' he laughed. Kerry became increasingly long-winded. On a question about government funding for abortion, Kerry gave a monologue on the ethical complexities of the issue and his own personal morality. Bush got up. 'I'm trying to decipher that [answer],' he said, shaking his head with a shrug 'My answer is we are not going to spend taxpayers' money on abortion.' A few Democrats sitting in Spin Alley noticeably winced. By the time the debate was finished, both sides in Spin Alley had enough to plausibly claim victory. Kerry had not suffered any killer blows, but he did not deliver any either. </p> <p>Bush recovered from his poor start to take control, and ended the stronger. For Bush a draw after Florida was enough to be called a win. </p> <p>What emerged most strongly was how starkly different the candidates are. Audience member Bren Pathenos, who said she came out of the chamber favouring Bush, had met both candidates after the contest. She had told them of her son serving in Iraq. While Bush had asked her to send her son his regards, saying 'Good job', Kerry had promised to work for the day when her son could be brought home. Here were two very different visions of the war. </p> <p>With less than a month to go, only one thing is clear: America remains divided. And undecided. The debates have had an impact in levelling the playing field again. Spin Alley still has work to do on shaping the result of the St Louis fight, but it is unlikely that the fundamental pattern will shift. Nor is it likely to change after the final debate this week in Arizona. 'The first poll after the last debate will be very instructive as to the future of the rest of the race,' said Ken Warren, a political scientist at St Louis University. 'I expect it to be virtually a dead heat.' </p> <p>As the candidates prepare for the final stretch, each is still seeking desperately to land one knockout blow. </p> <p><b>War of words</b></p> <p><b> The Bush view</b> </p> <p><b>On abortion </b><br> 'We're not going to spend taxpayers' money on abortion ... Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.' </p> <p><b>On Iraq</b><br> 'I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.' </p> <p><b>On healthcare</b><br> 'I've been in Washington DC three-and-a-half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so that our seniors have got a modern health system. </p> <p><b>On the economy</b><br> 'He's going to tax everybody here to fund his programmes. That's just reality.' </p> <p><b> The Kerry view</b> </p> <p><b>On abortion</b><br> 'I think it's important for the US not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families to be able to make a smart decision about family planning.' </p> <p><b>On Iraq</b><br> 'The world is more dangerous today because the President did not make the right judgments.' </p> <p><b>On healthcare</b><br> 'Five million people have lost their health insurance under this President. He's done nothing about it.'</p> <p><b>On the economy</b><br> 'Now, the President has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs. The first President in 72 years to lose jobs.'</p>",
  "Busted have called it for Michael Howard. Not since Norman Lamont declared ' je ne regrette rien' over ERM have the Tories planted such a musical milestone. Supporters more culturally at home with the former Chancellor's Edith Piaf moment need not worry, though. <p>Even those who have never heard of Britain's favourite boy band will recognise Matt Jay's allegiance to the small state and modest personal taxation. Or, as Mr Jay put it in Tatler magazine: 'Yeah, actually, you know what, I am not going to be ripped off any more. From the financial position I am in now, I am a fucking Tory boy too.' </p> <p>Once such language would have gone down badly in the shires, but a party that has embraced Liam Fox's passion for Scissor Sisters must be getting inured to shock. And anyway, tastes change. While Kenny Everett's cry of 'Let's bomb Russia' elicited cheers at the Tory conference of 1983, something more hip is needed now. Though Rick Wakeman bravely filled the gap, he is, alas for right-wing cool, not much prettier than the thought of Nicholas Soames's first kiss. </p> <p>Personalities are essential to personal politics, and the Busted coup gives the Tories a fillip in a domain where, barring the Spice Girls' dalliance with Thatcherism, the liberal left has traditionally had the best cheerleaders. Springsteen sings for Kerry while Bush has to settle for Britney in a realm in which stars and politicians have fed off one another's variable lustre ever since JFK annexed Sinatra. The roll call of collusion is long and unsurprising: Nixon and Elvis; Major and Cilla; Blair and Blur. </p> <p>Now, like prions conniving at a mad cow epidemic, the categories are jumping species. At Labour's conference, Bono announced Gordon Brown and Tony Blair as the 'Lennon and McCartney of politics'. The U2 singer, never a mere party groupie, has been elevated to an international ambassador more beguiling, and in many ways more powerful, than premiers and presidents. </p> <p>While celebrities, from Reagan to Schwarzenegger, have moved into politics, convention decrees that they first bother to get elected. Now a different blend of celebrity and politician is emerging. The new hybrid strain of celebrician needs nothing more than an assumption of popular support, plus a knit-your-own mandate. Its first prophet is Bob Geldof. </p> <p>Even counting Alan Titchmarsh, Sir Bob is the most influential man in Britain. Having spent last week saving Africa, he will this week redraft family policy, introducing new legislation where required. Tomorrow, in the first of his prime-time, hour-long programmes on Channel 4, Geldof deals with marriage. The second, to be shown on Tuesday, is about fathers. </p> <p>Geldof is well-informed on Africa. Far from showboating at Blair's side, he had to overcome some government resistance to founding the Commission for Africa which has placed the continent back on the international agenda before the start of Britain's G8 presidency. The architect of Live Aid has also helped shift the politics of pity to those of justice. </p> <p>Geldof has not always been tactful, though, or right. His description of George W Bush as one of Africa's best friends in its fight against Aids and famine appalled aid agencies, and his charge last week that an EU aid official was 'talking out of his arse' will have made him enemies as well as friends. As David Mepham, of the Institute for Public Policy Research, says, the test of the Geldof vision, and the presidency, will be whether G8 countries can be made to revise rigged trade rules. </p> <p>If Geldof is broadly sound on Africa, the same cannot be said for his family values. Though Geldof on Marriage sounds more convincing than, say, Christina Aguilera on unified theory, one failed spell of matrimony does not justify the authority he assumes, or explain the drivel he produces. It is hard to find anything kind to say about a programme whose chief concession to feminism is the bit where Geoff Mulgan, the Number 10 strategist, has his attention drawn to 'a fucking great billboard of a girl's beautiful arse in a thong'. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Geldof appears to pin the breakdown of marriage on women 'sucked into the workplace' and thus unavailable to give a man what he wants, which is his tea on the table ('so sexy, so feminine') after a hard day's work. While dismissing the notion of marriage as 'happy couples shagging on the kitchen table', Geldof sketches an equally odd model of breadwinner husbands and tractable wives who should put up and shut up, since divorce will very possibly leave their children condemned to prison, suicide or failure. </p> <p>Materialism and an inflated sense of self (to which Geldof is obviously a total stranger) have led us, he concludes, to become 'voracious consumers of the soul' who ignore the biological determinism dictating that men are surly and that women should try harder to understand them. The sexes, he points out, are very different. </p> <p>Except in part two of the Geldof exposition, in which men are just like women and must therefore have a 50 per cent share of their children, post-divorce. While experts, such as Carol Smart of Leeds University, have done exhaustive studies showing that children dislike such rigid arrangements, Geldof is right to say that some caring fathers are unfairly excluded, as he once was. </p> <p>The problem is that neglectful or even dangerous men who leave their families in penury seem not to exist. Domestic violence is little more than an anti-dad ploy dreamed up by women, as is sexual abuse of children. A retired judge is called upon to conclude, airily, that 'not a lot' of abuse claims sound correct. Behind this sinister agenda, there are some genuine grievances. Family courts are, it is true, too slow, and fathers' roles are often-undervalued. </p> <p>But the Geldof remedies are either draconian or risible, or both. Anyone for much tougher divorce, or life-means-life marriages, imposed by a state whose interference Geldof, in general, detests? </p> <p>The Fred Flintstone school of family policy will find favour with no politicians other than hardline Tories. If anyone told Busted about it, they might be off to join Respect. But because Geldof is whitewashed with veneration, he has no trouble attracting politicians as talking heads. There are parts for Alan Milburn, discussing the role of the stay-at-home dad (retired) and for Margaret Hodge, who - almost alone of Geldof's expert witnesses - has the boldness to imply that he is talking garbage. </p> <p>Obviously, there is nothing to stop Geldof rewriting family law on television, as long as someone is daft enough to offer him the airtime to do it. His polemics may even have the useful side-effect of reminding voters that timid, equivocal politicians are more useful than they sometimes seem. </p> <p>None the less, it is depressing that the same shoddy, quick-fix values Geldof deplores give him his licence to disinter a way of living that expired half a century ago, and to sell his credo with the confidence of an honorary statesman. As George Michael sang, during his own mercifully brief flirtation with political doggerel, 'it's like we're getting fresh out of democratic'. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@observer.co.uk\">mary.riddell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Chaos was enveloping Afghanistan's fragile presidential election last night after all 15 candidates challenging Hamid Karzai declared they were boycotting the poll over alleged voter fraud. <p>UN and Afghan officials rejected the call, insisting that difficulties involving indelible ink did not warrant abandoning the historic vote. </p> <p>The controversy surfaced within hours of polls opening yesterday morning, when voters in several areas complained that ink used by election officials to stain people's fingers - to prevent multiple voting - easily rubbed off. </p> <p>The possibility of fraud has dogged the Afghan election since thousands registered to vote several times, thinking their vote cards would bring them money or free food. </p> <p>'This vote is a fraud,' said Abdul Satar Sirat, the Uzbek candidate who rallied the complainants. 'It should be stopped. We don't recognise the results.' </p> <p>But officials with the joint UN-Afghan body organising the poll rejected the call. 'Halting the vote at this stage is unjustified and would deny these people their right to vote,' said vice-chairman Ray Kennedy. The election cost $20m to organise and at least 12 Afghan officials have been murdered by the Taliban. </p> <p>The UN focused the blame on poorly-trained officials who, they said, had used an ink intended to mark ballot papers - instead of the indelible one - as the anti-fraud device. But millions of Afghans still flooded to the polls, bringing with them hopes that the ballot box would mark the closing chapter of a 25-year saga of bloodshed, war and suffering. </p> <p>At 7.55am, 70-year-old Mohammed Zaffar cast his vote in the battered village of Chuquri, which has seen a century's worth of battles. British colonists, Soviet soldiers and black-turbaned Taliban have marched, bombed or shot their way through this mud-walled, hilltop hamlet. </p> <p>'I prayed, had breakfast and came here. I thought about who to vote for on the way,' explained Zaffar. </p> <p>Behind him, a trickle of men braved the sharp morning chill to enter the barbed wire voting enclosure. Some arrived by donkey, others drove herds of sheep. </p> <p>Over 100,000 US, Nato-led and Afghan security forces had been placed on high alert across the country as voters streamed into bombed-out schools, health clinics and mosques to choose among 16 candidates, of whom the favourite was the charismatic interim president Karzai. </p> <p>But celebration bells were muted by the eruption of the fraud row that could yet scupper the vote. Despite repeated threats of violence Taliban insurgents failed to terrorise the vote, although there were several foiled attacks - on Friday a bomb-sniffing dog discovered a petrol tanker laden with 40,000 litres of fuel, rigged with anti-tank mines, and intended for detonation in Kandahar, a Defence Ministry spokesman said. </p> <p>But while some stations were crowded, others were virtually empty. Polling got off to a sluggish start at rural stations like Chuquri where, 90 minutes after voting started, only about 60 men and no women had voted. </p> <p>'They will come later. Some people have to walk for hours to arrive, and the weather is very cold,' predicted returning officer Dr Muhammad Zahir. But fear may have also been a factor. Taliban had posted 'night letters' in Chuquri the night before, threatening to fire rockets into the booths. </p> <p>Inexperience and bias also affected the poll. The Chuquri station opened late while officials struggled to position polling booths and set up registration tables. Zahir, who openly announced his preference for Karzai, accompanied several older voters inside the curtained booth. 'They cannot read or write so I am just showing them the photos,' he explained. </p> <p>In Kabul a dust storm on Friday blanketed the capital in a thick haze seen by some as an ill omen. But the interim president Karzai maintained an upbeat tone. 'It is not important who wins,' he said as he cast his vote under tight security in the prime minister's office. 'The people are choosing their destiny and eventually if I win or any other one, the victory will be of the Afghan people.' </p> <p>As polls started to close at around 4pm yesterday, most of the political focus was on the controversy over ink and possible fraud. </p> <p>Abdul Wahab, 45, sat with other disabled voters outside the Maraston Hostel in Kabul for war-wounded or widowed families. Wahab, who lost a leg stepping on a landmine five years ago, hobbled across a busy road on a pair of crutches to cast his vote. </p> <p>Like many, he refused to disclose his preference, but stressed he was banking on the election to pull his country out of the chaos wrought by Soviet occupation, the Taliban and then the US invasion after 11 September. </p> <p>'Now people realise we have to use a pen instead of a gun. That's the new fight,' he said, pointing to his 12-year-old son Qais. 'Look at him. He was born in war. Now I want a bright future for him.'</p>",

Several apparently underage girls were also lining up to vote. </p> <p>Jawid Danishyar, a monitor with the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, criticised the poll's hasty preparation. 'The public awareness campaigns and training for officials were not good. Even now, people are not sure how to vote,' he said. </p> <p>Other areas also reported a peaceful, if glitch-prone, poll.

  "<p>Geore Bush has got my fingerprints. It did not take him, or rather his genial representatives at Dulles airport, long. What took the time was a two-hour wait in the passport queue to reach him. A number of us aliens will have something to say next time a US official or economist lectures us on the need for structural reform and greater flexibility in Europe. </p> <p>I imagine the Chancellor of the Exchequer had an easier passage through passport control, and I have no idea whether his fingerprints were taken too, just in case he might despair of ever winning approval for his ambitious schemes for relieving poor countries of their debt, and be tempted to take up terrorism instead. </p> <p>For James D Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank and one of the stars of last weekend's annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, terrorism and poverty are closely connected. 'Recent research suggests that a lack of economic opportunity, and the resulting competition for resources, lies at the root of most conflicts over the last 30 years, more than ethnic, political and ideological issues,' says Wolfensohn. </p> <p>The retiring president adds: 'T'his research supports the intuitive idea that if people have jobs, and if they have hope, they are less likely to turn to violence.'</p> <p>Gordon Brown did not get nearly as far as he would have liked last week with his 'debt initiatives'. It was not just recalcitrant Germans who were the problem. An official involved commented: 'The US won't budge. Apart from anything else, the IMF itself has a financing problem, and is not going to sell gold to finance the Chancellor's debt-relief plans.' </p> <p>We shall see. Group of Seven finance ministers referred the various proposals for further study. The Bush administration is more interested in debt relief for Iraq, where unemployment is said to be well over 50 per cent, and evidence that the US/UK invasion has created a breeding ground for terror becomes stronger by the day. </p> <p>Although he did not get far on debt, the Chancellor was widely praised for his handling of the IMF's key policy committee, of which he is a chairman. At the subsequent press conference he expressed surprise that there had been no questions about oil, because, without doubt, oil was one of the key topics at official meetings and fringe seminars. </p> <p>Those with long memories will recall that the Third World debt crisis began after the 'oil shocks' of the 1970s. What used to happen at IMF meetings in those days was that governments would encourage the 'recycling' of the spare millions (even billions) that the newly rich oil-exporting countries had to invest, and bankers - eager to make a turn - would not ask too many questions about the viability of African economies to which they offered money. </p> <p>It was the financial markets' rather belated discovery that Britain possessed North Sea oil that led to an embarrassing surge in the pound in 1977, within months of Denis Healey's having to turn back at the airport to face a major sterling crisis. (He never got to the 1976 IMF meeting. They sent a team to him.) </p> <p>My sense of last weekend's meetings is that there is an atmosphere of suppressed panic about the oil price, and about the danger of a serious crisis. This is over and above the well-publicised concerns about potential storms in the foreign-exchange markets when the financial world finally becomes nervous about the mani festly unsustainable US budget and balance-of-payments deficits - a nervousness which may well surface shortly after the presidential election. </p> <p>Oil prices loomed large in the statement by G7 finance ministers and central-bank governors, which conceded: 'Oil prices remain high and are a risk. So first, we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices remain moderate. Second, it is important consumer nations increase energy efficiency. Third, it is important for consumers and producers that oil markets function efficiently and we encourage the IEA (International Energy Agency) to enhance its work on oil data transparency.' </p> <p>The call for 'adequate supplies' is an obvious sign of concern. The call for increased efficiency contrasts with all those complacent analyses we have seen recently suggesting that the world is much less vulnerable to an oil shock that it was in the 1970s and 1980s. Efficiency? According to the US Energy Information Administration, US oil consumption rose by 16 per cent between 1973 (the year of the first oil shock) and 2003, whereas in France it dropped 21 per cent. (France, of course, invested heavily in nuclear energy.) </p> <p>I am not forecasting that oil prices are going to remain at $50 a bulk barrel or even rise a lot higher. But the fear is there. And I can report that the price of oil has been obsessing Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. One regular visitor to his office said that, although the chairman's desk was covered as usual by sta tistical papers, this time they were not about interest rates but oil. </p> <p>The other big worry in Washington was the poor performance of business investment in recent years, at a time when, in the words of one official, 'consumers have been spending virtually everything they have, and the savings rate is down to 1 per cent'. </p> <p>'The reasons are not economic,' said one senior official on the investment scene. 'When people are depressed, they go out and spend,' is one popular explanation, and there was much talk of the impact of those notorious Enron-style scandals on the animal spirits of businessmen. </p> <p>But to return to oil - because everybody I met seemed to return to oil. While officials tried endlessly to place their faith in the improved techniques of the oil industry and better extraction results from individual fields, the fear of terrorism was marked. </p> <p>Back in England, the first items of economic news to grab one's attention were the poor recent figures for industrial production here, and the warning by the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, that the oil price posed threats to the already very modest recovery of the eurozone.</p> <p>Oh, and by the way, I only had my fingerprints taken once, but at Washington National Airport, on my way to interview Professor Galbraith, I was told at the security desk: 'Your airline has selected you for additional screening.' There was the option of enjoying this extra privilege in private. What, in George Bush's America? They must be joking.</p>",
  "Serious questions were raised last night over the scientific evidence used by the government to reject claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and regressive autism in children. <p>A US paediatrician, Dr F Edward Yazbak, told The Observer that a study of more than 500,000 Danish children, regarded as the definitive analysis of the vaccine, should not be interpreted as ruling out a link between the jab and an increase in autism in Denmark. </p> <p>UK government health officials have consistently referred to the 2002 study, sponsored by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to attack claims of a link between autism and the three-in-one vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. </p> <p>But Yazbak said his examination of the Danish data showed it could not be used to reject a link. </p> <p>The study investigated 537,304 children born between 1991 and 1998. In Denmark, autism is normally diagnosed in children aged five or older. Many of those born after 1994 would not have been diagnosed by the time the study had concluded, Yazbak said. </p> <p>'The most important age group to look at comprises children aged from five to nine. The number with autism increased from 8.38 per 100,000 before the MMR jab was introduced in 1987, to 77.43 in 2000.' Writing in the latest edition of the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, Yazbak and Dr Gary Goldman, concluded: 'The systematic error of missing a large number of autism diagnoses in the later years was a major shortcoming. </p> <p>'Children with Asperger's syndrome and high-functioning autism, who have minimal speech and behaviour impairments and are thus not diagnosed as early as more profoundly affected children, are especially likely to be undercounted in this study.' </p> <p>Dr Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet and author of a new book MMR, science &amp; fiction said neither Yazbal's work or the Danish study could be used to prove or reject a link. 'There is a real danger of taking single studies in isolation and drawing conclusions one way or the other,' Horton said. </p> <p>British doctor Andrew Wakefield first raised concerns about MMR in 1998 when he published a study based on just 12 children who had been referred to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London, for gastrointestinal problems. </p> <p>Wakefield's findings prompted him to consider whether there was a link between the MMR vaccine and autism and bowel disease, but the study was widely rejected by scientists. </p> <p>Health campaigners blame the controversy for a decline in the number of children receiving the jab. Experts said there was a need to look at other explanations for the apparent rise in autism. Richard Mills, director of services of the National Autistic Society, said: 'There is an argument that rates of autism have not increased significantly but the diagnostic techniques and definitions have become more sophisticated. More research needs to be done.' </p> <p>Yazbak pointed to newly published figures from the US that show 140,920 children aged six to 21 were diagnosed with autism last year, compared with 12,222 in 1993. 'You cannot keep saying the diagnostic criterion has changed when the diagnostic criterion was changed in the US in 1994, and we are in 2004.' </p> <p>Yazbak denied his research proved a link between MMR and autism. But he said that, until further clinical research had been conducted, governments should offer a choice between single vaccines and the triple jab. A smaller study, published in the Lancet earlier this month, corroborated the Denmark findings. It looked at the vaccination records of 1,294 children diagnosed with autism and other disorders. The report also based its analysis on four other research projects and found no link.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists are developing techniques aimed at taming the power of the world's most devastating storms. The project, backed by funds from Nasa, would involve seeding clouds, coating seas with biodegradable 'slicks' and even beaming microwave radiation from orbiting power stations to slow or even halt hurricanes. </p> <p>Controlling these great, rolling tempests - known as hurricanes in the Atlantic, typhoons in the western Pacific and cyclones in the eastern Pacific - is now considered an urgent priority. Last month Hurricane Ivan killed more than 70 people and destroyed thousands of homes, miles of roads, swaths of vegetation and scores of hotels as it swept over Grenada, Jamaica, Tobago, the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and finally Cuba. Three similar recent storms caused the same kind of devastation, and meteorologists predict the next two decades will see increases in numbers and severity of hurricanes. Global warming is likely to worsen the problem. </p> <p>'Nothing stands in the way of hurricanes,' says Ross Hoffman, in the current issue of Scientific American. 'But must these fearful forces be forever beyond our control?' The answer is 'no', he adds, for one day they could be controlled thanks to developments in computing, satellite technology and material sciences. </p> <p>Backed by Nasa funds, his team of scientists at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a research and development consulting firm, have created computer simulations of past hurricanes, including Hurricane Iniki which caused enormous damage to the Hawaiian island Kauai in 1992, and Hurricane Andrew, which devastated south Florida in the same year. To their surprise they found that by making only relatively small changes to temperatures and other meteorological variables they could induce major alterations in its path and behaviour. Slight tinkering sent Iniki on a route that missed Kauai, for example. 'The question is: how can such perturbations be achieved?' asks Hoffman. </p> <p>The team has proposed several answers. One is to coat the ocean in front of a hurricane with a biodegradable oil which would slow the evaporation of water from the sea surface, depriving the developing storm of its sustenance. Another technique is to seed the eyes of hurricanes with silver iodide crystals, speeding formation of ice from water vapour. Spread by aircraft, these seed clouds could cause hurricanes to dissipate, although the group acknowledges that early tests have been only partially successful. </p> <p>The ultimate technique would be the construction of a flotilla of orbiting power stations that would collect the Sun's rays and beam them to Earth as microwave radiation. These satellites are considered a promising, non-polluting energy source for the future, but could also be used to heat the sea and air around hurricanes, altering their paths and dissipating their energy.</p>",
  "A girl of 14 died on the operating table early yesterday after being hit by shots from a passing car yards from her home. <p>The mother of Danielle Beccan heard gunfire and ran from the house to find her daughter slumped on the ground. </p> <p>Danielle was returning from the annual Goose Fair in Nottingham with a group of friends just after midnight when she was hit by up to six bullets. </p> <p>It was not clear last night whether the shooting had been random or whether the gunmen had been targeting others in the group. Nottingham has been plagued by a spate of gun crime in recent years. </p> <p>A teenage friend of the victim told The Observer: 'One of her friends saw a gun pointing out and shouted for everyone to get down, but she was too slow. She was dropping to the floor when she was hit in the chest and stomach.' </p> <p>A 17-year-old, who did not want to be named, said she was in a nearby street when she heard the gunfire and ran to see what had happened. </p> <p>'I saw the car, a gold Citro\u00ebn with blacked-out windows,' she said. 'I reckoned it was a case of mistaken identity because they were with a group of boys.' </p> <p>Nottinghamshire's assistant chief constable, Sue Fish, said: 'This is a truly wicked and callous crime. We will do everything in our power to find the people responsible.' </p> <p>Although Danielle was not in any kind of gang, tensions between rival groups of youths traditionally run high at this time of year. </p> <p>Superintendent David Colbeck, in charge of policing the area, appealed for anyone with information to come forward. 'She's 14. She's just a child,' he said. 'She's just going home with her friends from a good night out at Goose Fair. </p> <p>'She's not part of a gang who's been shot and killed. She's innocent, for God's sake. It could have been your daughter, your son. These people are evil and they need to go to prison.'</p>",
  "<p>When he retired at 55, banker Chris Shergold was looking forward to some well-earned relaxation on his allotment and a few globetrotting holidays across Africa with his wife. </p> <p>There has been little time, however, for cultivating vegetables. As share prices fell and his retirement portfolio dwindled, Shergold reluctantly decided to go back to work. Now 61, he calculates he must stay another six years in his new job as a financial services manager for the charity Age Concern to live in comfort later. </p> <p>'When I retired, the stock market was on the way up: the returns we expected from endowment policies looked as if we were going to be a lot more comfortable,' he said. Now I don't see myself stopping before 65, and I suspect I will go on after that.' </p> <p>Scared? Adair Turner thinks you should be. The former CBI chairman, appointed by Tony Blair to examine the looming crisis in British pensions, will on Tuesday finally outline the stark choices facing the 'baby boomer' generation of forty- and fifty-somethings born in the postwar population surge between 1946 and 1964. </p> <p>Unless they fancy an old age of penury, he will warn, they must either cut back on spending and save more, work longer or, if they want higher state pensions, be prepared to pay more tax. The good times are over. </p> <p>It is not a popular message. David Willetts, the Tories' work and pensions spokesman who gave extensive evidence to Turner, talks of a 'gigantic game of bluff' between rebellious Boomers refusing to compromise on their lifestyles and a government insisting that it cannot afford to bail them out. </p> <p>But it is a stand-off with massive consequences. There are 17 million Boomers who, over the next decade, will begin drawing pensions, placing an unprecedented strain on the Treasury's coffers. </p> <p>And a declining birthrate means that as they retire, there will be fewer young adults paying taxes to fund those pensions: by 2036, the number of 60- to 74-year-olds is forecast to have grown by up to half. </p> <p>Such demographic changes have combined in a triple whammy with a volatile stock market affecting Boomers' investments, and - alarmingly for those who put their cash into bricks and mortar - a slowing property market. </p> <p>Willetts points out that as retiring Boomers rush en masse to sell off their family homes and cash in on profits made during the house price boom, they could swamp the market: cashing in their share portfolios could similarly affect the stock market. 'As the Boomers retire, if they all start running down their savings then we might see asset prices falling,' he warns. </p> <p>Nor are Boomers the only demographic challenge to the system. Babies raised on the wartime 'austerity diet' - with its strict rationing of fatty foods and use of homegrown vegetables - have recently been recognised as healthier than today's junk food-addicted offspring, but their impact on British life expectancy is only now emerging. A recent paper by leading actuary Richard Willets identified a 'super-cohort' born in the 1930s and 1940s, who are unexpectedly surviving longer than the generations before or after them. Will company pension funds stand the strain? </p> <p>No wonder, then, that when central bankers from across Europe and the US gathered for their annual summer retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming - along with Turner, who was a speaker - the topic was the impact on western governments of demographic change. Or put simply: what will become of the Beatles' generation when they really are 64? </p> <p>When Dianne Frances moved from Hull to Bristol to be nearer to her two grandchildren, she knew she was making a choice. 'If you want me to save, I'd have to stop living now,' she said. 'If I'd thought about my pension before my life, I would never have moved, but my grandchildren are important to me.'</p> <p>At 55, the neighbourhood renewal co-ordinator is resigned to minimal income in her retirement anyway: like many women her age, she stopped work when she had children and when she returned, after a divorce and lengthy retraining, never earned enough to put much aside. 'I was part-time, still bringing up the children on my own, paying the mortgage - and you'll pay for your child to go on a school trip rather than pay into a pension.' </p> <p>Stories like hers have inspired an entire chapter in Turner's report on the pension threat facing women. And if women like her are to work for longer in order to save more for retirement, the challenge will be to persuade employers to hire them. Frances, who hopes to work until she is at least 65, already fears that ageism will affect her ability to get a job. 'You get this thing about \"maybe I had better cut my hair and put on more makeup so people will think I am younger than I am\".' </p> <p>Age discrimination at work, due to be outlawed in Britain by 2006, is just one of a number of issues being driven up the political agenda by the power of the so-called 'grey vote'. It is no coincidence that both Michael Howard and Tony Blair promised 'dignity and security' in old age in their recent party conference speeches. </p> <p>Howard is targeting voters like Shergold, who says he is angry about both tax rates and the Treasury's raids on pension funds. 'It feels like if you save too much someone comes along and says: \"we are going to take that away from you\",' he said. </p> <p>Blair, meanwhile, promised a system with 'the basic state pension at its core', and 'incentives to save' for all - a signal that the current regime of a state pension topped up with means-tested credits for the poorest, favoured by the Treasury as an efficient way of targeting the neediest, may no longer be politically sustainable. </p> <p>With Turner's appointment widely seen as a move by Downing Street to wrest control of the pensions issue back from the Treasury, battle is brewing. And tomorrow, it will take another twist. </p> <p>The fiftysomething man attending the Rhondda MP Chris Bryant's advice surgery was furious. Signed off sick and put on incapacity benefits after a heart attack in 1986, he was indignant that a recent review of his case had judged him fit to work.</p> <p>'He said to me: \"The worst thing about it is that your benefits are so low that I have to mix cement on a building site every day to make ends meet\",' recalls Bryant. The complaint was made without irony: the man could not accept that if he was well enough to moonlight he was well enough to work.</p> <p>In Bryant's Welsh valleys constituency, around a third of men of working age claim incapacity benefit, a legacy of the recession years when many long-term unemployed were shepherded on to sickness benefits, conveniently removing them from the jobless tolls, only to become trapped there.</p> <p>All that, Blair will argue tomorrow, is going to change - with the money saved by shaking up incapacity benefit used to fund the pension reforms he has hinted at. Even his hosts for tomorrow's speech, the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, are unconvinced: they want the state pension age put up to 67 instead, raising enough money for more generous state pensions without benefit cuts.</p> <p>The battle now, however, is to persuade tomorrow's pensioners that they will have to work longer to pay for their lengthening period of old age.</p> <p>Starting tomorrow, Blair must somehow convince millions that their pensions are safe in his hands - or face an unexpectedly early retirement himself.</p> <p><strong>What to do about your pension</strong></p> <p><strong> In your 20s</strong> </p> <p>The earlier you start, the less hard it is on your pocket. A 20- year-old would need to save only \u00a352 a month to achieve a pension fund of \u00a3100,000 on retirement at 60. </p> <p><strong> In your 30s</strong> </p> <p>Although money may be tight, you should aim to save about 10 to 15 per cent of your salary in a pension scheme to take advantage of the tax benefits. </p> <p><strong> In your 40s</strong> </p> <p>No excuses. You must get serious about saving for your retirement now. Up to 20 per cent of your salary should be put away. </p> <p><strong> In your 50s</strong> </p> <p>You should consider gradually switching part of your pension fund from shares into steadier investments such as government bonds and cash. </p> <p><strong> In your 60s</strong> </p> <p>You need to decide how to convert your fund into income. You can take up to 25 per cent as tax-free cash or use the lot to buy an annuity, which pays out on a monthly or annual basis for your lifetime. Those with funds of \u00a3100,000 or more could opt for 'income drawdown', in which you leave your fund invested in stocks and shares and take a certain amount out each month.</p>",
  "<p>Washington will this week urge the international community to offer fresh financial and moral backing for the reconstruction of Iraq, as the United States is forced to spend extra cash on shoring up security. </p> <p>President George Bush's Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, will fly to Tokyo to call on delegates to an international 'Iraq reconstruction conference' to put their hands in their pockets. </p> <p>With recriminations about the invasion of Iraq moving rapidly up the agenda in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, Bush is eager to convince US voters they will not have to foot the entire bill for rebuilding the shattered country. Congress has set aside more than $18bn (\u00a310bn) for reconstruction, but has admitted it is having to divert more of its budget than it anticipated to security and law enforcement.</p> <p>At a global donors' conference in Madrid a year ago, more than 30 countries pledged a total of $13bn for reconstruction projects, but much of the cash has failed to materialise. Revenues from restoring oil exports have also been slower to materi alise than the US hoped.</p> <p>But aid charities say lack of funds isn't their main concern. 'You just can't push too much money in that quickly,' says Oliver Burch, Iraq programme manager at Christian Aid. 'The state isn't functioning well yet.

  "Everytime I leave my home in Baghdad, I expect either to be killed or kidnapped. But life has to go on. You have to deal with it. <p>Everybody in Iraq now faces kidnap, killing and robbery every day, and no one knows what is going to happen in five minutes. </p> <p>But what I hope - what everybody hopes - is that our future will be better than the present and the past. </p> <p>I want Iraq to enjoy peace, stability and prosperity, which we have been deprived of for years. But what we need is action, not words. </p> <p>I feel the kind of kidnappings and murders of hostages that we have seen - like Kenneth Bigley - is un-Islamic. People should understand that. </p> <p>I have been close to death three times since the regime fell. When the Minister of Education was attacked I was in the car just behind him. Another time, going to work, there was an explosion just a few metres from where I was. The third time there was an attack on my radio station by a mortar - which, fortunately, did not explode. </p> <p>Like every other Iraqi, I believe that the issue of weapons of mass destruction was an excuse to wage a war on Iraq. The purpose of the war was to control Iraq. </p> <p>Reactions vary from one to another among the Iraqi people. Some welcome the presence of the multinational forces because, thanks to them, they can now speak freely. But others blame the Americans and their soldiers for the loss of security and stability in Iraq. </p> <p>It was good that they removed Saddam, but what happened after Saddam is bad - because now we are paying a heavy price for freedom. </p> <p>In many respects, all our lives have been a big lie. We lost our trust in leaders, although the interim Prime Minister, Ayad Allawi, is doing a good job in tough circumstances. </p> <p>When people phone me on the radio show, it is to complain about what is happening. People want the foreigners behind the terrorist operations to leave Iraq. But it is also the Iraqis' responsibility to ask the occupying forces to leave, because American operations are hurting the Iraqis too. </p> <p>I suspect that the terrorist are deliberately targetting women and children. Just before I came to London, there was an explosion in an area where children had gathered to get free sweets during a religious celebration. The terrorists knew the children would be there, and they came by car and turned it into catastrophe. </p> <p>If I could speak to Tony Blair, I would tell him that Iraqis are known for being patient. But they have had enough. We want our future - not just for us, but for our children. </p> <p>I think the biggest problem that we have faced is that there was no proper planning after the war, especially when they dismantled the ministries of defence, security and information. What makes me especially pessimistic is the increase in terrorist attacks. But I am still an optimist, otherwise I could not go on. </p> <p>And for some people - officials in work and people like me - salaries have gone up and we do live a better life now. </p> <p>That is especially true for women. Before, women were deprived of a lot of things and they were oppressed. It is a mixed picture, but some things have got better for women while some have got worse. </p> <p>Before the fall of Saddam, I - like many other women - was busy worrying about my children, running the house, and always concerned about the rations we would get. Would I be able to put food on the table? </p> <p>Women were just there to provide food for their children - and they were pushed away from any role in cultural life, from any role in education and from any role in work. But at least in that area, for some women, life is improving. </p> <p>But there are still problems. Unemployment among women has increased - partly because many women worked in the ministries that were abolished, including the Ministry of Information. </p> <p>I am one of the luckier ones, and I believe that Allah will protect me. It's also fortunate that I'm well known and popular with the people in Iraq, so I do feel safer.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Leading Iraqi broadcaster Amal al-Mudarris was speaking to Peter Beaumont.

  "Ken Bigley, the British engineer murdered by militants in Iraq, made a last desperate bid for freedom, escaping his captors before being hunted down and killed, it was claimed yesterday. <p>News agencies based in Baghdad said insurgents had told them that Bigley, 62, had evaded 10 guards, possibly with the assistance of a member of the group that had been holding him for three weeks, and had been able to flee into the town of Latifya, 20 miles south of Baghdad. </p> <p>According to the Associated Press, which quoted a masked gunman claiming to be close to the kidnappers, Bigley managed to hide from his captors for 12 hours. The kidnappers then mounted a house-to-house search, finding their hostage the next morning in a deserted area, carrying a gun, the militant said. It was not immediately clear how Bigley might have obtained a weapon. Bigley was killed soon after being recaptured, the gunman was reported to have said. </p> <p>Reuters quoted insurgent sources saying that Bigley had escaped, but had been free for only half an hour. 'He didn't even make the main road [in Latifya],' the source said. There was no independent confirmation of the reports last night, but American officials have said they, too, have received 'credible' reports that Bigley tried to escape. Iraqi government officials have said they had received information that supported the claim. 'We have heard that witnesses saw the escape, but details are still uncertain,' said one. </p> <p>British officials in Baghdad and London would not comment. </p> <p>Bigley, who was working on an American base, was the first British hostage killed in Iraq, but the 28th overall to die. The Liverpool-born contractor was taken from his Baghdad home on 16 September, along with Americans Eugene Armstrong, 52, and Jack Hensley, 48. The Americans were beheaded within days. </p> <p>Footage sent to Abu Dhabi TV last week showed Bigley reading a statement while kneeling in front of six masked gunmen. One militant, speaking in Arabic, then declared the Briton would be killed because his government refused to release women prisoners detained in Iraq. </p> <p>He then severed Bigley's head with a knife, as three others pinned him down. The tape ended with the killer holding up the severed head. Abu Dhabi TV did not broadcast the footage, saying it refused 'to serve as a mouthpiece for such groups or their actions'. </p> <p>Officials in Baghdad dismissed reports of a rescue attempt that may have provoked the murder, saying that they had never even established where Bigley was being held.</p> <p>Sombat, Bigley's Thai wife, appealed yesterday for privacy to mourn her husband. 'No words can express the agony I feel for the loss of my husband, Ken. He was a good man and a loving, caring husband,' she said in a short statement issued through the British embassy in Bangkok. </p> <p>'He went to help the Iraqi people. I would like to say my deepest thanks to those of you who have prayed for Ken and our family, from all religious backgrounds,' she said. </p> <p>The murder has provoked condemnation throughout the Islamic world and from British Muslim groups. 'This act can only be described as a heinous crime, and has no relation to Islam or any humane trait,' said Anas al-Tikriti, of the Muslim Association of Britain. </p> <p>The Islamic Society of Britain called the killing 'inhuman' and said that it could not be 'be excused in the name of Islam or any other decent way of life'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, has appealed for British workers to carry on the rebuilding of Iraq, saying the 'work has to be done' to ensure peace. </p> <p>Hain admitted that Britons still working in Iraq now faced a 'terrible dilemma', but said that, without their efforts, a peaceful and stable Iraq 'cannot possibly be achieved'. </p> <p>Bigley's death is now almost certain to lead to a wide-ranging government statement on Iraq when the Commons returns tomorrow, giving MPs their first chance to question ministers not only about the hostage-taking but crucially about the report of the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) last week, which concluded that Saddam had no WMD when the coalition invaded. </p> <p>Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy are both demanding an early statement, with Kennedy keen to cross-examine the Prime Minister not only over the ISG's findings, but also over the recent leak of secret documents covering negotiations with Washington in the run-up to the war.</p>",
  "Baghdad's most notorious prisoner, Saddam Hussein, does not have much to do most days. His one court appearance in 10 months has come and gone. The International Committee for the Red Cross visits him occasionally to ensure that he is not being badly treated. <p>The monotony of imprisonment is sometimes broken by the visits of his interrogator and the US military doctors who monitor his health. </p> <p>Within the rings of US armour, helicopters and troops, the sense of isolation is punctuated only by the noise of the aircraft that corkscrew down towards the airport's nearby runway to avoid insurgent fire. They are a reminder of how his horizons have shrunk to four walls. </p> <p>Once Saddam led one of the most powerful and wealthy states in the region. Now he writes and reads romantic novels. During his exercise period he is allowed to tend a tree inside a walled courtyard inside the facility known as Camp Cropper, inside Baghdad's sprawling airport complex, under constant suicide watch by a hand-picked team of US military jailers. </p> <p>When the 'debriefer' comes to see Saddam it is to continue the lengthy process that began with his capture in December from his spider hole north of Baghdad. </p> <p>Last week, for the first time, the details of those conversations, and those with other prominent detainees, were revealed in the final report of the Iraq Survey Group, set up to search for evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>In concluding what has been self-evident for months - that Iraq retained no WMD - the ISG has also painted a compelling psychological picture of Saddam in the last few weeks and months before his regime was crushed. </p> <p>It is a picture that, while not absolving the intelligence services of the US and UK and their political masters of a colossal and wide-reaching failure of intelligence over Iraq's WMD, at least offers a partial explanation: that even in Iraq, few really knew the complex truth of Saddam and his weapons. </p> <p>That explanation is rooted in the psyche of Saddam himself, and of the nature of his inner circle. Of how Saddam led by inference and suggestion, and encouraged the existence of conflicting realities to control his underlings and secure his rule. </p> <p>There is one passage in the ISG's report, published last Wednesday, that is as much allegorical as factual in explaining the character of Saddam. And it was supplied by Saddam Hussein himself. </p> <p>The former Iraqi dictator is a man with many identifications - most of them from Arab and Iraqi history. He has portrayed himself as a new Nebuchadnezzar or Saladin. </p> <p>More extraordinary, as it emerged last week, was his identification with the figure of the old fisherman, Santiago, in Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, who fights a useless battle to save a marlin he has caught from the sharks that tear his catch to shreds. </p> <p>'Saddam tended to characterise, in a very Hemingway-esque way, his life as a relentless struggle against overwhelming odds, but carried out with courage, perseverance and dignity,' the report concluded. </p> <p>'Much like Santiago, ultimately left with only the marlin's skeleton as the trophy of his success, to Saddam even a hollow victory was by his reckoning a real one.' </p> <p>It is a narcissism, believes the report's author, the former UN inspector and head of the ISG, Charles Duelfer, that summed up the regime of Saddam in his last days on the brink of annihilation, blinded to the realities that confronted it and drunk on dreams of the kind of glory only achieved amid defeat. </p> <p>It is a narcissism too that was combined with the recklessness of the self-obsessed and the self-deluded. </p> <p>It is demonstrated by an exchange between Saddam and his generals recounted to the LA Times by a senior US intelligence officer on the brink of last year's war - a story that goes to the heart of Saddam's final deception: that of his own generals. </p> <p>Shortly before the war last year, Saddam gathered his top generals together to share what came to them as astonishing news: the weapons that the US was launching a war to remove did not exist. </p> <p>'There was plenty of surprise when Saddam said, \"Sorry guys, we don't have any\" to use against the invading forces,' the official said. </p> <p>It should not have come as a surprise. As the ISG report makes abundantly clear, not only had military units not had chemical or biological weapons training, no stockpiles had been deployed or identified for use, for the simple reason that they did not exist. </p> <p>If that exchange was a mark of how closed - even to his generals - Saddam's intentions were, now the former dictator has been coaxed over the months into a kind of confessional intimacy. </p> <p>The incentive during those long debriefings has been Saddam's opportunity to describe himself in the terms in which he is most obsessed - his place in history. </p> <p>It is a picture that has not only been supplied by Saddam himself. In addition other senior regime officials in their own debriefings - many perhaps to exonerate their own actions - have also been speaking of the grand illusion that was at the heart of Saddam's regime. </p> <p>But it leaves a critical question to be answered. If Saddam knew that he had no stockpiles of weapons, why did he allow his regime to give the impression for so long that he was defying the world? </p> <p>The reality, according to Duelfer, was that despite the intelligence assessment in the aftermath of the invasion that Saddam had not been told by his generals that he had no WMD, it was Saddam himself who had known since the late 1990s that he had no weapons. </p> <p>Before that it was Saddam who had micromanaged the weapons programmes; Saddam who had obsessed about their value. And it was Saddam who, while insisting his country had disarmed to the international community, continued to suggest to his own people that he retained a WMD capability. </p> <p>According to his former minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Humam Abd al-Khaliq Abd al-Ghafur, it was precisely Saddam's ego, and successive errors of judgment, that encouraged him to avoid admitting what had been a fact of years - he had long ago unwillingly complied with the armistice agreements to disarm that had ended the first Gulf war, despite hankering for new weapons if he could get the international community off his back. It maintained a deception that would be lethal to Saddam's violent regime. </p> <p>In that respect, according to presidential adviser and Saddam's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid, it fitted in with one of Saddam's own favourite military precepts that the 'better part of war was deceiving'. To avoid appearing weak, Saddam gave out confusing messages about the fact he had disarmed. </p> <p>But in the end it was only one of a series of fatal miscalculations that Saddam made in the run-up to the US invasion, the most serious of which, as his deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz would explain, was his assessment of US intentions and failure to grasp how America had changed in the aftermath of 11 September. </p> <p>That miscalculation was described by Aziz in his own interrogation, when challenged over why Saddam and the regime had seemed so 'confident' in the immediate run-up to the invasion. </p> <p>'I had to say these things because this was my government's position, but it was true,' Aziz told his interrogator. 'A few weeks before the attacks Saddam thought that the US would not use ground forces; he thought that you would only use your air force. </p> <p>'He thought the [US] would not fight a ground war because it would be too costly to the Americans. He was overconfident. He was clever, but his calculations were poor. It wasn't that he wasn't receiving the information. It was right there on television, but he didn't understand international relations.' </p> <p>The former Minister of Defence, Sultan Hashim Ahmad al-Tai, presents a different interpretation but with the same description of Saddam's inherent misjudgment. </p> <p>'We knew the goal was to make the regime fall... We thought the forces would arrive in Baghdad or outside Baghdad in 20 days or a month. We accepted that the cities on the way would be lost. All commanders knew this and accepted it. Saddam Hussein thought that the people would, of their own accord, take to the streets and fight with light arms, and that this would deter the US forces from entering the cities.' </p> <p>Saddam's own account - as described in his debriefing sessions - was that he had wanted to develop better relations with the US over the latter part of the 1990s although this was constantly rebuffed. </p> <p>By late 2002 as it became increasingly clear that the US would invade, Saddam, says Duelfer, had persuaded himself, just as he did in before the first Gulf war, that the US would not attack because it already had achieved its objectives of establishing a military presence in the region. </p> <p>Instead, as US troops gathered on his border, Saddam speculated that the US would seek to avoid casualties and, if Iraq was attacked at all, the campaign would resemble Desert Fox. </p> <p>As Duelfer's report makes clear, it was not only the issue of information on WMD - or the lack of them - that was micromanaged by Saddam. </p> <p>Saddam also personally managed a second key strand of Iraqi policy - the alleged corruption of the oil-for-food programme - by paying huge bribes to those willing to help Iraq, skimmed off the top of the programme. </p> <p>It was a complex system that ensured that any money paid did not come out of the Iraqi exchequer, but through a complex voucher system, each one personally authorised by Saddam. The vouchers, meticulously recorded by the Ministry of Oil, authorised the named recipient to receive part of an oil shipment, usually handled by traders in the Gulf who would make a payment to a named account. </p> <p>It is a corruption, say some, that embroiled even senior UN officials involved in running the scheme, a claim that is still under investigation. </p> <p>But like Saddam's WMD, what has yet to be proved is how real the corruption was. Some Iraqis have suggested that in reality the scheme may in some if not many cases have ended up doing no more than enrich officials at the Ministry of Oil, who pocketed the oil revenues themselves. What is certain is that no one on the list of alleged recipients has admitted receiving Iraqi money. </p> <p>But even that scheme may have been massively misconceived, persuading Saddam wrongly that he had bought more influence in the international community with his stolen millions than was the case. </p> <p>But if Saddam was attempting, largely unsuccessfully, to buy influence - particularly in Russia and France, which in the end could do little to prevent a US-led attack - the main focus of his thinking in his last couple of years in power, as Duelfer described it last week, was how to secure the survival of his dynasty inside Iraq. </p> <p>And it is this, some of his top officials have told their debriefers, that they believe was most responsible for the creeping unreality at the heart of the Saddam's regime. </p> <p>By 2001, say senior officials, Saddam had promoted family members to many of the most sensitive jobs in the regime and was in the process of anointing his son Qusay as his heir apparent. </p> <p>By the time of the UN inspections crisis that immediately pre-dated the invasion the influence of family and clan members on the 'group-think' at the heart of the regime was such that in his interrogation Vice-President Taha Yassin Ramadan would venture: 'The last three years with Saddam bothered me the most. There were too many relatives in sensitive jobs. When I was put in charge of [dealing with UN weapons] inspections, I was qualified to do the job. My staff will tell you I could have fixed it.' </p> <p>He added: 'Saddam was weak with his family members. He punished them, but let them go right back to doing what they were doing in the first place.' Ali Hassan al-Majid added that the only occasions he saw Saddam yield under 'pressure' was in dealing with relatives. 'He used to stand by their side regardless of any reason.' </p> <p>And it was Qusay whose influence on Saddam's hazy grasp on what confronted him seems to have been the most pernicious influence in Saddam's last days in power. </p> <p>According to Duelfer, for many senior Iraqis Qusay's significance stemmed directly from his influence upon his father. 'These former senior officials,' wrote Duelfer last week, 'dismiss Qusay's intelligence and leadership ability. </p> <p>'The former MIC director, Abd al-Tawab Abdullah Mullah al-Huwaysh, recounted that on one occasion in late 2002 when he met with Saddam and Qusay, Qusay boasted to his father, \"We are 10 times more powerful than in 1991\". </p> <p>'Immediately disagreeing, Huwaysh said, \"Actually, we are 100 times weaker than in 1991, because the people are not ready to fight.\" Saddam did not respond, but Qusay was angry that Huwaysh had contradicted him.' </p> <p>It was not only Huwaysh who appears to have complained about Qusay's influence in the last months. </p> <p>Other officials have told their US debriefers that Qusay was profoundly suspicious of recommendations from within the army and often disregarded them. </p> <p>It was a disdain that continued until the very eve of war. The former commander of the Nebuchadnezzar Republican Guard Division, Staff Major General Hamid Ismail Dawish al-Rabai, disclosed: 'We thought the coalition would go to Basra, maybe to Amarra, and then the war would end </p> <p>'Qusay never took any information seriously. He would just mark on the map. He thought most of us were clowns. We pretended to have victory, and we never provided true information as it is here on planet earth. Qusay always thought he'd gain victory. Any commander who spoke the truth would lose his head.' </p> <p>This time there was no imagined hollow victory to try to sell to the exhausted Iraqi people. Only utter defeat.</p>",
  "<p>John Kerry and George Bush may have been slugging it out with great gusto on Friday night but according to Steven Andrew, chief economist with Isis Asset Management, this is a 'good election to lose'. Whoever emerges as the victor on 2 November - and, Friday night's performances notwithstanding, it is still too close to call - they will have the same issues to deal with; a budget deficit expected to top $445 billion this year, companies that are fearful that this is as good as profits are going to get; and consumers who, courtesy of mass remortgaging and Bush's tax bribes, have been encouraged to spend tomorrow's income today. </p> <p>Kerry has made a reduction in the budget deficit a central plank in his campaign, pledging to reverse Bush's tax cuts for those earning more than $200,000 a year. That should be possible but, with most observers expecting Congress to stay in Republican hands, he is likely to struggle to get any other big tax changes through. And, if investors sense that he is struggling to control the deficit, the bond market could start to get the jitters, and the overseas investors who have kept the dollar from falling even more than it has could also get a bit more nervous. </p> <p>Bush faces the same problem - and he is not only committed to making the tax cuts permanent, he would find it hard to make cuts in obvious areas such as defence and military spending given that his entire re-election campaign hinges on his conviction that he was right to go to war against Iraq. </p> <p>Of course, it is still possible that the US economy will spring back to life. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, at least, believes this is just a 'soft patch' and that demand will recover - although he also promises to keep interest rates as low as needed, for as long as needed, to ensure the recovery is not derailed. We will get some clues about the outlook from the third quarter reporting season, which kicks off in earnest this week, but if the recent trading statements from companies such as Intel and Cisco, Colgate and Coca-Cola are anything to go by, the news is unlikely to be uplifting. Factor in a stubbornly high oil price and that consumers no longer have tax cuts or re-mortgaging windfalls to spend, and it is hard to see where the impetus will come from. </p> <p>The stock market came to that conclusion some months ago; while the FTSE 100 is at its highest for 27 months, the Dow is 200 points below where it was six months ago. That, combined with the profit increases being posted at the start of the year, means that the valuation of the US market now looks a bit less extravagant than it did. </p> <p>But, as John Hatherly, head of global analysis at M&amp;G points out, at between 16 and 17 times expected earnings for the current year, it still looks expensive compared with the 12 or 13 times earnings for the British and European stock markets - particularly when there is uncertainty over whether the analysts' forecasts on which those earnings estimates are based will have to be downgraded further as the third-quarter results and outlook statements are issued. </p> <p>Mike Lenhoff, global strategist at Brewin Dolphin, thinks the pessimism is underdone. While the 4 to 5 per cent economic growth enjoyed earlier in the year is clearly unsustainable, the 3 to 4 per cent which he is expecting is still healthy enough. But above all, stock markets hate uncertainty and investors in the US have got more jittery since Kerry's campaign was kick-started by his good showing in the first election debate. That is likely to continue until the result of the election is clear. </p> <p>On the face of it, there is then scope from some rebalancing of portfolios depending on who wins: Kerry's promise to cut healthcare costs could be bad for an already beleaguered pharmaceutical sector; the defence sector could be favoured under a Bush win. But that is tinkering at the margins. The bigger question is what happens to the economy - and November's result will make little difference to that.</p>",
  "<p>There was a fleeting moment, a few months ago, when David Barclay said - or seemed to say - that his Telegraph might no longer support the Tories, that open-mindedness might be the order of his new day. Well, you can forget that.</p> <p>'Michael Howard played a blinder by the sea,' gushed a Telegraph leader as the Calm Man took a bow. 'The electorate is in a conservative mood again... Conservatism is coming back into vogue and now it is up to the Conservatives to harry Labour from office.'</p> <p>As triumphs of hope over Hartlepool experience (or opinion polls showing that only 12 per cent of voters believe Howard will ever be PM) go, that was pretty ripe. But at least the Barclaygraph will stick to its Blackagraph course (and pension-drawing readership profile): old Tories still stump up 60p for it every morning. Neither they nor the Barclays have anywhere else to go. </p> <p>Thus the suddenly more significant questions after an overdose of Bournemouth and Brighton ozone passed Telegraph Towers by - but knocked on almost every other Fleet Street door. Who are we backing next May? And who do we love most, Tony or Gordon? </p> <p>Some of the answers aren't too difficult to guess. The Express, which used to love Blair and eat biscuits at his tea table, has turned into an attack dog biscuit (perhaps because its readers are just as old and just as Tory as the Telegraph). It will carry on a hyena howl of hate far beyond next spring, banging on about immigration and never stopping to wonder why the Daily Star (which majors in boobs not political bile) keeps gaining circulation.</p> <p>Equally, the Mirror - after its latest editor's rather perfunctory affirmation of regained faith in Labour - must now sit tight and deal with its own Paul Routledge's admiration for Brown once the polls closed. The Mail? It 'can never regain' whatever trust it once reposed in the Prime Minister, but it worries whether 'boring but competent' policies are enough to turf him out. Much yack about 'shadows' of doubt, distrust and disillusion; many hand-wringing editorials. But the Mail doesn't like backing losers. Its 'clear and consistent' policy will probably consist of playing Samson on the temple steps.</p> <p>No, the big ones in this equation are owned by Rupert Murdoch. And the interesting ones on Gordon and Tony and Charlie are the Guardian and Independent. Will the Sun win it for the Tories? No way. They're 'sick and tired', according to Dr Trevor Kavanagh. Even when Howard puts on a decent show - 'like a lawyer setting out facts to a client', according to Kavanagh QC - 'the polls are against him and his party being elected'. It's a 'weak team'. </p> <p>This is the Murdoch equivalent of don't-call-me-I'll-call-you. And if you want more grey reasons, turn from the Bun to the tartlet Times, as it grinds on about 'lightweight Shadow Cabinet' members, MPs with 'odd views' and 'high Tories who have a contempt for contemporary America'. What, heresy? Rupe doesn't beat about the Bush these days. You're either for me or down the pan, Mikey.</p> <p>News International, in short, is along for the full Blair ride (with psychiatrist Kavanagh explaining to Gordon how he's misunderstood Tony). That won't change until Labour look like losers, friends of Murdoch no longer worth cultivating. Don't hold your breath. </p> <p>And over there, at the end of the liberal rainbow? The Independent, still fuming over Iraq, is definitely in play, yet coy about too much commitment (at least until Sir Anthony O'Reilly has finished wooing advertising agencies).</p> <p>But the Guardian almost seems to be making up its mind in public. It backed the Lib Dems in Hartlepool as some kind of virility test. Several of its most influential commentators are bailing out on Blairism, firing weapons of mass disillusionment. You can see a Brown surge building. But what if, as so often before, Gordon goes quiet and team-playing again for the parliamentary duration? How do you back a non-candidate? These, for the moment, are the politics of Hobson's choice. Good chap, Hobson. Why isn't he standing?</p> <p><strong>A ripe porky pie and a big cheese that's gone off</strong></p> <p>It was, by any standards, a rattling good political yarn. A cabinet minister, discovered in the canteen eating mutton pie and beans when he should have been answering questions in the House, got the boot. (He said he was detained on 'important business', which is an unusual kind of mutton and porky pie). </p> <p>Another big cheese of a health minister, having made a rare hash of hospital closures, slipped several notches down the greasy poll. Finance supremos came and went. A beleaguered leader talked desperately about 'the right team for the right time'.</p> <p>Humph! said the Daily Telegraph. This isn't a government of all the talents, this a government of nil talent in which politicians 'no one has heard of get reshuffled to galvanise an administration no one likes'. At least, that was what my early edition of the Telegraph said - across a dedicated page of detailed and juicy coverage. Ripe stuff, even on Michael Howard's big day. Action, no words. Accountability plus mutability.</p> <p>But then something went bump in the night. By the Telegraph's London edition dropped on my mat there wasn't a word about this Scottish cabinet upheaval in Edinburgh. Nor could I find a mention of it in the Independent, Guardian or Times. Just 309 words in the FT was the sum total of metropolitan interest - another glum helping of devolution pie and has-beens.</p> <p>The devolved idea, you may remember, was to make Scotland more democratic, more powerful, more interesting, as it spent its own (and England's) money.</p> <p>National papers poured in extra reporters and pages. But then - equally predictably - the bottom fell out of this particular bucket. Scotland, it appeared, was only interesting to Scots. When in doubt, take it out after first edition. North of the border had become somehow foreign and irrelevant, a faraway land of which we wished to know little. Islington yawned and moved on.</p> <p>So they spend our money, dominate our Parliament, nominate Big Gordo to rule Downing Street - and we wipe any mention of them from the face of our earth. Maybe if they'd banned google-wearing kids in kilts from playing conkers we'd have kept them until the Islington slip. McDumb, McDumber, McDumbest.</p> <p><strong>Why should Wally carry the can?</strong></p> <p>Wally Cowley, circulation chief at Mirror Group Newspapers, was one of the most amiable titans of the news trade, a loyal toiler through 16 tough years. Until last week, that is, when Cowley got canned. Thank you (said his recently upgraded boss, Ellis Watson) and goodnight. </p> <p>On the face of it, perhaps, you can see why. Take last July's figures, the month Watson got his feet under his new desk, and compare them with July 1988, the year of Wally's first coming. Then, the Mirror sold 3,157,269 copies a day. Now it's 1,816,908. Then, the Sunday Mirror sold 2,965,863; make that 1,569,781 now. Then, the People stood at 2,552,092; today the sum total of People people is 1,022,243.</p> <p>No wonder Cowley's out, you may think; the only real surprise is that he didn't go earlier. But that is both unfair and a huge misunderstanding. Circulation directors don't increase or decrease circulation much. Their job is getting the copies spread around and the offers organised. It's editors, and senior managers like Watson and Sly Bailey, who are paid to carry the ultimate can. Alas, poor Wal... I hope his tin came stuffed with pennies.</p> <p><strong>Ban on Bambi?</strong></p> <p>The BBC and Ofcom are at loggerheads again over an Ofcom code which, the Beeb says, could breach the UN Charter on the Rights of the Child and stop it showing Bambi (though the causal link there remains a tad obscure). But not only that... Ofcom wants to make sure 'that factual programmes must respect the truth'. Call it Gilligan's Law and ask the inevitable question: Will these power-crazed bureaucrats stop at nothing?</p>"
