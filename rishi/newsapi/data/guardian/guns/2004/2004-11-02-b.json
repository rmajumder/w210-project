  "The rain-sheets quickly cleared eastwards as the morning advanced and by the time we hauled up beside the wind-bent plantation that flanks Burbage Edge the sun was glinting on Buxton's drying rooftops and the white plume shone out as it crossed the sky from Tunstead Quarry's new chimney. The grasses of Goyt Dale's Wild Moor were burnished, too; contrasting with a background of dark conifers on Hoo Moor. <p>Beyond White Hall we climbed to the foot of the gritstone crags that encircle most of Combs Moss, that great brown, peat-topped plateau that separates Goyt Dale and the western edge of the limestone country. The overnight deluge hadn't improved the going on this moor-edge but the splash-and-skid was made more tolerable by the super prospects away to the north- west. The Shining Tor/Cats Tor ridge drops away to allow a glimpse of Greater Manchester before the sharp profile of Sponds Hill intervenes above Lyme Park. Far away to the north, hazy Hollingworth Hall Moor seemed a hundred miles distant today; Winter Hill couldn't be distinguished from its faint wrap-around of cloud beyond Oldham. </p> <p>Ahead rose the bold prow of Combs Edge culminating in Castle Naze. This latter supports Peakland's finest sited prehistoric fortress and the rocks below it were the hunting ground of the well remembered Siegfried Herford in the years before the Great War. </p> <p>Later, from Black Edge, we looked down to the limestone plateau, shattered and pock-marked by sporadic quarrying through the centuries - little wonder that it's excluded from the National Park.</p>",
  "Iraqi insurgents yesterday kidnapped an American and up to five others in an audacious attack on a house in western Baghdad. <p>An interior ministry source told the Guardian the militants approached the villa in the Mansour district in three cars, and that the hostages were taken after a 20-minute gunbattle.</p> <p>\"They were heavily armed. There was a fierce firefight during which one guard was killed and one of the hostage takers was killed,\" said the source. Three of the hostages were Arabs, while a fourth was from Asia.</p> <p>Mansour is the area from which the Briton Ken Bigley was seized.</p> <p>The latest kidnap came as splits began to appear within the Iraqi leadership over plans to launch an all-out assault on the rebel-held town of Falluja.</p> <p>The interim president, Ghazi al-Yawar, has rejected the coalition's handling of the crisis.</p> <p>Mr al-Yawar told the Kuwaiti daily al-Qabas: \"I completely disagree with those who see a need to decide [Falluja] through military action.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The coalition's handling of this crisis is wrong. It's like someone who fired bullets at his horse's head just because a fly landed on it; the horse died and the fly went away.\" </p> <p>His remarks seemed a direct challenge to the interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi.</p> <p>On Sunday, Mr Allawi warned Falluja leaders of imminent military action unless they agreed to cease insurgent activity, allow Iraqi security forces into the city and hand over foreign fighters loyal to the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al- Zarqawi.</p> <p>Iraqi and US officials believe the city is a base for up to 5,000 Islamist militants, Saddam Hussein loyalists and violent criminal gangs.</p> <p>US forces have been battling militants in Ramadi and Falluja daily, but have held back from an all-out offensive, saying the final decision rests with the Iraqi prime minister.</p> <p>Under the interim constitution passed in March, the presidency has limited powers, but many Iraqis see it as important for its symbolic value.</p> <p>The 45-year-old US-educated moderate Sunni and former exile has strong ties to Washington, although he has been sharply critical of the coalition. He also pointed a finger at neighbouring Iran.</p> <p>\"Iran is playing a negative role in Iraq,\" he said. \"It is behind the assassination of more than 18 Iraqi intelligence officers and is also playing a negative role in southern Iraq.\"</p> <p>The US yesterday pounded suspected rebel positions in Falluja, while fierce fighting raged between US forces and insurgents in nearby Ramadi.</p> <p>Local hospital officials said three people died in the clashes, including an Iraqi cameraman with Reuters.</p> <p>The agency said Dhia Najim was shot in the head as he filmed fighting near his house in the Andalus district. His footage showed gun flashes and smoke as US Humvees sped across a junction.</p> <p>Religious and community leaders in the restive cities north and west of Baghdad fear an all-out attack could backfire, provoking a general uprising among Iraq's once all-powerful Sunni minority and threatening the elections.</p> <p>\"What's needed is that the coalition forces continue dialogue so that the Iraqi armed forces will come, which will prompt those on the sidelines not to join the rebels... \" Mr al-Yawar said. </p> <p>The US said yesterday it had begun to increase troop numbers in Iraq to provide security for the January poll.</p> <p>A rise in the 160,000-strong multinational force is aimed at preventing rebels from trying to derail the poll, a US army spokesman said. He declined to say how many US troops would be on the ground for the elections. The US already has some 138,000 troops in Iraq.</p> <p>In Baghdad, another senior official fell victim to a wave of assassinations targeting Iraqis seen to be collaborating with US-led forces.</p> <p>Hatem Karim, the capital's deputy governor, was killed and two of his bodyguards were wounded in a drive-by shooting in the al-Dora district south of the city.</p> <p>The Army of Ansar al-Sunna militant group claimed responsibility.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Black Watch troops came under bombardment yesterday as rebels stepped up rocket attacks against their desert base at Camp Dogwood.

The sale also augurs well for the creation of a free market in natural gas across Europe, analysts said.

  "<b>\u00b7</b> Maxine Carr has, not for the first time, been forced to move. Her identity was discovered by locals, who, angered by her presence, made sure that her life would be a misery if she stayed. The police have taken her elsewhere. <p>This is an appalling example of the failure of the law. By court order, the media are strictly forbidden to reveal her whereabouts, new identity or anything to identify her in her new life. By and large, the injunction has been obeyed, though one or two papers have come close to allowing readers to work out where she was living. But the court order has failed to prevent her identity being sussed out (without the media's help) by local residents. The flurry of police activity that inevitably accompanied her moves into her new neighbourhoods aroused suspicion; and her distinctive appearance, seen so often on television, has proved difficult to disguise. </p> <p>The upshot is that Carr (unlike the killers of James Bulger) cannot, for a long time to come, look forward with any confidence to being left in peace and anonymity. She's paying a high price for a misguided association with a killer. It's a terrible reflection on our society. It's sad that the law is powerless to do anything about it. </p> <p> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> There are two astonishing aspects about the multi-million pound legal aid scam that came to light last week. The first is that some 21 employees - half the workforce - of the west country solicitors' firm Robinsons were involved. But how was the mastermind, Timothy Robinson, able to gather so many potential fraudsters around him? What was his hiring policy? Did he have some special insight which assessed the innate crookedness of those he took on? Or - and this is a far more depressing conclusion - was he confident that, once employees were offered sufficient inducements, greed would take over, and hitherto honest people, including solicitors, would turn criminal? </p> <p>Just as extraordinary, the public was kept ignorant of all the Robinsongate prosecutions for more than four years. Only last week was it revealed that several trials, including Robinson's, had taken place since 2000. He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. But because so many other cases against his employees were to follow, it was feared that if juries in subsequent trials knew the results of previous cases, especially Robinson's conviction, they could not avoid being prejudiced. So the judge made an order under section four of the Contempt of Court Act, postponing the reporting of all the trials until the last one finished. Such orders are not unusual, when there is a sequence of linked trials, but none, I'm sure, has lasted for so long. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> At least the secrecy imposed in the Robinson saga was in the cause of defendants getting a fair trial - a principle now threatened by the repulsive new law on giving the jury more information about an accused's criminal record. </p> <p>One thing I didn't mention last week was the unnecessary speed with which the law is being implemented - a haste which will itself lead to miscarriages of justice. It was originally announced that the law would come into force in April. It's now being rushed in next month. There will be no time to train judges on how to decide whether to allow a jury to be told of the accused's previous convictions. This is a fundamental issue. </p> <p>Central to the operation of the new law is the judge's discretion to disallow the defendant's past going before the jury if this would result in an unfair trial. Judges need guidance on how to make that crucial decision; they now won't be getting it for several months. This is especially important, as they'll be dealing with sex offences against children - which, according to research, is the category most susceptible to jury prejudice against a defendant with a history of the crime. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> We may yet be seeing the governor of California in the witness-box of an English court, being cross-examined about his alleged breast-fondling proclivities. Last Friday, Mr Justice Eady gave the go-ahead to Anna Richardson to sue Arnold Schwarzenegger and two of his aides for libel in the high court. Ms Richardson claims that the former Terminator groped her during an interview in London in 2000 (he denies it); she accuses his aides of damaging her reputation by alleging, in a Los Angeles Times article, that she had made it up. </p> <p>That article was also published on the internet. Because of that, the judge ruled, it was appropriate for the case to be heard in an English court.</p>",
  "Why has Yasser Arafat not \"groomed\" a successor (like some petty oriental despot), commentators have demanded to know in recent days, and why he is leaving a chaotic power-vacuum? What has been striking about these questions is not so much their wilful ignorance of the Palestinian reality, but the underlying assumptions they reflect. <p>The first is that the ailing Palestinian leader is now either marginal - or worse, the obstacle to peace. And the new hero of peace, as championed by the liberal press on the back of the Gaza disengagement plan, is now Ariel Sharon. This shows how closely the debate in this country has come to embracing the Israeli Likud view of the Palestinians. </p> <p>Most discussion of the Middle East conflict in the west now appears to be based on three premises: Arafat is not a partner for peace, but promotes terror; Arafat will not let go of the \"reins of power\", especially the security services; and Arafat is undemocratic and is blocking necessary reform of Palestinian institutions. </p> <p>But it is not the Palestinians who are refusing democracy and representation. They are struggling to hold on to it by any means they can. Instead, it is the US and Israeli governments who are seeking to create institutions that would be undemocratic, and to find Palestinian leaders who will be unrepresentative. We have no vacuum of power. We have the PLO and the Palestine National Council, we have a legislative council in the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>Yet since 2000, the Israeli, US and British governments have been working hard to impose a warlord to run Gaza after the \"disengagement\" (even though Israel will remain firmly in control there), as well as the remaining enclaves in the West Bank. They have been training him for this task in Britain - the very man who was responsible for what is widely regarded as having been the most corrupt of the Gaza security apparatuses. They want Arafat to cede control of the PLO, of which he is elected chairman, and the Palestinian Authority, of which he is the elected president, because they have found someone they believe they can control. </p> <p>Nonetheless, this warlord's putsch for power earlier this year failed, as it was rejected across the board by Palestinians - both critics and backers of Arafat - all aware that it was against real reform and the national interest. Yet Mohammed Dahlan is still described in the British press as a \"young reformer\" and his paid security gangs in Gaza are still portrayed as the \"new voices for reform\". </p> <p>When Arafat represents all Palestinians, as he has by refusing exile (he would never have left without an assurance he could return), as he did by refusing to sign away basic rights as demanded of him at Camp David, Palestinians support him. Palestinians know what they lose by continuing to fight for their freedom: their livelihood, their lives. But they support Arafat because he represents them. And because of that basic trust, he is the one leader who has been able to make the most compromises and exact the most difficult concessions from his own people. Arafat is, after all, the architect of the Oslo peace accords, in contrast to Ehud Barak and Sharon, who both voted against the accords in the Knesset. </p> <p>At the Camp David meetings in 2000, the then Israeli prime minister Barak insisted the Palestinians cede on central issues, such as Jerusalem and refugee rights. Since Arafat refused, Barak has never ceased to brand him a terrorist who wants the destruction of Israel, and blamed the continuing conflict on Arafat's refusal - rather than on Israel's failure to address any core issue, such as its increased settlement building during the Oslo years. </p> <p>Bill Clinton and Barak's post-Camp David spin that the Palestinians were offered everything and gave nothing in return has been comprehensively refuted, yet these myths are continually repeated in the UK and US press. </p> <p>Worse, these claims helped ignite the existential Israeli fears in the aftermath of that meeting, which Sharon fanned into a wall of fire, destruction, expansion and conquest in pursuit of a Greater Israel and the denial of any possibility of an independent Palestinian state. </p> <p>As Dov Weisglass, Sharon's senior adviser, spelled out last month: \"The significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process. And when you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state ... the disengagement is actually formaldehyde.\" Yet political leaders and journalists continue to praise the disengagement as \"a first step towards a peace process\". </p> <p>What these defenders of Likud strategy don't grasp is well understood by the Palestinians, who continue to support Arafat. In order to be a leader you must first represent your people, and not abandon them to their conquerors in times of foreign occupation or colonial rule. Arafat seeks peace, but not at any price. You can be a great leader in prison, in a broken-down compound, in hospital, even once you've given your life. That's why the Palestinians overwhelmingly voted for Arafat, and would do so again today. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Karma Nabulsi is a research fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, and a former PLO representative in Britain </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:karmanabulsi@hotmail.com\">karmanabulsi@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "Pakistan's upper house yesterday voted to allow President Pervez Musharraf to stay on as army chief despite his pledge to give up the post. <p>The bill, passed recently by the lower house, now needs to be signed by Gen Musharraf to become law.

  "French women won a small but significant victory over the mighty forces of Gallic bureaucracy yesterday with the publication of an amendment allowing children to bear their mothers' surnames. <p>Until now, under a law that like so many dates back to Napoleon, parents have had to pass on the name of the father. From January, they will be able to give \"either the name of the father, or the name of the mother, or the two surnames (in either order)\". </p> <p>The law still requires that the surname chosen for the first child of a couple must also be given to all following offspring. And it stipulates that in the event of the parents being unable to agree, \"the name of the father will prevail\". </p> <p>There are hardly any such restrictions in Britain. </p> <p>The amendment follows an earlier relaxation of France's strict naming laws. In 1993, the much-loathed official list of acceptable first names was scrapped, although public prosecutors can still intervene - at the request of anyone who makes a complaint - if the chosen name is thought likely to prove \"contrary to the interests of the infant\". </p> <p>French parents have since succeeded in giving their children such names as Ratatouille, Michel-Jacquesson, Lambada and even Cl\u00e9toris. </p> <p>A judge in Besan\u00e7on recently rejected Zebulon - which, as well as recalling the founder of one of the 12 tribes of Israel, is the French equivalent of Zebedee from the Magic Roundabout - on the grounds that \"its televisual connotations are manifestly likely to provoke sarcasm and mockery from which the child will not cease to suffer\". </p> <p>Besides pleasing French feminists, who welcomed it yesterday as \"a major step towards the equality of the sexes in France\", the latest amendment satisfies students of onomastics (the study of names), who have long argued that many precious regional and old French surnames would disappear unless the rule were relaxed.</p>",
  "The Chinese government declared martial law in the central province of Henan yesterday after some of the worst ethnic violence in recent memory left at least seven people dead. <p>Cars were overturned and houses torched in the bloody clashes between the Muslim Hui minority and the Han majority, which lasted several days and spread to at least 10 villages. The violence is thought to have been sparked by a traffic accident. </p> <p>Reflecting the government's concern to keep the lid on ethnic tensions, no reports of the confrontation have appeared in the domestic media and the worst affected area, around the town of Langchenggang, has been closed to reporters. </p> <p>At the nearest airport, in Zhengzhou, flights from mainly Muslim areas were diverted to other cities because of fears that sympathisers may have been flown in. </p> <p>A source in one village said thousands of military and civilian police were on patrol, adding: \"Order has been restored, but the situation is still very tense.\" </p> <p>The provincial government said seven people were killed and 42 injured. Local witnesses have reported more than 20 fatalities. A report in the New York Times, quoting local journalists, said 148 had died.</p>",
  "The actor Christopher Hancock, who has died aged 76, played the detestable heavy lorry driver Charlie Cotton in the early years of BBC1's EastEnders. Hancock was one of the first to join the EastEnders team, in 1985, but his part was written out via a convenient road crash and his association with the character made casting him in other roles more difficult. His other appearances included The Bill, Casualty, Miss Marple, Victoria Wood As Seen On TV and Oedipus At Colonus. <p>Born in County Durham, he was a chorister and a pupil of Durham cathedral school, and acquired a love of classical music. In the early 1950s, he attended the Old Vic School, and was a member of the Old Vic Company, where he established himself as a character actor. Even then, his dislike of projecting himself into the outside world, except through a proscenium arch, was noticed by some of his colleagues. </p> <p>He made a firm impression at the new Nottingham Playhouse of the 1960s when it was under the charismatic control of John Neville. Hancock was in the first production in December 1963 at the new theatre. Directed by Tyrone Guthrie, he and Leo McKern played the two Tribunes in Shakespeare's Coriolanus. </p> <p>At the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, he was in The Tempest, The Government Inspector and Amongst Barbarians. At the Royal Court Theatre, he was in London Cockolds, and in Harrogate he appeared in The Three Sisters, She Stoops To Conquer and School For Wives. </p> <p>His work continued to be praised. In the Greenwich Theatre's revival of Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane in 1993, he played the difficult role of the bizarrely weak and self-deluded \"Dada\".

  "One of the wealthiest and most powerful armed Islamists in north Africa, Amar Saifi, was yesterday behind bars in his home country of Algeria following the intervention of Libya's Muammar Gadafy. <p>Saifi was the number two in Algeria's main violent Islamist organisation, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), and responsible for the kidnapping of 32 foreign tourists in the Sahara desert last year. His group had pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden and he ran, in effect, a private army that roamed across the desert frontiers of several north African states. </p> <p>Mr Gadafy received praise from Washington for handing over Saifi to the Algerian government. \"This continues to show Libya's reintegration into world society and coming down on the side of law and order and the war on terrorism,\" a senior US military official told Reuters at the weekend. </p> <p>Saifi was reported to have been captured several months ago by a rebel, non-Islamist group from Chad, and it was unclear how he turned up in Libya last week. </p> <p>Press reports around the region have speculated either that Mr Gadafy threatened the Chad group with air attacks, or that he paid it for Saifi. </p> <p>Last year Saifi was reported to have extracted \u20ac5m (\u00a33.5m) from the German government in return for the release of 32 tourists kidnapped while on adventure holidays in the Algerian Sahara. A German woman died of heatstroke in captivity and German authorities had put out an international search warrant for Saifi. </p> <p>The Algerian daily El Watan reported at the weekend that Saifi, a former Algerian paratrooper who is half-French, had used the money to recruit fighters and buy weapons. </p> <p>Saifi, also known as Abderrezak El Para, had reportedly arranged marriages with the daughters of tribal leaders in northern Mali to ensure support there. His group also travelled through rugged desert areas of northern Chad and Niger. He was a main target for US special forces who had been training local soldiers in Chad, Mali and other countries around the Sahara in anti-terrorist tactics amid fears that al-Qaida style groups would find refuge in the remote region's barren, difficult terrain. </p> <p>US military sources said Saifi would have key knowledge about the region's armed Islamist groups. \"If he were willing to talk, he could probably tell them everything they needed to know to roll up most of the remaining folks,\" the US official told Reuters. Saifi reportedly lost many members of his group in a battle earlier this year in which US spotter planes helped direct the Chad army. </p> <p>A large quantity of weapons was also reportedly captured af ter some of his group were driven into the arms of the Algerian army by US-supported troops from Mali. Senior US generals suggested earlier this year that, after agreeing to dismantle his weapons of mass destruction programme, Mr Gadafy might play an important role against armed Islamists. </p> <p>Saifi's capture has coincided with an offer from Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of a fresh amnesty for Islamists who have taken part in a decade-long civil war that has claimed 150,000 lives.</p>",

Taymor's colourful movie is more interested in the latter than the former, but co-producer Salma Hayek takes her lead role very seriously; the likes of Alfred Molina as her philandering, Marxist husband Diego Rivera, and Geoffrey Rush in a small role as Leon Trotsky, help flesh out the heated political background. </p> <p><strong> Twelve Monkeys</strong><br> (Terry Gilliam, 1995)<br> 8pm, FilmFour <br>Brilliant but flawed science fantasy in which Bruce Willis is touchingly hangdog and quip-free as a man sent back in time to trace the origin of a virus which has wiped out most of mankind, all the while haunted by an image of his own death. Brad Pitt is the loopy leader of the Army of the 12 Monkeys, and the chief suspect; Madeleine Stowe is the doc helping Willis in his quest. </p> <p><strong> Equilibrium</strong> <br>(Kurt Wimmer, 2002)<br> 10pm, Sky Movies 1<br> An enjoyably dim sci-fi that's part Matrix, part Fahrenheit 451. We're in a coolly gleaming metallic futureworld where emotions are suppressed, and soppy types who insist on feelings are persecuted by holier-than-thou cops called Clerics. Christian Bale is one such, finding himself enticed by \"sense-offender\" Emily Watson into a world of love. </p> <p><strong> One Hour Photo</strong><br> (Mark Romanek, 2001)<br> 10pm, Sky Movies 2<br> As in Christopher Nolan's Insomnia, funnyman Robin Williams reveals a dark side to telling effect here. He's a supermarket photo processor filling in the gaps in his lonely life with a vicarious fascination for a local, loving family, the Yorkins (Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan and their son Dylan Smith): the pictures he develops for them are copied and stuck up on his crummy apartment wall, and little by little he starts thinking he's part of the family. It's a subtle and creepy portrait of a five-star weirdo, and a fine, nervy thriller.<br> Paul Howlett</p>",

  "<p>The 22-20s make the late, laconic entrance that befits devotees of Skip James, the Mississippi crooner whose 22-20 Blues gave them their name. Two support acts have come and gone by the time Sleaford's much-hyped \"acid-blues\" (their term) starlets slump aboard. Full marks already for posturing. Blame it on the arrogance of youth - the four have barely left their teens - which has been ramped up by forgivable self-belief. A year ago, they were the subject of intense pursuit by every major label, and though Franz Ferdinand may now be pop's shiniest band, the 22-20s haven't lost their slouchy confidence.</p> <p>If Skip James was their starting point, the group are now in thrall to 21st-century revivalists the White Stripes, as well as 1960s Brit-blues pioneers such as the Yardbirds. More specifically, this compact gig incorporates their breakneck, guitar-based intensity. Three or four songs in, though, it's clear that what the 22-20s lack is tunes and presentation. Songs rock past anonymously, all leathery husk and no juice. There's no doubting their musical proficiency, but while they play like demons, they're devoid of demonic charisma. </p> <p>The self-titled debut album forms the backbone of the show, but it's the singles 22 Days, Shoot Your Gun and Why Don't You Do It for Me? that more or less stand out. In particular, Why Don't You Do It for Me? is rather good, lit from within by gloomy minor chords and bad intent. A twitchy bassline makes Shoot Your Gun one of bassist Glen Bartup's big numbers, though every song, actually, is an excuse for him to lope around like a Labrador after a bee.</p> <p>A solitary acoustic number, Friends, draws attention to leader Martin Trimble's voice; those well-bred vowels are begging for mid-career retraining as a folk singer.</p> <p>Having said that, it's unsporting to expect perfection from people almost fresh from doing their GCSEs. Their album contains enough roughneck passion to confirm that the 22-20s are on the right track, and, eventually, their gigs will be something to watch.</p>",
  "Michel Berlins is right (Scrap this discredited libel system, October 29) that the Defamation Act 1952 has had its day. Ordinary people are not considered to have reputations in the way that public figures do, but may suffer just as much among their own circles. <p>Most people want a swift and appropriately prominent correction and apology when untruths are published. Very few of those who have come to MediaWise over the last 12 years have been seeking punitive damages. They wanted lies and distortion put right quickly. But they also want some indication that the perpetrators appreciate the damage caused. </p> <p>There would be no need for Berlins' proposed defamation authority if the media regulators (PCC and Ofcom) had the power to reimburse the cost of a complaint and award nominal compensation (perhaps based on a sliding scale according to the severity of the libel and the publication's circulation figures) and/or to levy fines (perhaps based on advertising revenue). </p> <p>Of course the best answer would be for all editors to acknowledge that press freedom includes the right to make mistakes, but not to ride roughshod over people's lives. The Council of Europe is currently proposing that all print publications should offer an automatic right of reply to those who are misrepresented - a right enjoyed in many European countries but not in the UK. Editors should welcome the idea. They have less to fear from a commitment to accuracy and the correction of errors than they have from the costly impact of the Defamation Act - which became law in 1952 only because the industry had failed to respond to the call of the first royal commission on the press for a body to deal with complaints. <br><b>Mike Jempson</b> <br>Director, MediaWise </p> <p>Two other anomalies in the present law can have especially disastrous effects on small organisations. One is that not only the author, editor or publisher of an allegedly offending item can be sued, but also bookshops or libraries with the item on their shelves. And even if a defendant wins the case in terms of damages, they still be bankrupted by the legal fees. </p> <p>An example of this is the way that one of London's last independent radical bookshops, Housmans, still has a five-figure debt to clear - following a notorious case when it was sued by someone criticised in an anti-fascist magazine it stocked - because the impecunious litigant who brought the case hasn't the resources to comply with the court order to pay the shop's costs. <br><b>Albert Beale</b> <br>Housmans Bookshop</p>",
  "The Canadian government signalled its intention yesterday to reintroduce legislation to decriminalise the possession of small amounts of marijuana. <p>Similar legislation, which drew sharp criticism from US officials and raised fears of tightened security at the Canada-US border, was scuttled in June by a federal election, which automatically kills off all outstanding bills. </p> <p>The idea is to replace criminal sanctions with fines for small amounts: 15g or about half an ounce in the previous legislation. </p> <p>US drug enforcement officials have warned that the relaxed laws could mean a surge in smuggling of potent Canadian marijuana. It is already a business worth about C$5bn (\u00a32.2bn) in the Pacific province of British Columbia. </p> <p>Opponents in both countries have also warned this could lead to longer queues at the border because of increased security. </p> <p>But the prime minister, Paul Martin, has said he did not want young users to have criminal records that could hurt their job prospects and block entry into the United States. </p> <p>Canadian police have also warned that reliable tests need to be developed to check whether motorists are under the influence of marijuana before decriminalising the drug. To that end, the government said it was introducing a separate bill yesterday to tackle drug-impaired driving.</p>",
  "Teams of Democratic and Republican lawyers were poised to start launching legal challenges in Florida and elsewhere from the moment the polls open today, without waiting until the close of voting to start disputing procedures at individual polling stations. <p>The Democrats, convinced that more vigorous challenges might have swung the result in 2000, claim to have 10,000 lawyers on standby around the country, ready to be deployed wherever the need arises. They reputedly have 1,000 in Florida alone, including Janet Reno, Bill Clinton's former attorney general. </p> <p>As several analysts noted yesterday, there seemed little chance that so much legal firepower would be willing to spend today doing nothing - especially if, as expected, thousands of voters are challenged by party poll workers. </p> <p>Florida's network of emergency judges could hear cases within 15 minutes of a request being made, prompting cross-county dashes by lawyers as they race to represent their side in court. </p> <p>Democrats may also argue that Republican challenges constitute interference with the election by causing long delays, even if they do not necessarily lead to legitimate voters being turned away. </p> <p>\"One of the effects is simply that it will consume time - and if the line is long, well, how long would you wait in the heat?\" said Terry Anderson, a leading law professor at the University of Miami. \"In minority districts, even if they aren't successful in their challenges, they may be successful in driving voters away.\" </p> <p>Local reports from counties around Florida suggest that signup lists, used by poll workers to indicate where they will be stationed today, show a heavy concentration of Republican activists in black areas, with far fewer in predominantly white neighbourhoods. \"It's beyond coincidence,\" Kendrick Meek, John Kerry's campaign chairman in Florida, told the Washington Post. </p> <p>But the biggest showdown, if it happens, probably will come after the result, providing that the outcome falls into the so-called \"margin of litigation\", the point at which a victory is narrow enough for challenging it to become politically feasible. </p> <p>Nobody dared speculate yesterday as to what that margin might be. But the most likely target for a rerun of 2000's \"chad wars\" is the provisional voting system, whereby voters who encounter eligibility problems at the polls can fill out a ballot anyway. </p> <p>Their vote, and the validity of their registration, is then assessed afterwards - a procedure that would seem to be an open invitation for head-to-head legal arguments that could drag on for days. </p> <p>Already yesterday, there were foreshadowings of disputes to come. </p> <p>In central Miami, lawyers for both sides were quibbling over absentee ballots that had been returned early, although Eric Buermann, one of the leading Republican attorneys, insisted his side were being \"compassionate challengers\" when dealing, for example, with shaky signatures by elderly voters. </p> <p>Lawyers have also been clashing in Palm Beach County, where the validity of a small number of absentee ballots - 44, as of yesterday morning - were being disputed either by Democrats or Republicans. </p> <p>\"Sending that many lawyers is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's legal analyst. \"You can't send 1,000 lawyers and say 'see if there's anything to do'. They will find something to do.\"</p>",
  "<p>The website is appropriately cryptic: \"Welcome to Spectronic Denmark - a leading developer and manufacturer of mission-critical electronic surveillance equipment. </p> <p>\"This site is strictly for the benefit of Government Agencies, Law Enforcement Agencies, Intelligence Agencies and Government Approved Companies.\" </p> <p>Welcome to the world of cyber spooks and electronic eavesdropping, internet intelligence-gathering and homeland security. </p> <p>Not that the website is vulgar enough to use the word spying. Spectronic simply provides \"solutions in the field of electronic surveillance\". </p> <p>Yesterday, aerospace company Cobham, better known for in-flight refuelling equipment and those little yellow oxygen masks that feature prominently in aircraft safety videos, paid \u00a321.1m to add Spectronic to its line-up of electronic wizardry. </p> <p>The UK company already owns several businesses involved in what it calls the homeland security market, including DTC Communications in the US, Micromill Electronics in the UK and Canada's Orion Electronics. </p> <p>\"All these businesses are positioned to benefit from increased priority and expenditure by the world's governments as part of anti-terrorism efforts,\" the company said in a statement. </p> <p>Spectronic, which was privately owned, was founded in 1983 and now sells to some 80 agencies around the world equipment which can monitor telephones and the internet. </p> <p>Its equipment, the website explains rather quaintly, \"can be excessively customised to meet any specific requirement\". </p> <p>\"Of special interest are their intercept products for internet applications, a rapidly growing market,\" according to Cobham chief executive Allan Cook. Though Spectronic, which employs 60 people, will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Cobham's DTC business, the two companies will continue to market and develop their products separately. </p> <p>Spectronic will remain based in Denmark. </p> <p>A Cobham spokesman said the group would continue to look for acquisitions in the surveillance sector. </p> <p>It is all a long way from the early days of Cobham when it worked on air-to-air refuelling systems before the second world war as the aircraft industry was devoting much effort to ways of giving passenger aircraft the range to cross the Atlantic. </p> <p>Now it could probably tell you, if not what they had for breakfast, at least what such passengers have entered into their laptops.</p>",

  "There was confusion today over the whereabouts of an American soldier who Iraqi police said had been seized by insurgents in Samarra. <p>The unnamed soldier was seized last night by gunmen in two Opel cars, according to a spokesman for the Samarra police.</p> <p>Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed Ahmed said the Americans had alerted Iraqi security forces and asked them to look out for the missing soldier. He added that US troops were out in force in the streets of the Sunni Muslim city, 60 miles north of Baghdad, today. </p> <p>However, the US military at first said it had no information about the incident. It subsequently denied the report, with a spokesman saying the 1st Infantry Division, whose operating area includes Samarra, had reported \"100% accountability of their soldiers at this time\". </p> <p>Iraqi forces stormed Samarra early last month, as part of the US-backed interim government's campaign to retake rebel areas before Iraq's national elections, scheduled for January. </p> <p>A roadside bomb exploded in the city today, killing a member of an Iraqi national guard convoy. In Baghdad, a car bomb exploded outside the education ministry, killing at least eight people and wounding about 10.</p> <p>And, in Mosul, another car bomb targeted an Iraqi military convoy, killing four civilians and wounding up to 12 soldiers.</p> <p>Iraqi police said the attack was an assassination attempt on the commander of a special task force in the Iraqi army, but that General Rashid Feleih had escaped uninjured. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the US military said a Reuters cameraman who was killed in Ramadi yesterday had died in a gun battle between marines and insurgents. </p> <p>\"Marines from the 1st Marine Division of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force engaged several insurgents in a brief small arms firefight that killed an individual who was carrying a video camera earlier Monday morning,\" it said in a statement.</p> <p>Reuters said, however, that video footage of the incident showed no fighting and no sounds of shooting before Dhia Najim was killed by a single bullet in the back of the neck. He had filmed heavy clashes between marines and insurgents earlier in the day, but that fighting had subsided, Reuters said. </p> <p>The news agency said Najim's colleagues and family believed he had been shot by a US sniper.</p> <p>David Schlesinger, Reuters managing editor, said: \"We reject the clear implication in the marines' statement that Dhia was part of an insurgent group. \"This claim is not supported by the available evidence.

  "<p>TalkSport founder Kelvin MacKenzie was accused today of talking \"hot air\" in the press and of using his legal battle with the radio audience measurers Rajar to court publicity for his radio company.</p> <p>Rajar's barrister Nick Green QC said Mr MacKenzie's motives for taking Rajar to court over its delay in adopting a new electronic measurement system had been to generate publicity.</p> <p>\"There's a marked difference between the cautious and conservative pleaded case and what can only be described as hot air that has been ventilated in the press,\" Mr Green said.</p> <p>\"In the press Mr MacKenzie has accused Rajar of fraud, not a case that is advanced in the pleading. It's reflective of a fact that we say underlies this case which is that its all about publicity, it being a truism that all publicity is good publicity.\"</p> <p>Mr Green was speaking at a high court hearing to decide whether Mr MacKenzie's case against Rajar should go ahead.

But it's not going to be easy, according to the Greek side's manager Zdenek Scasny: \"I like my team to play a physical game and be strong,\" he boomed, punchily dancing along to the Village People's Macho Man. \"We will play in London like we did in Athens.\"</p> <p>Worried? Not Arsenal. \"We are quite strong as well and we are not worried,\" countered Patrick Vieira. \"We have some physical players too\". But as news filtered through that Robert Pires and Cesc Febregas will start in place of Jose Antonio Reyes and Edu, Arsene Wenger was more circumspect. \"We are perhaps not as naturally strong as we were in the air,\" he admitted. \"We need to be more commanding.\" Something that isn't exactly easy when Pascal Cygan is in your starting XI.</p> <p>Follow CSKA Moscow v Chelsea with Sean Ingle NOW: http://football.theguardian.com/news/matchreport/0,9752,1341697,00.html</p> <p>And Arsenal v Panathinaikos with Barry Glendenning from 7.30pm: http://football.theguardian.com/news/matchreport/0,9752,1341699,00.html</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ADVERT</strong></p> <p>The Rolling Stones - Live Licks 2 CD set released 1st November. 23 songs-11 never previously recorded live.

So you can imagine the pain we feel seeing the Saints suffering in the nether regions like a flasher with frostbite. Still, at least Lowe had some better news today: for the FA have agreed to press charges over alleged attempts by Aston Villa to tap up James Beattie!</p> <p>The Saints had sensed something was amiss earlier this season when Villa boss David O'Leary spluttered: \"There's a player [at Southampton] who definitely wants to join us. I think he sees the way we play is good for strikers and that he will get a few goals.\" And the FA obviously agree, with a blazer today announcing: \"We looked into the matter and took the decision to charge Villa with [cue rumbling drums for dramatic effect] making an alleged illegal approach!\"</p> <p>Southampton reckon O'Leary's words \"contravene Premier League rules, which state a club cannot approach a player directly without his club's permission unless he's in the final six months of his contract\". And while Villa \"strenuously deny\" making any indecent proposals, if found guilty, they face a fine and, possibly, a points deduction. Unfortunately for Rupert, any points docked will not be passed on to Southampton, so their rendezvous with relegation is still very much on.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>WIN! WIN!

  "As the blogger <a href=\"http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2004/07/Hystericallyshriekingleft.shtml\">Steven Den Beste</a> wrote: \"I was tired of the November 2004 election in November 2003.\" Me, too. By this time tomorrow, God willing and the creeks don't rise (as we say in these parts), we'll know who won. <p>I hope it is Bush, of course, and the final round of polling makes that look likely. But polls are always doubtful, and I have trusted them even less than usual this cycle. But more, even, than I hope for a Bush win, I hope that whoever wins gets a clear victory. Otherwise - especially as no one has chosen to take <a href=\"http://www.techcentralstation.com/110502A.html\">my advice on dealing with voter fraud</a> - we may be in for a rerun of the 2000 election, with all the partisanship and rancour that it involved. </p> <p>That was bad back then, when we were all still drowsing in the afterglow as the dot-com bubble deflated, and when the only people who realised we were at war with terrorists who wanted to bring down the west were the terrorists themselves. It would be worse now, when - after elections in Afghanistan and a notable lack of success by the terrorists in Iraq - the war is going well enough that even Osama bin Laden is <a href=\"http://belmontclub.blogspot.com/2004/10/osama-bin-ladens-surrender-proposal.html\">trying to sound reasonable</a>. </p> <p>Division in wartime is bad, and those people who feel the war hurts their domestic political interests would like us to forget that we are, in fact, at war - and winning. Still, the division in America has been quite noticeable and, contrary to the received wisdom, it existed both before, and immediately after, September 11 2001. As the blogger Larry Ribstein <a href=\"http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2004/10/a_reflection_on.html\">notes</a>:</p> <p>\"As the lefties age, folks who used to pride themselves on tolerance now turn to virulent and destructive hatred. They justify their attitude by speaking of the intolerance of those they hate - of gays, of the poor, of African-Americans, etc. They also claim to be disturbed by Bush's inflexibility and insularity. But hatred distorts their vision. They ignore, for example, the irony that these supposed lovers of all the world's people should scorn Bush's idealism, denigrate the Iraqis' impulse for freedom and despair about the economic rise of third world countries at the expense of our own jobs. And in any event such hatred cannot be justified by the supposed errors of its target ...\"</p> <p>Bush-hatred antedated Iraq. Consider the following excerpts from an email Michael Moore broadcast on September 12 2001. It is worth reading now, a couple of days before the election (and a couple of days after OBL has officially taken credit for 9/11):</p> <p>\"Many families have been devastated tonight. This just is not right. They did not deserve to die. If someone did this to get back at Bush, then they did so by killing thousands of people who DID NOT VOTE for him! Boston, New York, DC, and the planes' destination of California - these were places that voted AGAINST Bush! Why kill them? Why kill anyone? Such insanity ... Let's mourn, let's grieve, and when it's appropriate let's examine our contribution to the unsafe world we live in.\"</p> <p>As Ribstein continues: \"Reflect on what this initial reaction to 9/11 says about the attitudes of Moore, and of those in his wide and enthusiastic audience. A day after 9/11, Moore's impulse was to blame Bush and his policies. As the identity and nature of our attackers became apparent, Moore and his friends had to devise more elaborate explanations of how Bush was at fault.\" </p> <p>Indeed. Since then, Moore has likened the terrorists in Iraq to the minutemen of the American revolution and spun elaborate conspiracy theories. The Lord Haw-Haw of this war, he has become rich and famous attacking his own countrymen.</p> <p>But Moore is a symptom, not the disease. America, and the west in general, has somehow bred a class of elites who think that their own countries, and societies, are presumptively wrong. Hit from outside, their first instincts are to look inward - to conspiracies, or to some sort of flaw that might justify the attacks. Say what you will of the old-time elites, but at least they did not suffer from this vice. </p> <p>It has been hard for Bush to run a war in the face of this sort of attitude. I think that it will be impossible for Kerry to do so, since it is endemic among many of his strongest supporters. Will the American electorate agree with me?

  "<p><strong>Q</strong> What is the possibility of a building society or its offshore branch going bust? Has one ever done so?

The FSCS replaced the Building Societies Investor Protection Scheme and the Deposit Protection Scheme, among others, in 2001.</p> <p>The scheme covers up to 100% of the first \u00a32,000 on deposit plus 90% of the next \u00a333,000 in the relatively unlikely event of a bank or building society going bust, so the maximum money protected is \u00a331,700. </p> <p>However, FSCS does not cover the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.

  "<p>More than a million bed days were saved last year due to a sharp reduction in the number of older people needlessly stuck in hospital, the government said today.</p> <p>Ministers said the drop in the number of delayed discharges vindicated their controversial fines for councils that fail to promptly arrange community-based care for elderly people well enough to leave hospital.</p> <p>The findings came in a report by the older people's tsar, Professor Ian Philp, which showed an \"across the board\" improvement in health and social services for elderly people.</p> <p>He said: \"There's no doubt that health and social care is getting better for older people. We're talking about an across the board change from treatment to rehabilitation.\"</p> <p>The report, Better Health in Old Age, set out the progress made towards meeting the targets of the older people's national service framework, published in 2001.</p> <p>It hailed achievements in preventing age discrimination and developing better services to deal with stroke, falls and mental health.</p> <p>But Prof Philp warned that services must continue to improve and expand to meet the need of an increasingly ageing population. He said that his future priorities were increasing the promotion of healthy living to older people, and giving them and their families more choice and control over care services.</p> <p>The community care minister, Stephen Ladyman, said that in future he expected the NHS and social services to provide older people with a range of activities to improve their health and wellbeing - from tai chi to mountain climbing, to driving gokarts, to ballroom dancing.</p> <p>But Mr Ladyman admitted there had been poor take-up of a flagship scheme to give older people direct control over their care. He said that relatively few older people had so far opted to take up the direct payments scheme, whereby they are given the funds to purchase their own care, due to its perceived complexity.</p> <p>Mr Ladyman said the government was considering setting up a halfway scheme giving older people \"personal budgets\", so they knew how much was spent on their care but leaving social services to arrange the support they need.</p>",

  "<b>Gambling bill</b> <br>The government's majority was halved as 29 Labour backbenchers rebelled against plans that would allow huge Las Vegas-style casinos to open in Britain. Voting was 286 to 212 at the end of the gambling bill's second reading debate. <p>The Labour former minister Frank Field (Birkenhead) openly urged colleagues to defy the whips and vote against the bill, or abstain, to win later concessions. \"The more of us who say to the government that we are unhappy with this proposal, that we are going to vote against or abstain, the more power we will have when we come to the report stage,\" he said.</p> <p>The culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, admitted surprise over the \"level of fury\" directed at the legislation but promised to listen to constructive calls for changes. She insisted the bill would help to protect the \"weak and the vulnerable\" through better regulation and offered new concessions to try to appease critics.</p> <p>Ms Jowell said councils could be obliged to consult local people over whether to put a super-casino in their area. She also said a loophole in the rules would be closed to prevent casinos obtaining planning permission \"through the back door\". \"There will be no new casinos if local people don't want new casinos,\" she said.</p> <p>Labour's Donald Anderson (Swansea E), chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, demanded: \"Don't you see the world of difference between ordinary folks who want to go to bingo halls and the proliferation of mega-casinos? Why can't you have a few pilots so you can test your own views against what will happen in the real world?\"</p> <p>The shadow culture secretary, John Whittingdale, said Tories backed provisions on remote gambling, the creation of a new offence of inviting children to gamble and the establishment of a gambling commission. On casinos, they accepted the case for relaxation in some areas but caution was \"absolutely essential\" over the proliferation of regional casinos.</p> <p>Earlier, Ms Jowell had said problem gambling was \"likely to increase\" without the government's reforms. But she conceded that more gambling opportunities could create more problem gamblers.</p> <p><b>Opium harvest</b><br>New figures will show a \"significant increase\" in the cultivation of opium poppies in Afghanistan, the Foreign Office conceded. And only drought and disease in the country will have kept the rise in actual production relatively lower, it predicted. The latest assessment, by the UN office on drugs and crime, will be published on Thursday. The junior minister Bill Rammell said: \"The figures are not yet available. However, we anticipate a significant increase in cultivation levels this year.\"</p> <p><b>Veteran turnout</b><br>The number of servicemen and women on voting lists has fallen \"alarmingly\" since the electoral commission changed the rules so they have to re-register annually, the Tory Andrew Tyrie (Chichester) said. He protested that it was \"a disgrace that, particularly at this time, so many servicemen may find themselves without a vote at the next general election\". Replying for the speaker's committee on the electoral commission, Tory Peter Viggers (Gosport) said the chairman of the commission, Sam Younger, had told him he intended to work with the Ministry of Defence to address the issue.</p> <p><b>Arms embargo</b><br>Reports that UK-made weapons had been illegally exported to Sudan were denied by the Foreign Office minister Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean. She said: \"We rigorously enforce the European Union arms embargo, in place since 1994. We believe the United Nations statistics are inaccurate and we have already asked the UN to correct their records.\"</p> <p><b>Talking at the wheel</b><br>People found guilty of using a hand-held mobile phone while driving could face a \u00a360 fine and get three penalty points on their licence, Lord Davies of Oldham, for ministers, warned. He said the 25% reduction in the practice by car drivers since September 2003 was \"not as good as we would have hoped\" and told peers: \"When legislative time permits, we should increase the penalty for the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving, making it an endorsable offence.\"</p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The health secretary, John Reid, and his ministers face the Commons at question time. The remaining stages of the children's bill are set to be cleared. Backbench debates topics in Westminster Hall include disability benefits and childcare strategy. The Lords debates Commons amendments to the armed forces (pensions and compensation) bill and the domestic violence, crime and victims bill.</p>",
  "<p>Police were today investigating a burglary at the Equestrian Federation of Ireland just hours after it emerged that a drug test sample from an Olympic gold medal-winning horse had gone missing. </p> <p>The latest twist in the Irish Olympic controversy came when Avril Doyle, president of the federation, revealed that the door of the office in County Kildare had been forced and a cabinet rifled through. </p> <p>News of the break-in came hours after EFI officials sought an urgent meeting with the world equestrian body, the Federation Equestre Internationale, after a sample from Cian O'Connor's horse Waterford Crystal went missing after it was sent to a UK testing laboratory. </p> <p>Dope tests released in October revealed that Waterford Crystal had traces of a sedative in his system while competing in the Athens Olympics in August. </p> <p>Both O'Connor and his vet, James Sheeran, have repeatedly insisted they did nothing wrong. </p> <p>O'Connor exercised his right to have a second so-called B sample tested at the Horseracing Forensic Laboratory near Newmarket in Cambridgeshire after the A sample tested positive. But the sample never arrived. </p> <p>Commenting on last night's break-in at the EFI, Ms Doyle, who is also an Irish MEP, said: \"In the context of an international investigation involving Lausanne in Switzerland and Cambridgeshire in the UK, this is not just your ordinary break-in. Well, it may be an ordinary break-in but I am afraid the coincidence is rather too much.\" </p> <p>Ms Doyle said she did not know if anything had been taken. </p> <p>Gardai confirmed officers were examining the scene after they received a call shortly before 8am. </p> <p>The FEI revealed yesterday that a portion of Waterford Crystal's B sample was \"illegally taken\" in Cambridgeshire on October 21 while it was being transported from a Paris lab for testing. </p> <p>The FEI said the sample was being shipped by an independent courier service from the Medication Control Programme Central Laboratory in Paris to the Horseracing Forensic Laboratory. </p> <p>Police in Cambridgeshire and Lausanne, where the FEI is based, were informed and were investigating the case. </p> <p>On last night's break-in Ms Doyle said: \"As far as I can tell, nothing relating to this case in question, in relation to the Athens drug-testing, was disturbed, but that is pending confirmation from the gardai and the secretary general. </p> <p>\"Given the juxtaposition to developments yesterday and the international investigation, we have to treat this very seriously indeed.\" </p> <p>O'Connor's lawyer, Andrew Coonan, said he and the 24-year-old showjumper had known nothing until yesterday about the disappearance of the sample. </p> <p>O'Connor's vet Mr Sheeran has said the sample tested positive due to a sedative the horse was given while undergoing hydrotherapy. He said he could not understand how this medication could be found in the A sample a month later and it was not a performance-enhancing substance. </p> <p>Eddie Macken, the former trainer of the Olympic team, joined other leading equestrian figures in calling for an inquiry to take place into the whole affair. </p> <p>\"It sounds very, very strange. I really think the only way to get to the bottom of this is there has to be an inquiry into this right from the top level,\" the renowned showjumper said. </p> <p>\"All everybody wants to know is the truth, everybody's name to be cleared and I am sure that Cian O'Connor would like this very much as well. I think really this has to start with the FEI right from the top back down and the whole thing has to be traced down along.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Cambridgeshire Police said: \"On Tuesday October 26, the police were notified that a urine sample from a horse, which had participated in an equestrian event, was believed to have been stolen on Thursday October 21. </p> <p>\"The sample was due to have been delivered by couriers to the Horse Racing Forensic Laboratory on Newmarket Road in Fordham, Cambridgeshire. However, the sample never arrived. </p> <p>\"The courier company delivered the package, which was signed off. There appears to have been an error with the delivery when the sample was discovered to be missing or stolen.\"</p>",
  "\"My earliest memory is of a lawnmower,\" wrote Derek Jarman on a page ripped out of an A4 exercise book. It was 1991, his health and eyesight were failing, his elegant, swooping italic hand was unravelling a little, but he was still scribbling down his thoughts on gardens and gardening, subjects close to his heart and inextricably bound up with his output as filmmaker and writer. <p>Some of his late manuscripts and notebooks - covers beautifully personalised with gold or black impasto, full of poems, jottings and memories - will be revealed this week at an exhibition at the British Library in London.</p> <p>Jarman kept 16 volumes of diaries recounting the making of his garden at Prospect Cottage, on the Kent coastline, where he moved in 1988. Here he created a curious Eden in the most hostile, salt-caked, windswept environment imaginable, a strange garden full of twisted metal and driftwood, in the shadow of the Dungeness nuclear power station.</p> <p>Much of the material from the notebooks was incorporated into his published diaries, Modern Nature, but the exquisite objects themselves, two of which the British Library has borrowed from Jarman's estate, have never before been seen in public.</p> <p>Jarman's first notebook, dated January-February 1989, begins with the inscription: \"Yesternight I set out from the bright city, to the fifth quarter of the globe. Here winter is the coldest. The salt sea marsh is mapped in darkness.\"</p> <p>Beside it is a plan of his plot, in its very early days, charting clumps of sea kale, rosemary and curry plant. He pressed a tiny daffodil between the leaves.</p> <p>The exhibition will also show a large album, full of poems and notes towards his film The Garden. It was the nearest he came to a shooting script for the work, which posited Dungeness as an allegorical landscape in which Christ's life is retold.</p> <p>\"To whom it may concern, from the fifth quarter of the Globe,\" it is inscribed. Inside are drafts of poems, photographs, and the odd bit of practical detail on the film - a list of possible locations for the first couple of days' shooting.</p> <p>According to Jamie Andrews, a curator of the exhibition The Writer in the Garden, the notion of time in gardening - its cyclical nature - was fundamental to Jarman's aesthetics. \"The fact that cinema, by contrast, is always to a certain extent linear frustrated him. He always said that the garden was the absolute centre for him.\"</p> <p>The very late loose-leaf notes, according to Mr Andrews, retain Jarman's wit and warmth, despite failing health. He died in 1994.</p> <p>He recounts memories of gardens he knew in his youth, from the dispiriting suburban rectangles of post-war Britain to the decadence of the gardens on Lake Maggiore in Italy.</p> <p>\"In the garden he coalesced all the elements of his art,\" Mr Andrews said. \"It was also a defiant statement - that he could make something flourish out of the wilderness.\"</p> <p><b>Art and the posies</b></p> <p><b>From 1991 loose-leaf notes</b> </p> <p>\"I was always a passionate gardener. Flowers sparkled in my childhood as they do in a medieval manuscript. Daisies - white and red - daisy chains on the lawn fortresses of grass clippings\"</p> <p>\"My first garden tool was a little trowl (sic) with which I kept the flower beds in front of the Nissen hut in order.\"</p> <p>\"I am so glad there are no lawns at Dungeness. The worst lawns, and for that matter the worst gardens, are along the coast at Bexhill in close and crescent. These are the \"gardens\" that would give Gertrude Jekyll a heart attack or make her turn in her grave. Lawns, it seems to me, are against nature...\" </p> <p><b> From poetry notebook, inscribed Prospect Cottage February 1990, an unpublished extract from an unfinished poem closely based upon the Song of Solomon, ch IV, verse 16 </b> </p> <p>\"awake O north wind </p> <p>and come O south wind! </p> <p>blow up on my garden </p> <p>let its fragrance be wafted abroad </p> <p>let my beloved come to my garden....\"</p>",
  "In October 1953, Frank \"Speedy Pete\" Everest flew a YF100 Super Sabre jet at 755.149mph to take the world outright air speed record. It was one of many achievements by the United States Air Force (USAF) aviator, who has died aged 84. Many of them were in Bell X1, X1B and X2s rocket planes - which, unlike the YF100, did not qualify for conventional world air speed record status. <p>In 1949, Everest established an unoffical altitude record when he took an X1 nearly 14 miles high. In 1956 he became, fleetingly the \"fastest man alive\" when he hit Mach 2.9 (1,957 mph) in an X2, surpassing Chuck Yeager's record of three years earlier. </p> <p>Postwar, Everest had been detailed to the USAF's flight test mission, first in Ohio, then, in 1951, at Edwards air force base in California. It was a location where elite flyers such as Everest and Yeager - the first man to break the sound barrier in 1947 - flew the experimental X-planes. Their exploits were documented by Tom Wolfe in his 1979 best-seller, The Right Stuff, and the subsequent Hollywood film of 1983. </p> <p>Everest flew, or worked on the test programmes for, a catalogue of USAF cold war technology. There was the delta-winged Convair XF-92 and the Boeing YB-52 prototype, the Convair B57 Hustler and the Douglas B66. And there were the \"century series\" of supersonic fighters, the F100, the F101 Voodoo, F102 Delta Dagger, F104 Starfighter, F105 Thunderchief, and the F106 Delta Dart. </p> <p>Like Yeager, his more famous contemporary, Everest was born in West Virginia. He became interested in flying at the age of eight when he watched \"in wide-eyed wonder\" intrepid pilot Skyland Scottie bring his flying display to Everest's home town of Fairmont. \"I loved the speed and I loved the air,\" he recalled. </p> <p>After high school and Fairmont State College, he studied engineering at West Virginia University. There it was that he learned to fly in a Piper Cub as part of a military programme to train civilians in anticipation of war. </p> <p>In November 1941, he joined the US Army Air Force's training programme and was commissioned in July 1942. He went on to fly 94 sorties in the North African and Italian theatres, shooting down two German aircraft. Posted to China, he completed 67 missions there and destroyed four Japanese planes before being shot down in his P51 Mustang fighter over Hankow. </p> <p>Taken prisoner and brutally beaten, he refused to say anything, led to a bloodstained wooden block, he was ordered to kneel and put his neck upon it as the officer raised his sword Everest shouted \"Stop\" and promised to talk. He had recalled that, under the Geneva Convention, pilots could give information on the plane in which they had been shot down. So he related details - but almost all were erroneous. </p> <p>His book The Fastest Man Alive, co-written with John Guenther, was published in 1958. After his test flying, Everest took several other USAF commands, finally leaving the air force in 1973 as a brigadier general. He then worked as a test pilot for the Sikorsky company before retiring to Arizona. </p> <p>His many awards included the American Distinguished Flying Cross (with two oak leaf clusters), and the Legion of Merit (with two clusters). He was inducted in 1989 into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio. </p> <p>He married his hometown sweetheart Avis Mason in 1942. She predeceased him and he is survived by two daughters and a son. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Frank Kendall Everest, aviator, born August 10 1920; died October 1 2004</p>",
  "<p>One of Ed Ruscha's recent paintings of sunlit, snow-capped mountains has the following words written on it in large capital letters: REVIEW IT LOOK IT OVER AND WHAT EVER. Actually, the words aren't so much written on top of the depiction of the mountain as inscribed within the work, the crisp lettering clear, clean and as virgin as the snow itself. Each word has the momentous authority of an alp; they shout, as though to start an avalanche. </p> <p>That's nature for you. A sulky California teenager might wave it away with a dismissive \"Whatever\". Comparatively, the Los Angeles-based artist's \"What Ever\" comes across as positively Wordsworthian. As for \"Review It\", I take this as a challenge, but it is a tall order. The trouble with natural grandeur is that, when faced with the sublime, words fail. Even the poets are superfluous. In Ruscha's mountain paintings the American Sublime is just something else to be consumed. Over the pine trees, the gulleys and scree, the words PAY NOTHING UNTIL APRIL loom, reminding us that even a view comes on an instalment plan. </p> <p>Perhaps Ruscha is talking about mortality here, the swiftness of life. It wouldn't surprise me. One reads all those paintings he has done featuring the words \"The End\", ostensibly depicting the grainy, crackly, scratched celluloid captions that appear at the conclusion of old movies, almost as apocalyptic pronouncements. Ruscha, after all, is a lapsed Catholic who, true to type, has never entirely escaped his upbringing. The end is always with us. </p> <p>More than anything, Ruscha's exhibition - Paintings, Drawings, Photographs, Books - at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh, is full of words. The show is a good primer to his work, which, since its beginnings in the early 1960s, has had connections with pop art, minimalism and what came to be called conceptualism, without ever fitting neatly into any of the categories. Ruscha has pretty much gone his own way. Artists, in any case, are often testy about being pigeonholed. \"Artists Who Make Pieces. Artists Who Do Books\" say another pair of works, as though Ruscha were alerting us to how quibbling and inane definitions frequently are. </p> <p>I am driven, however, to the conclusion that Ruscha is one of those artists who often make big paintings when they shouldn't. The larger his work gets, the more inert. Only rarely can he carry the scale. A widescreen 1987 canvas of a line of silhouetted 18th-century ships riding the swell, called Parts Per Trillion, somehow needs its breadth to carry a sense of space, and to make you think of what the title might possibly mean. Another very wide, narrow work depicting the ray of projected light heading for a distant cinema screen is, however, just too illustrational. Better Ruscha's smaller Miracle paintings, with their sacred shafts of Hollywood-ised celestial light. </p> <p>Ruscha's art carries most weight when it is lighter in touch, often when he is working on paper. It doesn't much matter if you call these drawings or paintings: they are what they are, and have a kind of affecting, sly cool. One small pastel, with a plain, dark-brown surface, bears the following words: Smells Like Back of Old Hot Radio. I know exactly what Ruscha means, or I think I do: the hot brown Bakelite, scorched dust smell of old valve radios takes me immediately to a faraway place, twirling the dial. How evocative this is. </p> <p>At times, Ruscha might appear dumb and silly. How do we parse \"Honey hand me the can of nu-smell please\", or the vivid green work, with its indication of shadowy foliage cast on grass, emblazoned with \"ASIAN GOLF COURSE COMMANDOS\"? But I think I understand \"HOLLYWOOD TANTRUM\", with its nasty pinkish background, well enough. </p> <p>As well as painting, Ruscha, who studied design in a Walt Disney-sponsored art college, toyed with the idea of becoming an architect. Like most art students in America at the time, he had a fling with abstract expressionism, and was knocked out when he first saw reproductions of early Jasper Johns. In the 1960s, Ruscha picked up a camera and started to make small books featuring peculiar and mundane series of photographs. These include Twenty Six Gasoline Stations (1962), shot on a journey through California, Texas and Oklahoma; Thirty Four Parking Lots, with overhead shots of the layouts and markings of, well, almost empty parking lots; books of apartment buildings, records (album sleeves on the left page, the vinyl discs on the right), vacant real estate lots. A Few Palm Trees is a 64-page book with only 14 illustrations. We should take the word \"few\" to mean what it says. My favourite, Various Small Fires, has 16 photos including a stove, a cigar, a burning matchbook, a welding torch and a lighter, ending with a picture of an empty plate and a glass of milk. Is the milk for heartburn? </p> <p>Ruscha's little books have had many fans (me among them), and in their witty cataloguing of the everyday world - their understated style and design - is a kind of precise visual poetry of the unspectacular. But they are more than that, even in their incompleteness: they seem to say you can't have everything, only a fragment of the world. Every Building on the Sunset Strip, 1966, is a long, single sheet of paper, folded concertina-style, along which run two continuous strips of motorised photographs showing every inelegant office, shop and showroom. Ruscha still goes back there, taking photographs of makeovers. I see these photographic works as cousins to the relentless projects of D\u00fcsseldorf photographers Berndt and Hilla Becker, with their records of half-timbered houses on the Ruhr, of cooling towers, pit-heads and water holding tanks. In both cases, this is art-as-list, detailing sameness and particularity, formal regularity and difference. These images encourage you to look, too. </p> <p>For Ruscha words are also images, in that they provoke the imagination of the viewer. But we mustn't leap to the conclusion that his work is a conscious response to Ferdinand de Saussure or Roland Barthes, to semiotics and the great raft of continental philosophy. We all know that signs frequently say more, or something other, than they intend. Isn't California full of signs; isn't everything a sign for something else in Tinseltown? </p> <p>In interviews, Ruscha has expressed frustration at never quite being regarded as at the centre of things. He has gone his own way, and last week it was announced that he is, at 67, to be the official US artist at the next Venice Biennale. If curators have never known how to place him, younger artists have for years been following him. Somehow he is less intimidating than his peers. </p> <p>Ruscha's words and images want to tell stories. A depiction of blurry fenceposts in sepia light carries the inscription: \"If You Was Him You'd Do The Same Thing He Did.\" We don't need to know who did what; instead, we might recall a movie or two, gaze over that fence and think about making a run for it. In another painting, the word ACE, in large letters, stands on the horizon, under a murky sky reminiscent of Dorothy's Kansas. Where does the Yellow Brick Road go to? It leads to magic and disillusionment. So does Ruscha's art. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ed Ruscha: Paintings, Drawings, Photographs, Books is at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, from tomorrow until January 16.

  "<p>Walk into any campus in the country, and you will see compelling evidence that British universities are becoming more diverse. There are more international students and more from ethnic minorities; more mature students and more with disabilities. Admissions of female students have soared, and state school students mix freely with those from independent schools.</p> <p>On the surface, it might seem that the utopian vision of equal access to higher education for all is fast becoming a reality. However, if the rash of discrimination lawsuits in recent years is anything to go by, the potential for discrimination and harassment within the education system has never been greater. Now a number of British universities are hoping to nip discrimination in the bud by offering diversity training to students.</p> <p>Diversity training is already widespread for university staff, but this is the first time it has been extended to the student body. With fewer than one in 10 white Britons socialising outside their own ethnic group, the aim is to raise awareness of the advantages of social diversity and discourage behaviour that can lead to accusations of discrimination and harassment.</p> <p>The benefits for students can be enormous, according to Mike Hill, chief executive of the government graduate recruitment service, Prospects. \"Students with diversity training will be better all-round employees,\" he says. \"We live in an increasingly diverse society and it is obviously an advantage if students can engage with people from all sorts of backgrounds when they go out to work.\"</p> <p>Employment legislation is the driving force behind diversity training in the workplace. New laws are being introduced from Europe that will make it illegal for an employer to discriminate on the grounds of race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion or age by 2006. Similar forces are driving the campaign to educate students about diversity. Under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, higher education institutions have a legal responsibility to eliminate discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and good race relations on campus.</p> <p>One of the universities in the frontline of diversity training for students is Harper Adams University College in Shropshire. The university is planning to pilot online diversity training for its business management students early in 2005. Following assessment and evaluation, diversity training will then be rolled out to the entire student body as part of the university's professional skills programme.</p> <p>Nick Gallagher-Hughes, staff development officer at Harper Adams, says: \"One of the requirements of the Race Relations Act is that we make our student body aware of diversity issues,\" he says. \"However, we are also looking at this from a commercial point of view. We wanted to get the message across to the student body that students with diversity awareness make better employees. An online training system seemed to be the best way to do this.\" Online diversity training will be discussed at a workshop at the Leadership Foundation's staff development conference in Glasgow this week.</p> <p>Along with a few dozen universities and colleges, Harper Adams is investigating the potential of e-learning as a tool to educate students about diversity. Harper Adams is about to join 15 other institutions to buy a web-based training module from e-learning consultancy Marshall ACM, which supplies diversity training to staff at a number of universities, county councils and primary healthcare trusts.</p> <p>\"Students are often given a lot of responsibility at a very early age,\" says David Marshall, director of Marshall ACM. \"For example, you might find a 21-year-old student warder in charge of a hall of 18-year-olds. Students in these situations do not always realise they have legal responsibilities when it comes to bullying and harassment. Even a minor situation could escalate into a scenario that has legal consequences for the university.\"</p> <p>For Brunel University in Middlesex, the main attraction of web-based diversity training was the ability to train large numbers of students quickly and cheaply using the university's existing e-learning infrastructure.</p> <p>\"We wanted to make sure that we fulfilled our obligations under the Race Relations Act to eliminate discrimination and promote good relations,\" explains Kate Smith from the university's learning and teaching development unit. \"However, it would have been very difficult to provide face-to-face training for all our 13,000 students. We already use virtual learning at all of the seven schools in the university, so we chose to deliver diversity training using the same virtual learning environment.\"</p> <p>Brunel is one of the first universities actively to roll out diversity training to students. As a second stage, the university is hoping to incorporate diversity training into the mainstream syllabus. \"We are looking at ways to reflect diversity throughout the curriculum,\" says Smith. \"We want to provide opportunities for students to develop intercultural awareness, rather than simply teaching students about other cultures.\"</p> <p>But isn't there a risk that increasing awareness of discrimination and harassment on campus will lead to an increase in lawsuits against universities? Marshall doesn't think so. \"Some people are concerned that this kind of training may contribute to a more litigious society,\" he says. \"But all we are doing is informing people of their rights. It is the organisations that don't offer training who are having problems at employment tribunals.\"</p> <p>Universities in the US have been training students in diversity since the 1980s. According to a recent study by the Association of American Colleges and Universities, more than 63% of American higher education institutions offer diversity workshops or courses of academic study that focus on diversity issues. The result is a growing awareness of the benefits of diversity on campus, claims Caryn McTighe Musil, senior vice-president of the AAC&amp;U. \"Diversity is now seen as being integral to excellence, rather than being in opposition to it,\" she says.</p> <p>Discrimination is an increasingly complex issue in the education sector. Many universities are facing accusations of discrimination in favour of students from state schools, after decades of preferential treatment in the opposite direction. With growing numbers of international students at British universities, racial discrimination is no longer simply a case of black v white. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act requires universities to promote good relations between all ethnic groups on campus.</p> <p>In partnership with the National Union of Students, the Union of Students in Ireland has developed into a major provider of diversity training. More than 12,000 students and university staff have been trained by the union since 1994. Thus far, the attention has focused on students who are studying to become teachers or social workers, but the University of Ulster recently extended diversity training to student union sabbatical officers, with plans to provide diversity training to the general student body from 2005.</p> <p>\"Sectarianism is one problem in Northern Ireland,\" says Anne Monaghan, community relations manager at the university. \"But we also have more and more students coming to us from diverse backgrounds, including international students. We don't see our role at the university as just being educational. We also feel we have a social and civic responsibility to promote good community relations and citizenship values.\"</p>",
  "<p>The 10th anniversary of the National Lottery this week has been overshadowed by the furore over imminent changes to the gambling laws in the UK. The government proposes allowing, among other things, greater adult access to casinos, but this has prompted warnings from some MPs and the media of the social dangers - such as addiction and debt - of relaxing the rules.</p> <p>As in cabinet and parliament, so in the classroom: the lottery and gambling are ripe for discussion. They are subjects that raise questions concerning students' attitudes to gaming and the role politicians should play when seeking to safeguard people from their vices.</p> <p><strong>What is gambling?</strong><br></p> <p>Ask students to come up with their own definitions of gambling. To what extent are they exposed to gambling temptations - for example, by getting texts or spam advertising from online gambling sites? Do they regard the lottery or playing on fruit machines as gambling?</p> <p>What do students think about the lottery? Do they feel it is harmless fun or that the benefits outweigh any dangers associated with gambling? Do students feel the immediate gratification of scratch cards is more dangerous than the lottery itself? And what broader effect do they feel the lottery may have had on people's attitudes?</p> <p>These questions could become part of a broader, student-created questionnaire, which could be developed in class and then used to question others in school or an adult at home, forming the basis of a report.</p> <p><strong>What would they do if they won the lottery?</strong><br></p> <p>An old chestnut perhaps, but one that is likely to provoke a lively discussion, particularly if students are given a set of expenditure categories, including their own good causes, to which they must commit their imagined winnings.</p> <p>There are numerous case studies highlighting the benefits and evils of winning; the most recent appear as part of a useful overview of the lottery's first decade in the <a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/focus\">Observer</a>. Students could read these and then see which, if any, of their suggestions are illustrated by these stories.</p> <p><strong>Acceptable or morally sapping?</strong></p> <p>Margaret Thatcher opposed the lottery being set up in the 1980s. She thought it was wrong that people should achieve sudden wealth thanks to a game of chance. Can pupils see any strength in this viewpoint?</p> <p>Is it wrong that so many of us indulge in \"what if I won the lottery\" fantasies? What does it suggest about our lives? Are we all so dissatisfied? And how much money do students think it would it take to be financially secure?</p> <p>The discussion is a useful one for opening up the subject of personal finance, saving and the extent to which pupils' material expectations are often governed by little sense of financial realities (see <a href=\"http://www.pfeg.org\">www.pfeg.org</a>).</p> <p><strong>The changing lottery</strong></p> <p>The lottery has had to evolve over the past 10 years, often in an effort to keep its hold on people's attention. The original game has been supplemented by scratch cards, and online and text versions specifically aimed at people between 18 and 25. Do pupils feel such naked marketing aimed at young people is acceptable? That said, key stage 3 pupils are excluded from buying lottery tickets and perhaps they feel this is unfair.</p> <p>To test pupils' comprehension and data presentation skills, get them to create a timeline, using Guardian Unlimited or the BBC news archives, charting the way in which Camelot, the lottery operator, has tried to keep the public's loyalty over the past decade. What do pupils feel about the present Lady Luck advertisements, for example?</p> <p>Describe the \"hand of fate\" campaign of 10 years ago. Can pupils think why some people were offended by that campaign and still regard the lottery as improper?</p> <p><strong>Lottery - for or against?</strong><br></p> <p>There are lots of other debates surrounding the lottery. One controversy is that the government is increasingly directing how the money should be spent, sending it into areas such as education and health that many feel should be covered by direct taxation (<a href=\"http://www.SocietyGuardian.co.uk/lottery\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk/lottery</a>). There are many other useful articles to help fuel informed classroom discussions.</p> <p>Students could investigate local schemes that have benefited from heritage lottery fund money and present their findings. Do they feel local groups deserved the money? What causes would they give money to instead? There is a regional map dividing up the UK on the organisation's site (<a href=\"http://www.hlf.org.uk \">www.hlf.org.uk</a>).</p> <p><strong>Getting to grips with gambling</strong></p> <p>It is still uncertain what will happen with the proposed reform of gambling laws.</p> <p>Invite students to follow the subject in the news. It has been reported that the minister behind the changes, Tessa Jowell, has suggested that opponents to some of the changes are motivated by \"snobbery\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gambling/\">www.theguardian.com/gambling/</a>).</p> <p>What do pupils understand by that allegation? Are arguments against greater freedom to gamble really saying that working people on low incomes are less able to ignore temptations?</p> <p>Do students think it is a good idea that while gambling may become easier for adults to do, the government is proposing to make it much harder for young people?</p> <p><strong>This lesson is written for key stage 3 (age 11-14) but can be adapted for other ages.</strong></p> <p><strong>Key stage 2 (age 7-11)</strong></p> <p>In the Museum of London, there is a collection of medieval dice that were discovered and excavated near the Thames. X-rays have revealed that each had been filled with mercury, ensuring it would fall on a high or a low number. They can be seen online at <a href=\"http://brickfields.org.uk/index.php/medieval/relics\">http://brickfields.org.uk/index.php/medieval/relics</a>. There must be a story associated with those dice. Invite students to fill in the gaps by contributing to a whole-class story, or through individual efforts. What do you think happened to the \"coney-catcher\" - the trickster who owned these dice?</p> <p>The dice themselves show the deep roots games of chance have in our culture. They provide an opportunity for students to investigate the history of games and games of chance. See, for example, <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/karen_larsdatter/games.htm\">www.geocities.com/karen_larsdatter/games.htm </a>.</p> <p>Gambling is a tricky subject to tackle with younger children, though this does not rule it out. Quiz students about what they think gambling is and what motivates people to gamble. They can then move on to discuss why, for some people, gambling can become an addiction, and what that means.</p> <p>Gamblers Anonymous provides a helpful checklist on its homepage of the key indicators suggesting young people have a problem with gambling. Although number 10, which mentions suicide, may not be suitable, all the others are likely to open up discussions of the possible harmful consequences that might arise if people can't control their gambling (<a href=\"http://www.gamblersanonymous.org.uk/index.htm#top\">www.gamblersanonymous.org.uk/index.htm#top</a>).</p> <p><strong>Key stage 4 (aged 14-16)</strong></p> <p>The proposed changes to the gambling laws have provoked a great deal of lively comment about the dangers of gambling and the degree to which the government should seek to control it. Encourage students to read Victoria Coren's piece about casinos in the Observer, Don't Flutter Yourself (<a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1334782,00.html\">http://observer.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1334782,00.html</a>). They could contrast this with the way casinos are represented in James Bond movies or TV series such as Crime Scene Investigation.</p> <p>For the most able students, there is Roy Hattersley's Guardian article outlining how we should best measure the impact of gambling on society, Gamblers harm other people (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1335176,00.html\">www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1335176,00.html</a>). Invite them to attempt a summary of his arguments.</p> <p>For a more literary approach to the topic, there is no better describer of the terrible fever of gambling than Dostoyevsky. His 1866 novella The Gambler provides compelling passages for analysis and emulation: see it online at <a href=\"http://dostoyevsky.thefreelibrary.com/Gambler\">http://dostoyevsky.thefreelibrary.com/Gambler</a>.</p> <p>The gambling issue also provides media students with plenty to work on. They could attempt an analysis of current lottery advertising. They could also examine how newspaper coverage may have encouraged the government to scale down its gambling plans.</p> <p>There has been much talk of the \u00a3100,000-\u00a3200,000 that big companies have invested in \"lobbying\" the government over proposed changes in legislation. Students could research this topic and those companies likely to benefit at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gambling\">www.theguardian.com/gambling</a>.</p> <p><strong>Curriculum links</strong><br> <strong>KS2</strong></p> <p><strong>Citizenship</strong> 1a, 2e, 2k <br><strong>English</strong> (En1) 1a-f, 2a-f, 3a-e; (En2) 1a-f, 4a-d, 5a-d <br><strong>RE</strong> Unit 1d, 5b</p> <p><strong>KS3</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Citizenship</strong> 1a, 1d, 1h, 1i, 2a-c, 3a-c <br><strong>English</strong> (En1) 1a-f, 2a-f, 3a-e; (En2) 1a-f, 4a-d, 5a-d <br><strong>PSHE</strong> 2b, 2d, 2f <strong>RE</strong> 8c, 9c</p> <p><strong>KS4</strong><br> <strong>Citizenship</strong> 1a, 1g, 1i, 1j, 2a-c, 3a-c <br><strong>English</strong> (En3) Writing to persuade or explain <strong>PSHE</strong> 2b, 2c, 2e, 2g</p> <p><strong>Scottish Curriculum 5-14</strong><br></p> <p><br><strong>Environmental studies</strong> Levels D-F <br><strong>English language</strong> Levels D-F <strong>Resources on learnpremium.co.uk</strong></p> <p>Students can find out more about the lottery and the proposed changes to the gambling laws on <a href=\"http://www.learnpremium.co.uk\">learnpremium.co.uk</a>, the Guardian's subscription-based schools resources website.

But this is no male bonding session. It's depressing watching horse-racing on the television with the curtains closed. Then, one Saturday, a gun-toting girl dressed in biker gear bursts into the house and takes them hostage. The house is soon surrounded by police.</p> <p>Indoors, the middle two generations attempt to use the emergency to their own advantage, counting on the girl's desperation to ensure they won't emerge from the scene unrewarded. Finbar observes their manipulations with growing contempt, but even his betrayal can't stop their conniving. His subsequent discovery that the girl is no more principled than anybody else triggers a brave attempt at redemption. But even in that moment, he remains enmeshed with the past and as corrupt as the men he so despises.</p> <p>This is rigorously intense writing, narrated through Finbar, whose perception of events tumbles from revelation to revelation. It's exactly the kind of fiction that will entice less robust readers to venture forth, and Martyn Pig, by the same author, would be an excellent next step.</p> <p><strong>The CD-rom</strong></p> <p><strong>Poetry &amp; Motion: Pre-1914 Poetry</strong><br> Film Education <br><strong>Price</strong> \u00a335.99 inc VAT for a multi-user licence<br> <strong>Age</strong> 15-16</p> <p>This CD-rom allows students to respond to four pre-1914 poems by creating multimedia presentations in the self-contained editing suite, comprising moving image, sound, music and narration.

  "<p>Two new developments will be making a big impact on the school over the next few years. The first is the Tomlinson reform of the examination system; the second, the government's new legislation on gambling. Since exams are a bit of a lottery anyway, I propose that we combine the two.</p> <p>Tomlinson's four-stage diplomas, Entry, Foundation, Intermediate and Advanced, will not fully cover the whole range in this school, so we shall be introducing three new levels below the Entry grade. In diminishing order, these will be: Rock Bottom, Subterranean and Woodhead.</p> <p>Teachers will be responsible for grading pupils' work, so this gives us a good opportunity to capitalise on the newly relaxed gambling laws. I have installed a large fruit machine, specially purchased from Las Vegas, in the entrance hall. At the end of the year all pupils will have a turn on it to determine their grade: three oranges for an A, one lemon for an ungraded mark.</p> <p>Pupils who are unhappy with my new system can go to our new betting shop (formerly modern languages room) and place a bet on the result of the fruit machine. Smart pupils will bet on a low grade and thus, if they have an unlucky pull of the handle, win a higher grade at the betting shop. Anyone not bright enough to spot this opportunity deserves a low grade anyway.</p> <p>I can see the government adopting yet another of my proposals, as this one will improve standards, raise money and reduce teachers' workloads - happiness all round. It will also help with discipline. Anyone misbehaving should be threatened with a Rock Bottom or Subterranean diploma.</p> <p>If they are being really silly, tell them they will be getting a Woodhead and that will soon bring them into line.</p> <p><strong>Ivan Initiative, headteacher</strong></p>",
  "<b> Dead voters could swing poll</b> <br> <p>A handful of voters in this year's US election belong to a constituency that neither George Bush nor John Kerry have made much effort to reach: the dead. What sounds like a textbook case of voter fraud is in fact a completely legal result of the early voting procedures introduced in many states, though laws about counting dead voters vary across the country. </p> <p>In Florida, government analysts estimated that, based on mortality rates and early voting figures, at least 20 people would have died since casting a vote. The number is likely to be relatively high in Florida, with its sizeable population of elderly people, and will probably be magnified by the popularity of early voting among senior citizens. With the election so finely balanced, deceased early voters could yet swing the election, without the arduous duty of having to stick around for the legal disputes.<br>Oliver Burkeman in Miami </p> <p><b> Parties for US expatriates</b><br> </p> <p>Expatriate Americans in Britain can watch tonight's results at a number of parties.

  "Nerina Shute, who began writing about films in the 1930s along with fellow reviewers Graham Greene and John Betjeman, and who, some 60 years later, rounded off her literary career with a frank memoir about her bisexuality, has died aged 96. <p>Shute, who was the last survivor of a celebrated coterie of film critics of the 1930s, was celebrated also for her openness about her sexuality: she was predominantly lesbian, but married twice. </p> <p>In 1930, when she was 22, she shocked many by a novel which contained what she archly called an \"ambisex-trous\" woman character, while at 84 she wrote a memoir, Passionate Friendships, in which she was candid about her many love affairs. </p> <p>Shute was born in Prudhoe, Northumberland. Her father, Cameron Shute, was the ne'er-do-well son of a general, Sir Charles Shute, who had fought at Balaclava and was MP for Brighton from 1874 to 1880. Her racy mother, n\u00e9e Amy Bertha (\"Renie\") Pepper Stavely, was of a well-to-do family with its seat at Woldhurstlea, near Crawley. </p> <p>Shute's mother had six husbands in all: Cameron Shute was the second. She wrote a scandalous novel, The Unconscious Bigamist. When Nerina was 12, her mother took her to live in Hollywood, to try to get the novel filmed. She left Nerina's baby brother, Charles, in the care of his godmother, Kathleen Cross, a wealthy but austere spinster. He was sent to Eton and was later professor of histology at Cambridge. \"My brother had little love as a child, but a good education,\" she once said, \"I had plenty of love but little education.\" </p> <p>In America, Renie bigamously married a chancer, Captain Mallaby, who bought a goldmine. When Cameron Shute came out to California to investigate the scandal, he and his wife lost most of their inheritance in the mine. </p> <p>Nerina was lonely in Hollywood. At 18 she returned to England on her own. She became a typist at the Times Book Club, then studio correspondent of Film Weekly. Her best friend at this time was the playwright Aim\u00e9e Stuart, with whom she \"talked endlessly about free love and homosexuality\". </p> <p>In 1930 her first novel, Another Man's Poison, was published. Much of it was based on her mother's adventurous life. Rebecca West wrote in the Daily Telegraph, \"Miss Shute writes not so much badly as barbarously ... Yet she is full of talent.\" As a result, Shute was asked to write for the Sunday Graphic, in which she was billed as \"The Girl with the Barbarous Touch\". This in turn led to a meeting with Lord Beaverbrook, owner of the Daily Express, who asked if she was a virgin; quizzed her about sex-life in London; was not shocked by her views on homosexuality; pressed \u00a35 into her hand and told her, \"You know, you are a beautiful woman. But few men will realise it.\" </p> <p>He offered her a job as a reporter on the Express, but on her own admission she was \"useless\" in that role, and was sacked after six months. </p> <p>In an attempt to escape from her homosexuality, she took up with a doctor, \"Charles,\" who had been struck off the medical register for conducting illegal abortions. They lived in Liverpool. Shute bought herself a \"wedding ring\" at Woolworth's. Deluded relatives showered her with wedding presents. (Charles told her: \"You have brought respectability on yourself.\") Charles taught her about poetry, politics and sex; but there were too many quarrels, and after six months she returned to her old life in London. </p> <p>She applied to be film critic of the Sunday Referee, telling the editor, Mark Goulden, \"I'm down and out, but I used to be a damn good journalist.\" He took her on at \u00a35 a week. She was then the youngest film critic in Fleet Street. </p> <p>Shute recalled the screenings and the socialising with John Betjeman when we became friends following a chance meeting I had with her in 1989, when I explained that I was working on a biography of the former poet laureate. Like Betjeman, she was no cineaste, but knew how to hit off an actor in a deft, often slightly malicious, phrase. After three years, she was fired, because she had offended the Gaumont British group, which owned the Sunday Referee. </p> <p>By now she was the lover of \"Josephine,\" a monocle-wearing Roman Catholic who assured her, \"There is nothing in the Bible against lesbians.\" Their affair ended in 1936 when Shute married James Wentworth Day, a Tory journalist. With this \"ugly man of considerable charm\" she lived in a panelled house in King Street, St James's, went duck-shooting and fox-hunting. But the marriage lasted only a year. </p> <p>In the summer of 1937, she had a play performed at Kew Theatre, but it did not reach the West End. She began living with two women, \"Helen\" and \"Andy,\" respectively a gynaecologist and a dental surgeon. The war came. In a radio broadcast of 1940, she met Howard Marshall, a broadcaster known as \"the voice of England\" for his cosy chats on cricket and other subjects. In 1944, when Marshall, divorced, was home on leave after covering the D-Day landings, they married. </p> <p>In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Shute published three historical novels, based on Fanny Burney, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Percy Bysshe Shelley. </p> <p>She loved - and continued to love - Howard Marshall, though the marriage ended after she confessed to him, during a row on New Year's Eve, 1953, that she was having an affair with their French maid. </p> <p>Shute's mother was now on her sixth husband, No\u00ebl Sparrow. To try to distract him from his alcoholism, Shute took him to ballroom dancing lessons. The instructor was Phyllis Haylor, a strikingly good-looking dancing champion. She became the great love of Shute's life. The two women lived near each other in London and took a holiday cottage together. </p> <p>Haylor died in 1981, aged 77. In 1989, Shute was introduced by a friend to the artist Jocelyn Williams who became her lover and, as Shute's long life neared its end, her devoted carer. </p> <p>Shute's books include a memoir of her mother, Come Into The Sunlight (1957) and a history of the relationship between the Royal Family and the Spencers (published in 1986), just before the greatest crisis in that relationship. </p> <p>As a young woman she had been an ardent socialist. In the years I knew her, she seemed more like a \"refained\" gentlewoman out of an Ealing film, a fervent Conservative. She was such an unwavering defender of Mrs Thatcher that friends wondered if, perhaps, she had a slight crush on her. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Nerina Shute, writer, born July 17 1908; died October 20 2004</p>",
  "<p>Pierce Brosnan, the actor who has played James Bond in the last four 007 films, says he thinks fellow Irishman Colin Farrell would be his ideal successor.</p> <p>Brosnan, 51, said several actors could ably fill his shoes in the coveted role, which he took on in 1995 with GoldenEye and was last seen as in 2002's Die Another Day.</p> <p>\"But I'll give it to Colin Farrell.

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>SLEEPLESS IN MILWAUKEE (NOT TO MENTION BRITAIN)</b></p> <p>The tension is growing almost unbearable. When George Bush and John Kerry held neighbouring rallies in Milwaukee yesterday, says Simon Jenkins, it was like \"Hector and Achilles finally meeting under the gates of Troy\". You'll recall that Achilles killed Hector before being killed by Paris's arrow. Make of that what you will.</p> <p>On election day, the broadsheets have turned to what unites Americans rather than what divides them. The Guardian's Gary Younge, who has driven from Mr Kerry's home town, Boston, to Mr Bush's, Midland in Texas, says the two towns \"could be in two entirely different nations\". Yet \"one of the few things that has remained constant while on the road has been the ubiquity of the stars and stripes. The national flag billows everywhere. ... But these demonstrations of patriotism offer little or no suggestion of which side of the political divide people are on. You are as likely to find them among Republicans as Democrats.\" </p> <p>\"The notorious political polarisation in the United States is something of an illusion,\" writes the Telegraph's Niall Ferguson in San Francisco. \"What we are seeing here is a sign of democratic vitality in a land that remains fundamentally whole.\"</p> <p>The pollster John Zogby confirmed the intensity of feeling. \"Among young voters between the ages of 18 and 29,\" he tells the Guardian, \"zero said they were undecided. That suggests a very high level of interest among people who historically were not that engaged - young African-American males, for example.\"</p> <p>The candidates are exhausted. But the Herald Tribune says Mr Kerry \"lightened up\" as the day of judgment approached. \"There is a calm confidence about him in these closing days.\" Mr Bush's \"playful optimism\" betrays no sign of tension, though he is \"greyer\" than he was on September 11 and is \"showing some wear and tear\".</p> <p>The FT lines up David Frum (\"[Bush] fights\") against Douglas Brinkley (\"Do not expect Mr Kerry to capitulate or roll over like Al Gore did\"); the Independent pitches Kerry campaigner George Soros against Matthew Hoffmann (\"Bin Laden has made it clear that his candidate for US president is John Kerry\").</p> <p>Also in the pro-Bush camp is Michael Gove of the Times - \"There's no denying that Hamlet is the more interesting guy. But there's a reason Fortinbras commands the stage at the end of the play ... It's one word.

  "Several hundred thousand taxpayers will have missed rebates or avoided extra tax bills because staff have accidentally deleted their records from Inland Revenue files, it was disclosed yesterday. <p>The error was covered up by the Inland Revenue for nine months before it admitted the mistake to the National Audit Office (NAO) just before it was due to report to parliament. It affects some of the many people who pay tax through pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) but are either owed rebates or need to pay additional tax. </p> <p>Richard Bacon, the Conservative MP for South Norfolk and a member of the Commons public accounts committee, yesterday won an inquiry into the affair. He told Sir John Bourn, the auditor general, in a letter: \"Since the revenue holds over 30m records, this issue could easily affect many hundreds of thousands of taxpayers.\" </p> <p>The NAO found that the revenue first noticed in the autumn of 2003 that a \"well-established and accepted housekeeping routine\" on the PAYE computer databases had been deleting records before they had been reviewed to check whether there had been any under or overpayment of tax. The practice had gone on undetected for a number of years. </p> <p>The revenue did not tell the auditors until July this year. </p> <p>\"The main groups of people who would be affected are pregnant women who left employment and did not return to work, summer students, people who left the country, people sent to prison and people who have since died,\" the Inland Revenue said yesterday. </p> <p>In his letter to Sir John, Mr Bacon said: \"It is odd that the revenue should not have a system that would enable it to keep track of all its core data.\" </p> <p>An Inland Revenue spokeswoman said the result of an internal inquiry into the problem was expected within a few weeks. The NAO said yesterday it was examining how the Inland Revenue handled the blunder and would report to MPs by the end of the year.</p>",
  "<p>So, there I was in the Arctic Circle clad in only a thin silk blouse. The National Teaching Awards was one hell of a day, and I will admit to being significantly over-refreshed and slightly overwrought at the end of it. I woke, at 6am, gazing at the underside of a chair, by the side of a still-made bed in room 103 of the Tower Thistle hotel. This came as something of a shock, as I had rung my wife at 9pm, saying I would be home within the hour. It was further compounded by the fact that I didn't recognise the underneath of the chair as being such, and gave myself a well deserved knock on the head as I sat up.</p> <p>Things being as they were, I decided a live TV interview at lunchtime was no longer on the list of things to do today.</p> <p>I also felt my slot on the Robert Elms show on BBC London Live would be a little taxing for my delicate nerves; and the media briefing from the organisation I was to be representing for the next year - definitely on my list of things to avoid.</p> <p>I bunged the first things I could find in my bag (fortunately, I didn't have to dress as I had conveniently slept in my suit) and bundled into a cab, racing across Tower Bridge, relieved to escape the circus.</p> <p>It was only on returning home, thankfully, to an understanding, giggling wife, that I realised the possessions I had recovered from the room did not include the award I had just received. Oh well, easy come, easy go. We received a call from my mum, which was nice; then nothing.</p> <p>I spent all day fairly sure that I had, yet again, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. This was confirmed when I saw Sue Seifert, winner of the lifetime achievement award, on the telly the next morning looking near-divine and pontificating on the moralities of playground language (something about which, as an English teacher and long-term devotee of Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, I know loads).</p> <p>Paul Keogh, last year's winner, had been full of compassionate warning about the potential joys and perils of the year ahead, and I had honestly expected either to be in super trouble with the Teaching Awards Trust - \"a new kind of police force\" - or, as Paul suggested, to have the phone ringing off the wall.</p> <p>Neither happened. The first two days in my year as the poster boy of inner-city education were spent, much as the previous seven years have been ... trawling the world wide web forlornly, looking for mentions of my own genius, finding none.</p> <p>Oh well. Never mind.</p> <p>On the third day, I rested, and geared myself up for a bout of half-term decorating. Sophie Byatt from the Teaching Awards Trust rang.</p> <p>\"Ulp! Am I persona non grata, Soph?\"</p> <p>\"No.\"</p> <p>\" 'Cause I thought I'd...\"</p> <p>\"It was a party. It wasn't a school night. I was up 'til two myself. We've found your award. I'll get it biked over along with your laptop.\"</p> <p>\"Laptop?\"</p> <p>\"Yes. We gave them out at the media briefing - which you, erm, missed.\"</p> <p>I was not, thank God, in super-trouble. Sophie was so nice that my brow unfurrowed for the first time in three days. The award arrived, along with a top of the range RM laptop, and now sits, out of reach of the children, alongside my \"Beckenham Social FC: Players' Player of the Year - 1984\" trophy.</p> <p>It came with a media briefing sheet. This suggested that I could be the object of some professional jealousy when I get back to school.</p> <p>I don't expect this one little bit. Since we, the school, found out about the award, on the Thursday before the ceremony, every single one of my colleagues has offered the heartiest of congratulations and the warmest of handshakes.</p> <p>Eastlea, my school in Canning Town, east London, is a large, and functional, family. When one of us does well - student or teacher - we're happy.</p> <p>And this has been, for me, the defining characteristic of receiving the award. Everyone I have met has been just unbelievably - and I mean just the right side of cloying - nice. I had the pleasure of speaking to two of the regional winners from my category, Dick Jones from Dyson Perrins school in Malvern and Lynne Coy from Yewlands in Sheffield (real teachers, 30-year professionals, both, to my mind more deserving of an award than an arriviste such as myself). They were grace personified. Dick left me a lovely message on the Teaching Awards website; Lynne almost made me cry when she said she was glad \"a real teacher\" had won it. So, no I don't expect any jealousy. I don't think horrid people go into teaching.</p> <p>There are worries, however. Talking to Paul Keogh was salutary. For a start, he seems to have conducted himself throughout this year with a solidity and personal integrity which I'm not sure I possess. He is obviously a serious guy, capable of a level of studied professionalism which even my closest friends would say was utterly beyond me. Also, Paul's wife, Julie, whom I met in the green room, is a teacher.</p> <p>They seemed to have worked very much in tandem over the year. My wife is not a teacher. She is, moreover, a tousle-haired hippy: contemptuous of ambition, gleefully satirical of me, and in possession of a tiny, seven-week-old ginger boy permanently clamped to her left bosom. (Hippies have to resort to strange modes of employment these days.) She spurns green rooms as if they were plague-houses, and has the kind of respect for transient mini-micro-celebrity I'd always wanted in a wife.</p> <p>I'm also a bit worried about being photographed. If this had happened when I was a vain little sod with tight skin and tighter trousers, this aspect of it would have been a joy. But I'm 40 next year, have three small boys, and the paper-round I took when an NQT has taken a heavy toll. Seeing myself on the telly was an event almost as traumatic as being born, and I was breech.</p> <p>All-in-all, though, I will admit to being delighted. Trepidatious, sure, but trepidatious with a big, fat, cheesy grin attached. I am not sure what the Teaching Awards mean, whether I deserve one, or whether I fluked a couple of fancy-dan lessons, but I am bloody glad to be a recipient. The school gets a new minibus, Abdi and Rashid got to be on telly, I get a fancy laptop and a handsome title, and my class control, hopefully, gets that much easier.</p> <p>\"Take that out of his ear. I'm teacher of the year.\"</p> <p>The best parts, so far, have been coming off the stage at the Palace Theatre and replying to Lord Attenborough's, \"Well done Phil\" with a brisk and breezy, \"Cheers Dicky!\". I then found myself in the same room as both Imogen Stubbs and a glass of champagne, thereby fulfilling a much cherished and oft-repeated dream from my youth, which, as I recall featured a much smaller room; and fewer people.</p> <p>All this was trumped, however, by a message from Daniel Acheampong. A fine young man, whom it had been my pleasure to guide and mentor through the last three of his years at Eastlea. \"Let me just say thanks for being a fantastic form tutor to me and all of 11S ex-students 2004.\"</p> <p>I'm going to need two seats on the Docklands Light Railway this week - one for me, and one for my ego - and I may yet have a tracksuit made with Teacher of the Year in gold lettering on the back.</p>",
  "<p>Radio measurement body Rajar will today attempt to persuade a judge to strike out a lawsuit from Kelvin MacKenzie's Wireless Group that argues its audience has been undervalued in audience surveys.</p> <p>Legal teams for the two sides will square up over two days in the high court in London to decide whether the claim can be brought to trial next year.</p> <p>Rajar is aiming to show it has not breached competition law after refusing to adopt more quickly the electronic measurement system favoured by Mr MacKenzie.</p> <p>The Wireless Group will argue it has lost business because its audience has been inaccurately measured by Rajar's diary system, in which 30,000 people write down which radio stations they have listened to each day for three months. </p> <p>The company claims the number of people who tune in to its flagship TalkSport station is more than three times greater than Rajar figures suggest, and that it is losing out on advertising revenues as a result.</p> <p>For the past year and a half the Wireless Group has been publishing statistics based on figures from research group Gfk. These figures, based on Gfk's electronic wristwatch measurement system, record higher audience numbers for speech-based stations such as TalkSport.</p> <p>Some observers have pointed out that GfK relies on a smaller sample and includes as listeners people who have been tuning in for less time than the Rajar system stipulates.</p> <p>The present system is based on \"recall\" - what listeners remember tuning into - while the GfK method focuses on audience exposure, often for brief periods, to a particular frequency.</p> <p>Mr MacKenzie has promised \"shocking revelations\" about the way Rajar conducted tests that led to its decision last year not to adopt the new technology. </p> <p>Rajar has since announced plans to go electronic by 2007 and is conducting trials later this month on three potential devices, including the GfK wristwatch.</p> <p>It believes it should not rush to adopt a new system that would cost the radio industry more money and might not be reliable.</p> <p>The row has been brewing for more than four years, and came to a head in March when Mr MacKenzie, the former editor of the Sun, acted on his longstanding threat to take Rajar to court.</p> <p>His company is claiming to have lost \u00a366m in revenues since it first raised the issue of measurement with Rajar in August 2000, although no formal claim for such an amount has been submitted.</p> <p>This week's hearing is expected to last until tomorrow, though the judge may reserve his judgment for a couple of weeks.</p> <p>If he decides to let the case go to trial, it is likely to be heard early in next summer.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "At least 20 members of the Metropolitan police's elite firearms unit are refusing to carry their weapons in protest at the suspension of two colleagues over the death of a man carrying a table leg which they mistook for a shotgun. <p>A further 100 members of the SO19 unit, the Metropolitan police's specialist armed response service, have said they want to temporarily withdraw themselves from firearms duty after Scotland Yard suspended Inspector Neil Sharman and PC Kevin Fagan. </p> <p>The pair could face criminal charges after a second inquest into the death of Harry Stanley last week returned a verdict of unlawful killing five years after his death. </p> <p>The prospect of a quarter of the officers in SO19 striking over the case has led to two crisis meetings in the 400-strong unit. SO19 sources said those who do withdraw will still turn up for work to perform other duties but will not carry weapons. </p> <p>\"More than 100 have now indicated they are not prepared to carry on at the moment until they review their position,\" said a source. \"They are bitterly disappointed at the way the two officers have been treated and they feel unsupported.\" </p> <p>At the inquest, which ended last Friday, the Stanley family argued that the two firearms officers were not truthful in their account of what happened when they challenged the 46-year-old in September 1999 near his east London home. The jury rejected the two officers' claim they believed Stanley posed an imminent threat to their lives when they shot him. </p> <p>A spokesman for Scotland Yard last night insisted the strike action had not affected the Met's armed coverage of the capital and said that SO19 officers were all volunteers and could stand down whenever they wished. </p> <p>\"It is only to be expected that firearms officers, who carry out some of the most dangerous and demanding of policing duties, should now feel especially vulnerable,\" he said. \"We are doing our utmost to provide support and reassurance to these officers and are listening carefully to the issues they raise.\" </p> <p>Glen Smyth, the chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said the suspension of the two officers had provoked \"anger and disquiet\" among their colleagues. \"All firearms officers are now asking them selves if they, too, will be abandoned by the Met should they have the misfortune to find themselves in similar circumstances to those officers who are currently suspended, even if they were to act fully in accordance with their training,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Their current action is, they feel, the only way they can make their voice heard.\" </p> <p>The armed officers, one of whom has since been promoted, claimed that Stanley reacted to their shouted warn ing of \"Stop! Armed police\" by turning round and raising the object he was carrying upwards, as if about to fire a gun. They had been sent in search of a suspect after a man in a pub where Stanley had been drinking rang police to say an Irishman had left the pub carrying a gun. </p> <p>At the inquest, Tim Owens QC accused the officers of having \"concocted\" their claims that Stanley had turned round fully to face them and had raised the table leg believed by the police to have been a gun as if to fire. The family argued that ballistics evidence showed that the officers' account could not be true, a claim ultimately believed by the inquest jury. </p> <p>Daniel Machover, solicitor for Stanley's family, said: \"Nobody is criticising the two firearms officers for believing it was a gun. </p> <p>\"The key question is when they challenged him what happened. Their account that he posed a threat to their lives was disbelieved by the jury.\"</p>",
  "<p>Scotland Yard launched a photo campaign yesterday to show the physical ravages caused by drug addiction, in an attempt to persuade people to shop dealers. </p> <p>Haunting police mugshots of three American addicts show their decline over a few years, from healthy women to skeletal figures with wizened faces and sunken eyes. </p> <p>The pictures were taken when the women were arrested for drug-related crimes and have been provided by US police departments, which are subject to less stringent confidentiality restrictions than their British counterparts. </p> <p>But the Metropolitan police said there were thousands of addicts with similar stories in the UK. They hope the press, radio, billboard, flyer and beermat advertisements, targeted on 16 drug hotspot boroughs around London, will shock the public into helping to tackle the problem. </p> <p>Drug abuse is behind a huge amount of crime. The Metropolitan police believe addicts commit as many as one in two burglaries and muggings, while shootings and kidnappings are a frequent fallout from dealers' turf wars. </p> <p>Commander Stephen James, head of the Met's drugs directorate, said: \"This is a spiral of destruction with drug dealers providing the poison. Many addicts turn to crime in order to pay for drugs, and that crime can be very violent.\" </p> <p>Those charged with what are termed \"trigger offences\", which include street robberies and burglaries, are now routinely tested for drugs in 17 London boroughs and in several other cities, including Birmingham and Manchester. The government plans to extend the scheme nationwide. </p> <p>Cmdr James said about 50% of those charged with trigger offences were crack cocaine users. </p> <p>Police are working with health agencies and local authorities to ensure that addicts are offered counselling and rehabilitation programmes. </p> <p>The capital is plagued by crack cocaine, with about 45,000 such addicts, according to the Greater London authority's drugs advisory group. Cmdr James said crack was first imported into the UK in 1988-89, and became more \"embedded\" in London, although it had also spread to other regions. </p> <p>Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, head of the Yard's specialist crime directorate, said officers had had considerable success against drugs in recent months. </p> <p>In the last three weeks alone, police have carried out 65 intelligence-led anti-drug operations, arrested 146 people, and seized more than 5kg (11lb) of drugs, as well as cash and counterfeit notes, four guns and 20 knives. </p> <p>Mr Ghaffur said: \"The message of this campaign is: 'Don't let drug dealers destroy the face of your neighbourhood.' There can be no more powerful deterrent than the whole community taking a stance against the drug dealers amongst them.\" </p> <p>The three women featured in the advertisements are Roseanne Holland, from Florida, who was pictured between the ages of 29 and 37; Melissa Collara, also from Florida, who was 18 in the first photo and 21 in the second; and Penny Wood, from Chicago, whose decline is depicted from 36 to 40. </p> <p>Cmdr James said police did not know whether Ms Holland and Ms Collara, who was arrested 17 times for prostitution over three years, were still alive. </p> <p>But Ms Wood, who has been in a rehabilitation programme for 18 months, has written a moving letter to police, backing the campaign. </p> <p>\"This drug is evil ... not only the outer disfiguration is extreme, the effects it has on your insides are worse ... It takes everything I have to walk a flight of stairs. My lungs are destroyed. I have no control over my bladder. My long-term and short-term memories are next to none. I've only been clear a year and a half, so my body and brains are still not complete. I want no pity. </p> <p>\"I just want these young people to know what this stuff does to your insides as well as the outward appearance.\"</p>",
  "<p>Negotiations between football authorities and national newspapers over the use of data and images from Premier League and Football League matches are to go to extra time after the two sides failed to reach an agreement by last night's deadline. </p> <p>The dispute could yet end in court, with both sides refusing to back down in the row over the rights to fixture data, pictures and match reports. In the meantime, the current arrangements are to be extended while negotiations continue. </p> <p>\"The Newspaper Publishers' Association, Premier League and Football League today agreed to continue talks in regard to accreditation for photographers and journalists to cover football matches,\" the parties involved said in a joint statement last night. </p> <p>\"The continued dialogue means that the existing licensing arrangements will remain in place for the time being,\" they added. </p> <p>Several national newspapers, including the Sun and the Mirror, have already ordered a blackout on printing the names of the sponsors associated with the two leagues - Barclays and Coca-Cola - and are using photographs designed to obscure the names of sponsors on players' jerseys. </p> <p>This prompted letters from DataCo, the company representing the data rights of both league bodies, threatening legal action against newspapers for breach of contract. Last week the Guardian also said it would remove the league sponsors from its coverage in protest at DataCo's tactics. </p> <p>It had been speculated that national newspaper reporters and photographers could be barred from matches if the dispute was not settled by last night's deadline. But sources close to the talks between the Newspaper Publishers Association and DataCo said that some progress was being made and that a two-week extension had been agreed. </p> <p>DataCo is concerned that newspapers are profiting from the game through fantasy football competitions, mobile score alerts and downloads. </p> <p>But the papers are refusing to accept a list of demands including provisions that digital publication of match photographs should be subject to a two-hour time delay and that up to 7% of revenues from \"fantasy football\" competitions should be returned to clubs. </p> <p>They fear that giving in to the demands will be the \"thin end of the wedge\" that could lead to increasing control over what they publish and when. DataCo was set up three years ago to handle the data and image rights of the Premier League and Football League. </p> <p>Premier League insiders insist they have no desire to influence newspaper reports and photographs. They argue it has a duty to protect the rights of clubs to exploit and sell the rights to burgeoning internet and mobile services, as well as spin-off products such as posters and sticker albums. </p> <p>The Premier League recently sold the rights to provide \"in game\" mobile goal clips and updates for the next three seasons to 3 and Vodafone in a \u00a330m deal and new media rights to BSkyB for a further \u00a320m. </p> <p>Although a full press ban is unlikely, if no agreement is reached the row will end in court. DataCo will demand that reporters and photographers inside football grounds sign a new accreditation agreement. </p> <p>If they refuse and publish images and score alerts deemed to be in contravention of the new rules, the football authorities have vowed to take them to court. </p> <p>The current licensing deal between the Newspaper Publishers Association and the football authorities came to an end at the close of last season, with an extension originally agreed until the end of October when the two sides failed to come to an agreement. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "John Kerry's quest for the White House, a journey he began 45 years ago as an earnest teenage debate champion, entered its longest day yesterday, with the Democrat racing through six rallies in four states in a last appeal to America. <p>By yesterday afternoon, on a miserable day in Milwaukee, a lifetime of striving was distilled into an instant of clarity. \"This is kind of a magical moment,\" Mr Kerry told an outdoor rally in the centre of town. \"The hopes of the whole nation, and the whole world are on the line.\"</p> <p>The fatigue was evident on Mr Kerry's face and in his voice. He has slept at a different location for each of the last 19 nights and his schedule yesterday, as on many days, stretched to 17 hours. But as he hugged his daughters Alexandra and Vanessa, he looked happy and genuinely touched as a sodden crowd in fluorescent campaign rain ponchos chanted: \"One more day.\"</p> <p>With the clock running down towards today's vote, Mr Kerry's was a day of perpetual motion: from Florida, today's biggest battleground prize, to Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, another large state within the Democrats' reach, and back to Wisconsin.</p> <p>Democratic aides say that Mr Kerry has maintained an inner calm during the last hours of the campaign, occasionally tossing around a football on airport tarmacs, or doing stretching exercises in his seat. By the time he got to Milwaukee, he seemed almost nostalgic about the gruelling itineraries of recent days. \"You guys look so wonderful, wet and bundled and huddled up,\" he told the crowd, promising to remember Milwaukee no matter what happened.</p> <p>Although the latest opinion polls gave the Democrats no cause for confidence - demonstrating yet again that today's contest is a virtual tie - Mr Kerry, they say, betrays little sign of tension. But they also admit that he has taken to switching off the television when new poll numbers pop up.</p> <p>However, they say that this is a man who is focused on the completion of a mission that has consumed his entire life. Mr Kerry's presidential ambitions took root with his teenage infatuation with the late John F Kennedy, and was never extinguished even after losing his first election for Congress in the 1970s, and a disastrous early start in the Democratic primaries.</p> <p>A year ago, he was forced to mortgage his home in Boston to continue what then seemed a doomed campaign for the Democratic leadership. By last night, he had burned through an election season that was the most gruelling and expensive in history. But he seemed, at last, resigned to his fate - as did his supporters. \"All I can do is go out and vote. The rest is out of my control,\" said David Ollinger, a bass player and hunting enthusiast.</p> <p>While Mr Kerry's strategy has focused on wresting Florida and Ohio from Mr Bush, he has also had to protect his own turf, warding off Republican designs on Michigan and Wisconsin. He has his work cut out for him in Wisconsin, a fact he acknowledged by returning to the state to spend the night there last night. Al Gore eked out a bare bones victory in the 2000 elections, taking it by just 5,700 votes, and Mr Kerry is struggling against increasing conservatism in rural parts of the state.</p> <p>His supporters were there for him in Milwaukee yesterday. \"We earnestly want to see George Bush displaced. He has just been so bad,\" said Jeri Waldman, who dragged her family out in the rain. Now, Mr Kerry needs them to be out for him again today.</p>",
  "The Home Office was accused of \"seriously misleading\" the courts by a leading QC yesterday, after its lawyers disclosed dramatic new evidence on the eve of the last day of a seven-day House of Lords hearing. <p>The hearing by the law lords is the culmination of a three-year legal battle over an operation at Prague airport. UK immigration officers stationed there were authorised to refuse entry clearance before planes were boarded, instead of waiting until a would-be entrant arrived in the UK. </p> <p>The evidence, served on lawyers for the European Roma Rights Centre at their homes as they slept late on Saturday night or early Sunday morning, appears to contradict that given by Home Office officials earlier in the case. </p> <p>Lawyers said yesterday that they had never seen new evidence being produced at such a late stage in the Lords. </p> <p>Lord Lester QC, for the rights centre, said the witness statements served at the weekend made it clear that evidence put before the original high court hearing by the Home Office \"was not merely incomplete, as they now acknowledge, but was in fact seriously misleading\". </p> <p>Lawyers for the rights centre, briefed by the human rights group Liberty, argue that the pre-clearance operation worked in a discriminatory way against Czech Roma. </p> <p>An amendment to the Race Relations Act in 2000 allowed the home secretary to issue authorisations for discrimination in the exercise of immigration functions. An authorisation in May 2001 allowed discrimination against various ethnic groups, including Roma. </p> <p>But the government has always maintained that the authorisation did not apply to the operation at Prague airport. Its case has always been that the operation was not carried out in a discriminatory manner, although statistics show that Roma were 400 times as likely to be turned away as non-Roma Czechs. </p> <p>A home office official, James Munro, said in a witness statement produced for the original high court hearing that immigration officers did not rely on the discrimination authorisation as a \"routine norm\". Non-discrimination was the \"baseline\", and the authorisation was a \"strategic exception\" requiring special instruction. </p> <p>A witness statement from another civil servant, Tim Woodhouse, said that \"although it was impossible to exclude the possibility that the authorisation had ever been relied on, IND [the immigration and nationality directorate] could not demonstrate any recorded use of the authorisation.\" </p> <p>But the documents produced to the law lords yesterday - extracts from the instructions to immigration officers and slides from their training programme - make it clear that they were told unequivocally that from May 1 2001 they were allowed to discriminate on grounds of ethnic or national origin when dealing with the groups listed. </p> <p>The document lists the various forms of discrimination authorised, including more rigorous questioning. One slide says staff \"need to be familiar with the content of the list of groups authorised\". Another warns against staff choosing to \"disengage by not subjecting certain people/groups to extra scrutiny where appropriate.\" </p> <p>Mr Munro says in his latest witness statement, handed to the law lords yesterday: \"There was no intention to conceal or mislead, and I apologise.\" </p> <p>Barry Hugill of Liberty said: \"This new evidence fundamentally undermines everything that the government has argued ... This case has gone on for three years at huge expense to the taxpayer.\" </p> <p>The Home Office said: \"We maintain that our pre-clearance arrangements have been operated on a non-discriminatory basis.\"</p>",
  "Frank Dobson, the former health secretary, issued the government with a stern warning yesterday that its gambling bill would be \"bad for the country, bad for families, and bad for the Labour party.\" <p>In a characteristically robust attack, Mr Dobson said there was no public demand for super-casinos and the bill represented the \"worst possible political combination - it is both wrong and unpopular.\" </p> <p>\"We appear to be changing the law for the sake of some casino companies to make it easier for them to tempt hard-working British families to lose their money so that they can make profits\" he added. </p> <p>The former cabinet minister, who led backbench criticism as MPs debated the bill for the first time in the Commons, went on to suggest that the bill would offer \"extra temptations\", with the end of a 24-hour \"cooling-off period\"; the massive numbers of slot machines available; and the new \u00a31m jackpots increasing levels of gambling. </p> <p>His concerns were reflected by senior Labour backbenchers in a volley of hostile interventions as the culture secretary <b>Tessa Jowell</b> outlined the bill's measures in a speech intended to calm fears over the legislation. </p> <p><b>Donald Anderson</b>, Labour chairman of the foreign affairs committee, attacked her claim that the popularity of bingo suggested an appetite for gambling. \"Don't you see the world of difference between ordinary folks who want to go to bingo halls and the proliferation of mega-casinos?\" he asked. \"Why can't you have a few pilots so you can test your own views against what will happen in the real world?\" </p> <p>Ms Jowell denied there would be a \"proliferation\" of new casinos. </p> <p><b>Geraldine Smith</b>, MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, warned it would be the \"nanny state gone mad\" if parents were prosecuted for letting a child to go into a seaside amusement arcade and \"roll a 10p piece down a chute to win a cuddly toy\". </p> <p>The former Labour sports minister <b>Kate Hoey</b> said the government would prevent all opposition if it removed its plans for mega casinos. She asked if the bill as drafted had been included in the party's last manifesto. </p> <p>Ms Jowell told her: \"We certainly undertook in the Queen's speech to publish a draft gambling bill.\" To jeers, she added: \"I can't recall whether they [the proposals] were in the manifesto because work on developing them started in the last parliament ...\" </p> <p><b>Joan Humble</b>, Labour MP for Blackpool North and Fleetwood, welcomed the majority of the bill but said she had \"very genuine concerns about proliferation\" of super-casinos: \"I do have to ask why she expects there will be only 20-40 and where she expects them to be?\" </p> <p>The super-casinos were \"large complexes offering 24-hour entertainment\", which would have far more of an effect on towns than projects such as swimming pools, and she questioned whether the regional planning organisations would be sufficiently powerful. </p> <p><b>Gordon Prentice</b>, Labour MP for Pendle, said there was no reliable evidence of the impact of unlimited prize machines and there was \"a classic case for having some new pilot casinos\", while <b>Rob Marris</b>, MP for Wolverhampton South West, questioned why, if research indicated there would be no more than 40 large casinos, Ms Jowell was not prepared to introduce a cap on numbers - a call reiterated by the Conservative <b>John Bercow</b>. </p> <p>Labour's <b>Win Griffiths</b>, a Methodist, said he was likely to vote against the bill as he warned: \"These proposals are going to result in more people getting into gambling problems,\" while fellow Welsh MP <b>Simon Thomas</b>, for Plaid Cymru, said too little had been said about gambling's \"real harm to society\" and the fact it was founded in \"misery and broken dreams.\" </p> <p>It said little about the government if its plans for regeneration were based on gambling, he added. </p> <p>For the Tories, shadow culture secretary <b>John Whittingdale</b> accused the government of being \"seduced by the prospect of millions of pounds of investment by overseas operators who want to come and set up in this country\". But such companies were not motivated by altruism, he added. </p> <p>With his party intending to vote against the bill, he warned: \"At the moment the bill is fatally flawed in several respects and there is a real danger it is going to lead to an increase in gambling addiction and is going to fail to provide the protection to the vulnerable and children that the government claims.\" </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' culture spokesman <b>Don Foster</b> also said his party would oppose the bill because it did not control the introduction of super-casinos, did not give local authorities enough powers to oppose them and did not limit the introduction of category A gaming machines - which have unlimited stakes and prizes. Even if such machines only made up 10% of those as planned, there would be 5,000, he warned.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Scotsman </strong><br> Editorial, November 1 </p> <p> \"If ever a piece of legislation deserved the most thorough scrutiny, it is the gambling bill - due for its second reading [yesterday] ...

  "If it wasn't such a ghastly bill, you'd have felt sorry for Tessa Jowell. Never send a girl to do a woman's work. Don't entrust a bill that is going to bring in billions for some of the toughest and meanest \"businessmen\" in the world to Fotherington-Thomas's more naive little sister. <p>It was ghastly, horrible and desperately painful to watch. Poor Ms Jowell must have felt like someone hustled into the back seat of a limo, flanked by men in sharkskin suits, genuinely believing she was being invited along on a friendly trip because Vito wanted to see her. </p> <p>Her voice trembling slightly, she began to speak for the second reading. The attacks started as soon as she stood up. Kate Hoey wanted to know if relaxing the gaming laws had even appeared in the Labour manifesto. </p> <p>\"I can't frankly recall,\" she admitted as the booing, the jeering and the grumbling began. The house had spotted a victim. It is not a pretty sight. The late John Gotti, in some ways a fastidious man, would have turned away. </p> <p>(I am not, for one moment, implying that the people who want to set up super-casinos around Britain are the same as the chaps with vowels at the end of their names and improbable income tax returns. But they may have some friends in common.) </p> <p>Then John Gummer wanted to know why she had described the opposition to the bill - from her own backbenchers, the Catholic church and the Salvation Army - as \"snobbish\". </p> <p>At this point she must have realised that the bucketful of wet concrete might be waiting at the end of the trip. </p> <p>\"I did not describe people as snobs, I referred to a 'whiff of snobbery',\" she attempted to explain. The jeering grew louder. It was \"patronising\" to tell people how to spend their money and their leisure time. She became more nervous. \"They would rather that gambling did not take place\" became \"plake tace.\" </p> <p>She tried to imply that we were a nation already addicted to gambling. She was merely trying to save us from ourselves. </p> <p>\"Each year around four million people visit the country's 700 bingo clubs ...\" she announced, as if there was any conceivable comparison, and Julie Kirkbride called out - no, enunciated like Dame Edith Evans in her majestic pomp - \"bingo?\" </p> <p>MPs popped up to intervene like moles in the old arcade game that children are to be banned from playing. She tried to ignore them but in vain. </p> <p>Bob Russell asked how many of her constituents in Dulwich had asked to have a super-casino there. </p> <p>Did she have an answer to that teaser? Don't be daft. </p> <p>\"As of yet, the legislation is not on the statute book,\" she replied primly, as if that meant anything at all. </p> <p>The Speaker had to intervene repeatedly to help her. He was like a cop shining a torch into the back seat. </p> <p>\"Hey, fellas, what's going on here?\" </p> <p>\"Nuttin' officer, we're just takin' Miz Jowell for a li'l ride in the country.\" </p> <p>\"In the middle of the night?\" </p> <p>\"Sure ting. Dat way the sun won't hurt her eyes. Ain't that right, Tessa?\" </p> <p>A Labour backbencher wanted to know if the laughable new rules to protect children would mean a parent could be prosecuted for letting a child roll a 10p piece in the hopes of winning a cuddly toy. </p> <p>(Correct answer: possibly. But the parent could certainly spend \u00a31,000 a week on the slots, because the British electorate is \"sophisticated enough to know what to do with its own money\".) </p> <p>At last she was mercifully released from this horror and allowed to sit down. </p> <p>But after this debacle it looks as if large parts of the bill will soon sleep with the fishes.</p>",
  "Almost four decades ago, during the Vietnam war, the great liberal, Senator J William Fulbright, captured more eloquently than any recent commentary what is a stake in today's US presidential election. There were, he said, two Americas: \"One is generous and humane, the other narrowly egotistical; one is self-critical, the other self-righteous; one is sensible, the other romantic; one is good humoured, the other solemn; one is inquiring, the other pontificating; one is moderate, the other filled with passionate intensity; one is judicious and the other arrogant in the use of great power.\" <p>Which of these two Americas prevails today is a question of huge significance for us all. It can be seen in the intensity of interest across the globe and in the large numbers of Americans who say this is the most important election of their lifetime. The outcome will determine whether America reaches out to the world in a spirit of partnership or continues with its posture of sullen rejectionism. It will determine whether this misdirected war on terror continues to escalate into a clash of civilisations that puts us all in greater danger, or can be turned into an effective campaign to address the political causes of terrorism. </p> <p>It will also determine the course of American politics for a generation. With up to four supreme court judges likely to be replaced in the next four years, the occupant of the White House will be in a unique position to influence the direction of American constitutional law. A Bush victory would enable him to entrench his harsh, moralistic conservatism in ways that would be impossible to reverse for many years. A Kerry presidency would have less room for manoeuvre, but might at least stop the rot that has seen American liberalism in almost continuous retreat since the 1960s. This is a battle for America's political soul. </p> <p>For most of the democratic world, there are good reasons for wanting a Kerry victory. His promise to create a much broader international coalition against terrorism carries with it an implicit acceptance that the views of countries other than America must once again be made to count for something. To lead, he will have to generate consent. Even so, it is important not to exaggerate the extent to which a change of president would lead to a change in American foreign policy. </p> <p>In order to mount a credible challenge to Bush, Kerry has felt the need to pander to Republican prejudices across a wide range of issues. Don't, for example, hold your breath for ratification of the Kyoto treaty or a tough line against Israel's land grab in the West Bank. The limits of the possible will be determined by, among other things, a Congress that looks set to remain firmly in Republican hands. Whoever occupies the White House, conservatism will remain America's governing ideology for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>The reasons for this need to be analysed and understood if there is to be any hope of bringing America back into the community of responsible nations on anything more than an occasional basis. This is about much more than one administration and the policies it pursues. It is fundamentally a question of global power relations and the distorting impact of American primacy. As Fulbright argued: \"Power tends to confuse itself with virtue and a great nation is particularly susceptible to the idea that its power is a sign of God's favour.\" Along with the preponderance of American power comes an unshakeable faith in the superiority of American ideas and an irresistible urge to act on them. The folly is to imagine that it could be otherwise. </p> <p>For Britain, this poses some uncomfortable choices. We could continue to pursue our \"special relationship\" in the hope that America behaves with enough self-restraint to avoid compromising other relationships that matter to us, most notably in Europe. This would certainly be easier with Kerry in the White House, but it would do nothing to address structural causes of America's lurch to the right. By putting fidelity to the \"special relationship\" first, we can only weaken Europe's collective voice and encourage America's unilateralist impulse, further souring transatlantic relations and leaving us exposed - the choice we have always attempted to avoid. </p> <p>The truth is that if we want a durable transatlantic partnership that works in the common interests of Europe and America, it will only become possible if Britain is prepared to abandon the illusion of \"specialness\" in its relations with America and give priority to the objective of forging a common European approach. This is not primarily a matter of treaties and institutions; it is much more a question of mindset. One of the most remarkable features of the Iraq war was the extent to which several European governments were willing to ignore the opposition of their own voters in order to support Bush. Like the native administrators of some colonised land, there is the tendency in parts of Europe, and Britain in particular, for the political classes to identify more with the \"colonial power\" than with the people they are supposed to represent. </p> <p>Tony Blair represents such an extreme example of this condition that it is difficult to imagine how a Europe that includes him among its leaders can ever hope to restore to the transatlantic relationship a necessary measure of balance. </p> <p>Yet what is the alternative? Michael Howard's adoption of a more critical position on the war and the Bush-Blair relationship is utterly unconvincing, and the Liberal Democrats, though sincere, are not yet ready for government. The only other potential prime minister, Gordon Brown, is still mired in third-way ambiguity, positioning Britain as equidistant from Washington and Brussels. Few doubt that he, like Blair, would have followed Bush into Iraq; yet even so, there is one important difference between them that at least raises the possibility that a change of leader might enable Britain to loosen the suffocating embrace of the \"special relationship\". It comes down to an issue of pride. </p> <p>It is entirely likely that Blair, in moments of private reflection, understands that he made an enormous mistake in selling his support to George Bush so cheaply. But even if this were the case, any public admission that he got it wrong would, at this late stage, destroy the little authority he retains. Consequently, he is obliged to plough ahead without any room for manoeuvre. Brown carries none of this baggage. The only limitations he has are the ones he chooses for himself by failing to signal a change of direction. Were he to do so, it would send a powerful signal to sections of the Labour party that remain far from convinced that a leadership challenge would be worth the trouble. </p> <p>Whether today's vote goes for Bush or Kerry, Britain and Europe need a fresh start in their relations with America. This will only be possible if we are prepared to take tough decisions and weather the inevitable storm of protest from Washington. The prize of a stronger and more balanced partnership between Europe and America is considerable. What it requires is an act of real leadership. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Clark is a former Labour government adviser </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Dkclark@aol.com\">Dkclark@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<p>John Prescott conceded yesterday that electors were still unsure about the benefits of devolution for the north-east, three days before a referendum to determine whether the region should have an elected assembly. </p> <p>With the latest voting figures in the all-postal ballot now above the turnout in the 1998 London mayoral referendum, the deputy prime minister began his fourth week of intensive campaigning by acknowledging that a yes on Thursday was \"touch and go\". </p> <p>Yesterday, the regional counting centre in Sunderland announced that more than 35% of ballot papers had been returned, raising the prospect of turnout approaching 50%, according to Mr Prescott. </p> <p>In a deeply personal attack on the deputy prime minister last week, the Tories' regional spokesman, Bernard Jenkin, said he would eat his hat if the turnout was anything approaching 50%. </p> <p>Relaxing briefly on Labour's battlebus between impromptu rallies on the streets of Tyneside, Mr Prescott said the party's polling had shown many of the region's 1.9 million electors were still undecided. </p> <p>\"People are wanting to vote, but we're not sure how it is going to break,\" he said. \"There is still a lot to play for.\" </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, long a lone champion of English devolution in the government, has been campaigning with occasional support from cabinet colleagues for much of the past month. </p> <p>Fortunately for him, the broad yes campaign has been helped by personalities outside party politics, notably the independent mayor of Middlesbrough, Ray Mallon. </p> <p>While Mr Prescott was on the stump in South Shields, Mr Mallon told a large crowd in Newcastle that the no campaign had acted \"dishonourably\" by exploiting fears rather than raising expectations. Earlier, he revealed he had rejected requests from Michael Howard and Bernard Jenkin to join the no camp. </p> <p>\"There are those to say the no campaign is non-political,\" he said earlier in Durham \"This is deceit. If you vote no then you vote for the Conservatives.\" </p> <p>A few miles away, Mr Prescott spoke alongside a mascot labelled Tory boy, which has become his stage prop - a silent, pinstripe-suited man with a mask, a blue rosette and a placard reading: \"London Tories say vote no.\" </p> <p>Both camps have tried to steer away from class politics, with the Tories staying in the background and keeping leading spokespeople away from the north-east. The yes campaign has also been downplaying party politics, stressing a broad base embracing businesspeople, trade unions and regional personalities. </p> <p>But over the past few days, caution has been thrown to the wind, with the no campaign labelled a Tory front by opponents. The charge is denied, although the campaign's main spokesman is a former Tory candidate who does public relations work for the party. </p> <p>Now that there is little prospect of a commanding yes, the deputy prime minister said the result this week was more likely to be closer to the Welsh experience than the outcome of the Scottish and London referendums. In 1997, voters in Wales backed an assembly by a margin of 0.6%.</p>",
  "<p>From the moment I entered educational politics in the 1930s, I became convinced that the ending of the divided post-primary system and the abolition of privilege within it was the crucial step needed to give working-class children their birthright in education. The questions were, how? And what would we put in its place?</p> <p>The 1944 Education Act provided secondary education according to \"age, aptitude and ability\". Such innocent and commonsense-sounding words. But they became the foundation of a postwar system every bit as divided and class-biased as in the bad, pre-war days.</p> <p>It was put over by the con trick of renaming \"senior schools\" as \"modern schools\". It was \"modern\", apparently, to leave school earlier than in the grammar schools, to have larger classes, and to lack specialist teachers, for example in maths, science and modern languages. It was \"modern\" to spend less on those who needed education most.</p> <p>What appeared to be final success was achieved by the Wilson government, which decided that rather than set up a compulsory system throughout the country, it would replace the existing divided system by a comprehensive one under the effective control of the LEAs.</p> <p>Most LEAs responded quickly and, after 1967, comprehensives began to cover the country. Many, however, could not be truly comprehensive because of the continued existence of grammar schools, and because of the difficulty of developing the new schools within existing unsuitable buildings. So the new system was flawed: the money was not made available; hybrid systems continued for years in some LEAs; and many comprehensives were so only in name.</p> <p>The magnitude of the problems created by a changeover from a selective to an unselective system was simply not appreciated. Yet Britain was about to undertake an unprecedented transformation of its educational structure. The challenges of developing comprehensive schools were, in practice, left to be solved by each LEA in its own way, in the face of its own difficulties.</p> <p>Among the LEAs that responded speedily was my own, Brent, where I was head of a secondary modern school. Brent wanted, ultimately, to create a system of 11-18 comprehensives. I was appointed to one of the first of these, Willesden high school, in November 1966, with the school scheduled to open in September 1967.</p> <p>I had the task in Willesden high school, formed by amalgamating a grammar, a secondary technical and a secondary modern, of planning a comprehensive. Instead of campaigning for a comprehensive, I had the job of organising and running one.</p> <p>There were serious problems. In Brent, the authority had, regrettably - from expediency, not principles - decided to pay for children who opted out into grammar, denominational, direct-grant or independent schools elsewhere. So a fair number of academically able children were lost to the school.</p> <p>Although my catchment area, as I used to say, stretched from Rolls-Royce land to slumdom, it was clear we would not have a totally unselective entry. On the contrary, we would become an almost exclusively working-class and increasingly black neighbourhood school. I was not alarmed, as some were, about this. If the job of the comprehensive was, as I firmly believed, to raise the educational standards of the majority, how better to begin than with a school population previously denied full educational opportunity?</p> <p>Could we really be called comprehensive with such an obviously flawed composition? My answer was, yes, a comprehensive in course of development. If we were to wait for ideal conditions - 100% entry from the local population, a new or suitably modified set of buildings properly equipped, a thoroughly trained comprehensive-dedicated staff and so on we would have had to wait for the Greek Kalends. We had to start with an educational landscape disfigured by the private sector and grammar schools in neighbouring boroughs. We had to get on with the job under the conditions we had inherited.</p> <p>My instructions were to continue existing courses for all children in the school at the time of the merger. So, while we could organise a comprehensive curriculum for the new entry, for some considerable time we would be running this side-by-side with grammar, technical and modern courses for the majority.</p> <p>But I was determined to interpret my remit very broadly. I was going to maintain the grammar-technical children's standards and offer them new opportunities, while substantially improving the education available to the modern school pupils.</p> <p>I began a long process of consultation. I interviewed every member of staff to learn what I could about them and to explain what we would be trying to do. I attended school assemblies and social functions, met the PTA of the tech - no PTA existed in the grammar school, and the one in the modern school was defunct.</p> <p>No one suggested I should prepare plans for the approval, far less the decisions, of a governing body, or in consultation with parents. The authority made it clear it had appointed me because it thought I could do the job - and I was expected to get on with it. Such a modus operandi would be impossible today.</p> <p>I had no hesitations about staff deployment. We were one school and would be one staff. Thus my timetable instructions to heads of department were to use all their staff throughout the school, especially for the new entry. There was no reason why modern school staff should not take grammar-tech classes, where able, and it would be good for the others to get used to teaching the slower learners. The children had to get the best that we had to offer.</p> <p>The new entry would have a genuinely comprehensive education, with everything anyone could reasonably include in a \"common core\" - science, technical and practical studies, art, music, French, as well as the staple subjects. For nearly all the children, this was a substantial extension of opportunity over what would have occurred under the old system.</p> <p>Having studied the records of the children in the modern school and, later, seeing the composition of the new entry, I made what I believe was the most crucial decision of all if we were to succeed as a comprehensive. It was to deploy a substantial part of our staffing allocation in creating what was to become the largest remedial department in the country (later renamed special education).</p> <p>The big problem was getting staff properly trained for the job. Lack of professional expertise had to be compensated for by enthusiasm.</p> <p>We had no infallible way of deciding admission to a remedial class for the simple reason that no such criteria existed. We decided to adopt a pragmatic approach, including primary school reports and reading tests. Most important, it was essential to recognise that any placement was provisional and what mattered was how, after a while, their teachers estimated each child's ability to cope. The objective was to move children out of a remedial class into the mainstream.</p> <p>To abolish the remedial department altogether would have been the biggest success of all. Alas, remedial work did not always produce the hoped-for results - permanent improvement of attainment. Children can fall back. We still know too little about how children learn and how to deal with their learning difficulties.</p> <p>Other problems seemed insignificant beside this one. I outlawed corporal punishment, though not everyone agreed. We began building a highly successful pastoral system. This seems commonplace today, but I am writing of the 1960s, when it was far from common. Those who criticised deployment of staff on pastoral work can have had no idea of how absolutely essential it was if comprehensives were to succeed.</p> <p>A PTA was organised. I visited all the feeder primary schools to meet the children and their staff and heads. We held meetings for new parents. We opened in September 1967 with what I hoped and expected to be a smoothly running organisation.</p> <p>Six months later, we held our first speech day, with Christopher Hill, the master of Balliol, an old friend and keen comprehensive advocate, as guest speaker. As I listened to his warm words for what he had seen, I felt relaxed for the first time in 15 months. We seemed set fair for the future.</p> <p>Five years later, when the first entry had completed the statutory secondary school course, I listened to another guest, Vic Feather, TUC general secretary, kiss the blarney stone (\"the best comprehensive school I have seen yet\") after I had made my fifth annual report. That had shown conclusively that in exam results, all those who would have been selected for grammar school under the old system had done about as well as they would have done under that system, while the rest - the great majority - had done substantially better.</p> <p>Whether a school is a success or not depends on many factors. But, I reflected, we had beaten the Cassandras on the one factual criterion they had forecast we could not fulfil. We had proved that while we were advancing the education of the slower pupils, those ahead in the race did not suffer.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is an edited extract from The Route to My Comprehensive, by Max Morris, which appears in A Tribute to Caroline Benn: Education and Democracy, edited by Melissa Benn and Clyde Chitty (Continuum, \u00a314.99).

  "<p>It was a scenario that could have come straight from a Dick Francis novel. Last night it emerged that police had been called in after part of a doping sample taken from the horse of the Irish Olympic showjumping gold medallist Cian O'Connor went missing from a laboratory in Cambridgeshire. </p> <p>The International Equestrian Federation (FEI) said the sample had been \"taken illegally\" while en route from Paris to Newmarket. </p> <p>O'Connor, the winner of Ireland's only medal in Athens, had requested the result of Waterford Crystal's B sample after the horse had tested positive for a sedative at the games. </p> <p>If it confirms the result of the A sample he will be stripped of his gold medal. But, if the authorities are unable to test the B-sample properly, the 24-year-old O'Connor may be allowed to keep the medal. </p> <p>The sample was being shipped by a courier service from the Medication Control Programme Central Laboratory in Paris to the Horseracing Forensic Laboratory in Newmarket, considered to be the world leader in equine testing. </p> <p>Cambridgeshire police confirmed last night that it was investigating an allegation of theft. \"On Tuesday 26 October the police were notified that a urine sample from a horse, which had participated in an equestrian event, was believed to have been stolen on Thursday 21 October,\" a spokeswoman said. </p> <p>\"The sample was due to have been delivered by couriers to the Horse Racing Forensic Laboratory on Newmarket Road in Fordham, however the sample never arrived. The courier company delivered the package, which was signed off. It was only later the sample was discovered to have been stolen. </p> <p>\"Police are investigating this incident and until all inquiries have been completed it would be inappropriate to speculate. However, we would appeal for anyone with information to contact officers at Ely Police Station.\" </p> <p>Avril Doyle, the president of the Equestrian Federation of Ireland, has asked for additional information from the FEI in Switzerland and has also requested an immediate meeting with the international governing body. \"At this stage there are more questions than answers. But I don't like what I'm hearing,\" she said. </p> <p>Colin McClelland, a spokesman for the Irish federation, said: \"When they take a sample, it can be a sample of both blood and urine. So perhaps only one is missing. But the truth is we don't know. We only heard about this theft at two o'clock today, a week and a half or so after the fact.\" </p> <p>McClelland said Waterford Crystal's B sample was sent to Newmarket - along with samples from German Olympic winners and other non-Olympic winning horses - because all those involved had agreed on the choice of laboratory. Under FEI rules the B sample results were to be released within 21 days. </p> <p>After the banned substance was found in the sample of Waterford Crystal - owned by Tony O'Reilly, the former Lions rugby player who is also the owner of the Independent newspaper - it later emerged that a second of O'Connor's horses had failed a drugs test. </p> <p>The same sedative appeared in a sample taken from ABC Landliebe at an event in Rome as showed up in a test on Waterford Crystal in Athens. The sedative is often given to horses to calm them down but is banned by equestrian authorities. </p> <p>O'Connor's veterinary surgeon James Sheeran had said the sedative was given to Waterford Crystal to help treat a leg injury he sustained in July. </p> <p>O'Connor said that instead of prescribing a course of medication that might linger in the system, he and Sheeran opted for physical therapy in a hydrotherapy unit. To calm the animal and stop him potentially injuring himself more seriously, they gave him a sedative. Sheeran said there could only have been a few molecules of the chemical in the horse's system, adding that he was shocked that the sedative appeared in a test five weeks later. The Kildare-based vet has questioned whether Olympic testing is now too sensitive. </p> <p>Although on the banned list it is not an offence to treat an injured horse with the drug, as long as it clears the horse's system before it takes part in competition. Sheeran said he was convinced that this sedative would leave the horse's system in a week or at most a fortnight. </p> <p>O'Connor, who was not returning calls last night, has denied giving his horses banned performance-enhancing drugs. </p> <p>O'Connor has previously accused \"jealous\" people of trying to taint his medal glory and insisted: \"I've nothing to hide. People are putting out red herrings about me. </p> <p>\"I have been the most successful rider to come from nowhere to the top through hard work. Perhaps there are some jealous people out there.\"</p>",
  "<p>Americans might have had more on their minds recently than Thunderbirds-style marionettes, but the 1960s sci-fi puppet series is the inspiration for a shockingly \"politically incorrect movie ... causing a storm in the US\", you begin, cribbing from Justin Penrose in the <strong>Sunday Mirror</strong>. </p> <p>The puppets star in Team America: World Police, the new film from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Like the cult animated TV series, you say, the film pulls no punches. It \"depicts Arabs and Asians speaking heavily-accented English that sounds like gibberish, a Broadway show that presents Aids as musical entertainment and brutal scenes in which puppets resembling Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins are mutilated\". </p> <p>But the \"really scandalous\" thing about Team America is not the \"scatological, scatter-shot\" satire, you insist, reciting from the <strong>Sunday Times</strong>'s Christopher Goodwin. It's not even the scenes showing puppet sex. Rather, \"it's that, in an election year in which left and right have been huffing and puffing as never before\", the film \"has the audacity to wish a plague on both their houses\". It targets liberal \"peacenik sissies\" and \"war-mongering jerks\" on the right with equal relish. </p> <p>The film is especially fierce when lampooning \"the out-of-control culture of celebrity political pontification\", you argue, echoing Kurt Loder at <strong>MTV.com</strong>. Parker and Stone reserve their \"pure, focused contempt\" for the likes of Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin and other \"showbiz windbags\". The film attacks Hollywood for turning American politics \"into another branch of entertainment\", you continue, stealing from Terence Blacker in the <strong>Independent</strong>. The film wants to show that \"we are in danger of being luvvied up, our political sensibilities turned to tinsel.\" </p> <p>But perhaps Team America's \"admirably balanced ... offensiveness policy\" is not quite as impartial as it first seems, you suggest, repeating James Delingpole's words in the <strong>Times</strong>. The film clearly mocks \"rightwing targets\", but it's the \"lefty-baiting scenes\" in which liberal icons \"die gleefully hideous deaths\" that have caused the biggest fuss. Stone and Parker have even been called \"sinister propagandists\" for George Bush. The film offers a \"distinct moral point of view\", you add, quoting the <strong>New York Times</strong>'s AO Scott, and \"expresses a blunt, uncynical patriotism\". </p> <p>Whatever the film-makers' political convictions, they should be congratulated, you conclude, thanks to Justine Elias in the <strong>Observer</strong>. Other American film-makers churn out \"prestige epics\", but \"the guys from South Park ... have made the only entertainment that dares to confront the pertinent issue: whether, and how, the US is supposed to be the world police.\"</p>",
  "His last film, Kill Bill, bravely incorporated Japanese, Chinese and Spanish dialogue into a mainstream Hollywood movie, but Quentin Tarantino's next project promises to dispense with the English language altogether. It will be shot entirely in Mandarin, he claims, and it will be \"another kung fu that's gonna blow your asses off\". <p>The announcement comes as a surprise, as it was widely believed that the director was preparing his long-delayed war movie, Inglorious Bastards, having finally completed the two-part Kill Bill last year. But according to an interview in Total Film magazine, that is no longer the case.</p> <p>Like Kill Bill, Inglorious Bastards is \"ballooning\", said Tarantino, and could again be split into two movies. \"Before, I want to do something much smaller.\"</p> <p>And in homage to the kung fu films of the 1970s that so in fluenced Tarantino, the new film will also be available in a version with subtitles and an English language version with old-school, out-of-sync dubbing.</p> <p>The idea of making another martial arts movie came to Tarantino after seeing Zhang Yimou's House of Flying Daggers at the Cannes film festival this year. Like Tarantino, Zhang had to learn the skills of Chinese action directing from scratch for his movie Hero.</p> <p>\"He's spent a year and a half learning to make that kind of martial arts movie,\" said Tarantino. \"So what does he want to do? Make another one. That shit just made sense to me.\"</p> <p>Tarantino spent many months shooting Kill Bill's kung-fu scenes at China's Beijing Film Studio, working with predominantly Chinese cast and crew, many of whom he will be hiring again.</p> <p>\"He had a really good time shooting Kill Bill there,\" his publicity agent, Bumble Ward, said. \"And I don't think he's fully exercised that muscle.\"</p> <p>China has another persuasive advantage: extremely low costs. Kill Bill cost approximately $60m (about \u00a332.6m) to shoot, a fraction of what it would have cost had it been shot entirely in the US.</p> <p>Worldwide, the two films generated more than $330m at the box office. Another quick, cheap martial arts film under the Tarantino brand name could be even more profitable.</p> <p>Tarantino is currently writing the movie, which he will spend five months shooting in about a year's time.</p> <p>It is unclear whether he will stick to native Mandarin speakers or encourage Hollywood stars to learn the language, as he did with Kill Bill. In that film, Chinese martial artist Gordon Liu had some sharp words for Uma Thurman's linguistic efforts: \"Your Mandarin is lousy. I can't understand a single word you say. It causes my ears discomfort.\"</p>",
  "Most professors would be happy to be considered a pioneer in just one discipline. Sitting in David Canter's office at Liverpool University, surrounded by the academic by-products of crime, it is easy to forget that he has actually managed it in two. <p>Since the early 1990s, Canter's name has been synonymous with investigative psychology.</p> <p>It was Canter who came up with the idea that you could pull together a lot of different strands from the social sciences, psychology and geography to feed into the criminal investigative process. It was Canter who coined the term \"investigative psychology\" and established the postgraduate course in the subject. And it was Canter who had both the clout and the funding to insist that Liverpool took not only him, but also his colleagues Ian Donald and Margaret Wilson, when they poached him from the University of Surrey.</p> <p>In the past 10 years, the subject has picked up a momentum of its own. Canter's ideas have been followed and developed in universities and police forces around the world; investigative psychology even has its own publication, the Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling; and only last week he got an email telling him there is now an Italian Association of Investigative Psychology. Yet in the world of offender profiling, Canter is still the man with the highest profile.</p> <p>But it was in the evolution of environmental psychology - the study of the impact of buildings on people and how people make sense of place - that Canter first made his name, back in the 1970s. The central thesis of his 1977 book, The Psychology of Place, has become a standard text and has even been cited in the Scottish law courts.</p> <p>Even now, Canter keeps his hand in. He has studied patterns of behaviour in fires and emergencies, most notably the King's Cross tube disaster - \"It was fascinating to see how some people's behaviour remained consistent with the patterns dictated by their understanding of place to the point where they were consumed by smoke and died\" - and has just recently been awarded an Engineering and Physical Science Research grant to study the evacuation of the World Trade Centre.</p> <p>Research for research's sake has never been of much interest to Canter. The main reason he morphed into investigative psychology was that he felt environmental psychology had talked itself into an academic cul-de-sac. \"We had some influence in the way architects thought about what they were doing,\" he says, \"but the reality is that we had little overall impact.</p> <p>\"Our failure was not to get to grips with what architects do. Instead, we thought about what was of interest to us and studied that. It's no wonder that psychology has now been dropped from almost all architecture courses.</p> <p>\"When I started investigative psychology, I wanted it to engage directly with the police investigative and decision-making process. The work should be about understanding how the police work and providing them with useful tools to filter data in the course of an investigation; it's not about being an outside expert offering a Sherlock Holmes-like opinion that the police decide how best to use.\"</p> <p>Predictably, though, it was the Holmes stereotype that proved irresistible to the media and the public imagination, and gave rise to TV programmes such as Cracker and any number of experts queuing up to offer their opinions on unsolved criminal cases. One such voice was Paul Britton, a forensic psychologist with no academic track record, whose advice led to the police entrapment exercise that culminated in the collapse of the Colin Stagg trial for the murder of Rachel Nickell.</p> <p>Canter accepts a small part of the blame for the fixation with the rent-a-shrink approach. He got into investigative psychology through his work in the late 1980s on a series of sexual assaults, rapes and murders committed by a man the police identified as the Railway Rapist. Canter's scientific analysis of the crimes and their locations led him to hypothesise where the culprit might live, and as a result John Duffy was caught and convicted.</p> <p>The problem was that at the same time as he provided the scientific data, Canter also produced a plausible psychological narrative for the progression and escalation of the Railway Rapist's crimes. This explanation proved to be uncannily accurate, and it was that which stuck in everyone's memory, rather than the more important data on the relation of geography and location to offending.</p> <p>Offender profiling lost much of its media appeal after the Stagg fiasco, but Canter's reputation remained intact. He had always kept apart from those he described as \"serial bullshitters\" and even his 1994 best-selling book, Criminal Shadows, which won the Gold Dagger award for crime non-fiction, was uncompromisingly scholarly: lurid details of crimes were kept to a bare minimum and, unlike many of his US counterparts, he virtually wrote himself out of the story, refusing to position himself as the hero. </p> <p>Canter appreciates the anonymity, though he recognises that the media's love affair with profiling prior to Stagg gave him tremendous bargaining power in his move to Liverpool. \"I knew that all universities get excited by something new and gradually lose interest over time,\" he says. \"I expected Liverpool to chip away at any deal it made. So I made sure I negotiated a deal that would leave me with enough even after it had been eroded.\"</p> <p>Not that he's complaining. Well, not too much. He is irritated that the university refused to countenance the expansion of the department even after he had submitted a business plan that showed he could produce \u00a3250,000 pure profit each year after three years.</p> <p>The department receives over 200 applications a year, but can take only 16 postgraduate students, even though it acts as a magnet for research funding. While many departments are struggling, Canter has four PhD students on grants from the Economic and Social Research Council, and outside funding from such disparate groups as the police, insurance companies and others. The returns are just as good for the students. \"Of the members of the police we have taken on, all have become superintendent within two years,\" he says, \"and anyone who leaves with a PhD can take their pick of an academic post.\"</p> <p>This is not said boastfully, but as a simple matter of fact. Now aged 60, he's too long in the tooth to bother to engage in academic hyperbole and there is still far too much work to do to allow many outside distractions. After some early advances in the study of offending patterns, his research has become ever more complicated and many of the conventional wisdoms have been turned on their head.</p> <p>\"The idea that you can say something about the personality of an offender by the nature of the crime has proved to be unsubstantiated,\" he says. \"And I've come to realise that the real power of investigative psychology is in the study of volume crimes, such as robbery, car theft and burglary, rather than the more bizarre crimes that make the papers.</p> <p>\"In fiction, it is quite easy to link crimes because someone comes in and says they're linked, but in reality it is far harder to make those jumps. So much of the work is about establishing consistency in offending behaviour.\"</p> <p>Canter's aim is to provide the police with tools, including software, to enable them better to focus their investigations. This is well illustrated by the failure of the Jill Dando inquiry.</p> <p>The police knew, almost from day one, that the killer had escaped on foot. Had Canter been consulted, he could have told them that over 80% of killers who escape on foot live within 525 yards of the crime. It took the police over a year to question and arrest Barry George, a man with a record of stalking celebrities. He lived within the 525-yard radius.</p> <p>\"The point is not that it was Barry George and that I turned out to be right,\" he says. \"The point is that, with a focused investigation, the police could have got to him a great deal earlier than they did and eliminated him if necessary.\" It's a generous disclaimer, but as with much of Canter's work, the results speak for themselves.</p> <p><b>The CV</b></p> <p><b>Name:</b> David Canter</p> <p><b>Age :</b> 60</p> <p><b>Job :</b> professor of psychology and director of the centre for investigative psychology, Liverpool University</p> <p><b>Before that:</b> professor of psychology, University of Surrey; managing editor, Journal of Environmental Psychology</p> <p><b>Publications :</b> Psychology for Architects (1974); Psychology of Place (1977); Criminal Shadows, (1994); Interviewing and Deception (1999); Mapping Murder (2003)</p> <p><b>Likes:</b> composing music</p> <p><b>Dislikes:</b> jobsworths</p> <p><b>Married :</b> with three children</p>",
  "<p>No gambler would offer good odds on today's big announcement by the Department for Education and Skills getting much of a fanfare in tomorrow's papers. Anything related to \"further education\", let alone the details of the government's plans for reforming the initial training of its teaching body, is a known turn-off for most of the media.</p> <p>Nevertheless, if there is truth in Labour's rhetoric about the salience of the sector for Britain's economic future, then there cannot be anything that is more important to get right in the whole of the education system.</p> <p>\"It's further education teachers who have to go in where schools have failed,\" says Ros Clow, senior lecturer in post-compulsory education at Oxford Brookes university.</p> <p>This is one of the unifying factors in a very disparate group.

They may not have any qualifications but they are brilliant with people whom schools couldn't do anything with.\"</p> <p>Given the scale and importance of the task they are given, it is surely staggering that FE lecturers have only latterly been required to hold teaching qualifications. And even now that this is a requirement, the vast majority of teaching staff - nine out of 10 - do not achieve the necessary certificate before they are let loose on students, but get their training as they go along.</p> <p>The blueprint the government is publishing today, entitled Equipping Our Teachers for the Future: reforming initial teacher training for the learning and skills sector, has much that should impress colleges.</p> <p>\"I'm very happy about many aspects of it,\" says Clow, who had a hand in its preparation. She represented the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers on the advisory panel.</p> <p>The reform introduces a new qualification, qualified teacher learning and skills (QTLS), which will be achieved in two stages. A trainee will have to complete an initial \"passport to teaching\" module, involving about 30 hours of \"guided learning\". This will be at a level 3, the equivalent of A-levels. Then he or she will have up to five years to complete the full teacher training, although many will do so in less time. This will \"allow the new teacher time to acquire the practical skills and to master the written parts of the course\".</p> <p>The first trainees are expected to register for their passport courses in 2007.</p> <p>Both parts will consist of a mix of theory and practice. The taught theory elements are to be designed to apply to all disciplines. Skills that are specific to particular subjects will have to be acquired in the college where the trainee is working. This means, the blueprint document says, that mentoring \"by line managers, subject experts or experienced teachers in related curriculum areas is essential\".</p> <p>There will be no literacy or numeracy requirements for people wanting to start the training, but they will need to demonstrate specified standards in these before they qualify.</p> <p>The QTLS, a level 5 qualification, will be awarded by the Institute for Learning (IFL), a fledgling professional body for college teachers that has yet to attract many members. The institute will register all those starting passport courses.</p> <p>Ofsted will continue to inspect the 50 higher education institutions that do initial teacher training for further education. Indeed, according to its framers, Ofsted's highly critical verdict on the quality of initial teacher training in further education, published a year ago, has informed the new programme.</p> <p>What is unclear is why such a \"great herd of quangos\", to use Baroness Thatcher's memorable jibe at Labour bureaucracy, should be needed to get the venture going and keep it aloft. These include Lifelong Learning UK (LLUK), the further education sector skills council, the IFL, the FE standards unit within the DfES, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the Learning and Skills Council, the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Quality and Assurance Agency.</p> <p>Kim Howells, the new further education minister, says the views of many organisations and individuals who responded to the preceding consultation have been carefully listened to. The document notes FE teachers' desire for \"parity of esteem and of professionalism\" with school teachers. So why have the separate QTLS certificate? Why not operate a common, qualified teacher status certificate for both sectors?</p> <p>The cynic might suppose that the new certificate is an effort to stem the flow of FE teachers into better-paid and more secure jobs in schools. \"I don't think that has driven our thinking in the design for these proposals,\" declares Jane Williams, head of the DfES's post-16 standards unit.</p> <p>What FE lecturers surely want above all is parity of pay with school teachers, and if the two workforces are not to share a common qualification, then closure of the \u00a35,000-a-year salary gap is the only proof that parity means anything beyond empty words.</p> <p>Williams recites the standard government line. \"Pay is a matter for employers. It's not something that the department regulates.\"</p> <p>Norman Lucas, director of post-compulsory teacher education at the Institute of Education, who carried out a research project for the DfES on initial teacher education programmes for basic skills teachers, is uneasy about the promise of \u00a330m in 2007-08 to cover workplace support for trainee teachers. That, coupled with the lack of a firm commitment to institute a probationary year for newly qualified teachers - mandatory in schools - raises suspicions that the mentoring intention isn't up to much. </p> <p>\"A probationary year is not only good practice,\" he says. \"It means that people who have just qualified are entitled to professional development in their first years of work.\"</p> <p>Clow shares Lucas's reservations about the dependence of the new teacher training regime on two new and untested bodies, the LLUK and the IFL.</p> <p>The government clearly wants to promote the IFL, which is firmly within the LLUK, as the professional body for FE teachers. At the same time, says Clow, the government will not fund the IFL, though it does fund the school teachers' professional body, the General Teaching Council.</p> <p>\"We don't see why employers should control the professional body for FE teachers when they don't control it in higher education or schools,\" she says.</p>",
  "<p>The achievements and innovation of business students across the UK were celebrated at the seventh annual awards for business and management students, run by the Association of Business Schools (ABS), last month.</p> <p>The 2004 awards saw a record number of entries in both categories: the undergraduate award, based on students' work placements; and the postgraduate award, which is given to a student who has formed new businesses or introduced new products or services as a result of their studies.</p> <p>The two winners were Elizabeth Penny, an undergraduate BSc student in international business with Spanish at Warwick business school, and Roderick Sutherland, who is currently completing a part-time MBA at Napier University and a part-time PhD in electronics and electrical engineering at the University of Glasgow. Each will receive \u00a32,500 as their prize and will also go forward to the National Business Awards on November 9, where one of them will win business student of the year.</p> <p>The ABS represents the leading 100 business schools of UK universities, higher education institutions and independent management centres, with a combined undergraduate and postgraduate population of more than 200,000 students. The awards were presented at the ABS annual dinner in Manchester by Professor Arthur Francis, chair of the ABS.</p> <p>\"These students join a long list of previous ABS award winners who have shown outstanding initiative, enterprise, determination and business acumen,\" he said. \"They represent just a few of the thousands of students at our business schools, many of whom will become the UK business leaders of tomorrow. We are delighted to honour young people who will help form a new generation of managers and entrepreneurs.\"</p> <p>Penny spent a year working for Masterfoods, part of Mars Inc, as part of her degree. She was based in Madrid, and her focus was improving the efficiency of the sales force. She trained the entire team in a new database and report formats - and all in Spanish. The judges felt she deserved the award for this alone, but her overall contribution to Masterfoods was described as \"outstanding\" and she has already been offered a job there when she finishes her degree.</p> <p>Second prize in the undergraduate category went to Niusha Koucheksarai, a BSc student in marketing management at the Lancaster University management school. During her year's work placement with BT, she managed internal communications with over 900 employees within corporate business, instigating an e-survey of employees and rejuvenating the intranet.</p> <p>In the same category, Rachel Montagu-Ebbe, also of Lancaster University management school, was highly commended for her work at IBM.</p> <p>In the postgraduate section, Sutherland was awarded first prize for his design and development of the intelligent audio analysis system. He will produce and market it through his company, Dynamic Innovations, which he established in April 2003.</p> <p>\"We're working on intelligent audiometry,\" he explains. \"We're developing a system that can test a person for work-related hearing loss with the same level of accuracy that they would get from visiting a doctor. It's designed for use in a work environment, by a non-medical operator.\"</p> <p>Dynamic Innovations is currently developing the product, ready for its launch next year. \"Any industry with work-related noise will benefit,\" says Sutherland. \"The Ministry of Defence, factories, bus and train operators, the building industry - the list is long.\"</p> <p>Hearing loss is one of the most common industrial injuries in developed countries: in the UK alone, it accounts for payouts of an average of \u00a3355m a year. The intelligent audio analysis system will, he says, be a cost-effective and flexible way for employers to screen employees' hearing. Revenue will be generated from the sale of audiometers and through the analysis of hearing test data.</p> <p>The idea for the system came to Sutherland after completing six months of service in Bosnia during the Balkan wars as a lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army. \"I had my hearing tested when I came back from Bosnia,\" he says. \"I looked at the automated system and thought: 'I could do better than that.' So I did.\"</p> <p>Fortunately for Sutherland, he was more than academically qualified to rise to the challenge. In addition to his MBA and PhD studies, he holds a BA in electronics, a BSc in electronics and computing, an MSc in electronics and electrical engineering, and an MSc in new venture creation.</p> <p>He sees his qualifications as an essential back-up to his work. \"If people ask why I'm in a position to know what I'm doing, I can show them my degrees. It's an excellent way to support the business. I am one of the best-qualified people in Scotland in the field I'm in.\"</p> <p>What's more, Sutherland's impressive array of degrees has been gained through part-time study. \"It's the mixture of academic qualifications and work experience that make me stand out. I never wanted to go into education full-time - it's there to support the work.\"</p> <p>The \u00a32,500 prize money will be used to buy test equipment. \"We've actually just bought a logic analyser,\" says Sutherland. \"It tests the operation of the micro-processor in the system, to check it's working properly.\"</p> <p>The money from the award comes in addition to \u00a3370,000 of private equity and government funding and investment for research and development. Sutherland wants the company to become the market leader in worldwide sales of screening audiometry equipment within the next six years.</p> <p>As well as the ABS awards, Sutherland has also won the Smart awards from the Scottish Executive 2004, the Junior Chamber of Commerce best business plan competition 2004, the Falkirk Action Plan e-business competition 2003 and an Enterprise Fellowship from the Royal Society of Edinburgh 2003.</p> <p>He credits his work in the Territorial Army, in which he has served for 21 years, as the secret of his success. As well as his time in Bosnia, he served six months in Kosovo. \"You wouldn't think business would have much in common with a war zone,\" he says, \"but in both you have to be used to change at short notice and prepared to work on your own initiative. They're more similar than you might realise.\"</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>The Association of Business Schools:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.the-abs.org.uk\">www.the-abs.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Grey Court school in Ham, south-west London, is not quite what you first expect. En route from Richmond you pass any number of \u00a31m houses, and its own grounds combine a listed building with some 1950s low-rise to present a solid collegiate feel. It shouts comfortable middle class, yet it is a school with inner-city problems. Many of the more well-off parents in the catchment area have sent their children to independent schools, leaving Grey Court to those children from the old Greater London Council estate, tucked away out of view further down the road. </p> <p>Even so, the school has done reasonably well. Its passes at GCSE are 12 percentage points higher than the national average, and only last year it added specialist status in maths, science and computing to its already acquired beacon status. But it has not done well enough for Ofsted, which, in December 2003, put the school into special measures on the grounds that it was in danger of failing. </p> <p>As part of the recovery measures, a new head was appointed; Rachel Jones, a former head and Ofsted inspector, took up the post in August this year. There's a lot to do: not least, to implement the rest of the government's workforce remodelling agreement. In September 2003, schools were required to transfer 24 administrative tasks from teachers to support staff, and told to allocate separate leadership time for those teachers with management responsibilities. Phase two kicked in this term, with the introduction of a maximum 38-hour annual limit for all teachers covering for absent colleagues. </p> <p>The final phase - a guaranteed 10% of timetabled teaching time to be given over to lesson planning, preparation and assessment (PPA); no requirement to invigilate exams; and dedicated leadership time for heads - is officially due to start in September next year. But three local education authorities (LEAs), Richmond, Nottingham and Liverpool, have jumped the gun and implemented PPA a year early as part of a pilot programme. Grey Court is one of the guinea-pig schools. </p> <p>But Jones isn't bothered, far from it. For her, the implementation of the workload agreement and the school remodelling agenda are an integral part of getting the school back on track. \"It's not just about getting the staff to feel better about themselves,\" she says. \"It's also about getting a better deal for the students. If staff are doing the jobs they are trained for, then pupils will be getting their educational needs met. </p> <p>\"For instance, we've got in a full-time attendance officer to save heads of year wasting time on following up kids not in school. I've also hired an IT specialist to run our systems: previously it was all ad hoc and the school didn't even have any standard letter templates. </p> <p>\"It also makes sense to hire a part-time social worker to help with problem kids, instead of putting a highly paid head of department with no counselling skills on the case. We also plan to get assistants in to supervise the brighter students on accelerated learning programmes en route to outside colleges; and at the needier end of the scale, it's better to have an assistant trained in helping with special needs than to deploy a whole-class specialist.\" </p> <p>This is just the start. Jones also has plans for learning mentors and has set up remodelling groups involving the whole school, including support staff. \"It's not about me telling them what to do,\" she insists. \"They know their jobs far better than me. All I'm doing is enabling them to think of ways of using their time more efficiently.\" She is adamant that all the changes will be cost-neutral. \"We're just redeploying existing resources in a way that will benefit everyone.\" </p> <p>It sounds too good to be true, but the evidence appears to back her up. The staff seem happy and last month the school passed its first Ofsted inspection since being put into special measures. On the evening the inspection finished, Jones laid on a selection of treats for the staff, including a massage. \"I know how stressful these things are and I just wanted to show that I understood how they were feeling and appreciated their hard work,\" she says. So how did the staff react? \"I think they liked it, though a few were rather bemused.\" </p> <p>You won't find this touchy-feely stuff in all schools, and it is fair to say there has been some resistance to the implementation of the workload agreement across the country. It didn't help that the agreement started in the year the government was hit by a disastrous row over school funding. Many heads were broke and angry, and did not accept the government line that almost all the savings could be found within existing budgets. </p> <p>Some LEAs are still dragging their heels, and many primary schools are still struggling to implement the changes, as they lack the staff numbers to be flexible. A survey for the School Teachers' Review Body in March showed that primary teachers' working hours actually went up, on average, from 51.8 hours to 52.5 hours, between 2003 and 2004. But increasingly, anecdotal evidence does suggest things are improving. While you still won't find many teachers who will admit to earning enough, plenty will tell you that conditions are getting better. We are not talking lie-ins, sunbeds and two-hour lunches, but at least there is more time to breathe, to plan ahead rather than firefight, and to have a semblance of a work-life balance. </p> <p>A little extra cash in the funding settlement this year, mixed in with the usual creativity from schools' financial administrators, has seen many more schools sign up to the agreement: roughly 20,000 now. </p> <p>Pat Collarbone, director of the National Remodelling Team (NRT), the agency supervising the new agenda, is well satisfied with progress so far. However, she is keen to stress that remodelling means more than just implementing the workload agreement. \"That's just the basic core,\" she says. \"But remodelling is more holistic than that. It's looking at how we want the schools of the future to look; how to do things differently. Of course, we also want exam results to improve, but that's just one side-effect of the changes. </p> <p>\"We're trying to join up services and agencies to fulfil the inclusion agenda. Many schools are currently working in competition with each other, and our aim is to promote collaboration and the sharing of good practice to deliver a personalised education system that meets every child's needs.\" </p> <p>She doesn't shrink from the fact that some schools are still to be won over, but doesn't think the time has yet come to get heavy. \"We want to work with people to help them resolve their problems,\" she says. \"That's why we have so many teams going round the country promoting the remodelling agenda. It's far better that we retain an anonymous, low profile.\" </p> <p>Chris Keates, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, disagrees. \"We've had enough carrot,\" she argues, \"and it's time for a little more stick. The workforce reforms are not government guidance; they are statutory measures, which all schools are obliged to implement. We've heard enough from schools about how there isn't enough money to make it work. In our view, the money is there and only last week we had a meeting with the DfES to discuss what sanctions should be taken against schools that still fail to comply.\" </p> <p>One of the reasons the NRT is happy to maintain a softly-softly approach is that it appears to be working. When the National Union of Teachers refused to sign up to the workload agreement, there were many who reckoned it was dead in the water before it started. But that has not been the case. </p> <p>\"We would naturally love the NUT to come on board,\" says Collarbone, \"but at a school level we are meeting little, if any, resistance to the changes from individual NUT members. Rather the reverse, in fact: most seem to actively welcome changes that make their working life better.\" </p> <p>The NUT's opposition to the agreement is founded on the suspicion that the reforms will open the way for untrained teaching staff to take over teachers' roles. It is not a view shared by the other unions, which believe the agreement entrenches teachers' professional standing, but it is one that is sincerely held. And union officials admit there is a tension in how a moral position taken at a national level plays out at grassroots level. </p> <p>\"We have to accept that some of our members may take a pragmatic stance over the agreement,\" says Bill Anderson, secretary of the Birmingham branch of the NUT. \"It's understandable that some teachers might prefer to have someone they know, such as a classroom assistant, to supervise classes in their absence, rather than a complete stranger. But it's important the union continues to make a stand: we feel that the increased roles of higher-level teaching assistants [HLTAs] and cover supervisors are the thin end of the wedge.\" </p> <p>But what if the reforms are not the thin end of the wedge, but the wedge itself? \"It would be nice to think that was the case,\" he continues. \"If we're not careful, remodelling could end with classes taught and assessed by software packages.\" </p> <p>That is some way off yet, but the NUT's fears that schools may use more unqualified staff will not have been eased by a report from Select Education, the largest teaching supply agency, published last week. This revealed that schools are employing increasing numbers of unqualified staff to fill gaps left by a shortage of teachers, and that the new limits on the hours teachers can work have forced schools to hire hundreds of classroom assistants to oversee pupils. </p> <p>There is no argument over the formalisation of the career structure and the pay and conditions of support staff, and all unions welcomed the government's proposals last week to ensure that contracted-out support staff enjoy similar benefits to LEA employees. The real argument is over their roles, though curiously the Birmingham pay agreement for support staff, the first to be agreed at LEA level, may in effect undermine the position of HLTAs. </p> <p>Under the terms of the Birmingham agreement, HLTAs can earn a maximum of \u00a322,689, while the starting salary for newly qualified teachers is just \u00a318,558. Although teachers can go on to out-earn HLTAs within three years, this disparity is just the sort of thing that should get up the nose of the NUT; in fact, it plays into their hands. \"Why on earth would a head want to pay that much for an HLTA when they can employ a fully qualified teacher for less?\" says Anderson. \"It just doesn't make sense.\" </p> <p>No one expects the arguments to become any less heated over the next few years as the reforms are put into practice. Collarbone just hopes that things can keep going at a similar pace, and will be more than satisfied if the NRT can be disbanded in 18 months' time with as little fuss as it was created. But there are concerns, and these tend to centre on fears that the hard-won gains of the first year will be gradually eroded as more and more new reforms become statutory practice in school. </p> <p>\"I haven't noticed any slippage since the introduction of PPA,\" says Jones, \"but it's certainly something I am looking out for.\" She then pulls out a paper hanky to mop up some coffee she has spilt on her desk. I ask: isn't that a waste of your time? Wouldn't you be better off getting a member of the support staff to do that for you? </p> <p>She fixes me with a smile. \"Some changes take longer than others to bed in.\" </p> <p><strong>Additional reporting by Nigel Burnham</strong> </p> <p><strong>Timetable of change</strong></p> <p><strong>Phase one: September 2003</strong> <br> Twenty-four administrative tasks delegated from teachers to support staff. A \"reasonable\" work-life balance to take account of health and welfare. Teaching timetables to allow for leadership and management responsibilities. </p> <p><strong>Phase two: September 2004</strong><br> Covering for absent colleagues to be limited to 38 hours a year, with eventual aim of reducing still further. </p> <p><strong>Phase three: September 2005</strong><br> Guaranteed time for planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) of at least 10% of timetabled hours. The agreement confirms that this cannot be encroached upon by other duties. Teachers should not be required to invigilate external exams. </p> <p><strong>Plus: </strong> reduction in paperwork; more support staff, including higher-level teaching assistants, cover supervisors and technical support staff; recruitment of managers from outside education to school leadership teams. </p> <p> <strong>Source:</strong> DfES</p>",
  "<p>Nearly three quarters of last year's graduates have already found employment, with just 6.2% unemployed six months after leaving university, according to figures published today.</p> <p>The Higher Education Statistics Agency said almost a quarter (24.2%) of those who left in 2002/03 were combining work and further study. The median salary for graduates was \u00a317,000 but this covered a wide range of earnings from \u00a340,000-plus to less than \u00a35,000. </p> <p>Employment rates varied according to courses, with 92% of medicine and dentistry graduates having found work and only 0.2% assumed to be unemployed. </p> <p>For subjects allied to medicine the figure was 85.6% and education 85%. This was in contrast to law where only 46% went straight into employment but the proportion doing further study was one of the highest at 53.8%. In maths and physical sciences it was also common for graduates to do further study with about a third doing so.</p> <p>Computer science showed the highest percentage of leavers unemployed (12.5%) followed by engineering and technology (10.5%) and creative arts and design (10.3%).</p> <p>While the biggest group of male leavers went into professional occupations, followed by associate professional and technical jobs, the proportions were reversed for women, although because there were more female graduates - 34,720 compared to 22,445 men - in this sector there were actually more women than men entering the professions that year. The education sector employed the most leavers in professional occupations, with health and social work the biggest category in the associate professional group.</p> <p>The destinations of leavers from higher education (DLHE) survey allows graduates to report more than one category - employment and study for instance - unlike the first destinations supplement (FDS) and Hesa warned it was difficult to make comparisons to previous data collections.</p> <p>The number of graduates in part-time work was smaller than those working full-time but their salaries were often higher, with a median figure of \u00a323,000.</p>",
  "<p>It is a very hot afternoon, and a dozen or so kids are crammed into a small classroom, sitting on broken wooden desks covered with copies of the Qur'an. The room is dark. The small windows have no glass - they have all been shattered in the fighting. Funny shadows form on the boys' faces. </p> <p>As if staged by a light designer, the sun's rays fall on the object of the children's study, forming a perfect pool of light in the darkness of the room. In the centre of the pool, a boy lies on his back on a desk. The teacher, a tall, thin young man, stands behind him, points at his head and says: \"We shall put the dead man's head towards Mecca, and his feet should be like this.\" </p> <p>The boy's face is emotionless. He breathes very slowly, concentrating intently on his performance as a dead man in this Qur'anic classroom in one of the many madrasas sprawling in the Shia slums of Sadr city. The Jana (or Heaven) madrasa, an ugly building of brown brick walls and cement floors, is only 50 meters away from were the Mahdi army fires its mortar rounds. Until a few months ago it was a state-run school, but now it is part of the al-Sadr League for Qur'anic schools. </p> <p>The teacher goes on about what Muslims should do to prepare someone for burial. \"We should also make sure that he says the shahada [declaration of faith] but if he is unable to do it we should do it ourselves for him. We should say the words of shahada in his ears in a clear way for him.\" </p> <p>The boys are by now convinced that their friend was dead, because he had stopped breathing at all. </p> <p>\"Now, can any one of you tell me what do we mean by 'clear for him',\" asks the teacher. </p> <p>Silence. </p> <p>He answers himself: \"That we should make sure that he can understand what we say.\" </p> <p>\"Sir, what if he is a foreigner?\" asks one of the little boys. </p> <p>\"Then speak to him in his language.\" </p> <p>\"But I don't speak English, sir.\" </p> <p>\"Then do it by hands.\" </p> <p>Now all the kids roll up their eyes, trying to see what is the hand-word equivalent for \"God, who wasn't born and didn't yield a son.\" </p> <p>The scenes are always the same in these madrasas. A dozen or so kids squeezing their faces to extract as much piety as they can, listening to a young man with some threads of black hair springing out from his chin or a young girl wrapped in layers of black (the boys and girls are in separate classes). </p> <p>Islam and the society; how to pray; how to perform the burial rituals on a dying man you came across while shopping in the souq. These are not the only classes that the kids take. They are also taught how Moqtada al-Sadr is the continuation of the shia saints, how America and the Iraqi government are trying to oppress them by denying Moqtada al-Sadr the right to form his own militia. </p> <p>If there is a major incursion by the Americans the classes will stop, because most of the teachers - religious students themselves - will rush off with their RPG launchers and machine guns to the fighting in the streets. </p> <p>The walls of the classes are decorated with posters showing Moqtada's fuzzy-bearded face, all kinds of burning American armour in the background. Some display pictures of the teachers who fell in the street fighting, the martyrs. </p> <p>In another madrasa, one of the biggest in Sadr city, the schoolmaster is a chubby man dressed in black who I have met many times, either running with an RPG launcher on his shoulders or fiddling with wires in the middle of a road, preparing to detonate a mine. He says the madrasas help the kids in these huge slums. They stop them becoming street waifs. </p> <p>\"We teach them the Qur'an and the teachings of the shia imams. This will help them in this critical age to form a stable life for themselves in the future.\" </p> <p>\"From religion comes all knowledge,\" the schoolmaster adds while fiddling with his beard. </p> <p>In one of the classes a young man wearing flip-flops and pyjamas, stands in front of the blackboard. His arms are covered with a black greasy layer of dirt. The classroom is exceptionally filthy, even by the standards of the slums. The teacher looks at the boys and says: \"Today I am going to talk to you about how it is a duty in our religion to be clean.\"</p>",
  "Bryan Wilson, who has died aged 78 after a heart attack, was a renowned sociologist of religion who, as well as analysing the growth and influence of sects, examined and explained the secularisation of societies in which established religions are losing their social significance. <p>Wilson's lifelong interest in sects and new religious movements (NRMs) started in his student days. His PhD, researched at the London School of Economics, was a thesis on three Christian groups, the Christadelphians, Elim Pentacostals and Christian Scientists. This was developed into his book, Sects And Society (1961), much praised for its innovative approach. </p> <p>Wilson's agnosticism did not prevent him from defending new - and sometimes controversial - religious movements, quite simply on the basis of his own commitment to freedom of religion and justice. </p> <p>He was a strong proponent of secularisation; and had long argued that eventually, for all its proclaimed interest in faith, the US would ultimately become as secularised as western Europe. </p> <p>Wilson is credited by his fellow sociologists of religion for the clarity he brought to their ongoing debate about the rise of secularisation. He distinguished between a decline in religious belief and practice (individual secularisation) and an erosion of religious influence on social behaviour and culture (societal secularisation). </p> <p>Wilson was born in Leeds and went to school there. After national service in the army, he did undergraduate work at University College, Leicester, (as it then was) and got a first-class honours degree in economics from the University of London in 1952. He did post doctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, became a lecturer in sociology at the University of Leeds (1955-62), and then spent the rest of his career at the University of Oxford, where he was reader in sociology. </p> <p>For 30 years, until his retirement in 1993, he was a fellow of All Souls College, which became his home. He served as sub-warden (1988-90) and domestic bursar (1989-93), and devised its admired visiting fellowship programme. This allowed academics, from the UK and abroad, to live and to work in symbiosis with their peers, temporarily protected from teaching and committee work at their own universities. </p> <p>Though Wilson had a wide trawl of research interests - he published work on such topics as education, youth culture, values, equality and rationality - his core theme was secularisation. </p> <p>In two books, Contemporary Transformations Of Religion (1976) and Religion In Sociological Perspective (1982), he analysed the loss of impact of institutionalised religion on the other social sub-systems. He pointed out that the economy, the polity, law, education, art and the family function independently of religious values, norms and practices. Searching for an explanation for this, he cited changes in society due to processes of rationalisation and societalisation. </p> <p>As Wilson saw it, in the organised world, \"personal virtue, as distinguished from role obligations, is of small consequence\"; in such a system, control is no longer based on morals and religion: it has become impersonal - legal, technical, mechanised and computerised - thus, religion has lost one of its important latent functions. </p> <p>He argued that \"secularisation is also a concomitant of societalisation\"; and that religion can only survive in the context of a community. However, this did not mean that religion will disappear; he maintained that it could survive in the private, personal realm, which is based on our primary relations with each other. </p> <p>The study of sectarian movements and NRMs was a prominent aspect of Wilson's scholarship. He elaborated his model of the religious sect, and identified a number of sub-types based on the way sects defined evil, and the routes their adherents could take to reach salvation. </p> <p>This gave rise to Religious Sects (1970); but Wilson also explored millennial ideas in Magic And The Millennium (1973), and investigated the future of charisma in The Noble Savage (1975). Later, he studied NRMs - among others, the Moonies and Scientologists, but never lost interest in the \"old sects\" such as the Exclusive Brethren and Jehovah's Witnesses. </p> <p>With myself, he co-authored A Time To Chant (1994), a pioneering study of Soka Gakkai, a lay Buddhist association, in the UK. Adapted to the consumer society, NRMs offer \"salvation\" in this world \"through supernatural and often esoteric or occult means\". He concluded that their members are seeking a way to be successful in this world, to be assertive, and to be able to build up sustained relationships. </p> <p>Although a rather private individual, he became president of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion (1971-75), and guided it through its transformation from a Catholic into a non-denominational, truly international and scholarly association. </p> <p>Wilson was not only a brilliant scientist who combined empirical research with theoretical insights, he was also a gifted teacher. He not only taught his students sociology, but inculcated in them those social values that need to be preserved. </p> <p>He knew that teaching is a calling that implies being rather than doing, and built sustained relationships with his students all over the world. What is more, as a master of elegant prose himself, he helped them to discover knowledge and showed them how to present the results of their research. </p> <p>Wilson's academic honours included a D Litt from the University of Oxford (1984), an Hon D Litt from Soka University (1985) and a Doctorate Honoris Causa from the Catholic University of Leuven, in Belgium (1992). He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1994. </p> <p>He never married. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Bryan Robert Wilson, sociologist and academic, born June 25 1926; died October 9 2004</p>",
  "<p>The government's draft mental health bill poses worrying implications for carers. The bill, currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny, will greatly extend the forcible treatment of people with mental disorders. At the same time it would strip carers of significant rights to challenge the detention or compulsory treatment of a mentally disordered loved one. </p> <p>Under the Mental Health Act 1983 nearest relatives have the right to apply for compulsory admission, to be consulted over the use of compulsory powers, and have the power to object to detention for treatment. They also have the right to discharge a patient who is not dangerous to themselves or to others. If a psychiatrist moves to block discharge, the nearest relative can then apply to a mental health review tribunal for the issue of danger to self or others to be independently determined. </p> <p>The 1983 act allows the family to take responsibility for the health needs of their loved one, but the state is entitled to take over if they are likely to act in a manner dangerous to self or to others. A nearest relative who objects unreasonably to detention, or exercises their power of discharge unreasonably can be displaced by the county court.</p> <p>The draft bill was conceived in an atmosphere of dissatisfaction about the process of appointing and displacing the nearest relative. In the case of JT v United Kingdom (2000), the European court of human rights held that it was a breach of the right of respect for privacy that JT had no right to displace her mother as nearest relative when she was living with a man who had abused JT. </p> <p>This could have been resolved by a simple amendment of the 1983 act entitling the patient to seek displacement of an unsuitable nearest relative. </p> <p>But the bill would scrap the role of the nearest relative and replace it with the nominated person, who would have significantly fewer rights. The nearest relative would no longer be allowed to object to compulsory treatment nor to sanction the discharge of a patient not dangerous to themselves or others. </p> <p>While under the 1983 act the carer will almost always be the nearest relative, the carer will not necessarily be the nominated person. The state is seeking to wrest back control from the private family arena by replacing the robust nearest relative concept with two figures possessing much diluted powers. </p> <p>The first is the nominated person, who has the right to be consulted about the wishes and feelings of the patient, and the right to apply to the tribunal for discharge or transfer. There is no power to apply for the discharge of a patient who is not dangerous to self or to others. The nominated person will normally be appointed only after the patient has been made liable to compulsory assessment for 28 days, very much a case of too little too late in the process. </p> <p>The second is the carer. Unlike the nominated person, the carer must be consulted prior to the use of the bill's compulsory powers. But the carer does not have an automatic right to be consulted - this will be left to the discretion of the approved mental health professional (AMHP). Even then the consultation is limited to expressing the wishes and feelings of the patient. The right to challenge the use of compulsory powers at an early stage will be effectively removed, and even the limited right to be consulted is subject to the discretionary power of the AMHP.</p> <p>This prompts the question whether carers who challenge compulsion will fall foul of this discretionary power not to consult them, or not to appoint them as the nominated person. Seeking patients' views about the appropriate person to uphold their rights when they are deemed ill enough to be considered for compulsion is fraught with pitfalls. Although a patient might be deemed capable they may experience temporary hostility to their carer or skewing of their judgement. AMHPs will find themselves having to make judgements about families in more haste than is desirable.</p> <p>How does the bill see carers? In a certain way it sees them as unpaid members of the care team. A controversial aspect of the bill is the provision that patients in the community may be required, by their clinical supervisor or the mental health tribunal, to desist from any specified conduct. It will be all too easy to persuade carers to take on the role of enforcing conduct conditions, if this will result in their loved ones avoiding detention in hospital. </p> <p>If carers find themselves having to exercise a policing role in order to ensure compliance on the part of their loved one, this would introduce yet another pressure into an already difficult caring role. This bill is no friend of the army of carers who prop up the creaking mental health service.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Victoria Yeates is a senior lecturer at the University of Glamorgan</p>"
