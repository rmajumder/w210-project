  "I'm writing from California, where the presidential election is mainly a rumour, fed by cable news. Poor souls, we see only the barrage of television ads that now constitute the bulk of a modern campaign when they're excerpted on the news broadcasts - which they increasingly are. In one of this campaign's novel twists, many adverts are now made only to be 'released' to the internet in the hope of garnering free news coverage. <p>In the 1950s, fear-mongering critics foresaw a dystopian future in which political leaders would be 'sold like soap'. They were risibly wrong. Soap advertising rarely stoops to the level on which American political advertising, with its creepy background music, grotesque slo-mo footage and fear-inducing voice-over announcers, lives. </p> <p>California is on the outside looking in because this state is overwhelmingly pro-Kerry. The polls say so. And so we suffer our lack of inundation, due to this odd confluence of a political antique and the latest technology. The antique is the Electoral College, which distributes votes for president state-by-state, and its accompanying state legislation which, with a couple of exceptions, apportions those votes on a winner-take-all basis. The latest technology, gleaned from advertising, dictates that you focus only on likely prospects. In California, long since relegated to the Kerry column, there are none. A California Bush voter is, in effect, a wasted Bush voter. So for us, as for you, this excruciating year has been, aside from the fundraising, mainly a spectator sport. </p> <p>The local newspaper printed an opinion piece last Sunday about the man whom a recent book identified as 'Bush's Brain', Karl Rove. Liberal writer Neal Gabler offered the most dire interpretation of Rove's baleful influence on politics - even calling him, at one point, Machiavellian. Well, excuse the hell out of me. I thought this was a contest about life-and-death issues, the war, global warming, the future of the world's most conventionally powerful nation - you know, stuff like that. If you really wanted to win such a campaign, gosh, maybe you'd even like the operation to be run by someone Machiavellian. After all, if the toilet stops up, I call the plumber. </p> <p>Liberals, of the Hollywood variety particularly, evince the most exquisite dismay at the ruthless and unethical behaviour of the likes of Rove. Then they go back to chuckling indulgently at the less ethical, and less explicable, behaviour of the often-feral agents and producers in their own midst. At least Rove has the good manners not to behave like a spoilt three-year-old who's been kept up two hours past his bedtime. </p> <p>Democrats generally revel in the conceit that they're smarter than their opponents, while Republicans assure themselves they're more moral than the other guys. But, Bush is not the idiot liberals like to think. He's got a kind of reptilian cunning, and Rove taps right into that political lizard brain. Combined with fervid Methodism, you've got ruthless certainty. Bush also has excellent speech writers, and knows how to stick to the script. </p> <p>Kerry's way of vaulting over the threshold issue - are you tough enough? - has been to proffer his Vietnam resum\u00e9. When it was savaged by the Swift Boats for Truth ads, he spent the first three weeks of August not defending his own military record. When asked about this strategy, Kerry said his advisers wouldn't let him. </p> <p>The senator also has his own savant, a seven-time loser (in presidential campaigns) named Robert Shrum. His signature is a sort of throwback populism. In a recent New York Times Magazine article, Shrum was asked why the Kerry campaign was ignoring the centrepiece of his Senate career, a tough investigation that led to the closing down of BCCI, an international bank with drug cartel and - how's this for relevance? - terrorism connections. Shrum's answer: it's too complex for 'them'. Populism in action. So, Kerry's senatorial life is a self-defined black hole. Fortunately for him, there are no Machiavellians around to define it in more sinister terms. </p> <p>Bill Clinton has been brought in to 'make the sale' for Kerry. Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing similar last-minute work for Bush. How do you like your testosterone: straight, or mixed with steroids? </p> <p>One can excuse the still undecided for thinking this election boils down to a simple question: after the funeral, whom would you rather hang out with, the preacher or the mortician? </p> <p>For me, it's also a simple question. Bush has run a disastrous war. Kerry has run a feckless campaign. On Tuesday, the American people can punish only one of them. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Actor and writer Harry Shearer voices Mr Burns and Smithers, among others, in The Simpsons.

  "<b>ABORTION</b> <br> <b>Countdown starts for Roe v Wade</b> <p>Dorothy Fadiman was a graduate student at Stanford University when she became pregnant, and begged her gynaecologist for an abortion. When he said he couldn't do it, she 'found a branch of the Mafia, paid someone $600 cash, and had a blindfolded, unanaesthetised abortion from a stranger'. The operation went so badly that, she remembers, 'the same gynaecologist who would not give me a safe abortion came to the intensive care ward and saved my life'. </p> <p>The year was 1961. In 1973, in the landmark Supreme Court ruling known as Roe v Wade, abortion was made legal in the US. It is now estimated that about one in three American women will have had an abortion by the age of 45. But the ability of individual states to impose restrictions on women's access to safe abortions has been gradually expanded since 1973. </p> <p>Now more than half the 50 states require parental notification for minors, and many states impose a waiting period and restrict public funding or insurance coverage - a situation which means that, in the words of one clinic director in Alabama, 'for young women and poor women, the desperation is already here'. Because they receive federal funds, US military hospitals abroad are not allowed to perform abortions on servicewomen or the wives of servicemen. </p> <p>Roe v Wade is currently upheld in the Supreme Court by a slim margin of 5-4. Since it is one of the longest-serving Supreme Courts in US history, the next President is expected to appoint one or more Supreme Court justices. Depending on who they are, and who retires, a woman's right to choose may be severely threatened. George Bush has said he is not in favour of a 'litmus test' which would force a judge to outline his or her position on abortion beforehand. John Kerry stands by the constitutional right to choose, and has outraged his fellow Roman Catholics by stating that the decision is 'between a woman, God and her doctor'. </p> <p>The hottest topic due to appear before the Supreme Court on this issue is the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. It was first introduced in 1995, vetoed by President Clinton, and recently passed into law by President Bush. Three district judges declared the ban unconstitutional, and it is now on appeal. </p> <p>The ban refers to a procedure dubbed 'partial-birth abortion' by anti-abortionists. Medically termed 'dilation and extraction' (D&amp;X), it involves partially delivering a second-trimester foetus before puncturing the skull and suctioning the contents before final delivery. It is used very rarely, but because of its apparent brutality the pro-life movement has found an emotional argument. 'From a PR standpoint, it's a winning issue for them,' says Steven Emmert, of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. 'When they created the term \"partial-birth abortion\" they won the PR war.' </p> <p>'D&amp;X' first came to national attention in 1992, when Dr Martin Haskell, a physician in Cincinnati, Ohio, gave a paper on it. He and other doctors had begun to use the procedure when aborting foetuses with severe birth defects (undetected before 20 weeks), because doctors needed an 'intact' foetus to be able to advise parents whether future children were at risk. </p> <p>The banning of a specific procedure is unprecedented but, as Carol Tobias, political director of the National Right to Life Committee, puts it, 'we think if we want to protect unborn children we have to take it one step at a time'. </p> <p>Though there may now seem little to defend about D&amp;X as opposed to other methods, the ban is seen by the pro-choice movement as a symbolic step towards overturning Roe v Wade. 'It's not about a particular procedure,' says Emmert, 'it's about turning the public against abortion in general. And it's working: the frightening thing is, when we look at polling numbers, increasingly young women who have not lived through the days before Roe are more apt to say they are anti-choice.' Tobias says that overturning Roe v Wade 'will take a few years, but I certainly think it's possible'. </p> <p>Susan Cohen, director of Government Affairs at the Alan Guttmacher Institute in Washington, formerly part of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, believes that a Bush win means 'we can anticipate more federal legislation restricting various aspects of access to abortion'. </p> <p>One of these is the Child Custody Protection Act. If passed, it would mean that, if a minor who lived in a state requiring parental consent crossed state lines to have an abortion in one that didn't, whoever accompanied her - friend, boyfriend, grandmother - could be jailed. In some states abortion clinic staff face daily aggressive protests. Since 1977 there have been seven murders, 166 arson attacks and 1,042 acts of vandalism at clinics. </p> <p>Dorothy Fadiman is now a 65-year-old maker of documentaries. She is married, has children, and has been nominated for an Oscar for a film she made about abortion. In the run-up to this election, she has been touring colleges in swing states, trying to keep young women informed. 'It's the stealth nature of the effort. Under the radar screen, they've been whittling away at all these rights. Now the liberals are saying, \"Where were we? Asleep at the wheel?\".' </p> <p><b>Gaby Wood</b></p> <p><b>JOBS</b> <br><b>Mixed messages in the Rust Belt</b></p> <p>It is called the Rust Belt and it extends in a wide arc across the north-east of America, from Buffalo in upstate New York to the car capital of Detroit hundreds of miles away in Michigan. </p> <p>It is a land of emptying factories and job losses. It should be safe Democratic territory. But in America's divided election of 2004, few things are simple and the issue of jobs is no exception. </p> <p>The Rust Belt runs across several key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. All have suffered job losses. For some, voting for John Kerry is as natural as breathing. John Abdalla, chairman of the Democratic Party in Ohio's Jefferson County, says jobs are the key issue in his corner of the most vital swing state in the election. 'We just cannot stand any more of this,' he said. </p> <p>Jefferson County lies alongside the Ohio river valley and is full of towns that rely on the huge steel mills that dot its banks. But many are running on much reduced capacity. Some have closed. Joseph Brem used to work in one of them. But its workforce has been slashed, and his healthcare benefits have been lost. Now he is volunteering for Kerry's campaign. 'I will do whatever it takes to beat Bush,' Brem said. </p> <p>Brem said everyone in his hometown of Steubenville has a story about the decline of the mills. Their legacy is obvious. Huge murals celebrating the steel industry are painted on the sides of buildings on the town's main street. The hulking mill complex dominates the town, as do the scarred hills above it, decimated by decades of mining. </p> <p>Justice Smith pointed to the mill. 'This is a steel town. Both my grandfathers spent 40 years in that mill,' he said. 'Steel is everything here.' </p> <p>But there are other economic trends afoot. Smith lives in Steubenville, but works in nearby Pittsburgh as an advertising executive. New jobs have arrived in the Rust Belt. </p> <p>In fact, the traditional political orthodoxy - that job losses equals a boost for Democrats - has not held true in 2004. In Ohio, which has lost almost a quarter of a million jobs in the past four years, the race is still tight. The same is true in Michigan, where factory closures and layoffs have not yet put the state firmly in the Democratic camp. Bush is still campaigning hard and has the state firmly in his sights as winnable. </p> <p>Yet the situation is reversed in Florida. There the economy is booming and producing more jobs than anywhere else in the country. In the past 12 months, 125,000 new jobs were created. Bush won the state last time by a razor-thin, and fiercely disputed, margin of just over 500 votes. But this time round, Bush has failed to capitalise on the boom. The state could still vote for Kerry. </p> <p>There are two factors that confuse the picture. The first is that terrorism and the war in Iraq has trumped jobs as the main issue in the Rust Belt and elsewhere. </p> <p>David Griffey is a life-long Ohio steelworker, the son of a retired union president and a registered Democrat. Yet last week he attended a Bush rally in Youngstown, Ohio, and said he was voting for the President. 'Bush is trying to create peace around the world. The mistakes in Iraq are from the military. You can't blame the President for them,' he said. In Florida, that situation is reversed. The state is home to many veterans and families of soldiers. Many have turned against the war and will be supporting Kerry. </p> <p>The other factor is the economy itself. It has painted a confusing picture that has allowed both candidates to pick and choose what they want. Kerry has slammed the job losses and pointed to the fact that Bush is the first President since the 1930s to preside over a net loss of jobs. But the Republicans point to a low unemployment rate that matches the levels of the boom during the era of Bill Clinton. They also say that economic growth is healthy. </p> <p>That allows George Bush relentlessly to use the same stump speech phrase at rally after rally. 'The economy is strong and getting stronger,' he says. </p> <p><b>Paul Harris</b></p> <p><b>SECURITY</b> <br><b>Military's poll paradox</b></p> <p>Steven McHugh never planned a career in the military. But after al-Qaeda launched its attacks on 11 September, the 22-year-old from New Jersey told his mother that he believed it was the defining moment of his generation. So McHugh volunteered to fight those responsible. </p> <p>But where the army took McHugh was not to the war against Osama bin Laden, but Iraq. When he returned on leave to New Jersey in July his mother Mildred was shocked how her son had been changed in six months based near the city of Samarra. </p> <p>'He seemed like a different person. He had lost his best friend in his unit. He said that he had seen some terrible stuff. He was incredibly jumpy, looking at cars all the time as if they be a threat and dropping to his knees if he heard a loud noise.' </p> <p>What makes Mildred angry is that she believes her son's sense of idealism and duty was betrayed. Steven was sent to fight the wrong war. </p> <p>The result has been that for the first time in her life, the 44-year-old has started going to demonstrations. She says if the US electorate returns George Bush as President this week she is not certain how to deal with her disappointment with her fellow Americans. </p> <p>And for those like Mildred and her son, the appearance of the bin Laden tape has confronted them with the central paradox of this election: if security is the big issue, then how is it that after so many American deaths, the self-declared nemesis of the US is still free to taunt them? </p> <p>It is this question that has separated the two candidates' rhetoric most bitterly, as John Kerry has repeated again and again on the stump that he would have done it differently and concentrated his efforts on bin Laden. Bush, meanwhile, has accused Kerry of being inconsistent in his record of voting as a Senator on terror issues. </p> <p>Which leaves the question: would a Kerry presidency be any more effective in confronting the problems in Iraq or the elusive bin Laden? </p> <p>It is a moot point. In a speech in February in Los Angeles, Kerry articulated his vision for a new direction on the war on terror while admitting that the US was still committed to finishing the job in Iraq. </p> <p>On the fight against al-Qaeda, his proposals often appear as much a change of style and management skills as a grand departure into new territory, diplomacy and international consensus. </p> <p>Where Kerry does differ, though, is in dealing with issues around the problem - insisting on the need for a tougher line on money flowing through Saudi Arabia and a campaign of 'naming and shaming' those involved in financing terrorism. </p> <p>'The fight requires us to use every tool at our disposal,' Kerry said then. 'Not only a strong military - but renewed alliances, vigorous law enforcement, reliable intelligence and unremitting efforts to shut down the flow of terrorist funds. </p> <p>'To do this demands that we work with other countries instead of walking alone. For today the agents of terrorism work and lurk in the shadows of 60 nations on every continent. In this entangled world, we need to build real and enduring alliances. </p> <p>'Allies give us more hands in the struggle, but no President would ever let them tie our hands and prevent us from doing what must be done.' </p> <p>Among those unimpressed by either of the candidates' approach to the threat of al-Qaeda or Iraq is Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser in the Carter administration. </p> <p>Writing in the New York Times last week, he noted acerbically: 'Both candidates have become prisoners of a worldview that fundamentally misdiagnoses the central challenge of our time. President Bush's \"global war on terror\" is a politically expedient slogan without real substance... The predicament faced by America in Iraq is more complex than the solutions offered so far by the Democratic side in the presidential contest.' </p> <p>If one thing is certain, it is that whoever wins the election, soldiers such as Steven McHugh will still be fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p><b>Peter Beaumont</b></p> <p><b>SUPREME COURT</b><br><b>Tipping the balance</b></p> <p>With moral and cultural issues playing as large a role in influencing Tuesday's presidential election as security, money and war, the question over the future make-up of the US Supreme Court is the issue that neither candidate has wished to fully acknowledge. </p> <p>Beyond the prospect that disputed results in many states could once again put the outcome of the election in the hands of nine ageing justices, the next president is almost certain to have the power to affect the ideological balance of the court, which often divides five to four on controversial issues. </p> <p>With America's moral and cultural armies squaring off over gay marriage, stem-cell research and abortion, the power to appoint one or more new justices to the ideologically divided court is perhaps more important in the long term than who sits in the White House. </p> <p>Last week, the issue came into focus when it was announced the court's 80-year-old chief justice, William Rehnquist, was being treated for thyroid cancer. Rehnquist, an ideological conservative who has presided over the court for 17 years and who has seen the country move to the right since he was appointed by Nixon, is said to be ready for work next week in case there are election issues to resolve. </p> <p>But Rehnquist's illness placed both sides of America's cultural divide on notice. Three other justices have already been treated for cancer, and with all but one over the age of 65, the court is fast approaching a changing of the guard that makes the outcome of Tuesday's vote all the more important. </p> <p>It's 10 years since the last justice was confirmed; not since 1812-23 has it gone that long unchanged. Indeed, some commentators fear Kerry's first or Bush's second term could be dominated by nomination battles. </p> <p>Democrats see the court as dominated five to four by conservatives; Republicans see it as evenly split. Any change in the make-up could tip it further either way. </p> <p>'This election is not just about the next four years but the next 40,' says Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice. 'The new president or the re-elected president will have huge control over the future direction of the court.' </p> <p>Democrats fear that if Bush is reelected, he will follow a familiar pattern of judicial appointment. 'Ideology has triumphed qualification in Bush's judicial selections,' says Aron. 'He's looked for young ideologues with fixed hostilities toward civil rights, environmental and consumer protections and a woman's right to choose.' </p> <p>Despite his faith, Kerry has vowed he will not nominate a judge who does not support abortion rights. Bush, somewhat opaquely, says he'll name 'judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law'. </p> <p>Under a Bush second term Democrats fear a conservative could be selected to replace liberal John Paul Stevens, 84. And conservative groups fear a liberal successor to Rehnquist or to the committed conservative Antonin Scalia. </p> <p>'I don't think it is too much to say that the culture may well hang in the balance with the appointment of Supreme Court justices in the coming years,' says Tony Perkins, president of the socially conservative Family Research Council. </p> <p>As an original opponent of abortion rights and supporter of invading neutral Cambodia in the early 1970s, Rehnquist has been a soldier for the right, helping to deliver the 2000 election to Bush, weakening the barrier between church and state, restricting the criminal appeals process and the reach of affirmative action, as well as reducing the power of Washington to dictate to the states. </p> <p>During this election the court has already made itself felt. Two weeks ago, it refused to hear an appeal by independent candidate Ralph Nader, against a lower-court ruling that kept him off the Pennsylvania ballot. And last week, Clinton appointee Justice Stephen Breyer admitted he wasn't sure he was being truly impartial when he voted against a recount in Florida in 2000 and thus gave Bush the White House. </p> <p>Still, there is little doubt that when Americans go to the polls next week, they will be voting on issues that will ultimately end up before the Supreme Court. Eleven state ballots, including four crucial swing states, carry an amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. </p> <p>It's the issue beyond others that has energised Christian evangelicals and other social conservatives. In Ohio, where polls are dead even, the Ohio Campaign to Protect Marriage claims to have registered 55,000 new voters on the strength of feeling over the issue. Both sides of the marriage debate say it could be the issue that swings the state, and potentially the election. </p> <p>And even if the election results do not end up before the court, it is likely that key national issues will be before it again in the near future. 'All you need is the retirement of one or two justices and rulings on abortion, affirmative action, gay rights and the death penalty can be in play again,' says John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley. </p> <p>At the same time, scaremongering by both sides is rampant as both candidates try to motivate their bases. 'It's too big a leap to think all the big decisions of the last 30 years could be reversed,' says Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution. 'Everything is carried to extreme in these last couple of days.'</p> <p><b>Ed Helmore</b></p> <p><b>They said what?</b></p> <p>'Too many good docs are getting out of the business.

  "<b>If Bush wins...</b> <p>Bush is unlikely to move too quickly if elected for a second term. </p> <p>The initial focus of a second administration will continue to be Iraq. </p> <p>The long-delayed assault by American and Iraqi troops to take Fallujah is widely expected and possibly attacks on other towns, such as Ramadi.</p> <p>Bush has several domestic policy goals that he will move to fulfil. These will include moves to make his first-term tax cuts permanent.</p> <p>Some critics believe that further reform of America's tax code might include taking a look at replacing income tax with a sales tax.</p> <p>The President also wants to press ahead with the semi-privatisation of social security. However, both these plans could be too radical for any second term. Historically, two-term Presidents have been more moderate in their second period in the White House.</p> <p>Also likely to push for another energy bill, which may enrage the environmental lobby again trying to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, after his first attempt failed to make it into law.</p> <p>Has promised to try again to cap damages in medical malpractice suits.</p> <p>Likely to have to make several Supreme Court appointments and may please his conservative base by naming anti-abortion justices, thus paving the way for a second-term challenge to America's abortion laws.</p> <p> <b>If Kerry wins...</b></p> <p>He has sworn to make winning wider international support for the US in Iraq one of his key initial objectives. By the time Kerry takes power, the Iraqi elections will be taking place or have been suspended due to security problems.</p> <p>He has also pledged to bring his health care plan to Congress within 100 days. He has said this will be his first major attempt at new legislation.</p> <p>On taxes, Kerry will revoke the Bush tax cuts for Americans earning more than $200,000 a year. He will keep cuts affecting people earning less than that.</p> <p>He may also engage America in talks to renegotiate some of the terms of the Kyoto environmental pact and wants to set a goal for the US of eventually becoming energy independent.</p> <p>Major legislation is likely to be hampered by the expectation that Republicans will continue to control Congress. In Iraq, events on the ground will likely continue to dictate US military actions, regardless of policy in Washington.</p> <p>He will bring in fresh faces. His priority is to replace attorney-general John Ashcroft with a more moderate figure. He will also try to heal deep divisions, such as the split between the Pentagon and State Department.</p> <p>Kerry is also committed to engaging with the UN. The expected retirement of several Supreme Court judges, means he will almost certainly have to make appointments to America's ultimate legal body. He has said he will not appoint a justice who favours banning abortion.</p> <p> <b>If it is deadlock...</b></p> <p>If the election is close and boils down to a wafer-thin margin in just a handful of states, it could be lawyers who dominate the next 100 days.</p> <p>Mobile 'Swat' teams of legal eagles are ready with private jets to swoop down on any trouble spots.</p> <p>Argument over provisional ballots are likely to dominate any legal challenges.

  "Sitting on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue, the Capital Grille is where the congressmen and lawyers of the Republican Party, its business supporters, its petitioners and lobbyists, dine on 24oz porterhouse steaks, smoke Davidoff cigars and drink bottles of Haut Brion. <p>Its allure is not necessarily the food. The steaks at Morton's - more favoured by a Democratic crowd - are generally accepted to be finer. Instead, it is about atmosphere and connections, the knowledge of close proximity to the wheels of power. It is an ambience once memorably summed up by Roll Call, the Congressional weekly, as 'to hell with the have-nots'. </p> <p>The Capital Grille, with its vast slabs of marbled meat and brittle, well-groomed young women flirting with rich attorneys, says former Democratic congressman turned lobbyist Toby Moffett, is a 'real Republican place'. </p> <p>'The Capital Grille will take a financial hit if Kerry is elected,' said Moffett. 'There will just be fewer Republicans and a lot less money chasing after them.' </p> <p>In a capital and country more partisan than at any time in living memory, what happens in the polls on Tuesday will have far-reaching consequences for the competing political cultures of DC. </p> <p>And if it is not a changing of the guard that is around the corner with a Kerry victory, then it is the consolidation of a Bush Washington whose atmosphere is invidious to liberal causes. In either event, there will be change and pain. </p> <p>'If there is a change of president,' says Moffett, 'there will be some furious scrambling. It will affect thousands of people. There will be a huge turnover inside the lobbying firms, in the big associations who will want to have the right people representing them in Washington, in the corporate offices, most of which are run by Republicans.' </p> <p>A Democratic lobbyist, the head of Livingston-Moffett has found the Washington of the past four years a tough place to work. </p> <p>'I think most Democrats have suffered after Bush took power. The way these guys play the game has hurt incomes. The only thing that has saved Democratic lobbyists is the fact that, in the Senate you need 60 votes, not a straight majority.' </p> <p>A Kerry win, said Moffett, would end four years of exile for many of the liberal groups that campaign on issues from human rights to gun control who have been 'in exile' since the advent of the Bush administration. </p> <p>It is in the area of funding and 'de-funding' of pressure groups - and in their access to power - that the results of the election will be most keenly felt. </p> <p>It is a process that has been documented by New York political commentator Esther Kaplan. In her book, With God on Their Side, she details the ruthless culling of 'mainstream scientific, professional and policy organisations, whose constituencies tend to lean Democratic, [and] have been removed from influential federal advisory positions and replaced by ideologues'. </p> <p>Writes Kaplan: 'The American Medical Association no longer advises US delegates to UN summits on children's issues; Concerned Women for America does instead. Experts from the Centre for Aids Prevention Studies no longer sit on the presidential Aids advisory council; they have been replaced by a former beauty queen who lectures on abstinence.' </p> <p>It is a process, says Kaplan, that has been pursued through obscenity prosecutions, audits and Byzantine new financial reporting rules. What is without doubt is that a Kerry victory would see the renaissance of groups that have been excluded for four years. </p> <p>Four more years of Bush - it seems fair to say - would see a continuation of the relentless attrition on liberal groups and causes. </p> <p>It is not simply in the access to the levers of power that Washington faces the possibility of change, but in the psycho-geography of the capital itself and its centre of political and social gravity. It is about how Washington defines itself as a location. </p> <p>It is overwhelmingly Democratic - more than 70 per cent of DC voters are expected to vote Kerry: 'Republican Washington' is best summed up by the, wealthy Wasp suburbs of north Virginia, in particular McClean, which has come to be identified with the Bush administration. </p> <p>'In terms of political culture,' says Peter Beinart, editor of New Republic magazine, 'Washington always feels a more happening place when the Democrats are in power because they live in Washington.' </p> <p>A Kerry victory, Beinart predicts, would also be accompanied by talk of a 'Boston renaissance' following the Boston Red Sox winning the baseball World Series and the recent successes in American football of the New England Patriots. </p> <p>But the most significant change if Kerry wins is that his presidency would mark the 'end of a period of alienation from empiricism', returning Washington from faith-based policy-making. </p> <p>This theme is taken up by John Pike, head of GlobalSecurity think tank. 'What has happened is that the political culture in this town has got to the stage it can no longer differentiate between what is and what should be. In the past four years, the political conversation has deteriorated into a series of 'talking points' - party lines - where most people have no idea what they are saying.' </p> <p>It is hardly surprising. The relationship between the administration and academia is summed up by the attitude of Bush strategist, Karl Rove, when he defined the 'Democratic base' to the New Yorker as 'anyone with a doctorate'. </p> <p>But one thing is certain, and that is, whoever wins, the levers of power will at least be pulled by some different faces, even if a wholesale change doesn't happen. A Bush second term, say Washington insiders would almost certainly see Secretary of State Colin Powell leave the administration, tired after so many humiliations at the hands of the neo-conservatives. </p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, too, is believed to be keen to move on or up, and is said to have told friends that she will stay if asked to by Bush, but would really like to be Secretary for Defence. </p> <p>Before then, however, as the patrons of the Capital Grille are only too aware, there is an election to be won.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Letter of the week</strong></p> <p><strong> I want a budget trip to the settlement of Ammassalik in Greenland. Can I fly to Reykjavik with Iceland Express, and then book a cheap onward flight and accommodation?</strong><br> B. Richard, London </p> <p>Greenland is hugely pricey, but you're right: it is possible to get there via Iceland. Most tourists visit this part of Greenland, with its Inuit culture and winter sports, on day trips from Reykjavik's domestic airport to Kulusuk with Air Iceland (<a href=\"http://www.icelandair.com\">icelandair.com</a>). They run from the end of May to mid-September, and cost between \u00a3240 and \u00a3320. The trips include a tour of the town and a Greenlandic dance and kayak show. </p> <p>To visit Ammassalik, the price rises to \u00a3625, including a helicopter ride from Kulusuk to Ammassalik and two nights' stay.</p> <p><strong>We are going to St Thomas, in the US Virgin Isles, for two weeks in August. We have accommodation but no flights yet. We'd like information on how to get there and details of places to visit and things to do while we are there.</strong> </p> <p><strong>We hope to go home via New Mexico for a few days so we would welcome information on getting there from St Thomas, as well as recommendations for things to do.</strong><br> Mary Cava, by email</p> <p>A couple of elements make this trip problematic. One is flying during the summer peak season, which will make your ticket expensive.</p> <p>The other is coming back via New Mexico, which will complicate your return journey. In August, a return ticket to St Thomas via Houston with Continental Airlines costs about \u00a3850, with taxes, with Bridge the World (0870 814 4400; <a href=\"http://www.bridgetheworld.com\">bridgetheworld.com</a>). You need to add at least \u00a3200 if you include Albuquerque or Santa Fe on the way back, travelling to Houston and then via Dallas. Cheaper charter flights may be available, so shop around.</p> <p>Once on St Thomas, take your time and explore the island slowly. Charlotte Amalie is a lovely, if heavily touristic town, which attracts 900 cruise ships a year to the Caribbean's finest natural port.</p> <p>If you're feeling active, hire a bike on nearby Water Island, which is rich in military history. There are a few hiking routes, but St Thomas is mostly about lovely beaches, diving and snorkelling.

In Europe we use our own, but further afield we need to hire one. We hear that some countries have an upper-age limit for driving. Please tell us about this.</strong><br> Dorothy Olney, West Sussex </p> <p>This decision is most often taken by car-hire companies, rather than as part of national legislation. While most hire firms don't impose a standard limit, regional franchises may be forced to do so by their insurance companies.

  "<p>As any counsellor will tell you, the secret ingredient to every successful relationship comes under the rather unsexy heading of 'compromise'. But if compromise ultimately keeps the show on the road, it also means a watered-down version of what you really wanted. So the fortnight's golfing in the Algarve becomes an afternoon on the practice range; the full-size snooker table becomes, well, a new dining table. But every now and again, a compromise comes along which is better than the sum of its parts. And it's called a Boom Trike.</p> <p>The word trike, or tricycle, conjures up images of snotty-faced children and three-wheeled vicars pedalling wildly round the parish. Add an engine, shiny forks, leather seats and a red bandanna, however, and you have an entirely new proposition. Take all that's good about a two-wheeled motorbike - exhaust noise, easy-rider handlebars, the sight of the road rushing to meet you, and all that's good about a four-wheeled car - safety, stability, luggage space, comfy seats, no crash helmet, and the result of this star-blessed union is a three-wheeler with the looks of a motorbike and the personality of a sports car. </p> <p>Boom Trikes, a Germany-based company, has sold more than 6,000 vehicles since starting up in 1990. The southern UK distributor, Bulldog (<a href=\"http://www.bulldog-sv.co.uk\">bulldog-sv.co.uk</a>), is the brainchild of Mark Evans, who viewers of Discovery Channel's Bike/Car/Helicopter Is Born series will remember as the greasy-palmed, vet-turned-mechanic who gives ancient E-Types and Harley-Davidsons the kiss of life on TV.</p> <p>Bulldog offers five trikes from the Boom range, starting with the 'twist and go' Fun 500 (a scooter in disguise) to the Fighter (a 115mph, \u00a325,900 chunk of vehicular Viagra). The other three trikes are the Chopper, Low Rider and three-seater Family. The only concession the Family makes to family, however, is that it has three seats - no crash helmets, no seat belts and a top speed of 77mph probably rules it out for the school run. </p> <p>Mark was keen for me to test the Low Rider, which starts at \u00a314,500 and is, to my mind, the sexiest of the lot. There's enough black saddle leather, gleaming chrome and steel to give a minimalist architect heart palpitations. It's powered by a 1,600cc Volkswagen fuel-injected, air-cooled boxer engine, and features an ultra-low riding position which makes you feel like a cross between Dennis Hopper and a pregnant woman in stirrups. </p> <p>The trike calls for a combination of driving and riding techniques, though it can only be driven with a driver's licence. It has a handbrake, a car-style gearbox, a footbrake and foot clutch. But it also has a bike throttle and a pair of gloriously long steel handlebars. Goggles on (no helmets are required by law), I turn the ignition to be met by a heart-stopping roar from the rear-mounted engine; the second noise is a huge whoop of glee as you drop the handbrake, release the clutch and open the throttle. It's wind-in-your-hair, fists-in-the-air exhilaration. And when was the last time having to compromise felt that good?</p>",
  "<p>Britain's long-running consumer boom will come to an end in 2005 as a slowdown in the housing market forces a bout of belt-tightening, economist Roger Bootle warns today. </p> <p>In his quarterly health-check of the UK economy for accountant Deloitte and Touche, Bootle predicts that consumer spending will grow by just 1 per cent next year, the slowest pace since 1992, when the economy was in deep recession. </p> <p>He is predicting a 20 per cent decline in house prices over the next two to three years, which he believes will be a 'major determinant' of shoppers' mood. </p> <p>Other factors are helping to fuel consumer pessimism, he says. 'There are a whole number of things - the chance that taxes may have to go up; worries about pensions; general financial circumstances don't look great.' </p> <p>There is already gathering evidence that a housing market slowdown is under way: mortgage approvals slipped to their lowest level for four years in September, and the Nationwide house price index registered a 0.4 per cent decline for October, its sharpest since 2001. </p> <p>Bootle believes the resulting consumer squeeze will drag GDP growth down to 2.3 per cent next year - well below the 3 to 3.5 per cent Gordon Brown is hoping for to bring tax receipts rolling in and balance his books. </p> <p>The pessimistic assess ment comes as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee prepares to meet this week under strong pressure from business to leave interest rates unchanged for a third successive month. </p> <p>'With oil and commodity prices riding high, manufacturers have become less confident about recovery and retailers are concerned about high street activity cooling,' said Doug Godden, head of economic analysis at the CBI. 'Interest rates should be kept on hold until the economic fog has lifted.' </p> <p>The bank is widely expected to heed such warnings, and the City is betting that rates will be falling by the end of next year.</p>",
  "<p>Swashbuckling, rapier-wielding, wine-loving second-home seekers will love this 12th century chateau in the heart of the foie gras producing region of France. </p> <p>'Fourth musketeer' Charles D'Artagnan, on breaks from his amorous escapades in Paris, used to stay at Chateau d'Arricau-Bordes when it was owned by his uncle in the seventeenth century. </p> <p>Though best known as the na\u00efve hero of Alexandre Dumas's novel The Three Musketeers , the real-life D'Artagnan was born in nearby Lupiac in about 1610. </p> <p>The chateau, currently on the market, is 'one for all' - representing the ultimate second home or opportunity for a major lifestyle change. It is the oldest wine estate in the region, with the medieval buildings - which were saved from ruin in the Seventies - listed as a 'monument historique'. </p> <p>Present owner Leon Van Tongeren was an organic Highland beef farmer in Scotland before he bought Chateau d'Arricau-Bordes five years ago. The musketeer link, the attached winery and its 'fairytale' appearance were the selling points: 'Those three things made me jump in the car to have a look at it. I completely fell in love,' he says. </p> <p>Van Tongeren produces about 4,800 bottles of organic Madiran plonk a year. Because the wine is rough when young, it is kept in oak barrels for two years, and for another two to three years in the bottle before being sold for \u20ac56 a pop. 'I describe it as a \"sophisticated hobby\", although you could turn it into a business,' he says. </p> <p>The thick stone walls of this 'very cosy castle' could certainly house more than three musketeers, with six bedrooms in the main building alone. </p> <p>Reached by a grand stone stairway, there are two turrets, a balcony and tower room, plus a dining room that reflects the medieval history of the place. </p> <p>The 35-acre estate consists of guest accommodation, a swimming pool and a garden that boasts 15 types of orchids. With panoramic views of the distant Pyrenees, the setting is romantic to say the least. </p> <p>The nearest town is Pau, 12 miles away, which is known as 'la ville anglaise' locally because of its history as an English resort. British buyers will feel at home with the racecourse, golf course, and warm-water spas. </p> <p>The chateau itself has its own links with Britain, having once been owned by Sir Winston Churchill's brother-in-law. And during the Napoleonic Wars, the Duke of Wellington - withdrawing from a local battle - is thought to have taken refuge in the chateau for a few days. Luckily for him, though, the famous musketeer was no longer around. </p> <p> Knight Frank (020 7629 8171) is asking \u20ac3.25m for Chateau d'Arricau-Bordes</p>",
  "<p>Demand for elective cosmetic surgery is thriving, fed by the inner anxieties of our 'desire economy' and aided by easy access to finance. </p> <p>The UK market is expected to be worth \u00a3251 million by the end of 2004. Research by YouGov for Abbey found that about 1.5 million UK adults would consider borrowing on average \u00a34,156 to fund a better body. More worryingly, a survey in Bliss magazine found that a third of teenagers polled would spend whatever they had to for cosmetic surgery. Sainsbury's bank estimates that just under \u00a310 million of personal loans will be taken out this year for this purpose. </p> <p>Spurred on by advertising and the media's body beautiful obsession, some people will end up viewing cosmetic surgery in the same light as buying a car, television or new home. </p> <p>But more due diligence on the part of such people might have reduced the \u00a37m paid in compensation for cosmetic surgery horrors in the past 13 years. </p> <p>While there are many reputable surgeons and clinics the industry is not fully regulated and open to abuse - in spite of national standards recently introduced by the Healthcare Commission. </p> <p>The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says: 'Cosmetic surgery undertaken in appropriate circumstances can be life-changing in a beneficial way. However, if things are not right, it's likely to be at least unsatisfactory, and at worst disastrous.' </p> <p>If someone is offering cosmetic surgery faster and cheaper than elsewhere, it is usually for a reason. Too many surgeons, it seems, are still more interested in profits than patients. BAAPS adds: 'One of the classic signs is a clinic offering marketing gimmicks such as \"two-for-one\" deals - get your breasts done and we'll also do your nose - or Christmas discounts.' </p> <p>Alan Johnson of First Medical Loans, which specialises in cosmetic surgery, adds: 'We don't do easy finance, although there are many overnight outfits who do approach us and ask. Indeed, we will advise people against taking a loan if it is not financially viable.' </p> <p>If you do decide to opt for cosmetic surgery, be sure to give equal importance to financial considerations as you would to the procedure itself. </p> <p>Most major procedures cost between \u00a33,000 and \u00a36,000, and credit cards are a popular form of payment - that way you do not have to discuss what the money is for with your bank. But while surgery should be covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act (CCA) - which makes the card company and the seller liable in case of breach of contract - don't rely on it as insurance against the procedure having to be corrected. The CCA focuses on the sale of goods and doesn't appear to quantify failure of service. This, experts say, could lead to a minefield of misinterpretation. </p> <p>A good clinic will include the cost of any corrective procedure in the original fee. For example the Transform Medical Group, featured recently in Channel 5's Cosmetic Surgery Live, has a readmission policy covering clinical problems relating to surgery for up to three years after an operation. It says it won't commit to providing continuing surgery beyond that, where the original procedure has been affected by changes in lifestyle, illness or the natural ageing process. </p> <p>BAAPs say you should also beware of 'free' consultations, booking fees or non-refundable deposits. Nothing is free and if the surgery is right for you there will be no need to be locked into going ahead by cancellation penalties. Indeed, you should have the right to cancel right up to the time of anaesthetic. </p> <p>Unlike loans for many goods and services, some sort of payment protection plan may actually be of benefit, as it would cover loss of employment due to the need for further correction or additional recovery time. This might be more readily available with a personal loan from your bank or building society. </p> <p>However, if a clinic or surgeon recommends a third-party broker, you should ensure they: know the difference between financing a car and a loan for liposuction; will be discreet; and are offering flexible terms based on what is best for you and your credit rating. Beware brokers that don't ask for your permission to approach different lenders one at a time; some will scatter-gun applications to multiple institutions instead, which could leave you with a black mark against your name. Make sure any proposed funder is FSA-authorised and is providing an unsecured loan, (without, say, your house or car as collateral), and push for the option to take payment holidays, settle early and restructure the debt. </p> <p>By contrast, actually saving hard cash means you will at least have extra time to consider non-surgical alternatives, which even the most impartial surgeon is unlikely to suggest. Herbal breast enlargement supplements, such as Erdic and Perfect C Breast Enhancement still lack comprehensive scientific backing, but have plenty of women willing to sing their praises. </p> <p>The Department of Health is currently looking at a number of options for additional regulation, to ensure that the 75,000 people who paying for procedures privately every year receive the same protection as NHS patients. But when it's your body in their hands, it ultimately falls to you to make sure you are informed about your consumer rights. </p> <p><strong>Don't make a boob</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A good clinic will want to know your medical history. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Consult your GP, and/or seek a second opinion. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> As yet there are no minimum standards of training for cosmetic surgery, but surgeons must be registered with the GMC and preferably BAAPS (<a href=\"http://www.baaps.org.uk\">www.baaps.org</a>). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Look for proven experience in your chosen procedure. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Double check any advisory organisation claiming independence - some get money from clinics. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Most non-surgical procedures such as botox, chemical peels, dermal fillers and laser treatment should be carried out by a qualified doctor or nurse.</p>",
  "<p>September was not an easy month for me. Actually, it was horrible. My father is very ill, and I was worrying about that. Then I sold my house without - oh dear - finding a replacement, and suddenly my entire world was required to shrink to the size of the boot of my car. Plus, I'd been working hard: jumping on planes, running up hillsides. I was starting to feel just a little bit frayed around the edges, like an old woollen sweater. One last yank - a tax bill, perhaps, or a too-tight deadline - and it seemed perfectly possible that I might finally ... unravel. </p> <p>At this point, several of my girlfriends suggested that I check myself into a spa, seaweed wraps and detox programmes being the 21st-century answer to everything. I love my girlfriends dearly, but what they tend to forget about me is that I come from stout northern stock. Deprivation, even if accompanied by Diptique candles, is just not my bag. </p> <p>When I am worn out, I never find myself craving a glass of carrot juice, or even a deep-tissue massage. What I usually need is good food (lots of it), fine wine (ditto) and a vast, firm bed in which to languish after I have finished overindulging. Exercise? Oh, go on then: I'll walk to the nearest bar. </p> <p>All of which is a long-winded way of explaining how I discovered hotel heaven, better known as the Ch\u00e2teau de Bagnols, near Lyon, France. The chateau, which is owned by Lady Helen Hamlyn, widow of the publishing magnate Lord Hamlyn (it was once her home), and managed by Rocco Forte Hotels, was recommended to me by a male friend (who has seen the remarkable effect a good dinner can have on my spirits). </p> <p>It is one of the nicest places I have ever stayed. Magnificent yet understated, grand yet intimate, it has so many things to commend it, I hardly know where to start. So let me begin with the most important: should you be in the mood, you can have foie gras with everything. </p> <p>We flew to Lyon, and then took a taxi to Bagnols; the drive takes about 40 minutes. The chateau, which dates from the 13th century, is built of honey-coloured stone and has a moat and drawbridge. It sits on a hill surrounded by vineyards and a formal garden with a circular swimming pool. </p> <p>It was dark by the time we arrived, but I fell in love immediately. Impossible not to. My room, which lay behind a green baize door at the end of a long, stone staircase, was in the old chapel, and on its walls were ancient frescoes depicting the life of St Hieronymus. Better still, on the bedside table was a decanter of cool white wine and a plate of fresh figs. The bathroom, which was about a two-mile walk across my sitting room, was a mighty chamber of marble. OK, so the taps, which were shaped like giant fish, were a little bit Emperor Nero. But who cares when they can be used to fill a tub the size of the Titanic in less than 60 seconds? </p> <p>So began two blissful days of eating and drinking and loafing around. I could tell you about the attractions of the Beaujolais region, its many churches and vineyards, but what would be the point? I didn't visit any of them. I confined myself to attending to my stomach. The chateau has a Michelin-starred chef, Matthieu Fontaine, and I thought I should at least give him a whirl. In the end, I gave him two. On night one, I ate foie gras with balsamic vinegar, scallops with saffron and - hang it, I felt like something light - a hazelnut souffle. On night two, as a concession to good health, I had a plate of seasonal vegetables. Unfortunately, I followed that with a fillet of beef, cheese and about a million chocolate almonds. I must admit that my dreams were pretty weird that night. </p> <p>By day, we drove into Lyon to visit its markets: the outdoor Quai St-Antoine, where the aubergines have to be seen to be believed, and the indoor Les Halles du Lyon. Here, by way of a mid-morning snack, I tried the dried saucisson, some tiny goat's cheeses and a good fish soup. But markets can be tiring, so we soon adjourned for lunch in a traditional Lyonnais bouchon (yellowing wallpaper, moustached proprietor, gallons of rough, red wine). It was here that my greed took over: everything just looked so good, especially the epic bowls of pork scratchings in the middle of every table. I had chicken stewed in vinegar for my main course, which I followed with a palate cleanser of fromage frais with chives (an acquired taste) and an espresso. My friend Tom, defeated by his quenelles de brochet (pike dumplings), looked on in amazement - or, possibly, disgust. </p> <p>By the time we emerged, it had turned into a picture-book autumn day: sun low in the sky, trees the colour of M Fontaine's copper pans. We drove back to the hotel so we could enjoy this while it lasted. I wanted to sit outside, on the startlingly green grass at the edge of what was once the castle's ha-ha, in one of the strangely beautiful rocking deck chairs I had seen earlier. I was mad for these chairs, which were so elegant and so comfortable. The hotel has only 20 rooms, and it was off season, so I had the pick of them. I lay there, in coat and scarf and sunglasses, and, for a few moments, enjoyed a pleasing daydream: that this was my house, and Tom the lucky recipient of my hospitality. If only he had not chosen this moment to bring up the subject of the north London property market. </p> <p>Dinner at the chateau is taken in the Salle des Gardes, where the coat of arms above France's largest Gothic fireplace marks the royal visit of Charles VIII in 1490; and coffee is served in the Grand Salon, which houses one of France's most important and elaborately carved Renaissance fireplaces. </p> <p>What I loved most of all about the hotel is that almost nothing was ersatz. If some interior designer has waved their magic wand over the place, well, their ways with the swags are almost impossible to detect. A note on the desk in my room (18th-century, Italian, walnut) helpfully pointed out that my carpet had come from Agra, and that my table lamp had a fine 17th-century carved oak base. Even the Calamity Jane theme in Tom's bedroom - both his four posters were a riot of red gingham - looked OK, thanks to the stone floors and mullioned windows. Did we feel as if we had pitched up in a museum? All I can tell you is that not once did I find myself looking round for that dread suburban item, a coaster. </p> <p>Our final breakfast, served in a smaller, panelled dining-room came around all too quickly. As I slapped home-made jam on to a baguette - really, it's amazing how much breakfast you can still eat even after a night so heavy you could barely drag yourself up the stairs to bed - I told Tom I was feeling much better. So my jeans were a little tight. On the other hand, the bags under my eyes had shrunk so much that there was no longer any danger I would have to check them in when we got to Lyon airport. </p> <p>The truth is that a couple of gourmet days in France do a girl far more good than any amount of facials and yoga and lavender oil. In France, no one is on the Atkins diet, so if you accept bread, you don't feel as if you are committing a mortal sin.

  "<p>In all the fuss this week about gambling reform, it's easy to overlook that we live in an economy that's founded on a casino. It's called the stock exchange. All trading is at root gambling, a link that is made manifest in the phenomenon of spread betting. A growth area in the $100 billion global gambling industry, spread betting allows you to gamble on the difference between the bookmaker's predicted spread of events and your own predictions. Well established for sporting events outside the UK for many years, it began and continues in the UK in financial markets. </p> <p>Whether on financial markets or not, the name on the spread-betting label indicates the nature of the game: if you're betting, you can lose money.Yet the warning appears not to deter us but to appeal to our innate 'gambling instinct'. What makes spread betting in particular so attractive, and potentially dangerous, is that it plays directly to the two elements that are acknowledged to hook gamblers: ease of access and frequency of the game. Spread betters can play by the second. The variety of betting opportunities is another attraction. During the Iraq war, for example, gamblers spread- bet oil contracts and even placed bets on the likelihood of Saddam's fall. </p> <p>Although we know that playing the markets is risky, it is not the markets that make mistakes - it is the humans who play those markets. How do we ruin our chances when we gamble? How might we manage the urge? </p> <p>Successful spread betters, traders, investors and gamblers all have something in common - knowing when to hold and when to fold. Why is timing a problem? Because most of us want to be doing something, anything. Under laboratory conditions, people are more than happy to trade away merrily even when they have been told that real opportunities are few and far between. In fact the longer the long shot the greater the thrill. But activity is not the same as judgment. Renowned trader Warren Buffet describes his investment demeanour as 'bordering on sloth', while Jesse Livermore traded himself to pre-Second World War speculative infamy believing that the big money was never made in the buying or selling, but in the waiting. </p> <p>Classic investment texts and great investors all speak about the huge impact on our wealth of our hopes, fears and fallacies. Human behaviour inhibits us from holding or folding when we should. While practitioners have been aware of this from at least the beginning of the last century, it is only in recent years that behavioural and even newer neuro-economists have come to accept the role of human emotions. What makes us tick and why we take economically 'irrational' risks are now seen as crucial elements of systemic economic analysis. </p> <p>According to the Nobel prize-winning Professor Daniel Kahneman, market participants place far greater emphasis on losses than on profits. As a consequence, they hold too long (to avoid the pain of loss) and fold too early (for fear of losing what they've won). Some people actually find profitable trades more stressful than losing ones; they take hair-raising risks on the downside and are mice on the upside. </p> <p>Why do we do this? Research with very young children and animals shows that, being less emotional than their adult human counterparts, they are actually more rational. By contrast, adults find it hard to take decisions independent of their emotional memory, in which financial losses have become emotional losses. So when they are losing, people tend to throw good money after bad, particularly if that goal is receding or elusive. </p> <p>If you gave someone 'perfect' spread betting rules that dictated when to hold and fold, runs of losses would still be inevitable. This statistical fact puts pressure on people's emotional tolerance. After seven losses in a row most people will exit their next profitable trade far too early. The memory of past pain pushes them to grab any pleasure they can. And this emotional tolerance is a critical reason why great trading ideas fail in practice. As Keynes tersely put it, 'markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent'. </p> <p>If you know that losses are the only inevitable thing in speculation - the house always wins - you want to ensure you do not lose money faster than you make it. The real question then becomes how much you are willing to lose on one trade. </p> <p>Stop-loss orders can be placed with the bookie to limit how much you lose on an individual trade. Defining how much to lose can be done in several ways. Although the rules of thumb are unavoidably simplistic, they are a huge improvement on just throwing money around. </p> <p>Making sure we lose money slowly only gives us the time to begin emotionally appreciating these facts. You must still have realistic expectations, coping with what psychologists call the illusion of control, perhaps the most naked exhibition of hope in gambling. People often believe they can make a difference using their skills alone, even in something as unequivocally random as a lottery. North American lotteries became popular only when people were allowed to choose their own numbers. In experimental lotteries people pay more for lottery numbers they can choose than for random ones they are given. </p> <p>Further research on gambling behaviour reveals other very human wealth-destroying pitfalls. Profiting from the improbable is more of an ego-boost than boring success. Even some fund managers put the enjoyment of occasionally beating the index before maximising wealth. The simplest way to avoid that type of behaviour is by not talking about your profits or losses unnecessarily. </p> <p>We also know that people are willing to overpay for the slightest chance that they can win something large enough to change their lives. Combining kamikaze odds with those times when we are chasing money is a recipe for wipeout - punters lose more in later races as they desperately bet on longer-odds horses to get back into profit before the day ends. Floor traders at the Chicago futures exchanges have been found to trade more heavily later in the day if they were not profitable earlier on. </p> <p>Playing the markets is a tough game in which we are our own worst enemies. Pre-empting weaknesses will give you a head start to see if your strategies are worth anything, before being human makes your best-laid schemes go awry. You need to know your enemy and why it behaves the way it does. </p> <p>Incorporating such knowledge into your betting strategies should help limit losses - and just possibly take some of the heat out of both the markets and the debates. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Professor Chris Brady and Richard Ramyar are at Cass Business School, which specialises in the study of gambling and trading behaviour</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair will hold last-ditch talks tomorrow with Labour MPs campaigning for an outright ban on parents smacking children, after senior police officers confirmed the move would work.</p> <p>The talks will come ahead of a crucial Commons vote on Tuesday over the issue. Labour backbenchers argue that the compromise currently accepted by the Government - which would allow parents to administer mild smacks, but see them prosecuted for any that left reddened skin or other injuries - would leave families confused. </p> <p>Ministers have so far insisted that a blanket ban on physical punishment would be impractical, and could result in parents being dragged before the courts for what many consider entirely acceptable family discipline. </p> <p>However the Association of Chief Police Officers is understood to have written to Labour MP David Hinchliffe - who is leading the campaign for a ban - confirming that an outright ban would be easier to enforce than the current compromise. </p> <p>'This is going to the wire,' said Hinchliffe, a former social worker who has long argued that the current law on smacking favoured abusive parents. 'If this goes through as it is now, then there will be people who are in child protection who are going to have a hell of a problem with it.' </p> <p>Asked about the issue during Prime Minister's question-time last week, Blair said he believed there was a 'common sense way through this issue', but added that it could be better to 'feel one's way instinctively, as a parent rather than a politician'. </p> <p>However, sources close to Charles Clarke, the Education Secretary who is steering the Children's Bill, said he would not give in. </p> <p>An open letter to Peter Hain, the Leader of the House, signed by more than 20 Labour MPs, warns they are being put in an 'intolerable' position. They ask why cruelty to animals was a free-vote issue, but cruelty to children is not: 'Protecting children properly is at least as worthy of a free vote [as foxes].'</p>",

  "Stress is the biggest threat to the health of the nation's workforce, according to a survey to be published this week highlighting Britain's gruelling office culture. <p>Anxiety over heavy workloads, long hours and the threat of redundancy is fuelling an epidemic of stress, with 58 per cent of union health and safety representatives citing it as the major cause of complaints - outstripping conditions such as back pain and repetitive strain injury. </p> <p>The findings, expected to be published by the TUC this week, will prompt a fresh debate over whether modern office life really is more pressured - or whether the rise in 'stress' complaints reflects the decline of more acute physical dangers in the workplace. </p> <p>Stress at work is estimated to cost the economy \u00a37 billion a year in sick pay, lost productivity and NHS bills. </p> <p>Brendan Barber, TUC general secretary, said the levels of stress uncovered by the report suggested the drive to help people juggle work and family was not delivering. 'We know that long hours and dense workloads are stressful. We know that workers want a better work-life balance, yet some employers insist on trying to squeeze every last drop of sweat out of their workforce,' he said. </p> <p>Stressed employees were likely to be demoralised and less productive, he said, and it was in employers' interests to relieve them. </p> <p>The Health and Safety Executive is expected to publish new guidelines on stress this week, warning employers to protect their staff by auditing stress levels and offering counselling. </p> <p>The TUC survey of almost 5,000 health and safety staff found public sector workers were more likely than those in the private sector to complain of stress. Although being overloaded with work was the most common cause, there was a slight rise in complaints of stress due to redundancies. The findings come as civil servants are due to strike next week in protest against plans for thousands of Whitehall redundancies. </p> <p>Professor Cary Cooper, an international expert on stress, said the findings reflected the 'Americanisation' of the British workplace. </p> <p>'Jobs are no longer for life, you have the longest working hours in Europe, you have major social changes over the past 15 years - two out of three families are now [both parents] working - and we have cut labour costs,' he said. 'We have become too lean and mean, we have employed as few people as possible to make us as competitive as possible.' </p> <p>He said public sector workers had repeatedly been found to show more stress than colleagues in the commercial world, despite the common perception that they enjoyed shorter hours and a less cut-throat atmosphere. </p> <p>'There is constant change in the public sector, because it's influenced by the government - whoever is in government, not just this one,' he added. </p> <p>However, some argue that stress is a convenient way of describing a mix of entirely normal emotions, from boredom and frustration to unhappiness and fatigue. </p> <p>Frank Furedi, head of sociology at Kent University and the author of a recent book critical of Britain's 'therapy culture', has warned of a growing industry of stress-managers, life coaches and gurus who generate business by promoting a sense of insecurity and inability to cope. Research has shown that some short-lived stress can have positive health benefits. </p> <p>Yet stress, anxiety and depression are the biggest triggers of new claims for incapacity benefit from people saying they are too sick to work, and employers have warned of a rise in employment tribunal claims involving alleged stress-related illness. </p> <p>Cooper said: 'Pressure can be healthy, stimulating and motivating, but when it exceeds an individual's ability to cope, then you have stress.'</p> <p><b>Signs of stress</b><br> loss of concentration<br> loss of motivation<br> increased irritability<br> increased sensitivity to criticism<br> difficulty sleeping<br> waking early<br> nail-biting<br> smoking or drinking more<br> indigestion<br> </p> <p><b>Work stress triggers</b><br> insecurity and the threat of unemployment<br> feeling undervalued<br> poor working conditions<br> too much or too little to do<br> lack of communication<br> an unsupportive boss<br> too much pressure<br> bad relationships with colleagues<br> work that is too difficult or not challenging enough<br> lack of control over the way your work is done<br> interference in private life<br></p>",

He also has many female friends and a few he is very close to. They always sign texts very affectionately and he's mentioned they are very attractive.

Women who constantly fall for serial cheats exist in a world of suspicion until their self-fulfilling prophecy comes to pass. The question is: has their insecurity driven the man into the arms of another or does the cheat have the ability to snare a sap every time? The only solution is to stop being so passive and take some control. Instead of always fearing the worst, issue a diktat of openness. Join him on some of his nights out with these women and see for yourself how he behaves. It's perfectly normal to meet your partner's friends, so unless he's trying to hide something, he should be happy to introduce you. Eliminate your insecurities by facing rather than feeding them. If you behave like someone who expects a partner to leave, he probably will. Don't let previous duplicity ruin your love life - but, by the same token, don't let this man make a fool of you.</p>",
  "There was seemingly bad news for supplement-takers recently when The Lancet published a study which found that 'antioxidant' nutrients (such as beta-carotene, vitamins A, C and E and selenium) appeared not to reduce the risk of cancer in the digestive tract. The study authors also claimed that taking antioxidants might speed our demise. Emblazoned across the cover was the quote: 'The prospect that vitamin pills may not only do no good but can also kill their consumers is a scary speculation, given the vast quantities that are used in certain communities.' Not surprisingly, I've had a fair few requests to respond to what looks to be a bitter pill to swallow. <p>The Lancet study used a meta-analysis, where the results of several studies are pooled to get a more accurate assessment of a treatment than can be achieved by examining individual studies alone. The meta-analysis looked at 14 trials, of which only seven were appropriate for appraising the effect of supplements on risk of death. Close inspection of these seven studies reveals that six showed no significant increase in mortality. The overall results seem to have been somewhat skewed by one study, the results of which were out of keeping with the others.</p> <p>This last point was highlighted in an editorial accompanying the study. The statistician authors of this editorial also pointed out that the statistical analysis used was not the most appropriate for this study. When a more relevant test (a 'random-effects meta-analysis') was applied, the apparent increase in mortality disappeared.</p> <p>The study that did show increased mortality was one in which supplementation with synthetic beta-carotene was found to increase death due to lung cancer in smokers and asbestos workers. This is not the only study that has found such a link, so my advice is for smokers to avoid supplementation with beta-carotene.</p> <p>The apparent lack of benefit from taking antioxidants was another surprise that came out of the study. However, the meta-analysis included studies that varied in nutrients and dosages. With such variability, it is hard to get an overall picture. Also, the duration of the studies may not have been long enough to see benefits. It is also possible that because the Lancet study only looked at digestive-tract cancers, it may have missed other benefits with regard to cancer or conditions such as stroke.</p> <p>The deficiencies in this study's scope and methodology led the authors of the editorial to conclude that it did 'not offer convincing proof of hazard'. Oddly, the Lancet's front-cover splash was lifted (out of context) from the same editorial. It's a sad day for science when one of the world's most respected medical journals chooses not to let the facts get in the way of a good story.</p> <p><b>Dear John</b><br></p> <p><b>I have worn contact lenses for 10 years.

Also, moisture is held in the surface of the eye. There is evidence that dryness of the eyes may be caused by a deficiency of healthy fats, or essential fatty acids. While it is possible that omega-3 fats (such as fish oils) may help dry eyes, there does not seem to be any research on this. The science in this area has focused on fats known as gamma linolenic acid (GLA) and linoleic acid (LA) - both of which are of the omega-6 class. In one study, supplementation with GLA and LA helped to reduce the symptoms of dry eyes. This study found that omega-6 supplements reduced inflammation, too - and this might help to control your conjunctivitis symptoms.

  "<p>I have worked in human evolution for nearly 30 years and I have become used to new fossils turning up, 'rewriting human evolution', mostly at its remote beginnings. But the discovery of the remains from Flores has to be the most startling. So small, so late, and so little brain. Science thrives on the unexpected, and LB1, as she is known, was truly unforeseen.</p> <p>Perhaps even more astonishing, at least for scientists, has been the press coverage. This extinct species has been front-page news in virtually every country. Our diminutive relative, surviving so close to our own time, has caught the world's imagination. It seems that nothing in science is as fascinating as the history of ourselves.</p> <p>But it has not always been like this. The last time human remains hit the headlines occurred when the government-sponsored Palmer Report was published. It was deeply antagonistic to research on human remains, and recom mended straitjacketing archaeological research within the same framework as medical science. It suggests that, wherever possible, human remains should be offered to local communities for reburial.</p> <p>The government is now consulting prior to proposing legislation on the issue of human remains, with major implications for research in this field - and for this wonderful creature that has so excited the world. Homo floresiensis is the smallest human-like creature ever found, and to understand it we need to look at all the diminutive peoples of the world - from Africa, the Philippines, New Guinea - who provide the comparative context in which we can try to understand the curious biology of this lost population.</p> <p>But if the full recommendations of Palmer were in place, the remains of these populations would be lost, or only available for study under limited circumstances. In Australia, skeletons that are older than the Flores pygmy have already been reburied and lost to science.</p> <p>And what a contrast, from the genuine sense of excitement generated by the discovery of Flores to the lack of curiosity about what it means to be human that imbues the spirit of the Palmer report. Let us hope that if the little lady of Flores still has something to contribute to humanity (for she clearly did not contribute her genes) it will be the way in which she has inspired us to pursue the adventure of our own past, and not be constrained by the limits of our local political village.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Robert Foley is director of the Leverhulme Centre of Human Evolutionary Studies at the University of Cambridge.</p>",
  "Tessa Jowell last night vowed to push on with her controversial gambling bill, insisting people would be given an effective veto over mega-casino complexes on their doorsteps. <p>The Culture Secretary faces a Commons revolt tomorrow among Labour backbenchers over plans to liberalise gambling, with critics arguing it will only encourage addiction. </p> <p>Jowell yesterday admitted she had been through a 'firestorm' over the bill, but signalled that she would not back down. </p> <p>'I will listen to all the arguments that are made, but I hope people will also understand the strength of the veto that the community has if it doesn't want [a mega-casino] locally,' she said. </p> <p>She spoke as the Tory donor and former spreadbetting tycoon, Stuart Wheeler, rose unexpectedly to the government's defence. Wheeler, a high-level poker player in private, said people should be warned they were likely to lose if they gambled, but added: 'People must be allowed to do what they want to do unless there is some extremely good reason to the contrary.' </p> <p>Rebels are pushing for concessions including a formal cap on the number of casinos, or restricting them to a few pilot areas. However, Whitehall sources argue that setting an artificial limit on the number of casinos would only create regional monopolies, encouraging the owners to build the biggest casino allowed and squeeze every last pound out of gamblers. </p> <p>Although the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has said there will not be more than about 40 casinos, ministers would prefer to keep numbers down through tight planning rules.

  "Fierce fighting killed eight American soldiers and wounded at least seven more yesterday as reports indicated that the long-awaited US assault on the insurgent-held city of Falluja had begun. <p>US warplanes and artillery pounded targets in the city amid prolonged clashes with insurgents. A marine at a nearby US base described the strikes as the heaviest artillery bombardment he had heard in two months. At least a dozen airstrikes hit a southeastern district of the Sunni Muslim city during the afternoon, witnesses said. </p> <p>Yesterday, after a 30-hour drive from their bases in the south of Iraq, British units consolidated their positions near Mahmudiya, a town 25 miles south of Baghdad and 40 miles southeast of Falluja. The 850-strong battle group, composed largely of infantry from the Black Watch Regiment, will try to intercept insurgents fleeing from Falluja as the attack progresses and maintain security on key north-south roads. </p> <p>A soldier killed in a traffic accident during the unit's move north was named yesterday as Private Kevin Thomas McHale, 27, from Fife. </p> <p>US commanders said on Friday that the aim of any assault on Falluja and Ramadi, another insurgent stronghold west of Baghdad, would be to break up secular resistance groups associated with Saddam's Baathist regime and to kill or capture radical Islamic militants led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian-born fighter who is responsible for killing British engineer Ken Bigley earlier this month. Improved security in the so-called 'Sunni triangle' is essential for Iraq's interim government to hold elections in January. Falluja has been beyond government control since April. </p> <p>Marine commanders say they face a volatile mix of up to 2,000 Iraqi and foreign fighters entrenched in the city. Some are thought to be former army officers loyal to Saddam, others Islamic militants led by Zarqawi. </p> <p>Attempts to broker a peace deal in the city have not been successful. An Iraqi delegation that met community leaders in Falluja last week made no headway, Mohammed Bashar al-Faydhi, a spokesman for the Association of Muslim Scholars, a Sunni clerical association, said. Faydhi also called on those holding Margaret Hassan, the Dublin-born aid worker kidnapped earlier this month, to release her. </p> <p>Talks between Falluja and another government team broke down this month over Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's demand that Falluja hand over extremists, notably Zarqawi, who Falluja leaders claim are not in the city. </p> <p>The battle for the city is likely to be intense. British troops deployed last week have been warned by military intelligence analysts that, though they will not be actually involved in the battle for Falluja, they may suffer up to 35 per cent casualties if they are caught in heavy fighting. </p> <p>Intelligence assessments based on the experience of units engaged in combating insurgents in the central Iraqi towns of Kut and Amara earlier this year have been passed to senior officers in the Black Watch regiment battle group, which is still moving into its new positions to the south of the so-called 'Triangle of Death'. </p> <p>'The Black Watch are only meant to be deployed for a month, but that is enough time for a lot of people to get hurt,' said one military analyst. </p> <p>The attack is also likely to involve thousands of newly trained Iraqi forces. Witnesses said yesterday that Iraqi forces opened fire randomly on six vehicles, including three minibuses, after a US convoy came under attack 25 miles south of Baghdad. Dr Abdul Razzaq al-Janabi, director of Iskandariya General Hospital, said 14 people were killed and 10 others injured. More wounded were taken to other hospitals. </p> <p>The area is a major insurgent hotspot where ambushes and attacks against US and Iraqi forces are common Other reports said that at least half the dead were fighters who had engaged US troops. The area is close to where the British forces have now deployed. </p> <p>In Baghdad, a bomb exploded outside the offices of the al-Arabiya satellite TV channel, seen by radicals as being too pro-Western, injuring at least 15 and killing seven.</p>",

The hour-long programme will be presented by one of a roster of five regulars: Kwame Kwei-Armah, Mariella Frostrup, Andrew Graham-Dixon, Charles Hazlewood and Verity Sharp; and it will feature a number of regular reporters, including Robert Hughes, Mark Kermode and Zina Saro-Wiwa, as well as irregular ones, both arts practitioners and journalists. </p> <p>Clearly, the timing of this launch is not unrelated to the BBC's charter renewal; nor is the way that the programme will be structured, both in its determination to cover all varieties of culture and in its fashionable deference to the 'nations and regions'. One third of the 50-strong production team is based in Glasgow, and the programme will be presented each week from a different location, mostly in Britain, and occasionally internationally. </p> <p>Even though The Culture Show is the flagship of the new Topical Arts Unit, and Roly Keating, the new Controller of BBC2, says his channel is behind the programme 'for the long haul: it will evolve, but we're committed to it for at least a couple of years', the likelihood is that you won't have heard of it yet. Verity Sharp only signed up as a presenter last week; and, since she also works on Late Junction , she went to see senior staff at Radio 3 to clear her involvement with them, 'and they said. \"Oh, right, we've never heard of it.\"' </p> <p>This lack of fanfare may be partly due to the BBC's reluctance to point up the paucity of its regular arts journalism in the recent past, but is probably mostly to do with a desire to keep things fluid, and leave room for manoeuvre. 'At the moment there's an anarchy of voices, all arguing for different things,' says one presenter. Everyone involved gives off a sense that they have embarked on something of an experiment and that they expect that all sorts of things about it could change. </p> <p>Graham-Dixon compares the launch of the Independent , when there was an ambition that arts critics would mix, mingle and write beyond their specialisms, which quickly proved incompatible with the logistics of keeping up with what was happening and covering events authoritatively. Similar uncertainty about roles hovers over The Culture Show , with a number of the presenters telling me they are keen to make films beyond their specialisms, while others were expecting to stay pretty much with what they know best. </p> <p>The only pilot in existence is little more than a showreel of presenters walking about and talking to camera: there has not been a long run-up. (The changeover of channel controller has been time-consuming; now there is a need to get the thing on air.) But the plan is to have around six items a show, one of which will dictate the location. There will be two roundups: one of cultural news in the first half-hour, the other of things to look out for. The anchor for the week may well also be the reporter on the lead item, or on another film, and will be filmed on location on a Wednesday, with voice-over done on the day of transmission. </p> <p> The Culture Show can be expected to differ from The Late Show in being pre-recorded, weekly, and, most significantly, in tone. George Entwistle, executive editor of the topical arts unit and of the programme, explains that 'on the first show we have commissioned Andrew Marr to do a follow-up interview with David Hockney, after he painted Marr for his portrait show earlier this year. Rather than assuming knowledge of who David Hockney is, we'll provide material to get people in at the beginning.' </p> <p>The brevity of the items, combined with this imperative to explain, raises concerns about superficiality: how much room will there be for subtlety, for sophistication and surprise? Until the programme starts, it's frankly impossible to tell, although it's clearly something to which the team has given thought. 'It's a challenge,' Entwistle acknowledges, 'but providing more information to contextualise need not be offputting. There are people who think that the only way to avoid dumbing down is to be challenging to watch, and I simply don't accept that.' </p> <p>The ambition to be inclusive is admirable, but hard to pull off: you get the sense that if the early episodes were universally derided as culture-as-soundbites, there would be room for some regrouping, perhaps some longer items. </p> <p>Mariella Frostrup points out, though, that 'it's possible to be an opera buff and know very little about cinema'. In other words, if the pro gramme intends to range far and wide, providing context will be vital. Verity Sharp says that her experience on Late Junction is that, 'If you put things next to each other and don't talk down, you can consume all sorts of things that you might not have expected.' </p> <p>A lot, then, will depend on the presenters. Graham-Dixon worked on The Late Show and notes that the new programme won't have that show's 'midnight mood' or vast resources: 'We'll have to be tighter, and I imagine, slightly more sensible.' Hazlewood hopes there will be a less exclusive atmosphere: 'There was a slight sense with The Late Show that the arts were to be viewed with amazement and reverence and it was OK to be a bit opaque, and a feeling that if you weren't cool enough, tough.' </p> <p>It's hard to see how Charles Hazlewood can fit in even a once-a-month commitment between his prolific career as a guest conductor, his premiering of new works (more than 50 in the past six years), his artistic directorship of Dimpho Di Kopanein Cape Town, the two orchestras he runs, his other films and his Radio 2 programme featuring everything from Ligeti to the Prodigy. </p> <p>This is where sampling from a diverse group of presenters looks like a good move, because Hazlewood's day-to-day involvement in music supplies a practitioner's verve, combined with a determination to open up his world - and it would be impossible to get him any more often. 'If I go and look at an arts centre, I won't just interview the director and the architect,' he says, 'I'll work with an orchestra in there, explore it in a no-nonsense, hands-on way.' </p> <p>Other presenters will be expected to feed in their passions, both mainstream and obscure. Sharp has 'a growing interest in the roots music of this country. I'm already boring them with folk music'. Graham-Dixon, though he has a background in journalism, is less interested in how things happen than the work itself: 'I want to see culture more than comment. If there's a performance artist, let's see them working. When some fantastic painting by Manet turns up in London for the first time ever, let's go and look at it. Television cameras can take people where they wouldn't otherwise be able to go.' </p> <p>George Entwistle's background is in news and current affairs, most recently as editor of Newsnight (and Newsnight Review ) and he brings to his new role a reactive outlook and an interest in culture in its widest sense. His new job gives him oversight of BBC2 and BBC4's topical output, including the new independent-made media show The Desk which will start in January, and be presented by Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9. Entwistle will have to steer a course between, on one hand, limiting The Culture Show to a 'Worthy Artefacts' definition of the arts and, on the other, having a permanent state of warfare between the two programmes about which gets to cover what in the wider culture. </p> <p>Late Show presenter turned novelist Sarah Dunant says that she believes The Late Show 's achievement was to make the arts canon indivisible from the rest of what we consume culturally, and from politics - 'so we might do an item on Rupert Murdoch's empire, or, the day Thatcher resigned, we had a whole programme on what we mean by Thatcherism.' Both Entwistle and Keating (a former Late Show editor) insist that they are not about to redefine culture in a narrow sense. 'We will have the virtues of The Late Show ,' Keating says: 'intelligent, questioning, highly topical, a generous definition of culture - but we will be less metropolitan.' </p> <p>They decline to specify quite whom they're pitching to: everyone, seems to be the answer. In which case, you wonder why they haven't given The Culture Show a better slot in the schedule. It's great to have an arts programme that isn't on an obscure channel, or late at night, but why not in one of the property-makeover/ gardening slots? Many commuters in the south east aren't home by 7pm, it's infant bedtime, and some city and media workers in London are only just leaving their offices. It must be hoped that the worries about ratings which seem to accompany any programme about the arts aren't allowed to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. </p> <p>No one can tell yet what The Culture Show will be like; even the people behind it are tentative. 'I feel we're learning what this show is,' Entwistle says. It seems likely that whatever we see in the first five programmes is unlikely to be exactly what we're seeing by the 25th. But the show's ambitions to run the gamut of culture in a passionate, engaged and engaging way are estimable, not least among the current makeover shallows. 'We know what we're there to do,' Roly Keating says: 'tell stories with intelligence and flair, and trust the audience.' It's very much to be hoped that they pull it off. </p> <p> The Culture Show starts on Thursday 11 November on BBC2 at 7pm</p>",
  "<p>Chained by the neck to a concrete outhouse for 12 years, it was not much of a life. But given the alternative, Julie was lucky. </p> <p>Bought for \u00a360 as an infant, this suburban yard in Douala, Cameroon's commercial capital, was the only home she knew. </p> <p>Slamming her hands on the ground, screaming, the family pet was evidently in distress but at least she had survived, unlike most great apes in central Africa. </p> <p>After being captured with her in the jungle Julie's parents almost certainly ended up in a cooking pot as bushmeat, a trade which is driving chimpanzees and gorillas towards extinction. </p> <p>Young chimps like Julie are more valuable as pets but as they grow strong and wild they can also end up as bushmeat or as prisoners, chained to a wall. </p> <p>In this case there was a happy ending. Fed up with her angry and out-of-control pet, the owner contacted a wildlife centre at nearby Limbe to take her away. </p> <p>After being tranquilised and having her chain broken Julie was lifted into a cage and driven to Limbe to be quarantined for three months and introduced to other chimps who have also been rescued. </p> <p>Whether she will integrate is uncertain. 'This animal thinks it is a human. She has never seen another chimpanzee,' said Livia Wittiger, a biologist at the centre. </p> <p>Most great apes in the Congo basin never get that chance. An estimated one to five million tonnes of bushmeat is eaten here every year, its value ranging from \u00a310 million to \u00a3100m in different countries. </p> <p>In the past decade the number of eastern lowland gorillas has plunged from 17,000 to 5,000, according to Conservation International. </p> <p>Western chimpanzees have disappeared from Benin, Gambia and Togo and fewer than 1,000 remain in Senegal, Ghana and Guinea-Bissau. The UN environmental agency has warned that we are destroying a bridge to our origins - humans share more than 96 per cent of their DNA with great apes. </p> <p>Hunting and eating great apes has been illegal for a decade but it is only recently that the trade went underground, partly because since last year any restaurant caught serving meat from endangered animals faces up to three years in prison and a $16,000 (\u00a38,700) fine. </p> <p>'We know it is still being sold. Gorilla meat sells for five times the price of beef so there is an incentive,' said Marius Talla Tene, of the Last Great Apes organisation. </p> <p>The Observer accompanied him to Nkoldongo market in Yaounde, the capital, where porcupine and other legal bushmeat were on display. Angry traders ordered him out when he tried to inspect stalls. 'People threaten to kill us,' he said. </p> <p>Most hunters are impoverished villagers who use the income to buy essentials such as salt, fuel and medicine. The carcasses are brought to an informal depot in the jungle and then driven to cities. Logging trucks have been repeatedly implicated in such transports but traders also use ordinary cars, said Tene. </p> <p>'Restaurants and rich people know where to buy the meat. Sometimes they commission hunters but often they just go shopping.' Chimp and gorilla meat has been found in Europe but is usually consumed in central and western Africa. </p> <p>Babies have been sold as pets but nine out of 10 have died from disease and neglect, said Felix Lankester, of the Limbe Wildlife Centre. As awareness of the problem grows more of those pets which survive will be rescued. 'It's not too late, but there is not a lot of hope left for the great apes. They are spiralling into extinction.'</p>",
  "<p>Casinos are a dream vehicle for the money launderer with dirty notes to put into the system. Money goes in and out of casinos with such speed and in such quantities that regulators struggle to track it efficiently. That is why the law places great reporting burdens on companies that operate casinos. </p> <p>Casinos are treated as financial institutions in much the same way as banks and are subject to money laundering regulations contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The owners of casinos are likewise subject to scrutiny and their anti-money laundering procedures must comply with defined reporting procedures. </p> <p>Casino reporting and regulatory systems, even when they are well implemented, are regarded by the law enforcement community as vulnerable to abuse. The prospect of the creation of additional and larger casinos fills police with dread. One concluded: 'The present proposals are bound to add to London's laundering risk. The scheme is barking mad.' </p> <p>One risk is the system's vulnerability to abuse by an outsider. In 1998, four employees working at three casinos in Nevada were charged with laundering $400,000 for undercover agents whom they believed to be drug traffickers. </p> <p>Money laundering through casinos started with the drug, hooch and mafia barons in the United States in the Twenties and Thirties. They set up gambling dens in offshore centres like Cuba and the Bahamas to hide their dirty money from the authorities' gaze. These off-shore locations might today be the chosen bases for online casinos, as local regulation is minimal. </p> <p>Many casinos today are very reluctant to accept cash and anyone who seeks to buy their chips with large quantities of cash is likely to be the subject of a report to the National Criminal Intelligence Service. Like banks, casinos must make a report on anyone seeking to spend \u00a310,000 worth of cash or more. </p> <p>But many casinos will require a punter to use a credit card to pay for his chips. That allows the casino to identify the user, as well as the source of his cash. 'Casinos have bought into the \"know your customer\" regime applied to banks,' said one investigator. 'The days when they were laundromats for dirty cash have gone.' Casinos are also required to register large cash payouts to protect them against a money launderer falsely claiming he won dirty money at a casino. </p> <p>The grand buildings in central London or the provincial leisure and shopping facilities planned by the government offer little money laundering risk. The real worry today is the abuse of online casinos. Control in cyberspace is minimal and the scope for abuse great. </p> <p>One investigator told of a drugs baron who lived the life of Reilly in the West Indies. His bank account was in his home town and he wanted to pull together in a single account the profits from his drugs business, which were scattered around the world. </p> <p>His solution was dangerously simple. He set up an online casino based on his West Indies island. He then gave each of his operatives a credit card and told them to gamble away a fixed sum on his casino. Their losses were clearly the casino's gain, and he deposited them at the local bank. The mafioso paid the credit card bills with his dirty money, so ensuring both the transfer of the earnings to his account, and the removal of some compromising cash. </p> <p>'Online casinos are ready-made for money laundering,' says Michael Adlem, the managing director of Protivity, the UK risk consultancy. 'This criminal activity relies on the use of credit cards, and the only way it can be stopped is if Visa and Mastercard are excluded from the gambling arena. That would kill online laundering stone dead, but the credit card firms would resist it fiercely. For them, it is a money machine.' </p> <p>'Due diligence of online gambling is not as stringent as it is in other financing institutions,' says Frank Yu of Hong Kong's Ion Global. 'The online gambling site can be properly legitimate. But many fail in performing the due diligence of finding out who they are accepting money from and who they are giving money to.' Similar concern was expressed by Rick McDonnell, the head of the Asia Pacific Group money laundering division, a part of the Financial Action Task Force. 'Internet gambling is a vulnerable area. It is a risk.' </p> <p>One scam of casino owners engaged in money laundering is to doctor high-payout slot machines. They have been known to use sophisticated technology to override the machine's random system, using a 'back door'. They then arrange for someone who is part of the plot to make a big win. The 'winner' has not had to supply the casino with personal details, as he would have to do if he were a conventional gambler, and the money is taken without the casino making a report.</p>",
  "<p>Six years ago, I conducted a series of interviews with John Peel at Radio 1 and in the wine bar nearby. It wasn't difficult work: I turned on the tape-recorder and sat back, and after 10 minutes of mild suspicion and Rioja he hit a groove of sad and funny stories that brought tears to his eyes and mine, and all I could do was hope the batteries were fresh. </p> <p>My memory of him is of a hugely sensitive man who cared very much about his music and his family, but also about how he was regarded by others. A magazine interview he had recently given had been very harsh on him, questioning whether he genuinely liked most of the records he played, and Peel had been terribly hurt by it. Looking back, it is significant how often in our conversations he considered his standing among his peers, and how much he relished his reputation as a pariah within the corporation. This was a role he found useful to foster, but in truth he was a shy and quiet man, prone to internalising his anger. And he was immensely loyal; he knew that he could only function in public service broadcasting, and in time he became its best advertisement. </p> <p>I had first met him 18 years earlier, when he provided the narration for a radio documentary I had written. I told him how thrilled I was to hear him voice my script, and was astonished when he replied that he was genuinely happy to have the extra work. The extent of his talents was not fully exploited until Home Truths many years later. His impact on so many lives has not been fully measured until the past week. </p> <p>His producer and great friend John Walters, who Peel was convinced would deliver the eulogy at his funeral but died three years before him, had warned me that many of Peel's stories were embellished, and he could prove that some of them couldn't possibly be true. Peel often told him that his grandfather used to get champagne on the National Health. Walters questioned him on this, and Peel always said, 'Yes, champagne.' Eventually, the story changed. 'Oh, I asked my mum, and I muddled it up,' Peel conceded one day. 'It wasn't champagne. It was morphine.' </p> <p>Peel told me that his domestic life had recently been 'complicated'. His beloved wife Sheila had a made a good recovery from her brain haemorrhage, an event he found 'unimaginably terrifying', but her eyesight had deteriorated. In addition, her mother had recently died, and her father had moved in, and their children were in various stages of leaving home. Throughout these turmoils, there was one reliable comfort. He said that everything 'seems to be all right again when I come in and start mispronouncing the names of songs'. </p> <p>Here are my own favourite Peel stories from those tapes.</p> <p>On discovering Elvis:</p> <p>'I'm a great believer in getting your priorities wrong, setting your sights low, so that you don't go through your whole life frustrated that you never became prime minister. </p> <p>As a young lad, I used to listen to the American Forces Network in Europe, coming out of Stuttgart, and to Radio Luxembourg, and the signals were always satisfyingly feeble, so that you really felt you were participating in something quite exceptional. The record that genuinely changed my life was on Two-Way Family Favourites on the BBC. It may be hard now to understand how frustrating it was to listen to the radio then, because you could often sit and listen to a programme for several hours and not hear a single record that you liked. You'd listen to things like Housewives' Choice in the morning - based on the premise, shared by Radio 1 when it started, that housewives were some sort of subnormal minority group, as if perfectly sensible women would walk down the aisle but then return as gibbering idiots. </p> <p>Two-Way Family Favourites was a show that reunited our boys overseas with their families back home on a Sunday lunchtime. One afternoon I heard them say, 'Lance Bombardier Higgins has requested the first record by the new American singing sensation Elvis Presley.' On came Elvis, and it sounds idiotic to say it now, but at the time 'Heartbreak Hotel' was just a revelation, like being transported immediately to another planet. The only thing that came close was when I heard Little Richard a few weeks later. It was genuinely frightening, as if something had been unleashed on the world that would never go back in the bottle. It turned out to be the case, wonderfully. </p> <p>The quest for perfection:</p> <p>'I lived in the States for seven years in the Sixties. In the days before we knew about sexism, me and a couple of mates used to follow the fortunes of a young woman who performed under the name of Chris Colt, the Girl with the 45s. We used to follow her from grisly strip joint to grisly strip joint. I was driving back from a particularly exhilarating performance in New Orleans, having left my friends down there, and I was crossing what they call the Piney Woods of East Texas, which cover an area the size of Belgium, as all big woods invariably do. I was driving along this long road in the middle of the night, and the moon was at the far end, so it was like driving along a silver ribbon, if you want to be poetic about it, and the hills were rising and falling, and there was a small town before me, and on the radio came a record by Elmore James called 'Stranger Blues'. The first two lines were, 'I'm a stranger here/I just drove in your town.' I just thought it was a perfect conjuncture of time, place and music. You always hope in the course of doing a programme that somebody somewhere may experience a moment like that.' </p> <p>Heroin in his hair: </p> <p>'I used to run a record label, catastrophically unsuccessful, called Dandelion, named after a hamster - that's how things were in the late Sixties. We put out about 30 LPs using other people's money. There were one or two I quite like to listen to, and one or two atrocities. Stackwaddy were fantastic. They had an album called Bugger Off , which Annie Nightingale used to play a lot. They were punks before there were punks - these very primitive lads from Manchester who played a rather violent and inaccurate r'n'b. Once we got a person over from the States to see a whole load of Dandelion bands at a college in London. We made the mistake of putting Stackwaddy on first. The singer was a deserter from the army, and wore this improbable wig all the time. They turned the treble up on all their equipment, so it was like listening to a kind of buzzsaw. The singer was very drunk, and the first thing he did at the start of the gig was just walk to the edge of the stage and piss on the students. </p> <p>When Radio 1 started, it was generally regarded as rather unhealthy for presenters to show any interest in music, as it was believed this would lay us open to unscrupulous promotions people offering fast cars and women. Of course these things never happened, but you did have to keep your interest in music very much to yourself. In earlier days there were times when senior management at Radio 1 seemed to be rather surprised that I walked upright and used knives and forks. I never saw my programmes as all that radical - more an alternative to what was on at other times of the day. But at one time I was regarded within the corridors of the BBC as being the Baader-Meinhof Gang of British broadcasting, and treated with a certain amount of terror. </p> <p>It used to be that we had a controller, name of Muggeridge, who was joint controller of Radio 1 and 2, quite a good idea. When the BBC was looking for a man to do this job, they quite naturally chose someone who until that time had been head of the Chinese section of the BBC World Service. Once he had got the job he interviewed various DJs one after another, and I was last in. I think he thought I would do something unpredictable and startling, like rub heroin into the roots of his hair. He was sitting at his enormous desk, a sort of Dr Strangelove position. At some point in the conversation I mentioned public schools, and he brightened up a little at this idea, as if at some stage in my life I had actually met somebody who had been to a public school. </p> <p>I said, 'Actually, I went to one myself.' </p> <p>He went, 'Extraordinary! Which one?' He was assuming it was some minor public school somewhere on the south coast. I said, 'Shrewsbury.' He said, 'Good heavens!' At this stage he was getting quite elated. 'Which house were you in?' I told him and he said, 'How's old Brookie?' </p> <p>It was clear that he thought, whatever he looks like, and whatever sort of unspeakable music he plays on the radio, he is still one of us. I think for a long time it was this factor that sustained me at the BBC.'</p> <p>The bloody awful rubbish: </p> <p>'At Radio 1 I try to keep myself to myself. I've always thought that avoiding office politics was a rather shrewd thing to do. I feel a bit like a person who lives in a cottage while a new estate is being built around him - so long as I can tend to my bees, I'm perfectly happy. I don't socialise that much with people here. I occasionally go to the pub or the wine bar with some of the women, because obviously they don't see me as a threat. I'm not likely to try to get off with them. </p> <p>I do still see the Radio 1 thing as being what I do. Radio 4 is still seen as being the senior service, so when a couple of impeccably middle-class women call up and ask me to do a programme I'm always hugely flattered. You go off to very low-key places like Coventry to interview a family who have 19 children, and you think, 'Oh no', but then you meet them and you come away quite heartened by it all. Sometimes, if you're a regular reader of the newspapers and watch TV news programmes, you can whip yourself up into a froth of despair. So going out and finding that not everybody wants to kill you is kind of reassuring. </p> <p>In 30 years there has genuinely never been an attempt by management to exert any control over my programmes, not beyond the occasional comment like, 'Ah, John, you still playing that bloody awful rubbish?' Someone from management did come down when I was playing a lot of hip hop, and then later when I was playing jungle, to inform me that I shouldn't be playing this music, because it was the music of the black criminal classes. </p> <p>I think I was a handy safety valve for some time. If someone called up to complain about the safe and predictable nature of the station's playlist, someone could always tell them, 'You can always listen to John Peel. He plays strange discs.' </p> <p>Tony Blackburn goes Barry Manilow:</p> <p>'As a Radio 1 DJ, you were expected to do ludicrous things. We had these Radio 1 Fun Weeks, which usually consisted of travelling the country with a bunch of other DJs, and Noel Edmonds filling people's hotel rooms with chickens. In more enlightened days than ours you'd be burnt at the stake for doing that. People like Mike Read and DLT would often complain that they couldn't go anywhere without being recognised, but of course would go everywhere in a tartan suit carrying a guitar, so they would have attracted attention in a lunatic asylum. </p> <p>But these things did have compensations. Perhaps the best moment for me took place in a multistorey hotel in Birmingham, in something called the Dickens Bar, lots of dark-wood booths full of people who no doubt travelled around the country selling Dickens Bars to other hotels. Tony Blackburn got up with Paul Williams, a Radio 1 producer who used to play the piano tolerably well, and sang for about half an hour. There was massive indifference to his efforts, if not downright hostility, yet he went through the whole thing as if he was Barry Manilow at the Copacabana, as if everyone was absolutely adoring everything he did. He soared in my estimation after that. I thought, 'He's not such a tosser after all.' </p> <p>A particularly viscous tackle:</p> <p>'Occasionally, I'd be invited to these rather serious BBC events at TV Centre. I used to dread these things, but you had to go. Quite often I was the only person from Radio 1 who was invited, probably because I had been to public school. Once I found myself sitting across the table from the Two Ronnies and thinking, 'What do I say to these bastards?' </p> <p>On another occasion, I had just recorded Desert Island Discs , so I went along with Sue Lawley. When we sat down I was at a table which included Nicholas Witchell, PD James and Jonathan Powell. I turned to the bloke sitting next to me and said, 'Hello, I'm John Peel.' And he said, 'I'm John Birt, and actually we were introduced five minutes ago outside.' You don't really recover from that. After about an hour of non-conversation, I said to him something about football, and he said, 'Didn't you break your wrist playing five-a-side in Holborn about 10 years ago?' I said, 'How did you know that?' He said, 'I was the bloke that tackled you.' </p> <p>People say I 'discovered' or 'made' certain bands, but I never really think of it like that. I don't have a series of notches on my bedpost. They discovered themselves really, or some record company or manager did, and what I did was what I'm paid to do - play their records on the radio. I didn't discover The Undertones or Joy Division - they made magnificent records and I played them because I loved them. The fact that most other people were not playing them is the thing, but you'd have to ask them why that was. I think I helped listeners discover the bands, and if one more person has the chance to see Misty In Roots because they heard them on one of my shows, then I'm happy about that. </p> <p>I don't tend to mix with bands. I'm too shy or respectful, and I don't think I would know what to say. I don't know very much about their history. Also, there's that thing about not wanting to lower my admiration of them, which I might do if I met them, and I feel they'd certainly have a lower impression of me.'</p> <p> How to make the perfect radio show: </p> <p>'A lot of people working [at Radio 1], young people, come up to me and make rather un-British little speeches about how they grew up listening to my programme, which is lovely to hear, and then you can think to yourself, 'Well, perhaps you wouldn't even be working here if it wasn't for me,' and I quite like the thought of that. But even the younger ones stopped listening to the programme at some stage. It seems that people listen to the programme for a while and then stop, and often listen to the programme later on in their lives. I get letters from people who say, 'I hadn't listened to your programme for 12 years, and I was driving home the other night and heard something I thought was fantastic. I've listened every night since, and it was just how it used to be.' </p> <p>Sometimes kids write in and say, 'I was listening to your programme in my bedroom the other night when I was doing my homework, and my mum came in and said, \"What are you listening to?\" I said, \"John Peel,\" and she said, \"Oh, I used to listen to him when I was your age.\"' It's nice being woven into people's lives in that way. </p> <p>I always compare a good programme to surfing, not that I ever surf. When a programme goes well, you do feel you're riding along on the crest of something. You go out of the studio at the end and say, 'Wow, what a great programme!' and they say, 'Oh, it sounded like all the others to me.' But some nights you can come away feeling so desperate because you've made so many mistakes, and you go out and say, 'That was just a disaster.' And people say, 'Oh, it sounded just like all the others to me.' </p> <p>I listen to bands' demo tapes almost exclusively in the car in the two-hour drive home. The ones I don't like get thrown on the floor in the passenger's area and by the end of the week they swill about. The ones I do like get thrown over my shoulder into the back seat, and then harvested at the end of the week. I know that I'm going to die trying to read the name of some band in the headlights of a car behind me, and then drive into a truck in front. People will say, 'Oh, this is the way he would have wanted to go.'</p>",
  "<p>When you are away at film festivals, the temptation is to concentrate reports on the Brits, monitoring our brave boys and girls like they do at the Olympics or the World Cup. Often, there isn't much to write home about, so it's ironic that the 48th London Film Festival has played host to several British successes that have withstood scrutiny amid nearly 200 of the best films gathered from festivals around the world. </p> <p>The most energetic is <strong>Bullet Boy</strong>, a gripping drama played out on an east London estate and hinging on the power of the gun. Released from prison, teenager Ricky (Ashley Walters) is desperate to steer clear of trouble but on the journey home, his friend Wisdom (Leon Black) starts an argument with a gangster and the cycle recommences, sucking Ricky back in. </p> <p>Loyalty and machismo mean Ricky has to stand by his friend, crushing his own dreams of escape and self-improvement. It's a familiar tale in American film - Ernest Dickerson's Juice springs to mind - and there are also echoes of Mathieu Kassovitz's La Haine. But this is one of the first British films to deal with the issue of escalating gun crime (although Newton Aduaka's neglected Rage touched on it in 1999) and as such, attention must be paid. </p> <p>Director Saul Dibb handles the action with an admirable feeling for tension, never letting the social issues impede the dramatic power of the story. He's helped by a remarkable debut from Walters - also known as Asher D from rap ensemble So Solid Crew - who is an electrifying presence, conveying muscularity and vulnerability and oozing the sort of charisma last displayed by the late Tupac Shakur. </p> <p>The film has many memorable images captured by camerman Marcel Zyskind - a dead dog floating in the canal, children swinging from the crossbars of goal posts on sunlit Hackney Marshes - and mixes swooping, panoramic shots from high-rise towers with intense, claustrophobic interior scenes played out in the cramped flats contained within. Bullet Boy was a festival highlight, and marks both Dibb and Walters as big talents to watch. </p> <p>Another significant debut came from writer-director Amma Asante, whose <strong>A Way of Life</strong> made a powerful and challenging domestic bow and also contained the first film score by David Gray. Asante deals with racism in a poor Welsh town, where Leigh-Anne, a teenage single mother (impressively played by newcomer Stephanie James), encourages her gang to bait a Turkish neighbour she thinks has reported her to the social services. Leigh-Anne is a difficult central character - unlikeable yet pitiable, vicious yet fragile - and the fact that Asante makes us care about her and her poor baby is some achievement. Brenda Blethyn pops up, smokes a fag and, thankfully, disappears quickly, without distracting from the rest of the young cast's performances. </p> <p>Sally Potter's <strong>Yes</strong> also deals with race, focusing on a love affair between an American woman (the ever-watchable Joan Allen) and a Lebanese chef (Simon Abkarian) who meet in London. As in The Tango Lesson, this film shows Potter's penchant for stories about attractive women of a certain age who fall for exotic men, although Yes is by far the superior work. </p> <p>Written in verse, it touches on race, politics, marriage, dreams, identity and the search for life's meaning. Needless to say, it doesn't get close to answering any of these questions but its blend of poetry - sometimes successfully woven into the dialogue, sometimes sticking out like Shakespeare in a school play - and film stocks and styles make intriguing, if at times infuriating, viewing. </p> <p>Roger Michell's adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel <strong>Enduring Love</strong> (with a screenplay by Joe Penhall) formed the mayor's gala at the festival and has one of the most striking opening sequences, as a hot air balloon crashes into an idyllic field and several men rush to save its occupants. The film also boasts a terrific performance from Daniel Craig and is very good on atmosphere, capturing dark dinner parties, bright bookshops, sunlit London lofts and smoky cafes. It's an engaging thriller that cleverly twists and turns away from ever fully revealing itself. </p> <p>The biggest cheer came at the end of the family gala showing of Pixar's <strong>The Incredibles</strong>. Sceptical though I am about cartoons as adult entertainment, this latest from the Toy Story people seemed to please, as they say, audiences of all ages. The boy next to me loved it and barely noticed that I was pinching his popcorn. Visually, The Incredibles - about a family of superheroes called back into action after enforced retirement in the suburbs - is a wonder, beautifully combining design aspects from Bond films ( Diamonds are Forever in particular) and The Jetsons with simpler domestic animations such as Wait Til Your Father Gets Home. The action is strong, the dialogue wittily delivered by voice including Holly Hunter and Samuel L Jackson, and there's a brilliant fashion designer called Edna who creates Superhero costumes - 'No capes, daahlink!' </p> <p>About as far away from Disney as possible was veteran Senegalese director Ousmane Sembene's moving and uplifting drama <strong> Moolaad\u00e9</strong>, an impassioned plea for an end to the practice of female circumcision - or genital mutilation, as the subtitles call it - which is still common in thousands of African villages. Sembene's depiction of village life is just as important as his message: drums, bowing to elders, superstition, magic, tradition, plastic bowls, batteries, radios, chickens, goats and frogs. </p> <p>The plight of young Colombian women forms the subject of <strong> Maria Full of Grace</strong>, Joshua Martin's film about teenaged drug mules flying into New York with 90 plum-sized pellets of heroin packed into their young stomachs. </p> <p>Catalina Sandino Moreno delivers a strong, sympathetic performance and, though the action in New York is somewhat flat, the scenes of Maria filling herself up with drugs are wince-inducing and brilliant, and earn their place among the most memorable moments, not just at the festival, but in any cinema this year.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Manet: Face to Face</strong><br> Courtauld Institute, London WC2, until 9 January </p> <p>The most enthralling show in London right now may also be the smallest, centring on two works by a single painter. But both are masterpieces by Manet - A Lunch, from 1868, and A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re, painted 14 years later when he was dying of syphilis. United here for the first time in decades, moreover, each deepens the strange mystery of the other. </p> <p>It is true that they have obvious things in common, though that is hardly the whole story. Both are very large, about a metre by a metre and a half. Both feature a figure clad in black leaning on a table laid with comestibles: a figure very central to the scene and looking out of the image, though without making eye contact. And in each painting there are others in the background with whom these protagonists are no more in touch. Both were painted for the Paris Salon - 'the true field of battle', wrote Manet - and received all sorts of baffled if not furious comment. And both bring their protagonists right up close and personal, so intensely present, and yet so contained and detached. </p> <p> A Lunch almost seems to belie its own title. True there are uneaten oysters on the table, a lemon peel unfurled, white wine and coffee (all at once?) and a maid arriving with a further jug. But the daylight has dwindled, the man in the top hat is having a postprandial cigar and the boy has got up, walked around the front of the table, as if the conversation were over, and stepped right out of the meal. </p> <p>Why is he posing there, so prominent, so cocky, with his pertinacious gaze and tipped boater, to modern eyes somewhere between cool and camp? What is his relationship with the man behind him? Why all those curious props - antique helmet, sword and scabbard, and that black blot that turns out to be a cat? Is the boy just waiting to be off? </p> <p>Questions and fragments. And so it is with the Folies-Berg\u00e8re where the barmaid leans on the counter at the end of her tether, impassive, absorbed, hiding her inner self in broad twinkling light. Everyone knows the famous question here - why does the mirror behind her not reflect what is actually in front of it, behaving instead as if there were a second barmaid conversing with another of Manet's top-hatted men? As if there were two similar women; or just one in some before-and-after sequence - here she takes an order, here she is temporarily reprieved from the pressure of customers. </p> <p>Contemporary critics found both paintings incompetent or shamelessly inconsistent. Even his admirers put the puzzles down to a consuming interest in colour, or tone, or a passion for still life. Manet didn't bother to correct the mirror's reflection because he was so fascinated by the foil-wrapped champagne bottles and the gleaming tangerines; didn't square the lunch scene because he had so much business with the lemon and the light. </p> <p>But at the Courtauld you can see exactly how wrong this is, and how precisely Manet calculated each composition. Quick sketches were made of the barmaid at work, for instance, but the strangeness of the final painting belongs to the studio. X-rays show how Manet turned her directly towards the viewer, separating her from her own reflection. Similarly, A Lunch began convivially enough - the man addressing the boy, who patted a greyhound by his side. But then the man looked away, the boy lost his reason for lounging by the table and all communications were switched off. </p> <p>Does it matter who they are, these two people dominating their scenes with such detachment? The girl was apparently fairly recognisable as a real-life barmaid called Suzon, though it's hardly a portrait. The boy was called Leon Ko\u00eblla-Leenhoff and much has been made of the fact that Manet eventually married his mother, and may even have been his father, although he called him godson. Although recent, if not definitive evidence, suggests that the real parent was Manet's own father. </p> <p>But brother, son or godson, Leon isn't sitting for a portrait. He plays a role, just as he understudied for Manet's Fifer or his Boy with a Sword. Identity is not just a matter of appearance. As with The Fifer, where the pose was derived from a tarot card, so the pose here speaks of something quite starkly cut out, distinct from the rest of the painting. </p> <p>They are an extraordinary kind of hybrid, these radical paintings - not quite portraits, nor quite narratives and explicitly acknowledging the fact that both kinds of picture are posed. These may be real people, irresistibly real, but the scenes are conspicuously manufactured. You might say the girl and boy were taking part in something - a conversation, a meal, the taking and fulfilling of an order for drinks, except that they patently aren't. They stand apart, stand alone, dreaming. Not sitters, but people in a modern world. </p> <p>And despite the fact that we know their names, where they are, even who they are with, in the case of A Lunch (one of Manet's colleagues), despite the extensive social and biographical context that has emerged over the years, the paintings remain irreducibly strange. </p> <p>Strange as the disproportionate interest Manet takes in the boy's boater, striped collar, silk hatband - almost a dandy's interest, very sharp focus - compared to the blurred presence of the smoker. That smoker who seems like a Manet surrogate, a kind of narrator or intermediary between the past-tense maid and the present-tense boy; but who also seems a counterpart to the customer at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re. </p> <p>That man who ought to be, could be, standing where you stand. Except that he is part of that very queer scene with the rearview girl - a scene that might be happening in a dream, or in the past, or in some other room. An illogic that feels richly metaphori cal, as if the barmaid had a split personality, or a double existence. </p> <p>Which is exactly what she has, and the boy in the boater has too - quite separate public and private selves. Manet finds a new way of painting this truth, altering the concept of realist painting in the process. These are images of outward appearances, but also internal lives you see but can't reach, and of the tremendous distance between them.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Dizzee Rascal</strong><br> Leeds University Union</p> <p>19-year-old Dylan Mills has achieved so much in the past 14 months - from scooping the Mercury Music Prize for his astounding debut Boy in da Corner to club, festival and TV appearances of ever-increasing stature, to last month's follow-up album, Showtime, that it comes as a shock to realise that this is actually his first proper UK tour. </p> <p>He may have received a surprisingly healthy reception in the States, but some would argue that Dizzee faces a harder task in trying to take such an intensely symbiotic urban sound into the provinces of his homeland. Born and bred in the east London estates of Bow, Hackney and Tower Ham lets, the sound and culture of Grime is one firmly set in a world which, you would think, would be alien to the majority of the audience in Leeds University union. </p> <p>If anyone can take the grimy underground overground, however, it's Dizzee. Showtime demonstrated clearly an expanding of horizons, both geographically and musically and, while it may be a bit much to claim that his sophomore record can do for him what A Grand Don't Come for Free did for the Streets, it certainly cements his position as the country's foremost MC. </p> <p>Rising rapper Taz does an impressive job of warming up the crowd - a mixture of fresh-faced students and huddles of those who look more like students of the street, topped with a sprinkling of prime examples of thoroughbred west Yorkshire chavs. But tonight is all about the boy in the other corner. Arriving on stage to a rapturous reception, with only a behemoth of a DJ and a fellow back-up MC for comfort, the little Rascal at first perches on the DJ's riser, from where he spits out his first few rhymes. But if curious elements of the crowd need a crash course in Dizzee they soon get it, as he launches into the title track from his second album in trademark machine-gun a cappella. MTV once measured the speed of Dylan Mills's rapping and calculated he could rattle off 86 words in 15 seconds. Speed and skill such as that have to be seen to be believed, and when Mills scatter-guns 'Showtime' across the crowd, he's won them over. After a collective gasp of disbelief, they go suitably berserk and, from then on, they're pure believers. Don't let anyone tell you different - they get grime up north. </p> <p>He might need more than a backdrop of his album's artwork visually when he steps up to larger venues, but tonight, Dizzee's pure energy and non-stop barrage of rhymes are more than enough to fill the venue, with even the most guilty of feet responding to the fractured rhythms. </p> <p>All the big tracks from his debut go down a storm, from the breakthrough single 'I Luv U' to the ballsy nonchalance of 'Jus' a Rascal', to the incendiary 'Fix Up, Look Sharp'. He's not afraid to address the crowd between tracks, although 'Who's working class?' draws a more muted response than his request 'Let's see ya L's' , which prompts the crowd to raise their right thumbs and forefingers in an L-shape. 'The L's for London' he nods in appreciation, before adding 'and Leed...Leeds knows the score.' </p> <p>He returns briefly for an encore of 'Stand Up Tall', his previous single, and as he raps 'Sounds of the young star Dizzee Rascal, don't give it half-hearted, give it all', it seems as if everyone is giving it at least that, with those down the front of the crowd almost pogoing as one. Dizzee new heights, indeed. </p> <p>'How am I gonna pull this one off, man?' Mills asks self-mockingly in the intro to new single 'Dream'. You just did, kid. </p> <p>Dizzee Rascal plays Norwich UEA, tonight; Bristol Academy, Tuesday; London Forum, Thursday</p>",
  "<p><strong>Marc Newson</strong><br> Design Museum, London, SE1, until 30 January</p> <p>Despite the resignation of its chairman, James Dyson, in protest over the policies of its director, Alice Rawsthorn, and what he claimed was her determination to put style ahead of substance, life at the Design Museum goes on. </p> <p>Rawsthorn was still very much in control after the trustees met last week and decided to start the search for a new chairman. They offered to name Terence Conran - who had threatened to follow Dyson and resign as a trustee - as the museum's president, and make him a life trustee. </p> <p>Much of the commentary on the dispute has tried to explain it in terms of gender politics: bright young female director battles immovable masculine dinosaurs. And it's tempting to see the two shows since Dyson's departure each as a caricature of the two extremes. On the top floor is the show that goaded Dyson beyond endurance; a look at Constance Spry and the days when a domestic goddess could devote herself to flower arranging. One floor below, in a corner of the Marc Newson retrospective, you find a video showing the Sydney-born ex-surfer donning flight suit and helmet ready to take off in a supersonic fighter jet. Ironically both shows were curated by Libby Sellers. </p> <p>The real problem with the Spry show is, despite its elegant graphic treatment, that there is little to look at beyond yellowing press cuttings. Newson, on the other hand, is a gifted designer. And there are plenty of things to see, from delicate cutlery to a car. And to demonstrate that design is about industrial production as well as a taste for acid green and orange, alongside the T-shirts and jump suits you can see the tools that are needed to make his moulded plastic footwear for Nike. </p> <p>Pride of place goes to the Kelvin 40, the realisation of Newson's somewhat adolescent dream of a personal jet aircraft to a full-size object. Constructed from aluminium and carbon fibre, it is closer to an art installation than industrial design, but no less powerful for that. There are no manifestos, and no structural calculations or fuel consumption figures for the Kelvin 40. But it would be a mistake to write off his work as a superficial exercise in style. Designers like Newson are part of the system of industrial production, designed to manufacture desire, to make us pay more than we can afford for objects we don't need. But they are also outside it, producing work that is about the very system that feeds them. Newson explores, with a critical eye, the nature of the objects that a culture produces, detaching the language of design from their ostensible purpose. </p> <p>It used to be America that obsessed designers. Not Newson. The jet fighter he is seen climbing into has a Russian tricolour. Movies he watches are by Tarkovsky rather than Kubrick. The Nike shoes are called Zvezdochka. There is more than a glance to the Trabant in his prototype car for Ford. There is a kind of nostalgia for the innocence of modernity as seen through the eyes of a society shorn of the need to seduce the consumer. Ironically, the roots of the kind of Khrushchev-era modernity that Newson celebrates lie in the American confidence in the future that inspired another generation. And Newson's bittersweet celebration is a demonstration that design is about emotions as well as engineering. That ought to gladden Dyson's heart.</p>",
  "<p>For a moment forget about the charge sheet against Messrs Bush and Blair - the alleged lies about WMD or the illegality of the invasion of Iraq - and glance at the bigger picture. Global terrorism, global poverty and global warming form a toxic trio that promise a catastrophe that will make the horrors of 9/11 look like the Boston Tea Party.</p> <p>Do I exaggerate? In the Middle East untold thousands of Arabs are being slaughtered by US warplanes and artillery, supported by the British, to impose Western democracy on Iraq at the point of a gun. In Beirut, once dismembered by civil war but now at ease with itself, the young parade through the squares with grace and elegance. But listen to what they say and you discover a coruscating sense of humiliation and a deepening rage against America, startling in this most genuinely Westernised Arab state.</p> <p>Aliya Saidi, a young lecturer at the American University, was discomfited to be asked about Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld: 'I don't want to say I hate them but they are terrible people.' After an embarrassed pause, she added: 'I don't know if I should say that; my husband is American.'</p> <p>The resentment against the US administration (not the American people who are pre sumed to have been duped) crosses all classes and backgrounds. 'If the US continues to despise the Arab nation in this way,' the owner of a sportswear shop, Hadi Baalbaki, warns, 'I fear the whole Arab nation will form itself into one big al-Qaeda.'</p> <p>Richard Clark, Bush's former anti-terrorism coordinator who took charge in the White House on 9/11 and who retains close contact with intelligence agencies around the world, tells me that 'by almost any measure... the war on terrorism is being lost'. He cites the rate of terrorist atrocities, more than doubled since 9/11, and insists that the number of terrorists has risen to around 100,000 active 'jihadists' around the world. Chillingly, he believes these zealots are likely to be supported 'philosophically, politically, and perhaps with money' by upwards of 700 million Muslims - roughly half the global population of the Islamic faithful.</p> <p>When I was first in Lebanon, some 30 years ago, the young Palestinians in the refugee camps were taught how to use Kalashnikovs. Now, two generations on and still without any escape from their humiliation, they live in an emotional swamp of resentment and anger. Ahmad Iskandar is in his early twenties, edu cated and courteous and speaks as if explaining the self-evident to a backward pupil: 'I am ready to explode myself in Israel.' Ready to be a suicide bomber? 'It is not suicide, sorry. It is a martyr operation.' And what about the innocents who will die? 'Our heart is now dead. They make us forget everything. Just to go and kill them.' And he shrugs his shoulders.</p> <p>Already the poison of al-Qaeda is seeping into the Palestinian camps. Munir Maqhdar, a refugee, is holed up in south Lebanon where he leads a small band of gun-toting guerrillas who swagger around him as he says 'anybody who supports the killing of Arabs and Muslim people in Afghanistan and Iraq is a legitimate target. Any Arab or Muslim organisation is entitled to take revenge if the opportunity arises... the White House has to demonstrate that the historic injustice perpetrated against Palestinians matters every bit as much as the protection of the state of Israel.' According to the UN, 60 million Arabs live on less than two dollars a day, the population is growing rapidly, and unemployment is set to double in five years. The finance director of the Central Bank of Lebanon, Youssef el-Khalil, says that young people have a choice between corruption or fundamentalism. 'Fundamentalism is very much seen as the alternative to corruption... the war on terrorism has to address the war on poverty.'</p> <p>The neocons who hold sway in Washington do not flinch under this kind of fire. For them, in the words of Richard Perle: 'We are winning the war on terrorism. We have killed a significant number. We have put terrorists in many parts of the world on the defensive.'</p> <p>Try telling that to the two doctors I met in Ethiopia, who told me of impoverished young Muslims in the south-east of Ethiopia who 'are being indoctrinated under the coverage of religion with the beliefs and attitudes of al-Qaeda' and who, in some cases, are already in training for future operations. Try telling it to the American diplomat in Addis Ababa who gave me an 'off the record' briefing, holed up in the US compound which, like US embassies around the world, is protected from terrorist attack by armed guards, concrete barriers and razor-wire. He showed me a list of 'wahabi' clerics and business leaders in Ethiopia suspected of allegiance to al-Qaeda and volunteered that US special forces are now operating alongside Ethiopian soldiers in an effort to break up al-Qaeda cells in the Ogaden region. And how were they doing? He shrugged: 'We have already lost the war against terrorism in Africa.'</p> <p>Try telling the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, that 'we' are winning the war on terror. 'Yes,' he confirms (for the first time), US forces are indeed engaged in military operations alongside their Ethiopian counterparts but this 'police work' is only part of the solution - 'the most important part is fighting poverty'. This is not so much an issue of morality but of urgent necessity in a country stricken by familiar but excruciating indices of misery. 'There is a very frustrated population that sees no light at the end of the tunnel and therefore is susceptible to all sorts of saviours, false saviours,' he says.</p> <p>Ethiopia's 70 million population divides its religious affiliations almost equally between the Orthodox Church and Islam. Traditionally this has not been a cause of strife and inter-marriage is commonplace. But you now hear rage against America on the streets of Addis Ababa just as in Baghdad or Beirut. Meles is a member of Tony Blair's Commission for Africa though he has no illusions about its potential to deliver salvation. But in a continent where thousands of children die every day from preventable diseases and where (despite the ravages of HIV) more than 300 million live on less than a dollar a day, you are bound to grasp any outstretched arm and twist it to your advantage.</p> <p>As it is the grotesque distortions of the global market mean that for every dollar the West dispatches to Africa in the form of aid, two dollars are clawed back through subsidies and tariff barriers: a monumental rip-off by the rich as they instruct the poor to accept 'free' trade or else.</p> <p>A growing number of Africans, especially the young (mostly unemployed), use radio, television and the internet to keep themselves disconcertingly well-informed. The hypocrisies and injustices that are inflicted on them drives Meles Zanawi to warn that Africa, no less than the Middle East, could become the source of tomorrow's 9/11. 'Whether it is people in the rural areas of Ethiopia or the centre of Manhattan, we are in the same boat,' he comments, echoing outgoing European commissioner Chris Patten, who says, 'sometimes people are very angry, when they think that fairness is denied them until the crack of doom'.</p> <p>The president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, tells me 'it is not that someone who is poor immediately becomes a terrorist... but what are the children going to do, young people with similar values to our own, can't get a job and are frustrated in everything they try to do?'</p> <p>As it is, the West can't even find the resolve to meet its UN 'Millennium Goals' - to reduce world poverty by 50 per cent by 2015. According to Wolfensohn and Gordon Brown, this target date, at the present rate of progress, will be overshot by more than 100 years. There is no excuse: as the Chancellor tells me in great frustration, 'What is lacking is the political will'.</p> <p>It can be done. If every Western nation were to contribute 0.7 per cent of GDP to overseas aid, write off the debt of poorest countries, and eliminate agricultural subsidies to their own farmers, they could find in the order of $785 billion dollars annually for development aid - more than 12 times the present commitment.</p> <p>Which takes us - or should take us - from global poverty to global warming. It is the greatest challenge facing humanity, to combat both at once - to deliver justice, fairness and prosperity to the poor without destroying the planet in the process. Already we are consuming the Earth's natural but finite resources faster than they can be replenished. Already Britain's chief scientific advisor, Sir David King, tells us global warming is a greater threat than global terrorism.</p> <p>So what happens when the poor have their just deserts? Will we see the melting of the ice-caps, catastrophic floods that drown hundreds of thousands of people and turn millions into refugees and famished migrants? Will we all perish in some Siberian or Saharan Armageddon? Or find ourselves caught in a Malthusian end-game as we perish for lack of food and water? Or will we start to control our profligate use of carbon fuels and persuade whoever wins the American election that the resources of the planet must be more equitably shared?</p> <p>As with winning the war on poverty, so with global warming: it is a matter of political will. Which is why a deeply frustrated president of the World Bank says: 'If someone came here from Mars and looked at the way we run the place, he'd get back in his spaceship and go back to Mars and say, \"You don't have to worry about them, they are going to destroy themselves\".' Which means, as I argue in The New World War , we had better get serious about global terrorism, global poverty, and global warming.

  "The American election is ending as it began: under the shadow of the War on Terror. Within two hours of Osama bin Laden's message to America, both campaigns reacted to the haunting video that will dominate the twilight days of this ferocious campaign. Top aides to President George Bush arranged a statement on the airport tarmac in Toledo, Ohio. Similarly Senator John Kerry's staffers organised an interview with a TV station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. <p>For a brief moment there was an outbreak of that rarest of commodities: unity. Bush took no questions but offered an olive branch to Kerry. 'Americans will not be intimidated or influenced by an enemy of our country. I am sure Senator Kerry agrees with this,' he said. Kerry struck an even more harmonious tone. 'All of us in this country are united. Democrats, Republicans, there is no such thing,' he said. </p> <p>The truce didn't last. Kerry could not resist bringing up his frequent accusation that an opportunity was missed at the battle of Tora Bora to catch bin Laden. At a later rally Bush accused Kerry of politicising national security and called his words 'shameful'. Democrat aides then held an emergency conference call with reporters to push out the line that Kerry had not yet seen the tape when he made his comments. A news conference was organised and Kerry again appealed for unity with no reference to Tora Bora. But the tone has now been set. </p> <p>While the candidates will probably remain above the fray, Republican and Democratic surrogates are engaged in an air war over the bin Laden tape. The last few days of this election campaign will now see a bitter fight over the most hated man in America. And most strategists agree that campaigning on the issue of terrorism is Bush's home turf. </p> <p>Yet the drama of bin Laden's message disguised a simple fact: this election - the first after 11 September - has always been conducted in the heat of the War on Terror. Bin Laden's video was both a theatrical intervention and a reminder that honeyed words from both sides will not change the fundamentals of the last year's fierce campaigning. </p> <p>For if the two camps agree that they want Osama bin Laden caught or killed, they disagree on pretty much everything else. That will not change on Tuesday. Whoever emerges as the winner - whether via a victory at the polls or after a court battle - will inherit a divided country. One poll last week asked voters if they would support the winning candidate if it was not their own. For patriotic Americans in a time of war the answer to such a question should be an easy 'yes'. A stunning 62 per cent said 'no'. </p> <p>On the main street of Steubenville, Ohio, the Democratic and Republican campaign offices are next door to each other. Both are decked out in red, white and blue signs and ribbons. The only obvious difference is a radio placed on the street outside the Republican door that blares out the daily rants of the right-wing shock jock Rush Limbaugh. </p> <p>But the identical offices in this small Ohio town mask two utterly different views of America and the world. In the Democrats' office last week a young soldier sat next to his wife and worked the phones for Kerry. Stephen, 27, who wouldn't give his last name, is heading back to Iraq this week. His unit is based outside Falluja and he has spent his leave working to unseat George Bush. 'I just want to do my part,' he said with quiet forcefulness. </p> <p>Yet next door in the Republican office Anthony Falzarano burned with equal conviction. He supports the war. But his election is not about Iraq. It is about values and having a man of faith in the White House. 'We are the real America here in Ohio. We don't want homosexual marriage. This is not the socialist east and west coasts,' he said. </p> <p>The soldier and the shopkeeper are just yards apart on the same street, in the same town in the same state. But it will take more than simply electing a new President to bring them together. </p> <p>This election has now boiled down to Steubenville and the hundreds of towns just like it across the 'Big Three' of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. These states are the grand prizes of the election battleground with 68 votes in the electoral college. Both campaigns believe that whoever wins two out of the three will probably take the White House. It can be done without them - which explains both campaigns recent interest in Hawaii - but it will be tough. </p> <p>In the heartlands of Massachusetts and Texas, the battle has never really been joined. But in the 'Big Three' the campaign roar has been deafening. Both sides are now spending about $9 million a day, most of it in these three states. </p> <p>At the moment the race in all three areas is as tight as the national polls. 'The election is days away and we are right back where we started, in a toss-up,' said top pollster John Zogby of Zogby International. Bush often leads in Florida, but in Ohio, which every Republican President elected has won, Kerry is usually ahead. Kerry also holds a narrow lead in Pennsylvania. But the situation in all of the states could easily reverse. </p> <p>Each state has its own issues, which often dominate local politics more than they do national debates. In Ohio it is the economy that is key. The state has lost a quarter of a million jobs, mainly in manufacturing, since Bush took power. In Pennsylvania's wooded hills it is hunting and guns that strike a chord. Huge posters showing Kerry as a poodle stand beside Pennsylvanian roads with the slogan: 'This dog doesn't hunt.' In Florida, a mix of Jewish retirees, Deep South traditions and Hispanic incomers has made for a hotchpotch of ethnic interests that each side must pander to. The 'Big Three' are very different places. But they have one thing in common: division. </p> <p>Bin Laden's late intervention is unlikely to change that. In fact, the Bush administration had known about the bin Laden tape before it aired on al-Jazeera. They had been warned by the government of Qatar, where the station is based, that the tape existed and top State Department officials had urged the Qataris not to broadcast it. Their request went unheeded. </p> <p>But for Bush's top strategists it is hard to see how the tape is bad news. Privately many Republicans feel that the long-awaited 'October surprise' has finally landed and it hands them the advantage. 'People get scared and rally around the flag. I don't think the effect will be huge, but even a small change could be important,' said Michael Lewis-Beck, a political scientist at the University of Iowa. </p> <p>The bin Laden video also served to immediately knock several troublesome anti-Bush news stories off the media agenda. After a week of negative press about the President, bin Laden has handed the administration an escape from a damaging news cycle. The sight of the terrorist's face on American television screens will only reinforce Bush's warnings about terrorist attacks and his message about backing the commander-in-chief in a time of war. It may also provide a reason for raising America's terror threat level. </p> <p>Yet Americans' differing reactions to that message spell out their divisions. 'The Republicans are scaremongering. They want people to be afraid,' said Victoria Bender, a Democrat campaign worker in Ohio. </p> <p>Across the 'Big Three' there are simply two different visions of reality. One half of each state either sees the war in Iraq as a costly mistake or a vital front in the battle against terrorism. One side sees Bush as a stalwart pursuer of bin Laden, the other sees a failure to catch him. One side sees a catastrophic loss of jobs amid growing poverty, the other sees tax cut-induced growth and a recovery from recession. One side sees the entry of religious beliefs into political life, the other sees the return of faith and family values. </p> <p>The riverside town of Butler, Pennsylvania, is not prosperous. But nor is it poor. It sits in a swath of forested hills but is not far from the suburbs of Pittsburgh. Valarie Nold holds the fort in Butler for Red America. 'I am a huge Bush fan,' said the 44-year-old nurse. 'I don't really like the war, but I support George Bush's views on the family and he is a conservative.' A few blocks away office manager Ed Johnson can barely contain his anger at the mention of Bush. 'This administration disgusts me,' he said. </p> <p>The passions run deep across the swing states. Relations between Steubenville's neighbouring campaign offices are not good. Things have even become physical as each side's proximity to the other grates on party volunteers' nerves. 'We live in perfect harmony,' said one Democratic volunteer sarcastically. </p> <p>In Florida, America's political divide has turned darkly comic. Last week a Democratic supporter drove his car at Katherine Harris, the Republican official who was Florida's controversial secretary of state during the 2000 recount. The driver later said he was exercising his 'political expression'. Yet on the same day Florida's newspapers also gave wide coverage to a man who attacked his girlfriend after she revealed she was voting for Kerry. He eventually had to be subdued by police with taser stun guns. </p> <p>In America's swing states there are now few swing voters left. The fierce political fight has left little middle-ground for the undecided to stand upon. </p> <p>That, however, is where Larry Barr has positioned himself. Raking leaves outside the house where he was born in the Pennsylvania hamlet of Meridian, Barr said each candidate is flawed. But he still plans to vote. 'If you don't vote, then you lose the right to bitch about the result,' he said, spitting tobacco juice into the leaves. </p> <p>That bitching has already begun. The spectre of the Florida debacle in 2000 hangs heavily over the 2004 race. There is every possibility that this Tuesday will not produce a definite result. Both sides have armies of lawyers on 24- hour standby and at least seven states could be the subject of legal fights if the result is close. </p> <p>Across Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, lawyers have already locked horns paving the way for lengthy court fights if the election is close. Arguments have centred around Republican efforts to keep newly registered Democrats from voting. Democrats complain this is an attempt to suppress their vote. Republicans say they are just making sure the rules are obeyed. </p> <p>But behind the lawsuits both sides have waged a dirty campaign. Republicans allege that many of the new voters are fraudulent and complain that some precincts in Ohio now have more registered voters than actual inhabitants. At the same time Democrats have complained of mysterious phone calls telling them their polling stations have been moved. Or - illegally - offering to pick up their absentee ballots. Last week the Justice Department announced it was sending 1,000 monitors to the polls in sensitive states to ensure things go smoothly. </p> <p>Eugene Jones certainly hopes they do. In 2000 the black office worker failed to vote in Florida after being stopped by police on the way to the polls. They told him incorrectly that his car lights were broken and the vehicle could not be driven. Now, he says, he is not going to be intimidated. 'I am voting this time,' said the 31-year-old. 'That same white police officer is out there, but this time I am voting.' </p> <p>Whether it is on election night, or several months hence, a winner will emerge. Whoever he is, he will face the same issues. Bin Laden will still be the most wanted and hated man in America whether it is President Kerry or President Bush who tries to pursue him. The Iraq war and its role in the War on Terror will still split the country. </p> <p>In downtown Orlando, Eugene Jones described himself as a military veteran who sees the war as a disaster. But his fellow Floridian, and fellow veteran, Bill McGee, saw it as a victory for freedom. 'It's tough but its all about spreading freedom,' McGee said. </p> <p>The social issues that arouse passions across the political spectrum will also not go away. Kerry has bent over backward to appeal to the conservative voters who make up Bush's core base. But the anti-abortion right still dog his every campaign stop, holding up pictures of bloody embryos and quotes from the Bible. They will not be appeased by any Kerry administration that is pro-choice and committed to the separation of church and state. </p> <p>A Bush victory will be a huge boost to the religious right, to the horror of many Democrats. Many experts believe Bush will try to tackle the abortion issue, allowing it to be banned by individual states. He would be helped if a second term allows him to appoint conservative judges to the Supreme Court. In Steubenville's Republican campaign office, there is little doubt as to who Bush will owe his power to. 'If Bush wins, it will be the Christian right that put him in office. He will have to listen to us,' said Falzarano with obvious relish. </p> <p>Essentially there is no longer a political home in the centre. Experts say voters' allegiance to the candidates has become a tribal issue based on character and not rooted in policy positions. </p> <p>Americans are now simply choosing sides. Last week that fact was on display at an Ohio airport hangar as Bush addressed a 5,000-strong crowd of supporters in the Democratic industrial heartland of Youngstown. Beside him stood two Democratic defectors, Senator Zell Miller and Youngstown Mayor George McKelvey. Yet far from being the voice of moderation, both Democrats savaged Kerry as bloodily as any far-right Republican. 'The Hollywood leftists don't represent our values, our heart or our soul,' yelled McKelvey. The crowd cheered. </p> <p>Tuesday's vote has become just one battle in a continuing conflict. Whichever side loses will believe the election was effectively stolen. And the image of bin Laden making his threats will be the excuse the losing side will use to beat the victor. </p> <p>If Kerry wins, Republicans will see it as a betrayal of a wartime President and will accuse Democratic voters of obeying a mass murderer. If Bush wins, Democrats will believe victory was snatched from them by a man with the blood of 3,000 dead Americans on his hands. They will see bin Laden as having scared Americans into voting for a President they see as al-Qaeda's best recruiting sergeant. </p> <p>The political and cultural wars of America will also continue. As the Republicans will probably still control Congress, they will make any Kerry administration an exercise in political trench warfare. But if the Democrats are kept in opposition, the party could well be plunged into a civil war between its right and left wings. </p> <p>At the Youngstown rally last week, Ohio's governor Bob Taft appeared alongside Bush on the makeshift podium. Ohio's supreme importance in the election was uppermost in his mind as he urged everyone to go out and vote. Then he introduced his President by telling the audience a simple fact. 'We are the front line in the battle for America's future,' he said. </p> <p>But that war will not end on 2 November. Bin Laden's appearance on the scene has only served to remind America that the political war dividing their nation also extends to another war, one involving real bullets and real bombs.</p>",
  "<p>His love of the festive season is evident in his new set of Father Christmas stamps for the Royal Mail. But another of Raymond Briggs's wintry creations, The Snowman, has become so popular that, like Frankenstein's monster, it threatens to lurch out of control and overwhelm its master. The children's author and illustrator has been bombarded by so much Snowman merchandise that he is now forced to sell it on eBay. </p> <p>Bags, cards, cutlery, gloves, mugs, placemats, plates, scarves, sleepsuits, snow globes, tea towels, toothbrushes and toilet paper bear ing the Snowman's smiling visage are among endless paraphernalia spawned by Briggs's lucrative 1978 book and 1982 animated film, the repeats of which, featuring the song 'Walking in the Air', are a fixture on festive TV. </p> <p>But Briggs himself stopped watching The Snowman long ago and has been known to refer to it as 'the S-word'. He has now decided to clear out the attic at his East Sussex home and sell scores of Snowman mementos on eBay, the online marketplace. He will sign each individually and donate the money to charity. </p> <p>'I get stuff sent from all over the world, especially Japan,' he said. 'It's good quality, a lot of it, but there is too much and I just don't have room. I've filled up the attic and getting a big cardboard box up there is now very difficult, in fact it's a nightmare.' </p> <p>Briggs, 70, admitted he is a novice at internet selling. 'I didn't know about eBay. A lady who works for me is putting the stuff on. It could be a disaster: there are already pages of Snowman things there. I assumed everything would be \u00a310 at least, but I'm amazed to see some of it going for 50p. Why bother? There are all the costs of postage and packing. You can buy something for that in a charity shop. </p> <p>'We're starting with one item to see if it will work: a Snowman toy holding a tiny teddy bear, which I've signed. It's very well made, like Steiff teddy bears, and I can't remember if we've said \u00a350 or \u00a3150. There are mad collectors out there who will buy anything with signatures. If it works, we hope to put more on and raise money for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.' </p> <p>Briggs intends to hold on to some 'very good' china mugs and plates, but The Snowman, a phenomenon even in countries that never see snow, is not something he wishes to dwell on. 'I don't do interviews about it any more. What is there left to say?' </p> <p>Instead Briggs has revisited another of his most popular creations, Father Christmas, for a set of stamps issued on Tuesday. More than 30 years after his first Father Christmas book was a bestseller, the stamps show Santa in varying Christmas Eve scenes of hail, rain, snow, wind, dawn and dusk. 'Normally my Father Christmas is a domesticated figure, like a fat and grumpy old man in a bath,' Briggs said. 'That wasn't right for the stamps, so I decided to show him at work in different scenes, united by the theme of weather.' </p> <p>Briggs, whose childhood ambition was to be a journalist, is working on a major project illustrating a complete collection of Ted Hughes's poems for children. His previous books include Fungus the Bogeyman (1977), The Man (1992), The Boy Genius of the Stone Age (2001) and The Puddleman (2004). </p> <p>When the Wind Blows (1983), by contrast, was a landmark picture book about nuclear holocaust, but Briggs says a return to political cartooning is unlikely. </p> <p>'I've got to have a blindingly simple issue, as the threat of nuclear weapons was. I wouldn't tackle something like the Iraq war, which was not black and white. I'm not a David Low or Steve Bell, both of whom I admire greatly.'</p>",
  "Britain's defence scientists are threatening national security by hawking their services abroad, claims a missiles expert who has worked on top secret military projects for the government. <p>The allegation has prompted concerns from MPs who are worried that British defence expertise - paid for by the taxpayer - may end up in the hands of foreign governments. </p> <p>In June, the expert, who was contracted to QinetiQ, the government's privatised successor to the Defence Evaluation and Research Authority (Dera), wrote to Alan Garwood, head of Defence Export Services, expressing fears that some of his colleagues were looking to offer their services to defence agencies abroad. </p> <p>Such actions would be in breach of the Official Secrets Act if the scientists were to discuss, or draw on, work they have done while working for the British government. </p> <p>'While QinetiQ scientists have freedom to roam the earth, national security is at risk. I would welcome the opportunity to give you a more detailed account of my concerns,' the expert, who has asked not to be named, wrote to Garwood in a letter obtained by The Observer. </p> <p>The expert said he raised the alarm after learning that a QinetiQ colleague, who had worked on an Anglo-American project to develop an anti-torpedo device and had many years' experience in the field, had offered expertise to a foreign government. </p> <p>This employee, whose name is known to The Observer but is not being published for security reasons, made the approach last May. In an email obtained by this newspaper the specialist talks about setting up a company to offer know-how to the defence research arm of a Far Eastern government. </p> <p>'I would be interested in understanding if there were ways in which I could be of help. My query is really to inquire if [you] would be willing to deal with such a small company. Your advice would be most welcome,' the employee writes. </p> <p>The colleague making the allegations, who is at the centre of a legal dispute with QinetiQ over claims that it failed to pay him a series of sums as commissions, said he believes scores of other government scientists may be planning similar approaches in the belief they can make more money abroad. </p> <p>A QinetiQ spokeswoman said: 'Some time ago, when we were made aware of these particular unsubstantiated allegations, we passed them immediately, in accordance with our procedures, to appropriate external authorities for investigation. </p> <p>'We have had no information from the authorities to suggest any breach of security.' </p> <p>Last night Llew Smith, the Labour MP for Blaenau Gwent, said he had tabled a parliamentary question asking the Ministry of Defence to clarify how research conducted by government scientists was to be protected from employees of QinetiQ who resign, and 'then try to take private advantage of their knowledge'. </p> <p>'It is not right that taxpayers' money could be used to fund cutting-edge technology or other new discoveries, and the benefits go straight into the pockets of people who leave the public sector to make more money for themselves operating privately.' </p> <p>In an open letter to Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon, sent last August, the expert blamed the privatisation of Dera for changing the organisation's culture. </p> <p>'When the government decided to remove the civil servant status of thousands of defence scientists and engineers ... they also removed a level of control that ensured national security was robust,' he wrote. </p> <p>Following the privatisation, a stake in QinetiQ was bought by the Carlyle Group, the powerful US banking firm which has employed George Bush Senior as an adviser, John Major as chairman of its European arm, and has invested money on behalf of the wealthy Saudi Arabian bin Laden family. </p> <p>But the QinetiQ spokeswoman said the company had very strict guidelines which ensured its projects remained secret. 'All staff on joining QinetiQ sign to acknowledge their responsibilities under the Official Secrets Acts. </p> <p>'This process has not changed since QinetiQ was part-privatised, and it is entirely wrong to assert that privatisation has had any effect on the rigorous nature of these procedures.'</p>",
  "<p>New novels by Tom Wolfe are not merely published; rather, they arrive in town like stretch limos at the heart of a traffic-stopping motorcade, klaxons blaring, heralded by outriders on Harleys in reflective shades, their embargoed content already the subject of speculation, adulation and protest. The million-plus copies of his latest, third, full-length work of fiction, I Am Charlotte Simmons, will scream into print worldwide with just such a gridlocking fanfare in a fortnight's time. </p> <p>From the two clues to its concerns so far - chapters excerpted in Rolling Stone magazine and Men's Journal - it appears to be business as usual for America's satiriser-in-chief. Wolfe wants to locate his nation's most pumped-up pulse at any given moment, and strap his stylistic tourniquet on to feel its pressure. He works in decades. Following his inspired journalistic chronicles of Sixties Acid Tests, and his coining of Seventies Me Culture, his novels have attempted to put their exclamatory imprimatur on successive eras. What Bonfire of the Vanities did for the Eighties and Wall Street, A Man in Full attempted for the corrupt corporate billionaires of the Nineties Enron-economy. </p> <p>I am Charlotte Simmons takes this zeitgeist-roadshow to the mythical Dupont university in California, breeding ground for the masters of the twenty-first century universe. Wolfe has never lost his hunger for the new new thing. The dapper hack who hung out with California's elite surfers to write The Pump House Gang, almost 40 years ago, still at 73 wants to know exactly what fuels young America. Thus we will see him inveigling his unmissable authorial presence into fraternity houses and sorority parties to come back with the news from the front. </p> <p>You could see this novel simply as the author fulfilling an old promise. Wolfe spent nearly all of his twenties doing a doctorate in American studies at Yale. At the time, academia did not seem to offer enough of real life for him, and he took a job as a reporter in Springfield, Massachusetts. Though he never really stopped doing American studies, he told himself that one day he would go back to college to work, but never has until now. </p> <p>Wolfe's real subject has always been class, that great taboo of egalitarian America, what he once called its statuspheres. His interest is in elites, the glamour and sordidness and comedy of power. This has been a lifelong obsession. At the age of nine he embarked on a biography of Napoleon and a life of Mozart written as a comic strip. 'The reason I liked them was because they were - like me - both small,' he admitted, looking back. </p> <p>I once asked Ken Kesey, hero of The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, what it was like to have Tom Wolfe write you into myth. 'What you have to understand,' Kesey said, 'is that Tom Wolfe was never really writing about me, his writing has always mostly been concerned with itself.' Rarely can a writer's style have so enjoyed the red carpet as Wolfe's. Each of his sentences looks like a seductive cheerleader for its author. And he is not shy about revealing his motivation. 'If most writers are honest with themselves, this is the difference they want to make: before they were not noticed, now they are.' </p> <p>Such statements are guaranteed to enrage the higher-minded of Wolfe's peers. One of the things that will no doubt accompany his new novel is another incendiary round in the literary firestorm that followed the publication of the first two. No one else can wind up their fellow Great American Novelists with such ease. </p> <p>For John Updike, writing in the New Yorker, Wolfe's A Man in Full 'was not even literature in a modest aspirant form'. Norman Mailer, meanwhile, in an even more comprehensive kicking, compared reading Wolfe to being 'seduced by a 300lb woman. Once she gets on top it's all over. Fall in love or be asphyxiated'. (Mailer left the reader in no doubt that he was among those gasping for breath.) John Irving was more succinct, saying Wolfe simply 'could not fucking write'. </p> <p>Wolfe responded to these attacks in kind by saying that his critics - The Three Stooges he called them - were envious because they had 'wasted their careers by not engaging in the life around them'. He pointed also to an initial American print run of 1.2 million copies for A Man in Full, a figure they could dream of (and just stopped short of mentioning his $7.5m advance). </p> <p>One of the things Wolfe believes annoys his critics most is that he has never wanted to be one of them. Despite a lavish uptown apartment in Manhattan and his summers in the Hamptons, and his wife, a Jewish New Yorker, who was once art director of Harper's magazine, Wolfe still prides himself on being an outsider in what he calls Cultureberg. </p> <p>His father was an agronomist in the Shenandoah mountains. His grandfather was a Confederate officer in the Civil War. Wolfe never wanted to lose any of his southernness. He made sure he would not be seduced by literary New York early on in his career in an essay viciously satirising its bible, William Shawn's New Yorker magazine, as a home for the living dead. His famous white suit has been one shorthand way of asserting this southern separateness. He uses his uniform as a goad, and it works. </p> <p>When Wolfe's first book came out, The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine Flake Streamline Baby, this cultural Mason-Dixon line was already beginning to be drawn. Writing in the New York Review of Books the eminent conservative critic Dwight Macdonald derided Wolfe's work as 'para-journalism'. The main charge the critic laid against Wolfe then, in 1965, was that of transience. 'I don't think Wolfe will be read with pleasure or at all years from now, and perhaps not even next year... the subjects will prove of ephemeral interest and the style will not wear well because its eccentricities, while novel, are monotonous; those italics, dots, exclamation points, and expressions like Santa Barranza!... they will not last.' </p> <p>That they did last, that Wolfe's first-person style has been the single most influential voice in all journalism since, had a lot to do with the fact that he was among the first to realise that the clues to modern culture were not necessarily to be found in its politics but in its fashions, in its transience. In his subsequent fascination with the surface of things, in his love-hate for celebrity and the products of American dreams, the scourge of modern art has proved to have had more in common than he would acknowledge with Andy Warhol, that other dandy outsider in the big city. </p> <p>Like Warhol, though a stylistic radical, Wolfe has always been very much a conservative by temperament. 'You never realise how much of your background is sewn into the lining of your clothes,' he says. As a boy in Richmond, Virginia, he would kneel by his bedside each night, close his eyes, place his hands together and solemnly thank the Lord for making him an American. </p> <p>He has never forgotten that. While most liberal readers might have seen Bonfire of the Vanities as a vicious satire on the excesses of the Wall Street bull markets, to Wolfe himself it seems the comedy was more complicated. 'My original idea was to say, \"Look at these people! Look at the way they live! Look at what they do! Isn't it just amazing!\"' He could have savage fun observing the greed unleashed by Reaganomics, the great haemorrhaging of cash, but he still believed Reagan to be 'one of our greatest Presidents ever'. </p> <p>Wolfe squares that contradiction by being kind of American right winger who enjoys the priapic power of capitalism, and who prefers to laugh at effects than to examine causes. His writing borrows the energy of the individuals shaped by the extremes of those forces (it is no coincidence that his most telling and pyrotechnic book, The Right Stuff, was about the astronauts at Nasa, vicariously rocket-fuelled). </p> <p>By the time he set about to writing novels, this desire to incorporate all of America's energy in his books became overwhelming. In 1995, almost eight years into his work on A Man in Full, he described how every day he watched the events which his book wanted to include overtaking him. As he did not use a computer, each rewrite meant retyping everything. He looked a little like a character in a very American fable, desperately trying to stay one step ahead of his own satire. </p> <p>The effort of this very nearly did for him. In 1996 Wolfe had a heart attack at the gym and a quintuple by-pass, brought on, he believes, by the hubris of staring at a blank page each day and trying to make it reflect America. One of the effects of this brush with death, Wolfe said, was to break the thread he had always felt to his youth. It made him feel vulnerable, pervious, but he responded not with doubt but with redoubled ambition. And for this alone, as even Norman Mailer has conceded, 'one has to applaud his moxie'. </p> <p>As a result, the style that once looked like a wonderful cocksure show of plumage these days reads more like a rage against the dying of the light. Like Anthony Burgess, pressed into frantic action by a realisation of mortality, Wolfe, eight years on from heart surgery, seems only to want to go faster. The 750 pages of A Man in Full will thus be followed by the 680 pages of I am Charlotte Simmons. </p> <p>If his preview chapters about college jocks are anything to go by, his writing has rarely been more charged, more Wolfeian. Like the musculature of the basketball stars it describes, it is 'steroidal, ripped', all the time showboating with similes, hotdogging with vernacular, slam-dunking exclamations. If sentences could be on something then Wolfe's would never have been out of the mandatory doping lab. There is, however, no Viagra for prose. So you marvel that he is still keeping it up. </p> <p><strong>Thomas Kennerly Wolfe</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>DoB:</strong> 2 March 1931 </p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Washington and Lee University; Yale University (PhD, 1957) </p> <p><strong>Publications:</strong> The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby; The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test; The Right Stuff; Bonfire of the Vanities; A Man in Full ...</p>",
  "<p>War in Iraq; unemployment in the rust-belt; hanging chads - American voters may have any number of issues uppermost in their minds as they cast their votes this week, but the value of the dollar in their pockets is unlikely to be among them. However, the mighty greenback, for many years the symbol of America's global economic hegemony, is wobbling, and the outcome of this bitterly contested election could help determine how far, and how fast, it falls. </p> <p>With a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent of GDP, and growth prospects under threat from $50-a-barrel oil, rising interest rates and an overstretched consumer sector, experts have little doubt that the greenback is overvalued. In fact, the correction has already begun: the dollar hit an eight-month low against the euro and a six-month low against the yen last week, after a respite over the summer. The presidential election could be just the catalyst the markets have been waiting for to spark a more sustained readjustment. </p> <p>'People are bearish because of the scale of the imbalances in the economy. Historically, current account deficits of this kind have been associated with pretty major currency reversals,' says Richard Iley of BNP Paribas. </p> <p>'There is no question, the dollar is definitely going down,' says Adrian Foster, head of currency at Dresdner. </p> <p>In the very short run, what investors would most like is a clean result next week. The dollar usually bounces immediately after presidential elections, but in 2000, it fell 4 per cent on a trade-weighted basis between November and the end of the year, as Bush and Gore wrangled over 'hanging chads' and recounts. </p> <p>With teams of lawyers standing by for both camps this time, and little to choose between them in the polls, another pro tracted tussle - and another anxious month for the markets - looks likely. </p> <p>Once a victor is eventually declared, though, analysts believe a win for John Kerry could cause a short sharp shock for the greenback, while the familiar face of George W in the oval office might postpone the inevitable for a while. </p> <p>Ironically, one reason Kerry's arrival in the White House could be bearish for the dollar is that he would be more likely to try to get to grips with the $400 billion budget deficit that is Bush Jr's legacy. 'When you're a new guy in office, it's good to get your dirty work out of the way early, in terms of cutting spending, slowing the economy down,' says Steve Andrew, chief economist at F&amp;C. That could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more slowly, and put downward pressure on the dollar. </p> <p>'Kerry is broadly dollar-negative,' agrees Bill O'Neill, global strategist at JP Morgan. 'It's akin to the environment after the Reagan period, where you had fiscal consolidation and an easy Fed policy. That coincided with a soft dollar.' </p> <p>After capital controls were abolished in 1973, and the dollar was first allowed to float freely, it climbed during Gerald Ford's Republican presidency, from 1974 to 1977, and slid under Democrat Jimmy Carter, between 1977 and 1981. In the 1980s, 'Reaganomics' threw conventional left-right logic into disarray. </p> <p>Reagan initially presided over a great spike in the dollar's value, as he cut taxes and plunged into the red to pump up economic expansion. He was then persuaded that it had become too strong for the good of the US and the global economy; and in the era when currency fluctuations were a matter for international diplomacy, the G7 group of rich nations agreed to orchestrate an orderly depreciation, in what became known as the Plaza agreement of 1985. Two years later, in the so-called Louvre accord, they decided it was time to put a floor under the market. </p> <p>Under Clinton, particularly in his second term, as the fervour that underpinned the dotcom boom sparked talk of a 'new paradigm' and a 'productivity miracle', having a strong dollar became a matter of macho economic pride. </p> <p>Since the economy slid into reverse after the stock market bubble burst, the dollar has suffered, falling by about 7 per cent against other currencies on the Federal Reserve's broad index since Bush Jr's inauguration in January 2001. But analysts fear that by digging into the public coffers to reflate the economy and pull out of the dotcom downturn, Bush has stored up problems for the future. </p> <p>Both candidates have pledged to halve the huge fiscal deficit during their first term, but Kerry is seen by the markets as more committed to this goal. He has put considerable emphasis on keeping spending under control, and clearing the fiscal mess left by Bush. </p> <p>Judging by his rhetoric during the campaign, Kerry could be more protectionist, perhaps raising the pressure on the Chinese government to float its currency, the renminbi, and allow the dollar to fall against it. Much of the US's vast trade deficit is with Asia, as American consumers suck in billions of dol lars worth of cheap imports from China and Japan. US governments have argued for some time that the Chinese are gaining an unfair advantage by keeping their currency pegged to the dollar at a cheap rate. Last week's surprise move by the Chinese to push up interest rates in an attempt to guide their booming economy towards a soft landing raised hopes in the markets that their next step might be to allow the renminbi to appreciate. </p> <p>That would be a relief for the eurozone, which has so far been the main release valve for downward pressure on the dollar. In recent weeks, eurozone ministers have repeatedly suggested that they are unfazed by the idea of a strong euro, but its appreciation against the dollar is threatening to derail the fragile export-led recovery. </p> <p>The attitude of the Japanese government is also crucial: it has repeatedly propped up the dollar against the yen, and could begin doing so again once the election is out of the way. As a result, G7 meetings have once again become the forum for heated discussion about currencies. 'The G7 meetings have become a lot more important than they were: these are the most important issues facing the global economy,' says Iley. </p> <p>However, analysts fear that even if Japan continues to intervene, its strategy may not be sustainable for long. 'Not even huge intervention can stop the dollar defying gravity in our view,' said currency experts at Bear Stearns in a research note last week. 'The economics of the dollar are still poor.' </p> <p>Abandoning the long-cherished mantra of a 'strong dollar policy' would be read as a dramatic change, even if the policy means little in practice these days. But there is a growing consensus that the US cannot keep spending more than it earns, and importing more than it exports, at such an extraordinary pace. 'It's not in either candidate's best interest to actively encourage a stronger dollar right now,' says Foster. </p> <p>The adjustment may take longer to arrive if George W is in charge, but it can't be avoided for ever.</p>",
  "For Feriba Ahmadi, the morning when deportation officers came is seared in her memory. Clad in riot gear, they rammed their way into the Ghausia Jamia mosque at Stourbridge in the West Midlands, where she and her family were taking refuge. <p>For the Ahmadis, who had fled Afghanistan after being targeted by the Taliban, it was the start of a new nightmare that would see them deported to yet another strange country where they would struggle to eke out an uncertain existence below the poverty line.</p> <p>'It was 6am and my husband, Farid, and I were fast asleep,' Feriba says, barely able to hold back her tears. 'I woke up to what sounded like bombs going off and for a second I thought I was back in Afghanistan. I was totally confused because I knew I was in a place of sanctity.'</p> <p>Seconds later, in full view of a media scrum, the couple were seized and imprisoned in Handsworth, Birmingham, while friends they had made in their adopted community looked after their children, son Seear and daughter Hadia, then aged four and six.</p> <p>Locked alone in her prison room, Feriba watched news reports of their eviction. 'The government wanted to use us as a symbol, and send a message to the world that they were tough on asylum seekers. Even my poor mother, who was dying of cancer in Kabul, saw us in the newspapers. She thought we had escaped the fighting in Afghanistan to find peace in England.'</p> <p>Feriba, 26, burns with rage at how they were treated. 'We had brains, hearts and souls and all we wanted was to work and settle down in England. Instead of getting compassion, we were made out to be liars and treated like serial killers.'</p> <p>The Ahmadis were deported to Germany in August 2002. There they believed they would gain immediate rights to settle, but are still required to renew their residency permits every six months and live in a barren, soulless detention centre.</p> <p>'We have no security, no friends, no life,' says Feriba, who has been diagnosed as medically depressed.</p> <p>Home is a camp for asylum seekers on the outskirts of Landsberg, in Bavaria, where the family shares a bedroom separated from a poky kitchen and bathroom by a long, dark public corridor. On display are photos of happier times: a wedding picture, two beaming schoolgirls - one an English blonde and the other a dark-haired Afghan.</p> <p>The living room door clicks open and a girl with two thick plaits and large saucer eyes peeks in.</p> <p>Feriba feigns a smile for her daughter. Hadia plonks herself next to her mother. In fluent German - she has equally mastered English - she says she misses her friend Rosi, the bubbly blonde girl in the photograph. 'We used to play together, but now she's just my pen pal.' Abruptly, she disappears into the bedroom.</p> <p>Six-year-old Seear is rummaging through a cardboard box full of toys - a Buzz Lightyear, a Batman model, cars and plastic animals, hand-me-downs from English friends. He springs over to his mother, drinks the dregs of her cold cardamom coffee and slips off to find his sister. Feriba whispers: 'Hadia and Seear are very sad. They have no friends and feel so isolated. My son's favourite teacher in England was an Indian woman called Mrs Jasmine. Even now, he always tells me to put on my Indian dress so I look like her.'</p> <p>The nostalgia in Feriba's voice turns bitter as she recalls when she discovered her family had lost its appeal against deportation to Germany.</p> <p>The blow was delivered on Christmas Eve 2002 as a suicidal Feriba lay in a hospital bed. Although the High Court ruled there had been a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the raid on the mosque 'was proportionate to the aim of exercising an effective immigration control'.</p> <p>She says the family escaped Afghanistan after their home was bombed and Farid, 36, had been tortured by the Taliban. Her husband takes over from his now blubbering wife: 'Feriba was pregnant and we had been to visit her father. When we returned, our house was a pile of rubble. The Taliban came asking for money. They wrapped telephone cables around my big toes and gave me electric shocks.'</p> <p>He leaves the room quietly. 'It's Ramadan and my husband must pray now,' Feriba explains. She has been pre scribed anti-depressants and is too weak to fast.</p> <p>The Ahmadis say they fled Afghanistan in 2000 with visas and passports, but their paperwork and money were stolen soon after they arrived in Germany from Ukraine.</p> <p>'We were left with nothing and nowhere to turn. I was crying in the street when a policeman took us to a camp for asylum seekers. Ten months later, we all got into the back of a lorry and ended up in England.'</p> <p>They were dispersed to Lye, in Stourbridge, where they lived on a housing estate for a year. Despite campaigns to Downing Street and a 1,000-signature petition to keep them in England, the family was deported.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Landsberg office for asylum seekers said the family had been granted permission to stay until February 2005. He added that the arrangement would remain in place until German ministers met to assess the political situation in war-torn countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq.</p> <p>Farid earns \u20ac400 (\u00a3277) a month in a factory, and Feriba has completed a six-month intensive German course and two months' volunteer work at a hospital.</p> <p>'It has been one nightmare after another,' she says.</p>",
  "Moses Paramour was just 10 months old when he received his first beating at the hands of his high-flying father, Adrian Hodge. It was the start of a downward spiral during which Moses would endure years of violence, set fire to the family home, witness his mother's attempted suicide, see his brothers beaten to within an inch of their lives and finally watch his father jailed for trying to murder Moses's new stepfather. <p>Two weeks ago, no longer able to cope with the waking nightmare his life had become, Moses committed suicide. He was just 12. </p> <p>His death is the latest tragedy to strike his mother, Fiona Timothy, who was still getting over the attempted murder of her husband when the police broke the news of her son's suicide. Moses's death has also traumatised his remaining siblings: two of his brothers admit they are also thinking of killing themselves. </p> <p>Despite all they have endured, Fiona claims her family has never been given support by social services and that her children have never been offered counselling. She is calling for a public inquiry into the death of Moses, which would lead to a probe into the role of the local social services team. </p> <p>Speaking from a police safe house in Basingstoke, Fiona told The Observer : 'Last week, my 10-year-old was in his room and started crying. I went to see him and he said, \"It's all my fault, I can't carry on any more\". He was rocking and saying, \"Why won't any one help us?\" Later that same day, my 14-year-old son also said he was going to kill himself. He was saying \"there's no point living any more\".' </p> <p>Fiona was only 17 when she first met Hodge. He was nine years older and earned around \u00a3100,000 a year as a computer programmer. Showering Fiona with gifts and driving her around in his gleaming Ferrari, he soon swept her off her feet. </p> <p>Unaware that Hodge had once been jailed for beating a previous girlfriend, Fiona agreed to move in with him. Soon afterwards, Hodge's true character emerged and Fiona found herself trapped in a world of violence. At first only she was the target, but Hodge soon turned his attention to the four children the couple had together. </p> <p>Moses was a particular target. When he was 10 months old, Adrian punched him in the face, calling him a bastard after becoming convinced the child was not his own. On another occasion, he whipped Moses with the telephone cord until his legs bled. </p> <p>'I ran away several times with the children, to friends and family, anything to get away,' said Fiona, 33, 'but every time he found me and ordered me back home. He said he'd kill me and the kids if I didn't.' </p> <p>After finally breaking away from Hodge in 1996, Fiona met Alvin Timothy and within a year the pair had married. But as soon as Hodge found out, he launched a hate campaign against Fiona's new husband. </p> <p>He made threatening phone calls and broke into their house on numerous occasions. The stress drove Fiona first on to a course of antidepressants and then to attempt suicide, swallowing a handful of paracetamol. Paramedics found her and rushed her to hospital, where a stomach pump saved her life. </p> <p>All the children suffered as a result, but Moses seemed to find it particularly hard. In 2001, he set fire to a coat hanging in the hallway of the family home. The blaze went out of control. The ground floor was gutted and firefighters rescued the family from an upstairs window. Fiona believes the fire was a cry for help but, despite her objections, Moses was moved into the care of a foster family. </p> <p>Meanwhile the tension in the Timothy household continued to spiral. Hodge began making increasingly menacing phone calls to Alvin. On one occasion, he arrived at the door armed with an axe and two kitchen knives. Fiona called the police, but by the time they arrived Hodge had hidden the weapons, so they were unable to take action. Soon afterwards, the Timothys changed their name and moved into a police safe house, fitted with multiple panic alarms. </p> <p>Hodge switched tactics. He made false allegations that Alvin had been having sexual relations with a child. Hodge hired three criminals from east London to track the family down. </p> <p>Late one afternoon in November 2002, Fiona answered the door to a man asking to see Alvin, who had arrived home a few minutes earlier. Alvin was talking to the man when his accomplice leapt forward with a gun. </p> <p>'There was a blinding flash and Alvin reeled back,' Fiona recalls. 'His face was a mass of blood. I thought he'd been killed.' </p> <p>Detectives noticed that the methods the men had used matched the modus operandi of a trio of known armed robbers. Derek Danso, William Phillips and Mushbir Hussain were arrested and charged with attempted murder. </p> <p>At the trial last December, Danso gave evidence against Hodge. He said Hodge had given him \u00a37,000 in cash to kill either Fiona or Alvin. </p> <p>Alvin was no longer able to live at the house where he had been shot, but in recent weeks he and Fiona had found new jobs and were planning to live together once more. </p> <p>Moses also seemed to be thriving at the foster home. On 19 October, he bought a Manchester United quilt cover for his bed and enjoyed a McDonald's meal. But later that afternoon, his foster family found him hanging from the door knob of his bedroom. He had made a noose from the cord of his dressing gown. </p> <p>Fiona places the blame for Moses's death at the door of the authorities. 'Hampshire social services and Hampshire police put my child where he is now because they didn't listen to him. It's been that way for the whole of his life. Moses told me the demons in his head wouldn't stop. For what happened to Moses, I want a public inquiry. They are just trying to sweep this under the carpet. That's what they've always done. They haven't listened to me and my children for all these years. They won't cover up what's happened to my family.' </p> <p>Hampshire social services was unavailable for comment yesterday.</p>",
  "Eleven o'clock on a Friday morning, and a knot of neighbours stands round another smashed car window. What shall we do? We could call our local anti-social behaviour co-ordinator and demand that an interim Asbo be served. We could try the anti-social behaviour hotline. <p>Or we could sidestep the Asbo industry, ring Autoglass and remember the \u00a36 rule. That is the going rate for a fix of crack and thus a vital unit of local currency. According to the police, prostitutes charge \u00a36, which sounds tragically low. Our visiting anti-social behaviourist - most probably a sad kid on a bike - will break into cars for anything that will raise \u00a36 to spend at the crack house which the Prime Minister should be closing any moment now. </p> <p>Eradicating such establishments is part of the anti-yob drive announced last week. So is better drug treatment. But these worthy, difficult aims seemed secondary to an explosion of Asbos and other eye-catching schemes, some administered by amateur law-enforcers. Parish council wardens, the Bow Street Runners of their age, will soon be able to issue \u00a3100 on-the-spot fines for dog-fouling, littering and graffiti. </p> <p>If such problems are secondary on the streets of Falluja, they are not necessarily a big deal in Frinton either. The British Crime Survey shows that people are much more worried about speeding cars and illegal parking than rubbish or vandalism. Only 9 per cent worry about noisy neighbours. Obviously squalor and low-level disorder are a problem, but they require a sense of proportion. </p> <p>Half of the 2,633 Asbos handed out last year went to under-18s, of whom a third broke the conditions and so faced prison. The move to increase pilot areas from 10 to 60 will inevitably send more young people to jail. Given that 85 per cent reoffend when they are let out, this seems an odd way of delivering Nirvana Avenue to badland Britain. </p> <p>Asbology is the least precise of sciences. No one, Mr Blair included, has a clue whether the orders work. No research exists, and no evidence underpins the vast expansion of the anti-social behaviour programme. If medicine was tested like this, the NHS would be still be treating flu with leeches. There are plenty of indicators, though, that Asbos might often do more harm than good. </p> <p>The Chief Constable of South Wales warns they should only be used as a very last report. Nacro and Rethinking Crime and Punishment caution against making children pariahs, and everyone knows converting troublemakers into criminals is a one-way street. Despite talk of tackling drugs, the suspicion is that the Government is abandoning welfare for retribution and the politics of fear. </p> <p>Something bigger than low-level yobbery is going on. Called pre-election hype, it is centred on communities and crime. Anti-social behaviour is the ideal focus, because it is both vague and fixable. The Government can be certain of a result, not because its methods are good, but because crime is falling anyway, for reasons ranging from better locks to shrewder policing. Figures out this month showed reported burglaries down 23 per cent and robbery and gun killings cut by 15 per cent. </p> <p>David Blunkett says public silence at this success is 'a subject of perpetual woe' but, if people are constantly told they are at risk, they are obviously less likely to notice feeling safer. This gives the Government a dilemma. It cannot promise all-out war on miscreants while simultaneously acknowledging modest progress towards peace. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett concedes he is walking 'a tightrope'. To maintain balance - and logic - he calls fear of anti-social behaviour the 'white noise' that stops voters noticing that no one has recently mugged their granny. That might be convincing, but for the Crime Survey's finding that fear of anti-social behaviour is dropping. </p> <p>The Government seems determined to batter such complacency. Apart from the Asbo epidemic, Mr Blair has announced, to general uproar, that more juries in child abuse and theft cases will hear of previous convictions. Leading judges privately blame 'Home Office spin' for resurrecting a battle the judiciary fought and lost last year. Mr Blair is only recycling, as part of his pre-election strategy, a measure that, however undesirable, is already on the statute book. </p> <p>Swagger and anxiety are contagious. In the wake of the stabbing of Robert Symons, a London teacher, the Tories have joined a call for the law to be 'rebalanced' so that householders can protect themselves against criminals. This recalibration, a shorthand for allowing armed vigilantes to maim or kill, appeals to few victims. The elderly and the frightened, who have neither the wish nor the toys to play Terminator, want burglars never to arrive or, failing that, to be caught quickly, tried efficiently and persuaded not to reoffend. </p> <p>But better detection and drug treatment for the majority of burglars who steal to feed a habit are less newsworthy than rifle-packing pensioners, such as Kenneth Faulkner. According to a neighbour, Mr Faulkner was a peaceful man who had guns merely to keep rabbits and deer off his vegetables until he shot a burglar in the knee. </p> <p>Far from facing charges, or an Asbo, he was commended for acting 'sensibly' by Judge Andrew Hamilton. It will be interesting to see how Hamilton reacts if confronted with cases involving dead have-a-go householders or petty thieves with bullets in the brain. </p> <p>Labour's hysteria over crime and disorder is a come-on to campaigners who argue that prison works and firearms work better. Look at gun-slinging America, where you can sleep with your windows open and the keys in the Hummer, and where murders are up three per cent to 16,503 a year. </p> <p>The Home Office, sensibly, rejects calls for a new law on self-defence. The trouble is that Mr Blunkett cannot simultaneously be the voice of reason and of doom. Either Britain is a hellish country redeemable only by the Asbo and the gun or, more plausibly, it is a relatively safe place marred by some dangerous people and grim areas. Since each Asbo costs \u00a35000 to administer, and jailing a child for a year is \u00a350,000, curtailing both would pay for more dedicated workers and youth centres to deal with unruly teenagers and so help those whose lives they mar. </p> <p>In addition, the middle classes should stop pretending, patronisingly, that they are only worried about the poor. In roads like mine, people treat a smashed window as evidence of Armageddon, even though everyone feels more secure than they once did. Conversely, there is often little enthusiasm on sink estates for coercive measures, partly because people do not want to see their relatives or friends ostracised or in jail. </p> <p>David Blunkett knows all about such neighbourhoods, and he wants, quite genuinely, to 'empower' them. That makes it all the more odd that he does not grasp the impossibility of rebuilding communities by wrenching them apart. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@observer.co.uk\">mary.riddell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "His death at a bleak road junction in Germany seemed destined to remain shrouded in mystery. Shortly after leaving a meeting staged by far-right extremists, British student Jeremiah Duggan inexplicably ran in front of speeding traffic. Now the chain of events that led to the 22-year-old sustaining fatal head injuries early one morning on a Wiesbaden ring road are to be re-examined by police. <p>For his mother, Erica, it is the culmination of an 18-month battle to discover what happened during her son's final days. </p> <p>All she did know was that her Jewish son would never return home after becoming embroiled with the LaRouche organisation, a shadowy cult led by a convicted fraudster with virulent anti-Semitic views. When police broke the news that Duggan had died they urged Erica 'to go nowhere near those people, they are dangerous.' </p> <p>It was advice quickly ignored. Driven by a desire for truth, the retired teacher began a one-woman investigation that would take her into the political orbit of a group obsessed with conspiracy theories, apocalyptic prophesies and extreme political ideology. </p> <p>Over the months Erica, 58, has tracked down 20 former members of the LaRouche group from as far afield as Australia and Canada. Each interview corroborates allegations of mind control and intimidation, substantiating a Scotland Yard internal report that the movement seems to be a 'political cult with sinister and dangerous connections'. More than \u00a350,000 raised from selling her home funded her quest, but this has now run out. </p> <p>Yesterday speaking from her parents' house in Golders Green, north London, where a study holds 30 box-files of notes, testimonies and observations, she said: 'The pain never goes away, sometimes I am out and a tremendous wave of grief washes over me. There have been times when I have nearly given up, especially after talking to people damaged after contact with LaRouche. Now I feel confident that we are heading towards the truth.' </p> <p>German police long maintained the case was closed, saying Duggan hurled himself in front of fast-moving vehicles on 27 March last year. Now German prosecutors have told government officials they plan to re-open the investigation. They have been told about new evidence compiled by Erica and her lawyers that raises grave questions over their initial verdict that he took his own life. </p> <p>Duggan, recognisable for his mop of dark curly hair and wide smile, was known as a young man who loved life. However when the talented tennis player called his mother just 35 minutes before his death, he sounded terrified. The former pupil of Christ's Hospital school in Sussex told Erica he was in 'big trouble'. Asked where he was, Duggan began spelling out Wiesbaden. Before he could reach 'b' the phone line went dead. </p> <p>On the night of his death, Duggan attended a conference protesting against the Iraq war, which had started eight days earlier. The meeting was organised by the Schiller Institute, an extreme political group linked to LaRouche that shared a deep anti-Semitic streak. The institute is led by Lyndon LaRouche, a US right-wing conspiracy theorist once sentenced to 15 years in prison for fraud and who stood in this year's presidential elections. The 82-year-old had spoken at the conference attended by Duggan that night. </p> <p>Newsletters written by LaRouche supporters have recently attacked the British government and, in particular, Foreign Office minister Baroness Symons. The Foreign Office yesterday ruled out taking action against the organisation, but confirmed that German authorities are 'actively considering reopening the investigation' into Duggan's death. </p> <p>Among new findings that focus largely on the exploits of LaRouche, drivers who hit Duggan have been questioned and suggest a man running for his life as opposed to one intent on taking it. Psychoanalysis of the behaviour of Duggan before he arrived in Wiesbaden yielded no suggestion of suicidal tendencies. Scrutiny of his last moments indicate a man 'running without thought' substantiating theories that he was terrified. Lawyers are exploring the notion that when the student died he was not in control of his mind. </p> <p>Leading German lawyer Nikolas Becker, who defended former East German leader Erich Honecker over killings at the Berlin Wall, is convinced the new investigation will open soon. 'We have enough evidence now. Erica's persistence is extraordinary, there are very few people like her,' said Becker. </p> <p>Jackie Turner, of Christian Khan solicitors in London, who is working closely with the Foreign Office, described new findings as 'highly probative'. She dismissed the initial investigation by the German authorities as inadequate. No official witness statements were collected by police while his clothing was destroyed immediately. Even so, a verdict of suicide was quickly reached. </p> <p>Turner said: 'It is clear that only a full and detailed reinvestigation can now serve the purposes of justice and to establish how Jeremiah came by his tragic and premature death'. </p> <p>Erica is concerned that only the smallest delay could persuade more youngsters in the meantime to join LaRouche's youth movement. 'How many more people might be harmed?' she said. </p> <p>Tomorrow, Erica will join six parents who have also lost sons or daughters after becoming mixed up with cults at a meeting with Home Office officials. The first such meeting for years has been viewed as an attempt by the Home Office to dispel accusations that it has failed to treat the problem seriously. The government has also begun discussions with universities to distribute warnings to students on the dangers of cults. </p> <p>Former Home Office Minister Tom Sackville said: 'This is very symbolic, the fact the government is starting to take the issue seriously is very important.' There are some 500 cults active in the UK and, according to conservative analysis, 500,000 Britons have been or are in contact with one. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mark.townsend@observer.co.uk\">mark.townsend@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>'If I were British and with a brain in my head, I would come to Russia and make money.' So says Oleg Tinkov, founder of Moscow's Tinkoff beer company. The louche thirtysomething speaks for the 'other' face of Russian business - one far removed, apparently, from tax-dodging oil billionaires and crony capitalism. </p> <p>He was joined at a meeting with The Observer last week by Russia's 'Mr Ketchup'. 'I don't need to know the people in power to do business,' purred Alexei Antipov, head of sauces firm Baltimor Holding. 'I don't even know who my local governor is.' </p> <p>And here's another thrusting young entrepreneur, Alexander Kosyanenko of the supermarket chain JSC Perekriostok: 'The future of business here is with those who create new brands and new products. It does not lie with those who take money out of the country. </p> <p>'I know people who have failed in the US and Europe, but they come over here and succeed. The banks have money to lend, but Russian people don't know how to ask the banks - they lack the education to do it. So this is a moment of unique opportunity for foreigners.' </p> <p>The headline figures seem to tell a similar story. Buoyed by soaring oil and commodity prices, Russia's economy is growing by more than 7 per cent a year. Manufacturing and retail are in good shape, and there is talk about joining the World Trade Organisation, and streamlining Russia's vast bureaucracy. </p> <p>One year on from the startling arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the country's premier 'oligarch', big deals are being done. ConocoPhillips, the US oil major, was given the go-ahead last month to buy 8 per cent of Lukoil for $2 billion; BP's $13.5bn venture with Russia's TNK seems to be proceeding smoothly; even Scottish &amp; Newcastle has bought a 37.5 per cent stake in Baltika, the St Petersburg brewery. </p> <p>'Since the debt crisis of 1998 there's a lot less lying going on,' says Charlie Ryan, chief executive of the United Financial Group, a Moscow-based investment bank. 'The grey economy still accounts for 35-40 per cent of the whole economic story here, but many companies have become transparent in their accounts and their taxes. Tax rates are quite favourable anyway, so there is less money in mattresses than before.' </p> <p>The experience of Sibir Energy, however, is less reas suring. The London-listed oil and exploration group revealed this year that a \u00a3100m stake it thought it held in a Russian oilfield had been mysteriously 'diluted'. </p> <p>And while BP and Conoco may be big enough to withstand nasty surprises, there is a feeling that Russia remains an inhospitable climate for smaller players nervous about corruption, an unresponsive court system and outright gangsterism. </p> <p>Foreign direct investment will top $8bn this year; but that is still less than the sums attracted by the Czech Republic. Capital flight is a problem too: to judge from the number of wealthy Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s snapping up Chelsea town houses, it is clear that even the native elite worries about its future security in the 'Wild East'. </p> <p>The other fear, of course, is of the Kremlin, and the unpredictable inclinations of Vladimir Putin. Russia's president is surrounded by liberal economists, but his approach to domestic and security matters is undeniably authoritarian, and in the past year Putin has shown interest in taking control of Russia's business life as well. </p> <p>Recently it was announced that Gazprom, the state-run gas monopoly, would merge with oil firm Rosneft to create a 51 per cent government-owned energy monolith. It's a momentous deal, not just in size but also in its implications for the likes of Britain, which anticipates importing most of its gas from Russia in decades to come. </p> <p>Some optimists have lauded the merger, arguing it puts the all-important gas industry on a more secure footing and at least allows Westerners to invest in up to 49 per cent of Gazprom. Last week Alexander Medvedev, a Gazprom board member, added: 'We are open for the exchange of views and opinions. We are going international now.' But senior diplomats in Moscow are worried. One said: 'This merger is about power and pride, and making Russia great again. Gazprom could soon be technically the biggest company in the world.' </p> <p>And then, of course, there is the Khodorkovsky affair. Russia's formerly richest man languishes in jail on fraud and corruption charges relating to the Yeltsin-era firesale of state assets that made him rich. Meanwhile Yukos, his oil company, faces crippling tax demands and is likely to be auctioned off. </p> <p>Whatever one's view of Khodorkovsky, most agree he is the victim of a political campaign designed to silence and punish his previously vocal criticism of Putin. The affair has left would-be foreign investors with questions about arbitrary government and the president's commitment to private ownership. </p> <p>'What's happening to Yukos has slowed up mergers and acquisitions activity, definitely,' says a senior US banker in Moscow. 'Foreign companies now think they have to secure a \"permission slip\" from the Kremlin before they proceed with a deal.' </p> <p>Mindful, perhaps, of Khodorkovsky's fate, senior business people steer clear of politics, or even political discussion. Take Sergei Bogdanchikov, president of Rosneft, who said simply that Yukos was 'not my business' last week. When asked if his company's merger with Gazprom indicated Russia was on the road to 'state capitalism,' he replied: 'I'm not a member of the State Duma. I don't really care what kind of capitalism it is.' </p> <p>Leonid Fedun, vice-president of Lukoil, was also reluctant to discuss the Yukos affair in detail. Peter Aven, the chairman of Alfa Bank, said he was 'not scared personally' to get into political matters. 'But clients don't like it. If I am in politics, the bank is less stable, that's for sure... Either you are in politics or you are in business.' </p> <p>Shuttling around Russia's capital city from boardroom to boardroom, however, it was striking just how many of these leading businessmen have political backgrounds: Aven himself was a minister in Boris Yeltsin's government. Even some of the most influential voices of the opposition, such as Alexander Lebedev and Boris Nemtsov, have combined sniping against Putin with profitable careers in business. </p> <p>It's a salutary reminder that the connection between earning power and political influence remains abnormally strong in Putin's Russia; and that, despite the occasional 'Mr Ketchup', Russia's new wealth has not been distributed far beyond the trendy bars and shopping centres of central Moscow. </p> <p>Although oil tax revenues have handed the government huge budget surpluses, it has resisted calls to spend these tens of billions of dollars on major infrastructure projects or on jump-starting Russia's ailing industries. Fearful that the money will be swallowed up in bureaucracy, Putin's men are instead using it to reduce the national debt. </p> <p>Meanwhile the country's moribund retail banking centre remains largely unreformed. After numerous currency devaluations, ordinary people don't save. Mortgages and insurance products are not widely available; loans for budding entrepreneurs certainly are not. </p> <p>Little wonder, perhaps, that an estimated 30m Russians live in poverty, with mortality rates actually rising since Soviet times. And little wonder that businessmen, foreign or domestic, are not widely loved.</p>",
  "The real puzzle in next Tuesday's presidential election is why George W Bush is not going to get hammered. Tens of millions of ordinary Americans live in more economic insecurity and enjoy less opportunity as a result of the America he is building. Abroad he is leading his country into a dangerous and unwinnable confrontation with Islamic fundamentalism that obstructs the rooting out of terrorism, whose crassness is exposed daily in the flow of news from Iraq. A grass roots revolt should throw him out of office as an incompetent. <p>And yet most polls give him the lead over challenger John Kerry by a narrow margin. The incumbency effect is part of the explanation, as is the skill with which Bush has played the security card. But the deeper truth is that conservative America has become a formidable cultural and electoral force - and it offers its allegiance to George Bush instinctively and unhesitatingly.</p> <p>Even if Kerry manages to win, American conservatism will remain the most dynamic component in American political life. Although a Kerry victory (for which I hope) is conceivable, it is already clear that the race is so tight that the Republicans will retain their grip on the House of Representatives - with little prospect of an early reversal. Talk to Republicans and they regard their control of the House together with more state legislatures as the heart of their power base; in the checked and balanced US political system the presidency is the necessary but insufficient condition for political leadership.</p> <p>In short, a Kerry victory would only be the end of the beginning; for the Democrats to move the US even marginally from its current hardening right-wing trajectory, the long-term task is the rebuilding and sustaining of the liberal coalition that they held from Roosevelt's New Deal to the end of the 1960s - and which will allow them to challenge what is now a Republican legislative dominance. That requires not just political energy and a mobilisation on the ground that the Democrats have only just begun to demonstrate - it also means winning the battle of ideas, where they are still at first base.</p> <p>The scale of the challenge - and the political and intellectual embeddedness of US conservatism - is still not properly grasped. And why, despite his monumental mistakes and gawky malapropisms, Bush is still the narrow favourite to win?</p> <p>I got a clearer idea why in a debate at the Oxford Union on Thursday night; speaking for Bush's re-election was Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and one of the leaders of the American Conservative revolution. Norquist's rhetoric made little impact on his quintessentially British liberal audience - our pro-Kerry side was to win four to one - but you could see how effective his pitch would be in the US. The Democrats were a coalition of the liberal elite and the two wings of the 'Dependency Movement', he declaimed - those who receive welfare and those who administer it. When somebody got a job and became a Republican (working and being a Republican were coterminous) they quickly saw the case for paying less or no tax. The Republican base was at bottom about industrious, self-starting business people and workers who didn't want government to tell them what to do or spend so much of their money. Bush would continue to deliver to this constituency. Vote for him. </p> <p>We've heard pitches for lower taxes before, but an Oliver Letwin or even John Redwood doesn't do it with the same sting or passion. What gives Norquist its bitter, cutting edge is the depth of his complaint. He's on the side of the ordinary American and the common man against the liberal elite and the do-gooders. They're the wine drinkers, the French speakers, the interferers in American lives, the indulgers of homosexuals, the mockers of faith and the upholders of political correctness.</p> <p>Norquist is on the side of working Americans living in the outer suburbs springing up like topsy around every US city; the network of soulless shopping malls, never-ending cloned streets and newly built churches created by the appetite of US property developers. These instant developments are communities only in name; their rootless inhabitants, questing for meaning in their lives, are the prey upon which the New Republicanism feeds.</p> <p>Its success, as Thomas Frank writes in his compelling book What's the Matter with America? , is that it has used largely cultural symbols - against irreligion, abortion, gun control, stem-cell research - to build a new working-class constituency that believes an allegedly hegemonic liberal elite wants to do down what working America holds dear.</p> <p>They will build national parks on farmland, mandate special holidays for transgendered war veterans, decree only gay couples can adopt children, as part of the same world view that wants to control gun use and get UN resolutions to act in Iraq. Thus the working class becomes the ally of a party that gives tax cuts to the top 1 per cent and is set on undermining the institutions that try to offer working Americans security and opportunity. The irony could not be more complete.</p> <p>Frank sees no end in sight, largely because the secular forces unleashed by American capitalism are so powerful. This is the genius of the conservative position. It is a crusade fuelled by a never-ending tide of complaint that is compelled to set itself unachievable objectives in its battle to reduce women's rights and against the commercial ethic that so beleaguers religion but their non-achievement only proves the malevolent hegemony of the liberal elite and thus the correctness of the right's analysis.</p> <p>THIS HOSTILITY to modernity and sense of beleaguerment spills over to fuel an ugly American nationalism. Foreigners, and especially Muslim foreigners, are part of the threat to the values and lifestyles of ordinary God-fearing Americans. To cast the response to 11September as a war on terror not only offers a route to achieving American security; it enlists, as Bush knows full well, this new American nationalism to the cause and thus the side of militant Republicanism. To understand his campaign - speeches laced with biblical references, solidarity over every right-wing cultural icon, commitment to cut taxes and insistence he is the right commander-in-chief to lead the US in its war on terror - you need to understand the new forces underpinning American conservatism.</p> <p>Kerry and the Democrats confront a Hydra. They have assets - America's knowledge workers, Hispanics and blacks are all massively Democrat; a significant part of America's working class do understand which party represents their interests and are dubious about rabid conservatism.</p> <p>The good news is that this liberal coalition is giving Bush's Republican party such an effective challenge; the bad news is that it is not more effective still. Win or lose on Tuesday, progressive America still has a lot to do - but it would be better to start by winning.</p>",
  "<p>Much of the most interesting, most urgent film-making of the past couple of years, especially in North America, has been in the documentary field, and the majority of the films are directly or obliquely political. They're a reaction, in part at least, against the false balance and censorship of TV, against the blandness of mainstream cinema and the solipsism and social disengagement of small-scale, independent productions. And they appeal to us because we live in a world of spin and image manipulation that makes it increasingly difficult to recognise what is real and authentic.</p> <p>The most striking success this year, of course, has been Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 , winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes and a box-office success the world over. But there's also been My Architect, Capturing the Friedmans, Super Size Me, The Fog of War, The Control Room, and now The Corporation, a long, sharp, polemical work, co-directed by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott and written by Joel Bakan, all of whom, as Canadians, bring a particular critical perspective to bear upon the United States.</p> <p>Abbott and Achbar are film-makers with a specific interest in the environment, the ecology and globalisation. Bakan is a lawyer and the author of a book on corporations with the blunt subtitle, 'The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power' which announces the film's central thrust. The movie argues that over the past 150 years business corporations have steadily grown to dominate the world, determining lives, overriding governments, depleting the world's resources, polluting the atmosphere. In the United States, lawyers, who are a form of corporate heavy artillery, took the Four teenth Amendment of the Constitution, originally designed to protect free slaves, and used it to have corporations attain the legal status of persons. But they are persons designed, and legally compelled, to pursue profit without concern for the human consequences. </p> <p>The film is hard-hitting but not hectoring, and among the 40-odd witnesses are eloquent spokesmen for capitalism, among them the gnome-like Milton Friedman, Lady Thatcher's favourite economist and the most right-wing person ever to win a Nobel Prize, and the likeable Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, former chairman of Shell. Sir Mark's home (as shown in some TV footage) was besieged by ecological commandos, who ended up being entertained to a picnic-cum-seminar on the family lawn. </p> <p>The movie and most of its contributors make a distinction between the people who run organisations and the institutions themselves. The most striking person in the film, a hero of sorts, is Ray Anderson, the CEO of Interface, the largest carpet manufacturer, who has been converted to the cause of sustainability and has made this the test of all his company's activities. But in one of the most amusing of the film's dozen chapters, the corporation itself as an entity is subjected to a psychiatric examination and diagnosed as a classic psychopath.</p> <p>One of the chapters, 'The Price of Whistleblowing', initially seems to be something of a diversion from the movie's main theme. It examines the case of two investigative journalists, Jane Akre and Steve Wilson, hired by Fox News, Rupert Murdoch's TV channel, and then put through legal hell when they made a programme exposing a synthetic hormone marketed by Monsanto to boost milk production. They highlighted the potential health risk of the product, to both cows and milk drinkers. But after threats from Monsanto's lawyers, Fox itself pursued the journalists, although a jury was persuaded that their claims had been true. This incident not only exposes the way in which conglomerates work together to protect their mutual interests, but also explains why Achbar, Abbott and Bakan don't work for the likes of Murdoch.</p> <p>This is a movie to see, ponder and discuss. It's disturbing but, ultimately, not despairing. It points to ways in which people can fight back. Just to hear an American corporate adviser say that the ultimate goal of capitalism is to have someone (preferably a corporation) own every square inch of the globe makes the blood boil and encourages one to seek some kind of action. </p> <p>A major question raised is why so many people now believe that anything privately run for profit is preferable to anything publicly run for the general good. The members of our corporation-loving government would be healthier for exposing both their minds and consciences to this film.</p>",
  "An Observer investigation in the United States has uncovered widespread allegations of electoral abuse, many of them going uninvestigated despite complaints of what would appear to be criminal attempts to manipulate voter lists. <p>The allegations, which come just two days before Americans go to the polls in one of the most tightly contested elections in a generation, threaten to plunge Tuesday's count into a legal minefield and overshadow even the elections of 2000. </p> <p>The claims come as both Republicans and Democrats put in place up to 2,000 lawyers across the country to challenge attempts to manipulate the vote in swing states. </p> <p>Although allegations of misconduct have been levelled at both parties recently, the majority of complaints that have been identified in The Observer' s investigation involved claims against local Republicans. </p> <p>The claims, made by the BBC's Newsnight, follow alleged attempts by Republicans to illegally suppress the votes in key states. Republican spokesmen deny these allegations. </p> <p>One of the more serious claims is that no action has been taken in a complex fraud, where more than 4,000 Florida students were allegedly conned into signing a form which could lead them to be doubly registered and void their votes. The Florida Law Enforcement Department has told the complainants that it is too busy to investigate. </p> <p>In Colorado too, Democrats are complaining about an attempt to remove up to 6,000 convicted felons from the electoral roll, at the behest of the state's Republican secretary of state, Donetta Davidson, despite a US federal law that prohibits eliminating a voter's rights within 90 days of an election to give time for the voter to protest. </p> <p>The attempt to purge the list of alleged felons would appear to be a re-run of the attempt by Florida Governor Jeb Bush's secretary of state to remove 93,000 citizens from voter rolls as felon convicts are not allowed to vote. </p> <p>Investigations appear to have established that only 3 per cent of the largely African-American list were illegal voters. </p> <p>That action led to a vote in July by the US Civil Rights Commission to open a criminal and civil investigation of the Jeb Bush administration's purge of voters, including indications of concealing evidence subpoenaed by the commission's investigators. The new claims follow the Newsnight revelation last week of confidential documents from inside Republican headquarters in Florida and Washington which the programme claimed suggested a plan - possibly in violation of US law - to stop thousands of African-Americans from voting on election day. </p> <p>The programme produced two leaked emails, prepared for the executive director of the Bush campaign in Florida and the campaign's national research director in Washington DC, containing a 15-page list. The list contains 1,886 names and addresses of voters in predominantly black and traditionally Democratic areas of Jacksonville, Florida. </p> <p>An elections supervisor in Tallahassee, when shown the list, told Newsnight: 'The only possible reason why they would keep such a thing is to challenge voters on election day.' </p> <p>Ion Sancho, not affiliated with any party, noted that Florida law allows political party operatives inside polling stations to stop voters from obtaining a ballot. They may then only vote 'provisionally' after signing an affidavit attesting to their legal voting status. </p> <p>Mass challenges have never occurred in Florida. Indeed, says Mr Sancho, not one challenge has been made to a voter 'in the 16 years I've been supervisor of elections. Quite frankly, this process can be used to slow down the voting process and cause chaos on election day and discourage voters from voting.' </p> <p>Sancho calls it intimidation. And it may be illegal. In Washington, well-known civil rights attorney Ralph Neas noted that US federal law prohibits the targeting voters, even if there is a basis for the challenge, if race is a factor in targeting the voters. </p> <p>The list of Jacksonville voters covers an area with a majority of black residents. </p> <p>When asked by Newsnight for an explanation of the list, Republican spokespeople claimed that the list merely records returned mail from either fundraising solicitations or newly registered voters to verify addresses for purposes of campaign literature. </p> <p>Republican state campaign spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker Fletcher, stated the list was not put together 'in order to create' a challenge list, but refused to say it would not be used in that manner. </p> <p>The Observer has found that many people are soldiers sent overseas. Republicans acknowledge the list was created by compiling lists of voters whose addresses have changed whose only use, say critics, would be to challenge voters on election day on the basis that their voting address is not valid. But this 'caging' method captures those whose addresses have changed because they have been sent to Iraq or other places. The list includes homeless shelter residents, casting doubt on suggestions the list was created from fundraising solicitations for the Bush-Cheney campaign.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Shooting History</strong><br>by Jon Snow<br>HarperCollins \u00a320, pp395</p> <p>Britain's answer to Dan Rather (and, indeed, to the entire School of Cronkite) is the son of a C of E bishop who worked his way haplessly through minor public schools and Scarborough Technical College. His A-level haul makes no sort of grade. Liverpool University eventually grew tired of too much pastiche Cohn-Benditry and threw him out. Yet there Jon Snow sits today: the anchormen's anchorman, a voice of cool judgment amid the cacophony.</p> <p>Why, in mid-career, does anyone write an autobiography? This isn't your last word, nor yet the drawing of a line between one phase of life and another. Snow will be there again on Channel 4 News this week, wearing another collection of peacock ties. The real point of this exercise, then, is to tell us more about himself and the skills he brings to his job. Mission accomplished.</p> <p>The bulk of Shooting History is just that - memories and reflections from one of television's most formidably active foreign correspondents. Ethiopia, El Salvador, the Afghanistan the Red Army won and lost? Been there, done that.</p> <p>Indeed, from Washington to Hong Kong to Kosovo, you can find precious few hot spots Snow hasn't covered. The middle reaches of this book are part history fluently recalled and part high-quality travelogue. That isn't, though, what gives it a special quality. What we learn, and need to know, is much more about Snow.</p> <p>A necessary introduction. The Channel 4 Snow, toiling away night after night over a full decade and a half now, is a remarkable operator. He's much more than a newsreader. He understands what's happening and thus what he's reading; he has clearly been part of the editing process; he provides intellectual underpinning on demand. Is that Alastair Campbell storming unbidden and unheralded into the studio? Snow will handle him. But, equally, he isn't a Paxman, launching combative interviews while keeping his own views suitably elliptical by BBC tradition. Snow is a classic liberal, never afraid to let us see where he's coming from. We know what he stands for and relate to it, but we also know that he's a professional who doesn't let his prejudices get in the way.</p> <p>There's the American parallel. The big networks use master presenters such as Rather and Peter Jennings to give the evening news continuity and context. Understanding and, to a certain extent, the reassurance of familiarity is their business. They're friends dropping in to seek our trust (and losing it disastrously on occasion). Jon Snow, too, invites trust from his 7 pm regulars.</p> <p>So the early years when dad (pre-bishopric) was headmaster of Ardingly in West Sussex, a Fifties world of woolly pullovers, crackling gramophones, petrol ration books and no TV - except for the coronation - are important sighting shots through a haze of pipe and wood smoke.</p> <p>The Snows had top-drawer connections without top-drawer means. Who's that old gent in his usual Sunday evensong pew? 'This is the Prime Minister, Jon', says dad. And SuperMac shakes a youthful hand.</p> <p>Politics - both religious and standard - was part of the mix. Donald Coggan and Trevor Huddleston came to stay. Big George Snow walked pretty tall in his chosen patch. When he wrote to the Times, they jumped to attention.</p> <p>In the Sixties, swinging into action at last, we used to talk about 'the establishment'. The Snows were establishment - and Jon, naturally enough, turned rebel. That was his Liverpool phase, enriched and radicalised by a VSO stint in Uganda.</p> <p>After the university, cheesed off by one demo too many, rusticated him, he answered Lord Longford's call and ran a centre for young drug addicts in Soho. Enter the Prince of Wales, seeking good causes. Enter a few first chances of broadcasting and a switch to radio reporting at LBC. Enter a job offer from ITN. And the point is that none of it seems cynical or febrile.</p> <p>Snow worked a long stint with his young drug addicts. He went back, a few years ago, to the Uganda school that he first taught in, and feels sorrow and pity for the devastation Aids has left behind. He is human being as well as TV being. He's grounded and experienced.</p> <p>The scrapes and scoops in countless wars aren't the heart of things here, and nor are occasional bouts of editorial commentary about post-Cold War orders. If we're to trust him as a guide, we need to trust him as a man. So he lays himself modestly (as well as perceptively and entertainingly) on the line - and he earns that trust.</p>",
  "<p>Of the Bible's many stories, Noah's ark has attracted some of the nuttiest discourse, with woo-woo archaeologists digging for diluvial timbers and scholars of the occult scouring ancient texts for references to similar vessels. It's this same story that David Maine amplifies in <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=184195537X\">The Flood</a> (Canongate, \u00a312, pp259), his ribald fable of family life, longlisted for the Guardian First Book Award.</p> <p>Drawing on the Douay Bible, published in France in 1609, Maine recasts 600-year-old Noah as Noe and beads his story with quotes from Genesis. Don't expect radical departures from the original narrative: the ark is built, the animals board two-by-two, and then comes the rain, 'the desert giving off a surprised wet-sand smell'. It likewise ends with the shame of Noe's drunken nakedness (he is 'scrawny like a featherless hen', his son Sem notes, emasculating him with words), but along the way, Maine slips in anarchic anachronisms, rendering the flood 'the world's biggest demolition job' and Noe's grandchildren 'twerps'.</p> <p>In recent years there has been a steady trickle of novelistic retellings of bible stories, from Jenny Diski's Only Human (and its sequel) to Anita Diamant's The Red Tent. Most stem from a piously 'her-story' viewpoint, but while Maine passes the narrative equally between characters and invents names for Noe's hitherto unnamed daughters-in-law, he is concerned with proving the humanity of all.</p> <p>The tireless 'rutting' of Noe's three sons underscores their oneness with the animals on board, yet it is their timelessly human responses that are most surprising: the niggling provoked by life in cramped quarters; the loneliness of their 'Why?'; the way they leave trails of stones when they separate, hoping to someday find one another.</p> <p>Witty and well-paced, this is a tale that never loses sight of its gift of a plot. As Japheth says: 'We'll have a Hell of a story for the grandkids'. It is also unexpectedly moving, and all the more so for its modest aspirations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=0007183666\">Happy Accidents</a> (Fourth Estate, \u00a310.99, pp361), Tiffany Murray's comic novel, is set on dry land - just. These are the Welsh borders, and splashes of sunshine can be misleading; as Kate Happy, our 11-year-old heroine observes of some picnickers, 'as soon as they sit down, they'll sink in the wet, like anchors with their chains snapped'. Along with her whip-cracking dialogue, it is quirky images such as this that are Murray's forte.</p> <p>The Happy family is just as scattered as Noe's becomes after the flood. Having mown down her husband in a Triumph Spitfire, Kate's globe-trotting mother has abandoned her on the family farm. There she lives with her 'Yank' granny, a Coney Island war bride still homesick for bagels and lox 38 years on, and her very British grandpa, a former naval commander who bellows nothing but seafaring commands.</p> <p>Murray evokes a pungently recognisable time and place, capturing the Wild West feel of these rackety Border towns and lashing it to early Eighties pop references like music and recipes. The farm itself is very Stella Gibbons, but Kate's gran and the Happy clan's endless eccentricities make it Murray's own. Like all rambling old family piles, the Happy's has ghosts and an attic, where Kate finds her father's ashes in a Hellmann's mayonnaise jar, a wad of unused tickets to JFK, and the relics of her Gran's 'Chewishness'.</p> <p>Happy Accidents is not quite a coming-of-age fable, since we part with Kate as she teeters on the verge of her teens, but there are weddings, funerals and fond farewells, as well as some more darkly disturbing episodes. 'You know?', Kate's gran asks her towards the end, 'You're such a little kid sometimes. Think we all forget that?' That we readers don't is what gives the novel its necessary sombreness, throwing the freewheeling antics of the Happys into hilarious relief.</p> <p>The Walkers are the family at the heart of John Bemrose's astonishingly self-possessed first novel, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=0719566592\">The Island Walkers</a> (John Murray, \u00a317.99, pp431), its setting a small Canadian town named Attawan. Nowadays Attawan is 'a bedroom town', Bemrose tells us in a prologue, but it hasn't always been this way. The clue to its industrial past lies in the forest that fringes the town's poorer neighbourhood: a cluster of sumacs and scrub maple, it conceals wasteland with a cement floor, the last traces of a factory that 'by some scarcely imaginable act of violence... has been torn up and carried away'.</p> <p>To tell his story, Bemrose leads us back in time to the Fifties, where Margaret and Alf Walker are raising their three children on Alf's mill salary. The violence conjured up in the prologue does not dissipate, however, and menace hangs around every corner. Jamie, the youngest, falls in with a dark-eyed loner who fights and shoplifts; Joe, the bright eldest destined for university, accepts rides with speeding classmates; Alf himself becomes trapped in a feud between mill management and union officials.</p> <p>Bemrose lingers over domestic details, but this Hardian sense of doom is only reinforced by the sinister still lifes that he sketches so well. Set over scarcely more than a year, The Island Walkers is so momentously bound with its backdrop that its reach feels epic.</p>"
