  "Private Kevin McCarthy, 19, from Wallasey, near Liverpool, looked through the camouflaged netting at a fetid canal, dusty streets and rubbish-strewn wasteland. It was just after noon and the thermometer had hit 45 C. There was the crack of a rocket-propelled grenade some way away, but otherwise it was quiet - much to McCarthy's relief. <p>For almost all last month, McCarthy and 200 other men of B Company, First Battalion, The Cheshires, were under siege as their compound in the centre of the southern port city of Basra came under continuous attack. Rockets smashed through walls, mortar rounds thumped into hot sand. Elsewhere in Basra, four British soldiers died. A unit in Amarra, 200 miles north, suffered 30 per cent casualties. </p> <p>Power has been handed back to the Iraqis. Now it remains to be seen if the result is the failure or success of the British army's project to stabilise southern Iraq. </p> <p>According to The Cheshires' commanding officer, Lt-Col John Donnelly, the fighting in August was more intense than any during the war last year. 'We fired more rounds, killed more people and took more casualties,' he told The Observer. </p> <p>For soldiers like McCarthy, straight out of training, the worst thing was not being able to chase their attackers through the streets. 'It winds you up when your mates are being injured. You want to sort it out. But you can't.' </p> <p>The restrictions on the 8,000 British soldiers in the south reveal the odd nature of their struggle. The local authorities had requested restraint from the troops and, since the formal handover of power to the Iraqis on 28 June, the British have to listen. A letter from the provincial council was handed over asking the British to avoid turning their city into a battlefield. The officers have complied, with some misgivings. 'I hope to God this all works out,' said one . 'It'll be a tragedy for us all if it doesn't.' </p> <p>The primary task of the British troops - and the Italians, Dutch, Japanese, Lithuanians and Norwegians alongside them - is to guarantee security for 4.5 million people. In many areas Iraqis can go about their daily lives without fear, but the army flew The Observer the short distance between Basra airport and the city in a helicopter because the road is too dangerous. Intelligence officers spoke of a continuing threat from al-Qaeda-style militants, criminal racketeers and highly professional terrorists. The attacks by al-Mahdi ceased only when peace came to the shrine city of Najaf, 250 miles north. And, though there have been significant improvements in recent months, the critical oil infrastructure still needs hundreds of British troops to defend it. All this in a predominantly Shia area oppressed by Saddam. </p> <p>Alongside security is reconstruction. Working to doctrines developed over decades of counter-insurgency warfare, the army stresses 'consent building'. In stark contrast to their US counterparts, every British soldier remains 'on message', talking of 'winning hearts and minds'. </p> <p>'If there's a man on a corner with an RPG, I can shoot him and someone else will just take his place,' said Donnelly. 'Military force has to be part of a broad strategy.' </p> <p>A young corporal boasted that at least half his squad had basic Arabic. 'The Yanks will just start shooting. We know better,' he said. </p> <p>A major part of 'consent winning' is a series of aid programmes. Millions of pounds from British taxpayers have been pumped into 'rapid impact projects', such as one that has brought fresh drinking water to 9,000 people. </p> <p>The difficulties are immeasurable. Electricity provision in Basra has not kept up with soaring demand. Inadequate water supply has caused riots. Senior officers talk of a decade before the region's economy is 'up and running'. </p> <p>And little can disguise the fact that, however politically desirable, transferring power to locals has drawbacks. Most ministries are an administrative shambles, decades of dictatorship mean that few officials are used to taking decisions, skills are lacking and money is short. Meanwhile, the southern provinces resent Baghdad, corruption stymies the flow of government funds and many appointments made in haste by the occupation authorities last year were poor. </p> <p>Yet on the critical question of keeping the support of the populace, the British appear relatively successful. Driving through Az Zubayr, an industrial town south west of Basra, the scene of heavy fighting last year, soldiers are greeted with waves and thumbs-up. In July, a successful local council election was held with British assistance, though only 15 per cent of the population voted. Council chairman Shari Haseen al-Moussaoui waxes lyrical about democracy but says there is 'every problem imaginable'. In the market, people express their gratitude to the coalition for ridding them of Saddam before launching into a litany of complaints. </p> <p>Brigadier Andrew Kennett, who commands nearly 5,000 British troops, paraphrases Lawrence of Arabia: 'A less than perfect local solution is vastly preferably to any imposed solution. Of course that involves taking a risk, but that is what we do.'</p>",
  "The events of the past five days in Russia have brought an international response of solidarity with the people of Beslan, a blasted place of 35,000 souls whose emotions at this time can hardly be guessed at. The images of dead children in bodybags touch the very heart of what it means to be human and what it means when that humanity is so unforgivably taken away. <p>The massacre at School Number 1 immediately raises many complex questions. But before considering those, we should take time to pause and remember the lives of those killed and maimed by the terrorists and of the thousands of lives that will be indelibly touched by their dreadful actions. </p> <p>Yesterday, Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, said that he considered the event a declaration of 'full-scale war' against his nation. But depraved terrorism of this type does not come unannounced. Russian forces fighting the two wars in Chechnya have distinguished themselves with their own brand of brutality - killing, torturing, maiming and kidnapping with equal abandon and disregard for the rule of law. </p> <p>Putin's policy of a draconian crackdown and his failure to even countenance a limited degree of self-determination in some parts of the Caucasus has been a policy doomed to fail. He has become a recruiting sergeant for terrorists and an excuse for those with the darkest of motives to hitch a ride on the feelings of powerlessness among the people of the region. </p> <p>Putin represents Russia's instinctive reflexes towards Chechnya and the increasingly lawless and brutal society that Russia has become.Yesterday, he admitted that his nation had failed to keep up with a changing world and that its unreformed security services had been unable to dam the nation's porous borders. Terrorism flourishes in such circumstances. </p> <p>Russia is a country where journalists critical of the government are shot by gunmen who the authorities make no attempt to bring to justice, and where businessmen can be held in prison on trumped-up charges if they are suspected of supporting the opposition. The much criticised weakness of the Russian security forces in organising themselves to avoid a bloodbath in Beslan, significantly admitted as a failure by Putin, results, in part, from Russia's attempt to insulate itself from external criticism. </p> <p>The instinct of Western leaders like Tony Blair and George Bush is to stand with Putin, and portray Chechnya as part of the seamless war on terrorism. It is true there are points of intersection. Chechnya informs the anger of many of the jihadist groups. Saudi money, too, has financed Chechen fighters. Some radicals see Chechnya as the new Afghanistan. But there are critical differences. </p> <p>The troubles of Chechnya predate 11 September. The ongoing deadlock, together with Putin's prosecution of the continuing war, contributes to, rather than results from, the global terror crisis. That is why any resolution needs to be internationalised, involving not just Russia and Chechnya, but possibly also the Organisation Security and Co-operation in Europe. Until now, Moscow has resisted any such suggestion and yesterday Putin was understandably talking tough. But the decision by local leaders to talk to Aslan Maskhadov's separatists to try and negotiate an end to the Beslan crisis, apparently approved by the Kremlin, suggests there is room for talks that Russia has to date ruled out. </p> <p>The thugs around the Chechen terrorist leader, Shamil Basayev, need to be isolated; the money trail needs to be out in the open and the Saudis confronted with their responsibility. The Russians need to concede that, without a willingness to negotiate, the crisis will deepen. And Europe has to help foster change. More of the same will mean more Beslans - more traumas for Russia and further horrors for the rest of the world.</p>",
  "Friday afternoon, and the kids are coming out of school. They emerge in ones or twos, shyly, because they are new and don't yet know each other, spot their parents and smile. My Lily is one of them, and we hold hands on the way home. <p>Friday afternoon and the kids are coming out of school. They run terrified, half naked, bloodied, towards freedom. They leave behind the bodies of hundreds of their class-mates blown up by home-made explosives or shot down as they fled by gunmen on the school roof. I cannot bear to imagine what the parents of the dead children feel. I won't even try. </p> <p>Fortunately the Beslan parents will not have seen the Friday evening news on the BBC sum up the day's events by describing them as a 'great embarrassment for President Putin.' Don't we all know that governments can stop this kind of thing either by arranging political settlements so that hostage-taking is unnecessary, or through sufficient military preparation? All terribly 'embarrassing'. </p> <p>Certainly Russia has had a hard time recently. A week ago two planes were blown-up by suicide bombers. 90 men, women and children obliterated in mid-air. On Tuesday evening eight people were killed in a suicide bombing outside a Moscow metro station. A number of children - who the bomber presumably saw before she pressed the 'on' switch - were among the injured. Last summer two women suicide bombers blew themselves up at an open-air rock festival near, killing 17 people, mostly teenagers. </p> <p>In the face of this ruthless exploitation of the softest of soft targets, do we (do the Russians) talk, shoot or give in? Which do we do in Iraq, when faced with hostage-taking by what are usually now called 'insurgents'? </p> <p>Sometimes you aren't given the option, of course. Last week 12 Nepalese workers for a Jordanian construction company were killed by an organisation calling itself the Ansar al-Sunna Army. On video one was beheaded ('The blindfolded man moaned and a shrill wheeze was heard. The masked man then displayed the head to the camera before resting it on the decapitated body.') and the other 11 were shot ('Blood seeped from their bodies onto the sand'). The accompanying statement read, 'The ruling of God was implemented on 12 Nepalese who came to Iraq to fight against Muslims and to serve the Jews and Christians. They are from the Buddhist faith.' Nepal has no troops in Iraq. </p> <p>In the same week al-Jazeera, which has allowed itself to be co-opted as the publicity arm of such organisations, aired a clip from a Zarqawi video showing three Turkish lorry drivers seated in front of some gunmen. Later the men were found dead near Samarra. Turkey has no troops in Iraq. </p> <p>There were demands, however, made in the case of Enzo Baldoni, the Italian journalist and Red Cross worker, kidnapped and his driver killed by a group called the Islamic Army in Iraq. When the Italian government refused to withdraw its troops from Iraq, Baldoni was murdered. </p> <p>The same group has been holding the two French journalists, Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot, whose appeals to the French government to repeal the school hijab ban were broadcast on al-Jazeera. The French have naturally refused to comply with the repeal demand, but they did something else instead. Communications Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres appealed to the kidnappers, arguing that, 'We do not understand why journalists (were taken hostage ... when our country, in terms of Iraq, expressed with immense force in the United Nations the necessity of respecting international law to restore peace.' </p> <p>I sympathise entirely with the desire to free these two men from the threat of death, but isn't de Vabres's position essentially that he quite understands why these groups kill Italians, murder some miserable Nepalese and execute a few Turks, but that it just isn't fair to do it to the French? </p> <p>So the Islamic Action Front of Jordan (currently attempting to prevent proper penalties against so-called 'honour killers' in that country) says that the journalists' lives should be spared 'Because of France's distinguished position in rejecting the Anglo-American occupation of Iraq.' Not because you shouldn't murder journalists. A Hamas spokesman in Gaza agreed, arguing that freeing the Frenchmen would increase the isolation of Israel and the US. Not because you shouldn't kill journalists. The French argument, regrettably, amounts to the same thing. </p> <p>Or, to put it another way, if you leave well alone you should be able to avoid being terrorised. Yesterday, in the wake of the Beslan school horror, the historian Corelli Barnett more or less blamed the crisis on the war against terror itself. His thesis was that, since September 11th, the actions of the West (and particularly the Americans) had made things far, far worse. </p> <p>The problem with this is the simple one that the war with terror was declared by terror itself. Declared in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi in 1998, declared in New York on 11 September. It wasn't until 11 September, however, that we began to appreciate the scale of what was already happening. The idea that, had we negotiated with the Taliban, left Saddam in place and put more pressure on Sharon to settle, kids would now be safe in North Ossetia, is just wishful thinking. </p> <p>In Saturday's Guardian Isabel Hilton gave a more interesting explanation. This is an era, she pointed out, of asymmetric warfare in which - regrettably - outgunned insurgents eventually come after kids, journalists and Nepalese cooks. What else (she implied) are they going to do? But wasn't Gandhi's situation asymmetric? Did he take over schools and kill the kids? Did Mandela? Is it really the case that what we have here are outgunned liberation movements? </p> <p>On Thursday night Channel Four showed the drama The Hamburg Cell, which attempted to get inside the minds of the young al-Qaeda operatives who carried out the 11 September hijackings. What the film showed was a classic cult in operation, with young men - pampered and envious, frustrated and egotistic - urging each other on to more and more pitiless acts of violence. The film not only explained the Twin Towers, it inadvertently explained Jonestown and the mass suicide in the Guyanese jungle. </p> <p>It was also interesting to see how they provided intellectual justification for their actions. Everything was read in one direction: how Muslims were forced to suffer. So, for example, the West's inaction in Bosnia was thrown into the balance, but not its intervention on the side of the Muslims of Kosovo. </p> <p>I finished watching The Hamburg Cell to find an email waiting. It was from a named professional in a British provincial city. He was complaining about a couple of anti-Muslim articles by men called Browne and Cummins, run in The Times and the Sunday Telegraph. Part of it read, 'I presume you are also a Jew because it is Jews who have lost their marbles and shoot themselves in both feet and legs.... You can't escape the conclusion that most of the commentators are Jewish and their primary aim is to get the Christians to beat the hell out of Islam and Muslims. But do not be expecting me to shed tears as the same bullies would turn on Jews again and may be there would be a final holocaust against them, invited by themselves.' </p> <p>Where do I even begin? By pointing out that Browne and Cummins are not, on the face of it, Jewish names? How do I mollify a man whose every sentence is so flawed, yet so certain? Let alone a man who believes that God has instructed him to kill Nepalese cooks, or will absolve him if he shoots a fleeing child in the back? </p> <p>I am not saying that the only answer is in security. In the case of Chechnya I take the argument of those who point out that, until five years ago and Moscow's reoccupation of the province, there was no significant terrorism there. It seems to me that an absolutely necessary part of the battle for a safer world consists of cutting away as much as you can of the potential support for terrorists. </p> <p>The logic of this is not, however, to concede to terrorists. Much of what they want we can never give them, and much of what they want lies in the act of terrorism itself. And it as false a trope to say that there are usually political solutions to terrorism as to say that there are always military ones.</p>",
  "<p>As someone says in David Hare's play, Stuff Happens, war should be the politics of last resort. In Iraq, the neocons jumped the gun. The rush to battle may have been outpaced, though, by the speed of the stage transfer. War is now the theatre of first resort and George W Bush is filling houses everywhere. </p> <p>In New York, a Bush-based oeuvre sprawls through Broadway. In London, Tim Robbins's antiwar satire, Embedded, a queasy hybrid of Journey's End and Spitting Image, has just gone into preview. So, at the National Theatre, has Hare's state-of-the-nation epic, greeted, like every new Hare play, with the awe that once presaged a royal birth. </p> <p>Political theatre is back, the pundits keep saying, but what's new? Ever since the ancient Greeks turned foreign policy into myth, engaging with the public world has been good box office. Arden and Wesker chronicled working-class emancipation. Caryl Churchill echoed feminist dreams. And now, at a time when politics and plays are, individually, the dullest shows in town, a mixture can have magical results. </p> <p>Some hits, such as Michael Frayn's Democracy, a study of espionage in the time of Willy Brandt, are specifically political. Others plug the gaps of what governments should be saying. Alan Bennett's The History Boys explores, in a way that ministers do not, what education is for. It also points to other possibilities. </p> <p>At this rate, the new Mary Poppins may be a lesson in Ofsted-outlawed daycare. Singin' in the Rain might nod at climate change. The Almeida Theatre's forthcoming musical version of Brighton Rock could serve up Graham Greene's story of Thirties seaside gangs as a parable of antisocial behaviour in pre-asbo times. You cannot, on current trends, have too much politics in theatre and you certainly cannot, in his admirers' eyes, have too much David Hare. </p> <p>His immense trilogy, an audit of the nation in 1993, explored God, justice and power politics. Perhaps helped along by Bush, who views himself as a trinity of the separate elements, Hare has settled for a single, three-hour treatment of the Iraq war. Professional critics have yet to judge, but they are often kind to political plays. Sometimes too kind. Guantanamo, which has just transferred to New York, is unimpeachable but almost unwatchable. Yet nearly every pundit, from across the political spectrum, loved it. As Michael Coveney, a rare dissenter, has argued, protest is part of the mainstream now. </p> <p>Hare's preview audience, mostly middle-aged, looks familiar. I have seen these people before, steering posters reading 'Make Tea, Not War'. They marched against Blair and now they have come to see him felled. In comfort, though. </p> <p>Anyone who has sat through the spartan Edinburgh Fringe, or recently bought a \u00a340 ticket to a West End show, will be struck by the cheap luxury state-subsidised theatre offers to the grandee playwrights who deplore New Labour and to modern tricoteuses who want to see their leaders flayed. Good manners would stop this audience from tearing Donald Rumsfeld to shreds, if he were to walk into the Olivier Theatre, but no one would be offering him a Malteser either. Journalists aside, I doubt if there is a warmonger in the house. </p> <p>I loathed the Iraq war, but I don't like seeing my anger bounced back at me from stage or screen. I cannot bear the preening Michael Moore or tedious plays served up as balm to protesters. Still, Hare and Nicholas Hytner, the National's director, are never going to do Chomsky with choc ices. Though Hytner has tackled Iraq before, and better, in a Henry V that slipped from simplistic patriotism to the savagery of the battlefield, he and Hare are brilliant enough. </p> <p>The cast is stunning and the soundbites funny. Men in suits marching on and off a stark stage suggest the staff of the Alliance and Leicester on a fire drill, but that is standard for theatre of record. The stasis lies not in the staging of this inventory of history, sanitised as it is, but in its antiquity. Stuff Happened. This is yesterday's story, unstained by blood spilled from Baghdad to Beslan. </p> <p>If Hare's narrative lacks ordinary people, it is also short of a hero. Colin Powell has to plug the gap, even though Bob Woodward, in Plan of Attack, painted him more convincingly as an unhappy compromiser, lacking a hawk's ideology but still content to wave a phoney phial of anthrax as war bait. </p> <p>Then there is the Prime Minister. Hare's Blair is not a moral zealot convinced of his own rightness, but a man racked with doubt. That treatment should surprise no one, for Hare is an improbable iconoclast. He admires Blair greatly, or at least he did. On the only occasion I met him, he was scathing about the 'dead heads' of the cabinet and baffled that Blair could surround himself with such dim lieutenants. Why, he wondered, should someone 'of that intelligence' not want more interesting people around him? </p> <p>Hare did not see, either, how people could argue for a social democratic government and not be implicated in its failure. 'I find this astonishingly easy hatred [of Blair and Brown] irresponsible,' he said. This was before Iraq, but I do not imagine that Hare lightly sheds allegiances. </p> <p>However much he hated the war, he is generous to Blair, so subtly that prowar critics hardly realise why they like the play much better than they expected. </p> <p>Nor do those of us who believe that the Prime Minister behaved unforgivably over Iraq realise at first why we feel short-changed by a litany of war cleansed of death and misery. Hare's analysis, careful, detailed and tidily-arranged, has all the passion of Exchange &amp; Mar t. And yet it is far more than that. There is a message in any good political theatre and Hare's, for all its drawbacks, is among the best. His Powell may be absurdly deified, his Blair too pure, but his Bush character should chill an anti-war, pro-Democrat audience. </p> <p>Hare is a cautious polemicist who realised, way before other satirists and commentators, that Bush is not a parody of a President. His version, more patrician and smarter than the real thing, offers a notion of how the President might look to Republicans streaming home from Madison Square Gardens with their 'Kiss Me!' badges and bottles of 'W' ketchup, for those not wishing to taint their fries with the Heinz brand that enriched John Kerry. </p> <p>Hare's Bush, neither a fool nor a monster, is just a decent, down-home guy with a Bible-bashing, Texan naivety that sidesteps caricature and flatters truth. </p> <p>Perhaps that is the cleverness of David Hare. His catalogue of the past may, after all, point to what comes next. Preview audiences, longing to see a savage judgment, are, instead, watching something that they have not yet dared acknowledge. Far from demolishing George W Bush, Hare is explaining, probably inadvertently, why the blundering overlord of an illegal war is 11 points clear in the polls and within snatching distance of another term in office. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@observer.co.uk\">mary.riddell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Tiffany Watkins stood in front of a projection screen and went through her presentation to the convention delegates. Neither Watkins, nor the audience gathered in the plush New York hotel, were typical Republicans. They were all black. Nevertheless, Watkins, an operative from campaign HQ, urged them to get out the vote for President George W. Bush. 'We are not taking anything for granted,' Watkins warned. <p>Watkins does the bidding of Karl Rove, Bush's trusted campaign strategist, who has masterminded his campaigns since he first ran for the governorship of Texas. Rove's plan is simple: a mass mobilisation of the Republican base, coupled with a brutal media operation that has gone after Democratic nominee John Kerry's Vietnam record, seeking to portray the decorated veteran as a weak-willed liar. </p> <p>Last week, the plan went like clockwork. The New York convention saw a series of brutal attacks on Kerry, lavish praise for Bush and dire warnings about the war on terror. The message was simple: America cannot risk electing Kerry. Bush was painted as a war leader; Kerry ridiculed as an untrustworthy flipflopper. </p> <p>There has been a fundamental shift in the presidential race. Bush's offensive has left Kerry's campaign floundering. Last week, he shook up his top staff, bringing in Clinton era experts. He also went negative, too, lambasting Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney for dodging Vietnam. For Democrats that means Kerry, at last, has come out swinging. </p> <p>But Republican strategists hope it may already be too late. After months of trailing, Bush has now moved decisively ahead in the polls. A Time poll had him with a huge 11-point lead. Another had him four points up. </p> <p>But Rove is leaving nothing to chance. At a meeting last week of delegates from Ohio, perhaps the most important swing state in the race, Rove exhorted party members to greater efforts. 'Do more than you've ever done before,' he said 'We need to ask everyone we know to get involved in this crusade.' </p> <p>Rove is credited with creating the Republicans' awesome machine. It is a huge pyramid, with Rove at its apex, feeding down in disciplined layer on layer into every county in every state in America. It has databases of tens of millions of voters, has signed up one million volunteers, has put field organisations in key states long before Democratic rivals and has poured millions of dollars into voter registration drives. Rove has learnt the lessons of 2000, when five states were decided by less than half a percentage point. </p> <p>The media operation is equally sophisticated. Kerry's Vietnam record was meant to make the Democrats immune on national security. But Rove has a record of attacking opponents' strengths, not weaknesses. Kerry has faced a full-frontal assault by Republican leaders and shadowy surrogate groups, such as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Kerry, a triple Purple Heart winner, has been left desperately fighting allegations that he betrayed fellow veterans by turning against the war. </p> <p>Given that Bush himself dodged Vietnam when family connections got him a place in the National Guard, it was a stunning turnaround that Kerry's support among veterans proceeded to plummet. </p> <p>The war on terror is key to Republican success. It is ever-present on the campaign trail and in television adverts. It was the main selling-point of the convention. </p> <p>New York was a media triumph for the Republicans. Leaders of the Bush campaign have carefully distanced themselves from their dirty tricks squadrons. Instead, they relentlessly focused on the war on terror. Speaker after speaker, from former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani to Bush himself, recalled in starkly personal terms they way they had dealt with the terrorist attacks of 11 September. The war in Iraq was artfully moulded into the war on terror. The message was simple: trust Bush to protect America from terrorist attacks. They have sought to make the election more about electing a commander-in-chief than a president. </p> <p>The most devastating attack came from Zell Miller, a Democrat senator who has effectively defected to the Republicans. Miller laid into Kerry as not strong enough for the job. It was crude theatre. Miller listed defence cuts that he said Kerry had supported and then added: 'The man now wants to be the commander-in-chief of U.S. armed forces? U.S. forces armed with what? Spitballs?' </p> <p>Many pundits decried Miller's speech as over the top. But a survey of a focus group of swing voters in Ohio said they found the speech convincing. Miller's diatribe had hit home. </p> <p>From a distance, at the start of last week, Kerry looked as if he didn't have a care in the world. Resting at his holiday home in Nantucket, he donned a wetsuit for a spot of windsurfing. A day later, he and his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, took their motorboat out for a spin. They smiled and laughed as Kerry steered through the choppy waters. </p> <p>But behind the scenes, the atmosphere was feverish. After a dreadful few weeks, the Kerry campaign has been gripped by rumours of a shake-up. Last week, Kerry and his campaign manager, Mary Beth Cahill, finally swooped. In came high-profile names from the Clinton era. Joe Lockhart, a former White House spokesman, will now join Kerry on his travels. Former Clinton adviser Joel Johnson will head a 'war room' to toughen up attacks. </p> <p>Change was needed. Democrats were wrong-footed at their Boston convention. They stressed the importance of not 'Bush-bashing', only to be blown away by Republican attacks throughout late August. Kerry is also said to be furious at the lacklustre response to allegations about his Vietnam record. It put his campaign on the back foot, forcing them to fight on an issue (national security) they thought they had dealt with and keeping the election away from their core strengths, such as jobs and healthcare. 'They are allowing the Republicans to define the issues. You can't win an election that way,' said Ken Warren, a political scientist the University of St Louis. </p> <p>But, Kerry's supporters say, there are two months to go. They insist, despite the last few polls, that the race is still on a knife-edge. They are probably right. There has already been a dramatic shift in gear. Last Friday, Democrats began a $45 million advertising campaign in 20 states, spending more than half of their remaining funds. Kerry also held a midnight rally after Bush's speech that forced him on to the television networks. He used the opportunity to accuse Bush and Cheney of skipping their Vietnam service. 'I'm not going to have my commitment to defend this country questioned by those who refused to serve when they could have,' he said. </p> <p>That could be a fruitful line of attack. Already Bush's hell-raising youth and National Guard service are moving back onto the agenda. Ben Barnes, a Texas politician who says he secured Bush's place in the Air National Guard, is expected to give a TV interview as early as this week. 'I'll have something to say about that,' he told The Observer. </p> <p>A video of Barnes is already circulating on the internet. It was shot several months ago, at a pro-Kerry rally in Austin, Texas. In it, the former lieutenant-governor of the state is blunt. 'I got a young man named George W. Bush into the National Guard,' he says. He then describes how he was spurred to speak out after visiting a Vietnam memorial and feeling guilt at all the sons of the rich and powerful whom he had helped avoid being sent overseas. 'I became more ashamed of myself than I had ever been,' he said. </p> <p>Suddenly America's already bitter, dirty and divisive election has just slipped even further downhill. It is possible that Rove may regret the direction in which the campaign is going. Probably not. One of his first political experiences on a national level was in 1973, when he was accused of holding seminars for college Republicans on dirty tricks techniques. </p> <p>So much is now at stake. Away from Iraq and the war on terror, many Democrats are deeply afraid of the domestic agenda of a Bush second term. Bush has vowed to move on abortion rights, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and make his tax cuts permanent. </p> <p>Social and religious conservatives are now firmly in control of the Republican Party. In New York, reporters were banned from a rally of Christian conservatives at the Waldorf-Astoria. Inside speakers debated fighting abortion and trying to remove the separation between church and state in American life. </p> <p>For Democrats, that meeting was a stark example of the importance of this election. Many Republicans, who regard themselves in a 'culture war' with a liberal elite, probably felt the same. But as Republicans left New York last week, they were confident that their side is winning. </p> <p>For the moment, Rove's plan is on track. Meanwhile, Bob Shrum, Kerry's own powerful political mentor, must try to win back the initiative. Republicans take heart from Rove's record. Since teaming up with Bush, Rove has powered Bush to the White House. Shrum, however, who has worked for four different Democratic presidential candidates, has lost each time.</p>",
  "As the death toll in the siege of Beslan's School Number One climbed to 330 - 156 of them children - President Vladimir Putin warned yesterday that terrorists had declared 'a full-scale war' on Russia. Officials said all 35 hostage-takers were also dead as doctors struggled to cope with more than 600 injured children and adults. <p>In a grim televised address Putin pledged an unremitting crackdown on terrorists and their sympathisers; but said his country's security forces had to bear responsibility for allowing the kidnappers to launch their devastating attack. </p> <p>Putin said he would attack terrorism across the North Caucasus and called on Russia's security forces to fight more effectively against the threat. He said that following the collapse of the Soviet Union the nation had been weakened and unable to respond as effectively as it must. </p> <p>In an aside aimed at the widespread outrage in Russia at the bungled and apparently unplanned assault to free the hostages, which may have contributed to the large number of deaths, Putin said: 'It is vital to create an effective crisis management system, including fundamentally new approaches in the activity of the security forces. </p> <p>'In general, we need to admit that we did not show an understanding of the complexities and dangers of the processes occurring in our own country and in the world. In any case, we could not adequately react ... We showed weakness, and weak people are beaten.' </p> <p>He noted that Russia's borders had become porous and 'unprotected' and that corruption had pervaded the law enforcement agencies. </p> <p>Putin also called for a mobilisation of the nation before what he called the 'common danger' of terrorism. He said measures would be taken to strengthen Russia's territorial integrity, create a more effective crisis management system and overhaul the law enforcement structures. </p> <p>'We stopped giving enough attention to questions of defence and security, and allowed corruption to infect our judicial and law enforcement sphere,' he said. </p> <p>'Moreover, our country - which used to have the strongest defence system of its external borders - became unprotected from either the west or the east' he added. </p> <p>Putin said some enemies wanted to tear off parts of Russia, and others were helping them. 'They help, supposing that Russia, as one of the greatest nuclear powers, still poses a threat to them, so they have to get rid of that threat.' </p> <p>His comments came after he made a lightning pre-dawn visit to Beslan, where he said he had ordered the region's administrative borders to be closed while authorities searched for the attackers' accomplices. Later he decreed that Russia would observe two days of mourning on Monday and Tuesday. 'I ask you to remember those who died at the hands of terrorists in recent days,' he said in his address. </p> <p>He looked and sounded as grim as the events warranted and by blaming the security forces for a lack of professionalism, he voiced an opinion many Russians share. He also appealed to middle-aged and older Russians by talking sympathetically of the collapse of the Soviet Union as something that had undermined people's security. His stern and serious broadcast last night will have satisfied many Russians, at least in its tone and some of its content. </p> <p>Eyewitness accounts from inside the gym, where most of the 1,000 or so hostages were held, appear to contradict earlier claims by Russian authorities that nine or 10 Arab fighters were among the terrorists. Instead, survivors said most spoke with Ingush, Chechen or Russian accents, largely communicating in Russian. </p> <p>Only one of them was described as having darker skin that could have marked him out as a foreign fighter. The behaviour of the terrorists towards the hostages as explosions ripped through the gym, triggering the Russian assault, also appears complex, with some witnesses describing how fleeing gunmen shot hostages, while others said one gunmen, called 'Hassan', helped hostages as the fire caught hold. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the international community continued to express its horror and sympathy over the outcome. </p> <p>At the Vatican, the Pope condemned the attack as a 'vile and ruthless aggression on defenceless children and families', and offered his 'heartfelt affection to the Russian people in this hour of dismay and anguish'. </p> <p>The Archbishop of Canterbury revealed that even his faith had been tested by the depth of the horror. 'It is probably the suffering of children that most deeply challenges anybody's personal faith,' he told Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>'When you see the depth of energy that people can put into such evil, then of course, yes, there is a flicker, there is a doubt. It would be inhumane, I think, not to react that way.' </p> <p>He quoted the Bible in which Jesus said it would be better for people who committed offences against children to have millstones put around their necks and cast in the sea. He noted the Koran said God did not love those who overstepped the limits. 'They were performing deeply evil acts, perhaps the most evil kind that we can imagine.'</p>",
  "When there is a bombing, Russians are no longer surprised to discover a girl is responsible. <p>From Aset to Zulikhan, exotic Chechen women's names are familiar from the Dubrovka theatre siege in 2002 and the rock concert suicide bombs at Tushino last summer.Within minutes of news breaking of the Beslan siege last week, it was apparent that women were among the terrorists. </p> <p>Two Chechen women loaded with explosives were on the planes that crashed in southern Russia 11 days ago. A week later a woman suicide bomber killed 10 people at a Moscow metro station. </p> <p>Almost all of the more than 12 attacks on Russia in the past year have involved women - 'black widows', avenging the deaths of family members in Russia's conflict in Chechnya. The survivors of the three-day Dubrovka theatre siege in October 2002, where 18 of the 50 terrorists were women, are among those who have suffered at the hands of the black widows. </p> <p>One of the hostages, Irina Filipova, 29, a Moscow teacher, still has mixed feelings about her captors. Some seemed willing participants. Others were teenagers who seemed too young to hold any opinions at all. Most told horrific stories of their lives in Chechnya. </p> <p>Filipova said: 'They didn't talk politics. They said things which anyone could understand. They would say, \"My whole family was killed. I have buried all my children. I live in the forest. I have nowhere to go and nothing to live for\". </p> <p>'Some cried. One of them told me her parents had sold her into it [terrorism] and she didn't want to blow herself up.' </p> <p>She found the existence of women terrorists chilling. 'Men and war is one thing. But if there are women ... I realised that we might not get out alive. Most of the women were wearing black chador headscarves so I realised they must be extremists and it would be impossible to reason with them. Some of them even changed in the hall into their chadors in front of us. Before, they had been in disguise in the theatre, wearing sweaters and jeans. The women were left to guard us, with pistols and hand grenades while the men assembled the bombs.' </p> <p>They had fixed tactics. The women and men had different roles: the men took care of the explosives and intimida tion, while the women distributed medical supplies, blankets, water, chewing gum and chocolate (unlike in the Beslan siege where all outside supplies were refused). Sometimes, though, the women toyed threateningly with their two-kilo bomb belts. </p> <p>Like many of the survivors of Dubrovka, Filipova's recollections are confused. She still wonders if the women were there through revenge against Russian atrocities or because they had been sold into suicidal slavery by Chechen warlords. </p> <p>This confusion has allowed one theory about the black widows to prevail in the Russian psyche. Until now many have had some sympathy for them. Svetlana Makunina, 27, a journalist at Moscow's tabloid newspaper Zhizn , echoes the common Russian view: 'It is all zombirovaniye ' - an expression meaning 'turned into zombies'. </p> <p>'The women don't want to be involved in these attacks. They are drugged, raped, forced to do it. I understand they are not to blame, but with Beslan it has gone too far - to involve children in this is just beyond the pale. What was the reason behind the attacks on the school? We don't know, they haven't given a reason. The same way they didn't give a reason for 11 September,' said Makunina. </p> <p>'The fact that Kofi Annan gave a statement supporting Russia and we have the United Nations on our side shows that this is about the war on terrorism, not about Russia's politics.' </p> <p>But Beslan will change everything. Zombirovaniye allows the belief that the women have not been brutalised by Russians but by their own people, fanatics linked to Al Qaeda. It puts the blame on Chechnya, not Russia. The women are brainwashed by rebel groups who use drugs and blackmail techniques such as showing videotaped rapes to the women's families. </p> <p>This ignores the stories about Russian soldiers laughing as they charge Chechen fathers 300 roubles (nearly \u00a310) not to rape their daughters. </p> <p>Nastya Kruglikova, 21, a student at Moscow's Institute of Foreign Languages, survived the Moscow theatre siege with her mother and aunt. Her 15-year-old cousin was killed. She was instinctively unsympathetic to the terrorists until she realised what the women must have gone through. </p> <p>She said: 'There was a grenade laid by a woman between my cousin and my aunt. I asked, \"what is going to happen, are you going to blow us up?\" And she said, \"no, it will be OK. And then she seemed to change her mind and said, \"Well, maybe you will be blown up but at least you won't know anything about it. You won't regret it. You don't know what's happening in Chechnya. You can't know what your soldiers have done there to our people. You can't have any idea how terrible our lives are\". She said she had a child she had left behind, that God would look after him. Some of them started crying. They looked around 16.' </p> <p>Among the terrorists was Zura Barayeva, widow of Chechen warlord Arbi Barayev. Filipova said: 'She seemed very normal. She hid her feelings behind a mask of courtesy. She seemed to take pleasure that she was in this situation, that people were listening to her and wanting to talk to her, that she was in control. She would ask people if they had children. She would always say, \"Everything will be fine. It will finish peacefully\". She took off her bomb belt and carried it over her shoulder, all very relaxed.' </p> <p>Nastya Kruglikova remembers another older woman: 'Her name was Asya. She told us about her life in Chechnya. She was the only one I wasn't afraid of. She hoped they would give up, that there would be a conversation with the government and it would end well. She said, \"please don't worry\". She tried not to frighten us.' </p> <p>Filipova also felt a strange sympathy: 'I hated them too, although they let children out of the theatre, they didn't let teenagers and sick out. But if someone tells you these terrible things ... of course you understand their motivation. To hate them and think them evil ... I just couldn't.' </p> <p>But after Beslan who will be able to say the same? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Viv Groskop is a writer and expert on Soviet affairs</p>",
  "<p><strong> Dizzee Raxcal <br> Showtime</strong> <br>(XL) <br> It's been an eventful few years for Dylan Mills, the east London grime scene's most prominent exponent. From being expelled by three schools before finally hitting upon a sympathetic soul in the shape of music teacher Tim Smith at Langdon Park, who recognised his potential and encouraged him to learn the music programme Cubase on the computers at the back of his classroom, was one step. From there to self-producing his debut album Boy in da Corner and taking it on to win the Mercury Music Prize and sell more than 250,000 copies was quite another. Since then the pace has hotted up further with a series of highly successful gigs and festival appearances on both sides of the Atlantic and, less than a year after his Mercury triumph, a follow-up album. Boy in da Corner was impressively raw, an assault on the ears. Almost completely devoid of bass or kick drums, the music was an amalgam of complex hat, shaker and snare patterns and weird, nasty synth noises, plastic strings and odd, James Bond-oriental motifs. The pace barely relented (save in the slower hit single 'Fix Up, Look Sharp' which samples a big slow kick and bluesy chorus from Billy Squires's 'The Big Beat') as the Bow boy's often machine-gun-rapid rattle told tales of disenchantment, alienation and underage pregnancy. There was an air of confused confrontation there, too; he would observe that guns were being used one minute, then threaten to leave holes in your face the next, and all with a strange cockney charm (the chorus of 'Jus' a Rascal' for starters). </p> <p>So some things stay the same up the old East End, then. Or do they? Has Dizzee Rascal moved on since his shattering debut? The answer is a qualified yes. Let's start with the music. For one thing, he has discovered bass and proper kick drums; he's also toned down the bully-boy hats, a fact which becomes clear on the mission statement of the opening title track. There are fuller arrangements throughout, a greater sense of musical sophistication, and better beats. </p> <p>The single 'Stand Up Tall' has almost funky house programming, and I like the way the bass noise almost doubles the vocals in the verses then cuts out for the chorus, a trick Dizzee works again with a fast kick in 'Everywhere'. It is in the latter that it first becomes clear that he doesn't mind letting the music play itself out this time around, rather than cutting it short as eccentric sub-bass and a muted clap spar with bell and gong noises to pleasing effect and a logically programmed close. He varies the pace too: 'Graftin' is essentially dub reggae. </p> <p>The spooky synth lines are still there - 'Knock Knock' confronts you with siren noises, scary strings and really queasy synth lines which bend up and down as Dizzee declares that he is 'here to annoy' - but they're sweeter, evidently made on more expensive kit; 'Imagine' turns into a really nice workout as three soft phrases merge towards its close. And the ersatz oriental now sits alongside other stuff. There's a full sung chorus from Vanya on 'Get By'; 'Learn' uses a composite of interesting Turkish-sounding string and woodwind samples as its foundation; and 'Dream' is based around Captain Sensible's version of 'Happy Talk' to hilarious - and hideous - effect. </p> <p>This latter is not the only indication that success has thrown up some new perspectives for Dizzee Rascal. Here he delivers a message of hope to the kids in Hackney; elsewhere his trips abroad have taught him that, 'There's a ghetto in every town / And the skies are all empty 'cause the stars are underground.' On the one hand Dizzee Rascal is still half-fixing for a fight ('I'll leave you lying in a ditch'); on the other there's a definite sense of humour at play on the album - as when the girls dissing his clothes as they watch him on telly at the close of 'Face' give way to him declaring through gritted teeth on 'Respect Me' that, 'People are gonna respect me if it kills you.' No, really, it is funny - and if this album delivers less of the shocking bleakness of the first, it gives out a good deal more charm.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Mediterranean: Between Reality and Utopia</strong> Photographers' Gallery London WC2 until 3 October </p> <p>Classical geographers thought of the Mediterranean as the Earth's centre. For them it was the buoyant source of life, and also the wine-dark, nurturing basis of culture. Its position on their maps of a small, autonomous world made it uterine; the same sea nowadays - befouled, congested, embattled, criss-crossed by a flotilla of drug-smugglers and people-traffickers - is Earth's lax sphincter. </p> <p>Deities once dwelt in it, and Aphrodite was born from its spermatic foam. Contemporary trippers, who use the sea as an alibi for a fortnight of binges and orgies on Majorca or Rhodes, are more likely to limp home with a sterilising dose of chlamydia. </p> <p>The Photographer's Gallery, in its group exhibition Mediterranean: Between Reality and Utopia, makes photography itself take some of the blame for the Mediterranean's lapse from grace. The sea is a victim of its popularity and publicity; it has been photographed to death, as Christophe Bourguedieu suggests by rephotographing a rack of tacky postcards from Tangier. Innumerable amateurish snappers have reduced it to a fuzzy background, a view that the camera looks at for them. </p> <p>Somehow all those happy holidaymakers who have adopted stiff, self-conscious poses on the coast seem to linger invisibly, using up the air and dirtying the water. Eric Kessels prides himself on having discovered, in a Barcelona market, a suitcase of anonymous holiday snaps that show the same woman preening on a succession of Mediterranean beaches every summer from 1956 to 1969. His find sadly implies a death, or at least the end of an affair. But I'm not sure that this elegiac motive makes the photographs worth exhibiting. No one else can see that ordinary woman with the enraptured gaze of her lover, and the camera, unable to capture emotion, reduces the relationship to banality. Shouldn't Kessels have decanted the trite little archive into the Mediterranean? No, that would only have added to its pollution. </p> <p>Jacques-Henri Lartigue signed his images of socialities disporting themselves on an unspoilt Riviera in the 1920s; beside his name in the margin he drew a blazing sun. Photography writes with light, so its practitioners are sun-worshippers; Lartigue's signature joyously privatised the burning, fertile star. Since then, the sun, as Pope says of his promiscuous heroine in 'The Rape of the Lock', has extended its franchise to 'shine on all alike'. </p> <p>St Tropez, photographed recently by the painter Eric Fischl, is a scrum of sweating bodies with sand in their crevices. Nature has been colonised by commerce, and shops line the sand. Xavier Ribas intrepidly researches the wooded lay-bys where Spanish hookers sell alfresco sex. Broken bottles splinter underfoot, and sticky tissues - souvenirs, like photographs, of holiday romance - flap from the bushes. </p> <p>At best, the Mediterranean now resembles a film set after the end of shooting. The exhibition includes G\u00fcnther F\u00f6rg's tour of the cliff-top villa in Capri where Godard filmed Le M\u00e9pris in 1963. In the film, Fritz Lang choreographed the Trojan war on a blazing roof terrace, while Brigitte Bardot, impersonating a modern goddess of love, seethed, writhed and pouted. The classical warriors and the cinematic idols have fled, and F\u00f6rg photographs vacant windows that stare unseeingly at the flat, empty water. </p> <p>Marc R\u00e4der presents a gruesomely glossy panorama of urbanisation on Majorca: a toytown of huddled villas, each equipped with a satellite dish so that the occupants can hide from the oppressive daylight and keep abreast of Big Brother . Two photographs of the same spot, taken more than a century apart, sum up the loss of paradise. Le Moine in southern France, photographed by Edouard-Denis Baldus in 1855, is a working valley that turns its back on the pebbly beach; a field where crops are cultivated has been squeezed into the crevasse. In Julie Ganzin's contemporary version, the peasants and their tilled earth have disappeared, and tourists prostrate themselves like broiling cadavers on a meagre slice of sand. A head sculpted from porous, eroded stone broods over both photographs: this anthropomorphic rock is the hooded monk who used to be the spirit of the place. Do any of the sunbathers realise that he's there, or know what Le Moine means? The exhibition's curator seems to share their blithe ignorance, since there's no reference to that tutelary presence in the accompanying brochure. The Mediterranean has been secularised. </p> <p>The utopian dream remains alive, perhaps, for those who - like Mexican wetbacks wading over the Rio Grande into Texas - pay to be shipped across the Mediterranean in quest of economic benefits. Ad van Denderen, in photographs as grimy as newsprint, documents this clandestine trade in dreams. Iraqi Kurds receive rudimentary English lessons in a square in Athens, memoris ing a few garbled phrases scribbled on cardboard; later, after paying their fares to Albanian middle-men, they embark for Italy. Another gang of smugglers from Morocco dumps a boatload of illegal Africans on a beach in Spain. No Statue of Liberty raises a beacon to welcome the 'wretched refuse' of this 'teeming shore'. </p> <p>Now that continents enviously and aggressively confront each other across it, the Mediterranean has become a militarised zone. Rosell Meseguer photographs defensive ramparts at Cartagena, built by Franco to protect Spain against invaders; in Guy Raz's photographs, innocuous towers for lifeguards in Tel Aviv and Gaza bristle like military lookouts, a reminder that the Mediterranean is the only natural and non-negotiable border Israel can claim. </p> <p>Seas are supposed to join the lands that lie on either side of them, which is why the Greeks and Romans saw the Mediterranean as the earth's circulatory system. Today, the trench divides clashing cultures rather than uniting them. </p> <p>For a few months of the year, our Mediterranean is an insanitary public bath. The rest of the time, it's a minefield. </p> <p><strong>Art: three to see</strong></p> <p><strong> Edward Hopper </strong>Tate Modern, London SE1</p> <p>Finishes today </p> <p><strong> Black President: The Art and Legacy of Fela Anikulapo-Kuti </strong> Barbican, London EC2 <br>From Thursday until 24 October. </p> <p><strong>Mary Ellen Mark: American Odyssey and Twins</strong> Manchester Art Gallery <br>Ends today.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Mark Lanegan </strong>Islington Academy, London N1</p> <p>In the London flat where I have been staying for the past two weeks, I have been woken every morning at five o'clock by the sound of the man downstairs retching. It's a religious thing, apparently - he is voiding his soul of demons. I get my own back each night by playing Mark Lanegan's album, Bubblegum, at top volume. This, too, is the sound of a man voiding his soul of demons. Is it religious? Well, not exactly. But you could argue that Lanegan is the leader of a small cult. </p> <p>What meagre fame he has accumulated over the years has been mostly by association. He was friends with Kurt Cobain and the Gun Club's Jeffrey Lee Pierce, both of whom died young. Lanegan, despite a prodigious drugs-and-drink intake, survived. Read any article about him now and the word 'survivor' is bound to crop up. He has an appearance and a voice to match this label: a beat-up but noble face; a deadpan, laconic manner; and a vocal style reminiscent of Tom Waits. </p> <p>He began his career 18 years ago as singer with grunge band the Screaming Trees, but since 1990 has produced a steady flow of solo albums, as well as joining, albeit briefly, Queens of the Stone Age, many people's choice for band of the decade. Two members of that (now defunct) band - Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri - turn up on the inappropriately named Bubblegum , which came out last month. But they are far from the only guests: PJ Harvey, Greg Dulli, formerly of the Afghan Whigs, and Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses, among others, also lend their support. </p> <p>None of these luminaries appears at Islington Academy on Wednesday, but that does not lessen the show's impact. Indeed, it perhaps intensifies it; with an unshifting (and unglamorous) line-up flanking Lanegan on stage - and the light-show so dim that they are all rendered as silhouettes - the focus is solely on the music. </p> <p>In terms of songwriting, Lanegan has moved far away from the two-dimensional conventions of heavy rock towards a more mysterious, blues-soaked landscape. The opening two songs - 'When Your Number Isn't Up' and 'Hit the City' - illustrate this well. The first, about a man in a hotel room on the edge of death, is sparse and glowering, and would fit neatly on Nick Cave's album of piano ballads, The Boatman's Call. The second, an erotically charged rock number, could almost be a lost single from PJ Harvey's Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea. </p> <p>Islington Academy is not the most atmospheric of venues: lousy acoustics and the bars brighter than the stage. It is to Lanegan's credit that he overcomes these handicaps to give a performance which, even if only fitfully, makes you believe you are in a bourbon-smelling shack somewhere near the Mississippi. </p> <p>The songs, though all of a high quality, are a bit up and down in terms of the intensity of their delivery. For me, there are three high points. The first is 'Resurrection Song', a ghostly three-minute ballad from 2001's Field Songs, here prolonged into something immense, slow-burning and mesmerically repetitive. The second is a tender cover of soul singer Brook Benton's straightforward love song, 'I'll Take Care of You'. </p> <p>The third is 'Methamphetamine Blues', which, on record, sounded not much more than a generic industrial-grind rock song. Here, however, it is transformed into an awesome steamroller of noise; a crucible of desire and fear, sex and death; the sound of Lanegan's demons escaping into the night.</p>",
  "<p>If there is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at Sainsbury's this weekend, it is hardly surprising. The share price shot up last Thursday on heavy trading as bid rumours swirled. Was it Philip Green, fresh from his Marks &amp; Spencer defeat, turning his billion-pound gun back towards Holborn? </p> <p>Well, no. Green went on record to say the speculation was 'rubbish'. He added: 'I've been back in the UK for 48 hours [after an extended summer holiday] and haven't talked to anyone.' </p> <p>Since it emerged during the M&amp;S wrangle that Green had approached Peter Davis about Sainsbury's last year his name has been added to the list of interested parties. </p> <p>Sources close to Sainsbury's say that if Green is interested it is more likely to be as a clothing supplier. The logic would be that he could expand sales beyond his bricks-and-mortar empire - including Top Shop, Bhs and Dorothy Perkins - without acquiring a whole new business to do it. After all, it never did George Davies any harm at M&amp;S. </p> <p>But, in the short-term, shareholders may be looking hopefully elsewhere for somebody to take the business off their hands. </p> <p>This newspaper revealed last month that executives from Target, the number two American discount retailer after Wal-Mart, had a meeting at Sainsbury's Holborn headquarters. Retail sources say the Target teams, who visited the UK once earlier this year and once last year, appeared to know Sainsbury's well and expressed regret that they had missed out on Safeway. </p> <p>Target has so far declined to comment, and Sainsbury's has denied that any deal talks have taken place. </p> <p>Sainsbury's itself has grown used to spikes in the share price and is well-practised at the standard response: 'We do not comment on bid speculation.' </p> <p>What was interesting about last week's squeeze on the stock was that it did not drop right back on Friday following Green's denial. </p> <p>As with Marks &amp; Spencer there are plenty of retail experts queuing up to explain why Sainsbury's is a difficult target. At the top of the list is the role of the Sainsbury family, which controls almost 35 per cent of the stock. If they do not wish to sell, it cannot be sold. </p> <p>Then there is the size of the business, valued at about \u00a34.6 billion, and its leasehold liability, which makes gearing the business more difficult. </p> <p>Add in the competitive supermarket sector, with the Tesco juggernaut seemingly unstoppable and Asda backed by mighty Wal-Mart, and the argument goes that it would be a brave soul who thought they could make good money out of Sainsbury's. </p> <p>Interest might come from America, although the recent mergers and acquisitions track record - Wal-Mart/Asda aside - shows that straight retail acquisitions tend to be relatively tiny. This year, Whole Foods of Austin, Texas bought organic chain Fresh &amp; Wild in January, and Borders book chain bought Paperchase in July. According to M&amp;A data experts Zephyr, of more than 30,000 M&amp;A deals done by US companies in Britain in the past four years, just over 100 were in the retail sector. </p> <p>Christopher Lewey, of Close Brothers Corporate Finance, said: 'Most retailers are not international businesses. Consumers differ from country to country, except possibly in the basic food and discount end of the market. In terms of private equity interest, most of the low-hanging fruit has already been taken in the UK during the past four or five years. There is probably more downside in UK retail now than upside.' </p> <p>The chief interest is in 'big box' retailing, says America's Retail Industry Leaders' Association, a trade organisation. 'UK retailing has relatively fewer hypermarkets, \"category killers\" or discount format stores [than the US],' says a spokeswoman. 'The lack of a true, deep-discount sector in UK food retailing or price-focused, large format makes it appealing. </p> <p>'Some consumer studies we have seen on shopping behaviour in the UK show that consumers favour one-stop shopping that is convenient. A number of our US operators have business models that are quite good at this. Although the costs [property, rent, transportation and logistics] can be higher, there are also similarities between the US and UK operational and regulatory environment. We have a shared language, a similar culture both from a consumer standpoint and an employee standpoint, and the UK can, and is often, used as an entry point into the rest of Europe.' </p> <p>American institution KKR was known to have been interested in Safeway, but has no interest in Sainsbury's at present. It is one of the few finance providers that could combine its US and European funds to raise the kind of money needed to buy Sainsbury's. </p> <p>UK analysts say it would take a consortium of four or five venture capital companies to buy the chain because no one fund would be able to raise the equity. Permira, for example, has just raised its fourth European fund of \u20ac5bn. </p> <p>Nathan Self, of CSFB, said: 'You are more likely to see a pack of jackals dragging down a dying wildebeest than a lion killing it off quickly.' </p> <p>If nobody can pinpoint the source of last week's surge of interest, it is at least easy to see why Sainsbury's is regarded by many as a target. It issued a dire profits warning in July. New chief executive Justin King has promised to present a rescue plan on 19 October, a day that is shaping up to be almost as significant as 12 July was for Stuart Rose at M&amp;S. </p> <p>The signs are that what he has found so far has not been good. Last week Sainsbury's announced the departure of Martin White, the man in charge of the \u00a3400 million splurge on a new distribution network. To replace him comes Lawrence Christensen, ex-Safeway, who hits retirement age in 16 months' time. </p> <p>That Sainsbury's is a basket case is disputed by few. Analyst David Stoddart of Teather &amp; Greenwood said he would be astonished if anybody wanted it. 'It's a bit like your mother knocking a pan of boiling water off a stove and telling you to catch it,' he said, also pointing to the strength of competition from Tesco and Asda. </p> <p>Sainsbury's has been careful not to promise a quick fix for profits: the drive to increase sales has already demanded price cuts on the shop floor - and they cost money. </p> <p>Unless and until King can show how the core supermarket chain can increase profits, however, Sainsbury's will continue to be everybody's favourite retail target rumour.</p>",
  "<p>As a curious, erudite 50-year-old with an interesting life, Neil Tennant is entertaining on almost anything you care to throw at him - music, art, politics, travel - and as an ex-journalist (he wrote for Smash Hits from 1982-85), he's careful to entertain in quotable form. You could just leave Neil alone with your tape recorder, let him rattle on for an hour, come back and you would have more than enough material for an article. </p> <p>Mostly, he's interviewed with his fellow Pet Shop Boy, Chris Lowe, who doesn't talk as much. What Chris does is punctuate Neil's flow, deflate his theories with a daft comment or snuffly jokes. This corresponds with the way their music is commonly viewed: Neil's romantic, clever lyrics, skewered and made hilarious by Chris's disco-bunny beats. Though, of course, it's not as simple as that. Plus, the Pet Shop Boys have often chosen to branch out from straightforward pop - into art (collaborating with Sam Taylor-Wood), West End musicals (they wrote Closer To Heaven with Jonathan Harvey) and one-offs, such as co-compiling an LP of No\u00ebl Coward songs or writing a piece of music to accompany 1999's total eclipse. Over the 23 years they've been together, they've worked with people as varied as Zaha Hadid, Derek Jarman, Dusty Springfield, Liza Minnelli, Bruce Weber, Martin Parr and Johnny Marr. </p> <p>Although we are in a recording studio, today isn't a straightforward pop day - as we shall see. Well, Chris is in the studio with a couple of techno boffins and DJ/producer Dave Dorrell; Neil and I are in the room next door. Chris isn't doing this interview. Probably because he can't be bothered. Doesn't that annoy Neil? </p> <p>'Oh no. Chris and I are very different people, but we never really fall out,' says Neil. 'Occasionally we bicker a bit. But we've known each other such a long time, and though this sounds corny and showbiz, we still make each other laugh. And we've been through things that no one else has been through. There's no one else I know who has had a number one in America, and has written a score to Battleship Potemkin.' </p> <p>The number one in America was in 1986, with the Pet Shop Boys' very first hit single, 'West End Girls'; the Battleship Potemkin part will happen next Sunday in Trafalgar Square and is why they're in a recording studio. A free event - 'we've always liked an event' - produced by the ICA. Sergei Eisenstein's groundbreaking silent film will be shown on a vast screen in front of Nelson's column, while Neil and Chris perform their new score live. They've brought in the Dresden Sinfonica to play some of it, and have engaged Theatre de Complicite's Simon McBurney for the staging. Which all adds up to something much more than just pictures and music. 'Well, you have to fulfil the potential. Or at least try to fulfil the potential. Often we miss, but we do always try.' </p> <p>Neil is nervous about what's going to happen: 'I keep waking up in the night, panicking.' There are so many factors - whether anyone will turn up (free events mean no advertising and a less committed audience), whether the weather will hold. Recently, La Boh\u00e8me in Trafalgar Square was cancelled 15 minutes before its start because of freak weather. Neil was there: 'It was terrifying to see,' he says. </p> <p>'I'm obsessed with live sound,' he adds, 'because you do the whole thing, all your music and then you hand it over to someone else who mixes it. A lot of sound engineers don't understand electronic music, they're used to rock; so they go for the drums and if I start to sing, they whack it up. I'm always going: \"Turn me down, turn me down!\" which isn't very lead singer. I'm worried that I'll wake up on Monday morning and people will go: \"Oh yeah, it was great, but the sound was terrible...\"' </p> <p>Lots to think about, then. But Neil likes it that way: 'This is one of the most engrossing projects I've ever been involved in. I've really enjoyed it.' This is despite the fact that it wasn't the Pet Shop Boys' idea - the ICA's head, Philip Dodd, approached them back in April 2003. They agreed, watched Battleship Potemkin twice on DVD, and then started from the beginning - 'with this kind of \"boompf!\" noise at the credits. We thought, \"Great! That's 30 seconds done.\" I kept counting down: only 73 and a half minutes to go...' </p> <p>Due to problems with sponsorship (everyone involved is doing this for free), the ICA had to push the original performance date back, which gave Neil and Chris even more time to immerse themselves in the project. Typically, they decided they wanted an orchestra, although they had been told 'no'. Then Neil was listening to a contemporary German classical music CD, Mein Herz Brennt , composed by Torsten Rasch and based on the music of terrible rock band Rammstein. Neil thought it was a great CD, and emailed an address on the back asking if Rasch would get involved with the Potemkin project. Much to-ing and fro-ing later - Rasch's initial compositions were too avant garde, even for the Pet Shop Boys - and now Sunday's performance will include entirely new contemporary classical musical passages played by the 26-piece orchestra from Germany which is flying in specially. 'So ha! to no orchestra,' says Neil. </p> <p>But what Tennant has really become involved in, surprisingly but inevitably, is the politics of the event. Battleship Potemkin is a political film. It tells the 1905 story of a Russian ship's crew rising up against its masters and trying to start a revolution in Odessa. Its hero, Vakulinchuk, is killed on board the ship. When his body is laid out in Odessa's dockyard, the citizens rally round and join the sailors in their revolt until the Cossacks come and slaughter the people on the harbour steps. The Odessa Steps sequence is one of the most famous ever filmed, and includes the oft-reprised shot of a baby in a pram bumping down the stairs as people are murdered all around. 'Battleship Potemkin is a Bolshevik propaganda film,' says Neil. 'Though I said that to Chris and he said: \"No, it's a very romantic film about people rising up against oppression.\" It's both, really.' </p> <p>Because of the film, Neil and Chris have become interested in the idea of Trafalgar Square as a political space. 'If you think about the bottom of Nelson's column,' says Neil, 'you see Michael Foot giving a speech at a CND demonstration. You see the poll tax riots, which brought down Mrs Thatcher, or Nelson Mandela speaking... The audience will sit with their backs to the National Gallery, so they can see the Houses of Parliament in the distance. We're staging it like a political meeting.' </p> <p>I start to talk about the 2003 anti-Iraq war demonstration, the biggest ever seen in Trafalgar Square. This chimes with Neil. He was pro-war, because he read The Threatening Storm, a book written by ex-Clinton administration stalwart Kenneth Pollack, who considered all the options for dealing with Saddam and came to the conclusion that regime change was the only choice. Apparently, The Threatening Storm was required reading by Bush's team, and, Neil insists, was what led Blair to the same conclusion. Anyway, Neil read it too, and agreed. </p> <p>'But I thought the anti-war march was a good thing,' he says, 'because I thought it showed the government that what they were about to do was very controversial. They couldn't just say: \"Oh this lot can fuck off,\" because that was Tony Blair's constituency marching past. It meant they really had to focus on what they were doing, be serious and present a serious case for war. Yet that case was only partially made. Which is why I think people who were in favour of the war feel disillusioned. I was in favour of getting rid of Saddam - as, I think, the majority of people were - but you can't help but feel disillusioned by the peace.' </p> <p>With such thoughts rattling around his head, when he was writing the melody for the Odessa Steps sequence, Neil found himself singing the words, 'How come we went to war?' And they seemed to fit. 'The 1905 revolution didn't work. They had to wait another 12 years and then there's the question of whether it was good that the Bolshevik revolution happened. I think the answer has to be \"no,\"' he says. 'And these questions and this film all feel timely, because this is the most political time of my life. I think the Iraq war is the Spanish Civil War of our generation. People are very divided about it. And people feel disenfranchised. I don't think they feel unheard, but I think they feel that they don't have an effect.' </p> <p>Tennant is utterly absorbed in this project, thoroughly taken over. Yet he can't help himself; he will spin off into less serious subjects. From discussing political futility and apathy, we somehow find ourselves talking about Smash Hits. My first writing job was there, three years after Neil had left, and both of us adored the magazine when we worked for it. I say, rather idly, that I think Smash Hits' particular approach to the world in the Eighties - pop music and jokes - has taken over the whole of the British press. Neil, who used to be assistant editor, pounces. </p> <p>'No, no,' he says, 'I think the humour of Smash Hits has been skimmed off the top and applied across the media, but the real commitment underneath it hasn't been pulled out. So now, you get the flippancy of Smash Hits, without the true belief in pop music. And that's destructive. Nowadays, people pretend. Like they pretend the Reading festival's great. It's not, it's a shit-heap in a car-park, but everyone pretends \"Yeah it's great\" 'cos they've heard that's what you do at rock festivals.' </p> <p>Ooh, he is grand, Neil, at times. Lord of his manor. It's because he's a pop star, of course, but also, perhaps, because he is used to being single and therefore 'rather selfish'. He's been in love four times. 'Two women, two men, in chronological order,' but after his last relationship ended, a few years ago, he has found himself enjoying life solo. 'The problem is: it's quite nice. Comfortable. I have a very busy life, with a lot of friends. I'm gregarious, but I like solitude, I like to shut the door and be alone, and I think I can be selfish about that, about my own space. I'm probably not trying hard enough to meet someone.' </p> <p>When he's at his house in Chelsea, Neil goes out all the time. At his other home, in county Durham, (Neil is originally from North Shields), he stays in and works with Chris. It was there that they wrote most of the Battleship Potemkin score. Neil's recording routine is: get up at 9.30am, have breakfast listening to Radio 3 and reading a magazine - New Statesman, The Spectator, Word, Frieze, the TLS. No papers: 'They have too much stuff that isn't news in them. I think someone should publish a paper like the ones 100 years ago, all the adverts on the front and then, inside, nothing but news. No pictures.' After a spot of emailing, it's into the studio about 11.30am (Chris will have stayed the night in his part of the house). Work, lunch, work, then a glass of wine at 7 o'clock 'on the dot'. Dinner, then more work. That's when they get most done, possibly because of the alcohol. </p> <p>It sounds a lovely life, I think, relaxed, yet fruitful. 'Well, I've never had a boring job,' pronounces Neil, 'because I've always thought that if you put your mind to it, you can do what you want to do. I refuse to be restricted by background or fear.' </p> <p>Which is, of course, one of the messages of Battleship Potemkin. We go into the studio to watch the Odessa Steps sequence with the Pet Shop Boys' music. I'd forgotten the power of those terrible images - the gothic faces, the scampering panic, the static, deliberate murder. And watching them, hearing Neil's plaintive voice over swelling, mournful music, I feel overwhelmed. And this, on a tiny screen, in a room filled with techno-bods. If they pull it off, next Sunday's event should be a head-shatterer.</p>",
  "There is something rather humiliating about the admiration gushing visibly from France's finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy towards Tom Cruise in the pictures released after a peculiar hour-long summit this week between the politician and film star. <p>Sarkozy is too awestruck to remember to look dignified and is smiling with embarrassing enthusiasm. No politician can look handsome when he is standing next to an A-list Hollywood actor, and the juxtaposition of the two men is unkind. Sarkozy even looks shorter than the famously tiny Cruise. </p> <p>But in the glamour-free world of French politics, Sarkozy is an action hero in his own right. Relentlessly energetic and constantly promoting his mission to save the nation, France's former 'premier flic' (top cop) clearly identifies with Cruise. His announcement on Wednesday that he will run for the leadership of France's ruling centre-right political party, the UMP, marks a crucial step in his unstoppable campaign to rise to the summit of French politics and seize the presidency from Jacques Chirac in 2007. He is certain to win the UMP leadership race, and with the party as his launchpad, Sarkozy, France's most popular politician, is in a powerful position to shape the post-Chirac era of French politics. </p> <p>Particularly gratifying for the finance minister was the President's decision to approve his candidacy, calling a temporary ceasefire to the feud between the elder statesman and his treacherous former protege which has animated French political life for years. Sarkozy's announcement was greeted by the President with friendly, but ultimately hollow, promises of support. </p> <p>Some analysts speculate that Chirac is gambling that his finance minister, who will have to give up his ministerial post once he begins the campaign, will drift into oblivion, swallowed up by the tedium of party electioneering. Chirac could then stand for a third presidential term in 2007 or manoeuvre his chosen successor into the post, thus preserving his political legacy. These are feeble hopes. Sarkozy has been planning his route to power for the past 25 years. Now he is gearing up for the final stages, which promise to be characterised by the hyperactive drive and unblushing ambition that have driven his career so far. </p> <p>BORN IN 1955 in Paris, Sarkozy's father was a Hungarian aristocrat who had come to France as a refugee. His mother worked as a lawyer. Their son plunged himself into politics at a precocious age, and was active in the Gaullist party's youth movement as a teenager. </p> <p>Chirac, then prime minister, spotted the young law student's talents at a conference in 1976 and invited him to Paris. Sarkozy swiftly made himself indispensable to the prime minister, who adopted him as a family friend and began grooming him for power. </p> <p>Their friendship was as powerful as their enmity has now become, and for a while it looked as if Chirac had found his successor. With Chirac's support a meteoric rise began, and in 1983, at 28, Sarkozy was elected France's youngest mayor, in the Parisian suburb of Neuilly. </p> <p>Two events destroyed his position as Chirac's spiritual son. The first, a little talked about extra-marital romance with the President's daughter Claude, which turned the first lady, Bernadette, resolutely against her husband's protege. The second was his decision in 1995 to support a rival right-wing presidential candidate, Edouard Balladur, against Chirac. </p> <p>For three years the men did not speak, but Chirac has subsequently been forced to tolerate Sarkozy, who is an irreplaceable electoral asset for the right. After a series of dismal results in regional and European polls earlier this year, and with the former UMP leader Alain Jupp\u00e9 convicted of corruption, the party needs him desperately. </p> <p>Where there was once affection, now there is scarcely disguised animosity and their simmering venom explodes periodically into bouts of spiteful backbiting. Chirac lets it be know that Sarkozy's 'insolence' exasperates him and has done his best to frustrate his ambitions, promoting the perennially unpopular, but much more biddable, Jean-Pierre Raffarin over him to prime minister in 2002. </p> <p>The thin coating of courtesy cracked spectacularly during the president's Bastille Day interview this year. On live television he lashed out with casual contempt: 'There is no disagreement with Mr Sarkozy for one simple reason. I decide; he carries out my orders.' </p> <p>But despite these attempts to squash him, Sarkozy's popularity ratings inch ever higher. 'The more they attack me, the more I advance,' he says. </p> <p>Sarkozy hits back in his own style. Colleagues have heard him berate those who disagree with him, muttering: 'You're as stupid as Chirac.' His message is simple: after 35 years at the summit of French politics, Chirac, 71, is past his sell by date. </p> <p>'In politics, you have to know when it is time to give up your place,' he said in a television interview. Asked whether he liked to fantasise about being president when he shaves every morning, he replied: 'Yes, and not only when I'm shaving.' </p> <p>His best response to the humiliation of the Bastille Day remarks was an eight-page Hello!- style interview given to Paris Match . Photographs showed Sarkozy, 49, jogging with his wife along a sandy beach, and playing football (in strangely inappropriate slip-on shoes) with his son. </p> <p>The effect was to remind readers that he is the younger, more energetic figure. His dynamism is a powerful tool at a time when political commentators are whispering that they think Chirac may be going deaf. </p> <p>Hyperactivity has become his trademark, causing tensions with some of his cabinet colleagues, put to shame by his unstoppable drive. His bizarre notion of what constitutes a summer holiday is to move with his family to a quiet seaside resort, invite key members of his political entourage to join him, hold daily press conferences and pose occasionally for photos, looking almost relaxed on a bicycle. The worst that rivals can say is: 'Sarkozy does too much. That's his achilles heel.' </p> <p>When he was appointed interior minister in 2002 he got over his disappoint ment at not getting the top job by racing around France, meeting firemen and police officers, tracking Corsican terrorists, comforting victims of national tragedy. Accompanied everywhere by a pack of journalists, his efforts were recorded nightly on the nation's news bulletins. </p> <p>Sarkozy has a populist touch. He does not come from the Ecole Nationale d'Administration - which traditionally trains France's senior public servants - and his language is consequentially more straightfoward than that of his rivals. </p> <p>An early piece of legislation for which he was responsible as interior minister banned flag-burning and booing during the Marseillaise. He is an accomplished networker. The fact that it was Cruise who requested this private meeting reflects this ability to spin a global web of contacts. </p> <p>His move to the finance ministry has denied him many of these photo opportunities. Jealous colleagues (of whom there are many) speculated this week that he would be grinding his teeth at having no role to play in the government's attempts to liberate the two French hostages from Iraq. Sarkozy thrives on crisis and as a young politician helped negotiate the release of school-children taken hostage in Neuilly. </p> <p>His centre-right politics are pragmatic. As interior minister he successfully seized ground from the National Front by talking tough on crime. He admires Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and would like to see France improve relations with Britain and America. He believes affirmative action is the way to help France's excluded minorities into the mainstream. </p> <p>He describes himself as a liberal reformer, believes in deregulation of the state, favours cutting taxes and wants to get rid of the 35 hour week. 'I don't care about ideology. I do what works,' he says. </p> <p>Sarkozy has more battles ahead before the 2007 elections. In the Elys\u00e9e palace, presidential aides talk of a policy known as TSS - tout sauf Sarkozy (anyone but Sarkozy) - and despite his professions of support, Chirac is thought to be preparing his new interior minister Dominque de Villepin for greater power. </p> <p>But the finance minister has developed a skin tough enough shield him against future attacks from his boss. 'I've made a lot of sacrifices since I went into politics. I've been wounded and I've got scars all over,' he says. 'But I don't feel resentment or bitterness. If you want to go far you have to ignore these setbacks.' </p> <p><b> Nicolas Sarkozy</b><br> </p> <p><b> DoB:</b> 28 January 1955 </p> <p><b> Job:</b> France's Finance Minister </p> <p><b> Education:</b> Law degree, Nanterre University, advanced degree in political science Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris </p> <p><b> Family:</b> Married to C\u00e9cilia Ciganer-Albeniz, three children</p>",
  "<p>Britain's prime arms manufacturer, BAE Systems, enters unknown territory this Thursday, facing the world without its erstwhile chairman and chief executive Sir Richard Evans. The company now has a defence newcomer at the top: former BP number two Dick Olver. </p> <p>Olver is expected to take a back seat at Thursday's interim results presentation, allowing his chief executive, Mike Turner, a rare but welcome time to bask in what has been a relatively serene year, and point to the cash funnelling into the business via the Al Yamamah contract with Saudi Arabia which is directly linked to the price of oil. </p> <p>But it is Olver's views of the business that investors and analysts will be seeking to extract. Any answers he gives are likely to be guarded: when he arrived in the spring he commissioned a root and branch strategic review of the company. This is taking an unconventional form, with two US investment banks, house broker Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, carrying out parallel exercises. </p> <p>There are many questions that the reviews will seek to clarify, but industry and financial observers agree that two are fundamental. The first is: does BAE evolve into a company whose prime alliances are transatlantic, or European? The second: does it remain a manufacturer of defence 'platforms' - planes, ships, and tanks - or become a 'systems architect' integrating the different projects so they talk to each other properly - which is where many say the real money is in giant defence projects. There are major differences of opinion, which makes any decision a finely balanced one. </p> <p>For observers, things could not be less clear. The company's 'group strategy' is broken down into seven 'business portfolio actions' which feed into the group's strategic objectives. These include creation of 'a sustainable, profitable business as the UK pro gramme prime contractor in air, land and sea,' as well as becoming 'the UK's system-of-systems architect'.</p> <p>Equally, it states it wants to 'grow the business in the United States', at the same time as saying it aims to 'achieve an optimised European position through a rational portfolio of joint ventures'. </p> <p>The one objective everybody agrees with is to 'grow and maximise the value of Airbus' - currently outstripping Boeing as the world's number one commercial airliner producer - although one analyst acidly points out: 'It may want to increase its stake, and it may find a way of doing so, but it will have to eat a lot of humble pie at Eads (the European Aeronautic Defence and Space company, parent of Airbus), the firm it decided not to form a part of in 1999.' </p> <p>But in the eyes of industry experts and analysts the remaining aims are if not mutually exclusive, then extremely difficult to execute. And in the eyes of others, BAE's actions suggest it is not sticking to the script. </p> <p>Zafar Khan, analyst at SG Securities, says: 'They have put together this group strategy so that they can say they have got everything covered. But what is missing is a sense of direction.' </p> <p>One senior industry figure, who has a part to play in the review, says: 'They are walking this tightrope of trying to look both sides of the Atlantic at once. Both sides want to work more closely with BAE, but to a degree they are saying you have to choose.' </p> <p>BAE can point to the fact that it has developed a high value US business from virtually nothing - last year it contributed \u00a332 million profits from \u00a32.7 billion sales. It can also point to serious European collaboration, including Eurofighter, the MBDA missiles business, Alenia Marconi Systems integration business and Gripen fighters. </p> <p>But the question for the review is, can it grow from these starting points in future? This time last year the 'silver bullet' solution was still in play: a US merger, gaining access to the largest defence budget in the world with one shot. The Evans/Turner partner of choice was Boeing, but BAE was also linked with General Dynamics - allegedly interested in BAE's submarine business - and Lockheed Martin. One by one, however, the Americans got cold feet. </p> <p>Nevertheless, in addition to its successful US business, BAE has a significant role on what may become the biggest defence contract of all time - the F-35 joint strike fighter, which could be worth up to $300bn. BAE acts as a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin on high-value electronic warfare systems. The alliance, it argues, gives it a platform for persuading the Pentagon - its second largest customer after the British Ministry of Defence, it claims - of its capability. </p> <p>But there are significant obstacles to US growth. Chief is the lack of co-operation over the transfer of technology from US companies to foreign ones. This has come to a head with the F-35. As things stand, BAE has difficulty accessing details via software codes of the programme, which is hampering its collaboration. The MOD has battled to get these restrictions lifted, and is now taking a harder line on it. </p> <p>But as one observer said: 'What is absolutely fundamental to BAE's relationship with the US is getting them comfortable in the issue of technology transfer. The current issue is JSF, but that is so large a programme, that even on its own this is a strategic issue. If they are going to grow in the US, which they will have to do via joint ven tures, they have to get this sorted out.' </p> <p>One option would be hiving off BAE's US aerospace business into a joint venture company for the US JSF programme with Lockheed Martin, with separate management and balance sheet and enough control for the US to make them comfortable about sharing information. </p> <p>Meanwhile, there are those in the industry who would be advising a straight European partnership. One senior industry figure who often works with BAE as a partner, says: 'A US merger is out. I have always thought a European strategy is better for BAE anyway, creating a European prime, together with Thales and Eads. They may not be in the US but they would fully be a part of the European industry and there is a chance for growing here.' </p> <p>But there are problems here too. Getting too close to the Europeans would increase suspicion in Washington. But, at the same time, observers believe BAE must move. As one says: 'In Europe, as in America, it is military aircraft that drive things. But if you look at the major programmes in Europe, the Eurofighter, Gripen and Rafale have all peaked and are all going to tail off in the coming decade. This will spark consolidation in Europe, and BAE has a choice as to whether to be part of that or not. It is not difficult to see the benefits of being on the inside.' </p> <p>Wherever it operates, the other key question is what it does. Should it continue as programme prime contractor in air land and sea or focus on being a 'systems architect'? </p> <p>Khan says: ' I am a bit confused on this. It says it wants to be a prime in air land and sea, and buys Alvis [the armoured vehicle maker] which makes sense. But at the same time it puts its shipyards [on the Clyde and at Barrow in Furness] up for sale.' The timing raised eyebrows - two of the largest naval programmes for years, for a pair of new aircraft carriers and a fleet of new destroyers are in progress. 'Also, the air land and sea \"unique selling point\" works only if you are a good systems integrator, and BAE has not shown this in the past.' </p> <p>There is a divergence of opinion on how BAE should clear up these issues. One expert says: 'There is a view that as a systems architect you get the high value work by overseeing major projects, without having to own lower-value manufacturing businesses.' </p> <p>But another says: 'Why give up your expertise in manufacturing and platforms? This is how projects are still procured both in Europe and the US. BAE is involved in some very high-value systems work, as well as building the platforms themselves, and it can make money on both.' </p> <p>In addition, much of BAE's industrial and political muscle in the UK is from the 19,000 people in its programmes division, the heart of its manufacturing operations. 'The point is learning how to do this and getting on with it instead of complaining. That requires a change of culture, and would be the really valuable legacy of a strategic review,' says an adviser.</p> <p>Olver, as a defence outsider from a highly commercial, asset-based company, might manage it. The first clues should emerge next week.</p>",
  "<p>Meet the newest conqueror of the Wild East. You wouldn't expect an obscure lawyer from Copenhagen to be perhaps the single most successful investor in Russia since the collapse of the Berlin Wall. But BP, Shell and all those seeking fortunes in Russia's bracing business environment could learn a thing or two, apparently, from Jeffrey Galmond. </p> <p>Galmond, it transpires, is the owner of Ipoc, which hit the headlines 10 days ago after scoring a significant victory in its long-running legal battle with Alfa Group, the oil and banking conglomerate run by controversial Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman. </p> <p>The dispute is over who owns a major stake in one of the country's leading mobile phone companies, and contains enough of those familiar Russian allegations of double-dealing and financial chicanery to make even the most hardened Western investor quail. </p> <p>So it's doubly surprising to survey the charmed life Galmond has enjoyed in 15 years of doing business there. </p> <p>The 54-year-old built a modestly successful legal practice in Denmark before starting to advise numerous European clients on Russian investments in the early Nineties. Details of his subsequent career are not widely known but he seems quickly to have become a serial investor himself, making canny plunges into Russia's property and telecoms markets. </p> <p>Galmond's involvement in TCI, a leading Russian telephony firm, netted him a fortune and was apparently only one of several business coups. </p> <p>So far, he's also proved himself more than capable of holding his own in a knockabout court fight with Fridman, one of Russia's richest men. Galmond's story is all the more remarkable for being so little recognised until now. </p> <p>Ipoc has stakes in numerous telecoms, media and IT firms - enough, it is speculated, to propel Galmond into the billionaire league - yet his status as the company's owner, rather than merely its boss, was only revealed during the court proceedings. Ipoc is based in Bermuda, an offshore haven with minimal disclosure requirements, and had previously described itself as an international investment fund serving a number of (unnamed) Russian and Western investors. </p> <p>Ipoc and Fridman's Alfa are fighting over a 25 per cent shareholding in MegaFon, the third-largest mobile phone company in Russia. The complex case is being fought in half a dozen legal jurisdictions; with so much at stake, that may not be surprising. </p> <p>MegaFon, part-owned by Norwegian telecoms giant TeliaSonera, among others, has long been earmarked for a possible \u00a31 billion flotation in London and could prove a fantastically valuable asset. </p> <p>Ipoc says it agreed to buy the 25 per cent from Russian-based investor LV Finance in 2001, and handed over about $74 million in transfers and loans towards the purchase. But Alfa, it is alleged, bought LV Finance in August 2003 and unlawfully transferred the stake into its own portfolio. </p> <p>Alfa, which is keen to foster closer links with Western businesses, challenges this version of events, insisting the MegaFon shareholding is its property and that this was a 'genuine and proper commercial transaction'. </p> <p>Fridman's company was recently dealt a blow, however, by the International Chamber of Commerce arbitration tribunal in Geneva, which ruled that Ipoc is the rightful owner of the stake. </p> <p>Although Alfa was not directly involved in the Geneva proceedings, which Ipoc had brought instead against LV Finance, the tribunal came to some damaging conclusions about Alfa's role. These included the observation that Fridman's firm tried to take control of the MegaFon stake even though it knew that Ipoc had a prior legal claim to it. </p> <p>Alfa furiously denies this, and the Geneva ruling, though a setback for Fridman, is not the end of the matter. Technically, the ruling governs only a fraction of the 25 per cent MegaFon stake under dispute. To get its hands on the rest, Ipoc will have to secure a similar judgment from an arbitration court in Zurich this autumn. Even then, it would have to go to court in the British Virgin Islands to get the judgment enforced. </p> <p>In the meantime, there has been plenty of mud-slinging. Last year Ipoc was embarrassed by the revelation that Vidya Sharma, its former president, had a conviction for fraud. </p> <p>Ipoc said it had been unaware of the conviction and that Sharma left the firm on the day it emerged. The firm has also been forced to deny that it is a front organisation for Leonid Reiman, Rus sia's communications minister and a former business associate of Galmond's. </p> <p>On the other side, timely reminders have surfaced of an old and embarrassing row between Fridman and BP over the ownership of Russian oil firm Sidanco, although relations were patched up and Fridman is now a major strategic partner of the British oil giant. </p> <p>And in a separate sign of the murkiness threatening to envelop proceedings, Alfa and Ipoc have both denied spying on the chairman of the Geneva panel after it was found that Kroll, the private investigator, had put him under surveil lance. Swiss police are currently investigating the matter. </p> <p>The Kroll issue is typical of the many blind alleys into which this labyrinthine dispute appears to have turned. Delayed hearings, asset freezes and debates over jurisdiction have all held things up. And all the while a cloud of uncertainty hangs over MegaFon itself, with key strategic decisions inevitably delayed until its future ownership is sorted out - hardly an ideal situation in the fast-moving world of mobile telecoms. </p> <p>Galmond is unmistakably the victor in round one of his legal fight with Fridman. But in such a long and bruising bout, can either truly emerge as the winner?</p>",
  "For Borik Rubaiv and hundreds of other pupils at Beslan's Middle School Number One, it was to have been a celebration of the first day of the new school term. Parents carried flowers and teachers wore their best clothes. A Tannoy played music while the children formed lines alphabetically around the swing bars on the playground lawn. <p>It was some of the older children who noticed them first - a masked group quickly crossing the railway tracks that run behind the school. Some, giggling, thought it was a joke at first, until they picked up the anxiety of the adults waving at them to run. </p> <p>'The kids first ran towards them and then they ran back towards us in the school. Within moments, we were surrounded,' said Borik's aunt, Vala Hosanova </p> <p>Some of the children further back were luckier. Diana Kubalova, 14, ran with some of her classmates, a parent and a teacher back into the boiler room, in the bowels of the school. There they hid as Russia's worst-ever hostage crisis unfolded. Back in the playground, the militants quickly got their bearings. 'They asked us where the sports hall was,' said Hosanova. 'They then said that, if we did not go in there immediately, we would all be shot.' </p> <p>According to witnesses, this was not the only group of terrorists. Another band had infiltrated the school in a van. </p> <p>While his friends were lining up, Soslan Bigayev, 13, had been wandering around the school looking at the renovation work that had been done. Thirsty, he headed for a water fountain. </p> <p>'I thank God that I became thirsty. It saved my life.' While he was drinking, the second group drove into the school. 'Men jumped out of the van,' Bigayev said. 'One of them had a long ginger beard, thick bushy eyebrows and a red-and-green skull-cap. He fired an automatic rifle into the air. I knew immediately that they were terrorists because of all the other attacks that I've seen on TV over the past few days.' </p> <p>Bigayev fled. His friends fared worse. Caught between gunmen coming from two sides, an estimated 1,000 children, teachers and parents were herded at gunpoint into the gym, a new building about 10 metres wide and 25 metres long. </p> <p>The first act of their captors was to order adults to hand over their mobile phones and cameras. It was the first sign that the militants had prepared well for their siege. Two years ago, when Chechen terrorists seized 800 theatre-goers in the Dubrovka theatre in Moscow, mobile phone calls had played a seminal role in helping the authorities to map out the layout of the crisis. Here, there would be no such errors and they would not be identified if they escaped. </p> <p>And now it appears the planning had gone far further than learning from past mistakes. According to Russian state security officials, the gunmen and women had pre-planted extra weapons and explosives, smuggled into the school during rebuilding work over the summer holidays, and hidden them beneath floorboards. </p> <p>As the militants filed through the school's corridors, one of Kubalova's friends peered through a crack in the door to see men with impressive beards - and two women wearing face masks and suicide bomber belts - march around the school, talking in Russian to each other, with what sounded like strong Chechen accents. </p> <p>At that moment, Kubalova came across an Ossetian man, to whom she whispered for help. The militants heard, and ran towards the group, grabbing some, but allowing 14 to escape. The news of the seige of School Number One was out. </p> <p>As local police rushed towards the red brick building, grabbing whatever escapees they could, the first exchanges of gunfire began and the first casualties fell dead. </p> <p>Anatoli Sikoyev, a parent in his fifties who was recovering from a stroke, made a desperate dash to save his child that nearly cost him his life. </p> <p>'When I heard the news, I rushed to school to save my family' he said from hospital that evening. 'I approached the schoolyard and came across a man with a huge beard. </p> <p>'He shouted at me: \"Lie down and crawl backwards\". I could not lie down, so I bent over and began to move back. Then another man shot at me from a window, hitting my hand and skimming my head. Now I am helpless and here.' </p> <p>As the gunmen fired out of the windows at fleeing parents and children, inside the school the terrorists were also separating men from women, according to witnesses shooting several male teachers in the process. </p> <p>Inside the gym, the terrorists were also busy rigging up a series of bombs. Two wires were run from the basketball hoops at either side of the hall. On these wires, and on the hoops, mines, each the size of a Mars bar, were intermittently strewn. The walls and entrances were also booby-trapped, and two large plastic containers were put in the middle of the floor. </p> <p>The militants had also set the men to work dragging a cupboard across the gym's main entrance, blocking it off, before they were marched to another room. </p> <p>And as the fighters' leaders introduced themselves to their captives by their noms de guerre, any doubts that they had about the identity of their kidnappers and the peril they were in were quickly dispelled. </p> <p>According to the Kommer sant newspaper, they called themselves Magas, Fantomas and Abdullah, the first two of whom were associates of the notorious Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev. </p> <p>The newspaper identified Magas as Magomed Yevloyev, an Ingush who organised the bloody raid on Ingushetia on 22 June, in which more than 90 people died. Fantomas is a former bodyguard of Basayev, who is alleged to be an ethnic Russian. </p> <p>Other Russian media identified the leader as Doka Umarov, a Chechen separatist leader. </p> <p>Terrified, the thousand hostages inside the gym tried to adjust to the stifling cattle-truck conditions, leading many to strip off their clothes and others to have panic attacks and breathing difficulties. </p> <p>Children and women had to sit shoulder to shoulder. 'There was not enough room to stretch out your legs,' said Hosanova. 'Sweat was trickling down us. We could not breathe. </p> <p>'They had opened a tiny gap in the windows at the top, but that was having no effect. It was like a sauna in there, but they refused to make it any cooler.' </p> <p>The terrorists moved quickly to establish their control over the captives. 'Three women in suicide bomber belts and masks said that, if we cried or shouted, they would take action', said Hosanova. To ensure the hostages that their rules were not for breaking, they killed a man whom they had caught using his phone. 'We will kill 20 to 40 of you if you use these again', they warned. </p> <p>Outside the school, the chaotic scenes that had greeted the first attempt by local police and militia to rush the building was rapidly settling into an armed stand-off. </p> <p>As the gunmen and bombers inside secured the school's buildings, Russian security forces - including officers from the Ministry of the Interior and OMON - had set up their own perimeters, bringing forward armoured cars and snipers. </p> <p>The residents of Beslan, a town of 35,000, also appeared, some armed with weapons and sporting white armbands to distinguish them from the gunmen. There were perhaps as many as 5,000 of them. </p> <p>Specialist rescue teams had been brought in too from Russia's Ministry of Emergencies, to deal with the crisis. But, for all the preparations, one error would be made that would later contribute to the huge death toll - too few ambulances would be brought up outside the school. </p> <p>And it was not only on the ground, outside Beslan's School Number One, that the security authorities had gone quickly into emergency mode. In the Kremlin, too, the phone lines were buzzing as President Vladimir Putin's officials demanded to know what was going on - and precisely what the kidnappers were demanding. </p> <p>For despite the obvious - that the latest terrorist atrocity was somehow linked to Russia's brutal war in Chechnya - how and why was still not clear. </p> <p>The demands were not to become any little clearer until just a few hours before the siege reached its awful and bloody denouement. </p> <p>North Ossetia's leader, Alexander Dzasokhov, briefed journalists on his knowledge of the negotiations that were already in train. </p> <p>'They said Chechnya should be separate from Russia, be an independent state. But they didn't go beyond this assertion. They didn't say who they would like to talk to, or anything. My impression is that they are cut off from the outside world,' he said. </p> <p>The Russian authorities had already made a decision totally out of keeping with their customary violent approach to Chechen hostage-takers. Faced with the risk of another disaster such as the Moscow theatre siege, which ended in scores being asphyxiated when Russian special forces used gas to subdue all within the auditorium, the Russians would talk. More extraordinarily, the Kremlin would ask for help from Chechen separatist leaders whom it had long regarded as beyond the pale. </p> <p>Unusually, Putin himself, who ordinarily wastes no opportunity to expound his beliefs on Russia's fight against terror and who rose to power on the back of the Chechen threat, at first remained silent. </p> <p>When he finally broke his silence, it was only on Thursday, a day into the siege. And then it was to reinforce the growing belief that Russian forces would negotiate, not storm the building. </p> <p>'Our main task is, of course, to save the life and health of those who became hostages. We understand these acts are not only against private citizens of Russia, but against Russia as a whole. What is happening in North Ossetia is horrible,' he said in remarks shown on Russian television. </p> <p>Inside the school, the terrorists were formulating their demands, which were passed in two notes to police outside. They sought the release of 24 militants arrested after a June raid by suspected Chechen separatists on neighbouring Ingushetia, in which Fantomas and Magas were implicated. They wanted to meet the presidents of Ingushetia and of North Ossetia, and other senior officials. And of course, they made the key and unfulfillable demand - the same that the Dubrovka hostage-takers had - of a complete Russian military withdrawal from Chechnya. At 15:38, they said, they would kill 50 hostages for each one of them who died and kill 20 if they were injured. </p> <p>Inside they made a show of the lethal force they were prepared to use on themselves as well as their thousand hostages. About 20 of the men were gathered up and taken to the second floor of the main school building, to the right of the gym. </p> <p>There, they were shot dead. One survivor said that she thought a female suicide bomber may also have been involved in their murder. Their bodies were thrown out of the windows and left to rot in the afternoon sun. </p> <p>After that, the first night of the siege in the school passed quietly. </p> <p>A few hostages had been allowed to drink water from the taps and showers in the changing rooms next to the gym. Only a few exchanges of gunfire and grenade blasts breached the calm of the siege. </p> <p>But by the following morning, the mood worsened. The militants began the day by upping the stakes. </p> <p>'They smashed the handles off the taps in the changing room so we could not use them', said Hosanova. 'Water became a big problem. We had to wring out our clothes to drink our sweat from them. We even drank our own urine, the children were so thirsty.' </p> <p>Sitting in her flat yesterday, wretchedly awaiting news of her missing sister and niece, she shows with her dress how they demanded the children make a filter of four layers of clothes through which they could drink their own urine. </p> <p>'The smell had become unbelievably bad by then', she said. </p> <p>Inside the school, the tension was rising as conditions worsened. Random grenade blasts and gunfire sent ripples of tension through the crowds, tearful women ducking as explosions rocked the courtyard. </p> <p>Tamara Peroyeva, 63, knew that something would have to give soon. She was sandwiched between two complete strangers, all of them in relative states of undress, writhing around in the grime of the gym floor and their own waste. Her grandson and other kids had used her belly as a pillow and for while they had laid on top of each other to try to keep up their strength. </p> <p>Then the children had decided that chanting might change the militants' minds. 'Water, water, water', went the chant, as if they had forgotten this was not a normal gym class. 'We still had not seen any water, and the kids were crying', she said. 'The terrorists tried shooting in the air to silence them - there was nothing else that appeared to work.' </p> <p>But as night drew in, and the authorities promised again there would be no siege, the chaos grew worse. 'The shooting stopped them crying for five minutes, but then they started up again.' </p> <p>As dawn broke on Friday, Hosanova felt that events were about to take a turn for the worse. </p> <p>The militants told them that, 'If they come at us with tanks, we will fight back until we run out of ammunition. But then we will take your lives as well as our own.' She noticed also that the male militants had begun whispering to each other for the first time, clearly not wanting to be overheard by the hostages. 'If they start a storm then only you will be to blame,' one said. </p> <p>It was at 13:05, just a few moments after traditional Muslim prayers, that the day broke apart. </p> <p>The men from the Russian MInistry of Emergencies had been nervous about their mission, but were keen to do it. After negotiations with the gunmen inside the school, they had been told that they could collect some of the bodies lying both inside and outside the buildings, because dogs had begun to worry some of the corpses. </p> <p>Entering the school in two ambulances, they carefully left their vehicles and crossed to where they could see the first of the bodies, one of them propped up against a car. As the paramedics picked up the first two corpses, the air was rent by two powerful blasts, followed by the sound of small arms fire. </p> <p>As the emergency workers took cover, they saw a middle-aged man emerge from the smoke, wearing only a pair of trousers, covered in dirt. </p> <p>Startled into action by the two explosions, Russian troops staggered forward and began firing at the windows of the school, in an attempt to cover the escape of the bloodied survivors who were beginning to emerge from the building. At the same time, two Russian tanks moved in. </p> <p>Inside the school, Hosanova recalls that she was sitting calmly when the first explosion sounded. She believes that one of the mines strung up between the basketball hoops in the gym had gone off. </p> <p>'We all fell down and held our heads in our hands. We tried to cover the children with our bodies. What else could we do? I was totally disorientated. Those closer to the wall were luckier and did not get injured. Bits of roof and glass were falling everywhere. I looked up and saw that the woman next to me was dead. Children were running everywhere, panicking. A masked militant came near me and took some hostages away with him.' Soon she saw soldier with Spetznaz - Russian special forces - insignia, and was led to safety. </p> <p>Ilfa Gagiyeva ran instinctively for the window when she heard the first blast. Yet before she jumped, she turned back, shocked that she had forgotten her daughter, Diana, seven. She said a second, 'strange-sounding' blast rang out. </p> <p>'I grabbed her and then moved to the changing room. Hassan, one of the militants, was in the toilet during the first explosion and, when he came out, he tried to help people to the window to get fresh air. We stayed in the small hall near the gym for 20 minutes until the Spetznaz reached us.' </p> <p>Outside the school, a scene of utter carnage was unfolding. </p> <p>At the local administration, the doors of the nearby cafe burst open and dozens of children, grimy, bloodied and some limp, were hurriedly carried out into the street by police and bystanders. Helicopters swarmed overhead and automatic gunfire and explosions answered each other. </p> <p>A group of militants appeared to head back over the railway, towards the direction from which they had come. A group of helicopters buzzed after them. Panicked, Spetznaz tried to block the railway, their efforts part-hampered, part-helped by groups of sweaty local men in tracksuits, bearing hunting rifles and eager to get involved in the fight. </p> <p>Nearer the local Palace of Culture, the dead were beginning to be brought out. A seemingly endless stream of stretchers was half-dragged, half-carried toward the school, returning laden with another limp form. A young girl, her sooty form covered in bits of roof insulation. A woman, nearly naked. </p> <p>The closer to the school, the thicker the blood - the Spetznaz troops had been exchanging fire with the gunmen from nearby apartment blocks. The terrorists' grenades had blown them out of the windows. </p> <p>Below, local men were determined to reach their children and wives in the school. They broke through a garage wall that connected with the school's playground. </p> <p>And then came the bodies. Children, alive, blackened, blinking with shock. Dazed mothers. </p> <p>On the other side of the school, events had taken on an Inferno-esque turn. </p> <p>On one side, local men and police gathered, eager to bear stretchers, to end their helpless, hopeless inertia, yet not involved in the military operation. One Alfa special forces soldier involved in the siege angrily told the Gazeta newspaper: 'There would have been a lot fewer victims if the local civilians had not got involved.' </p> <p>An armoured personnel carrier was rammed against the school wall, and a fire truck sat in the centre of the playground where a single red rose lay, its petals mangled, mottled by soot. </p> <p>But the worst was to come - what lay inside the still burning gym. It was revealed as the Russian troops continued to fight the last of the gunmen who had taken the school. At one stage, a tank was called up to clear a basement room. </p> <p>They are scenes that will never be forgotten by those who fought there that day, some of whom are still struggling to understand what happened and whether they contributed to the high death toll. </p> <p>Among them is a Spetznaz soldier called Vitali, who told the Kommersant newspaper: 'There was no command to storm and we did not return fire until we knew it was the end. The Vitez Spetznaz unit went in first. We saw a terrible fire in the gym.' Another Spetznaz trooper said: 'There were a lot of children on the floor; it was full of them'. </p> <p>Even the most battle-hardened struggled to cope with what greeted their eyes. Lt Col Andrei Galageyev told Gazeta : 'When we entered the gym, I saw a 2 litre plastic bottle filled with plastic explosive and metals balls. I have been at war since 1994, but I have never seen anything like that. There were dozens of mangled bodies, some of them still burning.' </p> <p>Hosanova, whose sister and niece have yet to come home, put it differently: 'We cannot say what it is. There are no words for this.' </p> <p><b>Timeline of conflict</b></p> <p><b>1830</b></p> <p> Russian forces move into Chechnya to secure borders with Ottoman Turkey, sparking Chechen resistance. </p> <p><b>1859</b></p> <p>Chechnya fully incorporated into Russian Empire. </p> <p><b>1917-1925 </b></p> <p>Revolution and civil war lead to an attempt at creating an autonomous theocratic state.

  "The horror of the carnage and the unexpectedly high death toll in the Beslan school catastrophe were visibly etched on Vladimir Putin's face as the beleaguered Russian President toured the small town's hospital soon after dawn yesterday. <p>An official tried to say the security forces had done a good job. He was tersely brushed aside. 'As far as the special forces are concerned this is a separate story. We will talk about it later. Sadly there are many losses,' Putin snapped. </p> <p>When the siege ended, with scores of people running from the burning and shattered building, there were initial hopes that the number of victims might be relatively small. But the creeping death toll has sent a wave of shock across Russia and brought hysteria to Beslan itself. </p> <p>The crisis is the worst in Putin's presidency. It deals a massive blow to his credibility as a tough man with tough policies that can bring Russians security. It has cast new doubts on the effectiveness and professionalism of Russia's police and special forces. It has left Russians feeling more unsafe and defenceless than ever. And it has raised the spectre of unrest across the whole of the North Caucasus. </p> <p>'This is a watershed. Putin will need to improve security across the board. But he will also have to look again at all the political issues surrounding Chechnya,' Dmitri Trenin, a senior analyst at Moscow's Carnegie Centre, a leading think-tank, said yesterday. </p> <p>Like many other experts, he saw the Beslan attack as part of a co-ordinated and sophisticated offensive by Chechen fighters to take the war out of Chechnya. It began in June with an attack by dozens of fighters on several police stations in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia. </p> <p>Some wore stolen or borrowed police uniforms, which they used in order to set up road blocks, check cars, and kill unsuspecting policemen who rushed to defend their colleagues' headquarters. </p> <p>Reports that the gunmen in the Beslan operation smuggled their huge arsenal of explosives and weapons into the school while repairs were being done during the summer holidays support this version of a meticulously planned operation. </p> <p>The Chechens, aided and financed according to some Russian officials by supporters of al-Qaeda, last week used suicide bombers to blow up two civilian aircraft in midair shortly after they left Moscow. One was flying to the Black Sea resort of Sochi in what Dmitri Trenin sees as a deliberate warning to President Putin who was on holiday there at the time. 'The Chechens wanted to say they could organise their own 9/11,' he said. </p> <p>They also struck last week at a metro station in Moscow, killing eight people. But, with the apparent aim of showing that they were not stopping their operations in Chechnya even while widening the orbit to cover other parts of the Caucasus, they struck several targets in the capital Grozny a fortnight ago, killing several dozen police and Russian troops. </p> <p>The Beslan attack was the climax - at least so far. It was designed for maximum shock on the first day back to school by at least 30 men and women who must have known their chances of emerging alive were minimal. </p> <p>What can Putin do? He sees his first task as preventing the gunmen realising their aim of igniting the north Caucasus. It is less than 10 years since one of the first post-Soviet wars broke out a few miles from Beslan. Ossetians and Ingush fought over a small piece of land on the disputed border between North Ossetia and Ingushetia. Although the shooting stopped, thousands of people were displaced and the underlying issues have not been resolved. </p> <p>Reports from hostages who escaped the Beslan school on the first morning that many of the gunmen were Ingush have been censored off Russia's Kremlin-friendly television channels. Emphasis is being laid on the claim that 10 of the dead gunmen were Arabs, though it is unlikely they would have carried identity documents which could prove the Russian authorities' assertions. </p> <p>The biggest headache is Chechnya itself. Russia still has 20,000 Interior Ministry troops in Chechnya. Adjusting for the small size of the territory and the low population, this is more than twice as many troops as the United States and Britain have in Iraq. Yet the war and Russian soldiers' death toll go on unabated. </p> <p>In public Russian officials and analysts find it hard to call for a change in Mr Putin's efforts to end the war exclusively by military means. Privately, some experts call for some form of talks with a broad range of Chechens, including those linked to the independence movement. They accept that trying to build up only one or two Chechen faction and organising dubious elections to give the Kremlin's placemen a veneer of legitimacy is leading nowhere. </p> <p>The biggest decision is to start a sincere process of talks. Whether Putin will have the courage and the vision to accept the bankruptcy of his military strategy for the last five years is the main question in the aftermath of Beslan.</p>",
  "<p>Scene witnessed at a branch of Abbey, which most customers still know as Abbey National: a staff member, whose demeanour suggests she is a manager, approaches a colleague, with a document in her hand.

  "<p>Charles Dickens's Little Dorrit, the high society of 1850s London executes a smart U-turn when Mr Merdle, a banker it has grovelled before, commits suicide as his frauds are discovered. </p> <p> 'He, the uncouth object of such wide-spread adulation, the sitter at great men's feasts, the roc's egg of great ladies' assemblies, the subduer of exclusiveness, the leveller of pride, the patron of patrons, the bargain-driver with a Minister for Lordships of the Circumlocution Office, the recipient of more acknowledgement within some 10 or 15 years, at most, than had been bestowed in England upon all the peaceful public benefactors, and upon all the leaders of all the Arts and Sciences, with all their works to testify for them, during two centuries at least - he, the shining wonder, the new constellation to be followed by wise men bringing gifts ... was simply the greatest Forger and the greatest Thief that ever cheated the gallows.' </p> <p> Well, a bit strong maybe - and, of course, no criminal charges have been brought - but Conrad Black and Barbara Amiel are being damned by what passes for London society in our day. </p> <p>If the Devil had cast his net, he couldn't have hauled in a choicer catch than the crowd which used to hang around them. There were the editors of the Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph and Spectator showing a prudent respect for their owner's many opinions; there on the board of Black's Hollinger International were Henry Kissinger and Richard Perle; there at his summer parties in Kensington were Nigella Lawson and Jemima Khan, Princes Andrew and Michael, Alain de Botton and Elle Macpherson, Joan Collins and Anne Robinson - every means and manner of A-list to Z-list celebrity, until, finally, bringing up the rear, was David Blunkett, a Labour politician so enamoured of the Tory press he falls in love with its publishers. Conservative Washington embraced Black as a soulmate, while Conservative London rewarded his renunciation of his Canadian homeland with a peerage. </p> <p>Black acknowledged their homage as his due. 'The deferences and preferments that this culture bestows upon the owners of great newspapers are satisfying,' he puffed to Max Hastings, his first editor of the Daily Telegraph, in characteristic grandiloquent style. </p> <p>So they must have been. Now liberals would need bleeding hearts of stone not to burst out laughing as the deference and preferment collapses. The treachery of his friends is worthy of a Moli\u00e8re or Dickens. Where are the Boris Johnsons and the David Blunketts now that their host and benefactor is on his uppers? Amiel was a bog-standard right-wing hack who delivered harangues from whatever bully pulpits her husband owned, and it's easy to understand why few would befriend her unless they could see an advantage in making her acquaintance. </p> <p>But although it pains me to say it, Black was in a different league and wasn't a bad historian, for all his pomposity. He's now learning that when great newspapers slip from the hands of a press baron, those who appeared to venerate his every word turn out to be more concerned with the contents of his wallet than his mind. </p> <p>Nobody knows him when he's down and out, and I mean nobody. According to the Mail , his second wife is showing signs of wondering whether it's worth standing by her fourth husband. </p> <p>There never was a sillier cliche than 'loyalty is the Tory party's secret weapon' and it has never been more hilariously inapt than in the past week when the silence of Black's friends has deepened in inverse proportion to the seriousness of the allegations against him. I don't want to spoil the merriment, but the joke is as much on us as them. </p> <p>Although we don't have Dickens's Minister for Lordships of the Circumlocution Office, the state none the less gives seats for life in Parliament to tycoons whose only qualification for a place in the legislature is that they happen to own newspapers. Magnanimously, it goes on to guarantee that they never have to inconvenience themselves by standing for election. Black's disgrace won't change that. </p> <p>Nor will it change the warm greetings extended to obvious frauds in the future. In the coming months, we are likely to hear from many a freeloading celebrity and Tory politician on how they have been shocked beyond measure by the magnitude of the allegations against Black. Yet it has been obvious for years that this was on the cards. You didn't have to be able to hack into Hollinger's computers to guess that there were difficulties. </p> <p>Sensible investors on Wall Street and the City had steered clear for years. They had been burnt when Black used inside information to sell shares at the top of the market and weren't about to repeat the experience. For those with an eye for the detail, there were other warnings from his business practices in Canada and accusations brought against him by US regulators at the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission in 1982. Leaving everything else aside, Black and Amiel were living like a royal couple on the supposed salaries and dividends of a business empire which wasn't particularly large or lucrative when you looked at it closely. </p> <p>But who around them wanted to look? In My Name Is Legion, his novel set in the newspaper industry, AN Wilson has the wife of a monstrous proprietor's reflect that people don't scrutinise too closely when money is flowing and jobs are up for grabs. 'No one knew how to check details,' she concludes as she passes off a phoney account of her past. 'This was one of the first lessons Martina had learned when she made the career switch and became a journalist.' </p> <p>They're checking now. The stories last week from the inquiry by the investigators hired by what's left of Hollinger International understandably concentrated on how Black and Amiel charged the company for everything from the \u00a32 to \u00a33 million a year for an executive jet to \u00a340 for an Amiel jog ging suit (a petty swindle, if true, by the way, which offers further proof that no one is as mean as the rich). </p> <p>The overall impression was that they were engaged in a gigantic expenses fiddle. The investigators paint a darker picture. Time and again, they allege that Hollinger had become little more than a machine to enrich Black and his associates. 'Behind a constant stream of bombast regarding their accomplishments as self-described proprietors, Black and Radler [his sidekick] made it their business to line their pockets at the expense of Hollinger almost every day, in almost every way they could devise.' </p> <p>The investigators calculated that the equivalent of 92.5 per cent of Hollinger's adjusted net income from 1997 to 2002 was received by Black and Radler. Newspapers were sold, not because the sale benefited the company, but because it offered opportunities for Black and his accomplices to 'divert tens of millions in sales proceeds to themselves'.There were 'massive conflicts of interest', as Black presided over a 'kleptocracy' which 'looted' shareholders unlucky enough to be outside the magic circle. </p> <p>Hollinger's claim for $1.25 billion from Black and his fellow managers is a little more than a demand to repay expenses, to put it mildly. </p> <p>Black denies everything. But if half of what the investigators allege in their 500-page report is true, then Hollinger will join Mirror Group Newspapers, BCCI, Enron and WorldCom, and be one of those companies which weren't companies at all but criminal conspiracies. All the classic signs are there: the overbearing boss; the compliant board; and the perennially useless auditors (KPMG in this case), who are more concerned with flattering the executives who pay their fees than blowing the whistle. </p> <p>If a quarter of what the investigators allege is true, then Black may be heading for a prison sentence which will regrettably encourage really childish journalists to dig out leading articles such as the editorial in Black's Daily Telegraph of 28 December 2000 which thundered that 'Prison Works' or the one in Black's Sunday Telegraph of 5 January 1997, which denounced the Church of England's bishops for fearing 'the wrath of bien pensants more than the wrath of God' and failing to 'find the courage to oppose the fashionable intellectual opinion which regards Man as the ineluctable product of economic circumstances', a failure seen at its most craven in the church's refusal to hold criminals morally responsible for their crimes.</p>",
  "<p>And so, Prince Harry's favourite knight, Sir Clive, less than a year after winning the biggest tournament of his life, is riding off into the sunset. Well, to Southampton. The man who made England the world champions of rugby is off on the trail of a new adventure that will take him ... where? To make England the world champions of football? </p> <p>Clive Woodward probably thinks he can do it. He has already begun the process of disengaging himself from the game that gave him fame. He played rugby only reluctantly, he told us last week, force-fed the damn thing at his school, HMS Conway on Anglesey. He ran away a couple of times because he wanted to play football, football, football. </p> <p>Around 1966, say, when young cadet seaman Woodward was at his most impressionable, it was probably sexier to be Martin Peters than whoever was the creative midfield force of the Anglesey - or even the Welsh - rugby team. The names escape me. Personally, I wanted to be Nobby Stiles. </p> <p>Still, we end up doing what we end up doing. For Clive this meant not being the elegant stroker of the ball of his choice, but a centre for Leicester and England. He was graceful, sometimes electrifying, but basically nobody in the 1980s in England gave graceful centres the ball. He was more stoker Woodward than stroker Clive. It was the very reason he went into coaching, so that future generations would not have to suffer the way he had. Force-fed and then underfed. Clive truly had it tough. He'll just have to be a bit careful about divorcing rugby; he still has a bit of a job to do with the Lions next summer. </p> <p>For a time after crossing from playing to coaching in England via Manly in Australia, he was a genuine visionary. He built his back-room team - his trademark quality - by bringing in expert after expert. If Clive didn't have the answer about angles of attack, then he knew a man who did. Brian Ashton. Or, when it came to defensive patterns or forward play, the men. Or, more recently with logistics and seeing beyond the obvious, the women. </p> <p>England in the late 1990s and early 2000s played with such imagination: they were fantastic at running the legs off opponents and finishing them off with aplomb. Except when it came to winning the important games. England blew grand-slam opportunity after grand-slam opportunity in the Five, then Six Nations. They were put away by the right boot of Jannie de Beer in the World Cup of 1999. </p> <p>The answer was to spend more. The experts and expenses mounted. The playing team came together more. The Clive Experience grew and grew, putting strains on relations with the clubs and on the system at Twickenham, and even with his own players. He had to muscle out a strike threat by the national squad days before they were due to play an autumn international against Argentina. </p> <p>Woodward had a flowery vision, and had once placed a caring arm around the shoulders of Lawrence Dallaglio when his then captain was exposed as an alleged drug fiend in the News of the World, but he also had - has - a steely core. </p> <p>He is a strange blend of passionate emotion and the passionless mumbo-jumbo of management-speak. Dealing with questions about tactics and injuries before matches, he is quite happy to lie and contradict himself. But his message to his players is usually crystal-clear. And they have not always liked the message. It is a sign of a ruthlessly good manager that Woodward quickly realised that he did not need to be loved by everyone. Or at least by people who did not control the finances. </p> <p>He had a massive backer in the chief executive officer of the Rugby Football Union, Francis Baron, who protected the tracksuits from the blazers. But Baron in particular and even Woodward felt the huffing in the committee rooms. Their budget was growing at the very time when the belt elsewhere was being tightened. </p> <p>Everything depended on the World Cup. Before the trip to Australia in the autumn of last year, England finally won the elusive Grand Slam, finishing off the Six Nations in Dublin with a flourish. They then toured New Zealand and Australia and in the first half of a momentous victory over the RWC hosts-to-be in Melbourne played the finest rugby of the Woodward era: 40 minutes of sublime, total rugby. England were the champions of Europe and had just beaten the All Blacks and the Wallabies in their own backyard. They could not have been better prepared for the hurrah of last November. </p> <p>They had also peaked. During the World Cup itself, England were in gradual decline, which makes their achievement only the more memorable. An ageing pack was beginning to flag. Samoa in the pool game pulled them all over the park and made them look leaden-footed. The fluency of the three-quarters gave way to a stutter. Wales made them look pedestrian at times in the quarter final. </p> <p>But England won and won again. Woodward the visionary was now Woodward the ultimate pragmatist. If England had to win by not giving the centres the ball, then that was the way it would be. </p> <p>In the end, captain Martin Johnson dragged England to epic victory, and Jonny Wilkinson dropped them over the line. Everything about Woodward had depended on the World Cup, and he had delivered. But as some other general probably said somewhere else: 'It was a rum close thing.' </p> <p>It was so close that there was an inevitable toll. England returned home to a fanfare that was both celebratory and valedictory. The team began to fall apart. Johnson the giant retired. Jason Leonard went. Kyran Bracken and Dorian West, too. Neil Back was squeezed out. Wilkinson, Matt Dawson and Phil Vickery were injured and hardly played for the rest of the season. </p> <p>Others simply found it impossible to raise themselves for forthcoming campaigns. Will Greenwood, Ben Kay and Steve Thompson became but shadows of their World Cup selves. </p> <p>One who battled on was Dallaglio. He led England through a faltering Six Nations and took them, tripping and stumbling and finally headlong into an ungainly dive, on tour back to New Zealand and Australia. He returned and promptly declared that even he had had enough. </p> <p>It left Woodward in a strange place. Barely had the World Cup slaps on the back stopped smarting, than here he was, without a team. Wilkinson will be back and Richard Hill will presumably play until he is carted off to the Star and Garter, but the immense slab of English beef led by Johnson now has its ribs sticking out. </p> <p>Of course, Woodward had three-and-a-half years to rebuild another team for the next World Cup, and until last week was at pains to tell us that there was talent coming through by the boatload. But those words were, I think, one last fib, told without malice and without guilt. </p> <p>I suspect he has looked at the up-and-coming players across the land and worked out that the chances of England defending the World Cup successfully in 2007 in France are pretty slim. If he were given limitless time with a new incarnation, then he might stand a chance. But the prospect of slugging it out, round after round, with the clubs, to do a deal on player availability, must have been dispiriting. </p> <p>Woodward, like Johnson and Dallaglio, is going. The manager in him, the one who is part visionary and part mumbo-jumbo, said as soon as he came back from the World Cup that there was no reason why his model should not work in any sphere. Perhaps he was already turning his back on the game he purportedly never really liked, or perhaps just warning the Lions, that strange melting pot of Celts and Anglo-Saxons who do not automatically lend themselves to analysis by classic management methodology. They may have to change their ways, but Sir C may also have to fall back on rugby instincts that he may not like but which are deeply rooted. </p> <p>As for life beyond the Lions, he has a gift for identifying areas of improvement and for selling the expensive problem-solving package to the paymasters. Whether that can work in football remains to be seen. He has only the experience of loving the game, which hardly sets him apart from millions of others. Sven, let's face it, is probably not going to lose his job to Sir C tomorrow. </p> <p>On the other hand, I bet if you sat down the Swede with the English knight, you would end up with a fascinating conversation, of which at least five per cent would be intelligible to the rest of mankind. Before the pearl is delivered, a whole load of ... Southampton will soon find out for themselves. </p> <p>As for the world of English rugby that Sir C leaves behind, for a country that can call itself, and not without a mean degree of pride, world champions, things could be better. The national team is in that world of euphemism called the transitional stage, with a whole heap of countries queuing up to do what New Zealand and Australia did in June: exact merciless revenge for past deeds real and imagined. Woodward's teams were good enough at one time to give most opponents a right flogging and when it comes to England, people simply do not forget. </p> <p>It seems the national side, temporarily under Sir C's assistant, Andy Robinson, may suffer in the short, if not the medium and even long, term. Imports are still pouring into the club game. For all that they deny it and talk of development, the club owners still put immediate gratification before home-grown investment. Mind you, is football any different? If Woodward does not love rugby any more he may be about to find his journey into the sport of his schoolboy dreams just as frustrating.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Huddersfield brought their seven-match losing run to an end with a remarkable victory over a Hull side whose chances of finishing second in Super League were dealt a severe blow. Reduced to 11 men and trailing 20-10 with four minutes remaining, the Giants staged a dramatic comeback which keeps their play-off hopes alive. </p> <p>The bewildered Hull coach Shaun McRae said: 'We were absolutely dreadful. We've got a lot of young players who are not responding to the pressure at the moment, consequently that's had a effect on the whole team. I've protected these guys for most of the year but with three losses in a row I can't protect them any more. It's as poor a performance as I've ever seen by any team I've been involved with.' </p> <p>Huddersfield were unrecognisable from the poor outfit of recent weeks and their first-half defensive effort laid the foundations of what was to come. They restricted the visitors to one try by Garreth Carvell and two goals from Paul Cooke and equalled that with a fine touchdown from Marcus St Hilaire, Brandon Costin converting and then adding a penalty. </p> <p>The pair swapped penalties early in the second half before Hull took control with two tries in three minutes from Paul King and Richard Whiting, one of which Cooke converted. </p> <p>When Jim Gannon and Paul March were sent to the sin bin along with Hull's Richard Horne following a huge punch-up, that seemed to be that. Incredibly, the 11-man Giants upped their efforts and Hull crumbled, allowing Costin over for one try then James Evans for the second. Costin, who had converted the first, then booted over the second from the touchline for a stunning victory. </p> <p>Jon Sharp, the Huddersfield coach said: 'To come up with two tries in the last five minutes is an indication of how hard this team works and how tight they are as a unit. We never gave in. </p> <p>'I'm so pleased for the players and particularly the staff. I think the adversity has brought us tighter together as a group. We've had a siege mentality. We've always been positive and believed in what we've done, we knew we had a big win in us.' </p> <p> <strong> Huddersfield:</strong> Reilly; Donlan, Evans, Costin, St Hilaire; Gene, March; Gannon, Penkywicz, Fleary, Smith, Bailey, Jones. <strong> Subs used:</strong> O'Hare, Nero, Grayshon, White. </p> <p><strong> Hull:</strong> Briscoe; Best, Whiting, Yeaman, Barnett Jr; Cooke, R Horne; Dowes, Swain, King, McMenemy, McNicholas, Smith. <strong> Subs used: </strong> G Horne, Fletcher, Scruton, Carvell. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> I Smith (Oldham).</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Mauricio Ardila took his second stage victory at the Tour of Britain, winning the fourth stage after breaking away from the main field on the final climb of the day up to the finish at Celtic Manor in Newport, Wales. Taking the 10-second bonus for winning the stage, the Colombian has increased his overall lead, and is confident of being able to win the event when it finishes with a 72-kilometre circuit race around Westminster today. </p> <p>As in the previous three days, there were attacks right from the gun, including a short-lived effort by Olympic gold medallist Bradley Wiggins, but hard riding by the teams at the front prevented anyone getting too far ahead. A group of around 15 riders, including the yellow jersey-clad race leader, Ardila, eventually got clear towards the end of the first lap and went over the climb, led by Great Britain's Tom Southam, with a lead of just over 30 seconds. </p> <p>The short, sharp climb up to the finish at the Celtic Manor resort has been used to host the cycling road race national championships for the past two seasons, won on both occasions by Roger Hammond of the Belgian MrBookmaker.com squad. The Englishman was again one of the favourites although, according to Great Britain team manager, John Herety, yesterday's course was easier than that used for the championships. 'It's a pretty flat course compared to the one used then, which was very hard. The only thing that's the same is that it goes through the resort,' Herety said. </p> <p>One of the race's big-name riders, Andreas Kloeden, second to Lance Armstrong in July's Tour de France, chose the end of the first lap to climb off and quit the race, not having felt too well, according to his T-Mobile team, since the race began in Manchester on Wednesday. </p> <p>The lead group was caught on the descent, and it was soon afterwards that the day's main break, containing five riders, managed to escape, building up a lead of over a minute after 65 kilometres. </p> <p>The peloton then decided to sit up and take it easy, with none of the lead group - containing former British national champion, and Hammond's team-mate, Jeremy Hunt, the GB squad's Russell Downing, Yanto Barker of Wales, CSC's Kurt-Asle Arvesen and Koos Mourenhout - posing a threat to the overall classification. </p> <p>The lead reached a maximum of six minutes, 45 seconds after 90 kilometres, but then dropped steadily as the break's riders tired, and the sprinters' teams, including stage-three winner Tom Boonen's Quick Step squad, came to the front of the main field. </p> <p>It was all over with three kilometres left and the peloton attacked the final climb together. But Ardila used his powerful climbing skills to escape with Spain's Fernandez Moreno with Ardila taking it by half a wheel on the line. 'If it's not too hilly, I can still sprint at the top of the hills. Today I proved that,' said the Colombian. He has a 17-second advantage over second-place overall Nick Nuyens.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>The figures make no sense. Down in the Nationwide Conference South, alongside Hayes, Grays and Bognor Regis, Hornchurch are awash with cash and clearly being backed by a figure in the mould of Roman Abramovich. But no one knows who he is. </p> <p>Last season, Hornchurch attracted an average crowd of 547, with adults paying \u00a36.50 and \u00a33.50 for concessions. That is about \u00a33,000 per game at the gate, or \u00a360,000 for the league season. </p> <p>Hornchurch claim that they have not greatly increased their budget for this season, but they signed 20 players over the summer, several with Football League experience. Their manager earns more than \u00a3100,000, their players are full-time and their wage bill is estimated to be \u00a31.2million a year. </p> <p>It seems to be a winning formula: the title favourites yesterday thrashed league leaders Basingstoke 6-0, with big earners Kirk Jackson and Darren Caskey among the scorers. The crowd was 752. </p> <p>The Urchins are in talks about moving from their council-owned Hornchurch Stadium - on which they have spent a small fortune for a recent facelift - to a new home. It all adds up to a level of spending that their rivals can only dream of - but chairman Gary Calder denies the rumours that Hornchurch have had a huge cash injection from a benefactor. </p> <p>'It's a myth,' says Calder. 'There's not been that much of an increase.' He even says that the club's expenditure has not grown significantly in the past few years. </p> <p>One of the new signings, Paul McCarthy, arrived from Oxford United in the summer because Hornchurch are said to have offered him a bigger salary. Striker Jackson, another newcomer, is believed to have more than doubled his pay by dropping down from league football at Yeovil. </p> <p>New manager Garry Hill gave up his \u00a376,000-a-year job at neighbours Dagenham, who are a division higher, and dismisses suggestions that he joined Hornchurch just for the money. 'I came here because I needed a fresh challenge and that challenge is to get this club into the Conference,' he says. </p> <p>Hill also plays down the fact that the Urchins have been able to attract so many players from a higher level. 'Nowadays, lots of players go from the Football League to the Conference,' he says. 'It's like a conveyor belt. You've got to have full-time players.' </p> <p>Which is why the new ones have arrived. It might have been more than 20 had Hornchurch succeeded with a \u00a3100,000 bid for last season's Conference top scorer Daryl Clare, of champions Chester, with a wage of \u00a33,000 a week lined up. They are also believed to have made a bid for Barnet's Giuliano Grazioli for \u00a320,000 and offered him \u00a32,200 a week. Considering that the weekly wage bill at many Conference South clubs is \u00a33,000, the sums Hornchurch are splashing out are extraordinary. </p> <p>Despite the level of spending, Hornchurch reportedly made a profit last season. They would have had to because a salary cap of 65 per cent of income is in place. Their exploits in last season's FA Cup brought in television money, but not enough to pay for all those players and still make a profit. The run to the second round of the Cup would have helped to attract players, though. Last season, they knocked out Darlington before losing a controversial tie against Tranmere, whose manager Brian Little described Hornchurch as their toughest opponents during their run to the quarter-finals. </p> <p>The source of the Urchins' funding is as much of a mystery as the size of it. Two businessmen, both associated with the double-glazing company Bryco Windows, are rumoured to be chief financiers. Bryco are a subsidiary of The Carthium Group, who are developing a new sports complex in Harrow for Wealdstone FC in 2005. </p> <p>Bryco first paid for a shirt sponsorship three years ago, with the proviso that their works team could use the pitch once a month, and have stayed loyal since. One of the businessmen is Hornchurch director Brian Eagling. Sources close to the club say he arrived with \u00a310m to spend, with the aim of taking Hornchurch to the Football League. </p> <p>The other man is Carl Williams, a reclusive businessman who is widely believed to be the club's 'non-league Abramovich' and who has been known to arrive at the ground in his own helicopter. According to Calder, though, Hornchurch do not have an Abramovich-style backer. </p> <p>'There's not one person putting money in,' he says. 'Carl Williams is a fan of the club. He doesn't own it. Two off-shore companies own the club, but I'm not going down that route.' </p> <p>The start of the Hornchurch evolution can be traced to 2001-02, when they won promotion to the new Ryman Division One North after the old members' club was disbanded and a limited company was formed. The potential fan base is small because they have Dagenham and, more significantly, West Ham playing nearby. Calder's explanation for the Bryco duo's involvement is simple. 'They're fans of the club. Also, people want to get involved in a successful club,' he says. </p> <p>Hibernian assistant manager Mark Venus, a former Premiership defender with Ipswich, had spells at Hornchurch and Dagenham at the end of last season and agrees that it will be hard for Hornchurch to take fans from their rivals. 'Dagenham are more established with more history,' says Venus, who agrees with Calder that Hornchurch's spending is nothing spectacular. 'Weymouth have signed Steve Claridge and I don't think he is on peanuts. I've heard they're paying \u00a33,000 a week to a player.' </p> <p>Weymouth's ex-chairman and Observer columnist Ian Ridley confirms that Claridge is on \u00a34,000 a week but that 'he's the highest-paid player by a long way'. The difference is that Weymouth have been able to make steady improvements on gates of 1,400, whereas Hornchurch have revamped their squad with far less income. </p> <p>'I don't want to give the impression that I'm bleating, but Hornchurch are paying more than some of Millwall's FA Cup final team were getting,' Claridge says. 'I have a fantastic budget, but Gary Calder has moved the goalposts by setting aside \u00a31.2m for wages alone. Hornchurch's wage bill is unrivalled in non-league.' </p> <p>What do the league's governing body make of the situation? 'No one is registered as the official owner,' says Nationwide Conference chief executive John Moules, who is unconcerned about the involvement of offshore companies. 'It's a trend that's growing,' he says. 'We've no objections. During the past 18 months, every club in the Conference leagues has had at least one visit from the FA to check on finances and if there were any anomalies in Hornchurch, they would have picked them up.' </p> <p>Even the players seem unsure of the source of funding. 'I don't know where the money is coming from,' says Braintree assistant manager Gary Abbott, who left Hornchurch during the summer. </p> <p>Very few players turn down Hornchurch's offers. Even Dmitri Kharine, the former Chelsea and Russia goalkeeper, had a stint with the Urchins after leaving Celtic in 2002. It was a puzzling signing, but these are puzzling times at Hornchurch.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Wales returned home with a point they just about deserved from their Group Six opener after taking the lead through skipper Gary Speed and Azerbaijan equalising with a long-range Rashad Sadikhov free-kick soon after. </p> <p>Substitute Robert Earnshaw hit the post in the closing seconds, but victory for Wales on a searingly hot day when manager Mark Hughes cele brated five years in charge proved beyond them. </p> <p>'Their goal was a succession of mistakes and if we had hung on to our lead for just a little longer I believe their heads would have started to drop and we would have gone on to win,' Hughes said. </p> <p>There was a strong military presence at the Tofik Republican Stadium following fears of terrorist attacks aimed at the Azerbaijan president who was at the match. Wales played here two years ago, in a Euro 2004 qualifier, but Azerbaijan, are a much improved side since then under the leadership of Carlos Alberto. </p> <p>Wales started brightly with Speed heading a Hartson cross powerfully into the arms of goalkeeper Dmitry Kramarenko. The home side responded with a couple of long-range efforts but none that troubled Paul Jones and Wales calmed the initial flurry of attacks. </p> <p>Azerbaijan continued to press and Jones was relieved to see a shot from Anatoliy Ponomarev fired inches over. With 30 minutes gone, Wales had managed precious little up front, but one neat ball from John Hartson looked to have set up Mark Pembridge on the edge of the box, but he was shut down. Minutes later Pembridge's long throw evaded the defence and fell for Hartson at the far post, but his fierce drive was blocked. Encouraged, Wales began to knock the ball around more confidently after the home side had threatened to take control. </p> <p>Pembridge, who took a knock in the first half, was replaced by John Oster for the second, Jason Koumas switching to the left. The change brought immediate dividends as Wales took the lead. </p> <p>A great run by Danny Gabbidon opened up the play for Koumas to lift a fine cross in from the flank. Hartson rose to nod the ball down into space for Speed to run in and volley home from six yards. </p> <p>But Wales's lead was short-lived when Robert Page was penalised for a foul on Ponomarev 30 yards out. When Sadikhov launched the free-kick it flew through the Welsh wall like a missile. Jones dived and got his hands to the ball, but could not stop it going in. </p> <p>It served as a wake-up call to Azerbaijan, with Ponomarev and Gurna Gurbanov causing real problems for the Wales backline. Wales found they were pushed further back and reduced to hitting the home side on the break. </p> <p>With six minutes remaining, Ponomarev was replaced by Iigar Gurbanov, the third of the set of brothers to be used.

  "<p>That advert for the Premiership's sponsors about there being 60 million football managers in Britain - the 59.999m unemployed being added to this week by the main figure in the commercial, Sir Bobby Robson - has it about right. Everyone thinks they could do it. </p> <p>It is why fantasy football competitions have taken off. Buying and selling, picking and choosing, tactics and formations - we are all experts. Having seen what is involved at first hand, however, even at non-league level - all the phone calls, scouting trips, training sessions, the agonies of matches themselves, the sheer 24/7 thinking about it - I am convinced it is better not to compromise any self-awarded reputation as an expert by actually doing the job. </p> <p>It is why Sir Clive Woodward is at the least very brave. He already has visions of trading the post as England's rugby guru for the arsenic cup of nation's football manager. </p> <p>He will find a role within football, most likely at Southampton, where the chairman Rupert Lowe appears to want to recruit Woodward for his motivational, man-management and sports science skills. </p> <p>Others have moved sports with some success, among them Bill Beswick, once England's basketball coach, who became Middlesbrough FC's assistant manager with main responsibility for sports psychology. It is an example of how English football has gradually become more open-minded, certainly since the advent of the Premiership. Reluctant as it has been to change, results elsewhere in the world, both at international and club level, meant that dragging and screaming could no longer be avoided. </p> <p>In came Johnny Foreigner player, with his insistence on training, eating and preparing professionally, even abstaining from the drink. Then came the overseas career coach, schooled in diet and nutrition, physiology and psychology. The words athlete and conditioning buzzed. </p> <p>All sorts of stories, some apocryphal, emerged about Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's methods at Arsenal. Training sessions were conducted by the stopwatch, with, say, 10 minutes of stretching followed by six minutes of running followed by two of walking, and rarely lasted more than 45 minutes. </p> <p>Before each season, he would send players to a dentist in Paris, to check their jaws were properly aligned, the theory being there would be no knock-on misalignment of the body that could cause injury. The dietary supplement Creatine was introduced to increase stamina. All fitness programmes were designed to bring the team to a physical peak from March to May. </p> <p>In addition, at half-time of games, players would be given a sugar lump to put under their tongues as soon as they arrived in the dressing room. It served two purposes: one, to stop players arguing with each other in the heat of the moment; two, to provide instant energy. Five minutes before the end of half-time, they would be given caffeine tablets for new impetus. </p> <p>Injured players would be sent for specialist rehab in the south of France with a favoured conditioning coach. From France, a doctor was brought in to administer vitamin supplements - also used by Wenger-disciple Glenn Hoddle when England manager, the needles involved provoking disquiet in Sir Alex Ferguson - and a chiropractor to help with players' flexibility. </p> <p>To house it all, Wenger insisted on a new training centre with the most modern facilities possible. He even took to arriving first to ensure the heating was set at the optimum level. G\u00e9rard Houllier followed suit by helping design Liverpool's new Melwood facility. He had a curved locker room built so that there were no corners for players to hide in, so that camaraderie was enhanced. </p> <p>Other clubs have caught up. Manchester United and Manchester City have spanking new sites and methods brought from abroad, copied in this country, are more widespread. The best managers and coaches have moved with the times. </p> <p>There still can be a suspicion of the scientific. Football is a game of passion and spontaneity; it can never work out entirely as Wenger plans. His record suggests more often than not, however, though he has yet to crack Europe, where similar methods abound. </p> <p>It is, for him, all about percentages. A player can be 85 per cent fit or at 65 per cent of his capacity. The running statistics from matches will tell him. The computerised video system that tracks players also analyses performance. </p> <p>Woodward has been used to all this and more. He studied other sports, such as American football, to see what can be taken from them. Many football managers have also studied the sport, as well as basketball, or at least their luminaries such as Vince Lombardi and Phil Jackson, to glean as much useful philosophy as possible. </p> <p>The knee-jerk reaction is to dismiss Woodward's presumption. He will first need to overcome the doubts of sceptical pros, though at least he can show them his medal. What can he know about football, apart from watching Chelsea? He went to a rugby-playing school didn't he? Apart from relating to the frustration he felt about that, I do feel there might be something in this, however. </p> <p>In addition to his technical skills, Woodward established a code of conduct with the England rugby team designed to promote team spirit and mutual and self-respect. Newcastle, for example, could do with some of that right now. He empowered the best players to perform at their best by creating the right atmosphere and preparation. </p> <p>That would seem to transcend sports. These days, as many top coaches observe in any sport, including the most enlightened in football, it is about draining an extra percentage point out of a team, given that so many teams are so well matched at the top level. </p> <p>When Woodward does make the move into football, he deserves to be given a chance for his courage in stepping out of the pigeonholing process that all creative people have to endure. But this is not a soap star taking up singing. This is about one of the country's finest sporting brains, and the tacky old world of football could well end up being grateful for a bit of quality thinking, on and off the pitch.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It is a blessing of sorts for Berti Vogts that football form can be as unreliable as it is in most other forms of professional sporting competition. Otherwise, sports editors would already be preparing to put a black border around reports of Scotland's opening World Cup qualifying match against Slovenia at Hampden Park on Wednesday. </p> <p>The German's admission in Valencia last week that Slovenia are a much better side than Hungary should have been enough, on the basis of logical correlation, to cause a national shudder. It is, after all, a mere three weeks since the Hungarians embarrassed Scotland in a 3-0 victory in a friendly in Glasgow. </p> <p>In a perverse way, however, there is encouragement to be drawn from Vogts's recognition, finally, of inadequacy among the bulk of the players at his disposal. After two-and-a-half years of ludicrous claims of being in charge of a squad 'full of quality', the coach seemed to acknowledge that thorough and disciplined organisation would be the most feasible method by which Scotland might avoid calamity in a qualifying group that also includes Italy, Norway, Belarus and Moldova. </p> <p>Yet it had remained a source of disquiet that Vogts, having seemingly made a sound diagnosis, had, until a performance full of promise in the abandoned 1-1 draw against Spain last Friday, shown no signs of being able to effect a cure. </p> <p>'Because of the number of younger players we have, there is still too much naivety,' said Vogts before the game in Valencia. 'We allow opponents to run at us and cause damage. Look at Hungary's second goal at Hampden, when their left-back [Sabolcs Huszti] carried the ball forty yards before shooting it into our net. </p> <p>'One of the most noticeable things at the European Championship in Portugal was how top-class players don't allow that to happen. The great players are happy to concede a free-kick in these situations, as long as it is far enough out, not in a threatening position. </p> <p>'Every team needs a Neil Lennon to do the kind of breaking-up job he does so well for Celtic. I think Lennon's team-mate, Jackie McNamara, could do it for us, but I probably need three Jackies - one for right-back, one for left-back and one for defending in midfield. </p> <p> 'I've spoken to Darren Fletcher about this and reminded him of how Ryan Giggs, a great forward for so many years, tracks back to stop opponents when it is necessary. It can't always be attack, attack, attack.' </p> <p>If Vogts has seen only relentless aggression in the Scots in recent times, he must have been looking at a different team from the rest of us. Apart from a 5-1 beating of Trinidad and Tobago in a friendly at Easter Road in May, Scotland's most distressing weakness has been a consistent lack of menace in forward areas. </p> <p>Even against Spain, when McNamara was part of a solid midfield and defence that also featured sound contributions from Barry Ferguson and Malky Mackay, the striking flaw was once again evident when Stevie Crawford squandered two golden opportunities to give the Scots a hardly credible 3-0 lead by half-time. </p> <p>Vogts's analysis of his problems betrayed his failure to manage them. The argument that many of his players are too young dissolves in a comparison with the Hungarians, whose average age was lower than that of Scotland. </p> <p>Worryingly, Vogts appears to be placing his faith on the ill-founded notion that the Scots are, as if by some arcane sorcery, transformed from kittens to wildcats in competitive matches. He supports his theory with the statistic that, in five competitive home matches in Euro 2004 qualifiers, four were won and the other drawn. </p> <p>These included the wholly unconvincing 2-1, 3-1 and 1-0 victories over Iceland, the Faroes and Lithuania respectively. But his certainty about success in the forthcoming programme is not diluted even by his acknowledgement that the opponents in the World Cup campaign are much more formidable than those in the European series. </p> <p>'I am looking at the campaign as a whole and I am very confident,' he said. 'Our failure to get to Portugal was not due to taking only one point from Germany, but to losing in Lithuania and drawing in the Faroes. That's why I want nine points from our opening three matches.' </p> <p>Since this threesome comprises Slovenia and Norway at Hampden (both of whom made the Euro 2004 play-offs from more difficult groups than the one in which the Scots participated) and Moldova away, the coach's confidence is curious. The performance in Valencia was at least encouraging, but there is no reason yet to go tub-thumping.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "It was good to see the Prime Minister hit the ground running on his first week back from holiday as he set about tackling the problem of unruly behaviour among sections of the nation's youth. <p>Throughout the country people see anti-social behaviour as a blight on their communities and Tony Blair is right to address people's worries. </p> <p>But I know that Anti Social Behaviour Orders (Asbos) are not the answer. The most high-profile element of the Asbos: allowing youngsters to have their name and photo emblazoned across the posters and local papers for minor offences, could well do more harm than good. They call it 'name and shame' but, believe me, the Asbo is more likely to be seen as 'name and fame' to the aspiring lout. </p> <p>Why am I so sure? I am speak from experience as an accomplished student of the school of juvenile delinquency. From there I graduated easily to the college of criminality and a number of custodial sentences. So I know what I'm talking about. I look at each new crime initiative with interest wondering if it would have worked for me. This one would not have deterred me at all. </p> <p>Had the Asbo concept been around at the time I was offending, I would have undoubtedly wanted to earn one to show off to my friends, just as most children enjoy displaying their better-than-expected GCSE results. </p> <p>My equally anti-social associates - green with envy- would have given me a pat on the back for my accomplishment before setting off for a bit of skulduggery themselves, in a bid to match or better my achievement. </p> <p>I have no doubt that for many young people aspiring to a life of crime, the Asbo has become another rite of passage towards adult imprisonment along with police cautions, and time at a secure unit or a young offenders' institutions. </p> <p>Sadly, it may give chil dren who have trouble fitting in a way of winning the admiration of their peers. The poor or scruffy or daft child has always been a target for bullies, but not if he or she can be naughtier, not if they can be 'named and famed'. </p> <p>I know the Asbo is a civil measure - that the criminal offence only happens after an Asbo is breached. We won't be branding these young people as criminals, just anti-social. But I know from personal experience that once you are labelled you become resentful. And resentment can be quickly followed by defiance and misplaced pride. </p> <p>As in other areas of life, you are only as good as your last accomplishment, so in order to get the accolades of your peers, you must continue to produce the goods. Once on that road, it's easy to get lost, as I found to my bitter cost </p> <p>In my experience the only boys in my crowd who would have been deterred by an Asbo are those who would go home to a savage beating at the hands of a bullying parent. </p> <p>I don't have the answer, but I know the Asbo quick fix will not work. My own turning point came when someone pointed out that other kids from a background similar to mine - the sort currently on the Asbo hit list - might be looking to me as some sort of role model. Until then, I'd had a lifetime of being named and shamed and told publicly and privately just how bad I was. </p> <p>By that time I was in my mid-twenties and serving a seven-year sentence at Wormwood Scrubs. Someone had the inspired idea to get me working at a special unit there with disruptive children - exactly the sort of young people who now receive Asbos. </p> <p>I was in a better position than any authority figure to tell them what really lay ahead for them, without labelling them 'anti-social' or anything else. And it made me feel I was doing something positive for the first time in my life. That unit has now, tragically, closed down because it was judged too expensive. </p> <p>My chance came because I happened to be in one of the few places within the penal system where instead of dehumanising you, they treated and spoke to inmates as fellow men. </p> <p>Finally, someone had made an effort to treat me like a fellow human being. I started acting like one.</p>",
  "Not in a million years would I have anticipated I would end up going to Cambridge University: I'm a working-class boy from Bradford, and Cambridge and Oxford have got a sort of mystical status. I had no idea that they were open to ordinary people. <p>When my sixth-form college suggested I apply to Cambridge, I just shrugged it off. I never thought of myself as particularly intelligent and certainly wouldn't have put myself forward as someone who would even think of applying but the college kept on at me. They took me to open days and I was even put in touch with an undergraduate at Cambridge, who made the life there seem far less daunting. Gradually I began to gain enough confidence to give it a go. </p> <p>Surprisingly there's no animosity from my friends in Bradford over my plans. People could have said I had got too good for them and I'm relieved that hasn't happened: everyone has been really supportive. </p> <p>I am quite an insecure person generally and there are a couple of things I'm worried about in particular. I'm not concerned about being ostracised for being from a state school background, but I am afraid I might not meet people I can make friends with because we won't have much in common. </p> <p>The thing I am most worried about is that the course will be very difficult and that money will be an issue. The university doesn't allow undergraduates to work during term time which will cause me a few problems but if I work hard every holiday, I should be able to build up some savings. My dad has also said he will help me but I don't know to what extent he can really do that. </p> <p>I've accepted that I'm going to get in debt but hopefully in the long run, my degree will mean I can pay it off. </p> <p>Going to Cambridge will do more for me as a person than anything else: to know that a normal, working class person can get into Cambridge has increased my confidence no end. I've never been given anything that opens doors to this extent: this is an opportunity that will transform the rest of my life. </p> <p><b>Hopes</b></p> <p>Make friends and feel at home in Cambridge; get a grasp of the course; come home to a nice big Christmas dinner and keep in close touch with friends at home; join a club or society that lets me be myself.</p>",
  "<p>You can tell a lot about a man and his work from his office desk. Take a look at Patrick Grayson's minimalist set-up at his new firm, GPW, and, apart from the usual phone and pen-holder, your eyes will fall on the following: a pair of powerful-looking brass binoculars; a letter opener in the form of a lethally pointed hunting knife; and a hand grenade. </p> <p>'If this had gone off when it was supposed to, we wouldn't be talking today,' says Grayson, and passes over the heavy and brutal-looking (but now harmless) weapon. He explains how, while he was an Irish Guards officer in Aden in the early Sixties, the grenade was thrown at his jeep, landed by his feet - and failed to explode. 'I was lucky. Others weren't so lucky in Aden.' </p> <p>At 60, Grayson does not look or sound like his CV suggests: Sandhurst, Guards, tobacco executive, arms salesman, 'private military services' provider, corporate investigator. His manner reminds me, at least, more of his Catholic education - he would suit a soutane and biretta - with a large strain of City gent. </p> <p>It is a package that must impress potential clients - the big investment banks, corporations and law firms that he hopes will provide his bread and butter at GPW. The company was launched last week with a flurry of publicity about Grayson, its chairman, and his two partners, Andrew Wordsworth and Peter Pender-Cudlip. </p> <p>The aim is to fill a niche in the corporate investigations market, below the big global firms like Kroll Associates (more of whom later), Control Risks and Risk Advisory group, but focusing on the 'pure' investigative business rather than getting diverted into security and private military services. </p> <p>'There are people out there making squillions of dollars out of Iraq, but we don't want to do that kind of thing. We want to get back to basics. I suppose if we had a corporate motto it would be \"pure intelligence\". I rather like that,' says Grayson. Grayson learnt his 'pure intelligence' from the master of the art, Jules Kroll, the legendary founder of the eponymous firm that made the corporate investigations business respectable. 'I owe everything to Jules,' says Grayson. 'In fact, the whole industry owes everything to him.' </p> <p>His modesty does him credit, but when the two men met in 1986, Kroll must have known he was getting a seasoned professional who had already succeeded in four careers, and who was looking for his next challenge. Grayson had just finished some work on behalf of the families of Kuwaiti hijack victims who felt the airlines had failed in their duty to protect passengers, and Kroll was impressed by his work. 'I think he was quite taken with this Englishman who seemed to know his way round the world,' says Grayson. </p> <p>That is where the CV comes in, and it is no surprise that Kroll was impressed by a track record that wouldn't look out of place in an Ian Fleming novel. </p> <p>The son of a ship owner turned Army officer, the young Grayson travelled a lot as a child, and after boarding at Downside he went straight into Sandhurst, and from there to the Irish Guards. </p> <p>He caught the tail end of the British empire in Kenya ('I helped to haul the flag down in 1963') and then to Aden, where the British were fighting against Yemeni tribesman as well as urban insurgents. After his close call with the grenade, he learnt fluent Arabic, which was put to good use later. </p> <p>From the Middle East, he was posted to Hong Kong, where the British were eyeball to eyeball with the People's Army at the height of the Chinese cultural revolution. 'It was really tense. We thought the Chinese would invade any day, and dead bodies would come floating down the rivers on the border at night time,' he recalls. </p> <p>Then he was sent back to the UK for general training, but realised, in his mid-thirties, with a wife and three children, and 14 years in the army behind him, that it was 'commit or quit'. He decided on the latter, and doesn't seem to regret passing over a senior military career with 'all those boring generals'. </p> <p>He found a job via a personal contact as a marketing executive with Imperial Tobacco, which in those days was branching out overseas. 'I was a smoker, but knew little else about it. I learnt all about branding on the job, and enjoyed it, but in the end I got a moral issue about marketing the stuff to young people all over the world, so I quit and joined Heckler &amp; Koch.' </p> <p>As he relates this, Grayson stops for a second to see if I've spotted the gaping irony involved in having moral qualms about selling cigarettes, but none at all about selling H&amp;K's deadly weapons. </p> <p>'Well, I suppose I stopped being a hypocrite, at least,' he says. 'Soldiers have guns, and somebody has to manufacture them.' The job with the German company came his way 'via an old friend in the SAS' as he was strolling around London the day of the Iranian embassy siege in 1980. 'I had military experience and marketing skills, so it seemed quite natural to sell equipment to people like the Bahraini anti-terrorist units.' The Arabic must have been a job-clincher. </p> <p>The next scene sounds like a Fleming plotline. 'I was at home one Sunday when there was knock on the door and there were these three Kleinwort Benson bankers who I knew - they had military backgrounds. They wanted to invest in the private military sector, and thought I could start something up for them.' The result was Defence Systems Limited, which specialised in providing security guards for foreign, especially American, embassies in the Middle East and later became DSL. </p> <p>Even then, in the mid-Eighties, diplomats in the region were feeling increasingly vulnerable, but could not use their own troops outside the embassy com pounds. 'We hit on the perfect solution - we used former Gurkhas as security guards, unarmed, outside the grounds, and they had such a fearsome reputation that it worked,' says Grayson. It was the success of DSL that brought him to the attention of Kroll. </p> <p>'Jules called me and asked me to New York, all paid, to meet him, so I said why not? We met in his office on Third Avenue, and he offered me a job. When I told him I already had one, he said: \"I'll fix that\".' From the prepossessing Kroll, who had just been headlined 'Wall Street's private eye' by the New York Times , this amounted to an offer Grayson couldn't refuse, and was the beginning of his eight-year role as head of Kroll in Europe. </p> <p>This was the City after Big Bang, the revolution that changed the face of the Square Mile. 'It was exhilarating stuff. The old-boy network was weakening because of all the foreign banks coming in, but we still met some resistance. Some of the old school would tell us they got all the intelligence they needed in Whites club, but we got over that.' </p> <p>Kroll, and Grayson, played a major part in some of the epic corporate confrontations of the era, and had some of the biggest business names as clients or opponents - Goldsmith, Hanson, ICI, BTR, Minorco. Perhaps his biggest career achievement as an investigator came when he led the Kroll team that tracked down the foreign assets of Saddam Hussein after the Gulf war in 1991. </p> <p>The fees rolled in, and Grayson left 'on good terms' in 1994 to set up on his own as an adviser to the investigations business. 'I've been the \"honest broker\" in the sector,' he says. </p> <p>He accepts, though, that honesty has not always been traditionally associated with the investigations business. Dirty tricks, phone-tapping, even searching through rubbish bins, have sometimes been the modus operandi for the corporate gumshoes. 'I spend as much time telling people what I don't and won't do as much as what I will, and we try to err on the side of caution,' he says. </p> <p>'But there is some information that falls within the realm of legitimate investigation. If the chief executive is drinking a bottle of scotch a day, it affects the business. If he's having an affair outside of work, it probably won't, but if he's having an affair with his secretary, it might. And surveillance, though risky, is sometimes legitimate. The morality is genuinely vague,' he explains. </p> <p>Some modern investigators believe, in this information-rich world, that the best sources are the publicly available ones, and Grayson agrees there is much to be gained from the internet and other hi-tech sources. 'But in the end you've also got to use up the shoe leather and accumulate knowledge. All the surveillance in the world will not replace knowledge and experience.' </p> <p>With his partners in GPW, Grayson is back on the beat in the Square Mile.</p>",
  "<p>There are stories that are so bonkers they are best told straight. Lidl, the German discount retailer with UK stores, ordered its Czech female workers to wear arm bands during menstruation (there's no nice way of putting that). According to an August edition of German trade retail magazine Lebensmittelzeitung, local managers decided it was the only way to be sure that women were not taking unnecessary loo breaks. Women with an arm band could go as often as they liked, instead of waiting for the official breaks. Lidl declined to comment on reports that the policy had been piloted in Poland, or indeed to comment at all when Lebensmittelzeitung asked for a response. Calls to the UK HQ in Livingstone, Scotland, met with an interminable recorded message which explains that it is impossible to talk to a human being. The German magazine said the policy has been quietly axed, noting the uproar in the Czech press and bemoaning the effect on Czech-German relations. Was it an example of the famous German Gr\u00fcndlichkeit (thoroughness), it asked. No one on Cheapside is qualified to answer. </p> <p><strong>Suits you, sir</strong></p> <p> Those no-nonsense northern folk at Matalan celebrating improving sales are keeping their feet on the ground.

'If I don't wear it, how can I expect the customers to?' Quite. There's more, though. 'It's made in an Armani factory and has it more wool in it than the one M&amp;S sells for \u00a3135.' Can it be so? Well, not quite. 'We don't sell a suit for \u00a3135,' says a spokeswoman. 'Perhaps he means the \u00a3129 suit? We won a Queen's Award for that one for technical innovation.'

Cartledge's new work, Alexander The Great: Hunt for a New Past, examines whether Alexander was a military genius or a drunken homosexual. The answer, as any fule kno, is 'both'.

  "The crew of a Dutch abortion ship say they will continue their efforts to enter Portuguese territorial waters despite a week-long stand-off with two naval vessels dispatched by Lisbon. <p>The Borndiep, which has a clinic on board, has been trying all week to dock in Figueira da Foz in northern Portugal as part of a campaign to challenge the Catholic country's stringent abortion laws. </p> <p>The Portuguese government says it will continue to ban the ship, even though its owners, Dutch pro-abortion campaigners Women On Waves, say they will not break any laws while in Portuguese waters. </p> <p>Group spokeswoman Michelle Voogd said the Borndiep was running out of fuel 15 miles out to sea. 'We have asked for special permission to bring the ship in for refuelling, but the port authorities say they have received no answer from the government. </p> <p>'If the silence continues, the ship will go to Vigo in Spain to refuel and return after two days.' </p> <p>Supporters are taking food and water to the ship's six-strong crew in rubber dinghies. </p> <p>'The Borndiep has twice challenged the corvette and the smaller naval vessel by attempting to enter port. Each time, the ships block them. We do not know what will happen if we try a third time,' she said from Figueira da Foz where she, three medical staff and campaign supporters are waiting for the Borndiep to dock. </p> <p>The Dutch group, which in 2001 and 2003 landed successfully in Ireland and Poland, does not have Dutch permission to carry out clinical abortions on board. However, it can distribute abortion pills, called RU486 or mifepristone, in international waters. </p> <p>Portuguese law allows pregnancies to be terminated only where a woman's life is in danger, when her physical or mental health are threatened, there is a congenital danger of malformation of the foetus, or in the case of victims of rape. </p> <p>The Secretary of state for Maritime Affairs, Nuno Fernandes Thomaz, said that the ban on the Borndiep was 'a question of legality not morality'. The right-wing minister added: 'If we accept that outsiders break our laws, it will get more difficult to impose the law on our nationals.' </p> <p>Pro-abortion campaigners say that up to 40,000 illegal terminations are carried out in Portugal every year, with about 5,000 women ending up in hospital due to complications. Others travel to Spain for operations. Women found guilty of having an abortion face up to three years in jail. Anyone caught performing the operation faces up to eight years. </p> <p>Most recent surveys show that Portuguese people are in favour of legislation being softened. In 1998, a referendum endorsed that trend, but the 32 per cent turnout was not enough for the result to be legally binding.

  "<p>After reading the Daily Mail 's serialisation of a new biography of Dirk Bogarde, I was profoundly disappointed. One of our greatest film actors, discreetly gay, fond of women, emerges as vicious and cruel. Yes, Bogarde had a waspish side, but was he really a misogynist who routinely reduced women to body parts? </p> <p>The author of the biography, John Coldstream, was disappointed, too. Far from being a straight serialisation, Coldstream claims the extracts were 'adapted' from his book without any authorial balance. </p> <p>'Two days before the first episode was to run, we were confronted by this travesty,' he explains. 'My book is a serious attempt to come up with a rounded portrait of Dirk. What the Mail did was send the book off to some hack who cherry-picked everything that would result in Dirk appearing unfavourable, in particular in his relationships with women. The rewriting is totally crude and hostile. Quite why they had it in for Dirk so much I don't know. It seems to be a combination of homophobia and misogyny.' </p> <p>There's nothing new about these literary spats. Authors often feel misrepresented after selling serial rights. Sub-editors tend to add salacious headlines and cheesy 'sells' along the lines of: 'Tomorrow, dear readers, I'll be telling you all about my sex change, the day the BBC blew up and my wife left me.' </p> <p>As the authorised biographer, Coldstream had the trust of the actor's inner circle, who are understandably devastated. But as a former literary editor of the Telegraph, what made him choose the Mail ? Surely he knew how newspapers cut and paste? 'It was a very good opportunity to reach a slightly different constituency from Dirk's usual constituency. And there's something to be said for having \"difficult forces\" inside the tent with you rather than outside.' </p> <p>When Coldstream realised the paper's intentions, he tried to stop the articles, but the Mail ran them regardless (under the winning headline 'Dirk the Deceiver'), simply removing his byline. Which brings us to the thorny issue of literary serialisation. Obviously, authors and publishers need to recover their investment, but can you really ever control your own story? Yes, the Mail offers top dollar, but recent serialisations of Michael Buerk and Ian Holm have looked pretty grubby. Buerk's well-written autobiography was reduced to stories of journalists shagging in the studio, while Holm, a fine actor, emerged as a sex-addicted windbag . </p> <p>In the old days, serialisation was a gentleman's activity. Broadsheets reserved the front pages for The Crossman Diaries or the letters of Evelyn Waugh. The treatment was weighty, academic. According to Robert McCrum, literary editor of this paper: 'It was part of the proposition a serious Sunday paper offered to its readers. Now that world's gone completely. Readers don't subscribe any more; they go to the supermarket and pick up whichever paper takes their fancy. What's required on a Saturday or a Sunday paper is more grabby.' </p> <p>But does mass serialisation result in high book sales? Don't readers feel they have already read the best bits? 'Obviously, there are some big, complex books that you can serialise a lot from,' says McCrum, 'but with others, by the time you've run the good bits, there's nothing left. What really sells books these days is radio. Being on Start the Week is far more powerful. I think the great days of print serialisation are over.' </p> <p>Famously, Robin Cook and Edwina Currie commanded huge advances for serialisations, only to see their autobiographies remaindered in Books etc. Face it, chaps, you're supping with the devil. Make it a long spoon.</p>",
  "<p>I have never been completely clear in my mind on the subject of my sexuality. Often labelled a 'closet queen' by gay and straight alike, usually in jest, I submit to this false image for the sake of peace and quiet. These jibes come from two quarters - homophobes who have no clue about the gay psyche, and then, rather surprisingly but equally irritating, militant gay men who are deluded in their notion that the world is in a high state of homosexual denial. All such contradictions and conflicts came home to me last year when I was in Palm Springs, staying in Liberace's mother's house during Pride Weekend in November. </p> <p>My daughter Kate and I - she, like me, is a filmmaker - were making a documentary commissioned by the BBC: an intimate account of a year in the life of two Englishmen called Andrew and Jeremy Get Married . During that year I converted to the view that to deny two men or two women the same legal rights afforded a heterosexual married or co-habiting couple is to deny homosexuals a social privilege as crucial as any of their other fundamental human rights. </p> <p>Palm Springs is the sprawling desert community made famous by the Hollywood Rat Pack of the 1950s. Its population is now almost 50 per cent homosexual, and the area almost rivals San Francisco in its status as the gay capital of Bush's homophobic America. </p> <p>I'd made a deliberate decision to have a woman working with me. Kate, 26, provided balance in what at times could be an uncomfortably male dominated environment. During the Pride Weekend she was the only woman in a house of 14 gay men - and me. One night, after Kate had gone to bed, I found myself being schmoozed by a drunken and proudly gay Texan. Only yards away, my daughter was being kept awake by his persistent seduction attempts. Only when I proclaimed emphatically that I didn't like sex with men did he accept defeat. He gripped my face, kissed me symbolically on the lips and flounced off to his lover's bed. I collapsed in laughter, as did Kate who had been suppressing her mirth throughout the whole embarrassing interlude. She then explained, to my astonished protestations, that over the months of filming many gay men had said they found me sexually attractive. Did I mind that I had been sexual prey for this or any other man? Not one jot. I was flattered. </p> <p>I had met Andrew and Jeremy at a summer dinner party thrown by the novelist and screenwriter Hanif Kureishi. They were sitting silently and apart in Hanif's garden. Andy, who is tall, bronzed and well proportioned, was nervous and awkward - it turned out that this evening had been in the diary for months but he had been reluctant to be exposed to what he thought was an elite group of London's literati. Jeremy - small, professorial, with a greying beard - was much more relaxed. There was no indication at first that these two wildly different men even knew each other. Andy told me he had met Jeremy in an Earl's Court gay bar and that they had been lovers for five years. My level of curiosity increased: not because they were gay but because they seemed such an unlikely, albeit engaging, combination. What I learnt that evening was enough to persuade me to spend a year following their stories. Why? </p> <p>Apart from having a perfect opportunity to show two homosexual lovers living their lives outside any of the camp stereotypes which abound in the media, there were other tempting reasons. Jeremy provided me with an opportunity to lay a personal ghost. I was raped and abused by my French master when I was 12. When I wrote about this in The Observer, I nursed a fear that I had been too harsh on my predator. Jeremy told me he had been a schoolmaster in a private boys' school and had lived through the same era of sexual repression that was typical for homosexuals in the 1950s, when I was at boarding school. He explained that he, like 99.9 percent of gay men, would never have dreamt of abusing his professional position. </p> <p>Andrew also presented me with another strong issue to grapple with which had personal resonance. Both his parents died without knowing their son was gay. I too had hidden my boyhood homosexual experiences from my family and parents for 35 years. Why were we both so unnecessarily secretive? </p> <p>Andrew was born on a council estate in Lee, south London - a fiercely homophobic environment. The youngest of three, he was brought up believing that one day he would 'meet a girl, court, then get married and have 2.4 children'. Meanwhile he took part in queer-bashing sessions with local thugs. 'I realised that if they had known, it would have been me getting that kicking.' For years he tried to make relationships work with women but found himself constantly eyeing up men. Sex with women was always disappointing. On leaving school Andrew drove buses for London Transport for nine years. Meanwhile he discovered the cruising scene, which led to dozens of unsatisfactory, emotionally frustrating one-night stands. He quit his job - he now had an alcohol problem which made it dangerous to drive, and was experimenting with heroin. Unemployed and living on benefits, he financed his habit by stealing from his mother. Finally he was jailed for dealing. </p> <p>He joined a rehabilitation programme in jail and managed to curb his addiction enough to survive a serious attack of hepatitis. Somehow, too, he managed to stay clear of HIV. </p> <p>Jeremy came from a very different world - a privileged colonial background similar to my own. His father was a major in the Indian Army and Jeremy was sent away to a boarding school in Sussex. His first full sexual encounter came when he was at Cambridge in the Fifties. During that era homosexuality was a criminal offence and Jeremy risked jail. Disturbed psychologically by his sexual predilections, he secretly sought out psychiatric help. He was advised to 'take a cold shower' and 'just get married and it will go away'. One shrink recommended electric shock treatment. In desperation Jeremy married the beautiful sister of the man he had most desired at Cambridge. Their marriage, consummated in Afghanistan where he had a job working as Shell's only representative on the northwest frontier, was a disaster. Predictably they divorced. When he finally returned to England to a teaching career, he resorted to placing adverts in magazines seeking sexual partners. </p> <p>It was the Sixties now, and men such as Tom Driberg, Ronnie Kray, Lord Boothby and Quentin Crisp were the celebrities of the gay world. Although it was still illegal, homosexuality was beginning to become acceptable. Finally the Wolfenden report paved the way towards a momentous change in the law. Jeremy was free to have as many lovers as he wanted. </p> <p>On 1 May this year, in Norman Foster's magnificent City Hall which overlooks the river and Tower Bridge, Andrew Thomas, 48, a retired bus driver 'married' Jeremy Trafford, 68, a retired teacher. Andrew's two sisters pitched up with their families, including Andrew's nephew, who is gay. A group of Jeremy's bohemian friends came. The chairman of London Gay Writers read from the Old Testament; an opera singer friend sang 'Can't Help Loving That Man of Mine'. Andy insisted on his favourite love song: 'When I Closed My Eyes'. And they exchanged vows and rings. </p> <p>For Kate and I, these powerful, moving public gestures were the crowning moments in our year of filming them. It was also a fitting layman's challenge to the Church of England's inexplicable reluctance to accommodate homosexual marriages. I had been as moved by Andrew and Jeremy's non-religious vows as I had been at a friend's grand Church of England wedding in a Chelsea church the previous Saturday. Ironically, from a statistical standpoint, the heterosexual marriage had less chance of a happy ending. </p> <p>Every week on the top floor of City Hall, the Mayor of London has been sanctioning Britain's most public official platform for men to marry men and women to marry women. These commitment ceremonies, as they are called, are almost a celebration of marriage. A registrar attends, and every couple's public commitment is entered in the London Partnership Registry. There are many other venues for ceremonies like these but only Mayor Ken Livingstone has had the courage to make available - for a small fee - his administrative headquarters to these moving rituals which challenge and defy those who believe that marriage can only exist between a man and a woman. </p> <p>In San Francisco the mayor took his powers a step further and gave the same status as conventional heterosexual marriage to same-sex weddings in his City Hall. But the Californian legislature has now overturned his decision, and 'gay marriages' have lost their legal legitimacy in the one state most likely to accommodate them. </p> <p>In the last few months several states have passed laws making the very concept of same-sex marriage illegal. Among westernised Christian societies, the United States is not the only reactionary country. Last month in B\u00e8gles, south-west France, the mayor was accused of breaking the law when he sanctioned the first gay wedding in France. The marriage has since been declared 'null and void' by Dominique Perben, France's Justice Minister. </p> <p>Here in London, ceremonies like the one Andrew and Jeremy went through can be recorded in the London Partnership Registry. This quasi-formal union has no formal legal status but is a halfway house until the bill going through Parliament later this year hopefully gives homosexual couples similar legal rights to those enjoyed by all co-habiting heterosexual couples within or outside marriage. That would end the situation whereby the bereaved partner of a gay relationship is denied unchallengeable claim to their lover's pension rights. Nor would the state be able to refuse a man his right to live in Britain with his male partner free from the fear of deportation - just because he cannot exercise the same rights to become a citizen which a foreign woman can exercise if she legitimately marries a British man. Who knows, we might even see a gay royal wedding, one day. Perhaps Andrew and Jeremy will be invited. </p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong> Andrew and Jeremy Get Married debuts at the Toronto Film Festival on 10 and 12 September.</p>",

But it hasn't generally been a good setting for movies, with nothing between Anna Neagle in Nell Gwyn (1934) and the screen version of Rose Tremain's Restoration (1995) to match the power of Howard Barker's 1983 play, Victory, a powerful political study of the period. </p> <p>One would have liked to see Richard Eyre make a movie of Victory that had a similar political bite to his first and best feature film, the anti-Thatcher state-of-the-nation piece, The Ploughman's Lunch. Sadly, he's chosen to direct <strong> Stage Beauty</strong>, adapted by American author Jeffrey Hatcher from his own play, which by the author's own admission attempted to do for the theatre of Charles II's time what Shakespeare in Love did for the Elizabethan stage. </p> <p>Most of the characters are based on real people. Billy Crudup plays bisexual actor Ned Kynaston, famous for playing female roles in the company run by Thomas Betterton (Tom Wilkinson), generally regarded as the greatest actor of his day. While Ned is the toast of London as Desdemona, his dresser Maria (Claire Danes) is breaking laws and conventions through clandestine appearances in the same role. </p> <p>Then Ned affronts influential folk at court, especially Nell Gwyn, who's played by Zo\u00eb Tapper the way Barbara Windsor would perform in Carry On Restoring . So she gives Charles (a camp Rupert Everett) an especially sumptuous blow job to persuade him to ban men from playing women's roles. This sends Ned's career into free fall and in the manner of A Star Is Born or All About Eve, the dresser takes over and becomes a great actress. </p> <p>Up to this point, the mode is comic, if never particularly amusing, dealing in anachronism with the subtlety of The Flintstones . Then the film starts to get serious, not to say solemn, as Ned and Maria get up close and personal, talking about gender, sexual identity and the art of acting. It's Tootsie with a periwig and without the jokes. He coaches her as Desdemona and within 48 hours they're ready to shock London with a natu ralistic performance of Othello that anticipates the RSC and National Theatre of the latter part of the 20th century and makes Donald Wolfit resemble David Garrick. </p> <p>Heavy handed and adolescently bawdy, it's more like something run up by drama students as part of a graduation show than a serious comedy about changing theatrical styles like Pinero's Trelawny of the 'Wells'. </p> <p>For 80-odd years, westerns have been reinterpreting for successive generations the stories of Davy Crockett and the Alamo, Custer and the Little Big Horn, Billy the Kid and the Lincoln County war, Jesse James and the Northfield bank raid, Wild Bill Hickok and Deadwood, Wyatt Earp and Tombstone. All but one have been glorified and vilified in a way that reflects the temper of changing times. The exception is Crockett and the Alamo, where 250 Texans perished in 1836 defying General Santa Ana's 4,000-strong Mexican army. The place is more than a tourist attraction, it's a shrine, and the battle cry 'Remember the Alamo' has echoed down the years at moments of national crisis. </p> <p>John Wayne's epic treatment of the subject, with himself as a massively heroic Crockett, was a strident right-wing intervention in the Cold War back in 1960, relishing the word 'republic' and saying 'Better Tex than Mex' but meaning 'Better Red than Dead'. Though clearly a post-9/11 movie, John Lee Hancock's <strong> The Alamo</strong> is more ambiguous than revisionist and steers a wary line between triumphalism and iconoclasm. </p> <p>In the roles played by Wayne, Richard Widmark, Lawrence Harvey and Richard Boone, the new film has low-key, unheroic actors - Billy Bob Thornton (Crockett), Jason Patric (Jim Bowie), Patrick Wilson (garrison commander William Travis) and Dennis Quaid (General Sam Houston, first President of Texas). </p> <p>They are not men self-evidently keeping a rendezvous with destiny. Crockett, having lost his seat in the Senate, has come to Texas to get a patch of ground. He isn't expecting to fight and only stays because he's a prisoner of his own myth. Bowie is dying of consumption and is at the Alamo to reclaim its artillery for Houston. The politically ambitious Travis unexpectedly finds himself in command and has difficulty asserting his authority. </p> <p>But they rise to the occasion and both the siege of the Alamo and the battle of San Jacinto, in which the Mexicans were routed the following year, are handled in a grave fashion, as if the makers were afraid of appearing to be glorifying war. </p> <p>Few bones are made about the commercial, expansionist aims of the Texan leaders and while bickering goes on at the Alamo, an observer on the fringe, speaking in Spanish, describes the future martyrs as 'lowlifes' and opines: 'Santa Ana only wants to rule Mexico; these people want to rule the whole world.' But Santa Ana is presented, not inaccurately, as a military leader of great arrogance and a preening monster, with contempt for the lives of his men whom he employs like suicide bombers. </p> <p>The film's thrust is that this is a war that should not have been fought, but having engaged with a monstrous enemy, it must be carried on, however reluctantly. This is the way it reflects the times and it's a decent, rather half-hearted liberal affair designed to appeal neither to hawks nor doves. </p> <p>Adapted from a comic book and directed by the talented Mexican horror-movie specialist Guillermo del Toro, <strong> Hellboy</strong> is a tolerable mixture of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Alien and Men in Black. The spawn of the devil surfaces through the jaws of hell, is adopted by the British head of the American government's secret Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence (John Hurt), and helps save the world from a reincarnated Rasputin. There's much violence, some humour, relatively little gore. </p> <p><strong> Festival Express </strong> is a brief, bright documentary using old and new footage, tracing a journey by private train from Toronto to Vancouver that a group of rock musicians made in 1970, jamming together and giving concerts along the way. The performers, including Janis Joplin (who died that year) and the Grateful Dead, come out of it well. Their audiences, who demand free entertainment as their right, don't. </p> <p>In Ferzan Ozpetek's likeable <strong> Facing Window</strong>, a working-class couple take in an elderly, middle-class amnesiac (one-time heart-throb Massimo Girotti) they meet walking the streets of Rome and find themselves involved in a twisting story that leads back to a Nazi pogrom in the Second World War. As with the same director's other pictures, bourgeois marriage is brought into question and homosexuality viewed in a warmly sentimental light. </p> <p>Very briefly. <strong> You're My Hero</strong> deals touchingly with teenage life in Seville following the death of Franco in 1975. <strong> In Casablanca Angels Don't Fly</strong>, the feature debut of a Moroccan director trained in Italy, is the predictable but none the less moving story of three Berbers from impoverished mountain villages seeing their dreams turn to dust while trying to earn a living in the big city. </p> <p>Set in a dreary Austrian town, <strong> Free Radicals</strong> is a well-made ensemble piece along the lines of Altman's Short Cuts and Anderson's Magnolia , in which the paths of numerous people cross over the course of a year. We and they wonder whether we live in a world of order or chaos, or perhaps a combination of both. </p> <p><strong> The Perfect Husband</strong> is a Bombay movie in English about the problems various rich upper-class families in Chandigarh experience in marrying off their children. One of the worst Indian films I've ever seen, it ends with the dedication 'To the daughters and daughters-in-law of India'.

  "<p><strong>The Terminal</strong> <br>(125 mins, 12A) <br>Directed by Steven Spielberg; starring Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci</p> <p>A few years ago Richard E Grant appeared in Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life, a brilliant comedy short that merged Capra and Kafka. Steven Spielberg's new film, The Terminal, which is intermittently funny and very long, might well have been called Frank Capra's The Trial. Tom Hanks, America's likeable Mr Everyman, becomes the acceptable face of the alien 'other', Viktor Navorski, a sad citizen of the fictional eastern European state of Krakhozia. When a war breaks out back home while he's in transit, Viktor has his return ticket and passport impounded and becomes trapped in the international travel lounge of New York's Kennedy airport because he can't be given a visa to enter the States and is unable to return. </p> <p>It's a familiar subject, touched on with some seriousness in, for example, Casablanca and in Mitchell Leisen's Hold Back the Dawn (co-scripted by Billy Wilder) where Charles Boyer was a would-be immigrant stuck in a Mexican border town before the Second World War. Some years ago the role of Viktor would have gone to Peter Sellers or Peter Ustinov. It is important (and a canny decision by Spielberg) in these troubled times that the part is played by someone as sympathetic as Hanks, a gifted comedian who can manage guile but hasn't a streak of nastiness in him. </p> <p>From the start, Viktor plays a game of bureaucratic cat-and-mouse with the sad by-the-book Customs and Border Protection official, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci, in customarily excellent unsympathetic form), who's hoping after 17 years' dedicated service to become overall boss of airport security. Dixon treats Viktor with icy contempt as a temporary problem to be left in the lounge for a day or so with a few meal vouchers. When he appears to turn into a permanent resident, Dixon tries first to pass him over to other departments, then to facilitate his escape. But after sad blunderings, and always remaining appealingly vul nerable, Viktor starts to control his sorry situation. He sets up house in a disused wing of the airport, starts learning English and makes a few cents collecting unreturned luggage trolleys. When Dixon frustrates this source of income, he drifts into casual work with builders where his skills as an artisan bring him more an hour than Dixon himself earns. Eventually he can afford a Hugo Boss suit (part of the film's relentless product placement) in which to court a beautiful air hostess (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whose confidence in human goodness he's helping to restore. </p> <p>A good deal of this is ingenious and funny. But the movie is heading steadily into Capraesque sentimentality as Viktor becomes the close friend of an elderly Indian cleaner, a Hispanic kitchen worker (for whom he acts as Cupid with a customs clerk) and a black baggage attendant. Climactically he becomes the hero of not only the exploited, multi-ethnic employees of the terminal shops, but also of the immigration staff (Dixon excepted of course). It also turns out that Viktor had not come to the States for social or economic advantage but to honour his late father by executing a symbolic act of filial piety that can be seen as highly flattering to American culture. </p> <p>Those who loathe everything about airport terminals (the mirrored surfaces, the neon lighting, the muzak, the hideous acoustics, the perpetual queues, the lifeless throngs, the announcements, the exclusivity of private lounges) will find this movie oppressive in the way the makers probably intended. The brilliant set, the work of production designer Alex McDowell, is like a flashy annexe of hell, and the film's length gives Viktor's plight a sense of eternity, or at least of time suspended. The compassion, however, is, if not exactly false, too thin to bear the crushing weight of the sentimentality.</p>",

Even the local chief inspector of police said it gave a 'wholly false impression' of the town. </p> <p>More than a million viewers watched the BBC2 documentary, Campbeltown, last Tuesday night. It followed the lives of disillusioned teenagers Donald, Casie, Jessica and Katie in what was billed as an intimate portrait of small-town life. </p> <p>During the 50-minute film, London-based director Paddy Wivell showed the teenagers drinking and yearning to move to Glasgow, with one of them saying: 'It's a shite-hole. If I hate my children, I'll send them to Campbeltown Grammar School.' </p> <p>Casie, a clearly vulnerable 19-year-old, revealed that she'd been raped at 14 and had been getting 'blinding drunk' after her relationship with a 38-year-old man fell apart. Unemployed, she informed viewers - including potential employers - that she would prefer bar work because 'you can have loads of sneaky wee halves'. </p> <p>Donald was shown stealing drink from a friend's house while his parents were on holiday, urinating in the street and complaining that he could get married at 16 but had to wait two years before he could legally buy porn. </p> <p>Campbeltown, described in the programme as the nearest place to nowhere and the furthest from anywhere, has had its share of knocks in the past few years. Its shipyard lies redundant. Big employers, such as Jaeger and the RAF base at Machrihanish, have packed up. And, most crucially for a town which depends largely on tourism, the ferry which once guaranteed a stream of visitors from Ireland no longer runs. </p> <p>Civic leaders insist the town is on the brink of an economic revival. A multi-million-pound sports complex is due for completion next year and there are signs a new ferry operator could be in the pipeline. </p> <p>Residents, however, fear the town and the four youngsters featured in the documentary may suffer irreparable damage in its wake. </p> <p>Sitting on the palm tree-lined promenade enjoying the warmth of the early evening sun, George McMillan, a former provost of the town, said the entire place was furious. </p> <p>'I've never seen the people of Campbeltown so livid,' he added. 'They picked four youngsters, the likes of whom you would find in any town or city in Britain, and tried to pass off their views as definitive evidence that this town is like hell on earth. </p> <p>'They showed nothing positive. There are loads of activities for young people here. It is an idyllic place to live. It is incalculable the amount of revenue that will be lost because of it.' </p> <p>Smith's main concern, however, is about the repercussions on the teenagers who took part. </p> <p>'I don't blame them one bit,' she said. 'The film-maker, who had better never show his face here again, exploited vulnerable young people. What is the point of showing a boy urinating in the street other than to humiliate him?' </p> <p>Residents have also accused Wivell of being economical with the truth. One scene showed a group of scantily-clad youngsters hanging around outside Woolworth's: what viewers weren't told was that they were on their way to a school disco. In another, crowds of teenagers were seen drinking and camping on the beach: again, viewers weren't informed that it was to celebrate the end of their exams. The film also portrayed Donald as a no-hoper when, during filming, the school pipe band he played with won the world championship. </p> <p>David Mortimer, creative head of factual entertainment with the BBC, insisted the documentary gave a fair portrayal. 'There is absolutely no question of it being exploitative,' he said. 'It's an author piece so necessarily it's one person's view. Paddy spent a long time with the young people who featured and their friends. He certainly didn't go to their community with any preconceptions or any agenda beyond being interested in what it's like growing up in an isolated community. We were scrupulously careful to present the reality of what Paddy found and I think it was a fair, accurate and balanced piece.' </p> <p>Back in Campbeltown, the community has been debating how to deal with the aftermath of the coverage. Some have written to the BBC demanding a public apology, while a youth group has already started shooting Campbeltown: The Real Story, which it will be urging the BBC to transmit. </p> <p>Meanwhile, those who featured in the film have mixed views. One of the four, who didn't want to be named, fearing reprisals, said the community was 'in denial'. </p> <p>But Jessica, now 17 and studying in Glasgow, said she was horrified. 'They made it look like a terrible place and it's not.'</p>",

  "<p>There is a protocol to interviews like this one. The rule is that the subject must always confide that they were the odd one out at school, the local geek, the misfit. Keira Knightley was teased for being a late reader; people ran away from Erin O'Connor screaming in fright; and when Jamie Oliver walked into class, everyone chanted, 'Special needs!' Apparently. But when TV's property Miss Moneypenny Kirstie Allsopp says, 'I was the weird one at school,' I know she was right; I was there.</p> <p>Kirstie wore velvet hairbands and kilts and Puffa bodywarmers, when everyone else wore ripped jeans and DMs and grandad overcoats. She had framed pictures of domestic pets on her bedside locker, liked mum music (Elkie Brookes, Neil Diamond), dropped nobby names with abandon, and possessed the sort of ringing RP that meant Pony Club and Sloane Square and shooting in Scotland. She was pure rah, an entirely different sort of posh from the craven, glottal-stopping norm, with our Smiths tapes and Indian throws and patchouli joss sticks from Camden Market. The thing was, Kirstie simply couldn't morph. In a sea of fakers and canny survivalists, she was unable to dissemble. She was who she was (just as, on telly today, co-presenting a rather authoritative property show, she is entirely herself: a slightly revved-up, camper version for sure, but still authentically Kirstie). It's obvious in retrospect how splendid an achievement that was. It demonstrates a confidence of identity that few 15-year-olds possess. But at the time, a group of us danced around her in the dormitory, singing Hall and Oates' 'Rich Girl', while Kirstie went red with fury and indignation and, oh Lord, a sort of agonised pleasure, because she was always, always hungry for attention.</p> <p>It's not usual to begin an interview with an apology, but this one has to. Kirstie, 31, dismisses it with a cheerful snort. She has long since made her peace with a fairly miserable adolescence. 'It just happened that I wasn't good at schools. That's why I went to so many. I just struggled. Mum said she saw it when I was little, she says I had little stunted social antennae from birth. Out of some children's heads spring these social antennae, with state-of-the-art bells and whistles. Well, one of my social antennae was deformed, and the other was stunted. I grew them. But it was a struggle.'</p> <p>There's another pin-sharp impression I have of teenage Kirstie, and that's of her gallumphing attempts to get on socially. She was always a trier - the nicest maths report she ever got said, 'It's such a pity Kirstie won't pass her GCSE because she really has worked hard,' - and when it came to making friends, she was precision-guided. This transparent ambition enraged people more than anything else, but you sensed she didn't even know she was doing it. She liked pretty things; she wanted to be friends with the pretty girls. 'Mum said it was agonising: at every new school, she'd see me make a beeline for the coolest kid in the class, absolutely determined to be that person's best friend, come hell or high water.'</p> <p>She has always been a dog-type person, full-throttle, heart-on-sleeve: apparently unembarrassable. So she crashed that precocious clique with all the subtlety of a wrecking ball. There was some resistance, and I was forever coming across Kirstie in corridors and on stairwells, in noisy torrents of tears because she'd been cut out of a breakfast date (any normal mortal would have lain low, hoping such a slight wouldn't become public knowledge). But Kirstie's best friends are still those girls: framed photographs of them are scattered throughout her flat. Only the other day, one of them told her the only reason they're all still in touch is because Kirstie is so good at organising get-togethers, and 'I nearly cried. I felt that was such a cool thing. That means I've grown my antennae.'</p> <p>Her flat is in a quiet street in North Kensington - just the sort of street she'd pick out for a punter on her house-hunting show Location, Location, Location, since it is equidistant to both chichi and scuzzy neighbourhoods - is also decorated exactly as you would expect. It's a million miles from minimalism, packed with chintz, stripes, good oils, bead-and-butt woodwork in pearly blues and creams, corduroy sofas, snapshots of people in evening dress and cushions so excessively plumped, in that rah tradition, that they are practically spherical. A one-bed country pile in west London, it is rather definitely not groovy. 'Ladylike' is the word that springs to mind, though its owner, who had friends over last night and so is repeatedly hijacked by a succession of yawns and burps, does her best to undermine that impression.</p> <p>Kirstie's dad is Lord Hindlip, the former chairman of Christie's, a dashing auctioneer who roared with laughter when Ali G asked him why Van Gogh cut off his penis, and shouted, 'Sock it to 'em!' when a black velvet Catherine Walker dress raced past its $50,000 estimate during the 1994 sale of Diana's wardrobe. Her mother, Fiona, is an interior designer, a cat type who believed 'rather sweetly, that it was the other kids who were out of step, and if she found the right school, there'd be other kids who would be, like me - special. It's a thing all parents feel, you expect your child to be recognised as, basically, dazzling. So she waited for that to happen to me, and it didn't.'</p> <p>Kirstie left Bedales, where I knew her, after GCSEs. She studied for A levels in a desultory fashion, while working part time answering the phones in an estate agency. That was when she started to feel happy about herself. 'As soon as I was in a working environment, with grown-ups, I was being judged by how hard I worked, and how well I did. The practical was suddenly a good thing, and I have semi-domestic talents, I suppose.'</p> <p>A variety of the usual premarital Sloaney pasttimes kept her busy for the next few years. When she was 19, she got a job with the flamboyant interior designer Nicky Haslam, which paid 50 quid a week. 'Complete baptism of fire. He'd lost his licence, so I was driving him all over the place, getting involved in one decorating disaster after another.' On one occasion, the lilac silk tenting they had prepared for the VIP dining room at London Fashion Week was condemned by the fire officer an hour before the lunch was due to start.</p> <p>Then she went to work at Country Living magazine. She was an editorial junior on nine-and-a-half grand, and in many respects it was like a sort of finishing school with lunch money. Not only did her dyslexia put a damper on any advancement up the masthead, but, worse, much worse, there were no men. Everyone menstruated in synch. She didn't have a boyfriend the entire time she was there. The statistic that 40 per cent of people meet their partner through work haunted her throughout her time at the magazine. At school, she had never turned up for any of her careers advice sessions. What was the point? She was going to leave school at 16 and get married, and 'everyone knew that. I really didn't need a career. So at Country Living I was just biding my time, waiting for him to turn up. And he didn't.'</p> <p>It was around this time that I last bumped into her. It was late autumn and Kirstie was planning, with one of her girlfriends, to launch a service buying Christmas presents on behalf of cash-rich, time-poor execs: a sort of proto-concierge company. When I mention this, she shrieks with pleasure. 'Oh yes! I'd forgotten! That's so cool! I always credit myself as not having any ambition, but I did, I did, I was really mad keen on that idea. I always used to think that I'd be good at being a highpowered PA. It's that thing of making people's lives easier, seeing a need and sorting it for them. I never minded the thought of being a dogsbody.' In the end, though, she chickened out and - having bought a flat with parental assistance - joined a history of art course at Christie's, mainly in the hope of finally collaring the future father of her four children. (Her dad was still running the auction house at the time: did she get funny looks from the staff? 'No, because my mother and my brother had both done the course,' she says, innocently.) Christie's turned out to be good for her confidence. At 21, she realised that she wasn't quite as idiotic as everyone had thought: by osmosis, she had picked up a grounding in art and architecture.</p> <p>The next box to be ticked on her Sloaney checklist was supposed to be an interior design business but then fate - or former New Labour spin doctor Derek Draper - intervened. A friend of a friend, he asked her to find him a flat, and soon loads of Westminster and media types were ringing up, asking for help in tracking down the right property. There was a namecheck in the Guardian, in the Telegraph, then Channel 4 asked her to do a screen test with an ex-marine called Phil Spencer. Kirstie always had a certain charisma, but now she had something to add to that: competence.</p> <p>She says the screen Kirstie - who is now something of a dykon thanks to her bossiness, her spike heels, her 'luscious dark hair' - is pretty close to the real thing, 'just more domineering. I don't fake it, I don't think it's a different me, it's just a bigger me.' The show is now in its eighth series, and its presenters are in professional partnership offscreen as well as on, charging clients of Garrington Home Finders a minimum fee of six grand.</p> <p>The temptation to make life a bit simpler by just concentrating on the telly work is not an option. 'I am neurotic about the fact that telly is transient and borderline demented,' she says. 'Property is my security blanket. If you don't have a day job, or at the very least a job you can go back to, you are setting yourself up for a terrible fall.' And in any case, though her assurance in front of the camera has now grown to the point where she's experiencing 'a bit of a transition ... I could probably do anything, as long as it wasn't stupid,' the last few weeks have shown her the risks involved in heightening her profile, after several tabloids suggested that she had been involved in breaking up the marriage of a schoolfriend.</p> <p>Though reluctant to talk about it, she's seething about the way the press twisted the story of her relationship with Ben Andersen, a property developer. Before all this blew up, she had a rather sunny view of her position in the entertainment firmament, believing that because she and Phil were property finders rather than TV stars - because they never went to film premieres or to parties given by people who were not friends of theirs - the tabloids wouldn't bother with them. 'It turns out I was completely wrong about that. There is no difference, no deal. You are fair game. I feel so stupid. I've been so naive. And to be honest, if I had any ambition to further my career in telly, it might have been knocked on the head by that. It has brought me up sharp.'</p> <p>She has been thinking about something I said earlier on. 'You know you said that at school I probably wanted attention?' she asks. She admits there's an element of truth to that. She has always been gregarious, noisy, in need of reassurance. But just recently she has realised that some sorts of attention she can do without.</p> <p>It's not true that she and Ben were seeing each other before he and his wife Theresa, another Bedalian, separated in January. 'I'm incapable of having an affair with someone else's husband. I'm sure I'd stab my own grandmother to get certain things, but that's not one of them.' In fact, it was Theresa who introduced them for the first time, at an April fundraiser for Orlando Fraser, the Tory prospective parliamentary candidate for North Devon. Kirstie had gone along to the event at London's Bush Bar and Grill with an ex, half-hoping they might get back together, and was talking to Theresa when Ben turned up. They danced and he rang her later with an invitation to dinner, and she said yes. It wasn't a big deal to Theresa: in fact, when she next saw Kirstie, she said, 'By the way, I think Ben quite fancies you.'</p> <p>Uncharacteristically cautious when the topic is raised, Kirstie will say 'Theresa's totally OK with it. But she's furious about the story. For Tree [Theresa] to be painted as the victim is ridiculous. It's completely scummy.'</p> <p>A few weeks ago, she'd have jumped at a recent overture from Simply Come Dancing, because she likes the idea of competition, and glittery frocks and learning something new. Now, if the production team turns out to be serious, she's pretty sure she won't do it. But before you well up in sympathy, it's worth bearing in mind that she has let me in; a photographer from the Mirror is piling up his equipment in the hall and there's a long list of promotional obligations attached to the publication of How To Buy A House, a guide she has co-written with Phil. In truth, though it's packed with snaps of Kirstie and Phil having a coffee at a pavement cafe, and Phil and Kirstie peering in estate agents' windows, and Kirstie and Phil looking serious in the snow, it also has some useful tips in there that might just make the whole business a little less painful (though, personally, I have a bit of a problem with the idea of buying an ingratiating cappuccino for the agent before a morning viewing).</p> <p>Kirstie takes the hobby that turned into her calling card very seriously indeed: she has fervent opinions on stamp duty, the extension to the congestion charge, property tax inconsistencies, asbestos-removal legislation and the new housing bill (which she pronounces as useless as a chocolate teapot). And if she brandishes these opinions a bit, banging on crossly until, sinking deeper into her cord sofa, I find myself mentally checking out and inspecting the books on her shelves (lots of Dominick Dunne, Kitty Kelley and, of course, Jilly Cooper), who can really blame her? These opinions demonstrate that she is more than a telly personality in heels and a wasp-waisted red coat; they also - as she points out herself - make her feel better about the fact that she never took her A levels that seriously. It's one of her big regrets. The other? 'I wish,' says Kirstie, 'I wish I'd realised years ago that everyone feels the same way. Everyone feels left out, insecure, scared. There are a few people who are more resilient, but they are the weird, strange, left-out ones: the ones who are so tough that they never worry what anyone thinks.' It's the sort of thing that people do tend to say in interviews, but coming from Kirstie, it has the ring of absolute truth.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> How To Buy A House is published on 9 September by Michael Joseph, priced \u00a312.99</p>",
  "For a government pledged to be 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime', its latest initiative appears to have backfired spectacularly. <p>Plans to strengthen the Neighbourhood Watch Association have sparked a revolt among Britain's army of curtain-twitchers, whose vigilance helps protect six million homes. Senior members of the association's national body, which represents 165,000 local co-ordinators, have accused the government of secretly plotting against it.</p> <p>Now relations between the two sides have reached their nadir with Neighbourhood Watch members privately accusing Home Secretary David Blunkett of trying to obtain access to the organisation's database in preparation for taking control. </p> <p>'I think the government is trying to hijack the Neighbourhood Watch movement's national body. It was set up by co-ordinators to preserve the movement's independence and the government is doing its damndest to get rid of it,' said Pam Wass, manager of Neighbourhood Watch in Wrexham. </p> <p>Amid a mounting furore in the shires, 117 MPs have signed an early day motion calling for a debate, while a number of local associations have broken away from the parent body, expressing fears about its future direction. </p> <p>The government, in turn, has started legal action against the national association and ruled out further funding. 'I feel like we have been jammed into a corner with a gun pointing to our head,' said John Howell, director-general of the national association. </p> <p>A sponsorship deal with a bank was scuppered at the eleventh hour after the government started legal proceedings to recover the association's logo, which had been registered as a trademark two years ago. </p> <p>In a further sign that bodes ill for the national association, Home Office minister Hazel Blears recently announced plans to introduce a national Neighbourhood Watch forum, which will work in partnership with other agencies, charities and local groups to co-ordinate a crackdown on crime. </p> <p>Sandra Calvert, co-ordinator for Devon and Cornwall, said: 'The government says it's not trying to destroy the organisation, but it has a funny way of showing it.' </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said the national organisation had failed to cut costs, and claimed the body did not represent the interests of all Neighbourhood Watch associations. 'One of the reasons we are taking legal action against them is because they have stopped some associations from using the Neighbourhood Watch logo. Any attempt to own the logo is a breach of crown copyright,' the spokesman said. </p> <p>The spokesman denied the government was trying to dismantle the Neighbourhood Watch network, but admitted it wanted to see a stronger leadership role. </p> <p>But Howell warned: 'Neighbourhood Watch members may not be the sort of people who will march down Whitehall, but gradually they will lose confidence and they will walk away.'</p>",
  "For the street children of the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, escape comes in two ways. The first is by way of a solvent-based glue called Resistol which they inhale to induce a four-hour long high. <p>But there is a more final exit that the street children dread - murder at the hands of the city's so-called 'death cars' and dumped in skips, dustbins and ditches. </p> <p>It is not just the street children, who beg and sell their bodies on the streets of Honduras, who are victims. Other youths too are victims of a social cleansing that is sanctioned by a large proportion of the country's society. </p> <p>They are Honduras's tattooed gang members with affiliations to the Los Angeles gangland. They are the number one enemy of the country's literate classes, denounced by politicians and in the media, and exterminated by police and private death squads. </p> <p>Some 700 children have died in the last two years, according to Amnesty International which has been running a campaign against child murder in Honduras. </p> <p>And some of these killings have been on a large scale. The latest took place on 17 May when 105 prisoners, largely young gang members with the Mara Salvatrucha gang, were locked into the El Porvenir prison in the textile-producing city of San Pedro Sula and burned alive. </p> <p>It follows a similar mass killing at La Ceiba in northern Honduras last year when 51 members of the 18th Street gang were summarily shot, and their wing set on fire. </p> <p>But while it has been the prison fires that have drawn the most attention, it is the constant attrition against the country's youth that is still alarming Amnesty. </p> <p>Darwin Roberto Sacuceda Flores dreamed of becoming a doctor and was good at school, but that all changed when he joined the 18th Street gang at the age of 14. Two years later he was dead. </p> <p>Sara Sacuceda Flores believes the police executed her son. 'Darwin met a girl from the 18th Street gang at a party,' Sara, 39, remembers. 'The gang was a new world. They promised clothes, shoes, gold chains and the chance to be a leader, a boss. </p> <p>'But it was all a lie. When you start, the gang gives you a better identity, but when you try to get out you can't. He had \"18\" tattooed on his chin, and his arms were full of tattoos. He took cocaine and alcohol, and they robbed to get what they needed.' </p> <p>Darwin got into frequent trouble with the police and went to prison several times. He was arrested for the last time on 14 February 2002 and released two days later. He frightened his mother with gloomy premonitions. 'He said he would die soon, that the police would kill him.' </p> <p>He died the next day. 'The police let him go, but then they came back and killed him,' Sara said. 'There are witnesses, but they are afraid to speak out. The police are blaming the killing on the gang, but it's not true. </p> <p>'Our government is repressive and they let the police act with impunity. There is no rehabilitation, they just arrest our kids and throw them into prison and they come out more aggressive. The courts in our country don't treat their deaths seriously because these are kids with social problems.' </p> <p>The assault on Honduras's street children and gang members is part of the country's mano duro (strong hand) policies, inspired by the zero tolerance approach of New York in the Nineties. </p> <p>Those policies were introduced by President Ricardo Maduro, who has converted zero tolerance into an anti-gang campaign that has stigmatised every youth with a tattoo and resulted in widespread human rights abuses. </p> <p>And while children in poverty-stricken Honduras are responsible for criminality, it is a tiny proportion of the problem ascribed to gang members. Their activities, however, have been inflated and compared with a terrorist assault on the state. </p> <p>According to Amnesty International's 2003 report on Honduras, a 1999 study undertaken by the Honduran Institute for Children and the Family noted that only 0.02 per cent of all murders committed in Honduras were attributable to minors. The Honduran government itself has accepted that juvenile delinquency accounts for only around 5 per cent of the country's crimes. </p> <p>Against this background Amnesty launched its latest report on child killings in Honduras last week. It acknowledges that Honduras's Special Unit for the Investigation of Violent Deaths of Children has made some progress, but since its creation has looked at only 400 of more than 2,300 killings of children since January 1998. Only 88 cases were forwarded to the Attorney General's Office, and just three have resulted in a conviction. </p> <p>Although the government has admitted police have been involved in many of the killings, only two officers have so far been convicted. </p> <p>'Thousands of children in Honduras face a similar fate to Darwin,' said Kate Allen, UK director of Amnesty International. 'The Honduran authorities must prevent and punish killings of children and youths in the country, and protect witnesses. </p> <p>'The government should appoint ad hoc judges to work specifically on these cases. The future of the country depends on it.'</p>",

I had to pay another \u00a3500.<br><strong>EA, Bristol</strong> </p> <p>KLM insists it is the passenger's responsibility to know the rules, and that it was complying with Kenya's conditions and information in the International Air Transport Association manual. </p> <p>The Kenyan High Commission says it requires a passport to be valid for at least three months from the date of entry to be allowed into the country. But the Foreign Office checked and is adamant the time limit is six months. So, even if you knew this was an issue, finding the correct answer is difficult. KLM will not budge or show any compassion. </p> <p><strong> Still recovering from insurance</strong> </p> <p> NatWest home insurance said we owed \u00a327.30 after we cancelled our policy last November.

  "<p>There's more than the language barrier to worry about when venturing overseas to build or restore your own casa, g\u00eete or palazzo.</p> <p> Obtaining planning permission, finding a good builder and keeping tabs on progress are all bound to be tricky in an unfamiliar country. But Channel 4's Grand Designs Abroad, which starts this week, highlights some more unexpected difficulties - ranging from duplicitous surveyors to intolerance of vegetarians.</p> <p> 'Of the [European] countries featured in the series, Italy and France seem to be the toughest places to build,' says Helen Simpson. 'Spain was one of the easiest. Building in Italy is a nightmare. It's so bureaucratic - getting planning permission is very difficult.' One couple featured in the series, restoring a 1,000-year-old castle in Tuscany, were unexpectedly ordered to stop work by local officials. It transpired that their geometra - a bit like a surveyor - had falsified the building permissions to start work by forging signatures on official documents.</p> <p> Another couple rebuilding a derelict olive farm in Puglia had to use a bizarre retrospective planning law, leaving them the uneasy task of applying for planning permission after the work had been done. Other potential self-builders never made it on to the show, because they could not obtain planning permission or find suitable workers locally.</p> <p> In one episode in the Lot d\u00e9partement in France, self-builders Mark and Debbie Sampson discovered some unexpected cultural differences. Though their unusual straw bale house was eventually accepted by the locals, no one invited them for dinner because they are vegetarian. Debbie's occupation as an alternative therapist did not go down well either. Says Helen Simpson: 'Aromatherapy in the middle of France is bordering on witchcraft.' Awareness of local customs is important when building abroad, says Jason Orme, editor of Homebuilding and Renovating magazine. 'A lot of people want to impose a mini-Britain in the middle of France, but it really isn't the way to go.' Research is the key, according to Catherine Monk, editor of Build It magazine. 'In the UK there's quite a lot of information available about planning issues. In Italy and France it can be harder to find. Do as much research as possible: talk to as many locals as you can, find out what to expect from local tradesmen. In some rural areas you may have only one builder to choose from.' Building abroad went fairly smoothly for architect Gil Briffa and his wife Hilary, who appear on the first episode of Grand Designs Abroad this Wednesday. Most of the work on their three-bedroom, 'ruthlessly modernist' retirement home on a Malaga hillside was done in 14 months.</p> <p> 'Getting planning permission in Spain - except in high-density areas - is more relaxed than in the UK,' says Gil. At one point, presenter Kevin McCloud remarks that the Spanish builders were working 'too fast for comfort' - not a problem you'd find in Britain.</p> <p> The Briffas did face opposition over their proposed colour scheme. A ruling that all new houses must be white was passed after they obtained planning permission, but the mayor and local residents were still concerned about the minty-green, blue and red ochre paintwork. The colours became the (unfavourable) talk of the town. But the Briffas were stubborn, and through their well-connected builder, Paco, managed to swing the mayor's favour. But their bold architectural statement still hasn't quite sunk in with the locals.</p> <p> Having converted two properties in Britain - a pub in St Albans, where they currently live, and a one-bedroom Georgian flat in Bath - the couple spent a long time looking for a British site for their retirement home. They eventually gave up.</p> <p> Says Gil: 'We found the prices exorbitant and the planning difficult.' The \u00a3320,000 they spent building their Malaga home would not have gone very far in England.</p> <p> Trying to oversee the project from afar, spending \u00a34,000 on flights to Malaga in just six months, and compromising on some building materials were necessary evils of building abroad. Being removed from the build wasn't so much of a problem for Gil: 'A flight to Malaga takes just over two hours; if you try to get to Bath from London on a Friday night, it can take you five hours. These short-haul flights are opening up Europe to self-builders.' Though buying for cash is the norm, some specialist brokers can arrange mortgages on self-builds abroad. Often, you have to buy the land and obtain planning permission before lenders release money.</p> <p> 'Some banks lend on construction costs,' says Simon Conn of Conti Financial Services, 'some on the total value of the finished building. It varies from country to country and lender to lender.' Additional costs can be greater when self-building abroad, says Sean Adams, European manager at Savills Private Finance. 'In Spain, the amount you pay in purchase tax, legal work and arranging finance for a self-build property is more than that for a resale property - typically 12.2 per cent compared with 11 per cent.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For more information on Gil and Hilary's home in Malaga visit <a href=\"http://www.nearmalaga.co.uk\">www.nearmalaga.co.uk</a> or watch Grand Designs Abroad, Channel 4, Wednesday, 9pm.</p>",
  "<p>Philippa's parents died recently, leaving her \u00a3150,000 from the sale of their house. She is anxious to invest this wisely. She writes: </p> <p>'Our first plan is to build an extension to add an extra bedroom, study and garden room, which will cost about \u00a350,000. Our longer-term plans are not fixed so we would like to invest the rest of the money until we are sure what we want to do.</p> <p>We might need to spend some on university education for our two children (the elder is 14) but might not because we have been given \u00a340,000 by a relative for their university education. We want to keep this money safe.</p> <p>Although it is the children's money, we have put \u00a37,000 in Abbey Growth Options Plan in my name because I am a lower-rate taxpayer than my husband. We put \u00a315,000 in National Savings Capital Bonds in the older child's name and will soon do the same for the other one, and \u00a33,000 in Bristol &amp; West Guaranteed Equity Bond in my name.</p> <p>With my inheritance, we have thought about buying another property in a few years' time, on a buy-to-rent basis. We could buy a flat where the children are at university or something locally in Swindon instead, so we don't have to worry about repairs on a house that is miles away. But I don't know whether now is the time to get on the buy-to-let bandwagon.</p> <p>Another thought is my pension. I am 45 and I would like to buy added years. I left full-time work in 1990 and since retrained as a teacher but I haven't worked full time since having the children. I am talking to the Teachers Pension Scheme about buying added years but don't have a figure yet, although I suspect it could cost a substantial amount, perhaps \u00a320,000.</p> <p>It all comes down to security in old age. My husband is 43 and is paying into a company pension, but has had various hiccups through moving jobs and with private pensions that have not performed particularly well. He would like to retire early if he could but we don't know if his pension will be enough.</p> <p>I have never filled in a tax return and wonder if being given this money affects that position?'</p> <p><strong>Put children's money in their own names</strong></p> <p>Your children, like everyone else, have a personal tax allowance of \u00a34,745 each, which is the amount they can earn this year before having to pay income tax. By investing the \u00a340,000 in their names, they make use of this allowance, whereas putting the money in your name means you have to pay tax on it. </p> <p>You can add their names to the accounts you have already to overcome this. Make sure your will specifies who the money belongs to. </p> <p>You will start paying for university costs in five years' time so money for then should be invested in cash, which includes bank or building society deposit accounts, cash Isas and most National Savings products. </p> <p>Anna Bowes of Bath-based adviser Chase de Vere points out: 'Currently, banks and building societies pay better rates than National Savings. Cheshire building society has a four-year fixed-rate bond paying 5.5 per cent gross, compared with the National Savings five-year Children's Bonus Bond paying 4.7 per cent tax-free or its five-year Capital Bond paying 5 per cent gross.' </p> <p>Assuming your children do not earn more than their personal tax allowance in a year, they can claim interest gross, so there is no advantage in choosing a lower-paying, tax-free investment. Ask the bank for Inland Revenue form R85. </p> <p>You may as well keep the stock-market investments you have just bought but switch them into cash well before you need the money in case share prices fall. </p> <p>The gift should be enough to see your children through university, so you can think about investing your inheritance for different purposes and your pension is a good place to start. </p> <p>Liz Gibling of Chase de Vere says: 'When considering whether to buy AVCs, you should take salary increases into account, as benefits are linked to an unknown salary at retirement. The rates offered by the employer may look expensive because they reflect very high assumptions for future salary inflation, but these are guaranteed. Added-years AVCs offer good value where the salary grows at a greater rate than the assumptions for salary growth, but not where salary growth is expected to be slow, in which case money purchase benefits may be a better option.' </p> <p>Either way, 'contributions to pensions are extremely tax efficient'. </p> <p>Your husband should also look at his pension arrangements, particularly if he is serious about retiring early. He should stay with his company scheme but perhaps switch the other pensions to one with cheaper charges. </p> <p>Deciding about buy-to-let is difficult, says Bowes: 'If successful, it can provide a decent income as well as capital growth, both of which are taxable.' But it is vital to do your homework, she adds: 'Check the rental market where you intend buying, as many buy-to-let owners now find it hard to rent out their properties.' </p> <p>As you have few other investments, buying a property to rent out would mean your investments are largely in the residential property market. </p> <p>Bowes advises against putting all your eggs in one basket because it significantly increases the risk profile of your investments. </p> <p>Looking at other investments, she says: 'It is important to agree on your objectives, how much risk you are happy to take, how long you want to invest for and how accessible you need the money to be. Then you need a spread of investments.' </p> <p>A balanced portfolio with moderate risk, invested for at least five years, could be spread 8 per cent cash, 20 per cent fixed-interest, 25 per cent property, 25 per cent UK equities, 15 per cent North American equities, 4 per cent European and 3 per cent Far East equities. You can reduce the risk by investing less in equities and more in fixed-interest. </p> <p>Inheritance tax will have been paid when you get your parents' money, so you need to contact the Inland Revenue only if the income you receive on the investments takes you into a higher tax bracket or you sell something at a capital gain.</p> <p><strong>Philippa's to-do list</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Think hard before buying a property to rent out.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> If you decide not to buy another property, invest your inheritance for the long term.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Invest the children's money in cash.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Complete form R85 so they receive interest gross.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Put more into your pension.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> Ask your husband to review his pensions.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> Tell the taxman if you become a higher-rate taxpayer or make a capital gain.</p> <p><strong>Let us help you</strong></p> <p>Do you need some financial coaching?

  "<p>Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has referred to it as the 'nice' decade - 10 years of non-inflationary, consistent expansion. Americans speak of the 'Great Moderation'. But whatever the designation, the phenomenon is much the same. Over the last decade, economic activity in Britain and America has continued to fluctuate, but less violently, severe recessions have been avoided and inflation has stayed low and stable. The same is true of other major economies, although Germany and Japan have performed relatively badly. </p> <p>Gordon Brown has not been slow to point out the striking improvement in Britain's economic performance. The average scale of the ups and downs in Britain's annual rate of growth over the last 10 years is less than half that seen in the 1950s and 1960s, a period historians regard as a Golden Age. And, unlike Germany and Japan, lower volatility has not been accompanied by an overall decline in the average rate of growth, leading to a remarkably long period of expansion. </p> <p>Undoubtedly the greatest triumph has been the avoidance of severe recessions - depressed periods when growth turns negative and unemployment soars. According to Professor Jordi Gali at the CREI Institute, who has developed with others a novel way of estimating some of the consequences, the severe early-1980s recession may have cost America between 3 and 12 per cent of annual household spending. In Britain, the toll was probably higher. As Gali rightly argues, limiting the depth and persistence of recessions is 'highly valuable from a social viewpoint'. </p> <p>The key question is whether stability will last. Many think not. Recent headlines predict that terrorism, high oil prices, market bubbles and natural disasters will bring greater turbulence. </p> <p>Since Britain's degree of economic tranquillity has been so exceptional and probably partly the result of luck, it would not be surprising if the next decade proved more unsettled. But there is a world of difference between a little more volatility and a return to the turbulence of the 1970s and 1980s. </p> <p>To gauge orders of magnitude, Professor Robert Rowthorn of Cambridge University and I have analysed how Britain, America, the eurozone and Japan would fare if their economies were subjected to the shocks to output, inflation, interest rates and budgets seen over the last 20 years. We chose this period because it covers a wide range of unsettling events, including, in Britain, the mid-1980s miners' strike, Chancellor Lawson's late-1980s boom and the unhappy, thankfully fleeting, membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Worldwide, there were booms and busts, currency disruptions, oil price shocks, gigantic stock market bubbles and several wars. </p> <p>Despite the scale of shocks, our calculations paint a fairly benign picture. Although projected volatility of growth and inflation rise a little in the UK over the next decade, both remain at levels below even those seen in the 1950s and 1960s. </p> <p>The chance of experiencing a severe recession also rises a little - to about 4 per cent, assuming Britain's average rate of growth is 2.5 per cent a year. But this is a huge improvement compared with the 1970s and 1980s. Elsewhere, we find only Japan remains particularly vulnerable to severe recession. </p> <p>The main cause of this enduring stability is better monetary policy and the defeat of inflation. People cease to worry about inflation when it is low and when they can rely on institutional arrangements to keep it that way. As a result, inflation is less likely to feed on itself or to be affected by changes in the pressure of demand. High inflation, by contrast, tends to self-generate and is often subject to sharp changes of gear, causing real disruption. Our analysis shows the shift from monetary neglect in the 1970s to monetary order in the 1990s to be the main force behind the global outbreak of economic stability. </p> <p>So, if stability is to last, the first condition is that the new monetary standard must survive. </p> <p>The second proviso is that the scale of the shocks and surprises that buffet economies should be no more extreme than those of the last two decades. Were there to be a major calamity of the kind mentioned in the general exclusion clauses of insurance policies, all bets would be off. But most of the identifiable dangers that fuel today's gloomy headlines do not fall into that category. </p> <p>Consider the problem of the world's undue reliance on American expansion and the associated untoward US trade deficit. The latest strategic assessment by Professor Wynne Godley and his colleagues at Cambridge shows in compelling detail how unsustainable this process is, with rising US current account and budget deficits as far as the eye can see if growth is to be maintained. </p> <p>Evidently, the pattern of US growth must eventually change to rely more on an expansion of exports relative to imports. Godley suggests a further 25 per cent dollar devaluation, combined with a significant budgetary tightening - adjustments that are unlikely to be achieved easily. </p> <p>Some form of growth disruption seems probable, but not on a scale greater than seen in the last two decades. After all, the dollar fell precipitously after 1985 and America managed to solve its then-daunting twin deficit problem while enjoying the first fruits of greater economic stability. </p> <p>Or consider the threat of high oil prices, which recently peaked at more than $45 a barrel. Even if Brent crude were to reach $50 a barrel this winter, the rise in Britain's oil import bill over the year would amount to only 0.5 per cent of national income. Taking into account the effect on Britain's oil exports, the shock would be equivalent to only 0.25 per cent of national income, a figure that pales in comparison to the 3 per cent hit the UK suffered in 1974. </p> <p>Admittedly other economies are more vulnerable but it would take a much more significant increase in oil prices to trigger a severe global recession. </p> <p>And, finally, consider the little local difficulty of Britain's over-priced housing and the sharp rise in household borrowing. Some calculations put house prices at 30 per cent or more above normal while the increase in household debt in relation to incomes has exceeded that seen at the top of the Lawson boom. As debtors are more vulnerable than savers to unpleasant shocks, this has adverse implications for stability. </p> <p>But compared with the late-1980s, today's economy is far better-placed to weather a housing market reversal. Policy is now competent and focused on domestic needs rather than on a misplaced exchange-rate target. Moreover, there is no evidence of irrational exuberance outside the housing market itself. </p> <p>At the height of the Lawson boom, inflationary pressures were rising sharply and businesses and households were collectively spending massively in excess of their disposable income. Today, inflation is under control, the stock market is drifting and private incomes exceed spending by a comfortable safety margin, thanks to companies' cash surpluses and the savings of older households. </p> <p>Will stability last? Granted average luck and our current institutions, I would be optimistic. The next decade may not prove to be as 'nice' as the last one but a 'not bad' outcome is within the bounds of probability. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bill Martin is an economic consultant</p>",
  "<p>The story could hardly be more dramatic. Over 513 pages, former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Richard Breeden accuses former Telegraph owner Lord Black and his fellow executives of systematically stealing \u00a3220 million from Hollinger International, the newspaper group Black headed, over a seven-year period. </p> <p>That amounts to 92.5 per cent of Hollinger's entire profits from 1997 to 2003. Yet last week's newspaper headlines were dominated by titillating stories about the excessive spending of Black's glamorous wife, Lady Barbara. Admittedly, her shopping list of luxury items, all paid for by Hollinger, makes for good copy: the Breeden report tells of 'handbags for Mrs BB' ($2,643), 'jogging attire for Mrs BB' ($140), exercise equipment ($2,083), 'silverware for the Blacks' corporate jet' and, perhaps most ostentatiously of all, a 'Happy Birthday Barbara' dinner party at New York's La Grenouille Restaurant ($42,870). Guests, including Oscar de la Renta, Lady Black's favourite dress designer, and American chat show queen Barbara Walters, dined on Beluga caviar, lobster ceviche and 69 bottles of fine wine. Hollinger's shareholders footed the bill. </p> <p>'At least Black's choice of venue for his wife's birthday was less expensive than Dennis Kozlowski's party for his wife on Sardinia that was charged in part to Tyco,' notes Breeden in one caustic annotation. </p> <p>The fact that Breeden chose to draw a parallel between Black's behaviour and that of the former Tyco International chief executive is no coincidence. Kozlowski's lavish spending at Tyco's expense - including buying a $6,000 shower curtain for his New York apartment - caused a sensation when it was first revealed, but it was symptomatic of a far more serious and widespread fraud. Soon after, Kozlowski and Mark Swartz, the company's chief financial officer, were charged with looting $600m from the company and hauled before a New York judge. </p> <p>In his report, Breeden also accuses Black and his fellow executives - former Hollinger vice-presidents Jack Boultbee and Peter Atkinson, Lady Black, for mer chief operating officer David Radler and ex-Telegraph CEO Dan Colson - of 'looting' Hollinger International. All six hold shares in Black's private Canadian company, Ravelston, which still owns a controlling stake in Hollinger. 'The special committee knows of few parallels to Black and Radler's brand of self-righteous and aggressive looting,' the report states. </p> <p>The most serious charges facing Black and his 'crew', as Breeden describes them, relate to 'non-compete' agreements Black and Radler signed with CanWest, a Canadian newspaper group, after Hollinger sold several of its titles to the group. </p> <p>Black and Radler told the Hollinger board that CanWest had explicitly requested a $52m payment to Ravelston, a claim described in the Breeden report as 'a complete fairy tale'. CanWest didn't make the request, but Black told the board if they didn't agree to pay it, the sale would collapse. </p> <p>Breeden's exhaustive inquiry forms the basis of a $1.25 billion lawsuit filed by Hollinger International against Black and the other Ravelston stakeholders under American racketeering laws in May. That claim could now be increased. </p> <p>The case will be heard by Judge Blanche Manning in a Chicago court sometime next year, and pre-trial hearings are scheduled to begin early next month, when Hollinger's lawyers will argue that both sides should be ready to begin proceedings by the end of the year. Black's lawyers are already using stalling tactics, insisting that the case for the defence will not be prepared until the middle of 2005 at the earliest. </p> <p>Black's Canadian holding company, Hollinger Inc, could also facing a separate civil action from the SEC, America's stock market regulator, which confirmed last week that it is considering filing a lawsuit against the company alleging violations of securities law. The special committee set up by the Hollinger International board has already retrieved $42m from Black and his fellow executives and banked \u00a3665m ($1.18bn) from the sale of the Telegraph titles, the group's prize assets, to the Barclay brothers. </p> <p>The money will be used to pay down debt and some may be returned to shareholders via a share buyback. But it is doubtful that Hollinger will be able to retrieve any more cash from the Blacks, who have already squandered the money they creamed off the company. Black, for all his riches, was living beyond his means. </p> <p>According to reports in the Toronto National Post, a paper Black once owned, Black has raised $18m by remortgaging his Toronto home. The couple's Kensington mansion is for sale and their Florida home has been on the market since early in the year. No other assets have yet been traced, although the Breeden report alleges that Black may still have several valuable items of Roosevelt memorabilia, which he acquired for $10m using Hollinger money. </p> <p>A significant share of the money Black and his cohorts 'looted' was redirected to two offshore companies, Moffat Management and Black-Amiel Management, empty shell companies registered in Barbados. A further several million dollars awarded under an incentive scheme set up by the Telegraph' s internet arm was wired to two further Barbados-based companies, Argent Barbados and Argent News. But the Barbados transactions were tax-avoidance transactions rather than a clever ploy to hide ill-gotten gains in a place where investigators would be unable to find them.</p>",
  "<p>Company directors have ignored calls for restraint over their pensions, benefitting from plans worth up to 50 times the average value of employee schemes, according to the TUC.</p> <p>The TUC's PensionsWatch report, which surveys more than 100 of Britain's top companies, has found that on average each director's pension is worth \u00a32.15 million, with the average value of the largest in each company worth \u00a34.5m. </p> <p>Eighty per cent of directors have defined benefit schemes (usually linked to final salary), while only 40 per cent of the companies still had such schemes open to new members, who otherwise have to make do with inferior, and riskier, defined contribution arrangements. </p> <p>The average director's defined benefit pension would pay out \u00a3169,000 a year if it was claimed now, some 26 times the national average. For those with the largest pension at each company, the average figure is \u00a3303,000. </p> <p>The TUC points out that CBI chief Digby Jones called for restraint over pensions at the TUC Congress last year.</p>",
  "<p>Hollinger International has taken a $7m 'hit' on the infamous collection of presidential papers bought by Conrad Black, its former chief executive.</p> <p>Black used nearly $10m of company money to buy the papers, which belonged to Franklin D Roosevelt, along with other valuable FDR memorabilia. But they have been sold for just $2.4m. </p> <p>The purchase was one of the first to be questioned by Hollinger's share holders, who forced the board to investigate allegations that Black and his fellow executives received unauthorised payments from the company. </p> <p>A report published last week accused them of 'looting' \u00a3220m from Hollinger. It also reveals that Hollinger has 'recovered from Black's control almost every item of the Grace Tully Collection', a collection of personal correspondence kept by Roosevelt's secretary which Black bought for $8m. Hollinger has sold them to a private buyer, 'at a significant financial loss compared to the inflated purchase price Black caused Hollinger to pay'. </p> <p>But Black has failed to return other items, including a bust of the famous man. 'Hollinger is in the process of retrieving the entire FDR collection from Black's residences,' the report says. Black bought the items for his private collection at inflated prices.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Death Ray</strong><br>by Daniel Clowes<br>Fantagraphics \u00a35.95</p> <p>Daniel Clowes's cartoon tale of disconnected youth, Ghost World, made a successful transition from comic book to big screen in 2001, with Terry Zwigoff's bittersweet adaptation earning widespread critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination. An earlier Clowes strip, Art School Confidential, is currently being filmed by John Malkovich's production company, with Anjelica Huston and Jim Broadbent among the cast.</p> <p>Now comes the latest instalment of the Eightball comic series in which Ghost World and Art School Confidential were originally gestated. The Death Ray revisits Clowes's trademark mix of eloquent pacing and poignant alienation, while upending the superhero genre to thoughtful and gloriously perverse effect. In keeping with superheroic conventions, a fatherless high-school loner named Andy acquires superhuman strength, not through some freakish lab mishap, but by recklessly tugging on a cigarette. (There is a curious comic-book logic here. If exposure to gamma rays, radioactive spiders and experimental serums doesn't result in hair loss or leukaemia, then surely a pack of fags might bestow superhuman gifts?)</p> <p>Armed with this new bone-crushing prowess and the eponymous vaporising ray gun, our hero proceeds to exact revenge on his tormentors. The Death Ray encompasses homicidal slapstick and insightful characterisation, as Andy searches for wrongdoing to avenge.</p> <p>Whereas comic-book heroes tend to inhabit vast metropolises crawling with criminals and homicidal scientists, Andy's world is rather like our own, with aliens and robots replaced by petty rivalries and personal anomie. Faced with a keen sense of grievance and a distinct lack of super-villains, Andy launches a low-budget campaign of terror on the nearest available substitutes - an assortment of jocks, bullies and minor jerks.</p> <p>Aided by an ambitious sidekick named Louis, Andy is obliged to manufacture increasingly questionable opportunities for his acts of righteous vengeance. A wallet is deliberately left on the pavement, while Andy and Louis wait to ambush a curious passer-by: 'What good is it having a friend with super strength if you can't even find some bullies to beat up,' moans Louis.</p> <p>Inevitably, the smallest misdemeanour results in violent beatings or disintegration, as Andy evolves from victim to hero to peevish thug. By the book's finale, Clowes's now middle-aged protagonist dimly registers how a history of small resentments has hardened into joyless and inflexible misanthropy. Early Spider-Man comic books were adorned with the stirring motto: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' Here, Clowes offers a more plausible scenario, in which great power leaves its dull and petty possessor even smaller and more vindictive.</p> <p>With its allusions to US foreign policy and acute observations of teen ennui, The Death Ray displays a genuine affection for the comic form and an urge to deconstruct it. In Clowes's capable hands, escapist iconography is given new and more resonant life, and The Death Ray reads as a cautionary parable and an acidic rumination on the travails of adolescence.</p> <p>Clowes unfolds his story by means of an artful intercutting of time frames and perspectives. This fractured narrative approach is nearer to the cinematic techniques of Robert Altman than to literature. With surprising ease, we shift from the aftermath of Andy's 'adventures' to his early experiments with smoking, while throughout an increasingly envious Louis plots an ill-fated coup.</p> <p>In taking the reader on this kaleidoscopic route, Clowes demonstrates what the comic book can do and literary fiction can't.</p>",
  "<p> A few years ago Richard E Grant appeared in Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life, a brilliant comedy short that merged Capra and Kafka. Steven Spielberg's new film, The Terminal, which is intermittently funny and very long, might well have been called Frank Capra's The Trial. Tom Hanks, America's likeable Mr Everyman, becomes the acceptable face of the alien 'other', Viktor Navorski, a sad citizen of the fictional eastern European state of Krakhozia. When a war breaks out back home while he's in transit, Viktor has his return ticket and passport impounded and becomes trapped in the international travel lounge of New York's Kennedy airport because he can't be given a visa to enter the States and is unable to return. </p> <p>It's a familiar subject, touched on with some seriousness in, for example, Casablanca and in Mitchell Leisen's Hold Back the Dawn (co-scripted by Billy Wilder) where Charles Boyer was a would-be immigrant stuck in a Mexican border town before the Second World War. Some years ago the role of Viktor would have gone to Peter Sellers or Peter Ustinov. It is important (and a canny decision by Spielberg) in these troubled times that the part is played by someone as sympathetic as Hanks, a gifted comedian who can manage guile but hasn't a streak of nastiness in him. </p> <p>From the start, Viktor plays a game of bureaucratic cat-and-mouse with the sad by-the-book Customs and Border Protection official, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci, in customarily excellent unsympathetic form), who's hoping after 17 years' dedicated service to become overall boss of airport security. Dixon treats Viktor with icy contempt as a temporary problem to be left in the lounge for a day or so with a few meal vouchers. When he appears to turn into a permanent resident, Dixon tries first to pass him over to other departments, then to facilitate his escape. But after sad blunderings, and always remaining appealingly vul nerable, Viktor starts to control his sorry situation. He sets up house in a disused wing of the airport, starts learning English and makes a few cents collecting unreturned luggage trolleys. When Dixon frustrates this source of income, he drifts into casual work with builders where his skills as an artisan bring him more an hour than Dixon himself earns. Eventually he can afford a Hugo Boss suit (part of the film's relentless product placement) in which to court a beautiful air hostess (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whose confidence in human goodness he's helping to restore. </p> <p>A good deal of this is ingenious and funny. But the movie is heading steadily into Capraesque sentimentality as Viktor becomes the close friend of an elderly Indian cleaner, a Hispanic kitchen worker (for whom he acts as Cupid with a customs clerk) and a black baggage attendant. Climactically he becomes the hero of not only the exploited, multi-ethnic employees of the terminal shops, but also of the immigration staff (Dixon excepted of course). It also turns out that Viktor had not come to the States for social or economic advantage but to honour his late father by executing a symbolic act of filial piety that can be seen as highly flattering to American culture. </p> <p>Those who loathe everything about airport terminals (the mirrored surfaces, the neon lighting, the muzak, the hideous acoustics, the perpetual queues, the lifeless throngs, the announcements, the exclusivity of private lounges) will find this movie oppressive in the way the makers probably intended. The brilliant set, the work of production designer Alex McDowell, is like a flashy annexe of hell, and the film's length gives Viktor's plight a sense of eternity, or at least of time suspended. The compassion, however, is, if not exactly false, too thin to bear the crushing weight of the sentimentality.</p>",
  "One of London's popular celebrity haunts has been shut down by police under new powers following a three-month undercover operation into drug dealing on the premises. <p>Trap nightclub in Wardour Street, Soho, famous for its clientele of soap stars and minor pop bands, was raided by officers from Scotland Yard's clubs and vice unit at 11.30pm on Thursday. </p> <p>Earlier detectives arrested five people - two men in a nearby street and two men and a woman at a flat in Russell Square - on suspicion of possession of drugs with intent to supply. It is understood at least one gun was also found. </p> <p>Three of those arrested are thought to have worked at the club in some capacity, which is part owned by Fran Cosgrove, a former bodyguard for the Irish boy band Westlife. </p> <p>The five suspects, all aged in their 20s, were being questioned by detectives at a central London police station last night. </p> <p>A website describes the split-level club with its leather sofas as having a \"chic and vibrant\" atmosphere, popular with celebrities such as wannabe club queen Jodie Marsh as well as manufactured pop bands Westlife, Triple 8, Girls Aloud and Black Eyed Peas, while Vin Diesel, the Hollywood action star, even held the launch party for his latest film there. </p> <p>But a picture was also emerging yesterday of a club where drug dealing was open and rife, with a history of disturbances and serious assaults on both staff and customers. </p> <p>\"We have to be realistic about drugs, they are always going to be part of the club world,\" said Superintendent Chris Bradford, the man in charge of the drugs and clubs unit who led the raid. \"But when it gets to the stage where young people can't even get through the foyer without being offered drugs then obviously we are going to take an interest.\" </p> <p>Undercover officers, who began surveillance inside the nightclub three months ago after tip-offs from members of the public, witnessed drugs being sold openly, with the management apparently doing nothing to try to stop it. </p> <p>\"Certainly nobody seemed too perturbed by it,\" Supt Bradford said. \"Nobody was worrying about prying eyes, so I suppose you could say it was being done openly.\" </p> <p>The police operation, codenamed Asiento, culminated with Thursday night's arrests and the issuing of a closure order under section 1 of the Antisocial Behaviour Act. </p> <p>The act, which came into force last year, is used in the main to close down crack houses, but police believe it can also be applied to clubs where the use of class A drugs is rife. </p> <p>\"This is the first time that we have used new powers given to us under the Antisocial Behaviour Act in this way,\" Supt Bradford said. </p> <p>\"The club is not only associated with drug dealing but also serious disturbances and even, we believe, assaults. I believe this new legislation is best suited for the closure of such a dangerous and irresponsibly run club.\" </p> <p>The raid on Trap is just the latest drugs scandal to engulf London's celebrity haunts. </p> <p>Three years ago Home in Leicester Square - labelled the king of Britain's so called superclubs - had its entertainment licence revoked after a similar undercover operation found drug dealing was rife at the venue. </p> <p>The club, the launch of which was attended by stars such as The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, Jay Kay, Denise Van Outen, Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood, was forced to close. </p> <p>Two years ago Soho House, the chic London members' club, was forced to introduce a stringent anti-drug policy after the two-year-old daughter of actors Jude Law and Sadie Frost swallowed an ecstasy tablet at a children's party. </p> <p>\"We will keep on working to make sure that central London's nightclubs remain safe places for the thousands who visit every weekend,\" Supt Bradford said yesterday. </p> <p>\"No-one should have to tolerate their night out being plagued by a drug dealer.\" </p> <p>The Guardian tried to contact the management of the club yesterday but was unable to get a response.</p>",
  "<p>It's not until you become a parent that you realise how important it is to have mastered, during the many preceding years of childlessness, at least one of the skills that will always be guaranteed to inspire unquestioning admiration in your offspring. These talents have nothing to do with academic achievement, and everything to do with flexible body parts and a total lack of inhibition. An ability to curl the outer edges of the tongue inwards is always popular, as is the knack of waggling the ears independently of any other facial furniture. Demonstrative displays of double-jointedness never fail to pull a rapt crowd; the same goes for the art of blowing tunefully through blades of grass and, however ineptly executed, a basic knowledge of the principles of juggling. </p> <p>But it pains me to admit that, so far, I have not managed any of the above. Among groups of small children, I offer very poor value indeed. I cannot produce coins from behind the ears of unsuspecting infants or cross my eyes on demand. I consistently fail to thrill with dazzling displays of knuckle-cracking, armpit-farting and tricks involving handkerchiefs and lit candles. My pathetic grasp of even remedial skills such as whistling and finger-clicking elicits, from young audiences, pitying looks and disappointed sighs. However, like all the best amateur conjurers, I have a trump card up my sleeve, and while it may be less obviously showy than anything you can do with a ping-pong ball and a particularly elastic set of facial muscles, I feel it is, nevertheless, something worth sharing. </p> <p>At its most basic, this skill manifests itself in harmonising the last line of Happy Birthday at celebration teas. Moving up a notch, it involves going off on one during the third verse of O Come All Ye Faithful at Christmas carol concerts. It recently surfaced in even more advanced form at my daughter's karaoke party, when I wrenched the microphone from the sticky hand of a prepubescent Britney-alike and sang Nancy Sinatra's tricky harmony to my husband's melodious Frank in a shaky yet rousing rendition of Something Stupid. Puzzlingly, the crowd of 11-year-old girls didn't react in quite the way I'd expected. There were no whoops and cheers or ecstatic cries for more, simply a stunned silence, a lot of ostentatious eye-rolling and a subsequent demand from our mortified daughter never again to subject her friends to a freak show of such eye-watering crassness. </p> <p>But I am undeterred. More accurately, I am powerless to resist. I am hereby outing myself as a compulsive harmoniser of any given tune, from the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo TV ad to the theme music from Balamory. I have been doing it ever since the early 1970s, when my younger sister and I would stand washing up at the kitchen sink while finessing our version of Ken Boothe's Everything I Own - she bullied into plugging away with the melody while I grandstanded with the harmony. </p> <p>On Sundays, I would sing a mean descant to The Lord Is My Shepherd in the church choir, enjoying the pulse-quickening, though not entirely God-fearing, thrill that came with embellishing the tune with something more complex and, I thought, many times more skilful. </p> <p>It is this self-congratulatory smugness inherent in the habitual harmoniser that has recently provoked ugly scenes in our household. The other day, I was minding my own business, improving the dire Anglia News theme with some quietly hummed twiddly bits, when my husband blurted out that he and the children find my habit intensely annoying - not the sound so much as the psychological machinations behind it. </p> <p>He cited the example of family singalongs on protracted car journeys, when, more often than not, I refuse to toe the line with everyone else and instead meander off down the seductive paths of B flat and D minor. It is, he says, a sly form of oneupmanship: I may be affecting an inconsequential supporting role to the main event, but in fact I am simply showing off and attempting to hog the limelight. </p> <p>Was Richard Carpenter ever thus accused by the saintly Karen? Did Peters and Lee fall out over who sang high or low on Welcome Home? How did the Everly Brothers divvy up their lines so as not to alienate the other? Surely it was never seen as a competition. I feel I speak for all harmonising underdogs when I say that we are modest folk for whom the inner glow of a job well done is recognition enough. (For Nancy Sinatra, I make an exception. Her scene-stealing work on Something Stupid is the closest anyone has ever come to reducing Frank to the ranks of jobbing pub singer.) </p> <p>Still, since the Anglia News debacle, I have been silenced somewhat. In the car during the summer holidays, covering many road miles and countless hours of the Thrills, Stevie Wonder and Busted, depending on who had control of the CD player, I have been biting my lip and keeping my harmonies to myself. Perhaps, in the light of the widespread irritation my habit clearly provokes, I should limit my experience of harmony to that which is interpreted by paint charts and, finally, concentrate on choosing a bathroom suite that matches the curtains. And if that doesn't succeed in wowing the kids, learn to waggle my ears instead.</p>",
  "<p>In the old days, workers were divided into blue collar and white collar. Nowadays, they're divided into those who work standing up and those who work sitting down. Interestingly, when workers strike, they make a big effort not to sit down. Instead, they stand on picket lines, because sitting down would imply that they were too lazy to work in the first place. Only students do sit-ins, but this is still more active than what they normally do, which is lie-ins. </p> <p>Sitting is generally recognised to be the halfway state between waking and sleeping. That's why you don't have chairs in your kitchen or bedroom. Chairs are for waiting rooms, sitting rooms and meeting rooms. In all of these, no real work takes place. </p> <p>Children are expert sitters, possibly because they have a much closer relationship with the ground. Some adults also sit on the floor. These adults view chairs as instruments of capitalist oppression and like to sit cross-legged on the floor to show how grounded and environmentally friendly they are. Theoretically, they could travel in the cargo hold on aeroplanes because they don't need a seat, but they never seem to volunteer for this. </p> <p>How you sit on a chair tells the world all about your sexuality. Men who sit with their legs wide apart are generally airing their dominant organ. These men also tend to sit low in the chair, as if to suggest that the sheer weight of their genitalia is dragging them downwards. At the other end of the spectrum are men who cross their legs above their knee and point their toes. This signifies that they are very at home with their feminine side. That, or they are desperate for the loo. The fact that women often sit cross-legged may be an evolutionary response to an inadequate supply of ladies' conveniences. </p> <p>When faced with an armchair, a significant proportion of people put their legs over the arms. In a sofa, they may even put their legs over the backrest. This is a primitive wombing reflex with only the umbilical remote control and mobile phone to link them to the outside world. </p> <p>Old people often have special chairs that tilt and rock. These are basically flight simulators, and they let old people have slow-motion rollercoaster rides when you're not looking.</p>",

When I decided to be a self payer I took the steps you recommend, and reserved the money I would have paid to the insurance schemes into a separate private account. </p> <p>I have recently had, at the age of 60, a radical circumcision by a specialist surgeon in an NHS clinic. The cost was \u00a3400: \u00a3100 for the consultation, and \u00a3300 for the operation. If I add on the taxi fare of \u00a360 to take me home across London then the total bill was \u00a3460, rather different to the \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,600 quote by Bupa in your article. </p> <p>It is now quite easy to choose your own treatment from the web.

  "It is Thursday night and the young of Tel Aviv are queuing for their supplies for the big night out of the Jewish week. <p>At the city-centre kiosks, some customers ask for cigarettes or some gum, but about one in three furtively inquires: \"Hagigat?\" </p> <p>The shopkeeper looks straight ahead. His hand moves below the counter and he pulls out a small white capsule, which he exchanges discreetly for 50 shekels (\u00a36.50). </p> <p>Hagigat is the latest in a line of legal drugs which add spice to Tel Aviv's already potent night life. </p> <p>It means \"party\" in Hebrew and is derived from khat, a plant chewed in Somalia and Yemen for its amphetamine effect. Other legal drugs include \"liquid energy\", a test tube of viscous plant extracts, and amyl nitrate or poppers. </p> <p>As Tuesday's suicide bomb attack in Beersheba demonstrated, the conflict continues; Palestinian frustration is boiling less than a 20-minute drive from Tel Aviv. Yet the party goes on, driven by a desire to escape the grim realities of Israeli life. </p> <p>In the past four years of the intifada, Tel Aviv's nightlife has gone from strength to strength. Larger and better bars, and clubs that would put London, New York and Paris to shame, open and close regularly to satisfy fickle tastes. </p> <p>The only major upset was the killing of 21 young people in June 2001 as they queued for the Dolphinarium nightclub on the city seafront. </p> <p>\"It was only when there was the bombing at the Dolphinarium that it hit people,\" said Amir Bar Yitzhak, the editor of the Leyla nightlife website. </p> <p>\"That was right at the centre of nightlife. That started a decline in people going out, but they got used to it. Then people decided they were going to go out in spite of everything and party until they fell down. That has levelled out a bit now and things are more normal.\" </p> <p>Legal drugs have become a major part of the hedonism. Hagigat is described on the packaging as \"an aphrodisiac of organic material. 100% natural without chemicals\". </p> <p>\"Drink after food and take with a lot of water. Sell only to those over 18,\" it advises. </p> <p>Ronen Hazut, the owner of a city-centre kiosk, said: \"Hagigat sells fast. People take this pill and say it's amazing. It's our biggest money maker and that's why we sell it.\" </p> <p>Moshe Haimkevitch, his partner who has taken the drug, said: \"You feel high, but you're still alert and know what you're doing. You have power and energy, and most important, it makes you incredibly horny,\" he told the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. </p> <p>Another popular product is Liquid Energy, sold at a similar price. \"This is drunk mainly during parties, and has to be shaken well. It has good effects and gives energy,\" said Mr Haimkevitch. </p> <p>In the past year several new venues have opened, described as \"pick-up\" bars. They feature large serving areas surrounded by scores of bar stools to ensure that everyone is visible to members of the opposite sex. </p> <p>David Tur opened Tel Aviv's largest bar, Lansky, last year. It cost more than a \u00a31m to fit out and features 100 bar stools around the longest bar in the Middle East, if not Europe. </p> <p>\"People come here because they want to see people. The customers here are mostly single or cheaters,\" he said. \"This place is labelled a pick-up bar. I don't know what that means. There is a lot of interaction between people who don't know each other. If that makes it a pick-up bar, then it is.\" </p> <p>Mr Tur, who worked in London for several years, said the nightlife experience in Tel Aviv was totally different. </p> <p>\"The interaction is very different here compared to London. Here you can see everybody, you are sitting next to everybody. It's not like you are going to a bar with your friends, you are sharing the experience with everyone,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Bar Yitzhak added: \"The atmosphere is warm, open and welcoming. Everything is straightforward. There is rarely any violence and you don't see any obvious drunkenness. You can always make friends; there is always someone to talk to.\" </p> <p>When drawn on the subject, most Tel Aviv residents favour compromise to achieve peace with the Palestinians. But on the whole they try to block out the military regime and the oppression of Palestinians. </p> <p>\"I can appreciate it isn't much fun living in a refugee camp, or in the West Bank,\" Mr Bar Yitzhak said. \"But I think it is hard for people elsewhere to imagine what it is like for someone to come to your favourite bar or cafe and blow themselves up. </p> <p>\"We are in the middle of the barrel of a gun, yet everything is still so alive.\" </p> <p><b>A resident of Israel, originally from the UK, describes taking hagigat:</b> </p> <p>I discreetly slip the capsule into my mouth and wash it down with Czech beer. Around the bar, I can see groups of men and women talking animatedly and some are dancing. </p> <p>Typical Brit, I won't dance or initiate conversation. </p> <p>\"Where you are from?\" pipes up one of my female neighbours.\"So you like Israel?\" she continues. </p> <p>Rather than retreat into my shell, I smile broadly and start to chat. I feel a tingly sensation and a sense of confidence. I've had just one small glass of beer: this could only be the hagigat. </p> <p>The music is now flowing through my body. I look around the bar indulgently. This is a great night. </p> <p>Now I feel more than warm, almost sensuous.I need to stroke something, anything. The feeling remains with me for the next couple of hours. </p> <p>Eventually I feel a sense of anxiety and the warmth decreases. I feel impatient and I need another drink or maybe just another hagigat.</p>",

Austria 0 England 2</strong> Magnificent goal from Steven Gerrard! Owen laid a short ball to him 25 yards out, and he whipped across it to send an absolute screamer into the far corner. It dipped and curved majestically. Not dissimilar to Beckham's goal in La Coruna two years ago, and another stormer for Gerrard in Austria after two for Liverpool the other week. And game over, too.</p> <p><strong>64 min</strong> \"To answer Lee Matthews' question about SWP - he's more like Lawrence Booth than Barry Glendenning,\" says Matthew Cobb. \"Younger, slimmer and less cynical! And Larry's a City supporter.\" That he is. But it's <em>Lawro</em> in GU Towers. Or The Machine. Or I, Boothy.</p> <p><strong>62 min</strong> England are a lot more ragged now, but these things are relative: Austria are a poor side, and they'd struggle to take advantage of a drunk, lonely minute-by-minute reporter, let alone a slightly nervy England defence.</p> <p><strong>59 min</strong> Ridiculous antics from David James. Long, straight ball from the back, and as Haas marched on to it 35 yards out, James appeared from nowhere and was rounded as easily as a statue in a training drill. Thankfully John Terry got back to clear off the line: Haas's effort from near the touchline was just sneaking in at the near post.</p> <p><strong>56 min</strong> Like Stifler, Ashley Cole takes one for the team. A whack, in this case. But he's OK.</p> <p><strong>54 min</strong> ...which ends with Kuhbauer drilling one from 25 yards which the ever-reliable David James lets through his hands and manages to save only between his legs. Good spell for Austria, this.</p> <p><strong>53 min</strong> Corner to Austria...</p> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Outstanding save from Manninger. Some dreadful defending left Smith eight yards out, with the goal at his mercy. He picked his spot and Manninger, flinging himself to the left like a turncoat politician, made an outstanding reaction save. Shades of the 1997/98 title run-in. But Smith should have scored. \"Isn't it Keith Moon on the right?\" chuckles Andrew Nichols, ruining a beautiful moment by adding one of these :-)</p> <p><strong>49 min</strong> Low shot from Owen, on the corner of the box, dribbles along for Manninger to make a comfortable save.</p> <p><strong>48 min</strong> One of those trademark pre-emptive dives from Beckham earns Pogatetz a yellow card. Actually on reflection that wasn't a nice tackle. \"Did you catch the pre-match 'Barbarella' show as described on Five Live?\" says Mark Judd. \"It didn't manage to shut Alan Green up though.\" Afraid not, but it sounds at least 400 times more entertaining than the main fare.</p> <p><strong>46 min</strong> They're back on.</p> <p><strong>More chatter</strong> \"Alvin Martin for England manager,\" says a straight-faced Gavin Hollis. \"I'm listening to the game on Talksport.com. The commentators (Alvin Martin) keep going on about how this is \"unofficial coverage\" - does this mean they are likely to be arrested at some point for illegal football banter? And does anybody know why the game isn't on the Beeb?\"</p> <p><strong>SWP</strong> \"I live in Madrid and have never actually seen Shaun Wright-Phillips play,\" says Lee Matthews. \"What kind of a player is he? Who would you compare him to?\" Hmm, tricky. He's got the lot: chief qualities are extreme pace and seriously tricky feet, plus he works back as hard as any winger since Giggs in the mid-90s. He can pass, shoot from range, and he's just maturing into a top-class player. As for a comparison, I really don't know. Like GU's Barry Glendenning, he defies comparison. </p> <p><strong>Anti-3-5-2 rant from Brooks Davis</strong> \"So, Rob, the 4-4-2 is part of the English cultural identity.\" So is the punch-up; it doesn't make it right. \"Why doesn't Eriksson just get Alan Thompson of Celtic for the left wing? He plays there consistently and well.\" Alan Thompson?!</p> <p><strong>Half-time chit-chat</strong> \"Is the Bridge and Cole partnership on the left going well?\" asks Richard Tucker. No. The plus is that there has been no attacking threat at all from Austria down that side. (Or the middle, or their left.) But Bridge, when he gets the ball, is always stuck, and veering infield. He looks what he is: a player out of position. Now if we were playing 3-5-2...</p> <p><strong>Half time</strong> Well it was as dull as we feared, but England have done a pretty efficient job, and lead deservedly through a very, very clever goal from Frank Lampard. Who says all English footballers are brainless dunces, eh?</p> <p><strong>42 min</strong> Martin Tyler can't stop talking about Alex Manninger's career. You'd almost think he was an Arsenal fan, eh? \"It's Chris De Burgh on the right, not Baker,\" says Tim Smillie. \"You melon.\"</p> <p><strong>40 min</strong> Trademark Owen run in behind to a long pass from Gerrard (I think, if only 'cause it's always him who plays such passes), and Manninger - at least a yard outside the box - made an orthodox save...and the referee's assistant waved played on. That would and should have been a red card.</p> <p><strong>38 min</strong> Sam Herbert has just pointed out that the mighty Greece are 2-0 down ... to Albania. There's a moral in that, and here it is: IF YOU WEREN'T SO NEGATIVE SVEN WE'D BE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS AS WE'D HAVE BEATEN THE DUTCH WHO WERE RUBBISH AND AS FOR GREECE WELL LOOK.</p> <p><strong>37 min</strong> Little bit of pressure from Austria, but they showed all the punch of a pacifist with two broken hands. \"Why the hell is there no highlights of this game on terrestrial television?!\" thunders Jonny May. \"If there was I wouldn't have to bother with this sort of thing, it's a fine state of affairs etc.\" Unattractive an option as it is on a balmy late-summer Saturday night, you could always go to the pub.</p> <p><strong>35 min</strong> So what's happening here is what we should have seen in the summer: England are 1-0 up, and bossing possession and the game completely. Shame they (or more likely Sven) doesn't have the courage to do it against half-decent teams, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Like Bjork said, it's all gone quiet. \"Has Hod said anything ridiculous yet?\" says Ian Bruff. Annoyingly, no, apart from his perpetual misuse of 'them'. To be fair to Hod, I think he's an outstanding coach, and even now you can see he reads the game superbly. Shame he couldn't man-manage a pot plant, eh?</p> <p> <strong>28 min</strong> That's knocked the stuffing right out of Austria, who are still bleating about the free-kick. \"Is it just me or is that Danny Baker in the picture with Ethan Hawke and Judy Delpy and not Richard Linklater?\" says someone who didn't bother revealing their name. It's just you. And it's Julie.</p> <p><strong>26 min</strong> \"You are a hell of a lot more entertaining and make a lot more sense than Graham Taylor on Five Live anyway,\" says Simon Rose. \"So cheers!\" Sob. I think that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Austria 0 England 1</strong> Superb goal from Frank Lampard. Beckham lined up the blast, Austria charged en masse, and Beckham simply tapped it diagonally to his left for Lampard to score from, ooh, two yards out. Clever stuff.</p> <p><strong>23 min</strong> That was weird: Neville fizzed one low across the face, the defender knocked it square six yards out and then stopped, and Manninger dived on it with Owen about to pounce. Then the defender claimed he heard a whistle. Which, in hindsight, he did - though not from the referee. And it probably wasn't a backpass either. Let's hope they don't pay for it, eh?</p> <p>b&gt;22 min Handled backpass gives England a free-kick six yards out. \"You are not alone,\" says Georg Oppitz, doing his best Embrace impression. \"I am an Austrian who is sitting in Canada and is supporting England. Actually I think most of the Austrian football supporters hope that England wins (preferably by a high margin) - otherwise Krankl doesn't get the sack.\" So what's he done wrong, then, apart from inadvertently evoke memories of Jimmy Krankie? </p> <p> <strong>19 min</strong> England are starting to boss possession now, with Austria settling snugly into a revolutionary 8-0-2 formation. Meanwhile, Italy are 1-0 down at home to Norway. Hahahahahahahahahahaha, and so on.</p> <p><strong>16 min</strong> Like a minute-by-minute reporter striving for a decent analogy and singularly failing, England haven't really got going yet. Then, from nowhere, Lampard clips a cross from deep and Owen, straining his neck muscles, loops a header on to the top of the net from the edgge of the box. Very good effort.</p> <p><strong>15 min</strong> Bizarrely, there are Peter Werth advertising hoardings all round the ground, bizarrely. I used to have these lovely silky Peter Werth trousers, only for fashion to render them redundant. I was as gutted as Drew Barrymore after about eight minutes of Scream.</p> <p><strong>13 min</strong> First move of quality from England. Diagonal, sliderule pass from Gerrard of the very highest order and Owen, under pressure from behind, sliced his shot.</p> <p><strong>11 min</strong> Free-kick to England on the left. Like an angry drunk on Rochester High Street, Beckham hits the first man.</p> <p><strong>9 min</strong> Since you ask, I don't like Bridge on the left of midfield. If it has to be either it should be Cole, a fleet-footed, clincal and clean attacking threat. What it should really be, of course, is 3-5-2, with Cole and either Neville or Wright-Phillips, depending on the ability of the opposing left-winger. But as that's about as likely to happen as Girls Aloud being minute-by-minute devotees, I shall change the subject.</p> <p><strong>6 min</strong> First sign of danger as Kuhbauer clips a ball in behind for Haas, but Gary Neville covers superbly to concede a corner. Austria are a huge side physically, so, at these set-pieces, they'll fancy themselves more than a harem of Hoxtonites.</p> <p><strong>5 min</strong> Slow start, with no real pattern to the game thus far. \"Why don't you get yourself a TiVo and then we wouldn't have to have this conversation,\" says Richard Tucker, cheerily. And what would they be, then?</p> <p><strong>2 min</strong> Alan Smith cuts infield and fizzes a daisy-cutter from 20 yards; comfortable save. \"I can't tell from this distance: Is the game over?\" asks Ray Vickey. \"Is 0-0 the score? Will Wilber ever play the violin again? Is there life before death?\" Ooookay.</p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Like fellas on Rochester High Street, they've kicked off. This is it, then: England post-Portugal, post-Scholesy.</p> <p><strong>Random thoughts from Ian Bruff</strong> \"Considering Before Sunset is 80 minutes long you could see if you can download it and watch that instead of the bore-fest that will be this match.\" Good point, well etc. I could be giddily supping expensive champagne on Upper Street while idly passing the time with Hollyoaks lookalikes right here now, so I could. England to bag a Worzel Gummidge-scruffy 2-1 win, I say.</p> <p><strong>Atmosphere etc</strong> It's a cracking atmosphere, so much so that it'd be intimidating if Austria's side wasn't as modest as a virginal bride's dress.</p> <p><strong>Kit news</strong> Austria are now wearing red - apparently at the behest of former-legend-and-now-half-decent-and-quite-gobby-manager Hans Krankl, which means England, like blushing brides, are wearing white.</p> <p><strong>Hod's the co-commentator!</strong> I promised you wit...</p> <p><strong>Before Sunset denouement</strong> \"Yes, they did,\" says Faical El Khayal. \"But they left an open door at the end, which they will surely cross in the third instalment: Before Tomorrow. Basically they will have twelve hours before Julie has to go under the knife for a new hip.....Now, for some wit.\" Oh yikes. In the meantime, thoughts on the England team: it should be 3-5-2, but it isn't, so we get Bridge and Cole doubling up on the left, and Smith up front. I think the latter makes sense - Defoe, Vassell and Owen are all too similar, and though Smith is dissimilar to Rooney, he at least offers a contrast to Owen. Shame Shaun Wright-Phillips isn't playing, though. Like Dirk Diggler, he's going to be a big, bright, shining star.</p> <p><strong>Team news culled clinically from the wires</strong><br> <strong>Austria:</strong> Manninger, Standfest, Pogatetz, Aufhauser, Hiden, Stranzl, Sick, Kuhbauer, Glieder, Ivanschitz, Haas. Subs: Mandl, Dospel, Hieblinger, Katzer, Kiesenebner, Linz, Kollmann. <br> <strong>England:</strong> James, G Neville, A Cole, Terry, King, Gerrard, Lampard, Beckham, Bridge, Smith, Owen. Subs: Robinson, Carragher, Dyer, J Cole, Wright-Phillips, Defoe, Vassell. </p> <p><strong>Preamble + desperate plea</strong> Having fallen asleep like a worked-to-the-bone minute-by-minute reporter this afternoon with about 10 minutes of Before Sunset to go, I'd love to know how it ends. Anyone? In return I'll pledge to deliver more wit in this report than in 10 readings of The Franklin's Tale. Or some such.</p>",
  "<p>C harles Dickens wrote in The Pickwick Papers, \"Everybody knows Kent - apples, cherries, hops and women.\" But as I peered out through the window of my little hut, there was not an oast house or fruit tree in sight. Instead, small fishing boats bobbed gently in the harbour, hazy sunshine silhouetting them against a buttery sky. </p> <p>Whitstable has become a haven for Londoners looking to escape the stress of town for a few days. What was once \"run-down\" is now seen as \"delightfully kitsch\", which means that Whitstable is cool. Again. </p> <p>My beach hut hideaway is one of eight that have been renovated by the local Oyster Fishery Company, which owns the nearby Hotel Continental. They were originally used by local fishermen as shelters and storage for their lobster pots. But the only people seeking refuge in them nowadays are couples looking for a romantic weekend away without the hassle of aeroplanes and passports. </p> <p>After check-in, we opened the minuscule door and climbed the ladder to our small room. The white wooden walls are simply decorated with black-and-white photos of Whitstable. There's everything you'd expect in a good (no frills) hotel room - TV, mini-bar, small shower room - and family huts have extra rooms downstairs. </p> <p>With the sun casting long shadows on the pebbles outside, we decided to join the late-afternoon strollers with a walk to the nearby Old Neptune for a drink. On the way, we passed a hotchpotch of old wooden cottages, each with its own little garden and almost privatebeach. Unlike many seaside towns, littered with amusement arcades and boy racers completing laps of the one-way system, Whitstable has got its priorities right. The little road running through it is tucked away behind seafront cottages, and the only sounds you hear on the beach are the gentle rattle of pebbles crunching underfoot and the sea lapping on the shore. The harbour is beautifully unspoilt and still forms the base for the thriving local fishing trade, with a market each morning furnishing the town's restaurants. </p> <p>Overlooking this hive of local industry is the Crab &amp; Winkle (South Quay, The Harbour, 01227 779377), our venue for dinner, only five minutes' walk from the beach hut. As you'd expect, the restaurant specialises in local seafood, but the name actually comes from what is claimed to be the world's first steam-driven passenger railway, which first ran from Whitstable harbour to Canterbury in 1830. Orange and peach walls give the interior a slightly Mediterranean feel, with dark wooden beams and booths adding to the sense of intimacy. I opted for skate cheeks wrapped in parma ham (\u00a314.95), which was excellent, while my girlfriend enjoyed a panache of gourmet mushrooms and asparagus tips (\u00a312.95). </p> <p>The High Street offers many other eating options, and Wheeler's Oyster Bar is an absolute gem; you can enjoy the local speciality in the intimacy of the tiny dining room or buy cockles from the bar to take away. On the seafront, Royal Native Oyster Stores is more pricey, with dishes like whole roasted sea bass with garlic and rosemary for \u00a319.50. Three miles down the road, at Seasalter, acclaimed gastropub The Sportsman offers locally sourced meat and fresh seafood. </p> <p>Whitstable is also home to a thriving artists' community. The Terence Macklin Gallery on Harbour Street has original paintings from around \u00a3250, while the nearby Harbour Gallery and Whitstable Fine Art offer more affordable prints. </p> <p>Even more famous than local heroine Tracy Emin, the great victorian artist JMW Turner was a long-time resident of Margate along the coast and was fascinated by its pure, bright light; he thought the town has the most beautiful sunsets in Europe. </p> <p>Until recently the sun seemed to have set for good on this once thriving holiday hotspot, leaving behind a gaudy litter of amusement arcades and little else. Now a regeneration programme is underway, and just behind the tasteless seafront the Old Town should soon become a hub of artistic activity, with new art galleries opening up, as well as a recording studio and a multi-media workshop. </p> <p>We called in at the Outfitters Gallery (20 The Parade, 01843 220204) - a modern friendly venue showcasing work by contemporary artists. Converted from a tailor's shop, there is a courtyard area at the back and delightful, boutique-style B&amp;B above the gallery with two rooms (doubles from \u00a375 per night). Just along the street, in the Market Place, the Community Pharmacy Gallery (01843 223800), aims to nurture local talent. </p> <p>But perhaps the biggest change to Margate's fortunes will come in the form of the new Turner Centre for the visual arts which is due to open in 2007 on the town's stone pier. </p> <p>We drove on down to Ramsgate for lunch at Thai restaurant, Surin (30 Harbour Street, 01843 592 001), where the specials' board offered local delicacies like sea bass in panang curry sauce.Then we wandered by the waterfront, past the gleaming white gin palaces moored in the marina and along the Royal Esplanade to the Iota Gallery. There's more to the south east than oast houses and run-down amusement arcades. </p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> </p> <p>The Oyster Fishery Company (01227 280280, <a href=\"http://www.hotelcontinental.co.uk\">hotelcontinental.co.uk</a>) offers two-person fisherman's huts for the weekend (minimum booking Friday and Saturday night) for \u00a3130 per night, Sunday-Thursday \u00a3100 per night; family huts \u00a3150 per night weekends, Sunday-Thursday \u00a3115 per night. </p> <p><strong> Further information: </strong> Kent Tourism Alliance 0906 2941191, <a href=\"http://www.kenttourism.co.uk\">kenttourism.co.uk</a>.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> We would recommend taking a water purifier. We use a fairly expensive one but each cartridge filters up to 100 gallons, and produces microbiologically pure water. We filter tap water for cleaning teeth and drinking. Bottled water in India is fairly cheap but you need to check that it is in fact sterile, as the caps may have been tampered with. There is also a distressing amount of plastic waste lying around in India and buying plastic bottles adds to this problem.<br> <a href=\"mailto:Halcyon.leonard@care4free.net\">James &amp; Halcyon Leonard</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For all the effort of filtering water, it is a lot easier to simply buy bottled. It is very cheap and very plentiful, given the amount you will drink in the heat, and most importantly it is more likely to be cold. If you are doing some hardcore trekking then it may be helpful to have a water filter when up in the mountains for example (there is always something following the water further up stream however pure a mountain stream looks!) but for general travelling around India there is always a shop. Make sure, however, that the seal is intact on the bottle (ask the shop keeper / waiter to bring it out unopened) and on glass bottle carbonated water check that the sealed bottle cap matches the brand on the bottle label - unbranded gold caps are evidence of \"soda stream\" style fill ups potentially from the tap. Check out lime sodas without sugar - fizzy water with fresh lime juice, far more refreshing than filtered water. <br> <a href=\"mailto:Mail@egelnickandwebb.com\">Toby Egelnick</a></p>",

  "<p>Finland doesn't feel quite like anywhere else. And nowhere more so than the country's capital, Helsinki, a flat peninsula of reclaimed marshland jutting into the Baltic.</p> <p>With its cafe culture and cobbled, tree-lined avenues, it feels partly like a classic European capital city. Yet its cleanliness, penchant for pickled fish and efficient public services are pure Scandinavian. Then, when you're least expecting it, pockets of old Russia crop up in the food, quirky coffee shops and older architecture. The 1983 film Gorky Park wasn't shot here for nothing.</p> <p>Finland is the seventh largest European country, yet the population is only a little over five million, of whom only 560,000-odd live in Helsinki. Making a Saturday afternoon stroll around the city's shops is a disarmingly peaceful experience. Something that, according to one local at least, goes some way to explaining the Finns' reputation of being a little icy: \"We are still not used to tourists,\" she says. \"We like them but we get shy.\"</p> <p>Yet it's a wonder the place hasn't been overrun with tourists for years; the city has over 30 art galleries and museums, an abundance of stylish bars and slick modern restaurants, and a crop of cutting-edge music, fashion and design talent that's being poached by movers and shakers from New York, Paris and London, all after a slice of Nordic cool.</p> <p><strong> The perfect day</strong></p> <p><strong> Morning</strong><br></p> <p>For a peaceful, pastoral start to the day, head for the beautiful <strong> Seurasaari island</strong>, west of the city centre and linked to the mainland by a footbridge. The leafy roads winding through this national park area are lined with gorgeous 19th-century wooden villas, some of which have been converted into cafes. <strong> Villa Angelica</strong> (Tamminiementie 3, +9 458 4081, open 11am-11pm Mon-Sun) is full of antiques, chandeliers and bulging dressers of mismatched crockery; you can sit inside or on the veranda and enjoy a coffee and a pastry (keep it authentic with a traditional cinnamon roll). And, as is common in most places here with outdoor space, if it gets chilly you can help yourself to one of the blankets piled up at the door.</p> <p>Then stroll down towards the heart of Helsinki along the shore; the beach is popular with joggers and picnickers. On your left will be <strong> Sibelius Park</strong> (Sibeliuksen puisto) with its futuristic tubular steel sculpture in memory of the famous Finnish composer.</p> <p>Make your way inland at the base of the park and wander towards Helsinki's main thoroughfare, <strong> Mannerheimintie</strong>. On the far side there's a small lake with a waterside walkway and a bicycle lane: as the city is so flat and designated paths abound, a bike is a pleasant way to get about. Pick up a basic Citybike at one of 26 stands in town for a deposit of \u20ac2, much like hiring a shopping trolley.</p> <p>En route, marvel at the 1970s <strong> Finlandia House</strong> (Finlandia huset) designed by Finland's favourite architect Alvar Aalto (he of the famous wiggly vase and bendy wooden chairs). Then move on to the curved concrete and glass magnificence of the <strong> Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art</strong> (Mannerheiminaukio 2, +1733 6501, \u20ac5.50, see <a href=\"http://www.kiasma.fi\">kiasma.fi</a>).</p> <p><strong> Lunch</strong><br></p> <p>There are many tempting places to stop and refuel particularly on the broad, grassy <strong> Etelaesplanadi</strong> and the tree-lined <strong> Bulevardi</strong>, a photogenic cliche of what a traditional European street ought to look like. But for a glimpse of old-school Helsinki, it has to be artsy <strong> Caf\u00e9 Engel</strong> (Aleksanterinakatu 26, +0965 2776). Choose a window seat - and admire the pastel-painted buildings including the domed <strong> Tuomiokirkko Lutheran cathedral</strong> - or the little walled garden out the back where independent films are screened in the evenings.</p> <p><strong> Shopping and culture</strong><br></p> <p>Design fans should head to the area roughly south of the Etelaesplanadi and Bulevardi. <strong> Hundpark</strong> (Albertinkatu 46, +41482 9941) is bursting with young, cutting-edge fashion talent, while <strong> IVANAhelsinki</strong> (Uudenmaankatu 15, +50347 6131), blends rustic canvas chic with cute prints. Don't miss, too, the shop attached to tiny, maverick art-gallery-in-a-basement <strong> Myym\u00e4l\u00e42 </strong> (Uudenmaankatu 23, +40 723 4765). Browse badges, fanzines, T-shirts, handmade bags and thrift store customisation alongside some fairly unusual works of art. <strong> Nanso </strong> (Mikonkatu 2) specialises in the kinds of bold, modern prints that famous Finnish label Marimekko began in the 50s. Talking of which, <strong> Marimekko</strong> (+9 170 704) has two stores on the Etelaesplanadi. And<strong> The Moomin Shop </strong> (K\u00e4mp Galleria, Pohjoisesplanadi 33, +10 304 0100) is pretty hard to resist.</p> <p>For interiors, check out <strong> Artek </strong> (Etel\u00e4sesplanadi 18, +9 6132 5277), founded by Alvar Aalto. A brilliant exhibition devoted to the designer runs until the end of September at the <strong> Design Museum</strong> (Korkeavuorenkatu 23, +9 622 0540).</p> <p>Not up for shopping? Then make your way through the bustling <strong> Kauppatori </strong> market square on the harbourside (stopping for a freshly caught snack as you go) and to the far end of the quay. Bypass the tourist boats crossing to <strong> Suomenlinnaan</strong> (suomenlinna .fi/english) and find the Helsinki City Transport ferry, which is around half the price. The former island fortress now houses museums, cafes and a small population of wealthy Finns.</p> <p><strong> Evening</strong><br></p> <p>Back on the mainland, chill with a drink in the early evening sunshine on the Etelaesplanadi-facing terrace of <strong> Hotel K\u00e4mp</strong> (see below for details). Especially if you can't afford to stay there. The 19th-century five-star establishment - once a haunt of Sibelius and his boho buddies - has a rather fabulous cigar and champagne bar. Glasses start at \u20ac13.50.</p> <p><strong> Where to eat and drink</strong><br></p> <p>Helsinki is more cosmopolitan than you might expect on the food front. But for traditional Finnish fare, \u20ac15-\u20ac30 at the cosy <strong> Lappi</strong> (Annankatu 22, +645 550) will get you a plate of everything from reindeer to elk. If that's just a little too authentic, try <strong> Via</strong> (Ludviginkatu 8-10, +9 6811 3714), run by TV chef Jyrki Sukula. Food is fresh, simple and light - mains around \u20ac18, wine from \u20ac28.</p> <p>Head to <strong> Mother Bar n' Kitchen</strong> (Eerikinkatu 2, 09 612 3990) for a post-dinner drink and dance in deeply designer surrounds. For something a touch less Hoxton, you'll find more of Helsinki's young hedonists squished on to the intimate dancefloor at <strong> We Got Beef</strong> (Roobertinkatu 21). At this time of night, Helsinki doesn't feel so sparsely populated.</p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br></p> <p><strong> Hotel Kamp </strong> (Pohjoisesplanadi 29, +9 576 111, <a href=\"http://www.hotelkamp.fi\">hotelkamp.fi</a>) is the most marvellous, luxurious place. Brace yourself for the prices though, which start at \u20ac365 for a deluxe room, and go up to \u20ac2,750 for the Mannerheim suite, excluding breakfast. At the freshly refurbished and equally historic <strong> Hotel Torni</strong> (Yrj\u00f6nkatu 26, +9 131 131) doubles cost from \u20ac210 B&amp;B.</p> <p>For something quieter, try the cosy <strong> Klaus Kurki</strong> (Bulevardi 2-4, +9 43340, <a href=\"http://www.sokoshotels.fi\">sokoshotels.fi</a>), doubles from \u20ac104 B&amp;B.

  "<p>After protracted correspondence with a reader recently on an issue not resolved entirely to his satisfaction he asked me how he could invoke the Guardian's complaints procedure. I explained that he had both invoked and exhausted it. Should not the procedure have been explained to him at the outset, he asked.</p> <p>We do our best. On every day the Guardian is published, we advertise my presence in a note that appears with the corrections and clarifications column on the leader page of the paper. In addition, these Open door columns, which usually discuss complaints or issues raised by readers, have appeared practically every week for the past seven years. In that time more than 50,000 readers have found me and we have carried almost 10,000 notes in the corrections and clarifications column.</p> <p>There is a link to my page on the website from the information section at the bottom right of the home page. Clicking on Guardian readers' editor gives you a selection of recent columns, an article explaining what I do, and my terms of reference. These make it clear that my main task is to deal impartially with complaints about the Guardian's journalism, in practice both in print and online.</p> <p>I have explained before that my contract guarantees my independence from the editor and his staff. He cannot veto subjects I wish to write about or interfere with what I write. If he wished to end my contract before its term had run he would have to refer to the owner of the Guardian, the Scott Trust (on which he sits).</p> <p>To come back to the reader to whom I referred at the beginning. Shortly before I became readers' editor the Guardian appointed an external ombudsman to whom complainants could refer if they wished to go to an external figure or if they were dissatisfied with my conclusions. Several people a year did that. No complaints about my conclusions were upheld.</p> <p>For the time being, the position of external ombudsman is vacant. This means that those who are dissatisfied with any adjudication by me are left with two practical avenues: they can go to the Press Complaints Commission (<a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk\">www.pcc.org.uk</a>) or they can go to their lawyer. </p> <p>The website of the PCC explains clearly how to complain and also gives the latest version of the code of practice, any breach of which the commission will consider. Like all other newspapers in the UK, the Guardian is signed up to the code and in fact incorporates it in its own editorial code (you can find that, too, on my page of the Guardian website, address below).</p> <p>To explain how it might work, a reader who felt that I had unreasonably declined to correct, say, some significant error of fact could ask the PCC to consider the matter under clause 1 of the code: accuracy. Once a reader goes to the PCC, I play no further part in the matter. The PCC then deals with the managing editor of the Guardian.</p> <p>It is not a part of my brief to defend the Guardian. I reject many complaints. Rejecting a complaint, however, is not defending the Guardian; but I would argue that dealing with a complaint openly and fairly is defending the Guardian, even when the conclusion goes against it.</p> <p>If a complainant goes to law the complaint is dealt with by the Guardian's legal affairs department. Only a tiny proportion of those complaining take either of these courses. The vast majority of those complaining to my department find the service quick, effective and free.</p> <p>Much is done inside the paper to make journalists aware of the concerns of readers. The assistant readers' editor compiles a weekly account of traffic through the office, which is circulated to all journalists and a number of others by email. It is shortly to be posted on the company intranet, which will give it even wider circulation within the organisation.</p> <p>A colleague on the website also circulates a weekly illustrated summary of reader or user queries to Guardian Unlimited. All emails to my office are drawn to the attention of the relevant journalist or department; and all emails to the readers' editor are in a queue open to be read by all staff journalists on the Guardian at their desks. We reply to many but not all emails.</p> <p>All of these things have helped to create a different relationship between readers and writers, one that is still developing. To return once more to the reader at the beginning: we shall adopt his suggestion of referring more frequently to my page on the website where all, or nearly all, is explained.</p> <p>Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning <strong>0845 451 9589</strong> (UK only, calls charged at local rate) or <strong>+44 (0)20 7713 4736</strong> between 11am and 5pm UK time Monday to Friday excluding UK bank holidays.<br> <strong>Mail</strong> to Readers' editor, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, UK.<br> <strong>Fax</strong> +44 (0)20 7239 9997.<br> <a href=\"mailto:reader@theguardian.com\">reader@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Jumping through the hurdles and costs of buying abroad is only the first problem for British buyers in Italy. Even more difficult is keeping control of building costs when you are in a foreign country.</p> <p>Once you have decided whether to employ a local or a home architect, the next important decision is your choice of \"geometra\". He or she is part chartered surveyor, part on-site foreman and general engineer. </p> <p>The geometra will steer you through planning permissions and help find a team of local builders. He will know local suppliers of stones, marble, wood and whatever else needed to do up your house. </p> <p>Ask in your local town or village who is well-regarded - the person with the best reputation usually has it for a good reason. </p> <p>The geometra will draw up a list of the work that has to be done. This list may run to 20 pages. Get out your dictionary and start translating the headings. It is a lot of work but not difficult and it is essential that you understand this document. </p> <p>He will distribute the list to three or four local builders and ask them for a preventivo - an estimate. Expect to pay him or her 10% of the cost of the project in fees. </p> <p>Your next task is to speak to the builder and ask him to take you to a current site to establish whether is it tidy and well-ordered? If you can, interview the builder's previous clients so much the better. Ask whether their project came in on time and on budget? </p> <p>It is normal in Italy to put down a deposit of 10%-30% before the work starts, and to then make payments every month or two - although a penalty clause should be inserted into the contract that deducts an agreed amount if the builder fails to complete on schedule. </p> <p>When dealing with the price for renovation, strike a hard bargain - but not a mean one. Haggle, but not too much, and make it clear from the outset, that if they uncover any new problems you must be informed immediately and they must clear any extra costs with you. </p> <p>All work on properties in Italy is subject to IVA (VAT) at 10% on restoration and restructuring and 20% on the purchase of building materials. If you part-pay in cash, you can save this percentage. This is widespread practice but it relies on you trusting your building team. </p> <p>Once the work is completed you will have to make any last payments. It is stan dard practice to hold back the final 10% for a few months in case any problems emerge. </p> <p>If small things go wrong within two years, such as window leaks, the builder has to come back and fix it. You generally have a ten-year guarantee for big jobs such as a new roof. Check that this is all in your building contract. </p> <p>Finally, it's worth noting that restoring a home in Italy or in any other foreign country is undoubtedly one of the most stressful things you can do - but it can be fun, too. </p> <p>Don't agree to anything you do not understand but be brave and keep your nerve. It will all be worth it when you finally sit on you terrace with that long-awaited glass of wine. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Barbara McMahon is the author of Buying Property in Italy, published by Kogan-Page, price \u00a39.99.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Lap of luxury on Skye</strong></p> <p>It never ceases to amaze me how many entrepreneurs decorate these shores with cool places to stay. Skeabost (Norse for sheltered house or haven) on Skye is a 19th-century shooting lodge whose location is steeped in ancient lore. A guesthouse in the 1950s, it had also been home to one Duncan Macleod, supplier of fine amber liquid to prohibition-era America. Now it is owned by Helen Myers, former blues festival organiser, who has remodelled the place, restoring the Scots pine panelling, installing huge freestanding baths and fashioning 17 rooms and suites individually adorned in pale under-statement or sumptuous shades.

  "Alex Salmond broke the habit of a political lifetime yesterday when he surprised no one by securing the Scottish National party leadership he once resigned and had only recently vowed never to seek again. <p>Despite Mr Salmond not being a member of the Scottish parliament, more than three-quarters of the party faithful decided that he was the right person to lead them. He will have to do so from exile in Westminster until he can find a seat at Holyrood. </p> <p>The opening words of the SNP's new leader and one-time reluctant Lazarus were succinct: \"Well folks, it's good to be back.\" They marked one of the most unexpected comebacks in Scottish political history, and what his supporters hope will be a sea change in fortunes for his languishing party. </p> <p>With 76% of the vote, Mr Salmond, 49, roundly defeated his fellow contestants. Of the 6,654 votes cast - a turnout of 80% - Roseanna Cunningham, the only MSP to stand, secured 10% while Mike Russell secured the rest. There was no doubting the decisiveness of Mr Salmond's victory. \"Mike and I got well stuffed,\" said Ms Cunningham. </p> <p>A victory in the contest for the deputy leader, Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Salmond's key ally and running mate, will allow her to take control of the parliamentary party at Holyrood while Mr Salmond fights Labour in the forthcoming general election from his base as MP for Banff and Buchan. </p> <p>As he gave his acceptance speech at the foot of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, just across from the new \u00a3431m parliament building, Mr Salmond was in fighting mood. \"Nicola and I intend to win the 2007 elections and we will do that by offering avision to the people where currently there is a vacuum,\" he said. </p> <p>But there can be no doubt that he finds the party in a difficult position as he returns to the post he stunned members by resigning from in 2000. John Swinney, his successor and now predecessor as leader, was generally considered to be a decent and likeable politician, but he lacked charisma and was forced to resign earlier this year after a poor show by the SNP in the European elections. </p> <p>It has fewer MSPs than when Mr Salmond resigned. It failed to flourish under the devolution settlement, and tensions remain between its fundamentalist wing, which seeks all-out campaigning for independence, and Mr Salmond's gradualist approach, which believes devolution should be a stepping stone to independence. </p> <p>Mr Salmond will have to face down the internal backbiting and sniping which led to the resignation of his good friend Mr Swinney. </p> <p>Until he can secure a Holyrood seat he also remains vulnerable to the charge of \"absentee laird\". It was one of the first allegations he sought to put down yesterday. </p> <p>\"I led the SNP for 10 years as a member of the Westminster parliament and no one ever thought I was leading it from London,\" he said. \"I will be leading it from around Scotland - every nook and cranny, every village and town and city - as we rouse this nation to make progress next year and secure victory in 2007, and then on to Scottish independence.\" </p> <p>Whatever else he brings to the SNP leadership, he is sure to return some colour to the often grey Scottish political scene. Since the death of Donald Dewar, he is perhaps the only nationally recognised figure of Scottish political life - and he is a politician prepared to take risks. </p> <p><b> Expelled</b><br> </p> <p>He has been a member of the SNP since 1973 and joined the national executive committee in 1981. He was, however, briefly expelled from it in 1981 over his membership of the 79 Group, a radical leftwing group he helped to form after a poor SNP showing in the 1979 general election. He became the SNP MP for Banff and Buchan in 1987, the year in which he also became the party's deputy leader. In 1990, he was elected leader and is widely credited with transforming the SNP from a fringe party into the main opposition party north of the border. </p> <p>Never one to shy from confrontation, Mr Salmond was thrown out of the Commons in 1988 for interrupting the chancellor's budget speech to protest at the guinea-pig introduction to Scotland of the poll tax. He also set himself apart from the political fray in 1999 when he condemned Nato's intervention in Kosovo as \"unpardonable folly\". </p> <p>In the first elections to the Scottish parliament in 1999, he was accused by his critics of fighting a lacklustre campaign. But it was the party's best ever parliamentary performance, winning 35 seats in the 129-seat parliament. </p> <p>Mr Salmond is well known as a racing tipster; until recently the bookmakers would have given long odds on him returning to the SNP leadership. The party faithful, however, obviously now see him as a safe bet.</p>",
  "<p>After the unbearable tedium of the European Championship (the fact that the final was an exact replay - Greece v Portugal - of the opening game put the redundancy of most of the intervening ones beyond doubt), this enthusiast approached the Athens Olympics with a sense of weary duty. I wondered if I still had the hunger, the discipline, to sit through the gruelling schedule of late-night medal ceremonies and reruns of races that I'd already watched a dozen times. To be honest, there were moments, before it all started, when I considered hanging up the remote.</p> <p>Such doubts proved short-lived as the games got off to the best possible start with an unscheduled, possibly even mythic event: the mixed doubles motorcycle sprint time trial and road race. Only one team took part but the rumour, eventually confirmed, that \"the Greek pair\" - as Kostas Kederis and Katerina Thanou became contemptuously known - had ended up in hospital provided the first twist in a series of engrossing stories within the all-consuming narrative of the games. We expected this one to conform to an established template: outright denial followed by qualified admission (\"It was the cough mixture!\") leading to eventual confession (\"I was so full of pills that I rattled\"). As it turned out, though, our craving for justice was simultaneously satisfied and thwarted by the story's non-denouement. By handing in their accreditation the Greek athletes denied us definitive closure. This was all the more palpable since, in every other way, the modern games have sought to eliminate uncertainty. The technology of the photo finish is so finely calibrated as to make the idea of a dead heat seem an archaic residue of the failings of the human eye. Even if the three Kenyan steeplechasers had tried to cross the line together they would have been shown to have done so successively.</p> <p>In other events (the gymnastics, most controversially), without the adjudicating support of technology, sportsmen and women are constantly outstripping our ability to assess what they are doing. This did not, at first, appear to be the problem with Team GB, who left us contemplating the not unfamiliar prospect of serial humiliation in event after event. In those early days the Acropolis loomed above the traffic, as Don DeLillo puts it in The Names, \"like some monument to doomed expectations\". Things ended up rather nicely - climaxing with the alchemical surge of the final Saturday - but one of the defining moments of the games was, of course, the catastrophic meltdown suffered by Paula Radcliffe in the marathon.</p> <p>Victory and triumph over adversity (as supremely achieved - twice - by Kelly Holmes) are uplifting, but defeat and failure can be utterly transfixing, too. The nature of the race and the unique demands it makes on participants meant that what happened to Radcliffe lay beyond the usual qualifier that \"on the day\" Mizuki Noguchi was the better runner. This was not just long-distance Henmanism; it was an encounter with destiny in the form of a series of intensely compressed, incremental realisations.</p> <p>When Elfenesh Alemu went past her, Radcliffe realised that not only would she not win gold but that she was out of the medals. As soon as she realised this it became clear that there was no point even finishing - which meant that she was finished. Athletes often talk of hitting the wall. Radcliffe had been through that wall so often she didn't know it was there. And then, weirdly, the road itself had become a wall and it was all around her and there was no end to it in sight. It was like watching someone having a complete crack-up before your eyes. As such it made superb television. (The grassy verge on which she ended up even lent a Zapruderish touch to the footage.) Athletes deny nine-tenths of themselves so that they can pack the remaining tenth with incredible intensity and purpose. While plenty of people succumb to the urge to give up (going to the gym, trying to be an artist), it goes pretty much unnoticed. But for Radcliffe this was both a public and complete ontological collapse. And it happened, let's not forget, on the very day that that icon of modern despair, Edvard Munch's The Scream was stolen. Who needs art when you've got sport?</p> <p>Tears of one kind or another were everywhere in evidence at these games. Enough were shed on my sofa to leave me repeatedly and blurrily amazed by sport's capacity to reach depths of emotion that used to be regarded as the preserve of high art. The American novelist Andrew Holleran is right: most of the time \"tears on TV are like the come shot in a porn film\". At a time when our responses to everything - especially so-called tragedy - are consistently being cheapened, coarsened and, preprogrammed, sport accesses some zone of shared feeling that remains mysterious in spite of the familiarity of the clich\u00e9s by which it is routinely articulated. Wordsworth claimed to have thoughts that lay \"too deep for tears\" but the tears that left Matthew Pinsent a quaking hulk on the podium came from so far within they were practically chthonic.</p> <p>Moving though that was, what really got to me were the comments from Barney Williams of the Canadian crew who said that being \"part of one of the most exciting races of all time [was] as stimulating as winning a gold medal by three or four seconds\". The majority of the occasions that left me blubbing involved some display of sportsmanship like this: when the decathletes, shattered by their exertions of the last 36 hours embraced each other; when the beaten Bernard Lagat shared El Guerrouj's joy at winning the 1500 metres that had eluded him for so long.</p> <p>By contrast, the idea that winning is the only thing has become so entrenched in football as to render the sport abhorrent as often as it is thrilling (it was also one of the reasons why the Euros ended up being such a bore). Two days after the games began Jimmy Floyd Hasellbaink scored a goal against Newcastle with his hand, thereby making a nonsense of the whole game (it's not called football for nothing). Again and again in the course of the games we were reminded not simply of the rightness of the Olympic ideal that taking part is glorious in itself, but that this quaint idea might actually enhance the greater glory of winning. (Perhaps, to put it more cynically, the great virtue of the games is that the cheating takes place offstage, invisibly, chemically.)</p> <p>The joy of taking part holds good irrespective of the perceived worth or silliness of the sport in question. There is always a great deal of debate about whether minor sports deserve to be included. On the evidence of these games, the debate should be whether the big ones need to be excluded. The results suggest that, for leading tennis players and football teams alike, an Olympic gold medal, far from being the ultimate prize, is an international equivalent of the League Cup (or whatever it is now called). The sports that work best are those for which the Olympics are the unquestioned summit of exposure, recognition and achievement.</p> <p>Take badminton, for example. The badminton rocked! A million miles away from the dreamy country house idyll of David Inshaw's lovely painting in Tate Britain, the semi-finals of the mixed doubles had an intensity to rival that seen in any sport. It was the intensity of concentration that was especially marked and this, I suspect, is another reason why I and so many other people found some of the less visually rewarding events so engrossing. Attention deficit seems less like a disorder, more a glimpse of the next stage of human evolution. There will come a time when the ability to concentrate on anything for more than a few minutes will appear as mysterious as a Vermeer. In the meantime we have those photographs of table tennis players, fixing their attention on a white ball floating in the middle of their foreheads like a bubble of pure thought.</p> <p>Sorry, where was I? Oh, right, the so-called minor sports ... That's another thing that always amazes about the Olympics: how interesting it is to watch sports in which one has no interest and which one has never even considered playing. I draw the line at basketball (an \"armpit sport\" as DeLillo calls it) but I really like watching sports I would hate to have to play. Hockey, for instance: a game that involves so much stooping that getting a puck in the teeth actually comes as a relief from the chronic pain in your lower back. For back pain, though, the gold medal has to go to the weightlifters. I loved watching the weightlifters (though while doing so I was often and unfortunately reminded of Craig Raine's line about dogs who \"shit like weightlifters\"), especially the super-heavyweights, lifting really super-heavy weights. Can you imagine trying to do that? The breakfasts alone - 20 eggs, a dozen steaks - would have been enough to kill me, but as a spectacle it was utterly addictive, watching the bar bend under the weight, wondering if someone might actually burst before your eyes. I also found it strangely soothing to turn on the TV and find Ben Ainslie - an Ahab in the era of down-sizing and cost-efficiency - duking it out in some endless and, as far as one could determine, fiercely one-sided battle against the cruel sea. It was good to know that he was out there and, for me at least, he still is. We will come back to this.</p> <p>Some of these minor sports would undoubtedly benefit from a change of costume. It is extraordinary that the judo jacket has remained unchanged for so long since the participants have to spend so much of their energy wrestling it back into some kind of order. The show jumping would be more fun if the participants dressed like cowboys and jumped over bits of abandoned wagon trains. In other sports a more radical overhaul is needed. Archery would be improved if the archers were shooting at moving targets: antelope maybe, possibly human beings, ideally (and this would really make a sport of it) each other. Come to that, why not combine three-day eventing, trap shooting and archery and just call it Cowboys and Indians?</p> <p>The most compelling events, though, need no dressing up because they have such a naked connection to their biological origins: the ability to run away from or catch up with something or someone; to jump over a yawning chasm or river; to swim across a lake. (The corollary of this is that it's difficult to imagine a scenario in which the triple jump might be of use. Stepping stones in a wide stream, perhaps?) One might go further and say that an event's pulling power is directly linked to the stage at which it emerged as a human activity. After running, jumping and swimming came throwing, fighting, gymnastics (or tumbling anyway) and all the equine stuff pioneered by the Mongol hordes or some such. Eventually you got the invention of the ball (as significant in its way as the invention of the wheel) and, as we became adept at using and making tools, so we saw the development of racket sports, the pressurised tennis ball, Air Jordans and so forth. The primal origin of the basic athletic events means that, give or take a few details, they are pretty well unaltered by technological refinement. Plutarch might have been writing for the Guardian sports pages when he wrote of \"men who, for deftness of hand, speed of legs, and strength of muscle, transcended human nature and were tireless\".</p> <p>And what could be more basic - what could be more grounded in the make-up of the species - than our love-hate relationship with what we now know to be gravity. There's no point making light of it: the Olympics would be nothing without gravity, especially those events in which, as Bob Dylan put it, they're all doing their best to deny it. A certain number of falls - sacrifices, I suppose you could call them - is essential to the spell of gymnastics: they remind us that, in the course of almost every manoeuvre, the bar or beam is regained against all odds (and how lovely it is to see the coaches of the gymnasts on the bars, standing by, ready to catch them should they fall). What in the Bible was termed a miracle is now known as a Ginga. The extreme degree of difficulty that characterises the performances pervades every aspect of gymnastics.</p> <p>Photography, which does so well by other sports (the intense temporal concentration of the sprints, for example, finds an exact equivalent in the visual compression of the telephoto lens) has great difficulty isolating the split-second of weightlessness which is, quite literally, the highpoint of many gymnastic moves. (The problem, paradoxically, is the ease with which fast shutter speeds render any instant weightless.) We, in turn, have great difficulty judging what we are seeing - and so, it seems, did the judges. The reason for this is tangled up in the idea of perfection. In The Marriage Of Cadmus And Harmony, Roberto Calasso writes that \"Perfection doesn't explain its own history but offers its completion.\" This is not true of gymnastics. Gymnastics gives us a glimpse of perfection - but every time it does so it instantly raises the bar of the possible (how about throwing in another half-twist?), thereby postponing the idea of completion. It is also constantly commenting on its own history, quoting from the great previous masters and the moves - the Katchev, the Korbut - named after them. (This form of worship has reached its most extreme, monotheistic tendency elsewhere, in the high jump, or the Fosbury as it has now, effectively, become.)</p> <p>We will, as they say in sports broadcasting, return to the gymnastics shortly, but let us first concede what has become increasingly obvious over the past decade: that the Olympics are, along with everything else, a great festival of Eros. Whatever your preferred body type or sexual orientation there is someone here to fixate on. Among my women friends there seemed almost no consensus as to which events worked best for them. Quite a few felt that no one on the track could rival the laid-back sexual magnetism of the man in the commentary box. No, not Jonathan Edwards - Michael Johnson. Some liked the sprinters; others found them too muscle-bound, an opinion widely denounced by male gay friends who expressed widespread disappointment that, in the pool, amphibious, dolphin-grey speed suits had taken over from what Alan Hollinghurst, in The Line of Beauty, terms \"knob-flaunting Speedos\". Their interests were better served by the synchronised divers and, of course, by the male gymnasts. Edmund White recalls how, in the 1970s, intensive workouts left him with forearms the girth of a horse's withers, a \"waist as slender as a napkin\", and a \"butt as imposing as a diva's bosom\". The problem was that he became so muscle-bound he could no longer scratch his back or peel off a T-shirt. The bodybuilder's goal is appearance not action. It was only when watching the gymnasts do something almost mortal - applying chalk, tying on wrist supports or packing their bags - that the quotidian superfluousness of their arms really became apparent. On the apparatus those boulders of muscle on arms and shoulders represented the minimum size necessary to perform the super-heroics demanded by the sport.</p> <p>As for my old-fashioned hetero self, it's the leggy jumpers that have done it for me. (Oh lucky sand to have had Heike Drechsler landing in it for all those years.) This time around it was the women's beach volleyball that was the unquestioned erotic epicentre of the games. The sexual element is latent in the word \"beach\" but even here it was both intended and incidental. That's the great thing about it. The athletes are not using their perfect bodies just to model all that Lycra - and that makes it even sexier.</p> <p>The killer is that we'll have to wait another four years to live through all this again. Because it's over. It's over - and the thought of that is too much to bear. For those few weeks in August our lives were packed with meaning and purpose (get home and watch the Olympics - or, in my case, since I was at home already, just watch the Olympics). It was great watching the old faces (Svetlana Khorkina, the tragic diva of the asymmetric bars; Frankie Fredericks looking like he had been running since the dawn of time) and it was great watching the new faces (Jeremy Wariner springing to the front of the 400 metres like sprinting's answer to Eminem) but it was actually great just watching. We spent half the day watching and a lot of the next morning reading about what we had watched and, as a result, we felt ... fulfilled. One day led perfectly to the next. We were never bored and even if we were bored at least there was something on telly. How did we get by without it? What are we going to do without it? How are we going to survive until \"the youth of the world\" - a swelling bit of oratory from the closing ceremony that always brings a tear to the eye - gather again in Beijing? For the moment all I can do is think of Ben Ainslie. I like to think he's still out there somewhere, doing battle against the waves, like some Japanese soldier of the second world war, refusing to admit defeat, refusing to admit that it's over.</p>",

  "<p>Back from a fabulous holiday in Italy, marvelled at low property prices and thinking about buying a casa rustico? Well think again - a change in the UK's money laundering legislation may thwart the dreams of British buyers. </p> <p>At stake is a very Italian problem. Buyers of property in the country traditionally face two prices - the official or \"declared\" price on which taxes are levied - and the real price, usually a lot higher. </p> <p>All property purchases in Italy are handled by a publicly-paid notary, who traditionally leaves the room for a few moments at the point when the official price is agreed. Two sets of documents are then drawn up - the publicly declared price, and the real one. </p> <p>Both buyer and seller then pay the various (and many) taxes on the declared value - which is typically 70% of the real value. So, anybody buying a house for \u00a3100,000 would declare it for tax purposes at a price of \u00a370,000. It is the vendor who pays the majority of the taxes, so they are keen to keep the declared price low. </p> <p>In Italy, this practice causes solicitors only mild concern. It is considered normal practice - indeed, under declaring the house's value is not an offence in Italy - although the authorities are now trying to raise declared values closer to the actual price paid. </p> <p>But for a British buyer, it poses a serious dilemma. If you want to use a UK solicitor - and many people will - he or she cannot ignore the real price. If they did so, they would be breaching new UK money laundering rules, which prohibit lawyers from aiding clients to evade tax, even in another country. </p> <p>One answer to this problem for UK buyers is to declare the full value, and to pay the extra taxes. And for a few vendors this will not present a problem. They are probably charging UK buyers a premium price, which will cover the extra tax that they will have to pay. </p> <p>However, if the person you are buying from has owned the property for less than five years, they are required to pay capital gains tax on any increase in the home's value. If they under declared when they bought the property, they won't want to pay tax on the full price - and in all likelihood won't sell to someone who won't do the same. </p> <p>Equally, anyone looking to buy a new build from a de veloper will hardly be welcomed with open arms at the show home, if they insist on a full value declaration. </p> <p>J&amp;M contacted several lawyers specialising in acting for UK buyers looking to purchase in Italy and almost all said the recent changes meant they now (officially) advise clients to declare the full price. </p> <p>One even said he would report any client who tried to under declare, but another said it was still possible to buy from the UK and under declare - in fact, one notary recently insisted upon it. </p> <p>Some have got round the problem by sending the purchase money as several smaller amounts rather than one lump sum, which should attract less interest from the authorities. </p> <p>It should be pointed out that under declaring its not without its risks. Anyone caught seriously under declaring is liable to a fine and to paying the avoided taxes. </p> <p>Also if the house is compulsorily purchased or the subject of any other legal action, you will only be entitled to the declared value in compensation. Lastly, there is nothing to stop you hiring a local lawyer to act on your behalf, although that could present other difficulties. </p> <p>Like we said, it could only happen in Italy.</p>",
  "<p>As he looks back on two international campaigns and forward to a third which begins with tonight's World Cup qualifying match in Vienna, Sven-Goran Eriksson sees only one barrier to England's progress. Asked yesterday what lessons he had learnt from his team's failure to reach the last four in Japan two years ago and in Portugal this summer, he went straight for the factor over which he has no control. </p> <p>\"We lost a quarter-final twice,\" he said, \"and my way of seeing it is to look at how we lost. We were almost there. So between us and the best teams in Europe and the world, the difference is very little. The biggest thing for me to do is to try and have this squad as fit as possible for the next World Cup, because I think that was our biggest problem in those two tournaments.\" </p> <p>Outsiders, including fans and journalists, tend to look for other explanations behind England's failure to hold on to the lead in important games. Looking at the similarities between the three defeats in competitive matches under Eriksson, they sense a pattern. And what it suggests is that the Swede, who arrived in international football at the age of 52, may be too steeped in the long cadence of a league season, based on the steady accumulation of points, to handle the demands of the sudden-death matches that determine the outcome of big tournaments. </p> <p>While guiding England through a qualification phase, picking up points here and there and masterminding a shut-out in Istanbul, he looks the ideal leader. Earlier this week, during a passionate defence of Eriksson's stewardship, Gary Neville praised the air of calm he had brought to a squad formerly bereft of certainties. But the need to improvise in reaction to a changing situation might require another kind of instinct, something that was not in evidence in Shizuoka or Lisbon. </p> <p>\"I don't see any pattern there,\" Eriksson said yesterday, briskly bypassing the issue and preferring to concentrate on the problems created by the question of fitness. The matter was raised when David Beckham and Michael Owen chose to confirm the suspicions of those who believe they played in Portugal despite the existence of physical problems, contradicting Eriksson's many assurances that the squad arrived for the tournament in the best possible condition. </p> <p>What some see as pragmatism and others as weakness emerged at yesterday's press conference during an answer to the criticism that he is reluctant to take harsh decisions when confronted by the evidence of key players such as Beckham and Steven Gerrard falling below maximum effectiveness. Beckham, after all, had also played in Japan while not even 90% fit. </p> <p>\"You can't say that David Beckham and Steven Gerrard had a poor Euro,\" he responded. \"They were not as good as they could be, I agree to that. But when they are as good as they can be, they are among the best footballers in the world. I think they did a good job in Portugal, without being brilliant. And I agree that we need them to be brilliant to win the big matches and the big tournaments. But I can't find anyone better, even if they are only 90%.\" </p> <p>The contrast with Clive Woodward, who had no hesitation in temporarily dropping his captain, Martin Johnson, and got a match-winning performance out of the half-fit Jonny Wilkinson, appears stark. But direct comparisons take little account of the relative factors affecting the two men and their squads. Woodward was given more time with his players than Eriksson has ever been granted, including 20 training days a year not tied to specific matches. Nor were Woodward's side required to qualify for the last World Cup finals. And, after all, it took him six years to win rugby's supreme trophy, a few months longer than Eriksson will have been in the job by the time the 2006 football final comes around. </p> <p>Among other football managers with experience of sending out teams at both club and international level, Eriksson is seen to have done well in the face of a handicap shared by all who take on the role. </p> <p>\"The biggest thing that bothers international managers is call-offs,\" Craig Brown, the former Scotland manager, said this week. \"I'm seeing it happen this season already, players with bumps and bruises. There are big bonuses at stake in the Champions League, for instance, and with the best will in the world, there's going to be a conflict of interest.\" </p> <p>Mick McCarthy, who took the Republic of Ireland to Japan two years ago before returning to club management with Sunderland, remembers the problem of never really knowing the truth about players' condition during the domestic season. </p> <p>\"Sven isn't seeing them all the time,\" he said yesterday, \"so he can't know what problems they might be experiencing. On the other hand, the beauty of the situation is that any problems they might have with their clubs are left behind when they join the international squad. If you're not having the best time with your club, it can revitalise you.\" </p> <p>The new format of back-to-back matches also works to the international manager's advantage. \"You can sit down and talk about things properly,\" McCarthy pointed out, \"and maybe look at what went wrong in the Saturday game and try to do something about it for the Wednesday. It's hard to get players to look at a video of something they did six weeks ago. They'll probably have played 10 games for their clubs since then.\" </p> <p>Rather than concentrate on England's significant defeats, McCarthy prefers to point out the narrow margin between success and failure. \"Sven's record must be as good as anyone's over the last few years. He's done fantastically well. Bad luck and bad decisions, that's what costs you in these games. In Japan it was Beckham not going for a tackle because he thought the ball was going out, Scholes not trying to win it back because he was on a second caution, and a wondrous piece of finishing. Against Portugal it was having what was clearly a good goal disallowed. It's just the final hurdle, that's all.\" </p> <p>Brown agreed. \"England have good players,\" he said. \"Eriksson is privileged in that regard. He just needs them to stay fit. Then, with a wee break, England will be there.\" </p> <p>Eriksson said much the same yesterday while responding with mild exasperation to a suggestion that, having won nothing for almost 40 years, England can no longer be counted among the big football nations. </p> <p>\"If you talk about England in other countries,\" he said, \"I'm sure the respect is huge - much more than it is in England, in fact, especially if you read the press. We reached the quarter-finals twice and lost by nothing, more or less. We beat Argentina, we beat Germany, and you're saying that we're not a big football country? I can't agree to that.\" </p> <p>And as he begins what could be the final phase of his time with England, has his own determination survived the varied disappointments of the past 3 years? </p> <p>\"Of course,\" he said. \"My dream is the same as your dream.\" </p> <p> <strong>Sven-Goran Eriksson's competitive record with England </strong></p> <p>P23 W15 D5 L3 </p> <p>World Cup qualifier</p> <p>England 2 Finland 1 </p> <p>England recovered from a Gary Neville own-goal through Michael Owen and David Beckham, who capped an inspired display with a free-kick.</p> <p>Mar 28 2001</p> <p>World Cup qualifier Albania 1 England 3 </p> <p>Goals from Owen, Paul Scholes and Andy Cole - his only international goal - secured victory.

  "<p>Another day of prolonged activity at Newcastle United yesterday left the club still without a manager but with the chance of Terry Venables taking over receding. Birmingham's Steve Bruce remains Newcastle's preference. </p> <p>It is premature to reach conclusions in a scene that is ever changing but by yesterday afternoon the attraction of Venables appeared to be fading, at least as far as the chairman Freddy Shepherd and his powerful deputy Douglas Hall are concerned. </p> <p>Shepherd had publicly distanced himself from Venables on Thursday afternoon but sources close to Venables and at the club confirm there had been contact between Newcastle and the 61-year-old. </p> <p>One of Venables' plus points is that he is not currently working and would be available immediately but Shepherd's statement yesterday, that Newcastle are encountering a \"legal minefield\" in their approaches, suggests that Venables is no longer one of their principal targets. </p> <p>\"There's a legal minefield out there and we have to observe all the rules of the Premiership,\" Shepherd said, which seems to be a reference to Bruce and his five-year contract at Birmingham. \"We're talking to everyone we are legally entitled to and those who we feel merit our consideration. </p> <p>\"What we must not forget is that it is the future of Newcastle United which is at stake here, and the most important thing is to get the right man.\" </p> <p>Being correct rather than being quick is very much the framework within which Newcastle are operating as they seek to replace the sacked Sir Bobby Robson and the process is now destined to spread into next week. </p> <p>Bruce is in Portugal for a short holiday and despite his club's repeated announcements about loyalty and the contract he signed only a fortnight ago, it is understood that he is wavering due to Newcastle's persistence. </p> <p>\"I know the fans are impatient and I'm as impatient as they are,\" said Shepherd. \"But I've got to do what is best for Newcastle, not what is best for my popularity. We don't want any knee-jerk reaction and we cannot rush into anything. We're trying to do things correctly and professionally.\" </p> <p>To that end the club are determined to check out as many names as possible and assess whether the legal minefield will allow them to match their desired managerial profile: a young British disciplinarian. Martin O'Neill of Celtic, who came out the winner in two fans' polls this week, has still not been approached. </p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, meanwhile, rates Real Madrid as favourites for the Champions League but believes that the increasing Spanish influence at Arsenal will make his side a different force. \"All the teams from Spain will be strong,\" the Gunners manager said yesterday, after Uefa's elite coaches forum in Nyon, Switzerland. </p> <p>\"Barcelona have a very good side this season. Real Madrid have strengthened their defence, should be better at the back and have the players to compete in the Champions League. I also respect Jose Antonio Camacho as a coach; he's very competent. </p> <p>\"But they have not got Patrick Vieira, for the simple reason he changed his mind at the last minute without any pressure from us or anybody. Real Madrid usually get what they want but on this occasion it didn't work. At first Patrick Vieira wanted to go but then he changed his mind.\" </p> <p>Claudio Ranieri, also in Nyon in his capacity as coach of Valencia, nominated his previous club, Chelsea, among his choices to be European champions. \"The favourites are the same as usual,\" he said. \"Real Madrid, AC Milan, Manchester United, Arsenal but Chelsea too; they have a good team. We got to the semi-finals last season so why not?\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Middlesbrough's full-back <strong>Franck Queudrue</strong> has signed a one-year extension to his contract, taking him through to 2008. The Frenchman, 26 last week, had three seasons left to run of a five-year deal.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Clive Woodward is finally gone but he will not be forgotten at Twickenham in a hurry after an extraordinary farewell outburst yesterday in which he took deliberate aim at the heart of English rugby, condemning the Rugby Football Union as toothless and apathetic and accusing the union of complacency since England's World Cup triumph. </p> <p>On a day when vapour trails of vitriol flashed across the otherwise clear blue skies over south-west London, Woodward also laid into unsupportive Premiership club owners and directors of rugby for helping to push him into resigning from \"the best job in the world\" and confirmed he would be leaving rugby after next summer's Lions tour to New Zealand. </p> <p>His immediate plan is to divide his time between preparing for the Lions trip and studying for his Football Association grade two coaching award, although he will not be taking up any paid role awaiting him at Southampton until his Lions commitments are completed. In the meantime, however, he has stirred up a political hornet's nest of massive proportions and made an awful lot of people within English rugby very angry. </p> <p>According to Woodward, it was the endless club versus country rows and the decision to decrease the number of training days he is allowed with the national squad from 20 to 16 that lay at the heart of his decision to resign after seven years. \"I can't believe we've gone backwards since the World Cup,\" he stormed yesterday, recounting what he described as \"staggering\" meetings \"with the same old dull people\" after the World Cup. \"I was really hoping that after we'd won the World Cup someone would sit me down and say, 'OK, what do you want now?' But since we came back there's been a lot of apathy.\" </p> <p>Even more eye-watering was his complaint that prominent Premiership club figures - he named Bath's John Connolly and Wasps' Warren Gatland - had destabilised his regime. \"You can't control your players through 12 directors of rugby when three-quarters are from overseas and the rest want your job anyway. They're supposed to be working with me but there's no one in this organisation with the teeth to sort these people out. </p> <p>\"Gatland made a comment on the last tour. Connolly came out with something against me the other day. When directors of rugby sound off, there's only one person who cops it and that's me. I've had little or no support from the people I was representing. It's not easy dealing with some very strange characters who run the rugby clubs.\" </p> <p>There was more, much more, but the gist was that the RFU will struggle to win the 2007 World Cup unless they can get their players centrally contracted as happens elsewhere in the British Isles and much of the southern hemisphere. This argument, however, conveniently ignores the increasingly viable club set-up in England, and Wasps chairman Chris Wright was swift to criticise Woodward's scattergun attack. </p> <p>\"It is ridiculous for Clive to have a pop at us and I am fed up with it,\" said Wright. \"After England won the World Cup, he paid tribute to the clubs for helping provide the foundations: it can't be right then and wrong now, which makes me think there is more to his departure than meets the eye. </p> <p>\"Club owners put this show on the road by investing their resources and Clive has done well in terms of player release. We feel that the balance is right and rugby is not just about the England team - look at the crowds who turn up for club fixtures.\" </p> <p>Premier Rugby's Howard Thomas is equally peeved and is seeking urgent talks with Woodward's acting replacement. \"I would like to meet Andy Robinson as soon as possible to talk about the way forward,\" he said. \"We recognise that Clive's legacy is enormous but the English game is about more than just the national side. </p> <p>\"Clive ranted about his access to players, but if he follows the road to soccer he will quickly learn that compared to Sven-Goran Eriksson he was in the land of luxury. The top players spend 35% of their time with England, a far higher percentage than the likes of David Beckham do. Given all that Clive has achieved, I wish he had gone out with a smile on his face rather than sourly.\" </p> <p>Connolly did his best to be diplomatic, agreeing with Woodward that the elite player squad agreement governing England's top stars is flawed, but suggested any lack of co-operation was a matter of pots and kettles. '\"He has never contacted me or come to one of our training sessions and when I tried to call him last year to see how he saw Iain Balshaw's game developing, I never had any response. In contrast, Matt Williams of Scotland and Wales's Mike Ruddock regularly talk to me even though we only have one international from Scotland and one from Wales. </p> <p>\"The fact that I am not English does not mean I do not want England to succeed.

  "<p>Smiling and joking before the slaughter, Clive Woodward sauntered through a packed conference centre at Twickenham yesterday morning. He closed in on a table covered in a pristine white cloth with the amused look of a man who had already decided everything beyond which biscuit he might choose to accompany his first coffee on his last day of work. Woodward considered his options carefully before, steeling himself for his next elite performance, he passed on the digestives and the shortbread. Slipping one hand into a pocket and using the other to carry his cup, he ambled back into the throng of munching journalists. </p> <p>The usual way for a professional coach to tender his resignation, while launching an emotional attack on his erstwhile employers, is to prepare himself by remaining predictably tight-lipped and ashen-faced in some unseen office away from the hacks. Woodward, naturally, is different. He stopped to say hello or to give someone a wink while strolling from one small group of reporters to another. The outgoing England rugby coach gravitated easily to men who had shadowed him for the best, and worst, part of seven years. It was not a move inspired by Woodward's instinctive bonhomie. A starker intent was unfolding. Woodward had turned his back on his confused old masters. In the last five minutes before his gloves were removed he had decided to while away the time with the gang of messengers who would ensure that his extraordinary assault on the RFU would be heard and read by as many people as possible. </p> <p>Francis Baron and Graeme Cattermole, the RFU's chief executive and chairman, looked distinctly queasy when Woodward finally sat alongside them in an adjoining room. They knew they were about to be skewered and shafted. </p> <p>\"The two or three years leading up to the World Cup were fantastic,\" Woodward began in his deceptively affable way. \"We arrived at the World Cup as the best prepared team and we should be really proud of that. But since coming back from Australia I've been so disappointed. It was fantastic to win but literally from the moment the plane landed, after being in total control for the last couple of years, I just felt totally out of control.\" </p> <p>Baron and Cattermole stared blankly into the TV lights. They were being blamed for just about everything. \"When you lose [Martin] Johnson, [Lawrence] Dallaglio and [Neil] Back you just have to shake your head,\" Woodward said. \"When Dallaglio retired there were a lot of quotes from the RFU about what a great player he is. And they're right. He's a superstar but I didn't hear anyone saying 'Why? Why the hell has Lawrence Dallaglio retired when he's still playing for his club for two years?' That's when I start getting annoyed. The structure's wrong but I've been making this point for seven years. If it had been changed maybe Martin Johnson would still be playing for England. I find it very sad that that team has broken up so quickly. It all caught up with them. They had to stop for the sake of their families and their bodies. You have to make these statements and hope that people in the game listen to them.\" </p> <p>Baron and Cattermole looked ready to cover their ears and start screaming as Woodward blazed on. \"We beat the southern hemisphere teams, home and away, 12 times in a row. That's just awesome in terms of the history of English rugby. It was all going fantastically well. So why have we gone backwards? After all I've been through over the last seven years I just could not put up with that - sitting around the negotiating table with people who, with respect, have little or no idea about elite performance.\" </p> <p>Baron straightened his tie in some sort of diversionary performance while Cattermole blinked quickly and, presumably, in an elite kind of way. Woodward had eyes only for us. \"How can you prepare for a World Cup and be given 20 days and then come back as winners and be told that it is now 16? My mind-set is that it should be 22 or 24. I'm just amazed and saddened that people, whom I'm not going to name, in the clubs and the RFU, have taken us down this road.\" </p> <p>A few minutes later Woodward started naming some names - zeroing on his New Zealand and Australian coaching rivals, Warren Gatland and John Connolly, at Wasps and Bath. Cattermole finally responded with the effectiveness of the savaged sheep he had resembled all morning. \"If you try and change things overnight,\" he said, \"you're going to have major problems.\" </p> <p>He struggled through his seemingly problem-free morning. \"I gave Clive access to a management board meeting next week to present his vision - to talk directly as head coach to the board.\" </p> <p>Woodward's response was withering. \"Could I just thank the chairman for giving me access to the management board ...\" </p> <p>Reminded of Woodward's repeated accusation that the RFU is \"toothless\" and \"apathetic\", Cattermole pressed on blindly. \"Gentlemen, and ladies, that it is not the case.\" </p> <p>Paul Ackford, the former England lock forward turned rugby journalist, decided to even up the one-sided hammering. \"Do you think Clive has behaved like a spoilt brat?\" he asked. </p> <p>\"No,\" the old chairman gulped gratefully. \"I don't think that. Clive has some very strong views. We all know that. He's always spoken, er, openly and, um, robustly. Clive has spoken a lot of truths; I'll accept that. The challenge for the RFU is to try and implement as much of Clive's vision as possible. But these things take time. They will probably only be achieved after I have left.\" </p> <p>The laughter echoed cruelly. Woodward smiled a little more. He was ready to talk about anything. \"I've been fascinated watching the Olympics. When you're watching the rowers and sprinters and Kelly Holmes they win by inches. You cannot compromise on elite performance. And we didn't win the World Cup by a mile. We won it by an inch. We won in the 20th minute of extra-time and we did it by preparing properly. If this country is serious about its rugby team, then you cannot compromise. I might be in a minority of one but that doesn't mean I'm wrong.\" </p> <p>But might it mean that he was swapping rugby for football? Was he on his way to Southampton and perhaps eventually the England football team? </p> <p>\"I've applied to do a Grade 2 coaching award with the FA,\" Woodward said dryly. \"I did not apply for the England coaching job. I'm not stupid. Football is like any other sport. You only get put into positions if you've got the full respect of the players you're going to coach. And in football terms I'm a million miles off that. I've got to start right at the bottom, which I intend to do. I'll do everything properly and I'll not be taking a paid position in football until after the Lions tour.\" </p> <p>Woodward was obviously too canny to reveal the full extent of his sweeping ambition. And yet, for all the effectiveness of his display, a significant doubt must remain about even his ability to make such an intriguing switch, from international rugby to professional football. Gaining the trust and belief of insular and cynical young footballers, who inhabit such a contrasting world from the men Woodward usually coaches, will be a far more exacting task than stripping bare the incompetence of the RFU. After his World Cup rugby triumph, a glorious failure in football still seems more likely. </p> <p>That did not deter a cheery young woman from Meridian TV, who introduced herself \"on behalf of Saints fans\". </p> <p>\"Can you explain the offside rule?\" she asked. \"I've not done my Grade 2 coaching yet . . .\" </p> <p>\"But would you like to end up at Southampton?\" the voice of the Saints persisted. </p> <p>\"I may end up coaching Maidenhead Under-9s,\" Woodward quipped as Baron snorted. \"I could end up anywhere. I've been to American Football teams many times but I've never had these kind of headlines. I'm not intending to be an NFL coach - at the moment.\" </p> <p>And then, after an hour in which he had utterly shredded the RFU, he was gone. \"I'm going to miss you, you know,\" Woodward said to more laughter, as he set off on his next adventure. </p> <p>He looked as if he knew exactly where he was heading - and it was not towards either the Denver Broncos or Maidenhead Under-9s. Woodward is set for the Lions tour of New Zealand next summer and then the jungle of football. </p> <p>He may yet fail with both wild dreams - but it is going to be some adventure. And in the end, whatever happens to Woodward's grand plans, the traumatised world of English rugby will have become just a little less interesting. </p> <p><strong>The final straw</strong></p> <p>1. Sixty players, announced at the start of the season, will have individually agreed training, playing and rest programmes, with the England coaches and Premiership directors of rugby liaising. </p> <p>2. There will be 16 player-release dates for the next three seasons in addition to the week spent training before every international.</p> <p>3. No EPS player will play more than 32 matches for club and country in any one year starting from August 1, though dispensation may be granted by the RFU's performance director.</p> <p>4. Each EPS player will have an off-season of 11 weeks which will take effect from the date of his last game.</p> <p>5. Squads named 10 days before an international with no more than 30 players named. Up to 37 players will be available for summer tours.</p> <p>6. Clubs will receive \u00a330,000 each year for every player they provide to the EPS and \u00a310,000 for each identified national academy player on a full-time contract.</p>",
  "<p> Andy Farrell and Danny McGuire, two front runners for this season's Man of Steel title, cancelled each other out as these two potential grand finalists fought out a compelling draw last night. </p> <p>McGuire scored two more spectacular second-half tries as the Rhinos came from 8-0 behind to lead 12-10, taking his tally for the season, already a Super League record, to 35. </p> <p>But a high tackle by the Leeds prop Wayne McDonald on Adrian Lam then gifted Farrell a fourth goal to bring the scores level, and despite a frantic finish in which each team went close to a clinching score - notably when McGuire was denied his hat-trick by Kris Radlinski's superb cover tackle - they had to settle for a point each. </p> <p>That was a much better result for Leeds than for Wigan. The Rhinos have already secured top spot in the final table and are now 10 points clear of second-placed Hull. </p> <p>Wigan, though, have now won only one of their last six matches, a run which included a home draw against Hull. St Helens could be the big winners this weekend because they will go above their fierce local rivals into fourth if they win at Warrington tomorrow. </p> <p>\"We're a little bit disappointed but at the same time happy with the performance,\" said the home coach Denis Betts. \"It was a draw but I think we'll get a lot more out of it ourselves.\" </p> <p>Brian Carney had set the tone with a spectacular solo try in the third minute. There is no more thrilling sight in the game than the Irishman in full flight, but this was only his second try of a wretchedly injury-plagued season. </p> <p>Wigan remained dominant to half-time but scored only via the boot of Farrell, who after converting from the touchline added a much simpler penalty. That was a tribute to the Leeds defence, an often overlooked reason for their position now. </p> <p>But the game changed after half-time, with five consecutive penalties handing Leeds control. McGuire capitalised, supporting a break by the excellent hooker Matt Diskin to dart between the posts. </p> <p>Kevin Sinfield's conversion cut Wigan's lead to 8-6 before Farrell made it 10-6 when the unpredictable referee Karl Kirkpatrick decided it was Wigan's turn for a penalty. </p> <p>Four minutes later, though, McGuire was dancing over again to put the Rhinos ahead for the first time. That lead did not last, but Leeds have still lost only twice in the league in an ultra-consistent season. </p> <p> <strong> Wigan Warriors: </strong> Radlinski; Carney, Wild, Aspinwall, Dallas; Brown, Lam; Farrell, M Smith, C Smith, Hock, Tickle, O'Loughlin. <strong> Subs: </strong> O'Connor, Cassidy, Robinson, Connolly. </p> <p><strong> Leeds Rhinos:</strong> Mathers; Calderwood, Walker, Senior, Bai; McGuire, Burrow; McDonald, Diskin, Ward, McKenna, Lauiti'iti, Sinfield. <strong> Subs: </strong> Bailey, Adamson, Poching, Jones-Buchanan. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> K Kirkpatrick (Warrington).</p>",
  "<p>When Sergio Garcia was a little lad, he was actually a very little lad - not very tall and extremely slight of build. But throughout his early teens he was so outrageously talented in every other area of the game of golf, that he kept getting picked for national teams that played against much older, bigger and longer-off-the-tee lads. </p> <p>So Sergio had to find a way to keep up with them and he developed what he now calls a \"lag\" at the top of the backswing but which, in reality, was a vicious whiplash that sent the ball the required distance and enabled him to remain in contention. </p> <p>The problem was that he did not always know where the ball was going and when in the fullness of time he turned professional, it was obvious he would have to do something about it. The process of acquiring a different plane of swing with a much abbreviated \"lag\" at the top, began at the Accenture Match Play in February last year and has begun to pay enormous dividends for the Spaniard this year. </p> <p>Yesterday, for instance, he added a six-under 65 to his opening 66 in the Omega European Masters, thereby establishing himself as the leader at the halfway stage, one ahead of Miguel Angel Jimenez and three ahead of 20-year-old Charl Schwartzel and Luke Donald. </p> <p>Garcia, of course, plays most of his golf on the US Tour, on which he has won twice already this year and thanks to the changed qualification system, made his way into the Ryder Cup team off the world rankings. </p> <p>He puts the success down to sheer hard work and preparation. \"The first three months were the hardest,\" he confessed frankly yesterday. \"I was hitting balls everyday, which I don't normally do, with my Dad filming me, making sure I was doing it right. I wanted to make sure the club was in a good spot at the top. I wanted to get the feel of that and then try to repeat and repeat that feel. It was a lot of work but also fun. I enjoyed trying to get things going the right way.\" </p> <p>They are mostly going the right way this week. Garcia hit a drive of 370 yards - \"just a nice little fade\" - down the 14th and when they go wrong, he has to rely on that innate natural talent of his. At the short 3rd, for instance, he borrowed from the armoury of impossible shots once possessed by his countryman, Severiano Ballesteros. </p> <p>\"I was trying to hit a cut seven-iron into the middle of the green, when a little demon got into my right shoulder and said make sure you don't over-cut it and so I pulled it instead.\" </p> <p>The ball clattered into a cypress pine, finishing underneath it. Garcia was left peering mournfully through the tree's branches in order to catch a glimpse of his wayward ball. \"I had about three-feet of backswing,\" said Garcia, \"and I punched it into a bank and let it run down to three feet.\" </p> <p>\"That,\" added the Spaniard, with considerable understatement, \"was a good three there\". Garcia, whose natural shot before the changes was a draw, is now more comfortable with a fade. \"I can hit my draw if I want to but when I have a tight shot, I feel I can control a fade better.\" </p> <p>Such self-awareness appears to echo Dallas-born Lee Trevino, five times a major champion, who always used to quip that you can talk to a fade but a hook will never listen. Garcia amended the Trevino edict a little. </p> <p>\"You can talk to a fade and you can talk to a draw, but you can't talk to a hook and you can't talk to a slice, either.\"</p>",
  "<p> Lancashire's astonishing fall from grace this summer has prompted some disgruntled members to question the team's spirit and commitment, while others have already started planning their trips to Durham, Derby and Leicester next year. But yesterday afternoon the lower middle order, led by Chris Schofield, showed that they would not accept relegation without a fight. </p> <p>A repeat of the spineless innings defeat by Surrey they suffered at Whitgift School last month looked a real possibility when Mal Loye was bowled for 54, shortly after Stuart Law and Carl Hooper had perished in the space of three balls from Nayan Doshi, leaving them five wickets down with another 108 needed to avoid the follow-on. </p> <p>But Schofield and Glen Chapple lifted Lancastrian spirits in an entertaining sixth-wicket stand of 114, the leg-spinner's performance all the more commendable as he was clearly suffering after being hit on the foot by a yorker from Azhar Mahmood before he had reached double figures. </p> <p>However, a couple of wickets for Martin Bicknell and another two from Doshi's promising left-arm spin ensured that Surrey retained their grip on the match and left Lancashire as far away as ever from the win they desperately need in their battle against relegation. </p> <p>Bicknell, who had trapped Mark Chilton lbw before lunch, returned after tea to dismiss Chapple and Dominic Cork with consecutive crackers, a leg-cutter to have Chapple caught behind for 67 followed by a nip-backer to bowl Cork through the gate for a golden duck. </p> <p>Doshi, the 24-year-old son of the former India spinner Dilip, whom Surrey picked up playing league cricket for Ealing in June, then lured Schofield into an ill-advised charge down the pitch. Jon Batty completed his second straightforward stumping, after Hooper had gone in similar fashion for a second-ball duck, and then took the third of his four catches after Doshi found Warren Hegg's outside edge. </p> <p>Doshi did not turn the ball as much as Gary Keedy had on the first day but varied his flight cleverly to earn career best figures of five for 125. Iain Sutcliffe was well caught at short-leg by Richard Clinton off his second ball but Peter Walker, who had been sent to inspect the pitch, was already satisfied that it was nothing more sinister than an old-fashioned slow, low turner.</p>",
  "<p>England's captain Michael Vaughan recently suggested that Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff is the best cricketer in the world. Flintoff has not heard that one but he is having none of it. \"Er, no,\" he says instantly. He bursts out laughing. \"No.\" He gives a stuff-and-nonsense look and says the best players are Sachin Tendulkar the best batsman, Muttiah Muralitharan the best bowler. </p> <p>It has been an amazing cricketing summer for England, with seven straight Test victories, and an equally amazing Freddie summer. He has scored a half-century or more in every Test, taken wickets regularly despite his ankle injury and is up for all three of cricket's new Oscars on Monday: best player, best Test player, best one-dayer. After tomorrow's final warm-up game against India comes the Champions Trophy, a mini World Cup where Flintoff will be one of the star attractions. It is a far cry from the giant pudding who nearly destroyed his Test career by eating and drinking himself into a national joke. </p> <p>Despite his familiarity nothing quite prepares one for Flintoff. One knows he is 6ft 4in, 17 stone and all that but, when he walks in, I am still shocked. Blond and bearded, he is so bloody huge that I wonder where he has left his Viking helmet. His feet look like tiny adjuncts; he takes only a size 12. </p> <p>We meet in Cheshire at the office of his agent, the former England batsman Neil Fairbrother. Before the big man arrives, Fairbrother talks about him with pride and affection. The stories he tells are of Fred the man not Fred the cricketer. He would not dare tell them in front of him for fear of embarrassing him. </p> <p>I congratulate Flintoff on his season. \"Cheers, thanks. It's been all right, yeah,\" he says. \"Can't complain, been good fun.\" He apologises for being knackered; he had a night out with his manager Chubby Chandler on Wednesday and spent Thursday fly-fishing. \"I caught three trout.\" Well done, I say. \"It was a stocked lake,\" he says, \"so you can't really miss.\" Although he is larger than life, there is a sweetness, a shyness to Flintoff. Players say he livens up the England dressing room but it is probably more by his presence than by anything he says or does. </p> <p>Flintoff grew up in Blackpool and captained the Lancashire Under-11s. He came from a cricketing family. His father, now in his mid-50s, still turns out for a league team when called upon and his older brother holds the record for highest score in the Preston local league. Freddie was playing for the Lancashire second team by the time he was 15 and decided there was not much point in staying on for A levels because he already knew what he wanted to do with life. </p> <p>What was he like at school? \"I was all right, yeah, believe it or not. Nobody believes me.\" How many GCSEs did he get? \"Nine.\" Nine, I say, surprised. After all, Flintoff is often portrayed as a noble savage. He bursts out laughing: \"Ehehehehehehehahahaha! That's the reaction I normally get.\" His deep bass rises to a squeak. He played chess, too, for Lancashire when he was 11, and his brother played for England. Perhaps we should out you as a clever sod? \"No, might be bad for the image, that,\" he says. </p> <p>When he arrived at Lancashire as a 16-year-old professional he was as tall as he is today and thin as a rake, he says. So what happened? \"I ballooned.\" How? \"I always ate a lot when I was skinny and I think it caught up on me. And I drank a bit as well,\" he says bashfully. His drinking is legendary. </p> <p>I show him an article from the Sydney Morning Herald. Flintoff is regarded by the Australians as an honorary Aussie who can play and drink as hard as they can. His Lancashire colleague Stuart Law, who is Australian, is quoted as saying: \"He'd give David Boon's 52 cans a real nudge on the London to Melbourne trip. I reckon he'd do it quite easily. I've had a few nights out with him and, when you come in the next morning and the boys ask what did you do last night, it's 'well, I got freddied'.\" </p> <p>As I read it to him, he mutters, \"Cheers Stu.\" So does he think he could break the 52-tin record? \"I don't know about that. That's a lot of ale that is.\" He is not ruling it out, though. </p> <p>Flintoff looks fit and healthy today, so different from a few years ago. Back then, he says he was simply doing what so many young men do - pub, curry, late nights. What time would a typical night out start? \"A night out? Probably start in the afternoon about two, and just go through.\" Even if he did not go out, he would probably order himself a curry for tea. \"When you're living on your own or with a mate it's easier to get something brought round rather than going to Sainsbury's and going through the Too-Good-To-Be-True range.\" </p> <p>Flintoff made his Test debut at 20 in 1998. He fluffed it. In three innings against South Africa he scored 17 runs and he took one wicket for 117 runs. Things did not get much better. I tell him how disappointed I was in him - such talent, but one just knew he would be out after a couple of decent blows. \"I felt like that as well,\" he says. He was dropped from the England squad in 2000. \"I was just rubbish. I was lucky to be playing for Lancashire, never mind England.\" </p> <p>So how did he manage to turn it all round? Well, he says, it started with a rollocking from Bobby Simpson, the former Australia captain, then Lancashire's coach. \"I just sat there and listened. He talked about the way I was playing and at the end of the season I got hauled in by Neil and Chubby [Fairbrother and Chandler] and they gave me a few home truths about what I was doing and where I could get to and how I could get to it.\" </p> <p>What did they say he was doing wrong? \"I was just wasting, just drifting along probably for two to three years.\" Had he not been aware of that or had he been too busy enjoying himself? \"To be honest with you . . .\" and he pauses, to think it through, \". . . I must have done, I must have done, I'm not stupid, I must have done, but I probably just needed it to come from somebody else, and people I'm close to.\" </p> <p>So he sat down with Fairbrother and Chandler and they devised a game plan, first to regain form for Lancashire and then to get back into the England side. Did they work on his fitness or his attitude? \"A bit of everything.\" He cut down on the food and drink, took his nets seriously, worked on his technique and his consistency and calmed down in every sense. </p> <p>He went back to basics. \"I phoned Duncan Fletcher up and asked him if I could go on the Academy to Australia. There was a lot of training at the academy.\" Things improved gradually and in 2001 he got a call to go to India during the Test series. \"It was a bit of a lifeline, to be honest. I bowled well. I think I scored 25 runs, had an absolute stinker with the bat, but I was contributing with the ball, so it was some consolation.\" </p> <p>How tough were the tough times? \"I think the hard times were easier to come through because they were self-inflicted. It was just a case of getting meself right.\" </p> <p>Does he think he has got himself right now? \"Touch wood,\" he says and bangs the table with his knuckles. \"Yeah, I think so. I'm 26, I think I've matured as a person and as a cricketer. I think my missus has helped. She keeps me in check but that's good, to be honest.\" </p> <p>He lives with his fianc\u00e9e Rachel in Cheshire. They are expecting their first child and are planning to marry next year. In so many ways, he says, he feels as if he has been given a second chance. \"In everything, yeah - in personal life, and in cricket. Pretty much what happened before, I just drawn a line under it because I feel I'm a different person, a different player.\" </p> <p>But he can draw a line under part one of his Test career only to an extent. Despite his phenomenal 18 months, averaging well over 50 with the bat and less than 26 per wicket, his averages with bat and ball have still risen only from appalling to mediocre. He laughs and says averages have never been his priority. </p> <p>\"Rather than averages I like to look at the end of the season at how many games you've influenced or how many you've helped to win. Averages can be misleading. You score runs in the second innings of a dead game or you score runs when you get beat.\" He has a point and it is great to see a selfless cricketer but even so ... \"Well, it is getting up there,\" he protests. \"If I play till I'm 60 I might average 45.\" </p> <p>He says one of the main reasons for England's success has been the leadership of Michael Vaughan. \"There's a lot of enjoyment in that side now, it's just like 11 blokes having a game of cricket.\" Is that a change? \"Yes,obviously winning helps the pleasure angle. But, when Vaughany came in, that helped me as well. He had a word and told me to do what I do, play the way I play and encouraged me to express myself. Nasser was a good captain. He turned it round a little bit and then Vaughany inherited more or less Nasser's side. Obviously they are different players. Nasser is animated and obviously very passionate while Vaughany just sits back a bit more and lets everybody get on with it. He has a laugh with the lads. He's a good fella.\" </p> <p>Would Flintoff like to captain England? His eyes light up. \"Yeah. I captained Lancashire Under-11 and England Under-19s . . . and I did two Twenty20 games this summer and I didn't have a clue!\" Would he be a good skipper? \"I don't know, to be honest. I'd like to think so.\" He says the important thing is to be true to yourself. \"That's what Vaughany's done so well, he's still himself. I'd love to have a go but at the moment I've got enough on my plate and we're all enjoying playing under Michael.\" Anyway, he says, he has more immediate ambitions. \"I want to be a good father. Aye, I want to be a good one of those. And in cricket, I want to win the Ashes and win the World Cup.\" </p> <p>Over the past year Flintoff has become a popular hero. I ask him how aware he is of it. He ums and ahs and says yes, he knows he is more popular than he was, and it is great, but he is still the same old Freddie with the same old mates, enjoying a Guinness and black (\"I get a bit of stick for the blackcurrant\") - just one of the lads. He is not going to do anything daft like start to think he is the world's best cricketer or a celebrity or go teetotal. Things are as they always were. His mother, his missus and his grandparents still call him Andrew and that is the way he likes it. \"I think it would be strange if my mum or my missus started calling me Fred.\" </p> <p>Before Flintoff arrived, Fairbrother said he had just received a call from a man whose wife has multiple sclerosis and he wanted to get in touch with Flintoff. Fairbrother asked him why and the man told him because at The Oval at the beginning of the final day a few of the players, Freddie included, went to talk to them, then eight hours later, after Flintoff had won the man-of-the-series award, he ran over to them. \"The guy said Fred lent down to his wife Karen and said 'Karen, I'd like you to have my man-of-the-series champagne', and the bloke was in tears at the end of the phone telling me.\" </p> <p>I mention the story to Flintoff and he shrugs it off. \"I was walking round the ground and I had a bottle of champagne in my hand and it was either going to get aimlessly sprayed at someone ... and I just saw 'em, so I thought you'll probably put it to better use than pouring it on Steve Harmison's head.\"</p>",
  "Police yesterday launched a review of security after an intruder armed with a machete stormed the headquarters of MI5 and the Northern Ireland Office, wounding two security guards. <p>The man, in his 40s, is thought to have gone berserk after entering Thames House in central London, where both services are based. </p> <p>Police said the man went first into the Northern Ireland Office, where he struggled with security guards. He is then thought to have run outside and round the corner to the entrance to the lobby of MI5. </p> <p>Officers from an armed response unit shot the intruder twice with a stun gun before he slumped to the ground in the street. </p> <p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \"At 1.15pm we were called to Thames House, Millbank, to reports of an intruder armed with a knife. </p> <p>\"Police attended and discovered a man in his 40s outside the building armed with a machete and a large knife. He was challenged by officers and refused to cooperate. </p> <p>\"A Taser [stun gun] was discharged by police and the man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and assault and taken by an ambulance to hospital.\" </p> <p>The man was tackled by officers from SO16, the Metropolitan police's diplomatic protection unit. </p> <p>The spokesman added: \"At this early stage we believe the man entered the building by the Northern Ireland Office entrance on the corner of Millbank and Horseferry Road. </p> <p>\"During confrontations, one of the security guards suffered cuts to the hand and another guard suffered cuts to the arm. They were treated by paramedics at the scene and then taken to hospital where they remain in a stable condition. </p> <p>\"Detectives from the specialist crime directorate are investigating the incident.\" </p> <p>The attack immediately raised concerns about security arrangements at Thames House, which is on Millbank, close to the Houses of Parliament. </p> <p>The MI5 entrance opens straight on to the street next to the river Thames but there are no protective concrete blocks outside and, unlike the headquarters of the secret intelligence service, MI6, at Vauxhall Bridge, there is no perimeter wall. </p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"We can confirm that the Metropolitan police have been invited to undertake a joint review of security at Thames House.\" </p> <p>MI5 has recently been reviewing the security arrangements of the nearby House of Commons after protesters from Fathers for Justice launched a flour-bomb attack on Tony Blair during prime minister's questions in May. </p> <p>The attackers, demanding that fathers have more access to their children after a marriage break-up, threw purple powder from an area of the public gallery reserved for guests of MPs and members of the House of Lords. </p> <p>Taser guns, which produce a high electrical voltage to stun a target, have been in use in London since last year. </p> <p>Human rights groups have condemned Taser guns, and British companies are banned from exporting them, but the police have promoted them as safer than plastic bullets, which can be lethal. </p> <p>MI5 is responsible for UK domestic security. It moved to Thames House in 1994 to provide more modern office space to cope with updated computer technology.</p>",
  "Bill Clinton, the former US president, checked himself into a New York City hospital yesterday for heart bypass surgery after suffering chest pains and a shortness of breath. <p>\"He will be having surgery early in the week,\" his wife, Senator Hillary Clinton said last night after visiting her husband in hospital.</p> <p>Mr Clinton, 58, went to his doctor on Thursday and was told to have an angiogram, which was administered yesterday and revealed a \"significant blockage\", said a statement from his office, although the spokesman did not think that Mr Clinton had had a heart attack.</p> <p>The television news networks ABC and CBS reported that Mr Clinton was told he needed a quadruple heart bypass.</p> <p>His office said the former president \"went to Northern Westchester hospital yesterday afternoon after experiencing mild chest pain and shortness of breath.

She apologised for leaving right away. \"He's in excellent hands,\" she said.</p> <p>Mr Clinton, the 42nd US president, promised at the Democratic national convention in July to be a \"foot soldier\" in John Kerry's race against the Republican president, George Bush. The former president received a rousing welcome from delegates after being introduced by his wife.</p> <p>\"He's going to be fine,\" Mr Kerry told a campaign rally in Newark, Ohio, yesterday.</p> <p>\"But every single one of us wants to extend to him our best wishes, our prayers and our thoughts, and I want you all to let a cheer out and a clap that he can hear all the way to New York,\" the Democratic contender added to cheers.</p> <p>In early 2001, shortly after Mr Clinton's presidency ended, he had a cancerous growth removed from his back which turned out to be basal cell carcinoma, the most treatable form of skin cancer.</p> <p>In 1996, he had had a pre-cancerous lesion removed from his nose, and a year before that had a benign cyst taken off his chest.</p> <p>Other than that, Mr Clinton has had the normal health problems that often accompany ageing - periods of slightly elevated cholesterol and hearing loss - and an appetite for junk food.

  "All that was left were the ashes. On the floor of the gym at Middle School No 1 yesterday lay the mangled, black detritus from Russia's worst hostage crisis. Corrugated iron roofing, loft insulation material, soggy wood and an endless black, unidentifiable mulch, still smoking. <p>It was a skeletal scene. Rescuers tore out the shredded window frames, ducking gunfire and grenade blasts, and firefighters drenched the beams that stood where a roof once was. A curtain fluttered in the wind. Children's drawings from their art classes could still be seen taped across windows. But there was no one left to walk out of the ruins. </p> <p>It is hard to believe that hundreds of women and children had been held in the gym. </p> <p>An intricate series of wires, in which mines were strung between the gym's two basketball hoops and along its outer walls, had malfunctioned. When the militants fulfilled their unspeakable threat to blow themselves and their schoolchild hostages up if Russian troops stormed the school, only two mines went off. </p> <p>Yet the damage was still immense in its scale and inhumanity, killing at least 150 hostages. Interfax news agency later put the toll at 200, quoting regional health ministry sources. </p> <p>The intense firefight erupted at 1.05pm. Two huge blasts sounded out across the town of Beslan, sending families, officials and ranks of media into panic. It remains unclear what final spark unleashed the force of two sides practised at trying to extinguish each other. </p> <p>One local official confirmed that emergency workers had been admitted into the schoolyard to collect the bodies of 20 men executed by the hostage-takers in the first few hours of the crisis. They had been dumped out of the windows of the second floor of the main school building. </p> <p>The official said: \"When the rescuers came to the bodies, a mine laid by the militants went off. And then the federal troops began the siege.\" </p> <p>Other reports suggested that the battle flared after one of the hostage-takers, a woman with explosives strapped around her waist, unintentionally detonated the bombs, blasting a hole through the gym wall. </p> <p>Ilfa Gagiyeva, 33, a local investigator trapped inside with her daughter Diana, 7, witnessed what happened inside the gym when the militants finally made good their threat to blow up themselves and the building if the Russian military stormed it. </p> <p>\"There had been shootouts all day between the terrorists and the troops,\" she said. </p> <p>\"We were all undressed. It was like a sauna in there. No water or food and we were all burning up with fear. </p> <p>\"They had put mines all around the room, running two wires between the gym's basketball hoops and hanging mines off them. </p> <p>\"But when they tried to detonate them, only two of the mines worked. Both blasts missed me, although one was very close. </p> <p>\"One militant, Hassan, who was in the toilet for the explosion, tried to help us get fresh air into the gym. I ran to grab my child and we hid in the small hall near the gym. There we stood for 20 minutes, dealing with the wounded and hiding, until the spetznaz found us and led us out.\" </p> <p>All around the school, intense fighting had broken out. Next to the local administration building, 300 metres away from the school, the doors of the nearby cafe, whose back door connected to the school, burst open at about 1.10pm. </p> <p>Women and policemen carried out grimy, naked and bloodied children, paralysed by fear. \"Help us carry them,\" screamed one man. Most of the 20 or more victims appeared alive and petrified as a series of impromptu cars came to drive them away. </p> <p>The growing clatter of gunfire and grenade blasts sharpened the fears of local police. It was unclear who was shooting at who, or why, yet it was getting fiercer and louder. </p> <p>One local ministry of interior officer said at 1.20pm: \"We've not killed any of the militants, and I don't know about our troops, but there was an explosion, and many hostages died.\" </p> <p>Rescuers panicked to extract the children - often their own children - from the continuing gun battle. </p> <p>From one side of the school, they smashed a hole through a garage wall, to provide a wide corridor to the fire trucks, Ladas, vans and ambulances that waited to take the dead away. Heaving with fear, sweat and anger, they braved stray bullets and shrapnel to push through the walls with axes and a telegraph pole so they could reach the school courtyard. </p> <p>Then the bodies came out through the damp, dark garage. </p> <p>A limp woman, her crimson top covered in soot and her skirt ripped off. Two injured soldiers. Two scared children, naked in the arms of frantic policemen, having discarded their clothes in the intense heat and panic of two days as hostages to Russia's brutal Chechen conflict. </p> <p>In the street, ambulance drivers struggled to understand directions barked at them. </p> <p>\"Come here now,\" one man shouted, yet as the gunfire picked up again another begged the ambulance to head back down the street. </p> <p>Above the garages were the blown-out and blackened windows of a block of flats where the troops had holed up, their posts destroyed by militant grenade launchers. </p> <p>Down in the street, a Russian special forces, or spetznaz, commander managed to crack a joke for his men, their smiles a brief change from the sweaty and red-faced grimaces from beneath their protective helmets. </p> <p>The blasts continued and files of spetznaz began to run towards the railway line that runs past both the local government building and the school. Mi-8 and Mi-24 attack helicopters circled above the school and at 1.45pm the gunfire fell silent. </p> <p>As anxious government workers cowered around the building, a local security service officer said: \"Wait, there will be more to come.\" </p> <p>The police beckoned the hordes of angry local men - infuriated at their children being targeted - to step back from the building. </p> <p>Many refused, one shouting: \"Give me a gun, I'll get them.\" </p> <p>At the front of the school, the dead came more quickly. </p> <p>A girl with shrapnel embedded in her face. A man with severe head injuries. Two young girls, their bodies covered in soot, the sight causing men to hold their heads in their hands. </p> <p>And then a young militant, his slight body battered heavily by local men and dragged, his underwear pulled down, across the concrete and dumped in the back of a medical truck. </p> <p>Bystanders peered in, grinned at his fate, and cursed his purported Chechen nationality. </p> <p>Fatima Bazoyeva, a nurse, said she had heard of 500 wounded in the hospitals and that a boy she had treated said he'd seen 20 dead inside. </p> <p>A doctor said he did not know the number of dead, simply that there were \"many\". Another said he had heard 96 children were freed alive. Rescue workers ducked persistent, random fire from the back of the school. </p> <p>By 2pm, as the gunfire began again, spetznaz began to file down the railway track towards the school. </p> <p>A Kremlin aide appeared to shout into his phone: \"They have taken some children.\" Down the track, a spetznaz soldier said of the start of the siege: \"Tell everyone everything is OK, and everything is fine. Look at me, I went there [pointing to the siege] and I came back.\" </p> <p>Across the rail tracks gunfire sounded, a local policeman saying some militants had headed across the line and sought to escape the way they came. The report could not be confirmed, but helicopters swarmed above as gunfire was exchanged in that part of the town for over an hour. Many young local men came to the scene armed with hunting rifles, and often wearing police smocks and webbing they had bought privately. They kept offering help to the federal forces, blurring the line between troops, police and local vigilantes. </p> <p>A local policeman's radio directed him to organise a secure perimeter in case the militants managed to get out. </p> <p>Back near the Palace of Culture, where relatives had waited anxiously, the bodies began to pile up. </p> <p>A long glade that ran from near the palace to the school filled with emergency workers and stretchers, providing an endless stream of limp bodies for ambulance workers. </p> <p>Two of the dead were laid on the grass verge near the pavement, their dignity maintained by a white sheet as media and local men milled around rescuers. Then the noise of gunfire and hysteria was pierced by a terrible groan. One of the women beneath the sheets was still alive. A passerby knelt down and held her head in her hands. </p> <p>Numbers of dead, militants, hostages and wounded troops eluded most officials and combatants. </p> <p>One military radio operator, his arm bandaged, said: \"How could I know how many of anything there are in that mess? </p> <p>\"There are many dead, that's all.\" </p> <p>The stretchers bore the news of another Russian siege ending in bloodshed. </p> <p>A middle-aged woman, lifeless. A young girl probably aged seven, roof materials scattered across her limp, grimy body. </p> <p>The stream had been constant all afternoon, witnesses said, their bodies ferried off to the local hospital or the larger facility in Vladikavkaz, about 20 minutes' drive away. </p> <p>The exchange of fire continued, resilient militants digging into the back end of the school, and refusing to budge after endless grenade launches. </p> <p>Five hours of intense violence had brought Russia's biggest hostage crisis to the bloodiest of ends.</p>",
  "<p>Two pensioners who were sacked by their employer failed yesterday to overturn a court ruling that denied them the right to claim unfair dismissal and redundancy pay. </p> <p>A court of appeal judgment said the men had failed to prove that employment rights extended beyond the state retirement age. </p> <p>The ruling overturns an employment tribunal decision in favour of the pensioners. Under current laws, over-65s are not eligible for redundancy payments or protected from unfair dismissal. </p> <p>Lawyers acting for John Rutherford and Samuel Bentley said they would need time to study the judgment but would consider asking the court leave to appeal to the House of Lords. </p> <p>The dispute, which has been going on for more than five years, began when Mr Rutherford, from Essex, and Mr Bentley, from Islington, north London, were dismissed from their jobs in the clothing industry. Both were in their 70s. </p> <p>They argued UK laws discriminated against men, who were affected more by lack of employment protection than women. The laws amounted to sex discrimination, they said, and were in breach of EU equal pay legislation which should apply in their case. </p> <p>The employment tribunal supported the case but the Department of Trade and Industry appealed, and a review last year threw out the argument. Mr Rutherford and Mr Bentley went to the court of appeal in March and learned of its judgment yesterday. </p> <p>Pensioner groups said they were dismayed the government did not see the case as a chance to end what they believe is ageism in the workplace. </p> <p>Gordon Lishman, director-general of Age Concern England, said: \"This judgment is a kick in the teeth for older people in work. The outcome of this appeal means that age discrimination remains acceptable in the workplace, denying employment rights to all those working beyond 65. </p> <p>\"The future of older people's rights and choices at work now hangs in the balance. But the government has a chance to rectify its actions. If it is bold it will deliver equality for people of all ages by scrapping mandatory retirement ages and offering full employment protection to all workers.\" </p> <p>Other groups, including the Employers Forum on Age, have argued that trying to bring about reform using a sex discrimination claim is flawed, and older workers should wait until EU laws abolishing an upper age limit on unfair dismissal come into effect in 2006.</p>",
  "<p>Employers with fewer than 15 staff were warned this week to make sure they complied with the new disability discrimination act, which comes into force next month. </p> <p>The new regulations end the exemption of employers with fewer than 15 staff from the law which protects disabled people from discrimination in the workplace. In addition, police officers, fire-fighters and prison officers will be brought within the scope of the act. </p> <p>This will mean that no employer can discriminate against disabled job applicants or employees on the basis of their disability. Around 1m employers and 7m jobs will be affected. </p> <p>The act will now cover an estimated 9.8m adults. It is expected proposals to extend its protection to more people with HIV, cancer and multiple sclerosis will also be included in the act. And workers suffering from stress will be given greater protection under the new rules which will recognise some mental health conditions as a disability. </p> <p>The legislation will also mean employers will not be able to sack staff who have been diagnosed with serious illnesses such as cancer or multiple sclerosis. </p> <p>Andrew Smith, the work and pensions secretary, says employers should be required to make adjustments for people with mental health conditions. These will include a right to flexibility in working hours to allow them to attend counselling, and exemption from speaking to large gatherings of people if they are not comfortable in those situations. </p> <p>He told a conference organised by the charity Scope earlier this summer: \"In years to come, the treatment of disabled people typical of the last century - and still too often the case today - will be seen as an affront to their humanity. It is the last great cause of emancipation of our time.\" </p> <p>Meriel Schindler, head of employment law at solicitors Withers, says discrimination cases at employment tribunals have often debated whether the employer has fewer than 15 employes. She says one case involving a Citizens Advice shop centred on whether volunteers should be included as workers. </p> <p>\"The amendments to the act are going to have a significant impact on smaller employers and especially those that have failed to notice the change in rules,\" she says. </p> <p>The Disability Rights Commission said it had dedicated most of its campaigning efforts on the changes forcing retailers to make provision for customers with disabilities. </p> <p>Minister for Disabled People Maria Eagle, who is leading the campaign to raise awareness of the disability discrimination act among businesses, says: \"Opening up to disabled customers and staff is not all about expensive ramps and lifts. In fact it could be a lot easier than businesses think. Many quick and cheap DIY solutions could make all the difference to disabled people. </p> <p>\"Improving lighting and signage and painting walls and doors in contrasting colours aren't difficult things to do but can be a great help to visually impaired people. Lowering shelves and widening aisles for wheelchair users are also improvements that can be done cheaply and quickly. </p> <p>\"There are more than 10m disabled people in Britain, with spending power worth some \u00a350bn. It makes business sense to ensure they are able to spend their money and business sense for employers to tap into that pool of talent.\" </p> <p>The government runs a scheme which provides support for disabled people and their employers.

  "<p>As Tesco's directors award themselves rises taking their average pay package to \u00a33.2m, their use of the slogan, \"Every little helps\" to encourage us to shop in their supermarkets may seem a little patronising. </p> <p>To give them their due though, they are practising what they preach by participating in a scheme set up by most of Britain's large retailers to deprive the tax man of a few pennies from transactions in their stores. </p> <p>Shoppers may have wondered about the purpose of notices that in recent years have appeared at check outs and on till receipts saying something like, \"Tesco Merchant Services Ltd processes all card transactions for a 2.5% handling charge which is included in the cost of your shopping.\" </p> <p>The answer is that some bright spark at department store, Debenhams' accountants, thought that their client might be able to avoid paying VAT on the handling charge. The 2.5% is an arbitrary figure and does not necessarily reflect what is paid to the bank for processing the transaction. Large retailers are generally able to negotiate lower commissions. </p> <p>The practical consequence is that stores save 37p on every \u00a3100 of a VAT-able transaction. For a store like Tesco which turns over around \u00a365m per day, that is an enormous sum, even allowing for the fact that VAT is not payable on most foods and that the deduction does not yet apply to cash and cheque transactions. In its case, \"every little\" will amount to almost \u00a3100m a year. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, the Customs &amp; Excise, which collects VAT, took a dim view of such schemes, and attempted to levy the tax on the 2.5%, relying partly on a European Court decision that had prevented Bally shoes from using such a scheme in Belgium. </p> <p>The C&amp;E brought a test case against Debenhams. Although it only related to a short period, more than \u00a3600,000 was directly at stake. </p> <p>Initially the VAT tribunal decided that the scheme did not work. That decision has been overturned by Mr Justice Lindsay in the High Court, but, as the judge himself acknowledged, that is unlikely to be the last word on the matter. The issue is tied up with the complexities of European law that underlies UK VAT. </p> <p>The Customs &amp; Excise may have fallen into error in accepting that Debenhams, and other stores, and the \"merchant services\" company to which the 2.5% is paid are independent entities. Using the same name as the store suggests a somewhat cavalier approach to tax law, but the stores do take care to ensure that notional control is such that they are not in the same VAT group, which would be fatal to the scheme. </p> <p>The judge found that a separate contract is entered into by a customer who signs a card slip acknowledging that 2.5% will be paid to the merchant company. This 2.5% is thus for financial services which are VAT exempt. Of course, no refund is given to the customer and money that should go in tax finds its way back into the pockets of the already wealthy retailers. </p> <p>VAT registered self-employed people who use cards to make purchases in such shops should, strictly speaking, only claim back VAT on 97.5% of the transaction. </p> <p>The Treasury is concerned that retailers might now increase the charge. It could even be applied to cash and cheque payments, which also need to be processed in some way. </p> <p>The matter will be ruled on by the European Court and probably the Court of Appeal, but until the loophole is closed, billions of pounds of tax could be avoided. </p> <p>Those who are particularly nauseated by the scheme could try crossing out the words when they sign the card slip. More effective might be a letter to the store, copied to the C&amp;E, saying that not withstanding any pro forma signed at the checkout they do not agree to contract with the merchant company when paying in the store. </p> <p>Store card holders who quote their number may be particularly effective in doing this. The store would then be faced with the choice between two administrative nightmares: refusing to let that person shop or paying VAT at the full rate on their transactions. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Richard Colbey is a barrister</p>",
  "Half a million workers over the age of 65 have no right to claim compensation for unfair dismissal or redundancy if they lose their jobs, the court of appeal ruled in a test case yesterday. <p>John Rutherford, 72, and Samuel Bentley, 76, challenged legislation which denies employment rights to workers past 65 and initially won a landmark victory at an employment tribunal in 2001. </p> <p>But the trade and industry secretary, who would have been liable to pay any com-pensation after the men's employers went out of business, went to the employment appeal tribunal and got the decision overturned last year. </p> <p>Yesterday three judges at the appeal court in London endorsed that ruling. </p> <p>Lord Justice Mummery, handing down the judgment, said the employment rights of many thousands of older employees rested on the result of the case, but he refused to give leave to appeal to the law lords. </p> <p>Mr Rutherford, of Rainham in Essex, and Mr Bentley, from Islington in north London, are now considering whether to petition the law lords to hear the case, or to go to the European court of justice. </p> <p>The two men had argued that the upper age limit contravened sex discrimination laws because it affected men more than women. Statistics show many more men than women keep working after 65. </p> <p>But the appeal court said the employment tribunal had erred in law when it focused only on the over-65s in deciding whether the age limit adversely affected men. </p> <p>It should have looked at the whole workforce in deciding whether the requirement to be under 65 to qualify for employment protection bore more harshly on one sex than the other. That would have shown that the difference was negligible, since the percentage of men and women workers under 65 is roughly equal - around 99%. </p> <p>Gordon Lishman, the director general of Age Concern, said: \"This judgment is a kick in the teeth for older people in work. The outcome of this appeal means that age discrimination remains acceptable in the workplace, denying employment rights to all those working beyond 65. </p> <p>\"But the government has a chance to rectify its actions. If it is bold it will deliver equality for people of all ages by scrapping mandatory retirement ages and offering full employment protection to all.\" </p> <p>Mr Lishman added: \"Half a million people are currently working beyond 65 and should have the same workplace rights and protection as everyone else. It is disgraceful that they are denied legal protection.\" </p> <p>Both men were over 65 when they lost their jobs in the clothing industry, only to discover that the law barred them from claiming a statutory redundancy payment or compensation for unfair dismissal. </p> <p>Mr Rutherford was 67 when he was made redundant from his job as a production pattern room controller at Harvest Town Circle Limited. Mr Bentley was 73 when he was dismissed from his tailor's job when Bodner Elem Limited went into receivership.</p>",
  "<p>It's one of life's financial nightmares. Your debit card has expired, but its replacement hasn't turned up. With visions of the thief quietly booking his annual holiday using your card, you ring and cancel it. Infuriatingly, it turns up a couple of days later. </p> <p>Last week, hundreds of Nationwide customers were left waiting for replacement Visa debit cards after the building society experienced delays in getting new cards out to its Flex (current) account customers. Some of its branch staff were forced to call the inundated cards hotline to find out what was happening to their own cards, only to be told there were delays. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Nationwide said problems were caused by the holiday period but said all customers should have had their replacement cards by the start of the month. However, lots of people who left for work before their post had arrived will not have received them before September 1 when they became active, and may have cancelled their cards. They now face a 7-10 day wait to be given a replacement. </p> <p>Nationwide differs from most of the other banks in that it rarely deviates from using the Royal Mail's standard post and doesn't encourage its customers to collect cards from branches. </p> <p>It says it will use couriers in exceptional circumstances but remains \"comfortable\" using Royal Mail to send out new and replacement cards. </p> <p>Given how much noise the banking community makes about security - and the failure of Royal Mail to meet its delivery targets - it seems incredible that the majority of UK bank customers still receive cards by standard post. </p> <p>The Royal Mail recently ad mitted that 14m pieces of mail never make it to their final destination, and are either lost or stolen, every year. With pin numbers usually sent out a week before the card, there is nothing to stop a thief taking both - particularly if the bank's customer is away, or unaware their card expires at the end of the month. </p> <p>First Direct, part of HSBC, seems on the face of it to be one of the quickest banks to replace cards that never fall on to their customer's doormats, taking \"between two and four days depending on the circumstances\". </p> <p>It still sends out lots of cards using standard first class post but uses couriers if the customer has had a problem in the past or they live in an area in which post regularly goes missing - which a spokeswoman said mostly meant London. It will happily send cards to customers' work address, local HSBC branch or even to a friend's house - with prior agreement. </p> <p>Barclays and Lloyds TSB both adopt a similar policy of using couriers for customers whose accommodation poses a security risk. A spokeswoman for Barclays said it says it will replace \"lost\" cards within five working days, although this usually happens within three days. Lloyds wouldn't say how long it takes but says it will uses a courier \"where the customer's circumstances require it\". </p> <p>The Royal Bank of Scotland, which includes NatWest, is no speedier than Nationwide at replacing cards. Its policy is to replace the card within 10 days - which includes five to seven working days. </p> <p>Interestingly, it sends out its black cards - the ones it gives its most affluent customers (and all new cards) - in an \"inactive state\". Once the customer is in receipt of the card, they simply phone a hotline which will instantly activate it. Until that happens, it can not be used to buy goods or get out cash. </p> <p>One thing in the banks' favour is that most cards being sent out are now chip and pin. These require the user to tap in a pin number when making purchases, and replaces the signature. </p> <p>However, take-up of this has been slow by UK retailers. If you are away on holiday or the thief steals the pin number as well as the card, you'll face a long wait, and possibly a long battle, to get your money back. In such circumstances, it's unlikely the bank will take such a laissez-faire approach to the whole issue of replacement cards. </p> <p><strong>How to beat the cheats</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Be aware when your replacement cards are due - look out for new pin numbers sent by some banks prior to the card's arrival.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you live in accommodation in which you don't have sole access to your post, insist all replacement cards are couriered to you at work or somewhere else you consider to be secure.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> If that's not possible, insist on it being delivered to your local branch.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you have not got the card in your possession by the time it becomes active, cancel it. The short-term inconvenience will be nothing to that you will experience if a thief has taken it and runs amok. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Check the start date is correct before you cut up your existing card.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you have a card protection policy contact the insurer to tell them the card number has changed.</p>",
  "The two French journalists held by Islamist militants in Iraq are safe and could be freed at any time, the most influential Sunni Muslim organisation in Baghdad said yesterday. <p>Sheikh Abdel Salam al-Kobeissi, of the Committee of Ulema, was quoted by French radio as saying that Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro and Christian Chesnot of Radio France Internationale were \"out of danger\" and that their liberation was \"now just a question of time\". </p> <p>The news followed earlier doubts about which radical group was now holding the pair. The managing editor of Le Figaro, Jean de Belot, said on Thursday night that the men had been handed over to a guerrilla group known to favour freeing them. However, an Islamist website published what it claimed was a statement from the Islamic Army in Iraq, the pair's original captors, saying it was still holding them and would announce its decision on their fate \"soon\". But no trace of the statement could be found anywhere else, and its authenticity remained in doubt. </p> <p>While urging caution, a delegation from the French Muslim Council, who visited Baghdad and spoke to religious leaders on Thursday, said they, too, believed that the release of the two men - seized on their way to Najaf on August 19 - could be imminent. </p> <p>\"Friday is an extremely important day for Muslims. It is the day of the Friday prayer and the whole Muslim community and the nation is awaiting these men's liberation,\" Muhammad Bechari, one of the delegation's leaders, said from Amman. </p> <p>Another delegation member told French radio: \"I hope the release will happen today. Currently, it's the problem of the hostages' security ... after their release. There is incredible anarchy in Baghdad.\" </p> <p>Officials in Paris said the foreign minister, Michel Barnier, and a team from his ministry were in the French embassy in Amman and were in constant touch with \"a great many\" contacts in Baghdad. </p> <p>France, which opposed the US-led war in Iraq and is seen as among the most pro-Arab of western nations, was stunned by the kidnappings. </p> <p>Paris mounted a diplomatic offensive that garnered an unprecedented degree of support in the Muslim world. </p> <p>The government has rejected the hostage-takers' demand that it withdraw a new law banning all conspicuous symbols of religious faith, including Muslim headscarves, from state schools. The law came into effect without major incident on Thursday. France's Muslim community shared the country's outrage at the kidnappings, and religious leaders urged calm and an avoidance of all confrontation. </p> <p>French diplomats also said yesterday that, in the light of the still unresolved crisis, the Iraqi interim president, Ghazi al-Yawer, had postponed a trip to Paris that was due to have begun next week.</p>",
  "The French papers were reassured yesterday by suggestions that diplomatic efforts to release two journalists held hostage in Iraq might be paying off. Terrorists had demanded that France repeal a law banning Islamic headscarves in state schools - which came into effect when pupils returned to school this week - in exchange for their freedom. The French government has since warned the public that the hostages' safety remains far from assured. <p>G\u00e9rard Dupuy in <b>Lib\u00e9ration</b> praised the French government for using \"all the powers at its disposal\" to secure the journalists' release, including \"all the goodwill\" won by Jacques Chirac for refusing to be part of the coalition in Iraq. \"The truly exceptional commitment demonstrated by many Middle Eastern leaders (not generally known for their humanitarian activism) in their efforts to free the hostages shows that they accord special treatment to France,\" Dupuy concluded. </p> <p>The crisis had inspired \"an avalanche of support\", declared Jacques Guyon in <b>Le Telegramme</b>, a regional daily. \"Chiefs of state, religious dignitaries of all creeds, tribal chiefs and even political groups ... like Hamas - everyone has condemned the kidnapping.\" </p> <p>The extremists \"have missed their political target\", claimed an editorial in <b>Le Monde</b>. \"Far from dividing the French Muslim community\", the kidnapping \"aroused a feeling of national communion\", and French Muslims were \"first in line to defend the Republic\". </p> <p>The pupils returning to school this week \"have given us a lesson in public-spiritedness\" by respecting the new law, reckoned Lib\u00e9ration's Jean-Michel Thenard. <b>Le Figaro</b>'s Ivan Rioufol felt \"unanimous praise\" was due to the Muslim representatives in France for their \"impeccable patriotism\", but felt that they had no choice but to react in this way - against the wishes of terrorists. </p> <p>Even though France had not given in to the kidnappers' demands, Jacques Camus in <b>Le R\u00e9publique du Centre</b> concluded it would still have to pay for the hostages' release - \"both at home, where the Muslim community is waiting for a sign of gratitude, and abroad, where the spectacular support of Arab-Muslim nations is going to make some of our old alliances a little more difficult.\"</p>",
  "<p> <strong>I was 13 and waiting for a train at Hammersmith</strong> with a group of other kids on our way home from an audition. But my agent insisted we go to Ealing to audition for a new series called Grange Park. When we got there 500 kids were waiting to see Colin Cant, the producer and director of this new series.

He said it showed I had a real cheek about me, just like Tucker. We started shooting the series, which was renamed Grange Hill, on my14th birthday.

He used to say that what we did out of work was our business, but at work we shouldn't mess about. I did a few times and on one occasion he told me to remember where I was and get on with the job. Because of him I became more disciplined and focused. He rarely got angry, but when he did he never swore. He was too much of a gentleman for that.</p> <p><strong>Colin was the doyen of children's drama</strong> at the time and quite well known. Anybody who has worked with him will tell you that they'll never forget the experience because he always got the best out of people.

  "<p><strong>The Lover, by Laura Wilson (Orion, \u00a39.99)</strong></p> <p>Inspired by the little-known true case of the \"Blackout Ripper\", which received little coverage as the Blitz took precedence at the time, this is a tense and intelligent psychological thriller that confirms Laura Wilson's seat at the high table of British crime writing. Five prostitutes have been discovered, dead and mutilated, in as many weeks in Soho alleyways while the city is under constant attack by the German airforce.</p> <p>Flashback to an unexpected encounter in an air-raid shelter as we follow many of the doomed protagonists of this affecting story. Wilson uses the historical background as a springboard for a meticulous reconstruction of 1940s social mores and the way war disturbs the moral compass of otherwise honourable people. Seldom has the anatomy of fear, compulsion and deviancy been so closely detailed. Quite terrifying and sadly believable.</p> <p><strong>The Mammoth Book of Roaring Twenties Whodunnits, edited by Mike Ashley (Robinson, \u00a37.99)</strong></p> <p>One might say that the Jazz Age, chronicled by F Scott Fitzgerald and others, was the final stand of innocence before the rougher years of the Great Depression and the spread of gangsterism across America. This splendid collection of mystery stories set during those hedonistic years is a joy, encompassing the novelty of developments like the telephone and radio, the glamour of Hollywood silents and the worryingly thin veneer that separated the dazzle from the worm festering beneath the surface. There are 23 stories from established and modern British and American writers like Cornell Woolrich, Max Allan Collins, HRF Keating, Peter Lovesey and others. Many were written specially for this volume, and none disappoints.</p>",
  "<p>When, five or six years ago, Joyce Carol Oates came to write Blonde , a 939-page re-imagining of the life of Marilyn Monroe, the trigger was not any particular interest in Monroe - \"whom I scarcely knew, and didn't much admire because I didn't know\" - but a photograph of Monroe taken when she was 17 and called Norma Jean Baker. \"And she looks nothing like Marilyn Monroe. She looks like girls I went to high school with, or grade school. She reminded me in her wistful way of my own mother.\" Through Norma Jeane, as her name is spelled in Blonde , Oates could attempt to understand the world her much-loved parents came from (\"so impoverished, and desperate\") - but she had also found a story that contained, to a mythic degree, the preoccupations she has returned to throughout her career: the power and vulnerability of adolescent girls; the damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don't trap of femininity, of beauty; the political theatre - the second world war, McCarthyism, JFK; the daydream/nightmare of 20th-century America, and above all, \"class struggle. I'm always writing in some way about class struggle. It's a subject that many American writers don't write about because they're so comfortable.\" </p> <p>Oates is now herself one of the comfortable. She teaches at Princeton, and lives, with her husband Raymond Smith, in an affluent suburb of that New Jersey town, in a light-filled structure of wood and glass set among mature trees. The living-room walls are covered in art. On the occasional tables there is more art: three glass boxes filled with found objects - Prizes I Won at Coney Island , Oates's favourite; Mirror, Mirror (a confection spun from shards of glass); and Marilyn and a Few Others, inspired by Blonde - by Oates's friend, the New York socialite and heiress Gloria Vanderbilt. Like Monroe, Oates moves among household names. She refuses to say which American writers she admires because, as she says in her nasal, unhurried voice, \"these people are my friends, and I can't really name 12 friends\". </p> <p>And if Monroe (as opposed to Norma Jeane) was larger than life, so too is Oates the writer: however much she wishes it otherwise - she is distinctly sharp with those who broach the subject - it's difficult to avoid commenting on how much Oates there is. Nearly every review of an Oates book, it seems, begins with a list, which, from this autumn, is: 42 novels (nine under the pseudonym \"Rosamund Smith\", one by \"Lauren Kelly\"); five novellas; 19 short-story collections; eight books of poetry; seven volumes of plays; nine of essays; two books for young adults; and two books for children - 94 in total, not counting the volumes she has edited; the book reviews and magazine pieces; the rumoured stacks of unpublished manuscripts at her publishers' and in bottom drawers; or the dozen practice novels she wrote before she was 18. </p> <p>She reads on a similar scale: her conversation ranges from Trollope to Dickinson, from \"my friend Norman Mailer\" to Hilary Mantel, from Poe to James (Henry and William) and back, again and again, to Lewis Carroll. Ask about how she writes, and she compares her method with DH Lawrence (forward-plunging, intuitive) and James Joyce (schematic, highly controlled, highly edited) - she believes she employs the latter, though others don't necessarily agree. \"She writes an onrushing kind of prose crackling with emotional tumult,\" says the New Yorker's poetry editor Alice Quinn, who has published some of Oates's verse; she attempted to excerpt Blonde but it proved difficult to corral. \"It has a mimetic quality, where the prose is mirroring the onrush of feeling.\" </p> <p>Oates's critical reception has always lurched between the glowing and the virulent. For every critic or peer who argues that she ranks among the most important authors of 20th-century America, there's a Michiko Kakutani (who, as chief critic for the New York Times, takes a position of serial disappointment); or a James Wolcott (she \"slop[s] words across a page like a washerwoman flinging soiled water across the cobblestones\"); or, occasionally, a Truman Capote: \"To me, she's the most loathsome creature in America. She's a joke monster who ought to be beheaded in a public auditorium.\" </p> <p>The latter two suffer, as reactions to Oates often do, from entangling the quality of her work with resentment of her productivity and a certain kind of misogyny. \"I think it's less of an accusatory phenomenon if the writer is a man,\" says Oates, wearily. And she has had to pay no obvious price, adds her friend, critic Elaine Showalter. \"She's not an alcoholic, not a drug addict, not crazy, she has no broken marriages - it's a visceral superstition, that to get away with this she must have a pact with the devil.\" </p> <p>\"We have a bond in that we've come out of similar backgrounds, and I too am accused of writing too much,\" says John Updike, who has corresponded with Oates for many years, \"but if you approach the writing business seriously and try to set it up like an orderly activity, as opposed to devoting your energy to the pursuit of the good life and happiness and drugs and drink and celebrity, you write an alarming amount over the course of a lifetime. We're blue-collar writers.\" \"I don't think I'm fanatic or obsessive about working,\" she answers, testily, when I ask if she's done any writing that morning. This depends on your definition of obsessive. \"Wherever she is, she's writing,\" says Daniel Halpern, her editor at Ecco and a friend for 30 years. \"In cars, in airports, on planes, if she's at party and no one's talking to her she's writing. She's completely focused, and makes use of every moment.\" </p> <p>In a recent, and, according to Oates, perceptive New York Review of Books essay, Caroline Fraser argues that \"Oates's primary subject is victimhood, and her work features a kind of Grand Guignol of every imaginable form of physical, psychological, and sexual violence: rape, incest, murder, molestation, cannibalism, torture, bestiality... no American writer has devoted herself with more disquieting intensity to the experience and consequences of being victimised, a devotion that seems, strangely, to have inspired a kind of reactionary violence all its own.\" (In turn, she has an unfortunate habit of replying robustly to negative reviews.) </p> <p>\"I think serious art is transgressive, and that if you upset people, they're likely to wish to punish you,\" says Oates, who appears to find such punishment nourishing: in an essay collected in The Faith of a Writer: Life, Craft, Art (2003) she writes, \"I have to concede: the more we are hurt, the more we seek solace in the imagination. Ironically... the more imaginative work we create in this solitude, and publish, the more likely we are to be hurt by critical and public reaction to it; and so, again, we retreat into the imagination - assuring that more hurt will ensue. A bizarre cycle. Yet it makes a kind of sense.\" But beyond all the essentially extratextual responses is a legitimate unease about the nature of her vast achievement. \"As she herself has said,\" says Updike, \"she's a somewhat isolated figure, there's nobody really like her, not only in terms of the productivity and the versatility, but in terms of a certain Dreiserian earnestness.\" Furthermore, \"the writers we tend to universally admire, like Beckett, or Kafka, or TS Eliot, are not very prolific. The small choice body of work is what we like and instead we get Joyce Carol Oates's Victorian productivity, without the Victorian audience. She is, in a way, out of her time.\" </p> <p>And while he admires her project, her whole approach, \"you don't very often, as you do in so many less productive writers, encounter a gem. There are very few stories or moments that couldn't be any better put. There's a slight hastiness to her prose, which prevents her perhaps from giving the kind of delight that some writers do.\" </p> <p>Because of the violence and reach of her work, says novelist Russell Banks, who also taught at Princeton, \"I expected to meet a formidable, large personality, so I was surprised, because she seemed so frail and vulnerable.\" Margaret Drabble, who became a friend when Oates and her husband went to London for a sabbatical year in 1971, remembers her being \"extremely elegant in an extremely pale way, with very red lips - very Gothic, which was not at all the fashion. I was impressed that such a frail-looking person should have produced such iron work.\" Oates is tall, and strikingly pale. In her physical presence, as in her prose, \"Joyce is not like other people,\" says former student Jonathan Safran Foer, who acknowledges that he would not have begun his Guardian First Book award-winning novel, Everything is Illuminated , would not have aspired to write, without her encouragement; she read drafts every two weeksuntil it was finished. \"She's ghostly, ethereal. It's almost like she doesn't touch surfaces.\" She can almost disappear in company, and yet, says Halpern, \"put her in front of 2,000 people and she is hysterical. She's one of the best stand-up speakers among writers I've heard.\" </p> <p>Oates believes, emphatically, \"that our best selves, our most complex selves, are not our social selves. I consider myself a transparent personality.\" When we meet she's reading Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn's The Master, and \"what I like about it is that the Henry James he is creating is like a ghost - he doesn't say much. It's a novel that's almost about nothing - but it's a novel that I can identify with. I feel that the writer is like an observer at the margin. So when I write about characters who seem to have my background, they're nothing like me in terms of personality.\" </p> <p>Oates grew up in Millersport, New York, which \"was hardly a community, it was a farm and another farm, and a creek\". In \"They All Just Went Away\" (1995), collected in the Best American Essays of the Century (2000, edited by Oates and Robert Atwan), she writes that \"ours was a happy, close-knit and unextraordinary family for our time, place and economic status\" - an experience unlike that of her parents. Her father, Frederic Oates, grew up fatherless, and left school for work as a sign painter very young, and then did various manufacturing jobs; after a lifetime of labour he went to university in the late 1980s. Joyce's mother Carolina was of Hungarian descent, one of nine children; when her father was beaten to death in a tavern brawl, her mother could not cope, and though Joyce did not discover this until middle age, \"my mother was given away, she never knew her father. And Marilyn Monroe had a mother who didn't love her - couldn't love her, basically, because of her mental imbalance, and she never knew her father.\" </p> <p>It's a typical Oates progression, and has its roots in a proper respect for the power of chance. She began her education in the same one-room schoolhouse as her mother, but changes in population meant she was bussed to a better city school; when the district changed again, she went to an even better school in a suburb of Buffalo, which was sending students to Harvard, Princeton, Yale - she won a scholarship to Syracuse. These coincidences meant she was the first person in her family to finish high school, let alone university. \"If I hadn't been able to go to high school, I basically wouldn't have any thing - I wouldn't be here. It's a bittersweet thing, because you want to feel pride in what you've done, but when you come from that kind of background you remember when you were kids, and you don't feel that you're that different.\" She has a brother, Fred Jnr, who is five years younger, and on Joyce's 18th birthday, a sister was born, Lynn Ann, who is severely autistic. \"She's never uttered one word - she can't speak. It's very extreme, the brain is probably really damaged - so that could have been me, very easily. She and I look like each other. I think much of my life is a consequence of accident and luck.\" </p> <p>It isn't far-fetched to say that a large amount of Oates's fiction can be seen as explorations into what might have been; generally, what could have gone wrong. (Though chance itself doesn't translate into fiction \"because it doesn't make for a coherent narrative. It doesn't seem to mean anything.\") So in Monroe's case, for example, genetic luck and hard work and talent played their part - only to be scuppered by neediness. When Oates was writing Blonde , \"the most difficult novel for me to write\", she told Greg Johnson, her biographer, that she pinned some invented words of Norma Jeane's by her desk: \"I guess I never believed that I deserved to live. The way other people do. I needed to justify my life. How many of us, I wonder, feel exactly the same way!\" </p> <p>In \"They All Just Went Away\", she evokes the Hopperesque upstate New York landscape that formed her and is a constant in her work: \"A gone-to-seed landscape had an authority that seemed to me incontestable: the powerful authority of silence in houses from which the human voice had vanished.\" She would explore these houses, staring in distaste at \"filthy mattresses streaked with yellow and rust-coloured stains... The most terrible punishment, I thought, would be to lie down on such a mattress.\" It is no surprise, then, that in the title story of Haunted: Tales of the Grotesque (1994), a girl is forced on to the mattress by a ghost who subjects her to unspoken things; the biographical nugget is revisited but shot through with darkness, supernatural dread. Even before she could read she was making little books of pictures, and when her grandmother gave her a copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland she found in fiction both a salvation and, in the fierce young girl unphased by monsters and the threatening mutability of dreams, a way of going forth into the world. For if she was lucky in some ways, in others she was not: the violence of her books is not so far from the reality she knew. The farm boys, trained to hunt animals, were accomplished bullies, and in her journal, Johnson writes, she recalls witnessing \"so many brutal, meaningless acts... incredible cruelty, profanity, obscenity... even (it was bragged) incest between a boy of about 13 and his six-year-old sister.\" </p> <p>Oates herself was semi-molested, an experience she revisits in her short story \"The Molesters\", for example, or in the elliptically autobiographical Marya: A Life (1986). Johnson makes the case for such writing as self-therapy, and she did finally come to see, as she puts it in a 1999 essay, \"Running and Writing\" (she is a keen runner), \"that such abuse is generic, not personal... it allows us insight into the experiences of others, a sense of what a more enduring panic, entrapment, suffering and despair must be truly like.\" </p> <p>Oates is \"unique in American literature in her compassion and understanding of adolescent girls\", says Banks. \"She has made them memorable - humanised and dignified them.\" She mines a rich vein of intense, fraught adolescence; its embattled, brief innocence and power, often combined with the particular difficulties of being clever in a rural area, or the self-protective watchfulness of a young woman who finds herself among those of a different class. \"I connect so much to the young person,\" she says; and credits some of her characteristically mesmeric momentum - in Wonderland , for example, or Because It Is Bitter - to writing about \"a young person evolving and having spiritual and intellectual and emotional discoveries.\" </p> <p>She has often said that her first literary heroes were men - Faulkner, Carroll, Poe, Dostoevsky, Lawrence; she writes well about men, and often from a male point of view; she seems especially fascinated by inarticulate male aggression and drive, shame and honour, not infrequently as they affect issues of race (some of her best writing, says Quinn, is about interracial love affairs); and she is a famously incongruous boxing fan. A common criticism is that the women connected to these men are so often passive, suffering/ accepting, but this is fairly consistent with the worldview of one who has asked: \"Are there any adult women who have not been in one way or another, sexually molested or threatened?\" She has a tragic sense generally, says Showalter, but an especially tragic sense of femininity - \"She thinks that women are so often mistreated for being feminine, beautiful, or not beautiful enough,\" - and Blonde , of course, is \"paradigmatic\"; in a story from 1970, \"Unmailed, Unwritten Letters\", Oates writes: \"Women who are loved are in perpetual motion, dancing. We dance and men follow to the brink of madness and death, but what of us, the dancers?\" </p> <p>After Syracuse University, where she blossomed (though she also suffered a breakdown due to overwork, and discovered she had a heart condition), Oates studied for an MA at the University of Wisconsin, and there she met her husband, Ray. She did not enjoy the MA, but Ray, a PhD candidate who would become a professor of 18th-century literature, was her other great stroke of luck, \"because my marriage is really a marriage of like minds - both my husband and I are so interested in literature and we read the same books; he'll be reading a book and then I'll read it - we trade and we talk about our reading at meal times.\" They run the Ontario Press, which publishes books, including some of Oates's, and a literary magazine. \"We design covers for the books, we design the magazine - so it's a very collaborative and imaginative marriage, and that isn't typical of many marriages\". And also, importantly, he is not in competition with her. Oates is like Simone de Beauvoir, says Showalter, \"but there's no Jean-Paul Sartre, no egomaniacal little guy she's going to sacrifice herself for.\" They have never had children. </p> <p>Smith's first teaching job was in Beaumont, Texas; they lasted a year, then, in 1962, moved to Detroit, where they both taught. Oates has done so ever since: her classes in creative writing and English literature keep her in touch with young people, and with the world in general; they also allow her to do \"very close readings of Henry James or Faulkner or Hemingway, in a way that you never do with your friends\". Prompted partly by the Vietnam war, partly by the 1967 Detroit race riots, but mainly by a joint job offer, they crossed Lake Ontario to the University of Windsor, Canada, in 1968; 16 years later they moved to Princeton. </p> <p>Now that Oates has been publishing for 45 years, an arc is evident. The first phase, realist, traditional, Dreiserian, draws heav ily on her rural youth, and on the grit and volatility of Detroit. The novel that made her famous, earning a National Book award and putting her on the cover of Newsweek, was them (1969), a dystopian saga of a poor white Detroit family hurtling towards the conflagration of the race riots: it prompted Harold Bloom to say: \"What I myself find most moving in Oates is her immense empathy with the insulted and injured, her deep identification with the American lower classes. She is not a political novelist, not a social revolutionary in any merely overt way, and yet she is our true proletarian novelist.\" </p> <p>More successful, as a novel, is Wonderland (1971), a meditation on the \"phantasmagoria of personality\", which follows Jesse from rural New York State (his father, unmanned by the depression, kills the rest of the family in a murder-suicide), to a foster family, to success as a neurosurgeon: it was written, and reads, breathlessly, exhaustingly. \"Like virtually all my novels,\" wrote Oates in an afterword added 20 years later, \"Wonderland is political in genesis\"; set against Vietnam and the assassination of JFK, \" Wonderland , as a title, refers to both America, as a region of wonders, and the human brain, as a region of wonders. And 'wonders' can be both dream and nightmare.\" </p> <p>One of the nightmares, recounted with vivid, stylised disgust, is Jesse's horrifically fat foster family; obesity is, for Oates, a \"spiritual obscenity\", and food, generally, a difficult area. In the essay \"Food Mysteries\" she describes the appeal of anorexia: \"Without appetite, steadily losing weight and noting with grim pleasure how readily flesh melts from your bones, you experience the anorexic's fatally sweet revelation: I am not this , after all.\" Her literary voraciousness (you just mention a thing, says Showalter, and \"Joyce will have the novel by next week\") has got her into trouble: Johnson details how colleagues at the University of Windsor, for example, were unimpressed to find their private lives in stories. Gene McNamara, the possible model for a story about an adulterer whose lover's husband murders her, is tight-lipped about whether she wrote about him, but clear about how it made people feel: \"Bitter\". The collection, appropriately, was called The Hungry Ghosts. Anorexia is essentially about control; there is often the sense, in her fiction, that sanity is only just maintained, that superhuman effort is required to hold things together, or they will - in a recurring phrase - fly apart like \"shattering glass\". \"I think I feel that less personally myself,\" says Oates now, \"but I feel there's a certain madness in America, a frenzy, an intoxication, and we are, collectively, a very paranoid people who are forever projecting on to others our own ideas of who they are, like Bush - we're good people and they're evil people - it's so simple-minded.\" </p> <p>In her second phase, most of the early 80s, she moved into other worlds, with five hugely complex, postmodernist gothic novels, her stated ambition to capture \"America as viewed through the prismatic lens of its most popular genres\". For the ever-present threat of the dissolution of self, says Oates, is also a \"gothic theme, central in Poe, HP Lovecraft, the great gothic writers\". In the introduction to her selection of major works of Lovecraft (Ecco, 1998), she calls the gothic tale \"a form of psychic autobiography\", and says now that \"It seems to me that the gothic ties in with surrealism, and surrealism actually ties in with fairy tales, and my earliest love, Alice. It's not that much of a stretch to go from the Wonderland world, the looking-glass world, to Lovecraft - the monsters, and shifting shapes. I don't think of gothic as being that different from the writing of Kafka - it's psychologically surreal writing - I feel very much at home with that, because I think our minds are like that.\" </p> <p> Bellefleur (1980) was her first bestseller, but the gothic novels are a very specific taste, and the rest did not do well. She returned to realism and as well as seizing upon and transmogrifying a moment in her own history, she has been writing more fiction based on stories in the public domain, such as Black Water (1992, based on Chappaquiddick); Zombie (1995, written from the point of view of a Jeffrey Dahmer-like serial killer), and, of course, Blonde. Black Water was nominated for a Pulitzer, as was What I Lived For (1994); We Were the Mulvaneys (1996) was an Oprah choice. Short stories appear regularly, and although they receive less attention, many feel they are what will last. Increasingly, she is also writing plays: by 1995 there had been 60 productions in America, though they are not all enthusiastically received: the critic Vincent Canby has commented on her limited engagement with contemporary culture. </p> <p>This year she publishes two novels, The Tattooed Girl, which tackles antisemitism, and The Falls, a tragic love story set at Niagara Falls; another, Blood at the Root , about race relations in the aftermath of Watergate, is written. In a 1973 essay, \"Notes on Failure\", Oates offers an explanation, of sorts. \"Success is distant and illusory, failure one's loyal companion, one's stimulus for imagining that the next book will be better, for otherwise, why write? The impulse can be made to sound theoretical, and even philosophical, but it is... as physical as our blood and marrow. 'This insatiable desire to write something before I die, this ravaging sense of the shortness and feverishness of life, make me cling... to my one anchor' - so Virginia Woolf, in her diary, speaks for us all.\"</p> <p><strong> Joyce Carol Oates Born:</strong> June 16 1938.</p> <p><strong> Educated:</strong> 1956-60 Syracuse University; '60-61 University of Wisconsin.</p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1961- Raymond Smith.</p> <p><strong> Some Books: </strong> 1963 By the North Gate; '66 Upon the Sweeping Flood and Other Stories; '67 Garden of Earthly Delights; '69 them; '71 Wonderland; '73 Do With Me What You Will; '80 Bellefleur; '82 A Bloodsmoor Romance; '86 Marya: A Life; '87 You Must Remember This; '87 On Boxing; '90 Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart; '92 Black Water; '93 Foxfire: Confessions of a Girl Gang; Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?: Selected Early Stories; '94 Haunted: Tales of the Grotesque; '95 Zombie; '96 We Were the Mulvaneys; 2000 Blonde; '01 Faithless: Tales of Transgression; '04 The Tattooed Girl, The Falls.</p>",
  "To anyone who remembers the way that past sieges ended in the Caucasus, the chaotic scenes in Beslan were horribly familiar. The storming of the school was not planned. A group of four doctors arrived in a van to collect the bodies of the dead killed in the initial shooting three days ago. The building was rocked by two large explosions, one of them a black widow suicide bomber blowing herself up. The Chechen gunmen split into groups, 13 bursting out of the building, others, including the lead hostage-taker, blockading themselves inside a basement. If the Chechens were prepared, the Russian special forces were not. The special forces, who claimed they had the school surrounded, had not done so. Neither had the security forces sealed off the surrounding area or evacuated the town. Beslan instantly became a bedlam of armed Chechens and hostages - all trying to flood out of the school - and special forces, armed Ossetians, emergency workers, firemen, camera crews and relatives - all trying to fight their way in. No one could have identified friend or foe. At one point in this frenzied melee, a crowd of angry Ossetians set on a hostage-taker who had surrendered and was being led out of the building. Six hours after the initial storming, gunfire was still coming from one part of the school and there was a report that some children were still being held hostage. <p>But no one can blame the Russian special forces for the scene inside the sports hall, where hundreds of women and children lay captive. They had stripped off their clothes in the sauna like heat, and deprived of water by their captors, some began to drink their own urine. The hostage-takers had run two wires between the two basket ball hoops and hung mines off them. They had laid mines all around the building. True to their word, they detonated them. Only two of the mines worked, but the roof collapsed on the children. Over 100 of them are thought to have died in that blast alone. Russia does not need to make the case that nine of the hostage-takers were thought to be not of Chechen but Arabic origin. Statements such as these are grist to the mill that Chechnya is just another front in the worldwide war on terror, Caucasian surrogates of al-Qaida. The horror of the scene inside the sports hall provokes enough revulsion at the methods now used by those who claim they are fighting to free their country of Russian occupiers. </p> <p>With his security forces still not in control and with gunfire ringing around Beslan, Vladimir Putin may well be urged by his advisers to launch a final military onslaught on rebels in Chechnya. History tells us it will not be final, but public opinion in Russia is highly volatile after a week which has seen two Russian airliners brought down by Chechen suicide bombers and now a whole town in North Ossetia ravaged by a Chechen militant raid. Under attack from inevitable accusations that his crack troops were unprepared, Putin will be tempted to act. He has already laid the groundwork internationally for a fresh military onslaught by getting the United Nations security council to condemn the raid. His adviser on Chechnya, Aslanbek Aslakhanov, has already spoken ominously about the Arab origin of some of the fighters. If Mr Putin does launch another crackdown, it will be impossible for Washington or London to restrain him. However much they know that Chechnya is more complicated than simply another theatre of al-Qaida's war, they also know they have a pact with the Russian president. Now he may be about to cash in his chips.</p>",
  "The children who survive the Beslan siege will be given group therapy and one-on-one counselling sessions in the coming months to help them in their struggle to come to terms with the ordeal. <p>A team of child counsellors was flown into Beslan at the start of the crisis and has been on standby, ready to help survivors cope with their horrific experience. Psychiatrists trained in stress counselling will meet teachers, relatives and even neighbours of those families affected. </p> <p>Bereavement support and post-traumatic stress are relatively new concepts in Russia, but expertise in this field has developed radically in the years since the Soviet Union collapsed and scientists were able to share information with colleagues in the west. </p> <p>Boris Voskresensky, a psychiatrist and academic with the Russian State Medical University in Moscow, said: \"There wasn't much understanding of the concept of post-traumatic stress a decade ago. It's no longer the case that people are expected to have Stalinist characteristics of strength and stoicism in the face of crisis. There's a much greater readiness among doctors now to help people deal psychologically with this kind of catastrophe.\" </p> <p>The counsellors would focus on helping the families of those affected, he said. \"They need to be alerted to the possible secondary effects of the trauma, which may take months or even years to develop,\" he added. \"Parents and teachers need to be made aware that their children may develop psychosomatic illnesses, that their school work could suffer, that their behaviour may deteriorate.\" </p> <p>Chechen child refugees, exiled from their homes by the long-running war, have been helped by doctors working for NGOs (non-governmental organisations) in the refugee camps of Ingushetia. </p> <p>\"Everything depends on the strength of the child's relations with his family. If they can help the children build a peaceful, quiet and stable life in the next few years, then this event shouldn't blight their lives forever,\" Dr Voskresensky said. \"Whether or not children living in this part of the world can expect to have a peaceful life is another matter.\" </p> <p>Irina Angel, a child psychiatrist who was born in Grozny, but is now practising in Boston, said she believed doctors in the Caucasus were not as advanced as those in the capital. \"In my experience there will be a much greater emphasis on coming to terms with tragedy through family support, that of the community and through religion. There may still be a reluctance to talk about this with psychiatrists,\" she said. </p> <p>Dr Morris Zwi, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at South-west London and St George's mental health trust, said the children caught up in the Russian school had suffered such profound trauma that they may have flashbacks and nightmares for years, if not the rest of their lives. \"They were exposed to overwhelming stress and fear, where events were not only beyond their control, but beyond that of the adults caring for them,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Many will experience extreme anxiety, hyper-vigilance and wariness, nightmares and sleeplessness, and in some cases, any reminder will trigger graphic flashbacks, as it did for Vietnam vets hearing a helicopter overhead and suddenly believing they were back in Vietnam.\"</p>"
